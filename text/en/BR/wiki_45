<text>WrestleMania XX was a 2004 professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was the 20th annual WrestleMania and took place on March 14, 2004, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York, marking the third WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden (after WrestleMania I in 1985 and WrestleMania X in 1994) and the fourth of six WrestleManias in the New York metropolitan area (alongside WrestleMania I, 2, X, 29, and 35). It featured professional wrestlers from both of the promotion&#x27;s two brand divisions – Raw and SmackDown!. To this date it is the last WrestleMania to have been held at the Garden. Its calendar date of March 14 also stands as the earliest that WrestleMania has ever been held in any year.

The match card featured two main events. The pay-per-view main event, which was also the main match for the Raw brand, was a triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which saw champion Triple H defending the world title against Shawn Michaels, and that year&#x27;s Royal Rumble match winner, Chris Benoit. Benoit won the match, making Triple H submit via the Crippler Crossface, resulting in his first and only world championship in the WWE. The main match for the SmackDown! brand featured Eddie Guerrero versus Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship, which Guerrero won by a Small Package pin. The event also featured the return of The Undertaker in his Deadman persona, who defeated Kane, after a Tombstone Piledriver. John Cena made his in-ring WrestleMania debut at the event, by defeating Big Show to win his first title in WWE, the WWE United States Championship.

Also on the card was a match between Goldberg and Brock Lesnar, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee. This was both Lesnar&#x27;s and Goldberg&#x27;s final match with WWE until the 2012 edition of Extreme Rules, and the 2016 edition of Survivor Series, respectively. After Goldberg won the match following a Jackhammer, both men were given a Stone Cold Stunner by Austin on their way out. The event also featured the in-ring return of The Rock, teaming up with Mick Foley and reuniting the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection to take on Evolution in a 3-on-2 Handicap match, in which Evolution were victorious. This would be The Rock&#x27;s final match in WWE until Survivor Series 2011.

The event grossed $2.4 million in ticket sales, making the pay-per-view the highest grossing event ever for WWE at Madison Square Garden. More than 20,000 people from 16 countries and 48 states attended the event, which was also televised in more than 90 countries. The event generated an estimated $13.5 million of economic activity for New York City and created an equivalent of 96 full-year jobs.

===Background===

WrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE&#x27;s original four pay-per-views – which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series – referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. WrestleMania XX was scheduled to be held on March 14, 2004, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the third time at this venue, after WrestleMania I in 1985 and WrestleMania X in 1994. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions.

===Storylines===
The event comprised 12 matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE&#x27;s writers on the Raw and SmackDown! brands, while storylines were produced on WWE&#x27;s weekly television shows, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

The main feud heading into the pay-per-view was for the Raw brand, with Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Chris Benoit feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry began on the December 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when Michaels challenged Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship in Michaels&#x27; hometown of San Antonio, Texas. It appeared as if Michaels would win, with the then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff coming into the ring at the last minute and making the pinfall, counting to three for what appeared to be Michaels winning the title. However, as Michaels&#x27; shoulders were on the mat at the same time as Triple H&#x27;s, the match was later declared a draw, and Triple H retained the championship. At the Royal Rumble, Triple H and Michaels again faced each other in a Last Man Standing match for the title, which resulted in another draw. As a result, Triple H retained the title yet again, but leaving open the question as to which of the two truly deserved the championship. Later that night, during the Royal Rumble match, SmackDown!&#x27;s Benoit won the contest by last-eliminating Big Show, after being the first entrant to the event (a feat only 2 other wrestlers had achieved at the time). On the following night, Michaels and Triple H were involved in an in-ring confrontation when Raw&#x27;s Sheriff Steve Austin made his way to the ring. He stated that, although Michaels should have a rematch, he had to &quot;enforce the law&quot;, and that even though the Royal Rumble rules gave the winner of the match a shot at &quot;the (world) championship&quot;, there was not any specification as to which world title that was. Benoit, who at the time was a member of the SmackDown! brand, then came to the ring and said he was taking advantage of the loophole, joining the Raw brand and challenging Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XX. On the February 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, a contract signing took place between Benoit and Triple H. As Triple H signed his name on the paper, Michaels came out to inform Benoit that the last thing he wanted to do is &quot;rain on [his] parade&quot;. He then stated that he, more than anybody, can respect Benoit&#x27;s effort to win the Royal Rumble match and earn a World title shot, but suggested that Benoit should&#x27;ve stayed on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to take care of business while Michaels, himself, was trying to finish his feud with Triple H. Benoit refused to relinquish his guaranteed title shot, resulting in Michaels hitting Benoit with Sweet Chin Music and signing the contract himself. After the two men wrestled a match marred by interference from the champion on the February 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin decided to make Triple H&#x27;s title defense a triple threat match. On the March 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Michaels and Benoit lost to Randy Orton and Batista, Triple H&#x27;s stablemates in Evolution, the entire group attacked Michaels and Benoit, ending with Triple H hitting both with the Pedigree and rubbing his World title belt into their faces while they lied motionless in the ring.

The main feud for the SmackDown! brand was between Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. Angle and Guerrero were initially allies while Guerrero feuded with his nephew Chavo Guerrero. This changed when, on the January 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero last eliminated Angle in a 15-man Royal Rumble match, to earn a shot at the WWE Championship. At No Way Out, Kurt Angle defeated The Big Show and John Cena in a triple threat match to earn a title shot at WrestleMania, and Guerrero defeated Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. On the February 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle was the special guest referee in a WWE Championship match between Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero. As Eddie was about to gain the victory, Angle stopped the 3-count and turned on Guerrero. On the February 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero was eager to get his revenge on Angle, but when he finally saw Angle, he shoved SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman and his assistant Dawn Marie out of his way, only for Heyman to have Guerrero escorted out of the arena by security. Guerrero was scheduled to team with John Cena to take on Chavo Guerrero and the Big Show in a tag team match on that night, but due to Guerrero being escorted out of the arena, he was replaced by Rey Mysterio for the tag match, which Mysterio and Cena won. Later that night, Angle appeared and stated that he attacked Guerrero for the SmackDown! fans and for the WWE. He then referred to Guerrero as a former drug addict who should not represent SmackDown! as the WWE Champion, and stated that, one day, people would be thanking him for giving them a champion to be proud of. Guerrero then re-entered the arena and assaulted Angle until he was arrested on the orders of Heyman. As Guerrero got taken out of the building in handcuffs, Angle made some insulting comments to him, before the officers drove away with Guerrero in the police car. On the March 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, during Guerrero&#x27;s match with Heyman (while he was handcuffed), Angle interfered and knocked him down a few times, until Guerrero defended himself by spitting on Angle. As Guerrero begged Angle to hit him with the WWE Championship belt, Angle did so and raised the title belt over his head to hype their match at Wrestlemania XX.

This was the first WrestleMania to have a match billed as &quot;inter-promotional&quot;, which means that a party from &quot;Raw&quot; would wrestle a party from &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. WWE owner Vince McMahon named three matches to be inter-promotional on the February 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. The first was a tag team match featuring SmackDown!&#x27;s Torrie Wilson and Sable, who had recently been featured in a pictorial in Playboy magazine, against Raw&#x27;s Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, who had protested the decision made by Hugh Hefner not to feature them in his magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/14raw&quot;&gt;edition of February 14, 2004 of &quot;Raw&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On the January 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg came to the ring, and demanded a match between himself and Brock Lesnar, with whom he had problems over the past two months. At the Royal Rumble, Goldberg was entered in the Royal Rumble match, only to have Lesnar (who, as the reigning WWE Champion, was not entered into the match) interfere and execute an F-5, causing Goldberg to be eliminated by Kurt Angle. On the February 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, as a result of the rivalry between the two programs, Sheriff Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending No Way Out by giving him a front-row ticket. At No Way Out, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his front seat by security. Then SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring speech on how &quot;SmackDown!&quot; was the better program than &quot;Raw&quot;. Lesnar then came down to the ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade and entered the ring, where Lesnar performed a running shoulder block to Goldberg&#x27;s stomach and tried to perform another F-5 on him. However, Goldberg countered it and lifted Lesnar vertically in the air before slamming him down in a Jackhammer. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security. During Lesnar&#x27;s WWE title defense against Eddie Guerrero later that night, Goldberg returned to the arena and interfered by executing a Spear, which caused Lesnar to lose the title after Guerrero nailed him with a Frog splash. On the February 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon set the interpromotional singles match as pitting Lesnar versus Goldberg for WrestleMania XX, with Austin as the special guest referee. Later that night during the match between McMahon and Eric Bischoff, Lesnar appeared and nailed Austin with an F-5 then stole Austin&#x27;s four-wheeler. On the February 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Lesnar stated that he appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; just to get back at Austin for giving Goldberg the front-row seat ticket and suggesting that Goldberg would attack Lesnar at No Way Out. Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match would be Goldberg&#x27;s last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, rumors surfaced that Lesnar, too, was leaving, in order to pursue a career in the National Football League. On the March 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Austin appeared to get his four-wheeler back from Lesnar, only for the entire roster to get in his way by orders of SmackDown! General Manager Heyman. Moments later, the entire roster had decided to move aside and let Austin by, to confront Lesnar in the ring. As Austin got into the ring, he and Lesnar traded punches, with Austin ramming Lesnar headfirst into the steel ring post and attempting to nail Lesnar with the Stone Cold Stunner, only for Lesnar to escape, leaving Austin to finally get back his four-wheeler and close the show with his trademark beer bash.

The next match was at the request of Kane, and had its roots in a match at Survivor Series, in which Kane&#x27;s storyline brother, The Undertaker challenged Vince McMahon to a Buried Alive match. Kane interfered in the match and buried his brother under several tons of dirt, apparently killing him. On the November 20 episode of SmackDown!, Kane appeared to give the eulogy for his brother, claiming that The Undertaker was no longer his brother and had died a long time before, as he no longer embraced his dark side. This rewarded him with a match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon, which was won by Triple H in a Triple Threat Match also involving Goldberg. Kane participated in the Royal Rumble and was eliminated by Booker T when The Undertaker&#x27;s old theme music began playing and distracted him. Over the following weeks, Kane repeatedly insisted that The Undertaker was &quot;dead&quot;, only to be met with various paranormal incidents, such as a rainstorm over the ramp on which he stood. On the March 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane appeared in the ring and saw an empty casket; as he opened it, he saw an urn inside of it. He then grabbed the microphone and stated that it was going to take more than an empty casket and an urn to intimidate him. He then stated that The Undertaker&#x27;s legacy, his 11–0 WrestleMania streak and his life, was coming to an end. He said: &quot;it&#x27;s back to the grave for you for good&quot;. He claimed that it&#x27;s over and that he&#x27;s not afraid of The Undertaker. But, the lights went out, and the 10,000-pound wrestling ring lifted off the ground with Kane standing in it and tilted sideways, which would be the final message sent from The Undertaker before their match at WrestleMania XX.

A rivalry had been simmering for some time between Mick Foley and Randy Orton. On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, following an on-air ceremony honoring Foley for his achievements, Orton and Ric Flair attacked him backstage and threw him down a flight of stairs. Foley returned as the replacement for Steve Austin as Raw co-general manager and gave himself a shot at Orton&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship on the December 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but he walked out of the match and would not face Orton, even after Orton spat on him. On the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, a furious Austin declared that Foley would be entered in the Royal Rumble match and be expected to return and wrestle, which he did by eliminating Orton (and himself) from the match. On the March 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley was later joined by The Rock in the feud, and the re-formed Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection challenged Orton, Batista, and Flair to a handicap tag team match at WrestleMania.

==Event==

===Preliminary matches===

WrestleMania XX began with the Boys Choir of Harlem singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. The first match that aired was a singles match between Big Show and John Cena for the WWE United States Championship, the first time the title was ever defended at the event. The match began with Big Show beating down Cena, who then came back, executing an FU for a near-fall against Big Show. Cena grabbed his signature chain and tried to attack Big Show with it, however, the referee saw the chain and confiscated it due to its being illegal in the match. With the referee distracted, Cena hit Big Show with hidden brass knuckles and executed another FU to win the match and the title.

The next match was a fatal four-way tag team match – involving Rob Van Dam and Booker T, Garrison Cade, and Mark Jindrak, the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), and La Résistance (René Duprée and Rob Conway) – for the World Tag Team Championship. The match saw quick action between all four teams, and ended when Conway was pinned by Van Dam after Booker T performed a scissor kick on him, which was then followed by Van Dam&#x27;s Five-Star Frog Splash, leading to the two retaining the titles.

The third match was between Christian and Chris Jericho. The match centered around both men furiously attacking each other; Christian won the match after Jericho&#x27;s love interest, Trish Stratus, attacked Jericho thinking he was Christian, allowing Christian to roll him up for the win. Following the match, Stratus turned on Jericho and slapped him several times, allowing Christian to perform the Unprettier on Jericho. This was the last match officiated by referee Tim White, who retired after this.

Next up was a handicap match featuring Evolution (Randy Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair) against the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley). Evolution won the match when Orton pinned Foley after executing an RKO.

&quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund then introduced the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2004. This was followed by the inter-promotional Playboy Evening Gown match between the team of Torrie Wilson and Sable against Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, where both teams wore lingerie. Wilson and Sable won after Wilson pinned Jackie with a roll up.

The next match was a Cruiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship. Último Dragón and Shannon Moore started the match, with Dragón getting a pinfall victory after a Dragon-DDT, but was then forced to submit by Jamie Noble, with a Dragon Sleeper, who next eliminated Funaki in 8 seconds. Nunzio was then in the match, but was eliminated after being counted out of the match when he was unable to return to the ring by the referee&#x27;s count of ten. Billy Kidman then entered the match, pinning and eliminating Noble, following a top rope BK-Bomb. Kidman was then pinned and eliminated by Rey Mysterio with a Sunset Flip Powerbomb from the top rope. Tajiri was the next entrant, but was also pinned by Mysterio, following a Victory Roll. Akio was the next scheduled entrant but was unable to compete, due to being inadvertently attacked by Tajiri with his signature green mist that he spat out of his mouth when Mysterio ducked. The Cruiserweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero, was the final entrant; and he pinned Mysterio with a reversal of Mysterio&#x27;s Sunset Flip to win with the assistance of his father Chavo Classic, thus retaining the title. This was the last time in WrestleMania that the Cruiserweight Championship was defended.

The seventh match featured Brock Lesnar and Goldberg, with special guest referee Steve Austin. The beginning of the match began with both men staring each other down, jawing back and forth, with no physical action for several minutes, causing an exasperated Austin at one point to coax them into locking up. The fact that they both were leaving the WWE immediately after the match, as well as the lack of effort brought forth by both Goldberg and Lesnar, drew large heat from the fans throughout the match, with fans chanting, &quot;You sold out&quot;, the chorus of Steam&#x27;s &quot;Na Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;This match sucks&quot;, &quot;We want Bret&quot;, &quot;Boring&quot;, &quot;Goldberg sucks&quot;, and &quot;Hogan&quot;. Goldberg then executed a Spear on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar then executed the F-5 on Goldberg for a near-fall. Afterward, Lesnar tried to use Goldberg&#x27;s signature spear on him and missed, hitting the ring post, allowing Goldberg to execute another spear and a Jackhammer for the victory. After the match, Lesnar responded to the fans&#x27; criticism by gesturing his middle finger, seemingly at the crowd, but which was actually directed towards Vince McMahon, and to Austin. Austin then executed a Stone Cold Stunner on both competitors, to the crowd&#x27;s delight, and celebrated with beer in the ring.

The next match was another four-way tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, involving Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty versus the APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq), the Basham Brothers (Doug Basham and Danny Basham), and the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas). Rikishi and Scotty retained the title after Rikishi pinned Danny with a Banzai Drop.
The ninth match was between Victoria and Molly Holly for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, where Holly would have her hair shaved if she lost. Victoria would counter a Widow&#x27;s peak attempt by Holly into a backslide pin to win the match and retain the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. Holly tried running towards the backstage area to escape the match&#x27;s stipulation, but was eventually stopped by Victoria, who would knock her out and shave her bald.

===Main event matches===
The 10th match of the night was for the WWE Championship, between the champion Eddie Guerrero and the challenger Kurt Angle. The match began with both men maneuvering on the mat. Guerrero then performed a DDT and Frog Splash on Angle that would result in a pin attempt. Angle then recovered and applied an ankle lock, but Guerrero escaped the hold by rolling through it and throwing Angle out of the ring. As Angle was outside, Guerrero loosened his own boot. When Angle returned to the ring, he tried to apply the hold again. This time, Guerrero pushed Angle off with his other foot and allowed his boot to come off and thus break free from Angle&#x27;s hold. With Angle confused, Guerrero pinned Angle with a roll-up with his feet on the ropes to win the match and retain the WWE Championship.

The 11th match of the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, &quot;You&#x27;re not coming back tonight. You&#x27;re not coming back, I buried you alive.&quot; After this, the lights in the arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker&#x27;s former manager and Kane&#x27;s (storyline) father, was heard screaming &quot;Oh, yes!&quot;. Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker&#x27;s former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation at the top of the ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, &quot;My son... You&#x27;re no son of mine.&quot; He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his &quot;Deadman&quot; persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, saying things like &quot;I killed you!&quot;, &quot;I buried you alive!&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re not real!&quot;, while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down; and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, who sat up shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam of his own and a Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remain undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.
The main event was a triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels, and champion Triple H. The match started with Benoit and Michaels wanting to face the champion, but would wrestle each other to try and gain an advantage, before Triple H&#x27;s intervention led to the match going back-and-forth between all three men, performing their signature holds and maneuvers throughout. Benoit soon gained control over Michaels when he applied the Crippler Crossface. As Michaels was about to submit, Triple H saved the match, attacking both men. Triple H and Michaels then teamed up to suplex Benoit through a broadcast table. Triple H performed the Pedigree on Michaels and Benoit broke up a pinfall. Michaels then attempted Sweet Chin Music on Benoit, who countered it by throwing Michaels out of the ring. As this occurred, Triple H again attempted to execute a Pedigree on Benoit, but Benoit countered and applied the Crippler Crossface, with Triple H submitting, making it the first time ever that a WrestleMania main event ended in a submission. As a result, Benoit won the match and the World Heavyweight Championship, crying tears of joy. After the match, Eddie Guerrero came to the ring and the two champions embraced while confetti showered down as the event ended.

==Reception==
WrestleMania XX was met with a generally mixed-to-positive critical reception. Robert Leighty Jr. of &quot;411Mania&quot; gave the event an overall score of 7.3 out of 10.0 and noted that:
This is a very long show with a lot of filler to get as many people as possible involved, but the Main Matches all delivered in some way. The 2 Main Title matches were fantastic, and the handicap match was a blast. You throw in a strong Jericho/Christian match and the unique crowd response of Goldberg/Lesnar and you have a strong WrestleMania. Not the greatest ever thanks to a mediocre run in the middle, but a good show that could have been better.
The triple threat match between Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship received critical acclaim, with many wrestling publications and websites calling this match one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time. Leighty wrote that the main event was, &quot;The greatest three-way match in the history of professional wrestling. Everything was perfect about this match including the finish.&quot; The match was #2 on IGN&#x27;s list of Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History. However, due to the events surrounding the death of Chris Benoit, the match is rarely, if ever, mentioned by the WWE.

John Powell of &quot;Canadian Online Explorer&quot;″s professional wrestling section rated the entire event 4 out of 10 stars, which was a lower rating than he gave to the previous year&#x27;s event. The Triple Threat match between Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship receiving the highest rating of 7.5 out of 10 stars; the match between Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship was rated 7 out of 10 stars; the match between The Undertaker and Kane was rated 2 out of 10 stars; and the match between Bill Goldberg and Brock Lesnar received the lowest rating, 0 out of 10 stars.

The Goldberg–Lesnar match is widely considered one of the worst matches in WrestleMania history. Writing for Bleacher Report, Mike Krakalovich named it the 4th worst match in the history of the event. The match was also inducted into WrestleCrap.

==Aftermath==

Brock Lesnar and Goldberg left the WWE after their event, but both returned to WWE (Lesnar in 2012, Goldberg in 2016) and reignited their rivalry, including feuding for several months on social media and during promotional work for the &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. This would set up a rematch between the two at the 2016 Survivor Series, which Goldberg won in one minute and 26 seconds. After Goldberg entered himself into the 2017 Royal Rumble match the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar&#x27;s advocate Paul Heyman said that Lesnar would also be in the match after being embarrassed at Survivor Series; however, Goldberg eliminated Lesnar. Lesnar challenged Goldberg to a final match at WrestleMania 33 which Goldberg accepted. The match then became a championship match after Goldberg defeated Kevin Owens at Fastlane to win the Universal Championship. At WrestleMania 33, Lesnar defeated Goldberg to win the championship and end the feud.

At Backlash, the original main event match was between Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H appeared to be out of the picture, as the annual WWE Draft Lottery took place eight days after WrestleMania; and he was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Almost immediately after the draft lottery, the dethroned champion was traded back to &quot;Raw&quot;; and on March 29 he demanded that the intended match at Backlash be changed to Benoit and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff liked the idea of the match, but concluded that he had promised Michaels a World title match at Backlash. To solve this, Bischoff booked a return triple threat match to serve as the main event for Backlash. Benoit emerged victorious by submission for the second consecutive pay-per-view, this time forcing Michaels to submit to a Sharpshooter. Benoit went on to hold the title until August 2004, losing it to Randy Orton at SummerSlam.

The feud between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero continued. Angle, however, went in for surgery on his neck shortly after WrestleMania and was not scheduled to return to action for some time. To cover this in storyline, Angle was made the on-screen General Manager of SmackDown! after previous GM Paul Heyman was drafted off the brand and promptly quit rather than work for his hated rival Bischoff. On April 15, Angle&#x27;s legitimate neck problems were further incorporated into the story by having The Big Show chokeslam Angle off a ledge and render him crippled to the point where he could not walk without crutches and required a wheelchair. At The Great American Bash, Guerrero defended his title in a Texas Bull Rope match against John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL). The match ended with Guerrero appearing to have won, but Angle reversed the decision and awarded the match and WWE Championship to JBL.

Shortly after the Bash, Angle interfered in a Guerrero match under the guise of a masked wrestler named &quot;El Gran Luchador&quot;, but was exposed by the former champion. On July 22, 2004, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon confronted Angle, who was still using crutches and the wheelchair, demanding his resignation for faking his handicap. When Angle would not do so, McMahon fired him and began attacking him with one of the crutches. McMahon saw that Angle was completely healthy as he fended off the attack and thus put him back on the active roster and ordered Angle to wrestle Guerrero at SummerSlam. Angle defeated Guerrero after he forced Guerrero to submit to the ankle lock. At Survivor Series their feud finally ended in a Four-on-Four Traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Match, with Guerrero&#x27;s team (composed of Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) being victorious against Team Angle (composed of Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak, and Carlito).

After WrestleMania XX, Trish Stratus teamed with Christian in a losing effort against Chris Jericho in a handicap match at Backlash. Elsewhere in the Divas Division, Victoria retained her WWE Women&#x27;s Championship against Lita at the same event. On the SmackDown side, Sable reverted to her heel persona and engaged in a short feud with Torrie Wilson.

Cactus Jack and Randy Orton continued their feud at Backlash, with Jack challenging Orton to a hardcore match for the Intercontinental Championship. Orton won after performing an RKO to slam Cactus Jack onto a barbed wire baseball bat.

After WrestleMania, Kane and The Undertaker went their separate ways. Before the year was out, both men would receive shots at their respective brands&#x27; top championships. Kane faced Benoit at Bad Blood for the World Heavyweight Championship, while Undertaker received multiple shots at JBL for the WWE Championship, the last of which came at Armageddon in December. Kane spent the rest of his time in a feud with Lita and Matt Hardy, which led to the debut of Gene Snitsky and a feud with him.

<doc id="520522" wikidata="Q1095345" url="?curid=520522" title="Battle of Saint-Mihiel">
<text>The Battle of Saint-Mihiel was a major World War I battle fought from 12 to 15 September 1918, involving the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) and 110,000 French troops under the command of General John J. Pershing of the United States against German positions. The U.S. Army Air Service played a significant role in this action.

This battle marked the first use of the terms &quot;D-Day&quot; and &quot;H-Hour&quot; by the Americans. 

The attack at the Saint-Mihiel salient was part of a plan by Pershing in which he hoped that the Americans would break through the German lines and capture the fortified city of Metz. It was the first large offensive launched mainly by the United States Army in World War I, and the attack caught the Germans in the process of retreating. This meant that their artillery was out of place and the American attack, coming up against disorganized German forces, proved more successful than expected. The Saint-Mihiel attack established the stature of the U.S. Army in the eyes of the French and British forces, and again demonstrated the critical role of artillery during World War I and the difficulty of supplying such massive armies while they were on the move. The U.S. attack faltered as artillery and food supplies were left behind on the muddy roads. The attack on Metz was not realized, as the Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch ordered the American troops to march towards Sedan and Mézières, which would lead to the Meuse–Argonne offensive.

==Background: The Saint-Mihiel salient==
Saint-Mihiel is a town in the Meuse department in northeastern France. After the end of the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War, the town was no longer considered important strategically, and France did not develop military installations. This changed early in World War I, when the town was inside the battlefront.

In 1914, the German command wished to take the Verdun fortifications, which formed a strong point in the French lines. A first attempt, at Bois-le-Pretre (&quot;Priesterwald&quot; in German), failed, despite violent fighting. During two more attempts (Battle of Flirey), German troops took Saint-Mihiel and Fort du Camp-des-Romains, but they were ultimately stopped at Fort de Troyon to the south of Verdun.

During the course of the war, the front did not change much in this area. Saint-Mihiel formed a salient inside the French lines, blocking communications between Nancy and Verdun. The area near St. Mihiel suffered much fighting:
* The &quot;Crête des Éparges&quot; (Les Éparges crest): February–April 1915.
* At the &quot;Bois d&#x27;Ailly&quot; (Ailly Wood) and the &quot;Tranchée de la Soif&quot; (Trench of Thirst): isolated behind German lines, Commander d&#x27;André&#x27;s men fought three days without food or water before surrendering in May 1915.
* At &quot;Bois Brûlé&quot; (The Burned Forest), the French suffered many casualties when German conquered a redoubt in December 1914. It was here that the sub-officer Jacques Péricard pronounced the famous words: &quot;Debout les morts!&quot; (Dead men, arise!) on 8 April 1915.
* The &quot;forêt d&#x27;Apremont&quot; (Apremont forest), the &quot;Tête à vache&quot; (Cow&#x27;s head) trenches, Calonne trenches...
In spite of French attacks, the German forces were able to retain this strategic location until the last months of the war.

==Prelude==
General John Pershing thought that a successful Allied attack in the region of St. Mihiel, Metz, and Verdun would have a significant effect on the German Army. General Pershing was also aware that the area&#x27;s terrain setting first dictated that the restricted rail and road communications into Verdun (restrictions that had been imposed by the German attack during the Battle of Flirey) be cleared, and that a continuation of the attack to capture the Germany railroad center at Metz would be devastating to the Germans. For this, he placed his confidence in a young First Infantry Division Major, George Marshall, to move troops and supplies effectively throughout the battle. After these goals were accomplished, the Americans could launch offensives into Germany proper. The American First Army had been activated in August and taken over the sector of the Allied line. Pershing had to persuade Marshal Foch (the supreme Allied military commander) to permit an American attack on the salient.

===Weather reports===
The weather corps of Corps I Operation Order stated: &quot;Visibility: Heavy driving wind and rain during parts of day and night. Roads: Very muddy.&quot; This would pose a challenge to the Americans when the order to advance was given. In some parts of the road, the men were almost knee-deep in mud and water. After five days of rain, the ground was nearly impassable to both the American tanks and infantry. Many of the tanks were wrecked by water leaking into their engines, while others got stuck in mud flows. Some of the infantrymen developed early stages of trench foot, even before the trenches were dug.

===German defensive positions===

Prior to the American operation, the Germans installed many in-depth series of trenches, wire obstacles, and machine-gun nests. The battlefields&#x27; terrain included the nearby premises of three villages: Vigneulles, Thiaucourt, and Hannonville-sous-les-Cotes. Their capture would accelerate the envelopment of the German divisions near St. Mihiel. The American forces planned to breach the trenches and then advance along the enemy&#x27;s logistical road network.

The Germans knew many details about the Allied offensive campaign coming against them. One Swiss newspaper had published the date, time, and duration of the preparatory barrage. However, the German Army stationed in the area of St. Mihiel lacked sufficient manpower, firepower and effective leadership to launch a counter-attack of its own against the Allies. With Allied offensives to the north, the Germans decided to pull out of the St. Mihiel Salient and consolidate their forces near the Hindenburg Line. The order to evacuate the area was given on 8 September. The Allied forces discovered the information on a written order to Army Group Gallwitz.

===Allied tank support===

Although the AEF was new to the French theater of war, it trained hard for nearly a year in preparation for fighting against the German armies. In June 1917 Pershing ordered the creation of a tank force to support the AEF&#x27;s infantry. As a result, by September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel George S. Patton Jr. had finished training two tank battalions – 144 French-built Renault FT light tanks organized as the 344th and 345th Battalions of the United States Tank Corps – at Langres, France for an upcoming offensive at the St. Mihiel salient. &quot;Due to the serious resistance of the enemy, especially along the eastern edge of the FORET d’ARGONNE and in the vicinity of CHEPPY and VARENNES, and due also the lack of support of the Infantry, all the Tanks had contrary to plan entered the action before evening of the first day. The 344th Battalion left the positions of departure and advanced ahead of the Infantry at H-hour (5:30 a.m.) On the morning of the 26th, Colonel G. S. Patton, Jr., commanding the Brigade of Tanks, was wounded while getting Tanks forward and rallying disorganized Infantrymen to attack enemy resistance. Major Sereno E. Brett, commanding the 344th Battalion, was then placed in command of the Brigade.&quot; Patton was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot; that day. 
In addition to the 144 AEF tanks, the attack was joined by 275 French tanks (216 FTs and 59 Schneider CA1 and Saint-Chamond tanks) of the French 1st Assault Artillery Brigade; a total of 419 tanks.

===Allied air support===

Chief of the United States Army Air Service Mason Patrick oversaw the organization of 28 air squadrons for the battle, with the French, British, and Italians contributing additional units to bring the total force numbers to 701 pursuit planes, 366 observation planes, 323 day bombers, and 91 night bombers. The 1,481 total aircraft made it the largest air operation of the war.
The French Army engaged the newly created Division Aérienne (Air Division), under command of General Duval, with a strength of 717 planes (24 fight squadron / 432 SPAD VII, 15 Close Air Support squadron / 225 BREGUET XIV, 4 reconnaissance squadron / 60 CAUDRON R XI). Five French fighter groups and 3 US Army fighter / bomber groups were also engaged.

==Battle==
The Saint-Mihiel offensive began on 12 September with a threefold assault on the salient. The main attack was made against the south face by two American corps. On the right was the I Corps (from right to left the 82nd, 90th, 5th, and 2nd Divisions in line with the 78th in reserve) covering a front from Pont-à-Mousson on the Moselle west toward Limey; on the left, the IV Corps (from right to left the 89th, 42d, and 1st Divisions in line with the 3rd in reserve) extending along a front from Limey west toward Marvoisin. A secondary thrust was carried out against the west face along the heights of the Meuse, from Mouilly north to Haudimont, by the V Corps (from right to left the 26th Division, the French 15th Colonial Division, and the 8th Brigade, 4th Division in line with the rest of the 4th in reserve). A holding attack against the apex, to keep the enemy in the salient, was made by the French II Colonial Corps (from right to left the French 39th Colonial Division, the French 26th Division, and the French 2nd Cavalry Division in line). In First Army reserve were the American 35th, 80th, and 91st Divisions.

The American V Corps location was at the northwestern vertices, the II French Colonial Corps at the southern apex, and the American IV and I Corps at the southeastern vertices of the salient. Furthermore, General Pershing&#x27;s intent was obvious; to envelop the salient by using the main enveloping thrusts of the attack against the weak vertices. The remaining forces would then advance on a broad front toward Metz. This pincer action, by the IV and V Corps, was to drive the attack into the salient and to link the friendly forces at the French village of Vigneulles, while the II French Colonial Corps kept the remaining Germans tied down. The French II Colonial Corps were successful in the attack on the apex and entered Saint-Mihiel on 15 September 1918, taking 4000 prisoners. They then pushed into the plain of Woëvre up to Haumont-Woël-Doncourt.

The Allies mobilized 1,481 aircraft to provide air superiority and close air support over the front. About 40% were American-flown in American units, the remainder were British, French, and Italian. Nine bomber squadrons of the British RAF, although provided for the battle, were not under Pershing&#x27;s operational control.

Defending the salient was German &quot;Army Detachment C&quot;, consisting of eight divisions and a brigade in the line and about two divisions in reserve. Now desperately short of manpower, they had begun a step-by-step withdrawal from the salient only the day before the offensive began.

Pershing&#x27;s plan had tanks supporting the advancing infantry, with two tank companies interspersed into a depth of at least three lines, and a third tank company in reserve. The result of the detailed planning was an almost unopposed assault into the salient. The American I Corps reached its first day&#x27;s objective before noon, and the second day&#x27;s objective by late afternoon of the second. The attack went so well on 12 September that Pershing ordered a speedup in the offensive. By the morning of 13 September, the 1st Division, advancing from the east, joined up with the 26th Division, moving in from the west, and before evening all objectives in the salient had been captured. At this point, Pershing halted further advances so that American units could be withdrawn for the coming Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

==Aftermath==
One reason for the American forces&#x27; success at St. Mihiel was General Pershing&#x27;s thoroughly detailed operations order. Pershing&#x27;s operation included detailed plans for penetrating the Germans&#x27; trenches, using a combined arms approach to warfare. Another reason was the audacity of the small unit commanders on the battlefield. Unlike other officers who commanded their soldiers from the rear, Colonel George S. Patton and Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur and their subordinates would lead their men from the front lines. They believed that a commander&#x27;s personal control of the situation would help ease the chaos of the battlefield.

American Captain Harry Truman, who commanded Battery D of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment during the battle, later became President of the United States.

==In popular culture==
The Battle of Saint-Mihiel is depicted in the climax of the 1927 film &quot;Wings&quot;.

<text>Cuper&#x27;s Cove, on the southwest shore of Conception Bay on Newfoundland&#x27;s Avalon Peninsula was an early English settlement in the New World, and the third one after Harbour Grace, Newfoundland (1583) and Jamestown, Virginia (1607) to endure for longer than a year. It was established in 1610 by John Guy on behalf of Bristol&#x27;s Society of Merchant Venturers, who had been given a charter by King James I of England to establish a colony on the island of Newfoundland. Most of the settlers left in the 1620s, but apparently a few stayed on and the site was continuously inhabited.

The community is currently known as Cupids.

== Site selection ==
In the early sixteenth century the island of Newfoundland was frequented by seasonal fisherman from many European countries. The competition was tough to be the first to sail to the rich fishing grounds around the island and indeed the rest of North America. The island had some obvious advantages over the rest of North America as a site to establish an English colony. The island was very familiar to fisherman and explorers, especially the bays and coves on the Avalon Peninsula where many would set up temporary shelters as they prosecuted the fishery. The merchants and owners of the vessels that made those trips to Newfoundland had recognized the importance that the strategic location that Newfoundland had placed on establishing a permanent settlement.

Time was ripe for a permanent settlement in Newfoundland. Given the failure of Walter Raleigh to establish a colony at Roanoke Island in 1584 and the successful settlement at Jamestown in 1607 and on learning that Samuel de Champlain had sailed into the St. Lawrence to initiate the settlement of New France, pressure was mounting to lay claim to the resource rich New World. King James was told that the French had made attempts to over-winter in Newfoundland and it was only a matter of time before a successful colony would be established by the French and lay claim to the island.

In 1607 Bristol&#x27;s &quot;Society of Merchant Venturers&quot; which included Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Percival Willoughby and John Slany, had formed the Newfoundland Company with shares selling at £25. The Newfoundland Company had then petitioned the King James I, seeking approval to establish a colony in Newfoundland. John Guy visited the island in 1608 to scout possible locations for a settlement, selecting Cuper&#x27;s Cove as his preferred location. The Privy Council accepted his petition on 2 May 1610 issuing a charter to the Earl of Northampton (Guy&#x27;s patron).

In 1610 John Guy, his brother Phillip, his brother-in-law William Colston and 38 colonists had set sail from Bristol aboard three ships. In August 1610 they made landfall in the area Guy had visited two years earlier to set about building a settlement.

== Site construction (1610—1611)==
John Guy had landed at Cuper&#x27;s Cove in August 1610 and is described in a letter from John Guy to Sir Percival Willoughby from Cuper&#x27;s Cove, 6 October 1610 where it states in part:
The colonists all male were made up of masons, carpenters, blacksmiths and other apprentices to build fortifications and dwellings to prepare for the coming winter. The charter had stipulated that the settlers of Cuper&#x27;s Cove were not to interfere with the operation of the migratory fishery in any way. It wasn&#x27;t deemed a problem, for the Cuper&#x27;s Cove area was not considered prime fishing grounds, but certainly over winter they would have time to prepare for the next year fishing season and they would be the first on those grounds.

Guy and his colonists began clearing the area and by May 1611 the colony consisted of a dwelling house and a store house contained within a . x . enclosure, a second dwelling house, a work house and a forge. Within the confines of the settlement were two saw pits and a wooden defense works upon which three cannons were mounted.

One of the first items of construction was to dig a cellar, which in recent excavations has determined it to be roughly . across with a maximum depth of seven feet, walled-up with flat stone and back-filled with rubble. The dwellings were made of cobble and flagstone floors with some areas covered by wooden timbers and floor boards. The end of the first winter, a mild winter, the report back to England was very optimistic where Guy notes that the months of October and November are both warmer and drier than in England. The livestock they had brought from England had thrived and had added to their numbers.

The colonists built, along with the dwellings and support structures, six fishing vessels and a twelve tonne bark, &quot;Endeavour.&quot; Fortifications were by means of a palisade wall of local cut poles sixteen feet long set upright all around the perimeter of the settlement. The fortress was completed by the summer of 1612 to defend the plantation against the pirate Peter Easton.

== Settlement expansion (1612–1613) ==
The plantation continued development and by 8 September 1612 a dwelling for Henry Crout and his ward Thomas Willoughby had begun. By the spring of 1613 at least sixteen structures were built on the site. Much of the land had been cleared for the planting of crops and to allow livestock to pasture.

John Guy had stayed at the colony during the winter of 1610 to 1611 and had returned to England in the autumn of 1611. Four of the colonists had died during the winter of 1610 to 1611. In the spring of 1612, Guy had returned, this time with more adventurers and livestock. Guy, an alderman and sound churchman, had also brought with him a clergyman, Rev. Erasmus Stourton.

During the winter of 1612 to 1613 sixty-two people were known to be at the plantation. That winter eight deaths were recorded, all apparently from scurvy. There was also a birth recorded, the first English child born in Newfoundland and what is now Canada. The child was born to Nicholas Guy and his wife on 27 March 1613.

== Beothuk contact ==
No mention of the natives of Newfoundland, namely the Beothuk, is made in the petition of the charter of the Newfoundland Company, a fact that had helped speed it through the Privy Council. There was a brief notation in the charter that stated explicitly any contact with natives would be to convert them to Christianity. Guy had assumed that the natives had long since left Conception Bay, but he knew that they lived not far away. One reason for his construction of the bark &quot;Indeavour&quot; was to explore nearby Trinity Bay and to make contact with the Beothuk.

Two failed attempts to make contact with the Beothuk overland (see article on Henry Crout and construction of Crout&#x27;s Way) Guy had readied his bark and one of his newly constructed fishing vessels to set off in search of the Beothuk at Trinity Bay. In October 1612, Guy, Crout and seventeen others set sail in both vessels in search of the Beothuks. They had entered Mount Eagle Bay (Hopeall) on October 22 and two days later they found several Beothuk houses in a place they called &quot;Savage Harbour&quot; located at Dildo Arm. They found a path leading to a freshwater pond that proved to also be a campground for the Beothuk. A modern excavation at this site called Russell&#x27;s Point has yielded many artifacts of this campsite.

John Guy and his party eventually did meet with the Beothuk at a Bull Arm, where they shared gifts and a meal. The Beothuk had lit a fire to express their willingness to trade and they also produced a white flag made from a wolf skin.

== Post colony use ==
Captain John Mason was appointed the new Proprietary Governor of the colony in 1615, but he too grew tired of disputes with fishermen and with the difficulties of the terrain, and abandoned the colony in 1621 for New England.

Patuxet tribesman, Tisquantum (better known as Squanto) was brought here by Sir John Slany in 1617 and worked with Captain John Mason, governor of the Newfoundland Colony. While being here, he encountered a ship&#x27;s captain by the name of Thomas Dermer, who had worked with both Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Smith. After staying for many months at this site, Squanto thought he would be able to return home to the modern-day American state of Massachusetts, but Dermer took him back to London to meet Gorges and ask for permission about the trip to Squanto&#x27;s homeland. He eventually found a ship bounding for his homeland, but later discovered that his tribe had been all wiped out by an unknown disease.

There is some evidence that an unorganized settlement remained here possibly into the eighteenth century before finally being abandoned, although the cove remained a popular location for visiting fishermen. Cuper&#x27;s Cove is now known as the Town of Cupids.

<text>A drum roll (or roll for short) is a technique used by percussionists to produce a sustained sound for the duration of a written note.

== Types ==
=== Snare drum roll ===


A common snare drum roll is the closed roll. The closed concert roll (orchestral roll, buzz roll, or press roll) is performed by creating 3 (or more) equal sounding bounces on each hand alternating right to left, repeatedly and quickly. The aim of a closed roll is to reproduce the effect of a sustained note on an instrument which inherently produces a short, staccato sound. Because a multiple bounce stroke on a drum head loses energy, and volume, with each successive bounce, it is necessary to use special tactics and techniques to mitigate the loss of sound and cause the repeated notes to sound even. This involves the arm, the wrist, and the fingers. One way to mitigate the loss of sound is to overlap the 3rd bounce from one hand with the first bounce of the next in the manner of a Flam Tap, only much faster and smaller. The loud first bounce occurring closer to the quiet 3rd bounce from the preceding hand give the illusion that the bounces have a more even volume.

There are many interpretations of concert rolls and while the variations result in a similar rolling sound, there are subtle audible differences. One major point of differentiation between rolling techniques is between Metered and Unmetered rolls. Metered rolls require the players arms and wrists to play in time with the beat of the music and so a regular subdivision, such as 8th note triplets, 16th notes, or 16th note triplets must be chosen and maintained. The drawback of metered rolls is that the ideal rolling speed (for the player, the room, the sticks, and the instrument) may lie between exact subdivisions, depending on the tempo, and the sound quality may vary by tempo. The benefit is that it makes all the rolls fit neatly into the music in time and is easier to count. Unmetered rolls require the player to perform the best possible sounding roll they can, whether or not the arm movements correspond to the musical tempo. The drawback to this approach is that the player must count the beats of the music independently to, and in complete disregard of, the speed of the roll and the corresponding arm motion. The benefit is that the roll sounds optimal and smooth at any tempo. The metered closed roll should not be confused with the open or measured roll, as described below.

Examples of Drum rudiments that are similar to, or precisely like, a concert closed roll include: 
*American - Multiple Bounce Roll, Triple Stroke Roll, and Crushed Ruff
*German - Druckruf 
*Scotch - Buzz Roll, stroked rolls 5 through 25 (metered closed rolls in Scottish tradition), and Trizzlet 
*Dutch - Ra stroke 
*Mexican - Rau Tau and Redoble 
*Spanish - Redoble de Zumbido 
*Bajoaragonés - Los Rufaos 
*Eporedian (Ivrea, Italy) - Rullo 

The open roll (&quot;double-stroke roll&quot; or &quot;long roll&quot;) is played with double strokes alternating between the left and right hands. Using a forearm stroke for the first and the fingers for the second stroke, the 2 strokes can be made to sound identical. This produces a near-continuous sound when the technique is mastered. In rudimental drumming, open rolls, consisting of double strokes, are often measured out to a specific number of strokes. A 3 stroke roll is the shortest possible open double stroke roll, but is commonly referred to by the specific name &quot;Drag,&quot; &quot;Ruff,&quot; or &quot;Half Drag.&quot; Typically, any roll with an odd number of strokes is played with a single accent and any roll with an even number of strokes is played with 2 accents. This patterns holds for the 5 Stroke, 6 Stroke, 7 Stroke, 9 Stroke, 10 Stroke, 11 Stroke, 13 Stroke, 15 Stroke, and 17 Stroke Rolls of the PAS 40 rudiments. Note that some numbers between 5 and 17 are missing. These additional rolls are possible and are taught in modern hybrid drumming and in older pre-NARD rudimental systems, as well as those from other countries, notably the Basel and Scotch cultures. For example, the 8 Stroke Roll is present in the Moeller Book from 1925 but is lost in later publications. The 4 Stroke, 8 Stroke, 12 Stroke, 14 Stroke, and 16 Stroke are rare but all exist in official published sources. The Scotch Pipe Band style has a rudimental roll up to 25 strokes. This provides the drummer with a consistent set of rolls from 3 to 17 plus the 25, with any other number being an extrapolation from this system.

The snare drum was the standard for military communication from about 1700 to the 1860s, and a list of British army drum calls from 1800 included the long roll as a call to form a square. During the American Civil War the long roll called the troops to assemble and signaled an attack.

Other than the open roll, there are many other rolls and rudiments that sound like rolls when they are played fast enough (like the freehand technique or single paradiddle).

In the table below, lower-case letters represent grace notes (drags, flams etc.) and hyphens represent rests.

Also, the six-stroke roll is often used in snare solo and marching percussion situations and is a favorite for jazz and rock drummers. It has four variations; each note is equal in length and consists of two double strokes (RRLL) and two singles (R L). The strokes are most commonly taught as (RLLRRL).

French and Dutch drumming include several variations on rolls with an uneven number of strokes between the hands. For example, the French &quot;Bâton Melée&quot;, or mixed stick, can be played in repeating combinations of 3: RRL, LLR, RLL, or LRR.

=== Timpani roll ===
Rolls on timpani are almost exclusively single-stroked. Due to the instruments&#x27; resonance, a fairly open roll is usually used, although the exact rate at which a roll is played depends greatly on the acoustic conditions, the size of the drum, the pitch to which is it tuned and the sticks being used. Higher pitches on timpani require a faster roll to maintain a sustained sound; some timpanists choose to use a buzz roll on higher notes at lower volumes; although there is no definite rule, most timpanists who employ this technique do so on a high &quot;G&quot;, and above. In the end, it often comes down to the discretion of the timpanist.

=== Keyboard roll ===
These are similar to the timpani rolls in that they are done nearly the same way and are both single-stroked. Yarn mallets usually can be rolled much more easily on a marimba than plastic ones can be on a xylophone, because the extra reverberation of a marimba will mask the silent gaps between strokes. For this reason, the rolls can be much slower and still effective. But for xylophone and orchestra bells a much swifter roll is required, especially for rubber or plastic mallets. A brass mallet used with orchestra bells will add extra vibration to aid in the smoothing of the sound.

To get these faster rolls, percussionists (keyboard, snare and timpani) all often use the muscles of their fingers instead of those of the wrists. The fingers have a shorter rotation length and can move faster with less effort than the wrist.

=== Fulcrum roll/Gravity roll/Freehand roll ===
The fulcrum roll, or freehand roll, is a roll in which the rim of the drum momentarily replaces the original finger-created fulcrum. Thus is qualifies as a dual-fulcrum or multiple-fulcrum stroke. The initial stroke creates contact with the drum head in a relatively normal manner. Immediately subsequent, at the bottom or end of the down stroke motion, the rim is contacted approximately 1 inch in front of the thumb and forefinger. Contact with the rim rocks the front portion of the stick upwards from the point of contact with the rim. At this moment, the wrist is located just below the rim and the bead is a couple inches above the head. From the bottom of the down-stroke, the hand is then raised for the upstroke. While the hand raises, the bead of the stick is returning toward the head after its bounce off the rim. As the raising hand and falling bead reach the same height, the head is struck for the second time. This creates two beats contacting the drum head out of a single stroke motion of the arm. The precise moment of contact with the rim momentarily creates a new fulcrum at the drum stick&#x27;s physical point of contact with the rim. This is one of the easier and more commonly used forms of a &quot;one handed roll&quot;. When executed with precision, this doubling of contact means 16th notes can be played while the arm only strokes 8th notes, or 32nd notes can be played while stroking only 16th notes. The technique is also known amongst many drummers as the gravity blast, though gravity is not required as the technique can be performed inverted, sideways, or in a gravity free environment.

== Notation ==
A tremolo in percussion indicates a roll on any percussion instrument, whether tuned or untuned. A tremolo is notated using strokes, or slashes, through the stem of a note. In the case of whole notes, the strokes or slashes are drawn above or below the note, where the stem would be if there were one. For the case of a snare drum and some other percussion instruments, rolls may be indicated by individual notes or with the use of tremolos, depending on the sheet music&#x27;s notation.

In percussion, three types of tremolos may be seen in sheet music; a tremolo with a single, double, or triple slash going through the stem:

A single slash indicates a diddle, or two double strokes from a single hand, that subdivides the note in two. &quot;RR or &quot;

A double slash indicates two diddles, or two double strokes from each hand, that subdivides the note in four. &quot;RRLL or LLRR&quot;

A triple slash indicates four diddles, playing two double strokes twice from each hand, that subdivides the note into eight. &quot;RRLLRRLL or LLRRLLRR&quot;

In a 4/4 time signature, a triple slash quarter note would entail playing double strokes for two eighth notes with a single slash each, or four sixteenth notes &quot;RRLL&quot; or &quot;LLRR&quot;. A double slash eighth note would entail playing double strokes for four sixteenth notes &quot;RRLL&quot; or &quot;LLRR.&quot; A single slash sixteenth note would entail playing one pair of double stroke thirty-second notes &quot;RR&quot; or &quot;LL.&quot; In the case of a half note or whole note, it&#x27;s common to play alternating double stroke sixteenth notes for the duration of the note.

Depending on the sheet music, individual notes with labeled sticking patterns can also be rolls. These rolls can be single stroke rolls, double stroke rolls, triple stroke rolls, or any multiple bounce roll variation. Rolls that don&#x27;t use tremolos typically incorporate different articulations and dynamics, &quot;although this is not always the case&quot;.

<text>Norman Walker Porteous (9 September 1898 in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland – 3 September 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland) was a noted theologian and writer on Old Testament issues, and the last surviving military officer of the First World War.

==Education==
Porteous entered the University of Edinburgh as first bursar in 1916, but his studies were interrupted by World War I service in France, where he served as a subaltern in the 13th (Service) Battalion, The Royal Scots.

He graduated from the university with first class honours in Classics in 1922. After time spent studying and teaching in Oxford, St Andrews and Germany, he rejoined the university in 1935 when he was appointed to the Chair of Old Testament Language, Literature and Theology. In 1954, Porteous was president of the Society for Old Testament Study.

==Early career==
In 1937 Porteous was appointed to the Chair of Hebrew and Semitic Languages at the University of Edinburgh. He was Principal of New College and also Dean of the Faculty from 1964 until his retirement in 1968. He had been commissioned into the Edinburgh University Officers&#x27; Training Corps in 1941, but resigned his commission as a Lieutenant in 1945.

==Contributions==
Norman Porteous was one of the panel of translators of the &quot;New English Bible&quot; and latterly Dean of the University of Edinburgh, where he was also Senior &quot;Professor Emeritus&quot;; he may also have been its oldest graduate.

In 1965, Porteous postulated that an anonymous writer wrote the Book of Daniel during the persecution under Antiochus IV Epiphanes. According to this theory the anonymous author attributed events that were witnessed by this writer in the 2nd century BCE to Daniel as prophecies. Paul Roche agreed with Porteous. Since the writer&#x27;s incomplete and erroneous view of historical details in the second half of the sixth century support the theory of a late date of writing. Porteous and Roche agree that the book is composed of folktales used to fortify the Jewish faith during a time of persecution and oppression by the Hellenized Seleucids four centuries after the Babylonian captivity.

==Death==
Porteous died at the age of 104.

<text>The ace of spades (also known as the Spadille, Old Frizzle, and Death Card) is traditionally the highest and most valued card in the deck of playing cards. The actual value of the card varies from game to game.

==Design==
The ornate design of the ace of spades, common in packs today, stems from the 17th century, when James I and later Queen Anne imposed laws requiring the ace of spades to bear an insignia of the printing house. Stamp duty, an idea imported to England by Charles I, was extended to playing cards in 1711 by Queen Anne and lasted until 1960.

Over the years, a number of methods were used to show that duty had been paid. From 1712 onwards, one of the cards in the pack, usually the ace of spades, was marked with a hand stamp. In 1765 hand stamping was replaced by the printing of the official ace of spades by the Stamp Office, incorporating the royal coat of arms. In 1828 the Duty Ace of Spades (known as &quot;Old Frizzle&quot;) was printed to indicate a reduced duty of a shilling had been paid.

One maker of cards was caught in possession of forged aces and the equipment to produce them. This was a capital offence, and the prosecutor Attorney General Spencer Perceval (later to become the prime minister assassinated in 1812) obtained the conviction of Richard Harding, who was hanged in 1805. The association of the ace of spades with death may spring from such events.

The system was changed again in 1862 when official threepenny duty wrappers were introduced and, although the makers were free to use whatever design they wanted, most chose to keep the ornate ace of spades that is popular today. The ace of spades is thus used to show the card manufacturer&#x27;s information.

Since 1882, an annual pack of cards has been produced by the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards at the installation of each Master and, since 1888, a portrait of the Master has appeared at the centre of the ace of spades.

The exact design of the ace card was so important that it eventually became the subject of design patents and trademarking. For example, on 5 December 1882, George G. White was granted U.S. design patent US0D0013473 for his design. His ace design was adorned with male and female figures leaning onto the spade from either side.

==Symbolism==
=== War ===

The ace of spades has been employed on several occasions in the theatre of war. In the First World War, the 12th (Eastern) Division of the British Army used the Ace of spades symbol as their insignia. In the Second World War, the 25th Infantry Division of the Indian Army used an Ace of Spades on a green background as their insignia.

In World War II, the soldiers of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the American 101st Airborne Division were marked with the spades symbol painted on the sides of their helmets. In this capacity, it was used to represent good luck, due to its fortunate connotations in card playing. Following the confusion of a large-scale combat airborne operation, all four card-suits were used for ease of identification of regiments within the airborne division. Battalions within the regiments were denoted with tic marks or dots, struck from top clockwise: headquarters at the twelve o&#x27;clock position, 1st Battalion at the three o&#x27;clock, etc.

During the Vietnam War, the ace of spades was used as a tool of psychological warfare as it was common practice by US soldiers to leave the ace card on the bodies of killed Vietnamese. They thought that the card&#x27;s connections to French colonial rule of Vietnam and putative symbolism in Vietnamese tradition to mean death and ill-fortune would frighten and demoralise Viet Cong soldiers. This custom was said to be so common that the United States Playing Card Company was asked by Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment to supply crates of that single card in bulk. The plain white tuck cases were marked &quot;Bicycle Secret Weapon&quot;, and the cards were deliberately scattered in villages and in the jungle during raids. The ace of spades, while not a symbol of superstitious fear to the Viet Cong forces, did help the morale of American soldiers. Some U.S. soldiers and Marines were reportedly sticking this card in their helmet band as a sort of anti-peace sign.

=== Other ===
The ace of spades is a symbol for people who are asexual and aromantic. People who are asexual, but not aromantic, use the ace of hearts as a symbol.

==Idioms==
Various idioms involving the ace of spades include &quot;black as the ace of spades,&quot; which may refer either to completely black; totally without light or colour, colour, race, (lack of) morality, or (lack of) cleanliness in a person. 

The French expression &quot;fagoté comme l&#x27;as de pique&quot; translates to &quot;(badly) dressed like the ace of spades.&quot;

==Encoding==
The ace of spades is encoded into Unicode with the code point U+1F0A1, as part of the playing cards Unicode block.

<text>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, ) is the United States federal agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. NIOSH is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Despite its name, it is not part of either the National Institutes of Health nor OSHA. Its current director is John Howard.

NIOSH is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with research laboratories and offices in Cincinnati, Ohio; Morgantown, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Denver, Colorado; Anchorage, Alaska; Spokane, Washington; and Atlanta, Georgia. NIOSH is a professionally diverse organization with a staff of 1,200 people representing a wide range of disciplines including epidemiology, medicine, industrial hygiene, safety, psychology, engineering, chemistry, and statistics.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act, signed by President Richard M. Nixon on December 29, 1970, created NIOSH out of the preexisting Division of Industrial Hygiene founded in 1914. NIOSH was established to help ensure safe and healthful working conditions by providing research, information, education, and training in the field of occupational safety and health. NIOSH provides national and world leadership to prevent work-related illness, injury, disability, and death by gathering information, conducting scientific research, and translating the knowledge gained into products and services. Although NIOSH and OSHA were established by the same Act of Congress, the two agencies have distinct and separate responsibilities. NIOSH has several &quot;virtual centers&quot; through which researchers at its geographically dispersed locations are linked by shared computer networks and other technologies that stimulates collaboration and helps overcome the challenges of working as a team across distances.

==Authority==

Unlike its counterpart, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, NIOSH&#x27;s authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act [29 CFR § 671] is to &quot;develop recommendations for health and safety standards&quot;, to &quot;develop information on safe levels of exposure to toxic materials and harmful physical agents and substances&quot;, and to &quot;conduct research on new safety and health problems&quot;. NIOSH may also &quot;conduct on-site investigations (Health Hazard Evaluations) to determine the toxicity of materials used in workplaces&quot; and &quot;fund research by other agencies or private organizations through grants, contracts, and other arrangements&quot;.

Also, pursuant to its authority granted to it by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, NIOSH may &quot;develop recommendations for mine health standards for the Mine Safety and Health Administration&quot;, &quot;administer a medical surveillance program for miners, including chest X‑rays to detect pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) in coal miners&quot;, &quot;conduct on-site investigations in mines similar to those authorized for general industry under the Occupational Safety and Health Act; and &quot;test and certify personal protective equipment and hazard-measurement instruments&quot;.

=== Respirators ===
Under 42 CFR 84, NIOSH has the right to issue and revoke certifications for respirators, such as the N95. Currently, NIOSH is the only body authorized to regulate respirators, and has trademark rights to the NIOSH air filtration ratings.

==Products and publications==

NIOSH research covers a wide range of fields. The knowledge obtained through intramural and extramural research programs is used to develop products and publication offering innovative solutions for a wide range of work settings. Some of the publications produced by NIOSH include:
* &quot;Alerts&quot; are put out by the agency to request assistance in preventing, solving, and controlling newly identified occupational hazards. They briefly present what is known about the risk for occupational injury, illness, and death.
* &quot;Criteria Documents&quot; contain recommendations for the prevention of occupational diseases and injuries. These documents are submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Mine Safety and Health Administration for consideration in their formulation of legally binding safety and health standards.
* &quot;Current Intelligence Bulletins&quot; analyze new information about occupational health and safety hazards.
* The &quot;National Agricultural Safety Database&quot; contains citations and summaries of scholarly journal articles and reports about agricultural health and safety.
* The Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation program publishes occupational fatality data that are used to publish fatality reports by specific sectors of industry and types of fatal incidents.
* The Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program investigates the causes of &quot;specifically&quot; firefighter deaths on the job.
* The &quot;NIOSH Power Tools Database&quot; contains sound power levels, sound pressure levels, and vibrations data for a variety of common power tools that have been tested by NIOSH researchers.
* The &quot;NIOSH Hearing Protection Device Compendium&quot; contains attenuation information and features for commercially available earplugs, earmuffs and semi-aural insert devices (canal caps).
* &quot;NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods&quot; contains recommendations for collection, sampling and analysis of contaminants in the workplace and industrial hygiene samples, including air filters, biological fluids, wipes and bulks for occupationally relevant analytes.
* The &quot;NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards&quot; informs workers, employers, and occupational health professionals about workplace chemicals and their hazards.

===National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory===

The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) is a research center within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, devoted to research on personal protective equipment (PPE). The NPPTL was created in 2001 at the request of the U.S. Congress, in response to a recognized need for improved research in PPE technologies. It focuses on experimentation and recommendations for respirator masks, by ensuring a level of standard filter efficiency, and develops criteria for testing and developing PPE.

The laboratory conducts research and provides recommendations for other types of PPE, including protective clothing, gloves, eye protection, headwear, hearing protection, chemical sensors, and communication devices for safe deployment of emergency workers. It also maintains certification for N95 respirators, and hosts an annual education day for N95 education. Its emergency response research is part of a collaboration with the National Fire Protection Association.

In the 2010s, the NPPTL has focused on pandemic influenza preparedness, CBRNE incidents, miner PPE, and nanotechnology.

==== NIOSH Certified Equipment List ====
NPPTL is the designated publisher of the NIOSH Certified Equipment List, or CEL. The CEL is a public domain database that details the respirators currently approved by NIOSH, and is ordered separated based on type of respirator, which is designated with a schedule (e.g. TC-84A). 

The CEL was initially released in paper form on September 30, 1993. However, due to low usage of the paper CEL, as well as the increasing number of respirators approved by NIOSH, a Microsoft Access-based version of the CEL was released. Initial releases of the CEL had hose and pressure information for air-line respirators. This information had been eliminated due to concerns over users prioritizing the CEL over respirator documentation.

== Certifications ==
=== B Reader Program ===

In addition to funding publications to help promote and enforce occupational safety, NIOSH also certifies physicians qualified to read radiographic images of various occupational diseases, such as diseases caused by silica, asbestos, and coal dust. A list of B Readers can be found on the NIOSH website for the program.

B Reader testimony has been used extensively in mesothelioma personal injury lawsuits.

== Education and Research Centers ==

NIOSH Education and Research Centers are multidisciplinary centers supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for education and research in the field of occupational health. Through the centers, NIOSH supports academic degree programs and research opportunities, as well as continuing education for OSH professionals. The ERCs, distributed in regions across the United States, establish academic, labor, and industry research partnerships. The research conducted at the centers is related to the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) established by NIOSH.

Founded in 1977, NIOSH ERCs are responsible for nearly half of post-baccalaureate graduates entering occupational health and safety fields. The ERCs focus on industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational medicine, occupational safety, and other areas of specialization. At many ERCs, students in specific disciplines have their tuition paid in full and receive additional stipend money. ERCs provide a benefit to local businesses by offering reduced price assessments to local businesses.
== History ==

=== Establishment ===
NIOSH&#x27;s earliest predecessor was the U.S. Public Health Service Office of Industrial Hygiene and Sanitation, established in 1914. It went through several name changes, most notably becoming the Division of Industrial Hygiene and later the Division of Occupational Health. Its headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. in 1918, and field stations in Salt Lake City in 1949, and in Cincinnati in 1950.

NIOSH was created by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and began operating in May 1971. It was originally part of the Health Services and Mental Health Administration, and was transferred into what was then called the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in 1973. NIOSH&#x27;s initial headquarters were located in Rockville, Maryland.

Prior to 1976, NIOSH&#x27;s Cincinnati operations occupied space at three locations in Downtown Cincinnati, and rented space at 5555 Ridge Avenue in the Pleasant Ridge neighborhood. In 1976, staff at the Downtown locations were relocated to the Robert A. Taft Center in the Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood, which the Environmental Protection Agency was vacating to occupy the new Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center elsewhere in Cincinnati. The Taft Center had opened in 1954 for the PHS as the Robert A. Taft Sanitary Engineering Center, named for the then-recently deceased Senator Robert A. Taft, and the center had become part of the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.

The 5555 Ridge Avenue building had been constructed during 1952–1954 and was initially the headquarters and manufacturing plant of Disabled American Veterans. PHS had leased space in the 5555 Ridge Avenue building beginning in 1962. By 1973 the entire building was leased by the federal government, and in 1982 it was purchased outright by the PHS. In 1987 it was renamed the Alice Hamilton Laboratory for Occupational Safety and Health, after occupational health pioneer Alice Hamilton.

The Appalachian Laboratory for Occupational Respiratory Diseases, which had been created within the PHS in 1967 to focus on black lung disease research, was incorporated into NIOSH, and its building in Morgantown, West Virginia was opened in 1971. NIOSH also continued to operate its Salt Lake City facility.

=== Later history ===

In 1981, the headquarters was moved from Rockville to Atlanta to co-locate with CDC headquarters. The headquarters moved back to Washington, D.C. in 1994, though offices were maintained in Atlanta.

When the U.S. Bureau of Mines was closed in 1996, its research activities were transferred to NIOSH along with two facilities in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bruceton, Pennsylvania, and in Spokane, Washington. The Pittsburgh campus dated from the beginning of the Bureau of Mines in 1910, and contained the historic Experimental Mine and Mine Roof Simulator, while the Spokane facility dated from 1951. NIOSH preserved the administrative independence of these activities by placing them in the new Office of Mine Safety and Health Research.

In 1977, NIOSH had ten regional offices throughout the country. These were closed over time, and by 1989 there were regional offices only in Denver and Boston. The Alaska Field Station in Anchorage, Alaska was established in 1991 in response to the state having the highest work-related fatality rate, with Senator Ted Stevens playing a role in its establishment. It later become known as the Alaska Pacific Regional Office, and in 2015, the Denver, Anchorage, and non-mining Spokane staff joined into the Western States Division.

In 1996, a large addition was built to the Morgantown facility containing safety engineering and bench laboratories. In 2015, funding was approved for a new facility in Cincinnati to replace the Taft and Hamilton buildings, which were considered to be obsolete. A location for the new facility in the Avondale neighborhood was announced in 2017, and proposals from architectural and engineering firms were solicited in 2019.

=== Directors ===
The following people were Director of NIOSH:
* Marcus Key (1971–1975)
* John Finklea (1975–1978)
* Anthony Robbins (1978–1981)
* J. Donald Millar (1981–1993)
* Richard Lemen (Acting 1993–1994)
* Linda Rosenstock (1994–2000)
* &quot;Lawrence J. Fine (acting, 2000–2001)&quot;
* &quot;Kathleen Rest (acting, 2001–2002)&quot;
* John Howard (2002–2008; 2009–present)
* &quot;Christine Branche (acting, 2008–2009)&quot;

=== Other history ===
In 2001, NIOSH was called upon to help clean up Capitol Hill buildings after the 2001 anthrax attacks.

<text>Santiago del Estero (), also known simply as Santiago, is a province in the north of Argentina. Neighboring provinces, clockwise from the north, are Salta, Chaco, Santa Fe, Córdoba, Catamarca and Tucumán.

==History==

The indigenous inhabitants of these lands were the Juríes-Tonocotés, Sanavirones and other tribes. Santiago del Estero is home to about 100,000 speakers of the local variety of Quechua, making this the southernmost outpost of the language of the Incas. When the language reached the area, and how, remains unclear—it may even have arrived only with the native troops that accompanied the first Spanish expeditions.

Diego de Rojas first reached this land in 1542. Francisco de Aguirre founded the city of Santiago del Estero in 1553 as the northernmost city founded by Spanish conquistadores coming from the Pacific Ocean.

Santiago then passed under different governments, from the intendency of Tucumán to the &quot;Audiencia de Charcas&quot;, then again to Tucumán, of which it was later to be designated capital.

However, the bishop moved to Córdoba in 1699 and the government moved to Salta two years later. Furthermore, the silver route between Buenos Aires and the Viceroyalty of Peru passed through Tucumán rather than through Santiago. The combination of these circumstances drastically reduced the importance of the city and the territory and, by the beginning of the 19th century, the city had barely 5,000 inhabitants.

With the creation of the intendency of Salta, Santiago del Estero was transferred to the new intendency of Tucumán. In the middle of the national conflict, Santiago del Estero separated from Tucumán in 1820, coming under the control of pro-autonomy Governor Juan Felipe Ibarra. Among the new province&#x27;s most effective advocates during its early decades was Amancio Jacinto Alcorta, a young composer of sacral music who, representing his province from 1826 to 1862, helped modernize commerce and its taxation in the unstable young nation and promoted domestic banking and credit. In 1856 the provincial constitution was formulated.

At the beginning of the 20th century Santiago del Estero acquired part of the lands that were the subject of a dispute with Chaco Province. By then the province had four cities and 35,000 inhabitants, most of whom lived in precarious conditions. The construction of the &quot;Los Quiroga&quot; dam in 1950 enabled the productivity of the otherwise arid land to be increased by irrigation.

During the 1890s, national policy makers were made aware of a little-publicized tourist route northwest of the city of Santiago del Estero, whereby, despite the abject lack of transportation or lodging amenities, a steady stream of visitors rode on horseback over craggy terrain for hours for the sake of enjoying a cluster of mineral springs rarely mentioned since Spaniards had first noticed them in 1543.

The Argentine Department of Agriculture commissioned University of Buenos Aires chemistry professor Hercules Corti to study the springs. Completing his report in 1918, Corti stated that the Río Hondo Hot Springs were among the most therapeutic on earth and, coming at a time when mineral springs were becoming a leading destination for health tourism, Río Hondo quickly began attracting visitors from all over Argentina. Set aside as a public resort in 1932, the first formal hotel facilities were opened in the late 1940s.
In 1948, the province elected Peronist activist Carlos Arturo Juárez Governor of the province. Santiago del Estero&#x27;s central political figure during the late 20th century, Juárez was energetic and ambitious, and he soon became indispensable to local politics (mostly by proxy). Regarded as a &quot;Caudillo&quot;, by the 1990s, he was readily ordering his opponents&#x27; deaths, including those of former Governor César Iturre in 1996 and of Bishop Gerardo Sueldo in 1998.

The deaths of two local young women, however, exposed Juárez&#x27;s assassin, Antonio Musa Azar, and, faced with undeniable links to Musa Azar&#x27;s litany of past murders and extortions, Juárez resigned in late 2002. His wife, Nina Aragonés de Juárez, was hand-picked to replace him; she was herself removed from office by the order of President Néstor Kirchner in March 2004.

==Geography==

The province is located almost completely in the flat lands of the Gran Chaco, with some depressions. In these depressions lagoons have formed, mainly at &quot;Bañado de Figueroa&quot;, &quot;Bañado de Añatuya&quot;, and those near the basin of the Salado and Dulce Rivers. The Sumampa and Ambargasta sierras are the result of the influence of the Pampas at the southwest.

The soil, rich in lime and salt, is arid and characterised by semi-deserts and steppes. The predominant weather is sub-tropical with a dry season and high temperatures during the entire year; the annual average is 21.5 °C, increased to 24 °C in the latest years, with maxima of up to 50 °C, with visible increases in temperature since 1970. Surprisingly, the maximum was of 38 °C before 1910; and minima of -5 °C, which has increased to -2 °C. The dry season, during the winter, receives an average of 120 mm of precipitation, but the annual average is 700 mm.

== Demographics==


According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Santiago del Estero has 1,054,028 inhabitants.

Historical evolution of the population of the province:
== Economy ==
The province&#x27;s economy, like most in northern Argentina, is relatively underproductive and, still, totalled an estimated US$2.863 billion in 2006; its per capita output, US$3,559, was the nation&#x27;s lowest and a full 60% below the average. Santiago del Estero had long been very rural and fairly agricultural (known for its excellent cotton and tobacco, as well as leather) and nearly lacking in manufacturing; despite this, the humble province has grown just as quickly as many of its better-positioned fellow provinces, in the recovery that Argentina has enjoyed since 2002.

The economy of the province still leans toward primary production, specially in agriculture, about 12% of the province&#x27;s output. Centred on the basins of the Salado and Dulce Rivers, the main crops include cotton (20% of the national production), soybean, maize and onion.

Cattle farming is also important, mainly in the east, where weather conditions make it possible, but goats, with 15% of the national production, adapt better to the rest of the province.

The wood industry of quebracho and algarrobo has also added implanted species totaling an annual average of over 300 thousand tons, of which around 100,000 tons are used for timber and the rest for firewood and vegetal coal.

There is little mining but in the salt flats in the southwest. Manufacturing (less than 10% of output) consists of small industrial enterprises centred mainly on food, textiles and leather.

Tourism is somewhat developed, but only around the main tourist attractions. Tourists visit Santiago del Estero (the oldest city in Argentina) and its historical buildings and museums, Termas de Río Hondo and the Río Hondo hot springs with its 200 hotels, and the &quot;Frontal&quot; dam where water sports are practiced.

The province is home to the Copo National Park, and four protected areas: &quot;Bañados de Figueroa&quot;, &quot;Sierras de Ambargasta&quot;, &quot;Sierra de Guasayan&quot; and &quot;Sierras de Sumampa&quot;.

==Culture==

Important figures connected to the history of Santiago del Estero include colonel Juan Francisco Borges, leader of the Independence War (and ancestor of writer Jorge Luis Borges), as well as the revolutionary leaders Mario Roberto and Francisco René Santucho, founders of the Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores and the Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo.

Among the province&#x27;s most distinguished cultural figures since the 19th century have been painters Felipe Taboada, Ramon Gómez Cornet, Carlos Sánchez Gramajo, Alfredo Gogna, and Ricardo and Rafael Touriño, as well as writers Jorge Washington Ábalos, Bernardo Canal Feijóo, Clementina Rosa Quenel and Julio Carreras (h). Amancio Jacinto Alcorta, a celebrated composer of flute concertos and religious music, also represented Santiago del Estero in Congress through much of the mid-19th century with distinction.

Santiago del Estero&#x27;s musical heritage is one of its most important cultural aspects, with typical folklore chacarera and zamba. Renowned artists and groups include the Manseros Santiagueños, Alfredo Ábalos, Leo Dan, Jacinto Piedra and Raly Barrionuevo. The province&#x27;s best-known folk music ensemble is probably the Ábalos Brothers, active in the genre since 1945 and recording since 1952. The group were among the best-known folk musicians in Argentina.

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Santiago del Estero Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Santiago del Estero Provincial Police.

===Crime and human rights violations===

Santiago del Estero is a province known for the interference of organized crime and the high number of usurpations generated since Gerardo Zamora came to power in 2005, where peasants and landowners are threatened and stripped of them. There are several complaints in which criminal groups, protected from power, are dedicated to usurping land from their legitimate owners. At the end of 2022, one of the many cases of victims of usurpation, where the conjunction of criminal groups and power was observed, was that of Manuel Ascencio Ardiles, who was stripped of 30 hectares of land by the President of the Superior Court of Justice. from Santiago del Estero, Federico López Alzogaray. The case was even known by the Interamerican Institute for Democracy, an international NGO.

Santiago del Estero is a province also known for the violations of Human Rights suffered by its inhabitants, to the point that in 2022 a report was presented to the High Commissioner for Human Rights that exposes the threats to citizens, criminal networks linked to the governor Gerardo Zamora, public officials and their families. Of the many cases of murders related to power in the province, there are two that have been emblematic: The first, the dismemberment and murder of an official who denounced a very serious case of corruption in the Santiago del Estero Revenue Department. And the second case, the rape and dismemberment of a child as revenge for a drug trafficking complaint involving the governor Gerardo Zamora. To all this is added the opacity in the management of the finances of the province.
The murders, usurpations and violence that are experienced in the province are only the reflection of a well-structured drug-criminal network, with ties to the governor, the police, judges and prosecutors, this was confirmed by the consultant Douglas Farah in his report published in November of the year 2022, entitled &quot;Case Study In Transnational Criminal Convergence: Santiago del Estero, Argentina&quot;.

==Political division==
The province is divided into 27 departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;).

<text>The Invincible Province of Santa Fe (, , lit. &quot;Holy Faith&quot;) is a province of Argentina, located in the center-east of the country. Neighboring provinces are from the north clockwise Chaco (divided by the 28th parallel south), Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Santiago del Estero. Together with Córdoba and Entre Ríos, the province is part of the economico-political association known as the Center Region.

Santa Fe&#x27;s most important cities are Rosario (population 1,193,605), the capital Santa Fe (369,000), Rafaela (100,000), Reconquista (99,000) Villa Gobernador Gálvez (74,000), Venado Tuerto (69,000), and Santo Tomé (58,000).

==Demonym==
Citizens of the province are known as &quot;santafesinos&quot; (fem. &quot;santafesinas&quot;).

== History ==
The aboriginal tribes who inhabited this region were the Tobas, Timbúes, Mocovíes, Pilagás, Guaycurúes, and Guaraníes. They were nomadic, lived from hunting, fishing and fruit recollection.

The first European settlement was established in 1527, at the confluence of the Paraná and Carcarañá rivers, when Sebastian Cabot, on his way to the north, founded a fort named Sancti Spiritus, which was destroyed two years later by the natives.

In 1573 Juan de Garay founded the city of Santa Fe in the surroundings of present town Cayastá, but the city was moved in 1651 and 1660 to its present location.

In 1812 the lawyer and general Manuel Belgrano created and displayed for the first time the Argentine flag on the banks of the Paraná River, at Rosario (by that time a small village), south of Santa Fe.

In 1815, while Alvear&#x27;s central government fell due to Ignacio Álvarez Thomas&#x27; rebellion (at that time commander of an army sent to Santa Fe against Artigas), Francisco Candioti, the local militia chief, took over the government peacefully, thus starting the era of Santa Fe as an autonomous province. This period was short lived, since that same year Candioti died and central government reestablished the dependent government. However, in 1816, the &quot;caudillos&quot; Mariano Vera and Estanislao López deposed the governor delegate and proclaimed the sovereignty of the province and its membership into Artigas&#x27;s Free Peoples League (&quot;Liga de Pueblos Libres&quot;).

López drew, in 1818, a provincial constitution of a strongly conservative flavour, after rejecting a project proposed by a provincial assembly; Santa Fe was the first province to have its constitution. During the civil strifes of 1820, Santa Fe troops were decisive in the defeat of Buenos Aires&#x27; centralist army. So, in time, López gradually became the &quot;Federation&#x27;s Patriarch&quot;, establishing himself as the central figure of the Federal Party until his death in 1838.

After López&#x27;s death, his secretary and right-hand man José María Cullen was elected governor. However, Cullen being a potential rival of Buenos Aires governor and Confederation&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Representative, Juan Manuel de Rosas, he sought and obtained Cullen&#x27;s capture and execution, naming the pro-Rosas Juan Pablo López as governor. The new governor remained in power, alternating with Pascual Echagüe, until the province&#x27;s invasion by Justo José de Urquiza&#x27;s Great Army in 1851, and during his term the province adopted a new constitution in 1841.

After the organization of the nation, the province entered an era of peace and prosperity; in 1872 the railways already connected many points of the province, as well as the telegraph lines, and in 1889 the Provincial University of Santa Fe was founded.

The political hegemony of the conservative groups was challenged by the new ideas brought by the European immigrants, giving birth to the Radical Civic Union (UCR) and the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP), and the creation of the Argentine Agrarian Federation. These two parties had many strong electoral contests with the province&#x27;s conservative parties.

After the Electoral Reform of Roque Sáenz Peña in 1912, the UCR reached the government and stayed until the coup of 1930. During this time, more precisely in 1919, the National University of the Littoral was founded. In 1932 it was the PDP who got the governor&#x27;s seat.

The contentious 1958 elections (from which Peronist candidates were barred) brought an ally of President-elect Arturo Frondizi to power in Santa Fe, Dr. Carlos Sylvestre Begnis. Gov. Begnis quickly steered budgets into sorely needed public works, most notably the construction of the Hernandarias Tunnel, a -long connection between the city of Santa Fe and neighboring Paraná. The tunnel, most of which runs under the massive Paraná River, is the longest in Argentina.

Forced to resign after conservative pressure drove President Frondizi from office in 1962, Begnis had the satisfaction of seeing &quot;Hernandarias&quot; open in 1969, and voters overwhelmingly return him to office in 1973 (this time as a Peronist).

Santa Fe suffered the violence of the late &#x27;70s and the depression of the 1980s more than most other provinces. It continued to languish economically during the prosperous 1990s, as the revalued Argentine peso put pressure on its productive sectors. Touching bottom around 2002, its economy has grown by 7% a year since then. The heart of Argentina&#x27;s lucrative soy harvest, the province&#x27;s importance has continued to grow, now rivaling Buenos Aires Province as the nation&#x27;s leading agricultural producer, with Rosario as one of the most important ports in Argentina.

Most of the province consists of green flatlands, part of the humid Pampas, bordering to the north with the Gran Chaco region. There are low sierras to the west. The north has higher temperatures, with an annual average of and precipitations of up to in the east, decreasing towards the west, where there is a distinctive dry season during the winter. The south presents lower temperatures, averaging , and slightly less precipitations.
Summers are hot and humid throughout the province, with average highs ranging from 30 °C (86F) in the south to 34 °C (93F) in the northwest corner, and night temperatures between 17 °C (63F) in the south and 21 °C (70F) in the north. Thunderstorms are common, and so are heat waves what can bring temperatures up to 40 °C (104F) and hot muggy nights. These are often interrupted by cold fronts that bring crisp, cool weather from the south.
March brings cooler nights in the south, and April brings comfortable weather, with highs ranging from 22 °C (72F) in the south to 26 °C (79F) in the north, and lows from 10 °C (50F) to 15 °C (59F). Frost arrives in May in the south, where it occurs frequently until September; in the extreme north, frost is much more sporadic: some years might bring frosty May days, on other years it may come in July, but generally speaking there will always be a few frosty days every year even in the extreme north.
Winter is drier in the west of the province and wetter in the east. In the south, temperatures range from 15 °C (59F) in the day to 4 °C (39F) at night, whereas in the north, from 21 °C (70F) to 9 °C (48F). Cold waves often bring temperatures of -5 °C (23F) in the south, with extremes of -8 °C (18F) recorded; further north, the thermometer descends occasionally to -2 °C (28F) and very rarely to -5 °C (23F). There are often short warm periods of up to 30 °C (86F) during the winter, followed by much colder weather with drizzle and temperatures around 6 °C (43F). Spring starts as soon as the end of August in the north, with very warm weather already present by early October; in the south, nights remain cool until most of November. Generally speaking, spring is unpredictable, with heat waves followed by extended periods of cool weather, as well as dry spells followed by severe thunderstorms.

Rainfall ranges from 1,200 mm (47 in) in the northeast to 800 mm (31 in) in the southwest and extreme northwest. Snowfall is unprecedented in the northern two-thirds of the province, and very rare in the south, where the last occurrence was in 2007 with several centimeters accumulated.
This humid, temperate climate explains why Central and Southern Santa Fe are among the nation&#x27;s richest agricultural regions, with crops such as maize and soybeans popular, and a very well developed dairy industry.

The main river, and connection to open sea through the Río de la Plata is the Paraná River. There are also other tributaries to the Paraná including the Salado del Norte, the Carcarañá and the Arroyo del Medio. The plain lands tend to be flooded after heavy rains due to the growth of the Paraná and Salado rivers. In 2003 a rapid rise of the Salado produced a catastrophic flood of the capital and many communities in the north-center of the province, prompting the evacuation of no fewer than 100,000 people and major economic losses. In 2007, several days of heavy rainfall flooded more than 60 towns in the center and south of the province, including sections of Santa Fe and Rosario, causing tens of thousands of people to be evacuated, crop losses, and widespread damage to the physical infrastructure of the area.

== Economy ==
Santa Fe&#x27;s economy is the fourth most important in the country, having been displaced from third place by neighboring Córdoba Province around 1970. Accounting for 8% of the Argentine total, its output was estimated at US$27 billion in 2006 (which shall be around US$43 billion in 2011 according to Argentina&#x27;s economical growing), or, US$9,000 per capita (around US$13,000 in 2011), somewhat above the national average. Though the economy is well-diversified, agriculture continues to play an indispensable role through its profitability and foreign exchange earnings via exports. Twenty-one percent of the cultivated lands of Argentina are in Santa Fe, whose main crops are soybean (main national producer), sunflower, maize, wheat, and rice. In smaller scale strawberry, honey and derivatives (300,000 beehives), wood, and cotton are produced.

The green grass of the province is ideal for the 6.5 million head of cattle (20% of national stock), which is not only source of meat but of 2.6 billion of liters of milk per year (40% of the national production), which is processed by over 5,000 dairies.

The ports between Rosario and San Lorenzo are departure points for the export of the production of the Santa Fe and many other provinces; through them leave 65% of the Argentine cereal and 55% of the country&#x27;s exports. In 2004, Santa Fe&#x27;s exports (US$7,170 million) accounted for 21% of the national total. Between 2001 and 2004 they increased 65.2%. Derivates of soybean, flours and vegetable oils comprised over US$2 billion and over 7.6 million tonnes. In 2005 the ports of southern Santa Fe shipped 60% of the grains, 93% of the agricultural subproducts and 85% of the vegetable oils exported by Argentina.

Manufacturing in Santa Fe represents 18% of its economy and is also among the top in Argentina. Mills that produce different flours and oils, beer, and other food industries, leather and textiles, hydrocarbon refineries, steel (1 million tonnes a year) and metals production, industrial and agricultural machines, car industry and others.

The services sector is well-developed and very diversified, relying little on tourism or the public sector. Tourism is not an important activity in spite of the wide range of hotels and restaurants. Rosario, home to the National Flag Memorial (&quot;Monumento Nacional a la Bandera&quot;) and a number of museums, receives a number of visitors from Argentina. The replica of the Sancti Spiritus Fort, the ruins of Cayastá and the city of Santa Fe are also common destinations.

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a governor, popularly elected for non-reelegible four-year terms, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative, formed by a bicameral legislature (a 50-member Chamber of Deputies and a 19-member Senate, all elected for four-year terms); and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court and completed by several inferior tribunals.

The Constitution of Santa Fe Province forms the formal law of the province.

From 1991, the executive and legislative officials were elected in single-round elections by a controversial system known as the &quot;Ley de Lemas&quot;. This system was abolished in 2004; the new one includes compulsory primary elections, which were held for the first time in August 2005, with good results according to most analysis. The parliamentary elections of 23 October 2005 were the first main elections to be held after the abolition of the &quot;Ley de Lemas&quot;.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Santa Fe Provincial Police.

== Demographics ==


According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Santa Fe has 3,556,522 inhabitants.
The origin of the population is majority European, descended from the great wave of immigration from 1850 to 1950, being Italians (mainly from Piedmont), Spanish, Swiss and Germans the main ethnic groups in the province. Since 1970, Rosario has been chosen by internal migrants, mainly from the north of Santa Fe and the northern provinces. A smaller minority of the population (20%) are Mestizos and an even lesser number (2-4%) are of full Amerindian descent.

== Administrative division ==
The province is divided into 19 departments (in Spanish, &quot;departamentos&quot;), and the departments are divided in districts which can be organized as communes or municipalities. The communes are smaller towns, generally administered by a local commission led by a &quot;communal president&quot;. The municipalities, which must have more than 10,000 inhabitants, are what is commonly called &quot;cities&quot;. Municipalities have an executive officer (a mayor, called &quot;intendente&quot;) and a legislative body (called &quot;Concejo Municipal&quot;, a deliberative council). For administrative purposes, each department has a head town (&quot;cabecera&quot;), which may be either kind of district.

<text>Eltham ( ) is a district of southeast London, England, within the Royal Borough of Greenwich. It is east-southeast of Charing Cross, and is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. The three wards of Eltham North, South and West have a total population of 35,459. 88,000 people live in Eltham.

==History==

===Origins===
Eltham developed along part of the road from London to Maidstone, and lies almost due south of Woolwich. Mottingham, to the south, became part of the parish on the abolition of all extra-parochial areas, which were rare anomalies in the parish system. Eltham College and other parts of Mottingham were therefore not considered within Eltham&#x27;s boundaries even before the 1860s.

From the sixth century Eltham was in the ancient Lathe of Sutton at Hone. In the Domesday Book of 1086 its hundred was named &quot;Gren[u/v]iz&quot; (Greenwich), which by 1166 was renamed &quot;Blachehedfeld&quot; (Blackheath) because it had become the location of the annual or more frequent hundred gathering.

By the 1880s the lathes and hundreds of Kent had become obsolete, with the civil parishes and other districts assuming modern governmental functions.

Eltham was a civil parish of Kent until 1889 when it became part of the County of London and from 1900 formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. The metropolitan borough was abolished in 1965 and Eltham then became part of the then London Borough of Greenwich.

Eltham today is one of the largest suburban developments in the borough with a population of almost 88,000 people.

Eltham lies on a high, sandy plateau which gave it a strategic significance. That, and the fact of its position close to the main route to the English Channel ports in Kent, led to the creation of the moated medieval Eltham Palace, still its most notable landmark. Daniel Lysons described its origins.

The nearby manor of Well Hall was home to Sir John Pulteney, four times Lord Mayor of London, and later to wealthy Catholic William Roper and his wife Margaret (daughter of Sir Thomas More, known to Catholics as Saint Thomas More, Chancellor to King Henry VIII). In 1733 Sir Gregory Page bought this estate for £19,000 and demolished Roper House, building Page House – later known as Well Hall House – on the site. Until its demolition in 1931, Well Hall House variously served as a home to watchmaker John Arnold, and later to socialist Hubert Bland and author Edith Nesbit.

Also of note is Avery Hill Park and its former mansion, accessed from Bexley Road and at various points along the three miles (5 km) of other streets that surround the park. Avery Hill was the home of Colonel North, who made his fortune working in the Chilean nitrate industry. A hothouse is still open to the public and contains temperate and tropical plants. There are also remnants of the formal gardens in the public park. The mansion was part of the University of Greenwich, which had a significant presence on two sites in the area. However, in 2014 the university announced its intentions to withdraw from the site and has now done so.

===Suburban development after 1900===
The village streets adjacent to the Palace, and the surrounding land, remained rural until Archibald Cameron Corbett bought the Eltham Park Estate and developed it with well-built suburban housing between 1900 and 1914. The Bexley Heath Railway (see below) had opened what came to be known as the Bexleyheath Line in 1895. Suburban development of the district accelerated when the Government, through His Majesty&#x27;s Office of Works, built the Progress Estate in Well Hall and large estates of temporary hutments in 1915, to house the vastly increased numbers of wartime workers in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In the early years it was called, rather pretentiously, &quot;Well Hall Garden City&quot;. Its name was changed to &quot;Progress Estate&quot; when it was purchased by the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society in 1925. It compares well with later groups of municipal housing in south London – which is surprising given the fact that it was constructed rapidly between February and December 1915 and is sub-divided by the South Circular Road and (until about 1988) by the even busier A2 Trunk Road. The Progress Estate was made a Conservation Area in 2007.

Urban development 
After World War I the building of housing estates continued unabated. By the beginning of World War II, four large estates were in existence: the Progress Estate (1915), the Page Estate (1923), Middle Park (1931–36), and Horn Park (begun 1936, completed 1950s). The latter two were built on Eltham Palace&#x27;s former hunting parks. Coldharbour Estate was built in 1947. The small council estates of Pippenhall and Strongbow Crescent were completed about 1960. Since that time new house building has been limited to small private &quot;infill developments&quot; and replacements for demolished properties.

Eltham residents occupy a housing stock of mixed age, particularly towards Eltham Park and the multiple streets with &#x27;Glen&#x27; in their names. There are some fine houses scattered around Eltham. At least two roads, North Park and Court Road, contain million pound homes, and some of the older Victorian buildings have been subdivided into apartments.

A Micropub, The Long Pond, was opened in December 2014 - the first pub in Eltham Park for at least 115 years as Archibald Cameron Corbett would not give permission for pubs and put a restrictive covenant on the land. However, since the Licensing Act 2003 was implemented in 2005, Premise Licences are now granted by the local authority (Greenwich London Borough Council) instead of magistrates, as long as the applicant satisfies the council and the &quot;responsible authorities&quot; (such as Police, Environmental Health, Fire Service) that they will uphold the four licensing objectives (prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; prevention of public nuisance, protection of children from harm), then a licence will be granted. Several licensed premises in Eltham Park now offer &quot;Off Sales&quot;.

Domestic architecture 
===Incidents===
In 1990, an IRA bomb outside the Eltham Palace headquarters of the Royal Army Educational Corps injured seven people (see 1990 Eltham bombing). The area was targeted three times by the Mardi Gra bomber in the 1990s.

== Geography ==

=== Description and location ===

Eltham has a varied topography. Map 6 shows contours, spot heights and water courses. The centre of Eltham is on a plateau at about the 60m level with the High Street running along its centre. There is a scarp slope to the west of the plateau from the top of which are unrestricted views across South London. Eltham Palace occupies a commanding position on the edge of the scarp. Eltham Hill offers the steepest descent from the plateau, starting at Eltham High Street and descending 30m over 1 km due west at the &quot;Yorkshire Grey&quot; (now a McDonald&#x27;s outlet). The land to the north of Eltham rises to form the southern slope of Shooter&#x27;s Hill, one of the highest points in London at a height of . The recently (2014) restored 18th century belvedere Severndroog Castle offers wide views from its observation platform which is above sea level.

From Eltham Church at the High Street rises gently to and continues east as Bexley Road at a slightly lower level.

To the south the plateau slopes gently downwards to Mottingham (at ) and New Eltham (at )

Eltham is devoid of any major water features, although the River Thames is approximately away from Eltham&#x27;s northern limits. The most prominent body of water is the River Quaggy which runs to the south-west of Eltham and joins the River Ravensbourne at Lewisham. The Quaggy receives additional water from a tributary named Little Quaggy, flowing from the lake of The Tarn in Mottingham, and feeds the wetlands in Sutcliffe Park. The only other significant watercourse is the River Shuttle, which rises in Avery Hill Park and flows east to join the River Cray.

===Parks and open spaces===

There is a large variety of open green space in Eltham, in the form of parkland, fields and woodland.
&quot;Green Chain Walks&quot; are signposted footpaths that run through or link the green spaces. Some are also bridleways or cycle routes.

*&quot;Avery Hill Park&quot; is large, open parkland, to the east. It is most notable for its Winter Garden, a hothouse containing tropical trees and plants from around the world. The parkland was acquired by the London County Council in 1902.
*&quot;Oxleas Woods, Castle Wood and Jack Wood&quot;, directly north of Eltham, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Oxleas Wood covers and is at least 8,000 years old. The wood is home to specimen of tree including oak, silver birch, hornbeam and coppice hazel. Severndroog Castle, built in 1784 as a memorial to William James of the East India Company, stands in Castle Wood.
*&quot;Sutcliffe Park&quot; is a park at the westernmost point of Eltham. Previously known as Harrow Meadow, the parkland was reclaimed from the River Quaggy in the 1930s. The Quaggy was diverted into culverts, and the park officially opened in 1937 as Sutcliffe Park, named after the Borough&#x27;s engineer. On 26 June 1954, the athletics track in Sutcliffe Park was opened, and has since been home to the Cambridge Harriers. In 2003, the park was re-landscaped as a wetland area. The River Quaggy was allowed to flow above-ground in the area, for the first time in 70 years. The park borders the Ferrier Estate, which was completed in 1970 and demolished by 2012 to make way for &quot;Kidbrooke Village&quot;. 
*The &quot;Royal Blackheath Golf Course&quot; and the adjoining &quot;Tarn&quot; date back to Tudor times. The golf club, founded in 1766 to the north in Blackheath and to the south since its merger with Eltham Golf club in 1923, is the oldest golf club in the world outside Scotland. The club house Eltham Lodge is a grade I listed building.
*Well Hall Pleasaunce – formal gardens, ponds and woodland, originally the site of a manor house, in Well Hall
*Eltham Park North and Eltham Park South are the final major green areas in Eltham. The southern park is adjacent to the Eltham Warren Golf Course.
*&quot;The Tarn&quot;, south of Eltham High Street, a public garden, and bird sanctuary, with a lake amongst woodland.
*&quot;Horn Park&quot;&#x27;, southwest of Eltham High Street, a public park in Horn Park, with grassland, woodland, playground, football pitch and skate park.
Eltham Parks North and South, Avery Hill, Sutcliffe Park, The Tarn, Well Hall Pleasaunce and Horn Park all have Green Flag status.

In the 1990s the defence of Oxleas Wood to the north east of the town became a focus for a pan-European campaign to resist high capacity urban roads. Significantly the European Court of Justice found the UK government at fault for not adequately assessing the environmental impact of the planned road, that would have joined Beckton to Falconwood and perhaps – if objectors&#x27; fears are to be believed – been a first stage of a wider orbital road through Catford (a revival of a Greater London Council-backed Ringway Two).

==Demographics==

In December 2010, the population of Eltham parliament constituency was 63,059, although this figure includes the wards of Coldharbour and New Eltham, Kidbrooke with Hornfair and Shooter&#x27;s Hill. 63,082 people live in the SE9 postcode district; of these, 30,398 are male and 32,684 are female. People over 65 make up 17.9% of Eltham&#x27;s electorate.

===Migration and ethnicity===

At the census of 2011, the white population of Eltham was recorded at 80.95%; the largest minority group in Eltham was Black-African and Black-Caribbean people, who comprised 7.46% of the total population with Asians comprising 6.62%. Eltham&#x27;s proportion of white residents is significantly higher than the Royal Borough of Greenwich average of 62.5%. Eltham&#x27;s population by ward in 2011 was as follows:
==Culture, identity and community==

Eltham has an unusually high quotient of green space, with large areas of woodland to the north and east, including the historic woodland of Shooters Hill and Oxleas Wood, the Woodlands Farm community holding, Eltham Parks north and south and extensive parkland heading into Avery Hill park. Thus it is both &#x27;suburban&#x27; and &#x27;urban&#x27;, and it forms part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, an Inner London borough.
The town centre supports a loyal core of shoppers, diners, and drinkers, but the nightlife is modest. In recent years there has been great effort by local town centre businesses and other important Eltham stakeholders, to drive business, community and tourism improvements, that will help sustain the town centre. These efforts resulted in the formation of an Eltham town centre partnership (ETCP), chaired by an elected local stakeholder. Greenwich council had a member and officer representatives along with the University of Greenwich. The ETCP encouraged the development of A new town centre commerce Association – The Association of Commerce for Eltham (ACE). ACE established a new Town Centre web portal, which offered a basic business directory and tried to increase interaction between business and community groups. Both were offline as of June 2023.

In 2007, the new Eltham Centre opened just off the High Street including council offices and a new swimming pool and incorporating the early 20th century library.

The Eltham Society was founded in 1965 with the aim of &quot;Preserving the past, Conserving the present, and Protecting the future&quot;. In 1993 it erected the Eltham Town sign in the high street. The Society is responsible for various publications.

In 2006 the community magazine &quot;SEnine&quot; was launched. As of 2023 it is published monthly and distributed free. As well as news and discussion of current affairs it also lists forthcoming events. It also carries many illustrated articles about Eltham history. Digitised copies of old issues are available on the SEnine website. A community website &quot;This is Eltham&quot; provides updates on current events.

High Street and environs

On 22 April 1993, 18-year-old black student Stephen Lawrence was fatally stabbed in Well Hall. The crime quickly became one of the most high-profile racially motivated murders in modern Britain. Five teenagers were later accused of his murder but the case was dropped due to a lack of evidence. In 2011 as a result of new evidence coming to light, Gary Dobson and David Norris stood trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence. They were convicted on 3 January 2012.

Other instances of racial attacks were documented throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with Eltham compared to a &quot;sundown town&quot; a name used to describe communities in America&#x27;s Deep South where black people were advised for their own safety to not be out in public after dark. Eltham was, for example, compared to Jasper, Texas.

During the 2011 England riots, Eltham received national attention when, for three nights, a vigilante group of 300–400 people occupied the centre of Eltham, saying they were protecting people and property from rioters. Extra police from other UK forces were sent to maintain order. The group gathered after rumours that Eltham would be the latest place to be hit by unrest. A small number claimed to be EDL members. BBC reporters tracked fans of Millwall and Charlton walking along Eltham High St, with riot police following at a distance. Police were forced to move the crowds on for fear of violence, and were involved in minor clashes, but Eltham did not have any riot damage.

==Education==
Primary schools in Eltham include: Alderwood, Christ Church (Shooters Hill Rd), Deansfield, Gordon, Middle Park, Ealdham, Eltham C of E (Founded 1814), Gordon, Haimo, Henwick, Kidbrooke Park, St Mary&#x27;s, St Thomas More and Wingfield.

Secondary schools in Eltham include Harris Academy Greenwich, St Thomas More Catholic School, Eltham Hill School for Girls, and Stationers&#x27; Crown Woods Academy (built upon the land of King Henry VIII&#x27;s hunting grounds, and until 2011 named Crown Woods School).

One campus of the University of Greenwich was in Avery Hill Park, on the borders of Eltham and New Eltham, but has closed.

==Sport and leisure==
In 1654, three men were prosecuted at Eltham for playing cricket on a Sunday, one of the sport&#x27;s earliest references.

Eltham Cricket Club, founded in 1863 and the last club for whom WG Grace played, are based at Footscray Rugby Club.

Eltham has a Non-League football club Cray Valley Paper Mills F.C., which plays at Badgers Sports Ground (shared with Greenwich Borough F.C.) in Middle Park. Cray Valley plays an annual charity match against their local non-league rivals Eltham Old Boys Football Club.

Eltham&#x27;s parks provide many facilities for sports and fitness. Eltham Park South has a jogging track and six tennis courts. The Pleasaunce has a bowling green and pavilion. Avery Hill Park has changing rooms and half a dozen football and rugby pitches and with cricket pitches laid out in the summer. 
The land adjoining Avery Hill is occupied by many sports grounds which include Footscray RUFC, London Electricity Sorts and Social Club, Charlton Park RFC, Sparrows Lane Sports Ground, Cambridge Mission Sports Ground, Unilever Sports Ground, Metrogas Amateur Sports Association, St James Mar Thoma Amateur Sports Ground and the SRC2 Sports Club. The same area is also home to the training ground of professional football club Charlton Athletic at Sparrows Lane.

Adjacent to Well Hall Pleasaunce is University of Greenwich Athletics Ground. This has a pavilion with changing rooms and six pitches for football and rugby

Preserving these sports areas from the encroachments of property developers is a constant battle for Elthams environmental and community groups. Currently (2014) the focus is on the long disused Gaelic Sports Field in Avery Hill Road, for which there is a planning application to build 150 houses.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Eltham, along with most other suburbs in south east London, is not served by the London Underground. Commuters rely on two rail lines to central London, and the road network. Trains through Eltham terminate at London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street or London Victoria in a westerly direction, and Crayford, Dartford, Slade Green, Gravesend, Gillingham or Rochester in an easterly direction. Given the lack of London Underground access, the two suburban rail lines work at, or above, their capacity during peak-hour commuting to central London. Fast trains take as little as 20 minutes to get to London Charing Cross. Eltham&#x27;s closest London Underground station is North Greenwich tube station, a few miles to the northwest.

Bexleyheath line

Originally opened on 1 May 1895 by a private company, the Bexleyheath Line was taken over by the South Eastern Railway after it suffered bankruptcy. There were originally two stations in Eltham: Eltham Well Hall and Eltham Park. Eltham Well Hall station opened in 1895. Eltham Park station opened (after a prolonged legal wrangle) on 1 July 1908. On 11 June 1972, a London-bound train came off the track at Well Hall, killing 6 and injuring 126. Both Eltham stations were closed in 1985 and replaced by a new ‘Eltham’ station; this coincided with the construction of the Rochester Way Relief Road part of which was built on the site of Eltham Well Hall station. Glenlea Road between Well Hall Road and Archery Road was replaced by the station forecourt and a bus station (this had previously been adjacent to Well Hall station). The new rail station was built above the new road at the point it travels through what is sometimes referred to as &#x27;the Eltham tunnel&#x27;. The new station has a modernist feel.

Dartford Loop

The Dartford Loop line, about south of Eltham High Street, was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 1 September 1866. It is commonly known by locals as the &#x27;Dartford line via Sidcup&#x27;. There are two stations on this line that serve the population living to the south of Eltham: Mottingham station, originally named &#x27;Eltham Station&#x27; until &#x27;Eltham Well Hall&#x27; opened, and New Eltham station. Neither station is as large as Eltham station, but both have been heavily upgraded since opening.

===Roads===
Eltham High Street lies on the A210, the original A20 London to Maidstone road. But the A20 has now been diverted southwards, passing through Mottingham, and it is a dual carriageway that connects to the M20 motorway in Kent. Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 has replaced the Rochester Road section, which was always very congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of lead-free petrol).

The upgrading of these two arterial routes in and out of London means that Eltham is handily positioned between the A20 and A2. Driving on either of these roads into London soon results in congestion, although the A2 does connect through to the Blackwall Tunnel under the Thames, and thus into east London, all on dual carriageway. Driving eastwards allows access to the Dartford Tunnel, and the Kent countryside, in as little as 20 minutes in off-peak hours.

Crossing the two from north to the south is the A205 South Circular road, a busy arterial route.

The back streets of Eltham have been largely traffic-calmed by the local Council, but there are chronic rat-runs as many of the measures are ineffective or insufficient. Provision for cyclists is modest, while there are some interesting footpaths along ancient rights of way, for example in Oxleas Wood and Avery Hill Park.

===Buses===
Scheduled coaches, marketed as part of the National Express network, link Eltham Green to Pimlico and Victoria in central London and to several destinations on the Kent coast via Bluewater (a retail-based development on a grand scale in Dartford borough) and Canterbury. Eltham Green is one of the few places in south London served by National Express coaches.

Eltham is served by Transport for London bus routes 122, 124, 126, 132, 160, 161, 162, 233, 286, 314, 321, B15 and B16. These routes connect Eltham to Beckenham, Bexley, Bexleyheath, Blackfen, Bromley, Catford, Charlton, Chinbrook, Chislehurst, Crystal Palace, Foots Cray, Greenwich, Grove Park, Horn Park, Kidbrooke, Lee, Lewisham, Middle Park, New Addington, New Cross, North Greenwich, Plumstead, Ruxley, Sidcup, Swanley, Well Hall, Welling and Woolwich.

<text>Eltham () is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 20 km north-east of the Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Eltham recorded a population of 18,847 at the 2021 census.

Eltham is one of the &#x27;green wedge&#x27; areas that provide relatively undeveloped, accessible environments within the Melbourne suburban region. These green wedge areas are under constant pressure from developments such as road and freeway expansions, but Eltham has managed to retain many tree-lined streets and leafy reserves. However, the character of the suburb is changing rapidly, with increased road traffic and higher-density housing becoming more common.

Eltham&#x27;s tourist attractions include the artists colony Montsalvat and the Diamond Valley Railway, the largest ridable miniature railway in Australia.

==History==
A reserve for a village at the junction of the Diamond Creek and Yarra River is shown on maps around 1848. By 1851 the first Crown allotments were being subdivided and sold, along with a private subdivision developed by J. M. Holloway, known as Little Eltham. At this time, the town&#x27;s centre was located around the intersection of Pitt Street and Main Road. An early settler was Henry Dendy who operated a flour mill.

Eltham Post Office opened on 1 February 1854.

The first Eltham Cemetery Trust was appointed in February 1860. The Eltham Court House was built in 1860 and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Database. The Eltham Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

St Margaret&#x27;s Church commenced construction in 1861 at 10 John St Eltham.

The &quot;Evelyn Observer&quot; was a weekly newspaper published from 1873 to 1942. It had various titles over the years. Digitsed copies can be accessed for various dates via Trove. Other local newspapers have included Eltham and Whittlesea Shires Advertiser and Diamond Creek Valley Advocate (1917-1922) and Eltham and Whittlesea Shire Advertiser (1940-1942) These papers can also be accessed via Trove.

The Eltham Hotel was established in 1867 and continues to be in business.

The arrival of the railway line in 1902 drew business further north along Main Road to the current town centre.

A war memorial in the form of an obelisk of granite was unveiled 3 August 1919 in what was then the centre of the township. In the 1960s it was relocated to the front of the Eltham RSL sub branch. It was moved again in 2010 in front of the Eltham War Memorial Building Complex. The Eltham War Memorial Building Complex recognises those who served and died in World War 2. The community complex originally featured an infant welfare centre, war memorial gates and a wrought iron arch, memorial garden, pre-school and children&#x27;s library.

Eltham Presbyterian Church opened in 1958.

The Eltham Refugee Housing and Support Project was delivered in partnership with St Vincent&#x27;s Health Australia and CatholicCare to provide accommodation and settlement support to newly arrived refugees from Syria and Iraq. From November 2016 to October 2018, refugees were provided with affordable accommodation in refurbished units on the site of St Vincent&#x27;s Care Services Eltham Aged Care facility. During this time, CatholicCare provided tenancy and settlement support.

Leader Community Newspapers published the &quot;Diamond Valley Leader&quot; which included Eltham in its reporting area for some years before it ceased publication in June 2020.

The historic courthouse, the oldest building in the Shire of Nillumbik was restored by Ducon Building Solutions and RBA Architects and Conservation Consultants and completed by March 2022

<doc id="520574" wikidata="Q898407" url="?curid=520574" title="Venlafaxine">
<text>Venlafaxine, sold under the brand name Effexor among others, is an antidepressant medication of the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Studies have shown that venlafaxine improves post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a recommended first-line treatment. It may also be used for chronic neuropathic pain. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). It is also available as the salt venlafaxine besylate (venlafaxine benzenesulfonate monohydrate) in an extended-release formulation (Venbysi XR).
Common side effects include loss of appetite, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, sweating, insomnia, drowsiness and sexual problems. Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, mania, and serotonin syndrome. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped. A meta-analysis of randomized trials in depression found an increased rate of serious adverse events, particularly sexual dysfunction and anorexia, and several non-serious adverse efffects, including nervousness, asthenia, and tremor. There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the baby. How it works is not entirely clear, but it seems to be related to the potentiation of the activity of some neurotransmitters in the brain.
Venlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1993. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 44th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Venlafaxine is used primarily for the treatment of depression, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and vasomotor symptoms.

Venlafaxine has been used off label for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and migraine prevention. It may work on pain via effects on the opioid receptor. It has also been found to reduce the severity of &#x27;hot flashes&#x27; in menopausal women and men on hormonal therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Due to its action on both the serotoninergic and adrenergic systems, venlafaxine is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Case reports, open trials and blinded comparisons with established medications have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder.

=== Depression ===
A comparative meta-analysis of 21 major antidepressants found that venlafaxine, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants, although the quality of many comparisons was assessed as low or very low.

Venlafaxine was similar in efficacy to the atypical antidepressant bupropion; however, the remission rate was lower for venlafaxine. In a double-blind study, patients who did not respond to an SSRI were switched to either venlafaxine or another SSRI (citalopram); similar improvement was observed in both groups.

Studies have not established its efficacy for use in pediatric populations. In children and adolescents with depression, venlafaxine increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts.

Higher doses (e.g., 225 mg and 375 mg per day) of venlafaxine are more effective than lower doses (e.g., 75 mg per day) but also cause more side effects.

Studies have shown that the extended-release is superior to the immediate-release form of venlafaxine.

A 2017 meta-analysis has showed that the efficacy of venlafaxine is not correlated with baseline severity of depression. In other words, regardless of how severe a person&#x27;s depression is at treatment initiation, the efficacy of venlafaxine remains consistent and is not influenced by the severity of depression at the start of treatment.

== Contraindications ==
Venlafaxine is not recommended in patients hypersensitive to it, nor should it be taken by anyone who is allergic to the inactive ingredients, which include gelatin, cellulose, ethylcellulose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and hypromellose. It should not be used in conjunction with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it can cause potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine might interact with tramadol or other opioids, as well as trazodone, so caution is needed while mixing multiple serotonergic agents together.

== Adverse effects ==
Venlafaxine can increase eye pressure, so those with glaucoma may require more frequent eye checks.

A 2017 meta-analysis estimated venlafaxine discontinuation rate due to adverse effects to be 9.4%.

=== Suicide ===
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to carry a black box warning with a generic warning about a possible suicide risk.

A 2014 meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials of venlafaxine for the treatment of depression in adults found that compared to placebo, venlafaxine reduced the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.

A study conducted in Finland followed more than 15,000 patients for 3.4 years. Venlafaxine increased suicide risk by 60% (statistically significant), as compared to no treatment. At the same time, fluoxetine (Prozac) halved the suicide risk.

In a study sponsored by Wyeth, which produces and markets venlafaxine, the data on more than 200,000 cases were obtained from the UK general practice research database. At baseline, patients prescribed venlafaxine had a greater number of risk factors for suicide (such as prior suicide attempts) than patients treated with other anti-depressants. The patients taking venlafaxine had a significantly higher risk of suicide than the ones on fluoxetine or citalopram (Celexa). After adjusting for known risk factors, venlafaxine was associated with an increased risk of suicide relative to fluoxetine and dothiepin which was not statistically significant. A statistically significant greater risk for attempted suicide remained after adjustment, but the authors concluded that it could be due to residual confounding.

An analysis of clinical trials by the FDA statisticians showed the incidence of suicidal behaviour among the adults on venlafaxine to be not significantly different from fluoxetine or placebo.

Venlafaxine is contraindicated in children, adolescents, and young adults. In children and adolescents with depression, venlafaxine increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts.

=== Serotonin syndrome ===
The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (also classified as &quot;serotonin toxicity&quot;) may occur with venlafaxine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, including but not limited to SSRIs and SNRIs, many hallucinogens such as tryptamines and phenethylamines (e.g., LSD/LSA, DMT, MDMA, mescaline), dextromethorphan (DXM), tramadol, tapentadol, pethidine (meperidine) and triptans and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Venlafaxine-induced serotonin syndrome has also been reported when venlafaxine has been taken in isolation in overdose. An abortive serotonin syndrome state, in which some but not all of the symptoms of the full serotonin syndrome are present, has been reported with venlafaxine at mid-range dosages (150 mg per day). A case of a patient with serotonin syndrome induced by low-dose venlafaxine (37.5 mg per day) has also been reported.

=== Pregnancy ===
There are few well-controlled studies of venlafaxine in pregnant women. A study released in May 2010 by the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests use of venlafaxine doubles the risk of miscarriage. Consequently, venlafaxine should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. A large case-control study done as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and published in 2012 found a significant association between venlafaxine use during pregnancy and several birth defects including anencephaly, cleft palate, septal heart defects and coarctation of the aorta. Prospective studies have not shown any statistically significant congenital malformations. There have, however, been some reports of self-limiting effects on newborn infants. As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), these effects are generally short-lived, lasting only 3 to 5 days, and rarely resulting in severe complications.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
According to the ISBD Task Force report on antidepressant use in bipolar disorder, during the course of treatment for depression with those suffering from bipolar I and II, venlafaxine &quot;appears to carry a particularly high risk of inducing pathologically elevated states of mood and behavior.&quot; Because venlafaxine appears to be more likely than SSRIs and bupropion to induce mania and mixed episodes in these patients, provider discretion is advised through &quot;carefully evaluating individual clinical cases and circumstances.&quot;

=== Liver injury ===
A rare but serious side effect of venlafaxine is liver injury. It appears to affect both male and female patients with a median age of 44. Cessation of venlafaxine is one of the appropriate measures of management. While the mechanism of venlafaxine-related liver injury remains unclear, findings suggest that it may be related to a CYP2D6 polymorphism.

=== Overdose ===
Most patients overdosing with venlafaxine develop only mild symptoms. Plasma venlafaxine concentrations in overdose survivors have ranged from 6 to 24 mg/L, while postmortem blood levels in fatalities are often in the 10–90 mg/L range. Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcome compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Healthcare professionals are advised to prescribe Effexor and Effexor XR in the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management to reduce the risk of overdose. It is usually reserved as a second-line treatment for depression due to a combination of its superior efficacy to the first-line treatments like fluoxetine, paroxetine and citalopram and greater frequency of side effects like nausea, headache, insomnia, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, sexual dysfunction, sweating and nervousness.

There is no specific antidote for venlafaxine, and management is generally supportive, providing treatment for the immediate symptoms. Administration of activated charcoal can prevent absorption of the drug. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs is indicated. Seizures are managed with benzodiazepines or other anticonvulsants. Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, exchange transfusion, or hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of benefit in hastening the removal of venlafaxine, due to the drug&#x27;s high volume of distribution.

=== Withdrawal syndrome ===
People stopping venlafaxine commonly experience SSRI withdrawal symptoms such as dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sensation of electric shocks (commonly called &quot;brain zaps&quot;), and sleep disturbance. Venlafaxine has a higher rate of moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms relative to other antidepressants (similar to the SSRI paroxetine).

The higher risk and increased severity of withdrawal symptoms relative to other antidepressants may be related to the short half-life of venlafaxine and its active metabolite. After stopping venlafaxine, the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine decrease, leading to the hypothesis that the withdrawal symptoms could result from an overly rapid reduction of neurotransmitter levels.

=== Other ===
In rare cases, drug-induced akathisia can occur after use in some people.

Venlafaxine should be used with caution in hypertensive patients. Venlafaxine must be discontinued if significant hypertension persists. It can also have undesirable cardiovascular effects.

== Pharmacology ==


=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Venlafaxine is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has also been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It is described as &#x27;synthetic phenethylamine bicyclic derivative with antidepressant activity&#x27;. It works by blocking the transporter &quot;reuptake&quot; proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin and norepinephrine. Additionally, in high doses, it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. The frontal cortex largely lacks dopamine transporters; therefore venlafaxine can increase dopamine neurotransmission in this part of the brain.

Venlafaxine selectively inhibits the serotonin transporter at lower doses, but at a dose of 225 mg per day it additionally blocks the norepinephrine transporter (NET), as measured by the intravenous tyramine pressor test.

Venlafaxine indirectly affects opioid receptors as well as the α2-adrenergic receptor, and was shown to increase pain threshold in mice. These benefits with respect to pain were reversed with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, thus supporting an opioid mechanism.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with at least 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into systemic circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to desvenlafaxine (&quot;O&quot;-desmethylvenlafaxine, now marketed as a separate medication named Pristiq), which is just as potent an SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically important in terms of efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of venlafaxine has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of venlafaxine and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of venlafaxine is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms.

Venlafaxine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which pumps it out of the brain. The gene encoding P-gp, ABCB1, has the SNP rs2032583, with alleles C and T. The majority of people (about 70% of Europeans and 90% of East Asians) have the TT variant. A 2007 study found that carriers of at least one C allele (variant CC or CT) are 7.72 times more likely than non-carriers to achieve remission after 4 weeks of treatment with amitriptyline, citalopram, paroxetine or venlafaxine (all P-gp substrates). The study included patients with mood disorders other than major depression, such as bipolar II; the ratio is 9.4 if these other disorders are excluded. At the 6-week mark, 75% of C-carriers had remitted, compared to only 38% of non-carriers.

==Chemistry==
The IUPAC name of venlafaxine is 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol, though it is sometimes referred to as (±)-1-[a-[a-(dimethylamino)methyl]-&quot;p&quot;-methoxybenzyl]cyclohexanol. It consists of two enantiomers present in equal quantities (termed a racemic mixture), both of which have the empirical formula of C17H27NO2. It is usually sold as a mixture of the respective hydrochloride salts, (&quot;R&quot;/&quot;S&quot;)-1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol hydrochloride, C17H28ClNO2, which is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Venlafaxine is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs.

Venlafaxine extended-release is chemically the same as normal venlafaxine. The extended-release (controlled release) version distributes the release of the drug into the gastrointestinal tract over a longer period than normal venlafaxine. This results in a lower peak plasma concentration. Studies have shown that the extended-release formula has a lower incidence of nausea as a side effect, resulting in better compliance.

=== Interactions ===
Venlafaxine should be taken with caution when using St John&#x27;s wort. Venlafaxine may lower the seizure threshold, and coadministration with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as bupropion and tramadol should be done with caution and at low doses.

==Society and culture==
=== Recreational use ===
Venlafaxine can be abused as a recreational drug, with damages that can manifest within a month.

=== Brand names ===

Venlafaxine was originally marketed as Effexor in most of the world; generic venlafaxine has been available since around 2008 and extended-release venlafaxine has been available since around 2010.

Venlafaxine is sold under many brand names worldwide. In some countries, Effexor is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

== Veterinary uses ==
Veterinary overdose in dogs is very well treated by Cyproheptadine HCl.

Venlafaxine is highly toxic to Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta phytoplankton. Cats are drawn to the smell of venlafaxine and tend to ingest the pills, which is highly toxic to them.

<text>Robert Hayman (14 August 1575 – November 1629) was a poet, colonist and Proprietary Governor of Bristol&#x27;s Hope colony in Newfoundland.

== Early life and education ==

Hayman was born in Wolborough near Newton Abbot, Devon, the eldest of nine children. His mother was Alice Gaverocke and his father, Nicholas Hayman, a prosperous citizen and later mayor and MP of both Totnes and Dartmouth. By 1579 the family was living in Totnes, where in the high street Hayman as a small boy met Sir Francis Drake, who presented him with an orange (Hayman records the incident in one of his poems).

According to the 17th-century historian Anthony Wood Hayman was educated at Exeter College and the college register shows him matriculating on 15 October 1590 (the register wrongly shows his age as eleven whereas in fact he was fifteen). He then, according to Wood, &quot;retired to Lincolns-inn, without the honour of a degree&quot;: but here Wood is incorrect, as Hayman commenced B.A. on 8 July 1596. He was admitted as a law student to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 16 October 1596, where, again according to Wood, he &quot;studied for a time the municipal law&quot;, though modern researches find no evidence of this or of any intention to qualify as a lawyer. In his supplication for B.A. Hayman had mentioned a plan to travel and study in Europe, and this apparently happened, as in a letter his father wrote to Robert Cecil in 1600 he states that he hoped for a career for his son in some government office, and that towards this end he had educated him at both Oxford University and at Poitiers. Wood explains that &quot;his geny being well known to be poetical, (he) fell into acquaintance with&quot; a literary circle which included Ben Jonson, Michael Drayton, John Donne, George Wither, John Owen and others. These encouraged his literary efforts with the result, according to Wood, that Hayman had &quot;the general vogue of a poet&quot;. Perhaps because of these distractions Hayman seems not to have achieved any significant public office in England. Although Edward Sharpham dedicated a play to him in 1607 there is nothing further known about his activities for twenty years until he emerges as a venturer and colonist to the new world.

==Family==

Hayman was married on 21 May 1604 at St Petroc&#x27;s Church, Exeter, to Grace Spicer, daughter of a prominent merchant of Exeter; but they appear to have had no children and as Hayman does not mention her directly in his works it seems she died young. Several of the poems later published in the book &#x27;Quodlibets&#x27; however are dedicated to other members of the Spicer family, so he apparently remained on friendly terms with them.

==Colonial career==

Hayman was appointed the Newfoundland colony&#x27;s first and only governor in 1618 when Bristol&#x27;s Society of Merchant Venturers received a charter from King James I of England to establish the settlement. Hayman&#x27;s brother-in-law John Barker was the society&#x27;s master. Hayman lived in the colony for fifteen months before returning to England and visited again over several summers until his tenure as governor ended in 1628. Much of his work was in England raising money for the settlement, publicizing it and encouraging more colonisation efforts. In 1628 he petitioned the king&#x27;s favourite the Duke of Buckingham to forward a &quot;Proposition of profitt and honor&quot; to the king which set out the need to encourage continued colonization of Newfoundland, and which specifically mentioned a plan to build a settlement to be called &#x27;Carolinople&#x27; (i.e. &quot;Charles&#x27;s Town&quot;).

As Newfoundland&#x27;s first poet in English, Hayman is remembered for his writings extolling the island, its climate and its early English pioneers. In his leisure hours as governor in Harbour Grace he composed a work later published in England as &quot;Quodlibets&quot;. &quot;Quodlibets&quot; (&quot;What you will&quot;) was the first book in the English language written in what would become Canada. Some of it consisted of original short poems by Hayman, and some of translations, both of Latin poems by John Owen (epigrammatist) and of French prose by Rabelais. It was published in London in 1628, presumably as part of Hayman&#x27;s attempts to raise interest in the colony.

Although Hayman apparently remained committed to Newfoundland he was also interested in other colonial ventures, including one to Guyana under the direction of Robert Harcourt. Having arranged his financial affairs he made his will late in the fall of 1628 and left in the &quot;Little Hopewell&quot; for the Amazon. By February 1629 (new style) he was in Guiana looking into using the river &#x27;Wiapoco&#x27; (modern Oyapock) as a trading route.

==Death==

It was while travelling up the Oyapock by canoe that Hayman died of a sudden fever and was hastily buried by his companions near the banks of the river, on or about 17 October 1629. His will, signed and sealed on 17 November 1628 but not proved until 1633 (1632 Old Style), leaves his estate to &quot;my loving Cosin and Nephew Thomas Muchell of Longaston&quot; (modern Long Ashton) &quot;in the Countie of Somersett...&quot;. His will also mentions two &quot;policies of insurance&quot; taken out with the diocesan chancellor of London, Arthur Duck. Of the value of £100 each, one related to the safe arrival of Hayman&#x27;s ship in Guiana and the other was &quot;of one hundred pounds assured by the said Doctor Arthur Ducke on my life&quot;.

<doc id="520576" wikidata="Q192017" url="?curid=520576" title="Monument Valley">
<text>Monument Valley (, , meaning &quot;valley of the rocks&quot;) is a region of the Colorado Plateau characterized by a cluster of sandstone buttes, with the largest reaching above the valley floor. The most famous butte formations are located in northeastern Arizona along the Utah–Arizona state line. The valley is considered sacred by the Navajo Nation, the Native American people within whose reservation it lies.

Monument Valley has been featured in many forms of media since the 1930s. Famed director John Ford used the location for a number of his Westerns. Film critic Keith Phipps wrote that &quot;its have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West&quot;.

==Geography and geology==

Monument Valley is part of the Colorado Plateau. The elevation of the valley floor ranges from above sea level. The floor is largely siltstone of the Cutler Group, or sand derived from it, deposited by the meandering rivers that carved the valley. The valley&#x27;s vivid red coloration comes from iron oxide exposed in the weathered siltstone. The darker, blue-gray rocks in the valley get their color from manganese oxide.

The buttes arising from the valley floor are clearly stratified, with three principal layers. The lowest layer is the Organ Rock Shale, the middle is de Chelly Sandstone, and the top layer is the Moenkopi Formation capped by Shinarump Conglomerate. Major rock formations include West and East Mitten Buttes, Merrick Butte, Hunts Mesa, Eagle Mesa, Sentinel Mesa, Brighams Tomb, Castle Rock, Stagecoach, Big Indian, Rain God Mesa, Spearhead Mesa, Mitchell Mesa, Mitchell Butte, Gray Whiskers, Elephant Butte, Camel Butte, Cly Butte, King-on-his-Throne, Rooster Rock, and Setting Hen. Another notable formation is Totem Pole, a highly eroded butte remanent. The valley also includes large stone structures, such as the &quot;Eye of the Sun&quot;.

Between 1945 and 1967, the southern extent of the Monument Upwarp was mined for uranium, which occurs in scattered areas of the Shinarump Conglomerate; vanadium and copper are associated with uranium in some deposits.

==Tourism==
Monument Valley includes much of the area surrounding Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, a Navajo Nation equivalent to a national park. Oljato, for example, is also within the area designated as Monument Valley.

Visitors may pay an access fee and drive through the park on a dirt road. Parts of Monument Valley, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, are accessible only by guided tour.

==Climate==
Monument Valley experiences a desert climate with cold winters and hot summers. While the summers may be hot, the heat is tempered by the region&#x27;s high altitude. Although the valley experiences an average of 54 days above annually, summer highs rarely exceed . Summer nights are comfortably cool, and temperatures drop quickly after sunset. Winters are cold, but daytime highs are usually above freezing. Even in the winter, temperatures below are uncommon, although possible. Monument Valley receives an occasional light snowfall in the winter, but it usually melts within a day or two.

==In visual media==
Monument Valley has been featured in numerous computer games, in print, and in motion pictures, including multiple Westerns directed by John Ford that influenced audiences&#x27; view of the American West, such as: &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948), &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956).

Many more recent movies, with other directors, were also filmed in Monument Valley, including Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968), the first Spaghetti Western to be filmed (in 1967) outside Europe, and Gore Verbinski&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013).

<text>Maryport is a town and civil parish in the Cumberland district, in the ceremonial county of Cumbria, England. In 2011 the parish had a population of 11,262.

The town is situated just outside the Lake District National Park, at the northern end of the former Cumberland Coalfield.

==Location==
Maryport is located on the A596 road north of Workington, west of Keswick and south-west of Carlisle. Silloth is to the north on the B5300 coast road, which passes through the villages of Allonby, Mawbray, Beckfoot and Blitterlees.

It&#x27;s one of the southernmost towns on the Solway Firth, where the River Ellen skirts the grounds of Netherhall School before flowing through Maryport into the Solway Firth.

Maryport railway station is on the Cumbrian Coast Line.

==History==
=== Prehistoric times ===
Evidence for Final Palaeolithic and Mesolithic occupation was found at Netherhall Road. This was the first located archaeological evidence of tuff exploitation in the Lake District.

===Roman and medieval times===
The town was established around 122 as one of several Roman localities called Alauna. It was a command and supply base for the coastal defences at the western extremity of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The town contains substantial remains of the Roman fort, which was the last in a series that stretched southwards along the coast from the wall to prevent it being avoided by crossing the Solway Firth. Geomagnetic surveys have revealed a large Roman town surrounding the fort. A Romano-British (native) settlement located directly beside the fort may even have supplied the fort with food, possibly in exchange for goods like pottery.

The Senhouse Roman Museum adjoins the site of Alauna, and has a replica wooden watch-tower overlooking the fort and the sea. The museum houses a large collection of Roman altar stones found at the site.

On Castle Hill are the earthworks and buried remains of a 12th-century motte-and-bailey castle. On the summit are the foundations of a World War II gun emplacement.

To the north are the ruins of Netherhall Estate. The only remains of this once grand manor are stables and a 14th-century pele tower, largely built of dressed Roman stones presumably from Alauna Roman fort nearby. The tower was formerly part of a large house of later date which was demolished in 1979 following a fire.

===Georgian times===

For many years the town was named Ellenfoot (meaning [settlement] at the foot of the river Ellen) but the name was changed by Humphrey Senhouse as he began developing the town as a port, following the example of Whitehaven. In 1749 an act of Parliament, the (22 Geo. 2. c. 6), was passed to allow the creation of the present town. Humphrey Senhouse named the new town after his wife Mary. The Senhouse family were landowners in the area and responsible for the development of the town and excavation of its Roman past. The family also had interests in the West Indies. In 1770, Humphrey Senhouse&#x27;s son, William, was appointed Surveyor General of Customs in Barbados where he purchased a sugar plantation and managed another for Sir James Lowther of Whitehaven. William&#x27;s brother, Joseph, had a coffee plantation in Dominica. Both men were considerable slave-owners.

It was during this period that the town&#x27;s lighthouse was built.

===Victorian times===
The town quickly developed as an industrial centre throughout the 19th century. An iron foundry opened and the port developed as did shipyards, such as Wood&#x27;s yard and Ritson&#x27;s yard, which was famous for launching ships broadside into the River Ellen because it was not wide enough to allow ships to be launched the usual way.

The Maryport and Carlisle Railway, opened in the 1840s, with George Stephenson as its engineer, made the transport of coal much easier. Large new mines were sunk in the Aspatria area and almost all their production passed through the port. In 1846, 213,152 tons of coal were shipped from Maryport and by 1857 this had risen to more than 340,000 tons. Much of the coal produced in the area was turned into coke for the local iron and steel industry. By 1890, the Allerdale Coal Company had thirty Beehive coke ovens working on its site at Buckhill, Broughton Moor.

In 1874, the owners announced a cut of 10% in the miners&#x27; wages. A strike began in the Aspatria pits and then the owners made a further cut of 15%. By December, the strike had spread to the whole area with 2,000 men involved. The strike lasted until March 1875. There was violence when some &#x27;blacklegs&#x27; were assaulted and many colliers left the area to seek work elsewhere.
In 1894, John Osmaston who operated the Dearham Colliery became insolvent and the bank took over his pits. Two groups of local miners formed co-operatives and leased the mines at Crosshow and Townhead from the Lowthers. They found it impossible to compete with the other wealthy coal-owners in a tight market and also had serious problems with drainage. This unique experiment ended in 1903 when both companies went into liquidation.

===Modern times===

During the early years of the 20th century, trade in the docks remained steady but was badly affected by the 1926 General Strike. Then, in 1927, a new deep-water dock was opened in Workington. Previously, the Workington Iron and Steel works had imported much of their raw material through Maryport but all of this trade was immediately transferred to the new facility. The local Solway Blast Furnaces also closed.

Maryport became a ghost town. The government declared West Cumberland a ‘Special Area&#x27; but, by 1933, 57.3% of the town&#x27;s insured workforce was unemployed. 1,684 men were out of work. Maryport was “for the most part, living on public funds”. In 1936 twenty unemployed men marched from Maryport to join the Jarrow Crusade to London. Known as the Maryport Marchers, they were joined by two marchers from Cleator Moor and two marchers from Frizington. The Maryport Marchers Council organised this.

Despite a minor boom during the Second World War, when coal from North East England was diverted to the port, Maryport never recovered. The docks were closed to cargo ships in the 1960s. The last deep pit in the area, at Risehow, closed in 1966.

Today, after a series of major regeneration projects such as the yacht marina in the local harbour, prospects for the town are starting to look better. It is expected that tourism will play a major role in the future of the town.

In October 2018, it was announced that the Netherhall School community swimming pool was to close.

==Maryport Lighthouse==
The town has a small lighthouse, formerly run by Trinity House, the general lighthouse authority for England. It is a Grade II listed building.

In 2010 Trinity House transferred responsibility for the new light to the Maryport Harbour Authority. The old lighthouse was restored and repainted in 2017 as part of a government-funded initiative for the refurbishment of seaside towns.

==Governance==
The town is part of the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and Solway, and has been represented by Markus Campbell-Savours of the Labour Party since the 2024 general election. In the December 2019 general election, the Tory candidate for Workington, Mark Jenkinson, was elected the MP, overturning a 9.4 per cent Labour majority from the 2017 election to eject shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman by a margin of 4,136 votes. Until the December 2019 general election The Labour Party has won the seat in the constituency in every general election since 1979.The Conservative Party has only been elected once in Workington since World War II, at the 1976 by-election. The town historically has been a Labour supporting area.

Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency.

For Local Government purposes it is in the Cumberland unitary authority area. From 1974 to 2023 it was in Allerdale district.

Maryport has its own parish council, Maryport Town Council.

==Economy ==
The economy of the area and the emergence of the industrial capacity of the town itself developed largely because of mining and sea trade, but these industries have since declined and the town now relies on tourism as the basis of its economy. There is an aquarium, Maryport Maritime Museum (housed in a former pub on the harbour, and established as a museum in 1975) and a Roman museum. The last houses numerous Roman artefacts, most notably a series of altars to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which were excavated in the vicinity of the Roman fort. In July 2008, a new tourism venue, the Wave Centre, opened its doors. The Wave Centre is a theatre and conference facility, an interactive heritage exhibition on the local history of Maryport, the Tourist Information Centre for Maryport and a gift shop and bistro.

The town has two industrial estates, the Glasson Industrial Estate and the Solway Industrial Estate, which are home to many small local businesses. It was formerly home to a factory belonging to the Bata company which closed in the early 1980s.
==Culture==
The town is a major name on the blues music scene, holding the &quot;Maryport Blues Festival&quot; every summer. This has previously attracted names such as Jools Holland, Dionne Warwick, Elkie Brooks, Buddy Guy, Jethro Tull, Van Morrison, Robert Cray and Chuck Berry.
The three-day event usually takes place on the last weekend of July, attracting both local and international artists. The 2018 Maryport Blues Festival was cancelled.

Maryport also holds the annual Taste of The Sea food festival where visitors can enjoy food from all over Cumbria, such as Rum Butter and Kendal Mint Cake.

The town has a Scout Group (2nd Maryport) that has been in the town for over 70 years and incorporates most sections within the Scouting Movement. The group was visited by the Bishop of Carlisle to mark the centenary of Scouting in 2008.

The town also has a Girl Guiding Group, a Young Archaeology Society, and a local wildlife conservation society. 

Maryport Golf Club, a 18-hole course, was formed on 21 January 1905.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the Caldbeck TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 95.6 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland on 102.2 FM.

<text>The A596 is a primary route in Cumbria, in northern England, that runs between Thursby ( north-east of Wigton) and Workington. For its entirety the A596 parallels the A595, and meets the A595 at both ends. The A596 begins its course at a roundabout junction with the A595 at Thursby, before continuing past the towns of Wigton and Aspatria. As it travels further towards the coast, it reaches the town of Maryport, where there is a junction to the B5300 heading up the coast to Silloth via Allonby, Mawbray, and Beckfoot. It then crosses over the River Derwent, skirting the eastern edge of Workington shortly before terminating at the junction with the A595 at Lillyhall.

==Incidents==
===November 2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods===
Workington Bridge on the A596 was closed after the November 2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods as were many other roads across the River Derwent. A temporary station, called Workington North was constructed north of the Derwent to provide access to the town to those cut off by road.

<text>The A595 is a primary route in Cumbria, in Northern England that starts in Carlisle, passes through Whitehaven and goes close to Workington, Cockermouth and Wigton. It passes Sellafield and Ravenglass before ending at the Dalton-in-Furness by-pass, in southern Cumbria, where it joins the A590 trunk road. The road is mostly single carriageway, apart from in central Carlisle, where it passes the castle as a busy dual carriageway road named Castle Way, and prior to that as Bridge Street and Church Street, where it passes close to the McVitie&#x27;s or Carr&#x27;s biscuit factory. The Lillyhall bypass is also dual carriageway.

The road in the Whitehaven area was laid out in the 1930s and the A595 was designated a trunk route in 1946. It was detrunked in 1998, apart from an section between Little Clifton and Calder Bridge. This section represents the route from Sellafield to the A66.

At Duddon Bridge and at Dove Ford near Grizebeck the road passes through farmyards.

==Route==

===Northern section===
The long A595 is also known as the Cumbrian Coast Road despite much of the road following in an inland route. Starting at the Hardwicke Circus roundabout junction with the A7 in Carlisle, it forms a short section of dual carriageway known as Castle Way. This section passes Carlisle Castle and Tullie House. Prior to the construction of Castle Way, the road was split in 2 at this section. It then continues over Caldew Bridge to a thoroughfare called Caldewgate, before arriving at a roundabout close to the McVitie&#x27;s factory in the city centre. It then follows the route of Wigton Road through the district of Morton, before reaching the outer boundary of Carlisle. At this point it passes the start point of the Carlisle Northern Development Route, where construction work commenced in 2009. This route is the A689. A further roundabout was constructed in 2011 around 1 mile south of Carlisle in anticipation of increased traffic for a nearby garden centre development.

The route continues in a south-westerly direction until it reaches a roundabout on the outskirts of Thursby at a junction with A596. The roads previously met in the centre of the village of Thursby, before the construction of the Thursby bypass in the 1980s. The A595 runs largely parallel to A596, before the A596 terminates in Workington.

The road then continues in a southerly direction, passing close to the town of Wigton. A staggered crossroads at the section provides access to Wigton and also the B5305 towards Penrith. The twin transmitters of Caldbeck and Sandale are visible close to this section of the road.

The next section follows a meandering path through several hamlets, before reaching the village of Bothel, where the A591 from Keswick terminates. The road then passes the site of the former Moota motel. Here it forms the boundary of the Lake District National Park for a little over 3 miles. This section of the route is notable for the two long straight sections, which are fairly rare on the A595. The road once again meanders until the roundabout junction with the A594 road from Cockermouth to Maryport. It then passes over the River Derwent via Papcastle Bridge before turning west and becoming the part of the A66 until Little Clifton. During the 2009 Cumbrian floods, the Papcastle bridge was briefly closed, essentially splitting West Cumbria in two. With bridge collapses and damage on the nearby A596, and a road closure on the A591, the only passable route to anywhere north of the River Derwent was via the A66 and M6 to Carlisle – a diversion of over .

At this point the road turns towards Lillyhall, passing through Lillyhall Industrial Estate and joining the Distington bypass, constructed in 2008. This section of road is notable as it is the only section of national speed limit dual carriageway along the whole length of the road. The end of the dual carriageway section is a roundabout junction near Lowca rejoining the original A595 road. It is then a short journey along the coast to the edge of Whitehaven.

===Southern section===
The road passes through Loop Road North &amp; Loop Road South in Whitehaven passing the suburbs of the Highlands, Hill Crest and Hensingham. It forms the Hensingham bypass at this section, constructed in the 1980s to ease the passage of construction traffic to Sellafield through a particularly narrow and busy section of the road. It then passes close to West Cumberland Hospital and West Lakes Science &amp; Technology Park. There is a campaign to build a bypass from the recently built Distington Bypass to this part of the A595 to ease congestion in the Whitehaven area.

After this, the road the passes near to Moor Row and through the centre of Bigrigg, before heading downhill to Egremont. The northbound side of the road here was upgraded in the 1980s to provide an extra uphill lane for overtaking due to the steep gradient. At the bottom of the hill the roundabout forms a junction with the B5086 which gives access to Cleator Moor and eventually Cockermouth.

The A595 the forms the Egremont bypass. This bypass was built in the early &#x27;90s as a result of an investment by BNFL in local infrastructure following the siting of the THORP reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Prior to the bypass, the A595 originally passed right through the middle of town of Egremont. Once past the village of Thornhill, the sprawling Sellafield nuclear site is visible. Twin cooling towers previously dominated the skyline here, however they were demolished in 2007.

The road then passes Beckermet and Calder Bridge, junctions here give access to the Sellafield site. From Calder Bridge, the A595 forms the boundary of the Lake District National Park, going between the villages of Seascale and Gosforth. It enters the national park at the bridge over the River Irt at Holmrook and continues past the village of Ravenglass, then passes through over the River Esk at Hinning House bridge before passing through the villages of Waberthwaite and Bootle and round the foot of Black Combe.

At Whicham the road has a TOTSO (turn off to stay on) junction with the A5093, close to the town of Millom, taking a north-easterly route along Whicham Valley. For much of this stretch, the road is close to or is the boundary of the Lake District National Park. At Duddon Bridge, the road crosses the river Duddon which previously marked the boundary of the historic county of Cumberland and Lancashire. The road then turns towards Broughton-in-Furness and used to go through it but now diverts via Foxfield before turning north to rejoin its old route, then once again turning south. At Grizebeck, the A5092 then branches off the road to connect with the A590 forming another TOTSO. This is also the point at which the A595 ceases to be the boundary to the Lake District National Park.

The road finally passes through Kirkby-in-Furness, Ireleth and Askam-in-Furness before terminating further south at Elliscales roundabout where it crosses the Dalton bypass A590.

The last section of the road is particularly narrow and even passes through a farmyard, though plans have been approved to bypass this with the original road anticipated to become private access. 

==Safety==

The road, along with the A66, is considered to be the most dangerous road in Cumbria, and has several accident blackspots. The stretch through Moota is regularly the scene of fatal accidents. The northern section was formerly a trunk road, but until the recent completion of the Distington Bypass it had only one small section of dual carriageway. The southern section of the road around New Mill does not have a secondary route. When this section is closed due to an accident or roadworks, the detour routes are via Wrynose and Hardknott mountain passes for cars, and via the M6 J40 for HGVs, the latter being a detour of . The poor safety record of the road is highlighted by signs erected on the route stating &quot;1245 casualties in 5 years&quot;.

==Road schemes==

===Carlisle Northern Development Route (A689)===
The Carlisle Northern Development Route (CNDR) is a long north-western bypass of Carlisle, which replaced the main road through the city (Wigton Road, Church Street, Bridge Street and Castle Way) and diverted traffic from the city&#x27;s roads. The road is single carriageway, with a number of roundabout junctions, as well as a new bridge over the River Eden. The route begins near Newby West (to the west of the city), before meeting the B5307 (the road to Abbeytown). Shortly afterwards it crosses over the River Eden, and curves round to the north of the Kingstown Industrial Estate, and terminates at Junction 44 of the M6 motorway.

The development of the route suffered several setbacks. In August 2008 a discovery of a great crested newt colony led to a delay in the start of the project. In February 2009 a potentially important Stone Age find was discovered during surveying work. The most serious problem to face the development was the near collapse of the bank providing the funds under a private finance initiative. Belgian bank Dexia was involved in a £5 billion bailout during the Credit Crunch. A consortium of banks later stepped in to provide the funding, and construction got underway.
The bypass opened in Spring 2012.

===Parton to Lillyhall improvements===

The Parton to Lillyhall bypass was opened in December 2008 after a period of 18 months construction. The road runs from the junction with the A596 at Lillyhall to a new junction created close to the A595 junction for Lowca. The new road replaces a winding, narrow section of the A595 which passed through the village of Distington. Prior to this project the A595 was considered for de-trunking, meaning the scheme would have become the responsibility of Cumbria County Council. However, it was not de-trunked, and has instead been listed in the government&#x27;s Targeted Programme of Improvements.

===Whitehaven Eastern Relief Road===

Copeland MP Jamie Reed and Cumbria County Council leader Stewart Young have been pressing the UK government for an eastern relief road to take the A595 away from a bottleneck through the town of Whitehaven. The proposed route would connect with recent Parton to Lillyhall bypass, it would then pass to the east of the town, past the newly proposed replacement for West Cumberland Hospital, then finally passing West Lakes Science &amp; Technology Park before joining the current A595 south of Whitehaven. Plans are being drawn up as part of the Energy Coast masterplan to regenerate West Cumbria.

<text>The A4W reactor is a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to propel warships and generate onboard electricity. 

The A4W designation stands for:

* A = Aircraft carrier platform
* 4 = Contractor&#x27;s fourth core design generation
* W = Westinghouse, the contracted designer

== History ==
These nuclear fission pressurized water reactors (PWRs) were jointly designed by Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory and Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory and built by Westinghouse Electric Company. Their reactor cores are expected to operate for about 25 years before refueling is required. The only ships to use these nuclear reactors are the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class supercarriers, which have two reactors rated at 550 MWth each. These generate enough steam to produce 140,000 shaft horsepower (104 MW) for each pair of the ship&#x27;s four shafts – two per propulsion plant – plus approximately 100 MW of electricity.

<doc id="520591" wikidata="Q267753" url="?curid=520591" title="Retroflex consonant">
<text>A retroflex (), apico-domal, or cacuminal () consonant is a coronal consonant where the tongue has a flat, concave, or even curled shape, and is articulated between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate. They are sometimes referred to as cerebral consonants—especially in Indology.

The Latin-derived word &quot;retroflex&quot; means &quot;bent back&quot;; some retroflex consonants are pronounced with the tongue fully curled back so that articulation involves the underside of the tongue tip (subapical). These sounds are sometimes described as &quot;true&quot; retroflex consonants. However, retroflexes are commonly taken to include other consonants having a similar place of articulation without such extreme curling of the tongue; these may be articulated with the tongue tip (apical) or the tongue blade (laminal).

==Types==
Retroflex consonants, like other coronal consonants, come in several varieties, depending on the shape of the tongue. The tongue may be either flat or concave, or even with the tip curled back. The point of contact on the tongue may be with the tip (), with the blade (), or with the underside of the tongue (). The point of contact on the roof of the mouth may be with the alveolar ridge (), the area behind the alveolar ridge (), or the hard palate (). Finally, both sibilant ( or ) and nonsibilant (, , , ) consonants can have a retroflex articulation.

The greatest variety of combinations occurs with sibilants, because for them, small changes in tongue shape and position cause significant changes in the resulting sound. Retroflex sounds generally have a duller, lower-pitched sound than other alveolar or postalveolar consonants, especially the sibilants. The farther back the point of contact with the roof of the mouth, the more concave is the shape of the tongue, and the duller (lower pitched) is the sound, with subapical consonants being the most extreme.

The main combinations normally observed are:
*Laminal post-alveolar, with a flat tongue. These occur, for example, in Polish &quot;cz, sz, ż (rz), dż&quot;.
*Apical post-alveolar, with a somewhat concave tongue. These occur, for example, in Mandarin &quot;zh, ch, sh, r&quot;, Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages.
*Subapical palatal, with a highly concave tongue, which occur particularly in the Dravidian languages and some Indo-Aryan languages. They are the dullest and lowest-pitched type and, after a vowel, often add strong &quot;r&quot;-coloring to the vowel and sound as if an American English &quot;r&quot; occurred between the vowel and consonant. They are not a place of articulation, as the IPA chart implies, but a shape of the tongue analogous to laminal and apical.
Subapical sounds are sometimes called &quot;true retroflex&quot; because of the curled-back shape of the tongue, and the other sounds sometimes go by other names. For example, Ladefoged and Maddieson prefer to call the laminal post-alveolar sounds &quot;flat post-alveolar&quot;.

===Other sounds===
Retroflex sounds must be distinguished from other consonants made in the same parts of the mouth:
*the palato-alveolar consonants (e.g., ), such as the &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;zh&quot; occurring in English words like &quot;ship&quot;, &quot;chip&quot; and &quot;vision&quot;
*the alveolo-palatal consonants (e.g., ), such as the &quot;j, q&quot; and &quot;x&quot; occurring in Mandarin Chinese
*the dorsal palatal consonants (e.g., ), such as the &quot;ch&quot; in German &quot;ich&quot; or the &quot;ñ&quot; in Spanish &quot;año&quot;
*the grooved alveolar consonants (e.g., ), such as the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; occurring in English words like &quot;sip&quot; and &quot;zip&quot;

The first three types of sounds above have a convex tongue shape, which gives them an additional secondary articulation of palatalization. The last type has a groove running down the center line of the tongue, which gives it a strong hissing quality. The retroflex sounds, however, have a flat or concave shape, with no associated palatalization, and no groove running down the tongue. The term &quot;retroflex&quot;, in fact, literally means &quot;bent back&quot; (concave), although consonants with a flat tongue shape are commonly considered retroflex as well.

The velar bunched approximant found in northern varieties of Dutch and some varieties of American English is acoustically similar to the retroflex approximant. It is articulated with the body of the tongue bunched up at the velum.

==Transcription==
===IPA transcription===
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the symbols for retroflex consonants are typically the same as for the alveolar consonants, but with the addition of a right-facing hook to the bottom of the symbol.

Retroflex consonants are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet as follows:

===Other conventions===
Some linguists restrict these symbols for consonants with subapical palatal articulation, in which the tongue is curled back and contacts the hard palate, and use the alveolar symbols with the obsolete IPA underdot symbol for an apical post-alveolar articulation: , and use for laminal retroflex, as in Polish and Russian. The latter are also often transcribed with a retraction diacritic, as . Otherwise they are typically but inaccurately transcribed as if they were palato-alveolar, as .

Consonants with more forward articulation, in which the tongue touches the alveolar or postalveolar region rather than the hard palate, can be indicated with the retracted diacritic (minus sign below). This occurs especially for ; other sounds indicated this way, such as , tend to refer to alveolo-palatal rather than retroflex consonants.

==Occurrence==
Although data are not precise, about 20 percent of the world&#x27;s languages contain retroflex consonants of one sort or another. About half of these possess only retroflex continuants, with most of the rest having both stops and continuants.

Retroflex consonants are concentrated in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages, but are found in other languages of the region as well, such as the Munda languages and Burushaski. 

The Nuristani languages of eastern Afghanistan also have retroflex consonants. Among Eastern Iranian languages, they are common in Pashto, Wakhi, Sanglechi-Ishkashimi, and Munji-Yidgha. They also occur in some other Asian languages such as Mandarin Chinese, Javanese and Vietnamese. 

The other major concentration is in the indigenous languages of Australia and the Western Pacific (notably New Caledonia). Here, most languages have retroflex plosives, nasals and approximants.

Retroflex consonants are relatively rare in the European languages but occur in such languages as Swedish and Norwegian in Northern Europe, some Romance languages of Southern Europe (Sardinian, Sicilian, including Calabrian and Salentino, some Italian dialects such as Lunigianese in Italy, and some Asturian dialects in Spain), and (sibilants only) Faroese and several Slavic languages (Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak and Sorbian). In Swedish and Norwegian, a sequence of &quot;r&quot; and a coronal consonant may be replaced by the coronal&#x27;s retroflex equivalent: the name &quot;Martin&quot; is pronounced (Swedish) or (Norwegian), and &quot;nord&quot; (&quot;north&quot;) is pronounced in (Standard) Swedish and in many varieties of Norwegian. That is sometimes done for several consonants in a row after an &quot;r&quot;: Hornstull is pronounced ).

The retroflex approximant is in free variation with the postalveolar approximant in many dialects of American English, particularly in the Midwestern United States. Polish and Russian possess retroflex sibilants, but no stops or liquids at this place of articulation.

Retroflex consonants are largely absent from indigenous languages of the Americas with the exception of the extreme south of South America, an area in the Southwestern United States as in Hopi and O&#x27;odham, and in Alaska and the Yukon Territory as in the Athabaskan languages Gwich’in and Hän. In African languages retroflex consonants are also rare but reportedly occur in a few Nilo-Saharan languages, as well as in the Bantu language Makhuwa and some other varieties. In southwest Ethiopia, phonemically distinctive retroflex consonants are found in Bench and Sheko, two contiguous, but not closely related, Omotic languages.

There are several retroflex consonants that are implied by the International Phonetic Association. In their &quot;Handbook&quot;, they give the example of , a retroflex implosive, but when they requested an expansion of coverage of the International Phonetic Alphabet by Unicode in 2020, they supported the addition superscript variants of not just but of the retroflex lateral fricatives and , of the retroflex lateral flap , and of the retroflex click release . (See Latin Extended-F.) The lateral fricatives are explicitly provided for by extIPA. 

Most of these sounds are not common, but they all occur. For example, the Iwaidja language of northern Australia has a retroflex lateral flap () as well as a retroflex tap and retroflex lateral approximant ; and the Dravidian language Toda has a subapical retroflex lateral fricative () and a retroflexed trill . The Ngad&#x27;a language of Flores has been reported to have a retroflex implosive . Subapical retroflex clicks occur in Central !Kung, and possibly in Damin.

Most languages with retroflex sounds typically have only one retroflex sound with a given manner of articulation. An exception, however, is the Toda language, with a two-way distinction among retroflex sibilants between apical (post)alveolar and subapical palatal.

<text>A percussion mallet or beater is an object used to strike or beat a percussion instrument to produce its sound.

The term beater is slightly more general. A mallet is normally held in the hand while a beater may be a foot or mechanically operated, for example in a bass drum pedal. The term drum stick is less general still but still applied to a wide range of beaters. Some mallets, such as a triangle beater, are normally used only with a specific instrument, while others are used on many different instruments. Often, mallets of differing material and hardness are used to create different timbres on the same types of instrument (e.g. using either wooden or yarn mallets on a xylophone).

Some mallets, such as vibraphone mallets, are normally just called mallets, others have more specialized names including:

* Drum sticks, of many types, some used with a wide variety of instruments.
* Rutes, used with many instruments.
* Brushes, used particularly with snare drum but also with many other instruments.
* Tippers used to strike a bodhrán. 
* Bachi, used with Japanese taiko drums.
* Hammers, used to strike tubular bells

==Types==

===Drum sticks===
Drum sticks are beaters normally used in pairs, with each held in one hand, and are similar to or derived from the snare drum sticks that were subsequently adopted for kit drumming.

They are the most general-purpose beaters, and the term covers a wide variety of beaters, but they are mainly used for untuned percussion.
===Mallets===
As well as being a general term for a hand-held beater, mallet is also used specifically to refer to a hand-held beater comprising a head connected to a thin shaft, and used in pairs. There is a wide selection of mallets to choose from to create a desired sound, articulation, character, and dynamic for the pieces being played. Professional percussionists typically have a good selection of mallets on hand to be prepared for each piece. 
There are three main types:

* Unwrapped mallets, used on glockenspiel, xylophone, and other instruments with keys made of durable material, have heads made of brass, rubber, nylon, acrylic, wood, or other hard materials. 
* Wrapped mallets, mostly used on marimba, vibraphone, and other instruments with softer keys (though they can be used on more durable instruments as well), have heads of kelon, rubber, nylon, acrylic, or other medium-hard materials wrapped in softer materials like yarn, cord or latex. Wrapped mallets are also the mallets of choice to play suspended cymbal, though drum set players will typically use drum sticks instead.
* Felt mallets or cartwheel mallets have heads composed of layers of felt, held between two steel washers. They are mainly used on untuned percussion as well as on timpani.

Mallet shafts are commonly made of rattan, birch, or synthetic materials such as fibreglass. Birch is stiff and typically longer, while rattan is a more flexible shaft and gives a more open sound. Fiberglass is ideal for playing lightly on an instrument because it is easy to control.

Different mallets are used primarily to alter the timbre of the mallet instrument being played. Generally, mallets composed of softer materials will stick to the instrument for longer as they bounce off of it, which gives a deeper sound made up of lower frequencies. Harder materials tend to bounce off quicker, and as they stick to the instrument for a shorter amount of time, they tend to be able to excite more of the higher frequencies, giving the sound a higher pitch with more overtones. Mallet&#x27;s choice is typically left up to the performer, though some compositions specify if a certain sound is desired by the composer. 

Players frequently employ two mallets in a matched grip or four mallets in a four-mallet grip; however, the use of up to six mallets is not uncommon. More than two mallets may be used even when no chords are called for by the composer so that the performer has a wider range of timbres from which to select or to facilitate the performance of music that moves rapidly between high and low, and if hit properly can switch between the two pitches.

If the mallet is too hard, the instrument may be damaged. For example, on rosewood marimbas, certain mallets may be too hard, increasing the risk of a cracked bar. 

===Brushes===
Brushes are a set of bristles connected to a handle so that the bristles make a rounded fan shape. They are often used in jazz or blues music, but also in other genres such as rock, country, and pop. The bristles can be made of metal or plastic; the handles are commonly made of wood or aluminum and are often coated with rubber. Some brushes are telescoping so that the bristles can be pulled inside a hollow handle and the fan made by the bristles can be of variable length, width, and density. Retracting the bristles also protects the brush when it is not being used. The non-bristled end of the brush may end in a loop or a ball.

===Rutes===

A route or multi-rod consists of several thin sticks that are bound together to form one stick. Its sound is midway between a stick and a brush.

Long used in orchestral music, in the mid-20th century routes also became popular for many other purposes including kit drumming and bodhrán.

By dissipating much of the energy of the stroke within the stick, a route allows a drummer to achieve both a tone and a playing action that would normally be associated with a quite loud playing, but at a moderate or even low volume. The tone produced by many can be adjusted by adjusting the position of one of the bands holding the bundle together.

<doc id="520599" wikidata="Q5365075" url="?curid=520599" title="Willie Brown (politician)">
<text>Willie Lewis Brown Jr. (born March 20, 1934) is an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004 as the first African American to hold the office.

Born in Mineola, Texas, where he graduated from high school, Brown moved to San Francisco in 1951. He graduated from San Francisco State University in 1955 and earned a J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1958, after which he worked as an attorney and was involved in the civil rights movement. He was elected to the California Assembly in 1964, during which he became popular in San Francisco and became known as one of the country&#x27;s most powerful state legislators. As a legislator, Brown earned a reputation as a supporter of civil rights of gays and lesbians and was able to manage colleagues and maintain party discipline. He served as the speaker of the California State Assembly from 1980 to 1995. His long tenure and powerful position were used as a focal point of the California ballot proposition limiting the terms of state legislators that passed in 1990. During the last of his three allowed post-initiative terms, Brown maintained control of the Assembly despite a slim Republican majority. Near the end of his final term, he decided to run for mayor of San Francisco.

During Brown&#x27;s tenure as mayor of San Francisco, the city&#x27;s budget was expanded, and real estate development, public works, city beautification, and other city projects saw a significant increase. Brown presided over the &quot;dot-com&quot; era at a time when San Francisco&#x27;s economy was rapidly expanding. His administration included more Asian-Americans, women, Latinos, gays and African Americans than the administrations of his predecessors. Brown was reelected in 1999, but term limits prevented him from running for a third term, and he was succeeded by his political protégé Gavin Newsom. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called Brown &quot;one of San Francisco&#x27;s most notable mayors&quot;, adding that he had &quot;celebrity beyond the city&#x27;s boundaries.&quot; He retired from politics after leaving the office in 2004, published an autobiography, and continued to fundraise and advise politicians.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Brown was born on March 20, 1934, in Mineola, a small segregated town in East Texas marked by racial tensions, to Minnie Collins Boyd and Lewis Brown. He was the fourth of five children. During Brown&#x27;s childhood, mob violence periodically erupted in Mineola, keeping African-Americans from voting. His first job was as a shoeshine boy in a whites-only barber shop. He later worked as a janitor, fry cook and field hand. He learned his strong work ethic at a young age from his grandmother. He graduated from Mineola Colored High School, which he later described as substandard, and left for San Francisco in August 1951 at the age of 17 to live with his uncle.

Although Brown did not meet the qualifications for San Francisco State College, a professor at the school facilitated his admission on probation. Brown adjusted to college studies by working especially hard to catch up in his first semester. He joined the Young Democrats and became friends with John L. Burton. Brown originally wanted to be a math instructor but campus politics changed his ambitions. He became active in his church and the San Francisco NAACP. Brown worked as a doorman, janitor and shoe salesman to pay for college. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He also joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) but later quit the ROTC and joined the California Army National Guard&#x27;s 126th Medical Battalion, where he was trained as a dental hygienist. Brown earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from San Francisco State in 1955.

Brown attended University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he also worked as a janitor. He later said that his decision to attend law school was primarily to avoid being drafted. He befriended future San Francisco mayor George Moscone, for whom Brown later managed a campaign.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Brown was one of a few African-Americans practicing law in San Francisco when he opened his own business. He practiced criminal defense law, representing pimps, prostitutes and other clients that more prominent attorneys would not represent. One early case was to defend Mario Savio on his first civil disobedience arrest. He quickly became involved in the Civil Rights Movement, leading a well-orchestrated sit-in to protest housing discrimination after a local real estate office refused to work with him because of his race.

Brown began his first run for the California State Assembly in 1962 by having local African American ministers pass around a hat, collecting $700. He lost the election by 600 votes before winning a second election in 1964.

==California State Assembly==

Brown was one of four Black Americans in the Assembly in 1965. The other three were Mervyn M. Dymally, F. Douglas Ferrell and Byron Rumford. He continued to be reelected to the Assembly until 1995. In the 1960s, Brown served as chair of the Legislative Representation Committee, a powerful position that helped him climb the Assembly ranks. He became the Democrats&#x27; Assembly whip in 1969. Brown also served on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. In 1972, he delivered a speech at the Democratic National Convention. He lost his bid for the speakership in 1972. In 1975, Brown authored and lobbied the successful passing of the Consenting Adult Sex Bill that legalized homosexuality in California, thus earning the strong and lasting support of San Francisco&#x27;s gay community. Similarly, he voted against AB 607, which banned same-sex marriage in 1977, further building his reputation as a supporter of the civil rights of gays and lesbians. During the 1970s, Brown continued to expand his legal practice, including the representation of several major real estate developers. He won the Speakership in 1980.

Brown was California&#x27;s first Black American speaker of the Assembly, and served in the office from 1981 to 1995. In 1990, he helped negotiate an end to a 64-day budget standoff. In 1994, Brown gained the vote of a few Republicans to maintain the Speakership when the Democrats lost control of the Assembly to the Republicans led by Jim Brulte. Brown regained control in 1995 by making a deal with Republican defectors Doris Allen and Brian Setencich, both of whom were elected speaker by the Democratic minority.

Brown&#x27;s long service in the Assembly and political connections, his strong negotiation skills, and the Assembly&#x27;s tenure system for leadership appointments combined to give Brown nearly complete control over the California legislature by the time he became Assembly Speaker. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brown became one of the country&#x27;s most powerful state legislators. He nicknamed himself the &quot;Ayatollah of the Assembly&quot;.

Brown was extremely popular in San Francisco, but less so in the rest of the state. Nevertheless, he wielded great control over statewide legislative affairs and political appointments, making it difficult for his conservative opponents to thwart his power. Partially to remove Brown from his leadership position, a state constitutional amendment initiative was proposed and passed by the electorate in 1990, imposing term limits on state legislators. Brown became the focus of the initiative, and raised just under $1 million to defeat it. The California legislature challenged the law, but the courts upheld it. California Proposition 140 also cut the legislature&#x27;s staff budget by 30 percent, causing Brown to reduce legislative staff by at least 600. Under current California term-limits law, no speaker of the California State Assembly is able to have a longer tenure than Brown&#x27;s.

Brown gained a reputation for knowing what was occurring in the state legislature at all times. In 1992, he gave $1.18 million to the Democratic Party to help with voter registration and several campaigns, some of which was from contributions from tobacco companies and insurance companies. As Speaker, he worked to defeat the Three Strikes Law. Critics have claimed Brown did not do enough to raise the legislature&#x27;s ethical standards or to protect the environment. During his time in Sacramento, he estimates he raised close to $75 million to help elect and reelect state Democrats.

Brown led efforts in the Assembly for state universities to divest from South Africa and to increase AIDS research funding. He helped obtain state funds for San Francisco, including funding for public health and mental health funds. Brown held up the 1992 state budget for 63 days until Governor Pete Wilson added another $1.1 billion for public schools.

Brown had a reputation in the Assembly for his ability to manage people. Republican State Senator Ken Maddy of Fresno noted Brown&#x27;s ability to &quot;size up the situation and create, sometimes on the spot, a winning strategy.&quot; According to Hobson, &quot;He was a brilliant daycare operator. ... He knew exactly how to hold the hand of his Assembly members. He dominated California politics like no other politician in the history of the state&quot;.

===Peoples Temple===

From 1975 to 1978, Brown supported the Peoples Temple, led by Jim Jones, while it was being investigated for alleged criminal wrongdoing. Brown attended the Temple perhaps a dozen times and served as master of ceremonies at a testimonial dinner for Jones where he said in his introduction, &quot;[l]et me present to you a combination of Martin King, Angela Davis, Albert Einstein ... Chairman Mao.&quot;

==Mayor of San Francisco==
In 1995, Brown ran for mayor of San Francisco. In his announcement speech, he said San Francisco needed a &quot;resurrection&quot; and that he would bring the &quot;risk-taking leadership&quot; the city needed. Brown placed first in the first round of voting, but because no candidate received 50% of the vote, he faced incumbent Frank Jordan in the December runoff. Brown gained the support of Supervisor Roberta Achtenberg, who had placed third in the first round of voting. He campaigned on working to address poverty and problems with Muni. He called Jordan the &quot;inept bumbler&quot; and criticized his leadership. Jordan criticized Brown for his relations with special interests during his time in the State Assembly. Brown easily defeated Jordan.

Brown&#x27;s inaugural celebration included an open invitation party with 10,000 attendees and local restaurants providing 10,000 meals to the homeless. President Bill Clinton called Brown to congratulate him, and the congratulations were broadcast to the crowd. He delivered his inaugural address without notes and led the orchestra in &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. He arrived at the event in a horse-drawn carriage.

In 1996, more than two-thirds of San Franciscans approved of Brown&#x27;s job performance. As mayor, he made several appearances on national talk shows. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. In 1999, he proposed hiring 1,392 new city workers and proposed a second straight budget with a $100 million surplus. He helped oversee the settling of a two-day garbage strike in April 1997. During Brown&#x27;s tenure, San Francisco&#x27;s budget increased to $5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. Brown tried to develop a plan for universal health care, but there wasn&#x27;t enough in the budget to do so. He put in long days as mayor, scheduling days of solid meetings and, at times, conducting two meetings at the same time. Brown opened City Hall on Saturdays to answer questions. He would later claim of his mayorship that he helped restore the city&#x27;s spirit and pride.

Brown&#x27;s opponents in his 1999 mayoral reelection campaign were former mayor Jordan and Clint Reilly. They criticized Brown for spending the city&#x27;s $1 billion in budget growth without addressing its major problems and creating an environment of corruption and patronage at City Hall. Tom Ammiano was a late write-in candidate and faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20-point margin. Most major developers and business interests supported him. Ammiano campaigned on a promise that he would raise the hourly minimum wage to $11 and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown&#x27;s behalf. Brown&#x27;s campaign spent $3.1 million to Ammiano&#x27;s $300,000. The 1999 mayoral race was the subject of the documentary &quot;See How They Run&quot;.

===Crime and public safety===
According to Brown, although he was scheduled for a flight to New York City on the day of the September 11, 2001 attacks, he received a &quot;low key warning&quot; in a phone call from a member of his airport security detail, who advised him not to fly. Brown disregarded the warning and was waiting for a ride to the airport for an 8 a.m. Pacific Time flight, when he learned of the attacks. He immediately ordered the city to close schools and courts, concerned over the potential for additional terrorist attacks. In addition, he recommended to representatives of other possible targets in San Francisco, including the Bank of America Tower and Transamerica Pyramid, that they also close.

In February 2003, Brown&#x27;s appointed police chief, Earl Sanders, and several top San Francisco Police Department officials were arrested for conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into an incident involving off-duty officers popularly called &quot;Fajitagate&quot;.

===Social policy===
Brown ended San Francisco&#x27;s policy of punishing people for feeding the homeless. San Francisco continued to enforce its policy regarding the conduct of the homeless in public places. In 1998, Brown supported forcibly removing homeless people from Golden Gate Park and police crackdowns on the homeless for drunkenness, urinating, defecating, or sleeping on the sidewalk. Brown introduced job training programs and a $11 million drug treatment program. San Francisco, the country&#x27;s 13th-largest city at the time, had the nation&#x27;s third-largest homeless population, at a peak of 16,000. In November 1997, Brown requested nighttime helicopter searches in Golden Gate Park. His administration spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating new shelters, supportive housing, and drug treatment centers to address homelessness, but these measures did not end homelessness.

In 1996, Brown approved the Equal Benefits Ordinance, which required city contractors to give their employees domestic partner benefits. In 1998, he wrote President Clinton a letter urging him to halt a federal lawsuit aimed at closing medical marijuana clubs.

===Transportation===

====Mass transit====
One of Brown&#x27;s central campaign promises was his &quot;100-Day Plan for Muni&quot;, in which he said he would fix the city&#x27;s municipal bus system in that many days. Brown supported the &quot;Peer Pressure&quot; Bus Patrol program, which paid former gang members and troubled youth to patrol Muni buses. He claimed the program helped reduce crime. He fired Muni chief Phil Adams and replaced him with his chief of staff Emilio Cruz. In 1998, Brown was mayor during the summer of the Muni meltdown as Muni implemented the new ATC system and he promised riders there would be better times ahead. A voter-approved initiative the next year helped improve Muni services. Brown increased Muni&#x27;s budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure. He later said he made a mistake in overpromising with his 100-Day Plan.

Brown helped mediate a settlement to the 1997 BART strike.

During his first term as mayor, Brown quietly favored the demolition and abolition of the Transbay Terminal to accommodate the redevelopment of the site for market-rate housing. Centrally located at First and Mission Streets near the Financial District and South Beach, the terminal originally served as the San Francisco terminus for the electric commuter trains of the East Bay Electric Lines, the Key System of streetcars and the Sacramento Northern railroads which ran on the lower deck of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. Since the termination of streetcar service in 1958, the terminal had seen continuous service as a major bus facility for East Bay commuters; AC Transit buses transport riders from the terminal directly into neighborhoods throughout the inner East Bay. The terminal also served passengers traveling to San Mateo County and the North Bay aboard SamTrans and Golden Gate Transit buses respectively, and tourists arriving by bus motorcoach. The Transbay Terminal ultimately was replaced by the Salesforce Transit Center, as the land was used to construct Salesforce Tower.

====Critical Mass====
Since 1992, cyclists riding in San Francisco&#x27;s monthly Critical Mass bicycle rides had used the &quot;corking&quot; technique at street intersections to block rush-hour cross-traffic. In 1997, Brown approved San Francisco Police Department Chief Fred Lau&#x27;s plan to crack down on the rides, calling them &quot;a terrible demonstration of intolerance&quot; and &quot;an incredible display of arrogance.&quot; After arrests were made when a Critical Mass event became violent, Brown said, &quot;I think we ought to confiscate their bicycles&quot; and &quot;a little jail time&quot; would teach Critical Mass riders a lesson. On the night of the July 25, 1997, ride, 115 riders were arrested for unlawful assembly, jailed, and had their bicycles confiscated.

By 2002, Brown and the city&#x27;s relations with Critical Mass had changed. On the 10th anniversary of Critical Mass on September 27, 2002, the city officially closed down four blocks to automobile traffic for the annual Car-Free Day Street Fair. Brown said of the event, &quot;I&#x27;m delighted. A new tradition has been born in our city.&quot;

===Urban planning and development===
As mayor, Brown was criticized for aggregating power and favoring certain business interests at the city&#x27;s expense as a whole. Supporters point to the many development projects completed or planned under his watch, including the restoration of City Hall and historic waterfront buildings; the setting in motion of one of the city&#x27;s largest ever mixed-use development projects in Mission Bay, and the development of a second campus for the University of California, San Francisco. In contrast, critics objected to the construction of many live-work loft buildings in formerly working-class neighborhoods that they believed led to gentrification and displacement of residents and light industry.

Under Brown, City Hall was restored from damages sustained during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. He insisted on restoring the light courts and having the dome gilded with more than $400,000 in real gold. The Embarcadero was redeveloped and the Mission Bay Development project began. Brown also oversaw the approval of the Catellus Development Corp., a $100 million restoration of the century-old Ferry Building, the new Asian Art Museum, the new M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center and San Francisco International Airport&#x27;s new international terminal. Brown worked to restructure the Housing Authority. He helped established an AFL-CIO housing trust to build affordable housing and worked to increase the city&#x27;s share of federal and state grants. He oversaw declining crime rates and improvements in the city&#x27;s economy, finances, and credit ratings during his first term.

Brown was known for his shrewd and strategic use of the planning process&#x27;s details to affect and facilitate development projects on his watch. In regard to a parking garage on Vallejo Street desired by North Beach and Chinatown merchants, he circumvented neighborhood opponents of the garage by ordering demolition of the site&#x27;s existing structure to commence on a Friday night and be done by Monday morning, when the group was certain to try to obtain a restraining order. &quot;It was with the demolition permit I outsmarted them&quot;, Brown said, claiming that as the critics rushed toward court, &quot;someone shouted out to them that the building had disappeared over the weekend. They&#x27;ve never recovered from that little maneuver.&quot;

During his mayoralty, Brown hoped to build a new stadium for the San Francisco 49ers and worked with them to create a plan. No new facility was built for the team during his tenure. Brown worked with the San Francisco Giants to build a new stadium in the China Basin after previous stadium measures had failed on the ballot. The stadium was approved by San Francisco voters in June 1997 and opened in 2000.

Due to vacancies on the Board of Supervisors before 2000, Brown was able to appoint eight of the board&#x27;s 11 members. Due to a change in San Francisco&#x27;s election laws that took effect in 2000, the board changed from at-large to district-based elections, and all seats on the board were up for election. The voters elected a new group of supervisors that ran on changing the city&#x27;s development policy. Voters also passed a measure that weakened the mayor&#x27;s control over the Planning Commission and Board of Appeals. The new majority limited Brown&#x27;s power over the Elections Department, the Police Commission, and extending San Francisco International Airport&#x27;s runways into the bay to reduce flight delays.

==Favoritism, patronage criticisms, and FBI investigations==
Allegations of political patronage followed Brown from the state legislature through his mayoralty. Former Los Angeles County GOP assemblyman Paul Horcher, who voted in 1994 to keep Brown as speaker, was reassigned to a position with a six-figure salary as head of San Francisco&#x27;s solid waste management program. Brian Setencich was also appointed to a position by Brown. Both were hired as special assistants after losing their Assembly seats because they supported Brown. Former San Francisco supervisor Bill Maher was also hired as a special assistant after campaigning for Brown in his first mayoral race. Brown is also accused of favoritism to Carolyn Carpeneti, a philanthropic fundraiser with whom he had a child. In 1998 Brown arranged for Carpeneti to obtain a rent-free office in the city-owned Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Between then and 2003, a period that included the birth of their daughter, Carpeneti was paid an estimated $2.33 million by nonprofit groups and political committees, though not all this money went directly to Carpeneti.

Brown increased the city&#x27;s special assistants payroll from $15.6 to $45.6 million between 1995 and 2001. Between April 29, and May 3, 2001, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporters Lance Williams and Chuck Finnie released a five-part story on Brown and his relations with city contractors, lobbyists, and city appointments and hires he had made during his mayoralty. The report concluded that there was an appearance of favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on City Hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, and friends to government positions.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated Brown when he was speaker. One investigation was a sting operation concerning a fake fish company attempting to bribe Brown; he was not charged with a crime. The FBI further investigated Brown from 1998 to 2003 over his appointees at the Airport Commission for potential conflicts of interests. Brown&#x27;s friend, contributor, and former law client Charlie Walker was given a share of city contracts. Walker had previously thrown several parties for Brown and was among his biggest fundraisers. He had served jail time in 1984 for violating laws concerning minority contracting. The FBI investigated Walker. The FBI also investigated Brown&#x27;s approval of expansion of Sutro Tower and SFO. Scott Company, with one prominent Brown backer, was accused of using a phony minority front company to secure an airport construction project. Robert Nurisso was sentenced to house arrest. During Brown&#x27;s administration, there were two convictions of city officials tied to Brown. Brown reassigned Parking and Traffic chief Bill Maher to an airport job when his critics claimed Maher should have been fired. Brown also put his former girlfriend Wendy Linka on the city payroll.

Brown&#x27;s romantic relationship with Alameda County deputy district attorney Kamala Harris preceded his appointment of Harris to two California state commissions in the mid-1990s. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the California Medical Assistance Commission patronage positions. When the appointments became a political issue in Harris&#x27;s 2003 race for District Attorney, she responded: &quot;Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work&quot;. Brown&#x27;s relationship with Harris gained renewed attention in early 2019 after she had become a U.S. senator and ran for president. Brown addressed the questions by publishing a piece in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; titled &quot;Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?&quot; He wrote that he may have &quot;influenced&quot; her career by appointing her to boards and supporting her run for District Attorney, but added that he had also influenced the careers of other politicians. Brown noted that the difference between Harris and other politicians he had helped was that &quot;Harris is the only one who, after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I &#x27;so much as jaywalked&#x27; while she was D.A. That&#x27;s politics for ya.&quot;

==After mayorship==

After leaving the mayor&#x27;s office, Brown considered running for the State Senate but ultimately declined. From January through September 2006, he hosted a morning radio show with comedian Will Durst on a local San Francisco Air America Radio affiliate. He also does a weekly podcast. Brown established The Willie L. Brown Jr. Institute on Politics &amp; Public Service, an unaffiliated nonprofit organization at San Francisco State University. It trains students for careers in municipal, county and regional governments. The center will be one of the first to focus on local government in the country. Brown gave its library a collection of his artifacts, videotapes and legislative papers from his 40 years in public office. He is also planning to mentor students, teach a course on leadership, and recruit guest speakers.

On February 5, 2008, Simon &amp; Schuster released Brown&#x27;s hardcover autobiography, &quot;Basic Brown: My Life and Our Times&quot;, with collaborator P. J. Corkery. The book release coincided with California&#x27;s Democratic presidential primary on the same day. On July 20, 2008, Brown began writing a column for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, a move that drew the ire of some &quot;Chronicle&quot; staff members and ethicists for the failure to disclose multiple conflicts of interest.

In 2009, Brown was defending general construction contractor Monica Ung of Alamo, California. Accused of flouting labor laws and defrauding immigrant construction workers of their wages from laboring on Oakland municipal construction projects, Ung was arraigned on dozens of felony fraud charges on August 24, 2009, in Alameda County Superior Court. Brown&#x27;s decision to defend Ung angered many in the East Bay&#x27;s labor community.

In September 2013, the western span of the Bay Bridge was officially named for Brown. In early 2015, he was named to the board of directors of the San Francisco-based biopharmaceutical company Global Blood Therapeutics.

Brown has often been associated with former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served for seven years after the end of Brown&#x27;s mayoralty. In retirement, Brown continued to participate in fundraising for and advising other politicians.

===Transportation company===
In late 2012, Brown became the regulatory lawyer for Wingz, a ride-sharing service. In that capacity, he represented the company before the California Public Utilities Commission, which was creating new regulations to legalize the ability of transportation network companies to operate ridesharing services in California.

==In the media==
As mayor, Brown was often portrayed mockingly but affectionately by political cartoonists and columnists as a vain emperor, presiding in a robe and crown over the kingdom of San Francisco. He enjoyed the attention this brought to his personal life, disarming friends and critics with humor that directed attention away from the policy agendas he was pursuing.

Brown&#x27;s flamboyant style made him so well known as the consummate politician that when an actor playing a party politician in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; did not understand director Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s instruction to model his character after Brown, Coppola fired the actor and hired Brown himself to play the role. Brown later appeared in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Just One Night&quot; as a judge. He also played himself in two Disney films, &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; and &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, and in the 2003 film &quot;Hulk&quot; as the mayor of San Francisco. He appeared as himself, alongside Geraldo Rivera, in an episode of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;.

Brown was criticized in 1996 for his comments that 49ers backup quarterback Elvis Grbac was &quot;an embarrassment to humankind.&quot; He was criticized in 1997 for responding to Golden State Warriors player Latrell Sprewell choking his coach P. J. Carlesimo by saying, &quot;his boss may have needed choking.&quot;

In 1998, Brown contacted the Japanese television cooking competition Iron Chef, suggesting San Franciscan Chef Ron Siegel to battle one of the Iron Chefs. Brown appeared on the telecast himself.

Brown remained neutral in the 2008 presidential campaign. He has worked as a radio talk show host and a pundit on local and national political television shows and is seen as attempting to build credibility by abstaining from endorsing candidates for office. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been high on endorsements,&quot; Brown said. &quot;When you get one, all it does is keep the other guy from getting one. Really, what did getting John Kerry&#x27;s endorsement do to help Barack Obama?&quot;

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===
In September 1958, Brown married Blanche Vitero, with whom he had three children. Brown and Vitero have been separated since 1981, but are not divorced. James Richardson, a reporter for &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, said of Brown, &quot;The measure of his flamboyance is he&#x27;ll go to a party with his wife on one arm and his girlfriend on the other.&quot;

Brown shares three children with his wife Blanche: Susan Brown, Robin Brown, and Michael Brown, and also has a daughter, Sydney Brown, with philanthropic fundraiser Carolyn Carpeneti. He has four grandchildren (Besia Rose, Matea Friedel, Mateo Brown, and Lola Brown), a step-granddaughter (Tyler Santini), and one great-grandson (Robin Rose).

From 1994 to 1995, Brown dated Kamala Harris, who worked as an Alameda County deputy district attorney at the time. In 1994, Brown appointed Harris to two different commissions - the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the California Medical Assistance Commission. Their relationship gained renewed attention in early 2019 after she had become a U.S. senator and ran for president.

===Retinitis pigmentosa===
While serving as Assembly speaker, Brown was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that has no cure and would slowly destroy his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown&#x27;s two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, &quot;Having RP is a challenge. As Speaker of the Assembly it was very important that I recognize people in the halls of the legislature. But I couldn&#x27;t see people unless they were right in front of me. I needed to have the security people give me notes to tell me who was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use more of your brain function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands.&quot;

===Personal style===

Brown has long expressed himself through personal style, which contributed to his visibility and was turned to political advantage. Even in high school he was fastidious about his appearance. In office, Brown became famous for British and Italian suits, sports cars, nightclubbing, and a collection of dressy hats. He was once called &quot;The Best Dressed Man in San Francisco&quot; by &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine.

In his 2008 autobiography &quot;Basic Brown&quot;, he described his taste for $6,000 Brioni suits and his search for the perfect chocolate Corvette. In one chapter, &quot;The Power of Clothes: Don&#x27;t Pull a Dukakis&quot;, Brown writes that men should have a navy blazer for each season: one with &quot;a hint of green&quot; for springtime, another with more autumnal threading for the fall. He adds, &quot;You really shouldn&#x27;t try to get through a public day wearing just one thing. ... Sometimes, I change clothes four times a day.&quot;

<doc id="520602" wikidata="Q419311" url="?curid=520602" title="Sialic acid">
<text>Sialic acids are a class of alpha-keto acid sugars with a nine-carbon backbone. The term &quot;sialic acid&quot; () was first introduced by Swedish biochemist Gunnar Blix in 1952. The most common member of this group is &quot;N&quot;-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA) found in animals and some prokaryotes.

Sialic acids are found widely distributed in animal tissues and related forms are found to a lesser extent in other organisms like in some micro-algae, bacteria and archaea. Sialic acids are commonly part of glycoproteins, glycolipids or gangliosides, where they decorate the end of sugar chains at the surface of cells or soluble proteins. However, sialic acids have been also observed in &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryos and other insects. Generally, plants seem not to contain or display sialic acids.

In humans, the brain has the highest sialic acid content, where these acids play an important role in neural transmission and ganglioside structure in synaptogenesis. More than 50 kinds of sialic acid are known, all of which can be obtained from a molecule of neuraminic acid by substituting its amino group or one of its hydroxyl groups. In general, the amino group bears either an acetyl or a glycolyl group, but other modifications have been described. These modifications along with linkages have shown to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated expressions, so some of them are only found on certain types of glycoconjugates in specific cells. The hydroxyl substituents may vary considerably; acetyl, lactyl, methyl, sulfate, and phosphate groups have been found.

==Structure==

The sialic acid family includes many derivatives of the nine-carbon sugar neuraminic acid, but these acids rarely appear free in nature. Normally they can be found as components of oligosaccharide chains of mucins, glycoproteins and glycolipids occupying terminal, nonreducing positions of complex carbohydrates on both external and internal membrane areas where they are very exposed and develop important functions.

The numbering of the carbon atoms starts at the carboxylate carbon and continues along the chain. The configuration that places the carboxylate in the axial position is the alpha-anomer.

The alpha-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans. However, in solution, it is mainly (over 90%) in the beta-anomeric form. A bacterial enzyme with sialic acid mutarotase activity, NanM, that is able to rapidly equilibrate solutions of sialic acid to the resting equilibrium position of around 90% beta/10% alpha has been discovered.

In contrast to other animals, humans are genetically unable to produce the sialic acid variant N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Small amounts of Neu5Gc detected in human tissue however may be incorporated from exogenous (nutrient) sources.

==Biosynthesis==

Sialic acid is synthesized by glucosamine 6 phosphate and acetyl-CoA through a transferase, resulting in &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine-6-P. This becomes &quot;N&quot;-acetylmannosamine-6-P through epimerization, which reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate producing &quot;N&quot;-acetylneuraminic-9-P (sialic acid). For it to become active to enter in the oligosaccharide biosynthesis process of the cell, a monophosphate nucleoside is added, which comes from a cytidine triphosphate, turning sialic acid into cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-sialic acid). This compound is synthesized in the nucleus of the animal cell.

In bacterial systems, sialic acids can be also biosynthesized by an aldolase. This enzyme uses for example a mannose derivative as a substrate, inserting three carbons from pyruvate into the resulting sialic acid structure. These enzymes can be used for chemoenzymatic synthesis of sialic acid derivatives.

==Function==

Sialic acid containing glycoproteins (sialoglycoproteins) bind selectin in humans and other organisms. Metastatic cancer cells often express a high density of sialic acid-rich glycoproteins. This overexpression of sialic acid on surfaces creates a negative charge on cell membranes. This creates repulsion between cells (cell opposition) and helps these late-stage cancer cells enter the blood stream. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of sialic acid in the cancer-secreted extracellular matrix.

Sialic acid-rich oligosaccharides on the glycoconjugates (glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans) found on surface membranes help keep water at the surface of cells. The sialic acid-rich regions contribute to creating a negative charge on the cells&#x27; surfaces. Since water is a polar molecule with partial positive charges on both hydrogen atoms, it is attracted to cell surfaces and membranes. This also contributes to cellular fluid uptake. 

Sialic acid residues are present in the mucin glycoproteins of mucus.

Sialic acid can &quot;hide&quot; mannose antigens on the surface of host cells or bacteria from mannose-binding lectin. This prevents activation of complement.

Sialic acid in the form of polysialic acid is an unusual posttranslational modification that occurs on the neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs). In the synapse, the strong negative charge of the polysialic acid prevents NCAM cross-linking of cells.

Administration of estrogen to castrated mice leads to a dose-dependent reduction of the sialic acid content of the vagina. Conversely, the sialic acid content of mouse vagina is a measure of the potency of the estrogen. Reference substances are estradiol for subcutaneous application and ethinylestradiol for oral administration.

==Immunity==

Sialic acids are found at all cell surfaces of vertebrates and some invertebrates, and also at certain bacteria that interact with vertebrates.

Many viruses such as the Ad26 serotype of adenoviruses (&quot;Adenoviridae&quot;), rotaviruses (&quot;Reoviridae&quot;) and influenza viruses (&quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot;) can use host-sialylated structures for binding to their target host cell. Sialic acids provide a good target for these viruses since they are highly conserved and are abundant in large numbers in virtually all cells. Unsurprisingly, sialic acids also play an important role in several human viral infections. The influenza viruses have hemagglutinin activity (HA) glycoproteins on their surfaces that bind to sialic acids found on the surface of human erythrocytes and on the cell membranes of the upper respiratory tract. This is the basis of hemagglutination when viruses are mixed with blood cells, and entry of the virus into cells of the upper respiratory tract. Widely used anti-influenza drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir) are sialic acid analogs that interfere with release of newly generated viruses from infected cells by inhibiting the viral enzyme neuraminidase.

Some bacteria also use host-sialylated structures for binding and recognition. For example, evidence indicates that free sialic acids can behave as a signal to some specific bacteria, like &quot;Pneumococcus&quot;. Free sialic acid possibly can help the bacterium to recognize that it has reached a vertebrate environment suitable for its colonization. Modifications of Sias, such as the &quot;N&quot;-glycolyl group at the 5 position or &quot;O&quot;-acetyl groups on the side chain, may reduce the action of bacterial sialidases. 

==Metabolism==

The synthesis and degradation of sialic acid are distributed in different compartments of the cell. The synthesis starts in the cytosol, where &quot;N&quot;-acetylmannosamine 6 phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate give rise to sialic acid. Later on, Neu5Ac 9 phosphate is activated in the nucleus by a cytidine monophosphate (CMP) residue through CMP-Neu5Ac synthase. Although the linkage between sialic acid and other compounds tends to be a α binding, this specific one is the only one that is a β linkage. CMP-Neu5Ac is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus, where it can be transferred to an oligosaccharide chain, becoming a new glycoconjugate. This bond can be modified by O-acetylation or O-methylation. When the glycoconjugate is mature it is transported to the cell surface.

The sialidase is one of the most important enzymes of the sialic acid catabolism. It can cause the removal of sialic acid residues from the cell surface or serum sialoglycoconjugates. Usually, in higher animals, the glycoconjugates that are prone to be degraded are captured by endocytosis. After the fusion of the late endosome with the lysosome, lysosomal sialidases remove sialic acid residues. The activity of these sialidases is based on the removal of &quot;O&quot;-acetyl groups. Free sialic acid molecules are transported to the cytosol through the membrane of the lysosome. There, they can be recycled and activated again to form another nascent glycoconjugate molecule in the Golgi apparatus. Sialic acids can also be degraded to acylmannosamine and pyruvate with the cytosolic enzyme acylneuraminate lyase.

Some severe diseases can depend on the presence or absence of some enzymes related to the sialic acid metabolism. Sialidosis and Sialic acid deficiency with mutations in the &quot;NANS&quot; gene (see below) would be examples of this type of disorder.

==Brain development==
Rat pups supplemented with sialic acid showed improved learning and memory as adults. A relationship between dietary sialic acid supplementation and cognitive function was seen in piglets that had been fed high doses of sialic acid.

==Diseases==

Sialic acids are related to several different diseases observed in humans. 

===Sialic acid deficiency with mutations in the &quot;NANS&quot; gene ===
Biallelic recessive mutations in the sialic acid synthesis gene, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid synthase (&quot;NANS&quot;) in humans may result in a severe disease featuring intellectual disability and short stature, highlighting the importance of sialic acid in brain development. A therapeutic trial with a short-term supplementation of sialic acid given orally has failed to show a significant beneficial effect on biochemical parameters 

===Salla disease===

Salla disease is an extremely rare illness which is considered the mildest form of the free sialic acid accumulation disorders though its childhood form is considered an aggressive variant and people who suffer from it have mental retardation. It is an autosomic recessive disorder caused by a mutation of the chromosome 6. It mainly affects the nervous system and it is caused by a lysosomal storage irregularity which comes from a deficit of a specific sialic acid carrier located on the lysosomal membrane Currently, there is no cure for this disease and the treatment is supportive, focusing on the control of symptoms.

===Atherosclerosis===
Subfractions of LDL cholesterol that are implicated in causing atherosclerosis have reduced levels of sialic acid. These include small high density LDL particles and electronegative LDL. Reduced levels of sialic acid in small high density LDL particles increases the affinity of those particles for the proteoglycans in arterial walls.

===Influenza===

All influenza A virus strains need sialic acid to connect with cells. There are different forms of sialic acids which have different affinity with influenza A virus variety. This diversity is an important fact that determines which species can be infected. When a certain influenza A virus is recognized by a sialic acid receptor the cell tends to endocytose the virus so the cell becomes infected.

==Sialic acids and other nonulosonic acids (NulOs) in prokaryotes==

Sialic acids are highly abundant in vertebrate tissues where they are involved in many different biological processes. Originally discovered within the Deuterostome lineage of animals, sialic acids can be actually considered as a subset of a more ancient family of 9-carbon backbone monosaccharides called nonulosonic acids (NulOs), which more recently have been also found in Eubacteria and Archaea.
Many pathogenic bacteria incorporate sialic acid into cell surface features like their lipopolysaccharide or capsule polysaccharides, which helps them to evade the innate immune response of the host.
A recent genome level study examined a large set of sequenced microbial genomes, which indicated that biosynthetic pathways to produce nonulosonic acids (NulOs) are far more widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of life, than previously realized. This finding is moreover supported by recent lectin staining studies and a molecular level survey on prokaryotic nonulosonic acids, showing that also many non-pathogenic and purely environmental strains produce bacterial sialic acids (NulOs). Some (anammox) bacteria produce NulOs that in addition to the very acidic alpha-keto acid group also display (neutralizing) basic groups (free amines). Comparable cell surface sialic acids have been produced by chemical remodelling to manipulate the cell surface charge by producing a free amine at C5, which neutralizes the negatively charged carboxyl group at C1.

<text>Southampton Water is a tidal estuary north of the Solent and the Isle of Wight in England. The city of Southampton lies at its most northerly point, where the estuaries of the River Test and River Itchen meet. Along its salt marsh-fringed western shores lie the New Forest villages of Dibden, Hythe and Fawley, and the Fawley Refinery. On the slightly steeper eastern shore are the Southampton suburb of Weston, the villages of Netley and Hamble-le-Rice, and the Royal Victoria Country Park. To the south, Southampton Water enters the Solent between Calshot Spit and Hill Head.

Southampton Water is an estuary with major potential for land use conflicts. An area of urban development (the Waterside) runs in the narrow band of land between Southampton Water and the New Forest National Park. Villages such as Marchwood, Hythe, Dibden Purlieu, Holbury and Fawley have all experienced significant growth.

==Geography==
Geographically, Southampton Water is classified as a ria, or drowned valley, of the English Channel. It was formed by the rivers Test, Itchen and Hamble which flow into it, and became an inlet of the sea at the end of the last ice age when sea levels rose, flooding many valleys in the south of England. In particular, it is likely that Southampton Water formed partly due to the submerging of the River Solent which previously flowed through the area, and of which the River Test, River Itchen and River Medina are thought to be tributaries.

==Navigation==
With the notable exception of the oil terminals serving Fawley Refinery, most of the dock facilities of the Port of Southampton lie upstream of the top of Southampton Water, on the estuaries of the River Test and, to a lesser extent, the River Itchen. However the development of the port, particularly as a port handling very large vessels, depended partly on certain geographical features of Southampton Water, many of which in any case extend to the upstream estuaries. Southampton Waters depth, even in its undeveloped state, was generous; this depth of water has been increased over the years with comparative ease since the soft silt of the river-bed allows for easy dredging. An additional factor is the phenomenon of the &quot;double tide&quot;, which results in unusually prolonged periods of high water. This greatly facilitates the movements of very large ships.

Together with the Solent, Southampton Water is world-renowned for yachting. It served as one of the sailing and motorboating venues for the 1908 Summer Olympics.

==Crossings==
There are no fixed transport crossings of Southampton Water or the estuary of the River Test south of the bridges that link Redbridge and Totton. The Hythe Ferry, along with its associated pier and pier railway, provides a passenger service between Town Quay in Southampton and Hythe, avoiding a alternative road journey. The Itchen Bridge spans the estuary of the River Itchen just upstream of the point where it flows into Southampton Water.

Fawley Tunnel carries electrical cables in a diameter tunnel between Fawley Power Station and Chilling near Warsash.

==Dibden Bay==
Between Hythe and Marchwood, an area of reclaimed land – Dibden Bay – was the site of a proposed port expansion by Associated British Ports. This was argued to be essential for the continued economic development of the Port of Southampton but the development was vigorously opposed by conservation groups. The intertidal marshlands of Dibden Bay have international significance (Ramsar status).

The planning enquiry eventually rejected the application from Associated British Ports recommending that the environmental value of the site could not be overruled when there were alternative sites for port expansion in southern England which had not yet been fully explored. The government accepted the recommendations of the planning inspector in April 2005.

In July 2009, Associated British Ports launched a consultation on a 20-year masterplan for Southampton port. It sets out plans for future growth: &quot;In identifying the Dibden reclaim as the only possible location for port expansion, ABP is fully aware of the nature conservation value of the site and the adjoining foreshore… Our demand forecasts indicate that expansion into the Dibden reclaim will become necessary between 2021 and 2027&quot;.
==Invasive species==

Crepidula fornicata sea snails are present in Southampton Water. Austrominius modestus barnacles were first observed in southampton water in the late 1940s.

===Introduced species===
In 1925 American hard-shelled clams were introduced into the River Test in an area warmed by cooling water discharge of Southampton Power Station in an attempt to breed them to allow them to be used as eel bait. Since their introduction the clams have spread through Southampton Water and into Portsmouth Harbour and Langstone Harbour.

<text>The stripe-backed wren (Campylorhynchus nuchalis) is a bird found in the savannas of northern Colombia and central Venezuela. It lives in dry, riparian woodland, or farmlands, and is found at heights up to 800 m.

==Breeding==
The stripe-backed wren has attracted considerable scientific attention because it is a good example of co-operative breeding. It lives in groups ranging from 2 to 10 adult birds. Of these, only one pair breeds, laying eggs at the beginning of the rainy season (May to September). However, all members of the group participate in defence of the territory, and in feeding the young both in the nest and after fledging. They therefore qualify as helpers at the nest.

The non-breeding members of the group are usually offspring or siblings of the current breeding parents. After one or two seasons, females normally leave their natal groups and join another nest as helpers, typically in a neighbouring territory. Males, however, usually remain at their natal nest and if they survive will inherit the position of breeding male (though under some circumstances they too disperse). If the current breeding male dies or is removed, the next oldest male in the group normally takes over its position.

This breeding system may have evolved as a result of kin selection, but in addition it has been shown by Wiley and Rabenold (1984) that the males&#x27; behaviour of &quot;queueing&quot; for the status of breeding male can be an evolutionarily stable strategy provided some plausible conditions are met. Formally, the situation has the characteristics of a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game that is played repeatedly between the same partners, and in this case &quot;defection&quot; - jumping the queue - would not be advantageous.

Some of the calls of stripe-backed wrens show individual variations that are consistent from father to son. This is a potential example of the formation of a dialect in bird song. The distinctive family calls seem to be used to maintain social contact between members of the co-operatively breeding group.

As would be expected in a species where both sexes share in parental care, the stripe-backed wren shows no sexual dimorphism in appearance.

<doc id="520614" wikidata="Q1515888" url="?curid=520614" title="Rototom">
<text>The rototom is a shell-less drum developed by Al Payson and Michael Colgrass that is able to change pitch by rotating its drumhead around a threaded metal ring. Unlike many types of drums, rototoms are designed to have a variable definite pitch leading composers to write specific notes for them as pitched percussion instruments. They are also often used to extend the tom range of a standard drum kit.

==Description==
=== Tuning ===
Rototoms can be tuned quickly by rotating the drumhead, which sits in a threaded metal ring. Rotation raises or lowers the tension hoop relative to the rim, which increases or decreases the pitch of the drum by increasing or decreasing the tension of the drumhead.

=== Sizes ===
Drum company Remo has historically offered rototoms in seven diameters: , , , , , , and . However, as of 2023, Remo only offers rototoms ranging from a 6 to 10 inch diameter as part of a set that includes a mounting rail and stand. All other sizes have been discontinued. Each one is tunable over an octave&#x27;s range or more, although the company notes that the practical range is approximately a sixth.

==Applications==

Rototoms can replace more specialized drums such as tenor timpani owing to their clear, pitched nature. Jazz, rock and studio performers use rototoms both as a solo voice and as conventional tom-toms; they can be rapidly tuned to produce glissando effects and can be arrayed for a virtual percussion keyboard. For concert and marching band programs, rototoms combine rapid tuning with portability and sound quality, working both as concert tom-toms and as practice timpani. For stage bands and jazz ensembles, drum kits are fitted out with batter heads. When tuned to the mid-range, they have an indefinite pitch with fewer harmonic overtones than conventional tom-toms; tuned to the high range, they produce a sound not unlike timbales.

Rototoms can assist students in ear training and in developing their timpani techniques and— because of their portability, storability and relatively low cost— are often used by professional performers as practice instruments. They are also used as definite-pitched instruments in elementary music programs, such as Orff Schulwerk, where their sound quality, pitch stability and rapid tuning are assets.

== Repertoire ==
English composer Michael Tippett used a total of 38 rototoms— tuned chromatically, spanning across three octaves— in his last large-scale orchestral work, &quot;The Rose Lake&quot; (1993), based on a lake he spotted suddenly transforming from light green to translucent pink while on holiday in Senegal. In 1979, percussionist William Kraft published &quot;Encounters VI&quot;, a concertino for rototoms and percussion quartet.

<text>Eremobates is a genus of arachnids of the order Solifugae. About 2 inches long, these fast-moving arachnids have the largest jaw size to body ratio of any animal. They are not venomous, but have a remarkably powerful bite. Often hunting at night, they have poor eyesight and navigate mostly by use of a pair of pedipalps.

They are solitary creatures, coming together only to mate, the male using his pedipalps to transfer seminal fluid to the female, which buries between 50 and 200 eggs in the ground. The female stays with the young until they are mature enough to hunt and defend themselves, feeding and caring for them.

Species of the genus &quot;Eremobates&quot; are generally found in the western United States, and at northern end into southwestern Canada, and south into Mexico.

<text>Sir Richard Whitbourne (1561–1635) was an English colonist, mariner and writer.

Richard Whitbourne was born near Bishopsteignton in south Devon, England, where he was baptised on 20 June 1561. Whilst apprenticed to a merchant adventurer of Southampton, he sailed extensively around Europe and twice to Newfoundland. He served in a ship of his own against the Great Armada under Lord Admiral Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk. He spent the next thirty years in cod fishing off Newfoundland. He assisted the pirates Peter Easton and Henry Mainwaring to seek pardons from James I of England.

Asked by William Vaughan to govern his colony at Renews in Newfoundland, he did so from 1618 until 1620 when Vaughan abandoned the venture. Whitbourne was sent to establish law and order in the colony, he was the first to hold a court of justice in North America at Trinity in 1615.

In 1620, Whitbourne published &quot;A Discourse and Discovery of New-found-land&quot; in order to promote colonisation on the island.

Between 1589 (at latest) and 1627 Whitbourne had a house at or near Exmouth on the south Devon coast of England. Perhaps dying on a foreign voyage, his burial place has yet to be confirmed of either his place of birth or at St. Saviour&#x27;s Church, Southwark, London.

<doc id="520626" wikidata="Q1047508" url="?curid=520626" title="Our Lady Peace">
<text>Our Lady Peace (sometimes shortened to OLP) is a Canadian alternative rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario in 1992. Led by lead vocalist Raine Maida since its formation, the band currently also features Duncan Coutts on bass, Steve Mazur on guitars, and Jason Pierce on drums. The band has sold several million albums worldwide, won four Juno Awards, and won ten MuchMusic Video Awards—the most MMVAs ever awarded to a band (tied with Billy Talent). Nineteen of their singles have reached the Top Ten on one of Canada&#x27;s singles charts (those being the overall Singles Chart, the Rock Chart and the Alternative Rock Chart). Between 1996 and 2016, Our Lady Peace was the third best-selling Canadian band and the ninth best-selling Canadian artist overall in Canada.

Our Lady Peace has released ten studio albums, one live album, and two compilation albums, with their debut album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Naveed&quot;, having reached quadruple platinum in Canada. &quot;Naveed&quot; contains their breakthrough single, &quot;Starseed&quot;, which peaked in the Top Ten on both the US Mainstream and Alternative Rock Tracks charts, and the title track, which reached No. 4 on Canada&#x27;s Alternative Rock Chart. Their 1997 album, &quot;Clumsy&quot;, which reached No. 1 in Canada, is considered their signature and most widely recognized work. &quot;Clumsy&quot; was certified as Diamond in sales in Canada with its title track reaching No. 1 on Canada&#x27;s Singles Chart and its lead single, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Dead&quot;, reaching No. 2 on Canada&#x27;s Alternative Rock Chart. The album was certified platinum in sales in the US with the title track peaking at No. 5 on the US Alternative Rock chart. OLP&#x27;s 1999 album, &quot;Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch&quot;, also reached No. 1 in Canada and was certified triple platinum there. Its singles &quot;One Man Army&quot; and &quot;Is Anybody Home?&quot; reached Nos. 1 and 2 on Canada&#x27;s Alternative Rock Chart. The band&#x27;s first four albums are often praised for their unique sound and style, with singer Maida being called &quot;erratic&quot; and &quot;truly unrivaled&quot; as a vocalist.

Their fifth album, &quot;Gravity&quot; (2002), is considered to be a &quot;radical departure&quot; from OLP&#x27;s distinctive style. Maida has confirmed the change, calling &quot;Gravity&quot; &quot;vastly different&quot; from their previous records. &quot;Gravity&quot; reached No. 2 in Canada, where it became the group&#x27;s fifth straight (and last) double platinum seller, with its &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; and &quot;Innocent&quot; songs reaching No. 1 and 2, respectively, on Canada&#x27;s Singles Chart. &quot;Gravity&quot; was their highest charting album in the United States, reaching No. 9 on the strength of &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; being their most successful single on the US Hot 100 (No. 26) and reaching No. 7 on the US Alternative Rock Chart. Their 2005 album &quot;Healthy in Paranoid Times&quot; also peaked at No. 2 in Canada and went platinum in sales.

Having released three studio albums with only moderate success between 2009 and 2018, their sequel album &quot;Spiritual Machines 2&quot; was released in 2021. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Stop Making Stupid People Famous&quot; (feat. Pussy Riot), was released in June 2021.

==History==
===Formative years (1991–1993)===

In late 1991, guitarist Mike Turner placed an ad in Toronto-based &quot;Now newspaper&quot; in search of musicians. Michael Maida, a criminology student at the University of Toronto, was the first to reply. The two formed a band called As If, inviting Jim Newell as drummer and a friend of Turner&#x27;s, Paul Martin, to play bass. After they played a number of gigs in Oshawa with sets containing a mix of original and cover material, Martin departed, and the band placed an ad for a replacement bassist. Chris Eacrett, a business student at Ryerson University, replied and was accepted after an audition. During that time, Turner and Maida attended a music seminar where they met songwriter and producer Arnold Lanni, the owner of Arnyard Studios. The band, with Lanni, commenced writing new material and recorded some material under the As If name.

Soon after, the band&#x27;s name was changed to Our Lady Peace, after a Mark Van Doren poem of the same name. With encouragement from Lanni and his management team, the band performed some gigs in Eastern Ontario and Montreal in conjunction with The Tea Party. It was during this time that Maida began using the stage name &quot;Raine&quot; instead of &quot;Mike&quot;.
An independent music video of the band&#x27;s debut song &quot;Out of Here&quot; was created in February 1992 by Sam Siciliano, a film student and friend of Turner&#x27;s, who produced, edited, and directed the video. The video was aired on the MuchMusic &quot;Indie&quot; show. After returning to Arnyard Studios to continue writing and recording material, drummer Jim Newell departed the band. Writing and recording continued with session drummer John Bouvette.

With managers Rob Lanni and Eric Lawrence of Coalition Entertainment representing the band, short showcases were arranged with Warner Music Canada, EMI Canada, and Sony Music Canada. Sony Music Canada head of A&amp;R Richard Zuckerman liked what he heard, and saw the potential of the band, its producer, and management. The band signed a record and publishing deal with Sony Music Canada in April 1993, and commenced writing for their debut album. Around the same time, then-17-year-old Jeremy Taggart joined the band as permanent drummer.

===Early success (1994–2000)===
After writing and recording over the next year or so, OLP released its debut album, &quot;Naveed&quot;, in Canada in March 1994, through Sony Music Canada. The first single from the album, &quot;The Birdman, was released in January 1994 but did not obtain enough airplay to chart on the Canadian RPM Top 100 Singles Chart. Maida would later say &quot;The Birdman&quot; was chosen as the lead single because its non-commercial sound would likely appeal to university campus radio on which OLP hoped to develop &quot;a buzz&quot;, and that waiting a few months to release a more commercial song gave them time to tour with other bands in order to improve their live show. Following the release of the album, the band toured Canada, supporting acts I Mother Earth and 54-40. The second single was &quot;Starseed&quot; which almost made the Top 40 on the RPM Top 100 Chart; there was no national rock and alternative song chart at that time, but &quot;Starseed&quot; was ranked at No. 25 on the Top Songs of the 1990s according to 102.1 The Edge, Toronto&#x27;s most popular alternative/modern rock station. The third and fourth singles released in Canada were &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Supersatellite&quot; with each receiving moderate airplay, but it was the fifth single, the title track which drove sales of the album, as the track it went to No. 4 on the new RPM Rock/Alternative Singles Chart and was later ranked as the No. 50 alternative rock song of the 1990s by 102.1 The Edge. &quot;Naveed&quot; rose to No. 12 on the Canadian RPM Album Chart and was certified 4× Platinum for sales of 400,000 copies in Canada.

&quot;Naveed&quot; picked up and released in the United States in March 1995 by a Sony Music indie label, Relativity Records, after which the band toured as the opening act for Van Halen&#x27;s Balance summer tour as well as opening shows for Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. &quot;Starseed&quot; was a significant hit in United States reaching Nos. 7 and 11 on the Billboard Modern and Mainstream Rock Charts, respectively. Touring behind the album resumed in 1996 with time spent opening for Alanis Morissette. A remix of &quot;Starseed&quot; would later be added to the &quot;Armageddon&quot; film soundtrack. In early 1997, Our Lady Peace was offered (and the band accepted) an American signing with Columbia Records, expanding their horizons within Sony Music. After touring for the album &quot;Naveed&quot; concluded, the band began work on their second studio album. As the writing process ensued, bassist Chris Eacrett left the band due to musical differences. Duncan Coutts, a Ridley College alumnus and former classmate of Raine Maida, joined the band during the recording of that second album. Coincidentally, Duncan Coutts and Mike Turner both studied at the University of Western Ontario and lived in Saugeen–Maitland Hall.
Our Lady Peace&#x27;s second album, &quot;Clumsy&quot;, was released in January 1997. The album cover is based on an abandoned song called &quot;Trapeze&quot;, which was initially intended to be the title of the album. The albums&#x27;s lead single, the guitar-driven &quot;Superman&#x27;s Dead&quot;, quickly rose to No. 2 for five weeks on Canada&#x27;s Alternative Rock Songs chart pushing the album to debut at No. 1 on the Canadian Album Chart. The second single, &quot;Clumsy&quot;, was just as successful, topping the Canadian RPM Singles chart while also reaching No. 2 on the Alternative Rock Chart. Subsequent singles &quot;Automatic Flowers&quot; and &quot;4 AM&quot;, the band&#x27;s first ballad released as a single, also made the Top 10 on the Alternative Rock chart establishing Our Lady Peace as a leading band in the Canadian rock scene. The most-listened to alternative rock station in Canada, Toronto&#x27;s CFNY, listed &quot;Clumsy&quot; as the No. 1 album for 1997, based on sales, listener requests for songs, and listener votes for the year&#x27;s top album. In February 2001, Clumsy was certified Diamond (1 million copies) in sales in Canada. Between 1996 and 2017, &quot;Clumsy&quot; was the best-selling album by a Canadian band in Canada and the eight best-selling album by a Canadian artist overall in Canada. In the US, both &quot;Superman&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;Clumsy&quot; made the Top 15 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, while peaking at No. 11 and No. 5, respectively, on the Alternative Rock Tracks Chart. &quot;Clumsy&quot; reached the Top 80 on the Billboard Album Chart and was certified Platinum for sales of 1 million units in the US.

In 1999, Our Lady Peace released their third album, titled &quot;Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch&quot;. The album included such hits as &quot;Thief&quot;, a song about a young girl the band met named Mina Kim, who had cancer, as well as &quot;One Man Army&quot; and &quot;Is Anybody Home?&quot;. Legendary jazz drummer Elvin Jones was featured on the song &quot;Stealing Babies&quot;. Multi-instrumentalist Jamie Edwards was brought in for the 1996 sessions for the album (he remained an unofficial member of the band until 2001, when he was asked to officially join the band to finish the &quot;Gravity&quot; album). Later that year, the band played an eleven-song set at Woodstock 1999.
In 2000, the band recorded and released &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;, a concept album inspired by Ray Kurzweil&#x27;s book &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;. During the recording of the album, drummer Jeremy Taggart was sidelined with an ankle injury; Soundgarden and Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron, played drums on &quot;Right Behind You (Mafia)&quot; and &quot;Are You Sad?&quot; in his place. The album featured the singles &quot;In Repair&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Right Behind You (Mafia)&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; was also featured in the soundtrack for the Canadian sports comedy film &quot;Men with Brooms&quot;. &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; was less commercially successful than its predecessors.

===Line-up and stylistic changes (2001–2005)===
By the early 2000s, the band was becoming restless, feeling a &quot;numbness&quot; with their popularity as well as the &quot;over-saturation&quot; of their songs on Canadian radio. The band almost broke up after completing their &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; tour.

In December 2001, having dropped original producer Arnold Lanni, the band met with new producer Bob Rock to start work on their fifth album. Later the following month, founding guitarist Mike Turner either quit the band or was forced out due to the other members&#x27; concerns about his guitar-playing abilities. Said Maida of Turner&#x27;s departure, &quot;The last two records we&#x27;ve been yearning for a guitar player that can really stand up and have a strong voice and Mike (Turner) just wasn&#x27;t that kind of guitar player.&quot; Turner later formed the band Fair Ground with Harem Scarem guitarist Pete Lesperance and later joined the band Crash Karma. Turner&#x27;s last performance with the band was for &quot;Music Without Borders&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s Air Canada Centre on October 21, 2001. In the months following Turner&#x27;s departure, the band held auditions for a replacement lead guitarist. Berklee College of Music alumnus Steve Mazur, a friend of a friend of drummer Jeremy Taggart, was announced as the new guitarist in April 2002. Long-time touring musician Jamie Edwards also became an official band member around this time.

In June, their fifth album, &quot;Gravity&quot;, was completed and released. Shortly after the completion of the record, Jamie chose to leave the band for personal reasons, though he returned briefly to stand in for Mike Eisenstein during the Canadian tour of &quot;Gravity&quot;. The album received mixed reviews, with some critics and fans contending that the album was too drastic a departure from the band&#x27;s original musical style into a more mainstream sound and lacking any creativity. Maida&#x27;s signature nasal falsetto vocal technique was largely absent from the album. Maida said that the album was &quot;pretty much the opposite of &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;&quot;, calling it their &quot;most basic album&quot; since &quot;Naveed&quot;. &quot;Gravity&quot;&#x27;s Canadian chart-topping first single, &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, became the band&#x27;s biggest international hit to date peaking at No. 26 on the US Hot 100 and No. 7 on the US Alternative Rock Song Chart. Its second single, &quot;Innocent&quot;, was also very popular, peaking at No. 2 in Canada, and regained popularity in 2008 after a cover performance on &quot;American Idol&quot;. Gravity proved to be more successful than Spiritual Machines in both America and Canada, due to the success of the singles; it reached No. 2 in Canada and No. 9 in the US, their highest charting album in the US. In between their fifth and sixth albums, OLP released their first live album, titled simply &quot;Live&quot;, which contains a selection of the band&#x27;s hits from their first five albums as played throughout tours in various Canadian cities.

In August 2005, the band released their sixth album, &quot;Healthy in Paranoid Times&quot;, which included the singles &quot;Angels/Losing/Sleep&quot;, &quot;Will the Future Blame Us&quot;, and &quot;Where Are You?&quot; According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it took 1165 days to create it, and its twelve tracks were chosen from forty-five that the band had written and produced. Maida has since criticized &quot;Healthy in Paranoid Times&quot;, saying that &quot;(the) record was total excess, total bullshit in the sense of, we finally had succumbed to a label: making us record that many songs, trying to find the right singles for American radio and MTV.&quot; After nearly breaking up during the recording of &quot;Healthy in Paranoid Times&quot; the band took a prolonged hiatus.

===Compilations, hiatus, and &quot;Burn Burn&quot; (2006–2009)===
In November 2006, Columbia Records released a greatest hits compilation titled &quot;A Decade,&quot; following the band&#x27;s departure from the label. There were two previously unreleased songs on the album, &quot;Kiss on the Mouth&quot; and &quot;Better Than Here&quot;. Steve Mazur wrote in a blog on the band&#x27;s fan club that the new songs on the disc were two unreleased songs from the &quot;Healthy in Paranoid Times&quot; sessions. The collection also included a bonus DVD containing live concert footage and exclusive interviews at the Massey Hall concert. The single &quot;Kiss on the Mouth&quot;, the first off &quot;A Decade&quot;, has received play on radio stations across Canada. Lead vocalist Raine Maida began work on his first solo album, &quot;The Hunters Lullaby&quot;, released in 2007, while the remaining members of the band pursued other personal endeavours. The hiatus would result in the longest time gap between OLP studio albums to date.

The band began working on &quot;Burn Burn&quot;, their seventh studio album, in February 2007. On March 31, 2009, Legacy Recordings released OLP&#x27;s second compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Our Lady Peace&quot; as part of the Playlist series. The album includes the popular singles &quot;Naveed&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, as well as lesser-known songs such as &quot;Car Crash&quot; and &quot;Stealing Babies&quot;. That same month, the band completed the new material, with Raine calling the new album &quot;huge&quot;, and noted it as being a &quot;proper rock album again&quot;, featuring a return to the raw originality of the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Naveed&quot;, though a &quot;little more mature&quot;. Maida produced the album himself, noting his excitement over &quot;not (having had) anybody intrude on (recording) sessions&quot;. The album was released in North America on July 21, 2009, to mixed reviews, though the album later received Gold status in Canada. The band toured to promote &quot;Burn Burn&quot; and made stops in several cities across North America from July through December 2009.

===Recreation tour and &quot;Curve&quot; (2010–2012)===
In December 2009, the band announced a new tour. In a tour that ran from March to May 2010, and spanned Canada and select U.S. cities, the band &quot;recreated&quot; both their 1997 album &quot;Clumsy&quot; and their 2000 album &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; in their entirety.

Our Lady Peace&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Curve&quot;, began production in January 2010 and was released April 3, 2012. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heavyweight&quot;, was released on December 20, 2011. In a March 2010 interview, lead singer Raine Maida noted that after having gone back to re-learn songs from &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; and &quot;Clumsy&quot; in preparation for their tour, he was &quot;brought back to the great things about this band&quot;. He added that fans—especially those who are particularly fond of the pre-&quot;Gravity&quot; albums—should expect to see &quot;a lot of stuff (from pre-&quot;Gravity&quot; albums) creeping its way back into our music&quot;.

In 2012, the band released a song titled &quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot; in reaction to the Occupy Wall Street events that took place across North America in late 2011 for &quot;Occupy This Album&quot;.

===Taggart&#x27;s departure and &quot;Somethingness&quot; (2014–2018)===
A planned tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Naveed&quot; was cancelled in early 2014 due to &quot;scheduling conflicts&quot;. In June 2014, speculation began that longtime drummer Jeremy Taggart was no longer part of the band; this was confirmed in statements by both Taggart and Our Lady Peace on June 30, 2014. Canadian drummer Jason Pierce (ex-touring drummer for Paramore and current touring drummer for Treble Charger) filled in during live shows, and Jason Boesel of Rilo Kiley handled recording duties.

On April 30, 2014, Raine Maida revealed on his Twitter account that OLP was headed back into the studio with producer Mike Elizondo, in Los Angeles. On July 10, 2014, the band débuted their single, &quot;Won&#x27;t Turn Back&quot;, on Toronto&#x27;s 102.1 The Edge radio station. On July 17, &quot;Won&#x27;t Turn Back&quot; was released on iTunes in Canada. Maida described the song as &quot;poppier&quot; than much of their discography.

On November 20, the band tweeted that it would be releasing unreleased songs and b-side tracks via email subscription. The first song from the &quot;OLP Vault&quot; was &quot;No Warning&quot;, released on November 27. A second, a demo of &quot;Not Afraid&quot; was released on December 11. A live cover of Lana Del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Summertime Sadness&quot; was released on December 24 and on January 15, a demo version of Consequence of Laughing, named &quot;Immune&quot; was released from the vault. On January 28, &quot;Hurt Yourself&quot;, a track recorded during Healthy in Paranoid Times, and released alongside #BellLetsTalk to raise awareness for mental illness, was released. On February 14, the band released a clip of the demo &quot;Say&quot;. A full version of the song &quot;Vampires&quot; was released on March 2.

It was later announced that Pierce was now an official member of Our Lady Peace.

On August 11, 2017, the band announced the release of their ninth album, &quot;Somethingness&quot;, on their Facebook page. The band planned the release in the form of two EP volumes. The first single &quot;Drop Me In The Water&quot; was released on August 18, and the &quot;Vol. 1&quot; EP was released on August 25, 2017. The full album (including the tracks from the Vol. 1 EP) was released on February 23, 2018.

===&quot;Spiritual Machines 2&quot; and &quot;The Wonderful Future&quot; tour (2019–2025)===
In May 2019, the &quot;Republican-American&quot; reported that a tenth studio album by Our Lady Peace was in the works, which, according to Maida, would continue &quot;the guitar-driven approach.&quot; In August 2020, it was revealed that album will be titled &quot;Spiritual Machines 2&quot;, and will be a direct sequel to the band&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. &quot;Spiritual Machines 2&quot; was produced by Dave Sitek, and its genre has been described by the band as &quot;future rock&quot;. In June 2021, the band&#x27;s official Facebook account hinted that original co-founder and guitarist Mike Turner would be a featured guest on the album. Raine Maida later confirmed that Turner had indeed returned, stating that &quot;Spiritual Machines 2&quot; wouldn&#x27;t have been &quot;right without Mike involved&quot;.

In June 2022, the band began a cross-country tour called &quot;The Wonderful Future Theatrical Experience&quot;, named after the final song on their 2000 album &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. The tour featured what have been referred to as holographic display capsules, which were placed on stage in advance of the live show, and contained a video screen that displayed selected pre-recorded videos of band members as well as various special guests. Special guests appearing through the holographic technology included Sarah Slean, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Ray Kurzweil, and former OLP guitarist Mike Turner. Turner also played guitar live in person (alongside his successor Steve Mazur) at select venues, which is the first time he performed on stage with Our Lady Peace since his original departure from the band in 2001. In December 2022, the band released a rendition of Jane&#x27;s Addiction &quot;Mountain Song&quot;.

===30th Anniversary Tour; Return of &quot;Whatever&quot; (2025–present)===

The band began a tour to celebrate their 30th anniversary in February 2025. All dates are in Canada. 

On the first night of their 30th Anniversary Tour in Calgary, the band played their song &quot;Whatever&quot; live for the first time in 22 years, after deciding it was time for them to &quot;reclaim the song&quot; having purposefully not played it due to its ties to the highly controversial deceased professional wrestler Chris Benoit (who used the song as an entrance theme when he was alive).

==Summersault festivals==
Our Lady Peace founded the &quot;Summersault&quot; festival that toured across Canada in 1998, and again in 2000. The 1998 tour ran from late August to early September at outdoor venues in Barrie (north of Toronto), Quebec City, St. John&#x27;s and Shediac (New Brunswick). The concerts featured headliners Our Lady Peace along with a slate that included I Mother Earth, Sloan, Garbage, Treble Charger, Bucket Truck, The Crystal Method and Moist.

There were discussions of a &quot;Summersault&quot; festival for 1999, but the tour did not return until 2000; the second iteration of the festival featured a larger, more impressive roster of bands, with a more extensive Canadian itinerary. Over the first half of August 2000, the festival played at outdoor venues in eight of the largest Canadian metropolises.

Our Lady Peace&#x27;s headlining set from the 2019 &quot;Summersault&quot; Festival was released on YouTube Live in 2020. Primarily filmed on September 13, 2019, at Landsdowne Park in Canada&#x27;s capital city of Ottawa, ON. The performance features some of the band&#x27;s best-known hits. As part of the release of the concert, Our Lady Peace offered discounts at their online merch store. All proceeds from the sales went to two major food banks, one in the United States and one in Canada, respectively.
The 2000 tour featured 11 bands.

2019 Festival lineup:

* Our Lady Peace

* Bush

* Live

* Dear Rouge

* Human Kebab

==Musical style and themes==

Our Lady Peace is mainly described as post-grunge and alternative rock.

In the band&#x27;s early years, especially on &quot;Naveed&quot; and &quot;Clumsy&quot;, their overall sound was often compared to alternative rock and grunge bands including Soundgarden, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Pearl Jam. The band&#x27;s melodic structure was also said to echo that of bands such as The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Lead singer Raine Maida expresses much admiration for vocalist Mike Patton and his versatility, calling him &quot;by far one of the best singers and best showmen in rock&quot;, while also naming the song &quot;Everything&#x27;s Ruined&quot; by his band Faith No More among his favorites. Maida&#x27;s voice was called &quot;erratic&quot; and &quot;truly unrivaled&quot; in his field. In albums &quot;Naveed&quot; through &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;, Maida sang in a countertenor vocal register and was known for his frequent use of falsetto. This singing method, in combination with the band&#x27;s melody structure, often gave many songs a surreal sound and effect.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;Whatever&quot; was used as professional wrestler Chris Benoit&#x27;s WWE theme song from 2002 until his death in 2007. Our Lady Peace had not performed the song live for a number of years prior to the murder/suicide of Benoit and his family in 2007. In a 2012 interview, the band stated that they would never play the song live again due to the circumstances of Benoit&#x27;s death. The band resumed playing the song as part of their 30th Anniversary Tour in 2025.

<text>Crotales (, ), sometimes called antique cymbals, are percussion instruments consisting of small, tuned bronze or brass disks. Each is about in diameter with a flat top surface and a nipple on the base. They are commonly played by being struck with hard mallets. However, they may also be played by striking two disks together in the same manner as finger cymbals, or by bowing. Their sound is rather like a small tuned bell, only with a much brighter sound and a much longer resonance. Similar to tuned finger cymbals, crotales are thicker and larger; they also have slight grooves in them. The name comes from the Greek &quot;crotalon&quot;, for a castanet or rattle.

Modern crotales are arranged chromatically and have a range of up to two octaves. They are typically available in sets (commonly one octave) but may also be purchased individually. Crotales are treated as transposing instruments; music for crotales is written two octaves lower than the sounding pitch to minimize ledger lines.

Crotal bells are a type of small bell, mostly medieval. A different form of crotal is found in Prehistoric Ireland. The National Museum of Ireland and British Museum have several examples on display dating from the late Bronze Age () which were found in the Dowris Hoard, alongside various brass wind instruments. These are bronze cylinders in the rough shape of a bull&#x27;s testicle, with a piece of baked clay or a pebble inside. It is presumed they functioned as a type of rattle. The hoard had 48 of them in total, in two sizes. Only two other examples are known, both Irish.

== Uses ==
One of the earliest uses of crotales in the orchestral repertoire is Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1839). Other classical pieces featuring crotales include Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, Maurice Ravel&#x27;s orchestration of his &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; and Henri Dutilleux&#x27;s Cello Concerto.

The contemporary American composer John Adams uses them in many of his more colorful orchestral pieces such as &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot;. Composer Julia Wolfe uses crotales in her oratorio &quot;Fire in my mouth&quot;.

Crotales are also found in popular music, particularly in rock music. Neil Peart of Rush used them as part of his basic drum kit for several years, featuring them in the introduction to the instrumental &quot;YYZ&quot;, and Alan White of Yes used them in the middle instrumental section of &quot;Awaken&quot; from &quot;Going for the One&quot;. The Bengsons use them in the instrumentation of their Off-Broadway show &quot;Hundred Days.&quot; Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche uses them live on the &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; song &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;.

<doc id="520635" wikidata="Q19126" url="?curid=520635" title="Solifugae">
<text>Solifugae is an order of arachnids known variously as solifuges, sun spiders, camel spiders, and wind scorpions. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 147 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae). Because of this, it is less ambiguous to call them &quot;solifuges&quot;. Most species of solifuge live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of solifuges, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.

==Etymology==
The order&#x27;s name is derived from the Latin &quot;sol&quot; meaning &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;fugere&quot; meaning &quot;to flee&quot;. Put together, it means &quot;those who flee from the sun&quot;. These animals have a number of common names including sun spiders, wind scorpions, wind spiders, red romans, and camel spiders. In Afrikaans, they are known as &quot;haarskeerders&quot; (&quot;hair cutters&quot;), and &quot;baardskeerders&quot; (&quot;beard cutters&quot;). This is in reference to myths that they cut hair to be used as nest bedding.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Solifuges are moderately small to large arachnids (a few millimeters to several centimeters in body length), with the larger species reaching in length, including legs. In practice, the respective lengths of the legs of various species differ greatly, so the resulting figures are often misleading. More practical measurements refer primarily to the body length, quoting leg lengths separately, if at all. The body length is up to . Most species are closer to long, and some small species are under in head-plus-body length when mature.

Like that of spiders, the body plan of the Solifugae has two main tagmata: the prosoma, or cephalothorax, is the anterior tagma, and the 10-segmented abdomen, or opisthosoma, is the posterior tagma. The abdominal tergites and sternites are separated by large areas of intersegmental membranes, giving it a high degree of flexibility and ability to stretch considerably, which allows it to consume a large amount of food. As shown in the illustrations, the solifuge prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or &quot;pedicel&quot; as occurs in Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between the Solifugae and spiders, namely that solifuges lack both spinnerets and silk, and do not spin webs. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the Solifugae have no such adaptation.

The prosoma comprises the head, the mouthparts, and the somites that bear the legs and the pedipalps. It is covered by a carapace, also called a prosomal dorsal shield or peltidium, which is composed of three distinct elements called propeltidium, mesopeltidium and metapeltidium. The propeltidium contains the eyes, the chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large, the pedipalps and the first two pairs of legs. Meso- and metapeltidium contains the third and fourth pairs of legs. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifuges do not have a third tagma that forms a &quot;tail&quot;.

Currently, neither fossil nor embryological evidence shows that arachnids ever had a separate thorax-like division, so the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means a fused cephalon, or head, and thorax, has been questioned. Also, arguments exist against use of &quot;abdomen&quot;, as the opisthosoma of many arachnids contains organs atypical of an abdomen, such as a heart and respiratory organs.

Like other arachnids outside the orders of scorpions and the Tetrapulmonata, the Solifugae lack book lungs, having instead a well-developed tracheal system that inhales and exhales air through a number of spiracles - one pair between the second and third pair of walking legs, two pairs on the abdomen on abdominal segments three and four, and an unpaired spiracle on the fifth abdominal segment. Air sacs are attached to the branching tracheae, with tracheoles penetrating the epithelia of internal organs. Hemocyanin, a respiratory pigment common in the hemolymph of many arachnids and other arthropods, is absent. As embryos they also have opisthosomal protuberances resembling the pulmonary sacs found in some palpigrades.

===Chelicerae===
Among the most distinctive features of the Solifugae are their large chelicerae, which in many species are longer than the prosoma. Each of the two chelicerae has two (segments, parts connected by a joint), forming a powerful pincer, much like that of a crab; each article bears a variable number of teeth, largely depending on the species. The chelicerae of many species are surprisingly strong; they are capable of shearing hair or feathers from vertebrate prey or carrion, and of cutting through skin and thin bones such as those of small birds. Many Solifugae stridulate with their chelicerae, producing a rattling noise.

===Legs and pedipalps===

These elements work the same way as in most other arachnids. Although the Solifugae appear to have five pairs of legs, only the hind four pairs are true legs. Each true leg has seven segments: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, and tarsus.

The first, or anterior, of the five pairs of leg-like appendages are not &quot;actual&quot; legs, but pedipalps, and they have only five segments each. The pedipalps of the Solifugae function partly as sense organs similar to insects&#x27; antennae, and partly in locomotion, feeding, and fighting. In normal locomotion, they do not quite touch the ground, but are held out to detect obstacles and prey; in that attitude, they look particularly like an extra pair of legs or perhaps arms. Reflecting the great dependence of the Solifugae on their tactile senses, their anterior true legs commonly are smaller and thinner than the posterior three pairs. That smaller anterior pair acts largely in a sensory role as a supplement to the pedipalps, and in many species they accordingly lack tarsi. At the tips of their pedipalps, Solifugae bear a membranous suctorial organ, which are used for capturing prey, and also for bringing water to their mouthparts for drinking and climbing smooth surfaces.
For the most part, only the posterior three pairs of legs are used for running. On the undersides of the coxae and trochanters of the last pair of legs, the Solifugae have fan-shaped sensory organs called malleoli or racquet (or racket) organs. Sometimes, the blades of the malleoli are directed forward, sometimes not. They have been suspected to be sensory organs for the detection of vibrations in the soil, perhaps to detect threats and potential prey or mates. These structures may be chemoreceptors.

Males are usually smaller than females, with relatively longer legs. Unlike females, the males bear a pair of flagella, one on each chelicera. In the accompanying photograph of a male solifuge, one flagellum is just visible near the tip of each chelicera. The flagella, which bend back over the chelicerae, are sometimes called horns and are believed to have some sexual connection, but their function has not yet been clearly explained.
===Eyes===

Solifuges have a pair of large central eyes known as median ocelli These eyes are oriented at the very front of its cephalothorax and are placed close together. These eyes have a pigment-cup structure and are covered by a domed outer lens made from the animal&#x27;s exoskeleton. Below the dome is the animal&#x27;s retina, a multi-tiered structure with a layer of cells called the vitreous body at its top. Underneath is the thin preretinal membrane, acting as a barrier between the vitreous body above and the rhabdomeres beneath. Rhabdomeres are light-sensitive and function as the eye&#x27;s photoreceptors. Interspersed between the rhabdomeres are pigment cells. The eye&#x27;s optic nerve begins at its center and is connected to the axons of numerous rhabdomeres.

In addition to the median eyes, solifuges possess a pair of vestigial lateral ocelli. These eyes are found in pits on the animal&#x27;s cephalic lobes near the chelicerae. The ocelli&#x27;s lenses are usually atrophied. However, in some species both nerves and pigment cells are present. In species where lateral eyes are functional, they probably aid in detecting motions or changes in light intensity.

==Habitat and distribution==
Most solifuges live in tropics and subtropical deserts in the Americas, Southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Surprisingly, these animals are absent in Australia and Madagascar. Within the desert, solifuges live in a variety of micro-habitats. These include sand dunes, sand flats, floodplains, rocky hillsides, desert shrublands, gravel plains, and mountain valleys. In addition to the desert, certain solifuges live in more arid grasslands and forests.

Depending on the species in question, solifuges may be more sedentary or on the move. Sedentary species are often fossorial, living in relatively permanent burrows underground. Transitory species spend most of their time up the surface, occasionally seeking refuge in cracks or under rocks and vegetation.

== Behavior and life history ==

=== Diet and hunting ===

Solifuges are carnivores and typically generalists, feeding on a wide variety of prey in their given environment. For most species, insects make up the bulk of their diet. However, these animals have been known to consume anything they can subdue. This includes other arachnids like spiders, scorpions, and smaller solifuges, other arthropods like millipedes, and small lizards, birds, and mammals. Additionally, solifuges are voracious eaters. It&#x27;s common for adult females to eat so much that they&#x27;re temporarily unable to walk.

When looking for prey, most solifuges rapidly move about while tapping their pedipalps on the ground. The only exception is the majority of termite-loving species, as they prefer to be more sedentary. In addition to using their pedipalps, solifuges have a variety of methods to locate prey. These include seeing movements with their eyes, feeling with their long hairlike setae, smelling with their malleoli, and sensing vibrations. How much the animal relies on each sense depends on the species. While all hunt on the ground, some species are great climbers, able to search for prey on trees, shrubs, and on artificial structures.

Solifuges hunt their prey using three main hunting strategies: stalking, chasing, and ambushing. Depending on the meal&#x27;s size, prey is seized with the animal&#x27;s pedipalps or massive chelicerae. When the pedipalps are used, prey is initially caught with the limb&#x27;s suction cups, then rapidly pulled towards the chelicerae to be chewed. These motions happen so fast that they can&#x27;t be distinguished. Before eating, solifuges prepare their food by removing any parts they find unfavorable. In arthropods, these are typically areas that have a high amount of chitin (heads, antennae, wings, etc).

Solifuges eat in different ways based on the shape of their food. Prey that is long and narrow is held perpendicular to the chelicerae and chewed from one end to another. More round prey is chewed by rotating the body all at once. This chewing motion turns the food into a liquidized paste which is then swallowed by the animal&#x27;s pharynx. Solifuges that haven&#x27;t fed for long periods are known to eat faster than ones that fed recently. Larger solifuges are also known to eat faster than smaller ones.

=== Reproduction ===
The Solifugae are typically univoltine (reproducing once a year). Reproduction can involve direct or indirect sperm transfer; when indirect, the male emits a spermatophore on the ground and then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female&#x27;s genital pore. To do this, he flings the female on her back.

The female then digs a burrow, into which she lays 50 to 200 eggs; some species then guard them until they hatch. Because the female does not feed during this time, she tries to fatten herself beforehand, and a species of has been observed to eat more than 100 flies during that time in the laboratory. The Solifugae undergo a number of stages including, egg, postembryo, 9–10 nymphal instars, and adults.

== Classification and phylogeny ==
Solifuges are an order of arachnids comprising over 1200 species in 146 genera assigned to 16 different families. Solifuges can be divided into two groups of families which are recognized as distinct suborders. These are the Australosolifugae which live predominantly in the Southern Hemisphere and the Boreosolifugae which live mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. This phylogeny is considered congruent with a Gondwanan origin for Australosolifugae and a Laurasian origin for Boreosolifugae. When looking at their relationships, the families Ammotrechidae and Daesiidae were found to be paraphyletic, leading to multiple clades without a name. Because of this, a later genomic study established three additional families: Dinorhaxidae, Lipophagidae, and Namibesiidae.

Suborder Boreosolifugae
* Eremobatidae 
* Galeodidae 
* Gylippidae 
* Karschiidae 
* Rhagodidae 
Suborder Australosolifugae
* Ammotrechidae 
* Ceromidae 
* Daesiidae 
* Dinorhaxidae 
* Hexisopodidae 
* Melanoblossiidae 
* Mummuciidae 
* Lipophagidae 
* Namibesiidae 
* Solpugidae 
incertae sedis
* †Protosolpugidae 
=== Phylogeny ===
Below is a family tree of the various solifuge families based on phylogenomics.

== Relationship with humans ==

Solifuges have been recognized as distinct taxa from ancient times. In Aelian&#x27;s &quot;De natura animalium&quot;, &quot;four-jawed spiders&quot; are credited, along with scorpions, as being responsible for the abandoning of a desert region near the Astaboras river (said to be in India, but thought to be a river in Ethiopia). Anton August Heinrich Lichtenstein theorized in 1797 that the &quot;mice&quot; that plagued the Philistines in the Old Testament were Solifugae. During World War I, troops stationed in Abū Qīr, Egypt, would stage fights between captive &quot;jerrymanders&quot;, as they referred to them, and placed bets on the outcome. Similarly, British troops stationed in Libya in World War II staged fights between solifuges and scorpions.

=== Urban legends ===
The Solifugae are the subject of many legends and exaggerations about their size, speed, behavior, appetite, and lethality. They are not especially large, the biggest having a leg span around . They are fast on land compared to other invertebrates, with their top speed estimated to be .

The Solifugae apparently have neither venom glands nor any venom-delivery apparatus such as the fangs of spiders, stings of wasps, or venomous setae of caterpillars (e.g., &quot;Lonomia&quot; or &quot;Acharia&quot; species). One 1978 study is frequently quoted, in which the authors report detection of an exception in India, in that &quot;Rhagodes nigrocinctus&quot; had venom glands, and that injection of the secretion into mice was frequently fatal. However, no supporting studies have confirmed either statement, such as by independent detection of the glands as claimed, or the relevance of the observations, if correct. Even the authors of the original account admitted to having found no means of delivery of the putative venom by the animal, and the only means of administering the material to the mice was by parenteral injection. Given that many non-venoms such as saliva, blood and glandular secretions can be lethal if injected, and that no venomous function was even speculated upon in this study, there is still no evidence for even one venomous species of solifuge.

Because of their unfamiliar spider-like appearance and rapid movements, Solifugae have startled or even frightened many people. This fear was sufficient to drive a family from their home in August 2008 when one was allegedly discovered in a soldier&#x27;s house in Colchester, England, and caused the family to blame the solifuge for the death of their pet dog. An Arizona resident developed painful lesions due to a claimed solifuge bite but could not produce a specimen for confirmation. Though they are not venomous, the powerful chelicerae of a large specimen may inflict a painful nip, but nothing medically significant.

Claims that Solifugae aggressively chase people are also untrue, as they are merely trying to stay in the shade/shadow provided by the human.

<doc id="520645" wikidata="Q6756832" url="?curid=520645" title="2004 Istanbul restaurant attack">
<text>On March 9, 2004, an attack on a restaurant in the Kartal district of Istanbul, Turkey killed Hüseyin Kurugöl, a waiter in the restaurant, and injured five others. The two Islamic militants who carried out the attack, Engin Vural and Nihat Doğruel, were holding automatic weapons and had ten homemade pipe bombs strapped to their flak jackets when they entered the restaurant frequented by freemasons. Shooting the guard in his feet, they entered the dining hall and began firing at the forty people in the room. Then they detonated bombs at the entrance, killing Kurugöl. One of the militants died in the attack, the other was seriously injured. 

This attack occurred 911 days after the September 11 attacks. On March 11, the newspaper &quot;Al-Quds Al-Arabi&quot; received a statement which claimed that an al-Qaeda affiliated group, Jund al-Quds, (&#x27;Soldiers of Jerusalem&#x27;), had carried out the attack. The statement&#x27;s primary purpose was to claim responsibility for the March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks.

In August 2004, the trial of the suspects began. While Turkish authorities said there was likely an al-Qaeda link, the surviving bomber, Engin Vural, claimed it was an independent act he planned along with the dead bomber, Nihat Doğruel. The prosecution charged that a man named Adem Çetinkaya, who was also charged, organized the attack and was also planning to bomb a private television station.

<text>Palermo Football Club () is an Italian professional football club based in Palermo, Sicily, that currently plays in Serie B. It is part of the City Football Group.

Founded for the first time on 1 November 1900 as Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club, Palermo is one of the oldest clubs in Italy.

Among the club&#x27;s accomplishments are a Coppa Italia Serie C, won in the 1992–93, and five Serie B league titles. It also appeared in three Coppa Italia finals: in 1973–74, in 1978–79 and in 2010–11; and played 29 seasons in Serie A.

Internationally, the club has made five appearances in European competitions, all in the UEFA Cup/Europa League.

==History==

===Early history (1898–1947)===
There is some debate and uncertainty about the exact date the club was founded. Some authorities believe that it may have been founded as early as 1898 due to the existence of papers addressed to Joseph Whitaker, English ornithologist in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermo football team founded in the month of April of that year. Conversely, another source cites that in April 1897, the future founders of Palermo Calcio founded the association &quot;Sport Club&quot;. The most common and officially stated foundation date is 1 November 1900, as the Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club. The club is thought to have been founded by Ignazio Majo Pagano, a young Palermitan colleague of Whitaker who had discovered football while at college in London in the UK, where the modern game of association football originated. The initial staff comprised three Englishmen and nine natives of Palermo, with Whitaker as honorary chairman, Edward De Garston as inaugural president and with red and blue as the original team colours. The first recorded football match, played by the team on 30 December 1900, ended in a 5–0 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The club&#x27;s first official match, played on 18 April 1901 against Messina Football Club, ended in a 3–2 victory for the Palermitan side.

In 1907, the club changed its name to Palermo Foot-Ball Club, and the team colours were changed to the current pink and black. From 1908 until Italy&#x27;s entry in World War I in 1915, Palermo was featured in the Lipton Challenge Cup, organised by Scottish businessman Sir Thomas Lipton. The competition saw them face off against Naples FBC; Palermo won the competition three times, including a 6–0 victory in 1912.

After a gap during the First World War, the club was refounded in 1919 as Unione Sportiva Palermo, by a committee of young university students and sportsmen. During the early 1920s, the club mainly competed in the &quot;Campionato Lega Sud&quot;, a football league in Southern Italy, reaching the semi-finals in 1924 before being knocked out by Audace Taranto, Alba Roma and Internaples. The club was dissolved in 1927 due to financial problems, but was reformed one year later following a merger with Vigor Palermo under the name Palermo FootBall Club. Originally admitted to &quot;Prima Divisione&quot; (First Division), the equivalent of today&#x27;s Serie C1, the team was promoted to Serie B in 1930 and finally reached Serie A in 1932. From its debut season in Italy&#x27;s top division, Palermo relocated to a new home, the &quot;Stadio Littorio&quot; (Lictorian Stadium) in the Favorita neighbourhood, today known as Stadio Renzo Barbera. The club played in Serie A until 1936, when they were relegated to Serie B and first played Catania in the Sicilian derby.

In 1936, Palermo was forced by the fascist regime to change its colours to yellow and red, after the official colours of the local municipality. Meanwhile, economic difficulties arose, and in 1940 the club was expelled by the Italian Football Federation because of financial problems. A merger with Unione Sportiva Juventina Palermo brought the foundation of Unione Sportiva Palermo-Juventina, which joined Serie C in 1941 and Serie B in 1942.

The club could not finish the 1942–43 season due to the outbreak of World War II. At the same time the pink-and-black colors were chosen because Sicily became a &quot;war zone&quot;. After the conflict, the club changed its name to US Palermo.

===Post-war years (1947–2002)===
After World War II, the team returned to Serie A by winning the Serie B championship of 1947–48. The new Palermo squad featured players such as Czechoslovakian legend Čestmír Vycpálek who signed from Juventus alongside Conti, Carmelo Di Bella and Pavesi. Palermo played Serie A until they were relegated in 1954. Massive changes in the board, as well as the manager&#x27;s job and the squad, proved successful and the club returned to Serie A in 1956. Palermo became a &quot;yo-yo club&quot;, bouncing up and down between the top two Italian leagues. Several stars played for Palermo during this period, such as Argentine striker Santiago Vernazza (51 goals in 115 games with the &quot;Rosanero&quot;), goalkeepers Roberto Anzolin and Carlo Mattrel, Giuseppe Furino and Franco Causio. Palermo marked its best campaign in 1961–62 season, finishing in eighth place in Serie A. In 1963, however, they were relegated to Serie B, where they played for five seasons. Palermo played again in Serie A between 1968 and 1970.

In 1970, Renzo Barbera took over the club as the new chairman. After 1973, Palermo FBC remained firmly rooted in Serie B. Despite this, Palermo reached two Italian Cup finals, both of which they narrowly lost: in 1974 to Bologna on penalty shoot-outs, and in 1979 to Juventus after extra time. Barbera left the club in 1980 and Palermo were relegated to Serie C1 four years later. The 1985–86 season, however, which ended in the summer, was the last for Palermo FBC, as, having just saved themselves from relegation, the club was expelled by the football federation due to financial problems. In the summer of 1987, after a year without professional football in Palermo, the club was re-founded bearing a new name, and began to play in Serie C2, which it promptly won.

In the 1990s, Palermo played between Serie B and Serie C1 with a few highs, such as its 1995–96 Serie B and Coppa Italia campaign, the latter ending in the quarter-finals, and a number of lows such as the 1998 relegation to Serie C2 after defeat in the play-offs to Battipagliese, later revoked by the federation to fill a vacant league slot.

In March 2000, Roma chairman Franco Sensi led a holding company to purchase Palermo and Sergio D&#x27;Antoni became the president of Palermo and Palermo were promoted to Serie B one year later after a dramatic final week of the season, with Palermo coming back from behind to take first place from league-toppers Sicilian rivals Messina. The first comeback season in the Serie B, with Bortolo Mutti as head coach, was an eventless one, with Palermo ending in a mid-table placement.

===The Zamparini era: back to Serie A and European years (2002–2013)===

In the summer of 2002, Friulian businessman and Venezia owner Maurizio Zamparini acquired the club from Franco Sensi in a €15 million bid, with the clear intention to bring Palermo back to Serie A and establish the club as a Serie A regular with aims of participations to European competitions. Palermo failed in its first attempt to reach the Serie A in 2002–03 on the final week of the season, but later managed to achieve it after a hard but successful 2003–04 campaign which saw Palermo crowned as Serie B champions and promoted to Serie A after 31 years, under head coach Francesco Guidolin, who was hired in January 2004 as replacement for dismissed Silvio Baldini.

The 2004–05 season, the first in Serie A for the Palermo club since 1973, ended with an excellent sixth place, securing qualification for the 2005–06 UEFA Cup for the first time in its history. Luca Toni broke the Palermo Serie A scoring record by notching up 20 league goals. In the following season, despite an unimpressive eighth place in the Serie A table, Palermo reached the last 16 in the UEFA Cup as well as the Coppa Italia semi-finals. The club was however admitted to play UEFA Cup again due to the 2006 &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, with Palermo players Andrea Barzagli, Cristian Zaccardo, Simone Barone and Fabio Grosso being crowned 2006 World Cup winners. A number of impressive signings were made to establish an ambitious team, and a good beginning in the 2006–07 campaign appeared initially to confirm this. An 11-game winless streak, however, forced Palermo to fall down from third to seventh place, ending the season in fifth place and ensuring another UEFA Cup qualification. The club successively established as a force in the mid-table part of the Serie A league, also winning a Campionato Nazionale Primavera national title in 2009.

The following season started with new manager Walter Zenga, whose appointment from Sicilian arch-rivals Catania was greeted with surprise and dismay from supporters of both parties; Zenga&#x27;s reign, however, lasted only 13 games, as he was dismissed on 23 November 2009 due to poor performances, ironically after a 1–1 home tie to Sicilian rivals and Zenga&#x27;s former team, Catania, with former Lazio boss Delio Rossi being appointed at his place. Under the tutelage of Delio Rossi, results dramatically improved, and Palermo established a record of seven consecutive home wins, including wins against Italian giants Milan and Juventus, and emerging as serious contenders for a Champions League spot, which they ultimately lost to Sampdoria by only one point. Such season also launched new emerging stars such as midfielder Javier Pastore and goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who went on to become integral part of their respective international teams.
The 2010–11 season started with Delio Rossi still in charge of the club, and also marked Palermo&#x27;s return into continental football in the form of the UEFA Europa League. Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4–3 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3–1 to Internazionale in the final, in what is considered one of the peak moments of Zamparini&#x27;s period at the club.

===Zamparini&#x27;s later years and Serie B return (2011–2018)===
For the 2011–12 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former Chievo boss Stefano Pioli, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows FC Thun in the Europa League third preliminary round; new head coach Devis Mangia, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the &quot;Rosanero&quot; in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long-term deal at the club. A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced Bortolo Mutti. Palermo arrived 16th in that season.
For the 2012–13 season, Zamparini came with another staff revolution, appointing Giorgio Perinetti as the new director of football and Giuseppe Sannino as the manager, both coming from Siena. A complete squad restructuring, a total five managerial changes and some staff changes (including a short stint with Pietro Lo Monaco as sports director) did not help, and Palermo ended its season in 18th place, being thus relegated to Serie B after nine consecutive seasons in the top flight.

For the new Serie B campaign, Zamparini appointed former Milan and Italy international star Gennaro Gattuso as the new manager, despite him having little prior managerial experience; he was sacked in September 2013, the 28th sacked manager in 11 years. Fortune was reversed rather rapidly, however, as Palermo regained promotion back to Serie A for the 2014–15 season under the guidance of new head coach Giuseppe Iachini, with the &quot;Rosanero&quot; completing a record-breaking Serie B season with 86 points, one more than previous record holders Juventus, Chievo and Sassuolo (all of them in the 22-team Serie B format).

With Iachini confirmed in charge, Palermo played a rather successful 2014–15 Serie A season, narrowly missing on a UEFA Europa League spot also thanks to the all-Argentine striking force of Paulo Dybala and Franco Vázquez.

In 2015–16 season, Palermo started their season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the &quot;Rosanero&quot; therefore relied on senior striker Alberto Gilardino to play as a partner of Vázquez. Another long list of managerial changes during the season (seven in total, with Davide Ballardini as the final one) marked a very troublesome season, during which Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3–2, securing 16th place.

For the 2016–17 season, Zamparini re-appointed Rino Foschi as sporting director; however, he resigned after just a month in charge and was replaced by former Trapani director Daniele Faggiano. Most senior players such as Gilardino, Sorrentino, Vázquez and Maresca were sold and mostly replaced with Alessandro Diamanti plus several young and quasi-unknown foreign players. Ballardini, who was originally confirmed as head coach, left his position after a draw at Inter Milan at the second matchday of the season and was replaced with Serie A newbie Roberto De Zerbi who ended his stay after seven league losses in a row, with former club captain Eugenio Corini taking over. More managerial and staff changes followed with little luck and, on 27 February 2017, Zamparini stepped down as chairman of Palermo after 15 years in charge, announcing he had agreed in principle to sell his controlling stake to an unspecified Anglo-American fund, led by Italian-American Paul Baccaglini who was named new club president on 6 March.

Palermo ended the season in 19th place, being relegated to Serie B. The takeover, originally scheduled to be finalized by 30 April 2017 and then delayed by 30 June, eventually collapsed after Zamparini, who in the meantime had appointed Bruno Tedino as new head coach for the 2017–18 Serie B campaign, rejected the final offer he received from Baccaglini. On 4 July 2017, Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairman, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place.

Palermo&#x27;s campaign in the 2017–18 Serie B aimed for an immediate return to the top flight, with Bruno Tedino as head coach and Fabio Lupo as director of football. Initially, the team&#x27;s form was good, and the &quot;Rosanero&quot; ended the first half of the season in first place; however, a string of negative results led to the appointment of new manager Roberto Stellone, who was ultimately unable to win promotion, ending the regular season in fourth place and eventually losing the playoff finals to Frosinone.

===New ownerships, financial issues and Serie B exclusion (2018–2019)===
For the 2018–19 Serie B season, Palermo (with Rino Foschi back for a third time as sporting director) found themselves having to sell many players for financial reasons. On 22 November 2018, the club formally confirmed a takeover agreement between Zamparini and an undisclosed investor, later confirmed to be the London based Sport Capital Group Investments Ltd., with English businessman Clive Richardson, head of the new group, being named as new club chairman. Following a January 2019 transfer window with no signings at all and serious tensions within the board, Clive Richardson (chairman) and John Treacy (director) both resigned from the club with immediate effect on 4 February 2019, citing that the full nature of the serious financial situation at the club had not been fully disclosed to them at the time of their purchase. Days later, the club was acquired for a nominal fee by Daniela De Angeli (former managing director from the Zamparini days) and Rino Foschi (appointed as chairman), only for them to sell it again to hotel and tourism company Arkus Network S.r.l. later in May. The new owner, Sporting Network S.r.l., subscribed a €5 million capital increase to the club.

At the end of the 2018–19 Serie B, Palermo finished in third place with 63 points but was demoted by FIGC to last place in Serie B on 13 May due to serious financial irregularities, which meant relegation to Serie C for the following season. The club appealed to FIGC against this ruling and were successful in having the penalty revised; rather than automatic demotion, the club was merely docked 20 points instead, which consequently placed them in a comfortable mid-table eleventh position. However, on 24 June 2019, Palermo incorrectly submitted to FIGC their standard application for the following 2019–20 Serie B season, by failing to provide evidence of a valid insurance policy for the new season. A club trading with no insurance is an extremely serious breach of Italian company law, and as such FIGC had no alternative but to formally exclude the club not only from Serie B, but indeed all professional leagues, on 12 July 2019.

===A fresh start, City Football Group ownership (2019–present)===
On 23 July 2019, in compliance of Article 52 of N.O.I.F., Mayor of Palermo Leoluca Orlando confirmed six declarations of interests had been presented for a new phoenix club to be admitted in Serie D, the highest level of non-professional football in Italy, for the 2019–20 season. The next day, Orlando announced his choice of a bid by a company named &quot;Hera Hora srl&quot;, jointly owned by entrepreneurs Dario Mirri (a Palermo native, and Renzo Barbera&#x27;s nephew) and a Sicilian-American, Tony DiPiazza. Palermo completed their Serie D campaign in first place, and was awarded promotion to Serie C by the Italian Football Federation after all the amateur leagues were stopped in March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. On 16 July 2020, the club changed its name to Palermo Football Club.

Palermo, under the guidance of Silvio Baldini, concluded the 2021–22 Serie C campaign in third place in the Group C, behind Bari and Catanzaro, and then made it to the promotion playoff final against Padova after eliminating Triestina, Virtus Entella and Feralpisalò in the process (during playoffs, Renzo Barbera stadium was always sold out). On 12 June 2022, Palermo were promoted to Serie B after defeating Padova 2–0 on aggregate, thus returning to the Italian second division just three years after being excluded from the league. On 4 July 2022, at the presence of Manchester City F.C. CEO Ferran Soriano, the club was formally announced to have been acquired by City Football Group, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi United Group, with outgoing owner Dario Mirri (who was confirmed as club chairman) keeping a 20% of the quotes.

Under new head coach Eugenio Corini, former Palermo captain in the 2000s, the &quot;Rosanero&quot; ended their season in ninth place, missing on promotion playoffs in the season&#x27;s final game. The follow-up season saw Palermo aiming for direct promotion; however, inconsistency in league performances led to the dismissal of Corini and the appointment of Michele Mignani as new head coach for the remainder of the campaign.

==Colours and badge==

The new official badge as of 2019 is a white eagle&#x27;s head and three pink/black feathers within a black stylized letter &#x27;P&#x27;. The eagle represents the city of Palermo, as it is also part of the city&#x27;s official coat of arms. This new badge replaced the long-standing badge of the previous formation of the club, an escutcheon with an eagle poised for flight within it, and the previous official club denomination &quot;U.S. Città di Palermo&quot; in capital letters on the top.

From its foundation, Palermo originally played with a red and blue shirt as its official colours, but decided to switch to the unusual current choice of pink and black on 27 February 1907, contemporaneously with the change of denomination to &quot;Palermo FootBall Club&quot;.

The colour choice of pink and black was suggested by Count Giuseppe Airoldi, a prominent founding member of the club. In a personal letter Airoldi wrote on 2 February 1905 to English club councillor Joseph Whitaker, he defined pink and black poetically as &quot;colours of the bitter and the sweet&quot;, a choice he amusingly asserted to be suited for a team characterised by &quot;results as up and down as a Swiss clock&quot;, noting also the fact that red and blue were a very commonly used choice of colours around Italy at the time.

The club had to wait for their new jerseys for three months, because no pink cotton flannel material was available in Palermo and the appointed tailoring company could only find suitable material from England and had to import it from there. The vivid new shirts were first worn in a friendly match against Sir Thomas Lipton&#x27;s crew team; the match ended in a 2–1 win for Palermo. From 1936 to 1940, the team were forced to play in red and yellow jerseys due to an imposition by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini (red and yellow being the official colours of the municipality of Palermo.) When the club was refounded in 1941 following a merger with Juventina Palermo, they started dressing in light blue shirts on the pitch, but switched back to the very popular pink and black only one year later.

==Stadium==
Palermo plays its home matches at Stadio Renzo Barbera. The stadium was opened in 1932, during the fascist regime, with the name &quot;Stadio Littorio&quot; (after the Italian name for the fasces symbol). The inaugural match, won by Palermo 5–1, was played on 24 January 1932 against Atalanta. In 1936, the Littorio was renamed &quot;Stadio Michele Marrone&quot; after a fascist soldier who died in the Spanish Civil War.

Initially, the stadium featured a running track and no spectator space behind the goals, only terraces and a stand along the side. In 1948, following the end of World War II and the fall of the fascist regime, the stadium was renamed &quot;Stadio La Favorita&quot; after the Favorita neighbourhood where it was located. It was also restructured to remove the running track and add two curved end sections, increasing its capacity to 30,000. In 1984, it was enlarged to 50,000. The new capacity was reached only twice: for a Serie C1 league match against Sicilian rivals Messina and a friendly match against Juventus. On the occasion of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was renovated, some new seats added, but the overall capacity reduced to 37,619. During the 1989 renovation works, five employees died following the collapse of a section of the stadium. In 2002 the stadium was renamed in honour of Renzo Barbera, legendary Palermo chairman in the 1970s.

In 2007, Palermo chairman and owner Maurizio Zamparini announced plans to move the club to a new state-of-the-art stadium, possibly located in the &quot;ZEN&quot; neighbourhood of Palermo, not far from the Velodromo Paolo Borsellino, a smaller stadium that had previously hosted some Palermo matches.

In 2024, Palermo inaugurated their own training centre, located in the city of Torretta, their first one in the club&#x27;s history.

==Supporters==

The majority of Palermo supporters come from the city and its neighbourhood. However, Palermo is also widely popular throughout Western Sicily, as well as among Sicilian immigrants in northern Italy, For example, a number of Palermo fans living in and around the German city of Solingen have even founded a club named &quot;FC Rosaneri&quot; in honour of Palermo which, as of 2007, plays in the Kreisliga B league.

Support for Palermo is traditionally closely associated with a strong sense of Sicilian identity; indeed, it is not uncommon to see Sicilian flags waved by fans and ultras during Palermo matches. Palermo fans are also twinned with Lecce ultras. This friendship was strengthened by the acquisition of Fabrizio Miccoli, who is originally from the city of Lecce and a well-known Lecce supporter who went on to become captain of Palermo and also the club&#x27;s most prolific player, setting records for: most Serie A league goals (74, from 2007 to 2013); most goals in all competitions (81, from 2007 to 2013); and most Serie A league appearances (165, from 2007 to 2013).

Palermo&#x27;s biggest rivals are fellow islanders Catania. Matches between Palermo and Catania are usually referred to as Sicilian derbies, despite the existence of a third Sicilian team, Messina, who played in Serie A alongside Palermo and Catania in recent years. Rivalry with Messina, although historically older, is generally less intense than that with Catania.

The 2006–07 return match between Palermo and Catania, played on 2 February 2007 at Stadio Angelo Massimino, Catania, is remembered due to the death of policeman Filippo Raciti who was injured during riots between the local police and the Catania supporters.

According to a survey of 2008, the team has about 1.47 million fans domestically, placing it among the top ten best-supported Italian teams. For example, at the Coppa Italia final played in Rome on 29 May 2011 against Inter, which Palermo lost 3–1, it was estimated that there were 25,000 - 35,000 fans from Palermo, easily outnumbering the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; fans present.

<text>Lisa Ekdahl (born 29 July 1971 in Hägersten, Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish popular music singer and songwriter. She has so far released 10 albums, most of them in Swedish, but some entirely in English. Her voice has been described as &quot;child-like&quot; and &quot;soft, supple and smooth&quot;.

==Career==
In 1994, at the age of 22, Ekdahl became famous overnight in Sweden with her self-titled debut album and the No. 1 hit single &quot;Vem vet&quot; (&quot;Who Knows?&quot;). The record sold almost 800,000 copies and she was awarded three Swedish music prizes, one of them as the nation&#x27;s best artist of the year. She also enjoyed success in Denmark and Norway.

She signed with EMI Records, but later recorded two pop albums with RCA/BMG: &quot;Med Kroppen Mot Jorden&quot; and &quot;Bortom Det Blå&quot; in 1996 and 1997. In 1998, she recorded the English language album &quot;When Did You Leave Heaven&quot;, which contained jazz standards. Ekdahl has been focusing on, with great success, Scandinavia and Europe (most noticeably France), leaving little mark in other countries such as the United States. Her following album, &quot;Back To Earth&quot; (1999), was again full of jazz standards and, like her jazz debut, recorded with the Peter Nordahl Trio. In France alone, it sold over 40,000 copies. She received positive reviews for her live appearances in Great Britain from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Ekdahl&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Lisa Ekdahl sings Salvadore Poe&quot; (2000), signaled a new direction and critical esteem. As the new album&#x27;s title indicates, Ekdahl exclusively sings songs written by her husband, also known as Paul DiBartolo, guitarist in New York glam metal band Spread Eagle, primarily in the bossa nova style. Her fragile and childish voice seems to be made for this type of music. Their album was a great success in France and Scandinavia, where it sold over 120,000 copies by early 2001.

Her voice is variously compared to Blossom Dearie, Diana Krall, and perhaps most accurately, Astrud Gilberto. Her hit song &quot;Vem Vet&quot; is also in the soundtrack of the Korean drama &quot;Love Rain&quot;.

In 2016 she participated in the music show &quot;Så mycket bättre&quot; broadcast on TV4.

==Personal life==
She was born in Hägersten, Sweden to her parents who were a nuclear physicist and kindergarten teacher. She was raised just outside Mariefred, Sweden. She has two sisters and attended school at the Tälje Musikgymnasium. Her music is published by her company Lisa Ekdahl AB.

Ekdahl has lived in New York City. In 1999, she met American composer and guitarist Salvadore Poe, former guitarist of 1990s New York sleaze rockers Spread Eagle on a flight to India. They married in 2000, and they later collaborated on an album together. They are now divorced. She was previously married to Swedish singer Bill Öhrström, with whom she has a son Milton (born 23 December 1994). She also has a daughter born in 2012.

She currently lives in the Södermalm district of Stockholm.

<text>The vibraslap is a percussion instrument consisting of a piece of stiff wire (bent into a U-shape) connecting a wooden ball to a hollow box of wood with metal &quot;teeth&quot; inside. The percussionist holds the metal wire in one hand and strikes the ball (usually against the palm of their other hand). The box acts as a resonating body for a metal mechanism placed inside with a number of loosely fastened pins or rivets that vibrate and rattle against the box. The instrument is a modern version of the jawbone.

==History==
The vibraslap comes from the African jawbone instrument. This is the lower jawbone of a donkey or a zebra which has loose teeth that rattle when the instrument is struck. The instrument was carried by enslaved people to South America where it became known as the jawbone (quijada in Spanish). It became used in Latin American music in the ensuing centuries. 

The modern vibraslap was invented by Martin Cohen in 1967. Cohen was told by percussionist Bobby Rosengarden, &quot;If you want to make some money, make a jawbone that doesn&#x27;t break.&quot; About the inventing process, Cohen remembers, &quot;I had never seen a jawbone before, but I had heard one on a Cal Tjader album. I found out that it was an animal skull that you would strike, and the sound would come from the teeth-rattling in the loose sockets. So I took that concept and invented the Vibraslap, which was my first patent.&quot; The vibraslap was the first patent granted to the instrument manufacturing company Latin Percussion.

<text>The quijada, charrasca, or jawbone (in English) is an idiophone percussion instrument made from the jawbone of a donkey, horse, mule, or cattle, producing a powerful buzzing sound. 
The jawbone is cleaned of tissue and dried to make the teeth loose and act as a rattle.
It is used in music in most of Latin America, including Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Cuba. It was also historically used in the early American minstrel show.

==Technique==

To play it, a musician holds one end in one hand and strikes the other with either a stick or their hand; this causes the teeth to rattle against the bone creating a loud, untuned sound, specific to this instrument. The stick can also be pulled along the teeth which act as a rasp. These ingredients provide the basis for a wide variety of combinations and rhythms.

== Historical and cultural content ==

While it is used in most of Latin America, the quijada originated from the Africans that were brought to the Americas during the colonial era. It is believed that it was first introduced in Peru, making it an Afro-Peruvian instrument.
It is a mix of African and indigenous cultures that created an instrument that gained value from the people of Latin America. It is one of the main instruments used by Afro-Peruvian musical ensembles and is used in many other Latin American cultures, like the candombe of Argentina (in Uruguay it is not used), Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, as well as Belizean &quot;brukdown&quot;, Mexican music by son jarocho, and &quot;Costa Chica&quot; ensembles. An example is a song played in Oaxaca, Mexico in which the &quot;quijada&quot; keeps the beat. The &quot;quijada de burro&quot; (&quot;quijada&quot; made of donkey jaw) is most often used at carnivals and religious festivals.
In popular culture the use of a quijada was shown in a conga dance scene in a 1939 film (&quot;Midnight&quot; starring Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche) beginning at 54:35.

<text>In statistics, a sampling distribution or finite-sample distribution is the probability distribution of a given random-sample-based statistic. For an arbitrarily large number of samples where each sample, involving multiple observations (data points), is separately used to compute one value of a statistic (for example, the sample mean or sample variance) per sample, the sampling distribution is the probability distribution of the values that the statistic takes on. In many contexts, only one sample (i.e., a set of observations) is observed, but the sampling distribution can be found theoretically.

Sampling distributions are important in statistics because they provide a major simplification en route to statistical inference. More specifically, they allow analytical considerations to be based on the probability distribution of a statistic, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all the individual sample values.

==Introduction==
The sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of that statistic, considered as a random variable, when derived from a random sample of size formula_1. It may be considered as the distribution of the statistic for &quot;all possible samples from the same population&quot; of a given sample size. The sampling distribution depends on the underlying distribution of the population, the statistic being considered, the sampling procedure employed, and the sample size used. There is often considerable interest in whether the sampling distribution can be approximated by an asymptotic distribution, which corresponds to the limiting case either as the number of random samples of finite size, taken from an infinite population and used to produce the distribution, tends to infinity, or when just one equally-infinite-size &quot;sample&quot; is taken of that same population.

For example, consider a normal population with mean formula_2 and variance formula_3. Assume we repeatedly take samples of a given size from this population and calculate the arithmetic mean formula_4 for each sample – this statistic is called the sample mean. The distribution of these means, or averages, is called the &quot;sampling distribution of the sample mean&quot;. This distribution is normal formula_5 (&quot;n&quot; is the sample size) since the underlying population is normal, although sampling distributions may also often be close to normal even when the population distribution is not (see central limit theorem). An alternative to the sample mean is the sample median. When calculated from the same population, it has a different sampling distribution to that of the mean and is generally not normal (but it may be close for large sample sizes).

The mean of a sample from a population having a normal distribution is an example of a simple statistic taken from one of the simplest statistical populations. For other statistics and other populations the formulas are more complicated, and often they do not exist in closed-form. In such cases the sampling distributions may be approximated through Monte-Carlo simulations, bootstrap methods, or asymptotic distribution theory.

==Standard error==

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic is referred to as the
standard error of that quantity. For the case where the statistic is the sample mean, and samples are uncorrelated, the standard error is:
formula_6
where formula_7 is the standard deviation of the population distribution of that quantity and formula_1 is the sample size (number of items in the sample).

An important implication of this formula is that the sample size must be quadrupled (multiplied by 4) to achieve half (1/2) the measurement error. When designing statistical studies where cost is a factor, this may have a role in understanding cost–benefit tradeoffs.

For the case where the statistic is the sample total, and samples are uncorrelated, the standard error is:
formula_9
where, again, formula_7 is the standard deviation of the population distribution of that quantity and formula_1 is the sample size (number of items in the sample).

<doc id="520674" wikidata="Q929043" url="?curid=520674" title="Geostrophic wind">
<text>In atmospheric science, geostrophic flow () is the theoretical wind that would result from an exact balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. This condition is called &quot;geostrophic equilibrium&quot; or &quot;geostrophic balance&quot; (also known as &quot;geostrophy&quot;). The geostrophic wind is directed parallel to isobars (lines of constant pressure at a given height). This balance seldom holds exactly in nature. The true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground. Thus, the actual wind would equal the geostrophic wind only if there were no friction (e.g. above the atmospheric boundary layer) and the isobars were perfectly straight. Despite this, much of the atmosphere outside the tropics is close to geostrophic flow much of the time and it is a valuable first approximation. Geostrophic flow in air or water is a zero-frequency inertial wave.

==Origin==

A useful heuristic is to imagine air starting from rest, experiencing a force directed from areas of high pressure toward areas of low pressure, called the pressure gradient force. If the air began to move in response to that force, however, the Coriolis force would deflect it, to the right of the motion in the northern hemisphere or to the left in the southern hemisphere. As the air accelerated, the deflection would increase until the Coriolis force&#x27;s strength and direction balanced the pressure gradient force, a state called geostrophic balance. At this point, the flow is no longer moving from high to low pressure, but instead moves along isobars. Geostrophic balance helps to explain why, in the northern hemisphere, low-pressure systems (or &quot;cyclones&quot;) spin counterclockwise and high-pressure systems (or &quot;anticyclones&quot;) spin clockwise, and the opposite in the southern hemisphere.

==Geostrophic currents==
Flow of ocean water is also largely geostrophic. Just as multiple weather balloons that measure pressure as a function of height in the atmosphere are used to map the atmospheric pressure field and infer the geostrophic wind, measurements of density as a function of depth in the ocean are used to infer geostrophic currents. Satellite altimeters are also used to measure sea surface height anomaly, which permits a calculation of the geostrophic current at the surface.

==Limitations of the geostrophic approximation==

The effect of friction, between the air and the land, breaks the geostrophic balance. Friction slows the flow, lessening the effect of the Coriolis force. As a result, the pressure gradient force has a greater effect and the air still moves from high pressure to low pressure, though with great deflection. This explains why high-pressure system winds radiate out from the center of the system, while low-pressure systems have winds that spiral inwards.

The geostrophic wind neglects frictional effects, which is usually a good approximation for the synoptic scale instantaneous flow in the midlatitude mid-troposphere. Although ageostrophic terms are relatively small, they are essential for the time evolution of the flow and in particular are necessary for the growth and decay of storms. Quasigeostrophic and semi geostrophic theory are used to model flows in the atmosphere more widely. These theories allow for a divergence to take place and for weather systems to then develop.

==Formulation==
Newton&#x27;s Second Law can be written as follows if only the pressure gradient, gravity, and friction act on an air parcel, where bold symbols are vectors:

:formula_1

Here U is the velocity field of the air, Ω is the angular velocity vector of the planet, &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of the air, P is the air pressure, Fr is the friction, g is the acceleration vector due to gravity and is the material derivative.

Locally this can be expanded in Cartesian coordinates, with a positive &quot;u&quot; representing an eastward direction and a positive &quot;v&quot; representing a northward direction. Neglecting friction and vertical motion, as justified by the Taylor–Proudman theorem, we have:

:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4

With the Coriolis parameter (approximately , varying with latitude).

Assuming geostrophic balance, the system is stationary and the first two equations become:

:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7

By substituting using the third equation above, we have:

:formula_8

with &quot;z&quot; the geopotential height of the constant pressure surface, satisfying

:formula_9

Further simplify those formulae above:

formula_10

This leads us to the following result for the geostrophic wind components:

formula_11

formula_12

The validity of this approximation depends on the local Rossby number. It is invalid at the equator, because &quot;f&quot; is equal to zero there, and therefore generally not used in the tropics.

Other variants of the equation are possible; for example, the geostrophic wind vector can be expressed in terms of the gradient of the geopotential Φ on a surface of constant pressure:

:formula_13

<text>Sir Francis Charles Chichester KBE (17 September 1901 – 26 August 1972) was a British businessman, pioneering aviator and solo sailor.

He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for becoming the first person to sail single-handed around the world by the clipper route and the fastest circumnavigator, in nine months and one day overall in 1966–67.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Chichester was born in the rectory at Shirwell near Barnstaple in Devon, England, the son of a Church of England clergyman, Charles Chichester, himself the seventh son of Sir Arthur Chichester, 8th Baronet. His mother was Emily Annie, daughter of Samuel Page. At the age of six he was sent as a boarder to The Old Ride Preparatory School for boys, then attended Marlborough College during World War I. At the age of eighteen Chichester emigrated to New Zealand where in ten years he built up a prosperous business in forestry, mining and property development, only to suffer severe losses in the Great Depression.

===Aviator===
After returning to England in 1929 to visit his family, Chichester took flying lessons at Brooklands, Surrey, and qualified as a pilot. He then took delivery of a de Havilland Gipsy Moth aircraft, which he intended to fly to New Zealand, hoping to break Bert Hinkler&#x27;s record solo flight back to Australia on the way. While mechanical problems meant that the record eluded him, he completed the trip in 41 days. The aircraft was then shipped to New Zealand. Finding that he was unable to carry enough fuel to cross the Tasman Sea directly, Chichester had his Gipsy Moth fitted with floats borrowed from the New Zealand Permanent Air Force, and went on to make the first solo flight across the Tasman Sea from East to West (New Zealand to Australia). He was the first to land an aircraft at Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. Again, the trip was delayed: after his aircraft was severely damaged at Lord Howe, he had to rebuild it himself with the help of islanders.

Though the concept of &quot;off-course navigation&quot; (steering to one side so you know which way the error is) is probably as old as navigation, Chichester was the first to use it in a methodical manner in an aircraft. His only method of fixing his position was to take sun sights with a sextant. As a solo pilot, this was a difficult thing to do in a moving aircraft, as he needed to fly the aircraft at the same time. After the sun sight was taken, he had to make calculations by long-hand. As all this could be unreliable, Chichester needed an alternative. When he reached a point at which the sun was at a calculated altitude above the horizon, the pilot then made a 90-degree turn to the left (or right as calculated) and then flew along this line until the destination was reached. Since he did not know in advance when he would arrive at a line of position passing through his destination, he calculated a table or graph of the Sun&#x27;s altitude and azimuth at his destination for a range of times bracketing his ETA. The advantage of this method was that the effects of drift were reduced to errors in distance travelled, usually much smaller. Since Chichester arrived at Lord Howe Island in the afternoon, the Sun was to his north-west when he made his turn. Some hours before making his turn, close to local noon when the Sun was to his north, Chichester made two observations with his sextant to check his dead-reckoning course.

The general principle was, when the Sun is to the right or left of one&#x27;s course one can check the course but not distance to the destination. When the Sun is ahead or behind one&#x27;s course, the distance to one&#x27;s destination can be checked but not one&#x27;s course. Chichester planned his final approach to follow a line of position directly to his destination. This technique allowed him to find tiny islands in the Pacific. He was awarded the inaugural Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Johnston Memorial Trophy for this trip. Chichester then decided to circumnavigate the world solo; he made it to Japan but at Katsuura, Chiba, he collided with an overhead cable, sustaining serious injuries.

===Second World War cartography===
Unable to join the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of the Second World War due to age and eyesight, he was not granted a commission until 14 March 1941 when he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve for the duration of hostilities. His civil occupation was listed as Air Navigation Specialist. His first posting was to the Air Ministry in the Navigation section of the Directorate of Air Member Training, where he served until August 1942. In July 1943 he was sent to the Empire Central Flying School where he instructed in navigation until released in September 1945. He wrote the navigation manual that allowed the pilots of single-handed fighter aircraft to navigate across Europe and back using kneeboard navigation similar to that which he had used in the Pacific.

At the end of the war, he stayed in the United Kingdom. He purchased 15,000 surplus Air Ministry maps, initially pasting them onto boards and making jigsaw puzzles out of them, and later founded his own successful map-making company.

===Yachtsman===
In 1958, Chichester was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. (This might have been a misdiagnosis; David Lewis, a London doctor, who competed against Chichester in the first solo trans-Atlantic race, reviewed his case and called Chichester&#x27;s abnormality a &quot;lung abscess&quot;.) His wife Sheila put him on a strict vegetarian diet (now considered to be a macrobiotic diet) and his cancer went into remission. Chichester then turned to long-distance yachting.

In 1960, he entered and won the first Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, which had been founded by &#x27;Blondie&#x27; Hasler, in the 40 foot ocean racing yawl &quot;Gipsy Moth III&quot;. He came second in the second race four years later.

On 27 August 1966 Chichester sailed his ketch &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; from Plymouth in the United Kingdom and returned there after 226 days of sailing on 28 May 1967, having circumnavigated the globe, with one stop (in Sydney). By doing so, he became the first person to achieve a true circumnavigation of the world solo from West to East via the great Capes. The voyage was also a race against the clock, as Chichester wanted to beat the typical times achieved by the fastest fully crewed clipper ships during the heyday of commercial sail in the 19th century. His global voyage was the first to be commercially sponsored, with the International Wool Secretariat&#x27;s Woolmark featured on the bows of &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; and Chichester&#x27;s baseball cap.

===Honours and later life===
In 1961, he was awarded the Harold Spencer-Jones Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of Navigation in recognition of his contributions to navigation.

In July 1967, a few weeks after his solo circumnavigation, Chichester was knighted, being appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for &quot;individual achievement and sustained endeavour in the navigation and seamanship of small craft&quot;. For the ceremony, the Queen used the sword used by her predecessor Queen Elizabeth I to knight the adventurer Sir Francis Drake, the first Englishman with his crew to complete a circumnavigation. &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; was preserved alongside the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; at Greenwich.

Also in 1967, Sir Francis Chichester was made an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple after his solo circumnavigation of the globe in 1966–67. An occasional table, located in the Prince&#x27;s Room, commemorates Chichester&#x27;s association with the Inn which is held in the Prince&#x27;s Room. It is made from the teak forehatch of Gypsy Moth IV, his own craft, and contains an aeronautical chart of the South Atlantic. The hatch cover from his yacht is also displayed in the Prince&#x27;s Room.

Chichester was also honoured in 1967 by a newly issued 1/9d (one shilling and nine pence) postage stamp, which showed him aboard &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot;. This went against an unwritten tradition of the General Post Office, because Chichester was neither a member of the royal family nor dead when the stamp was issued.

In 1968, when Donald Crowhurst was trying to win the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Golden Globe Race, a single-handed round-the-world event, it was Chichester who dismissed Crowhurst&#x27;s wildly exaggerated reports of his own progress, which had fooled many enthusiastic supporters.

In 1970, Chichester attempted to sail 4,000 miles in twenty days, in &quot;Gipsy Moth V&quot;, but failed by one day.

Chichester died of cancer in Plymouth, Devon, on 26 August 1972, and was buried in the church of his ancestors, St Peter&#x27;s Church in Shirwell, near Barnstaple. His widow died in 1989 and is buried with him.

==Family==

Sir Francis Chichester had two sons, George and Giles. His older son George died in 1968 of an asthma attack. His younger son, Giles Chichester, was for many years a British politician, and Conservative Member of the European Parliament for South West England and Gibraltar.

==Other posthumous honours==
Norfolk Island issued a stamp, (2c) in 1981, commemorating the first landing of an aircraft on the Island, Chichester&#x27;s Gipsy Moth &quot;Madame Elijah&quot;, at Cascade Bay on 28 March 1931. Another stamp (14 cents) was issued by Norfolk Island in 1974 showing Chichester&#x27;s seaplane. Australia Post issued a Pre Stamped Envelope in 1981 commemorating the Tasman Flight. Great Britain issued a further stamp (47p) in 2003 featuring Chichester. Additionally both Palau and Qatar have issued stamps featuring Chichester.

A memorial plaque to Chichester was unveiled at the family home at 9 St James&#x27;s Place, SW1 in September 1993.

<text>Research is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Research recorded a population of 2,695 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Settled in the 1850s, Research was the location of extensive orchards by the 1860s. The unusual name arose from the gold rush era in Victoria, during the mid 19th century. Research was then known as Swiper&#x27;s Gully, but gold was found after the area was re-searched. Swiper&#x27;s Gully then became Research Gully, and finally, late in the 19th century, abbreviated to Research.

Research Post Office opened on 20 October 1902.

==Community==

Much of Research today consists of 1- to 35-acre blocks. This area has one of the highest bushfire risks in Australia, due to prolific Eucalyptus and Melaleuca Paperbark trees. Consequently, a diverse variety of fauna and flora exist in this ecologically protected zone.

Research has a variety of facilities, including the Research Football Club, Scout Hall, Tennis Club, Research CFA, Eltham Little Theatre, Balance Gymnastics Club, Eltham Martial Arts Gym and Micky&#x27;s Fitness Gym.

The nearest public library is Eltham Library, operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library.

==Education==

The schools in Research include Eltham College and Research Primary School. Eltham College comprises both a junior and senior school.

Eltham College and Research Primary are both situated on Main Road.

==Sport==

Research is the home of the Research Junior Football Club, which competes in the Northern Football League. They play their home games at Research Park, located on Main Road, Research. Research Cricket Club and Eltham Collegians Cricket Club were both Diamond Valley Cricket Association teams based in Research, until they merged in 2010 to form one club. Their home games are played at Research Park and Eltham College Oval. Research Baseball Club, which plays in the Melbourne Winter Baseball League, are based in Research, but play their home games in Lower Plenty. Research Tennis Club play their home games at the Research Park Tennis Courts.

<doc id="520702" wikidata="Q781121" url="?curid=520702" title="Austin Maestro">
<text>The Austin Maestro is a five-door hatchback small family car (and two-door van derivative) that was produced from November 1982 to 1986 by British Leyland, and from 1986 until December 1994 by Rover Group, as a replacement for the Austin Maxi and Austin Allegro, with the van version replacing the corresponding van derivative of the Morris Ital. The car was produced at Morris&#x27; former Oxford plant, also known as Cowley, with 605,000 units sold. Today, the redeveloped factory builds the BMW Mini. An MG-branded performance version was sold as the MG Maestro from 1983 until 1991.

Although later models were sometimes referred to as the Rover Maestro, the model never wore the Rover badge. The Austin Montego saloon was a variant of the Maestro.

==Background==

British Leyland was created in 1975 when the bankrupt British Leyland Motor Corporation was nationalised. In 1977 the South African-born corporate troubleshooter, Michael Edwardes, was recruited as chairman to sort out the troubled firm. Part of Edwardes&#x27; plan was to introduce a completely new range of mass-market models to replace the current offerings, designed and built using state-of-the-art technology. The new range eventually decided upon consisted of a new vehicle for each of the small, lower-medium and upper-medium market segments. The first of these cars to be launched was the Austin Metro in 1980.

==Design and development==
The new cars for the lower and upper medium segments were to share a platform, with various trim and styling differences to distinguish the two different models. The two models would in effect replace four existing vehicles in the British Leyland range – the Maestro would simultaneously replace both the Austin Allegro and Maxi, whilst the Montego replaced the Austin Ambassador and Morris Ital, these latter two having been recent facelifts of the Princess and Morris Marina. Since all but the Allegro were made at the Cowley plant, this rationalization would give the cost benefits of production automation and flexibility. This common platform was given the project name LC10, using the Leyland Cars project sequence (LC8 became the Austin Mini Metro on its launch in 1980, LC9 became the Triumph Acclaim when it was launched in 1981). Preliminary design work for LC10 began in 1977, with production scheduled to begin around 1980 – which would have seen it go on sale around the same time as the Ford Escort MK3 and the original Vauxhall Astra.

LC10 was styled by Ian Beech under the direction of BL designer David Bache. Two main body variations were provided: a five-door hatchback and a four-door notchback. It was a departure from previous front-wheel drive cars from the company in dispensing with the famous Issigonis transmission-in-sump powertrain that had been pioneered in the Mini. Coupled to the A- and R-series powerplants was an end-on transmission (as pioneered by Fiat with the Autobianchi Primula), bought from Volkswagen. The sophisticated Hydragas suspension system used on previous BL models was sacrificed on cost grounds, with a conventional MacPherson strut system at the front and a Volkswagen Golf-style torsion beam at the rear being used instead – but with long travel rising rate springs. While easier to build, this suspension did compromise load space. Prototypes were even tested with actual Golf suspension components. This may have led to the early cars being prone to front wheel bearing issues. The Maestro was larger and heavier than the first VW Golf.

It was decided that the five-door hatchback version would be engineered first. It was given its own project designation, LM10, with this version to be launched as the Austin Maestro. The name &quot;Maestro&quot; had been a finalist when the Austin Metro was being named, with the third choice (&quot;Match&quot;) never picked up. The booted notchback version was to follow and it was designated as LM11, although its development was to diverge from the original path, it was later launched as the Austin Montego on its launch in April 1984, following British Leyland&#x27;s decision to discontinue the Morris marque.

Production began in November 1982, and the car was officially launched on 1 March 1983. The wheelbase was , and the length was .

Aerodynamic drag factor stood at 0.38 Cd for most models, bar HLE and MG models which were 0.36 Cd respectively. The rear strakes on the tailgate of these models enabled a cleaner break away of the air flow round the back of the car. This is what largely contributed to this improved figure.

==Novel features==
The Maestro incorporated many novel and pioneering features for its class. It had a bonded laminated windscreen, homofocal headlamps, body-coloured plastic bumpers, an electronic engine management system, adjustable front seat belt upper anchorage positions, an asymmetrically split rear seat, and a service interval. Another noteworthy point of interest at the time was the &#x27;white lamp&#x27; indicators, rather than the traditional orange; the norm today. The MG and Vanden Plas versions had solid-state instrumentation with digital speedometer and vacuum fluorescent analogue displays for tachometer, fuel and temperature gauges, trip computer and a voice synthesis warning and information system. The analogue instrument pod fitted to lower models was later used in the Range Rover from 1985 onwards.

==Reception==

The Maestro was launched in March 1983. In its summing up of the new car the Consumers&#x27; Association, in the June edition of its &quot;Which?&quot; journal, described it as roomy, comfortable, and nice to drive, and said &quot;If you are considering buying one now, our advice, based on our first impressions, is to go ahead&quot;. In January 1984, after testing the car, they concluded: &quot;In comparison with opposition of a similar price and body size, the Maestro has a clear advantage on room for passengers, with few cars equalling it for comfort either in the front or back&quot;. They also considered it to be a serious rival to the higher-segment Vauxhall Cavalier and Ford Sierra, apart from its smaller boot space.

The original lineup consisted of the 1.3-litre base, L, and HLE models, the 1.6-litre L, HLS, and Vanden Plas, and the sporty MG Maestro. The HLE model had a somewhat downtuned engine and received Volkswagen&#x27;s &quot;monstrously long-geared&quot; 3+E transmission to maximize fuel economy, at the cost of severe performance loss. To further improve the HLE&#x27;s economy, it was fitted with an econometer and the same black rubber fins along the sides of the rear windshield as was the MG Maestro. The base model forwent the other versions&#x27; plastic bumpers, instead being fitted with black-painted steel units. The plastic bumpers were the first of their kind, being made from polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), allowing them to be painted and then oven cured at the same high temperature as the car&#x27;s steel body. The 1.6 HLS and Vanden Plas received a 4+E gearbox (a five-speed with a particularly long top gear), while the MG&#x27;s closer ratio five-speed box derived from that of the Golf GTi. A trip computer with a voice synthesizer was standard on the MG and Vanden Plas models, with the Vanden Plas also benefitting from bronze-tinted windows, power locks, and power windows for the front doors.

==Later developments==
The car was a reasonable success, but not as much as beleaguered BL had hoped. It was Britain&#x27;s sixth best selling car in 1983 and 1984, with more than 80,000 sales in its second year. After the &quot;boom&quot; years of 1986 and 1987, Maestro sales went into decline. An early reputation for poor build quality and unreliability did not help. The biggest problems centred around the 1.6-litre R-series engine, which was a hurriedly modified BMC E-series engine from the Austin Maxi because the under-developed S-series unit was not yet ready for production. R-series units suffered from hot starting problems and premature crankshaft failure. This was particularly evident in the MG Maestro 1600, which was included in the original 1983 model range but discontinued the following year.

The new S-series engine eventually appeared in July 1984, and was fitted to all existing 1.6-litre Maestros. The new S-series engine also came fitted with electronic ignition. At the same time, some minor equipment upgrades were made across the range. The 1.3-litre base model gained head restraints, a passenger door mirror and a radio. The 1.3-litre HLE, 1.6-litre automatic and 1.6 HLS all gained a radio-cassette player.

In October 1984, there were more equipment upgrades made across the range. The 1.3 base models gained reclining front seats, door bins, locking fuel filler caps and clocks. The L models gained cloth door trim, upgraded upholstery, and remote-adjustable driver&#x27;s side door mirrors; the 1.6 Ls gained five-speed gearboxes. The 1.3 HLEs gained five-speed &quot;4+E&quot; gearboxes with overdrive fifth gear ratios, side mouldings, tweed cloth upholstery and remotely adjustable passenger&#x27;s side door mirrors. The HLS and 1.6 automatics gained tinted glass, central locking, electric front windows, velour upholstery and upgraded radio-cassette players. The MG Maestros gained electronic fuel-injected versions of the 2-litre O-series engine, uprated suspension and ventilated front disc brakes, colour-keyed exterior trim, tinted glass, central locking and leather-trimmed steering wheels. The new MG Maestro offered much better performance and refinement than its predecessor.

Also in October 1984, the existing Maestro line-up was joined by the 1.3 HL and 1.6 HL. These models fitted between the L and HLE models.

August 1985 saw the arrival of the 1.3 City and 1.3 City X. The 1.3 City was similar to the previous 1.3 base model. The 1.3 City X added full carpeting, cloth upholstery, head restraints, a rear parcel shelf, a radio and a manually operated choke. These models also did without the plastic bumpers, having more conventional steel bumpers with plastic end caps similar to the Maestro van.
The original dashboard was of a multi-piece construction, and gained a reputation for being flimsy and prone to squeaks and rattles, so in February 1986, this was replaced with the more conventional dashboard from the Montego and in the change the voice synthesis unit (prone to reliability issues) was dropped. At the same time more minor equipment upgrades were made across the range. The City X gained door bins and rear wash-wipe. The L and LE gained tweed trim. The HL and automatic gained velour trim and additional brightwork. The Vanden Plas gained leather trim and uprated electronic stereo system.

BL was sold to British Aerospace in 1988, when the Austin badges were discontinued. The range was sustained by the noisy but economical direct injection naturally aspirated Perkins diesel unit launched the previous year. However, without a turbo this model was rather slow. The diesel had already been available in the Maestro van since 1986.

The MG Maestro Turbo, fitted with a turbocharged version of the 2.0 fuel-injected engine from the MG Maestro EFi, was unveiled at the Motor Show in October 1988 and went on sale on 17 March 1989. It was one of the fastest production hatchbacks in the world with a top speed of , making it faster than the Ford Escort XR3i and RS Turbo, as well as the Volkswagen Golf GTI.

After the launch of the new Rover 200 in October 1989, the Maestro was repositioned as a budget entry-level model, with only the base specification models remaining in production while the MG variants were discontinued in 1991. Production had peaked at more than 101,000 units in 1983, and as late as 1989 nearly 60,000 were made. Most sales were in the United Kingdom, where it peaked as the sixth best selling car with more than 80,000 sales in 1984, but by 1989 sales had halved and it was the 19th best seller.

However, production figures fell to 38,762 for 1990, more than halving the following year to 18,450. 1991 was also the year that the MG-badged versions finished production, their place effectively being filled in the Rover range by faster versions of the 200-series hatchback.

In 1992, the high revving Rover MDi / Perkins Prima turbo diesel unit from the Montego was launched, in the now reduced Maestro range (after the launch of the Rover 200/400), as a Clubman with steel bumpers or DLX with plastic bumpers. The turbo improved refinement, as well as performance, at no cost to fuel economy. It was very competitively priced, it was about the same price as the Rover Metro and Peugeot 205 non-turbo diesel superminis that were a size smaller. The only other engine option was the elderly 1.3-litre A series.

In 1987, after an endurance test of 50,000 kilometers with an Austin Maestro 1.6 Mayfair, the Dutch car magazine Autovisie wrote that they &#x27;can state without reservation that today&#x27;s Austins have the same level of quality as other, more selling manufacturers. The Maestro appears to be a good alternative for someone who wants to distinguish himself from the average Escort/Golf/Kadett brigade.&#x27;

In June 1987, the Automobile Association (AA) came to the following conclusion in the car magazine Your Car Magazine: &#x27;The Maestro is a reliable vehicle which has improved over the years.&#x27;

In June 1989, Autocar &amp; Motor wrote: &#x27;The latest Maestro&#x27;s are well-built cars, comfortable to drive and still, after all these years, blessed with that fine handling/ ride combination. Like the Montego, they&#x27;re much underrated.&#x27;

In 1993, &quot;What Car?&quot; buyers&#x27; guide section said: &quot;Yes, its old, but nowadays it&#x27;s also very cheap. Popularity of noisy but economical and surprisingly rapid turbodiesel is what keeps this roomy car going.&quot;

Also in 1993, the Automobile Association road tested the turbo diesel. Their verdict: &quot;You&#x27;re hardly likely to buy a Maestro diesel to improve your street cred! For turning heads, the 218/418 diesel is a much better proposition. However, disinterested passengers love the back seat, while the driver can relish the model&#x27;s marked reluctance to visit filling stations. Here&#x27;s a hatchback for buyers who are really serious about the substance rather than the image – and with a price tag that&#x27;s thousands of pounds lower than most of its rivals (shown in our comparison chart), you start saving even before your first forecourt stop. Unless you&#x27;re averse to gearchanging, this unpretentious Maestro turbo-diesel, at its competitive price, can&#x27;t seriously be faulted.&quot;

In 1993, however, production fell to just over 7,000 units and in its final year, 1994, just over 4,000 were produced, the last one rolling off the production line in December. The chassis development for the Maestro and Montego&#x27;s rear suspension was used as a basis for later Rover cars, and was well regarded.

In 1994, the Maestro finished in 26th place in the JD Power Survey broadcast by Top Gear. This clearly left the model above more recently appeared competitors such as the Volkswagen Golf (52nd), Vauxhall Astra (59th) and the Ford Escort (61st).

In September 1995 production was transferred to Varna, Bulgaria, in complete knock down (CKD) kit form. Around 2,000 vehicles were produced before the company (Rodacar AD) ceased production in April 1996 due to high import costs of the components and little demand for the cars. The majority of the Maestros produced were exported to other countries, including the UK. A small number of these were sold by Apple 2000 Ltd of Bury St Edmunds, and registered on an &quot;N&quot; prefix.
In 1997, Parkway Services of Ledbury, Herefordshire, purchased a batch of 621 Maestro cars and vans in CKD kit form. These had been stored at Cowley, Oxfordshire, since their production in mid-1996, when they became surplus to requirements. The company built up the cars and converted the majority of them to RHD form using up Rover&#x27;s supply of parts. The National Database for Motoring Insurance has records of models registered between &quot;R&quot; and &quot;51&quot; number plates, meaning the overall period of Maestro availability, new in the United Kingdom, was from 1983 to 2001.

In 1998 the Maestro was relaunched in the UK, by Wheeler International Ltd. Sold by Apple 2000 in Bury St Edmunds, Maestros were imported from Bulgaria and sold in the UK, France &amp; Spain, these were the last factory examples available for sale. On 10 February 2001 in The Independent&#x27;s Edition of Your Money, Apple 2000 and the Maestro were Featured on the front page. In the Motoring section James Ruppert reports &quot;FANCY a brand new Maestro?&quot; you can have one for just £4299 and all remaining cars are appropriately finished in black.

The tooling was then sold to First Automobile Works (FAW) in China, where the Maestro was available to the Chinese motoring market in both hatchback and van models. A new addition to the range was the FAW Lubao CA6410 – a Maestro hatch with a Montego front end. A handful of Chinese-made parts were imported into Britain whilst these cars were in production, which itself ended in 2005.

==MG versions==

===MG Maestro 1600 (1983–1984)===
Rushed into production against engineers&#x27; advice at the launch in March 1983, the original MG Maestro was under-developed. Its 1.6-litre R-series engine ran roughly, was difficult to start when warm, and its Weber twin carburettors could not always be properly tuned by dealership workshops, who were used to SU carburettors. The R-series model was replaced in July 1984 with the short-lived S-series model, which was built until October 1984 when the EFi was launched. Despite the reliability issues, more than 15,000 MG Maestro 1600s were built.

===MG Maestro 2.0 EFi (1984–1991)===
After a brief interval, the MG Maestro was relaunched in October 1984 with a fuel-injected 2.0-litre O-series engine that gave considerably better performance than its predecessor. Handling and performance were both improved and gave Austin Rover its first serious rival for the Golf GTI and Escort XR3i. It had a claimed output of , a top speed of and a 0-60 mph time of 8.5 seconds. It was also mated with a Honda PG1 gearbox for improved gearchange, in preference to the Volkswagen box as supplied to the rest of the range.

===MG Maestro Turbo (1989–1991)===
With the Rover Group only a few months away, the limited edition (500 + 5 press cars) MG Maestro Turbo (displayed at Birmingham in October 1988 and launched in early 1989) was the final car from ARG. It made use of the 2.0&#x27;s already impressive engine, but the combination of carburetor and turbocharger gave it a top speed of and a 0–60 mph time of 6.7 seconds. It was faster than the majority of its competitors, but the high performance, Tickford designed bodykit and alloys did little to disguise the fact that it was very much still a Maestro. Sales were slow, as it appeared six years after the Maestro&#x27;s launch.

Production of the MG Maestro finished in 1991, as Rover had launched GTi versions of the new 200 and 400 models, though the standard Maestro remained in production until 1994.

==Decline and &quot;rebirth&quot;==
Production of the Maestro, which was already suffering from a decline in sales, was pruned back by autumn 1989 on the launch of the second generation Rover 200, which was aimed at the higher end of the small family car market, with the Maestro being kept on sale as a cheaper alternative with more basic versions available.

The arrival of the Rover 600 in 1993 saw the closure of the Maestro/Montego assembly line, but small-scale production in complete knock down (CKD) kit form continued until 1994, when BMW&#x27;s takeover of Rover saw production cease almost immediately.

In 1994, Rover established Rodacar, a joint venture with a Bulgarian company to produce Maestros at a new factory in Varna, using CKD kits sent from the UK. Production began in July 1995 and 2,200 cars were assembled before the factory closed in April 1996. The venture failed because of competition from other cars and the Bulgarian government&#x27;s failure to honour agreements to reduce tariffs on imported parts and buy thousands of Maestros for government departments. Around 1,700 of the Rodacar-made Maestros were exported, including 550 to Uruguay, 400 to Argentina and 200 to North Macedonia.

Two British dealers, Parkway Services in Ledbury and a company called Apple 2000 in Bury St Edmunds, acquired unsold Maestros from Bulgaria and sold them in the UK, converting most of them to right-hand drive. (Please see the &#x27;Later Developments&#x27; above for more information.)

Many interior parts from the Maestro/Montego series continued to be used in various Land Rover models well into the late 1990s, for instance the Maestro instrument pack and switchgear were fitted to the Range Rover Classic from the mid-1980s onward, as well as on the Series I Discovery from launch until the 1995 facelift. The Series I Discovery also used the tail lamp cluster from the Maestro van until 1998.

Like most pre-1989 Austin Rover cars, 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre Maestros cannot run on unleaded petrol without the cylinder head being converted (remachining of the cylinder head), or the use of fuel additives. FBHVC (Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs) tested and approved lead replacement fuel additives, work out at only a couple of pence a litre. The 1994 cc O-series engine in the MG EFi, 2.0i and Turbo has sufficiently hard exhaust valves and seats.

Muddying the water slightly, contemporary sales literature for the MG Turbo (and the owners&#x27; handbook) advised drivers to use only 4* leaded petrol. This was because unleaded petrol was only available with an octane rating of 95 RON. The turbo engine was tuned for the higher 97 RON octane rating of leaded petrol, which improves combustion and reduces the chances of &#x27;pinking&#x27; and running lean on boost: both very harmful to turbo engines. Modern high-octane unleaded petrol is a perfectly suitable substitute, but it had yet to become available on forecourts when the cars were current.

===Chinese production===


In 1997, three years after production of the Maestro ended in the UK, the Chinese tobacco company Etsong acquired the tooling and intellectual property rights to the car. In 2001, the company placed it back into production in two variants; the Etsong Lubao QE6400 Ruby and Etsong Lubao QE6440 Laird, built in a new, specially constructed factory in Qingdao, China. The QE6400 used the hatchback bodyshell of the Maestro, but the frontal styling of the Montego, while the QE6440 was a panel van variant. Both cars used Toyota engines and transmissions.

In 2003, Etsong exited the car-making business and sold the Lubao factory to First Automobile Works, one of China&#x27;s biggest car-makers. FAW continued to market the hatchback as the Jiefang CA6400UA and the van as the Jiefang CA6440UA. Production for the FAW based cars ended in 2006 then in 2008 the Maestro Van was relaunched as the Yema SQJ6450 by Sichuan Auto Industry Group Company Ltd, who had purchased the tooling from FAW. Yema Auto have since reskinned the car and is currently selling SUV-styled wagon versions as the Yema F99, F10, and most recently the F12 (2012).
===Sales===
The Maestro sold over 605,000 units, although it failed to match the success of the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra. A survey by &quot;Auto Express&quot; magazine, conducted in August 2006, revealed that the Maestro was Britain&#x27;s ninth most scrapped car of the previous 30 years, with just 11,574 examples still in circulation and in working order in the United Kingdom. By 2009, that number declined to 777 units, and only 116 were still operating in 2023.

Despite only going on sale in early March 1983, the Maestro was Britain&#x27;s sixth best selling car in 1983 with more than 65,000 sales. Its first full year on sale, 1984, brought more than 83,000 sales – which would be the Maestro&#x27;s best year for sales in any country. As had happened the previous year, it was Britain&#x27;s sixth best selling car in 1984. However, it had fallen to 10th in 1985; although Austin Rover managed to keep up a strong presence in this sector due to the arrival of the similar sized Rover 200 saloon in June 1984. By 1988, it was merely the 14th best selling car in Britain, dipping further to 19th place in 1989, the year that the second generation Rover 200 was launched. The Maestro was now not only behind the all conquering Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra (which first outsold it in 1985) in the sales charts, but also behind some foreign competitors including the Volkswagen Golf and Peugeot 309. Sales fell lower still afterwards, as the latest Rover 200 was firmly established as the Rover Group&#x27;s best seller in this sector, and the Maestro remained on sale as a cheaper alternative until the last ones left the showrooms in the mid-1990s.

==In popular culture==
The Austin and MG Maestro were an early example of product placement on UK television and after the car was launched in March 1983, it featured prominently in several TV programmes, including BBCs &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; which dedicated a part of a programme to explain how the car was developed and demonstrate the synthesized voice feature. Channel 4&#x27;s soap opera, &quot;Brookside&quot; (1982–2003), wrote an entire storyline where the characters, Paul and Annabelle Collins, &#x27;downsized&#x27; from their upmarket Rover SD1 for a more basic Austin Maestro. When they were seen looking at a brand new Maestro in a car showroom, prominent advertising surrounding the car declared it &quot;The Magic Maestro!&quot; in episodes aired in March 1983. The (then) state of the art voice command told them the car needed &quot;more fuel&quot;. They settled on buying the gold coloured basic trim and not the &quot;computerised version&quot; in the end. Their Maestro had the registration SAB 453Y. It was first registered in March 1983 and written off in June 1994.

Also in 1983, the BBC TV series, &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; (1980–1985), the main character, Inspector Kate Longton (Anna Carteret), drove a gold Austin Maestro (registration SOJ 626Y) This was seen in every episode, as well as in the opening titles, from September 1983 - curiously, according to the National Motoring Database records, the Y-registered Austin Maestro Inspector Longton drove was first registered in February 1983 - one month &quot;before&quot; the car was officially launched.

In 1985, the ITV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1964–1988 series) launched new opening titles which followed a red MG Maestro (with the registration B54 YDE; its first official DVLA registration was June 1985 - these titles first aired in March) from the A38(M) in Birmingham to Crossroads Motel in the fictional village of &quot;Kings Oak&quot;. These titles lasted until 1987.

In the BBC TV drama serial, &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; (1985-1990), the character, Tom Howard, drove an MG Maestro during the first series in 1985. Fittingly, his then wife, Jan Howard, drove an Austin Metro.

<doc id="520704" wikidata="Q141554" url="?curid=520704" title="1620 Geographos">
<text>1620 Geographos (; provisional designation ) is a highly elongated, stony asteroid, near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, with a mean diameter of approximately . It was discovered on 14 September 1951, by astronomers Albert George Wilson and Rudolph Minkowski at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was named in honor of the National Geographic Society.

== Orbit and classification ==

Geographos orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–1.7 AU once every 1 years and 5 months (508 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.34 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years. Due to its high eccentricity, Geographos is also a Mars-crosser asteroid. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Palomar, two weeks prior to its official discovery observation.

=== Close approaches ===
As a potentially hazardous asteroid, Geographos has a minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.05 AU and a diameter of greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is currently , which translates into 11.7 lunar distances. In 1994, Geographos made its closest approach to Earth in two centuries at 5.0 Gm – which will not be bettered until 2586.

== Failed &quot;Clementine&quot; mission ==
Geographos was to be explored by the U.S.&#x27;s Clementine mission which was launched in January 1994. However, a malfunction in the spacecraft ended the mission before it could approach the asteroid. 

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type ===
In the Tholen and SMASS classification, Geographos is an S-type asteroid. This means that it is highly reflective and composed of nickel-iron mixed with iron- and magnesium-silicates.

=== Rotation period ===
Since the 1970s, several rotational lightcurve of Geographos have been obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period (retrograde sense of rotation) between 5.222 and 5.224 hours with a very high brightness variation between 1.02 and 2.03 magnitude ().

The Yarkovsky effect is causing a decrease in the orbital semimajor axis of , while the YORP effect is increasing the asteroid&#x27;s rotation at the rate of .

=== Spin axis ===
Several lightcurve were also modeled from the abundant photometric observations. In 1994 and 1995, Polish astronomers obtained a concurring period 5.223328 hours and found a spin axis of (54.0°, −52.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β) (). Radiometric observations gave a period of 5.223327 hours and a pole of (55.0°, −46.0°). Two other international studies obtained a period of 5.223326 hours and a pole at (56.0°, −47.0°) and (55.0°, −45.0°), respectively ().

=== Shape and structure ===
The light curve shows a high amplitude, indicative of its elongated shape, measuring 5.0×2.0×2.1 kilometers, which corresponds to a mean-diameter of 2.5 km.

The interior of the asteroid probably has a rubble-pile structure. The asteroid&#x27;s high thermal inertia indicates the surface is most likely a mix of fine grains and large rocks and boulders. During the asteroid&#x27;s close approach to Earth in 1994, a radar study of it was conducted by the Deep Space Network at the Goldstone Observatory, California. The resultant images show Geographos to be the most elongated object in the Solar System.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the observations with the Goldstone Observatory and the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and the NEOWISE mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Geographos measures between 1.77 and 2.56 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.26 and 0.3258. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts an albedo of 0.26 and a diameter of 2.5 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.09.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named after the National Geographic Society, in recognition of its contribution to astronomy by supporting the National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (NGS-POSS), which produced a photographic atlas of the entire northern sky in the 1950s. NGS-POSS was headed by the second discoverer, Rudolph Minkowski. The Greek word means geographer (from &quot;geo–&quot; &#x27;Earth&#x27; + &#x27;drawer/writer&#x27;). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in August 1956 ().

<text>David Llewellyn Harding (12 October 1867 – 26 December 1952), known professionally as Lyn Harding, was a Welsh actor who spent 40 years on the stage before entering British made silent films, talkies and radio. He had an imposing and menacing stage presence and came to be cast as the villain in many films, notably Professor Moriarty in dramatisations of the Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Early years==
He was born in 1867 at St. Brides Wentloog, in Monmouthshire, into a strict Congregationalist Welsh-speaking family.

==Acting career==
He started his career as an apprentice draper in Newport, Wales and but he was drawn to an acting career. He began giving readings from Shakespeare at a chapel in Cardiff. In 1890 a chance meeting with a touring group on a train led to him standing in for a sick actor and his first professional engagement. He opened on 28 August 1890 in &quot;The Grip Of Iron&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bristol.
He toured &quot;the provinces&quot; and eventually made his London debut at the Shakespeare Theatre, Clapham on 19 July 1897.

He later changed his name to &quot;Lyn&quot; to make it more acceptable to English audiences who found &quot;Llewellyn&quot; difficult to pronounce.
In 1910, he portrayed Dr Grimesby Rylott in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s play &quot;The Speckled Band&quot;.

His career spanned stage, silent screen, talkies and radio productions and he toured in the United States, Japan, India and Burma. He worked at different times with John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Anthony Quayle.

His last stage appearance was as Abu Hassan in &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; in the West End in 1941 when he was 74 years old. At the age of nearly 80 he played Owain Glyndŵr in Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry IV for BBC radio.

He lived for about ten years in Leverstock Green, near Hemel Hempstead where he played an active role in the local community, even staging plays and revues with fellow actors to help raise funds for a much needed parish hall. He died in London in 1952, aged 85.

<text>Sir Hugh John Macdonald, (March 13, 1850 – March 29, 1929) was the only surviving son of the first prime minister of Canada, John A. Macdonald. He too was a politician, serving as a member of the House of Commons of Canada and a federal cabinet minister, and briefly as the eighth premier of Manitoba.

==Early life==
Macdonald was born in Kingston, Canada West (now Ontario) to Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald and his first wife Isabella Clark Macdonald (1809–1857). After Isabella died leaving Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son, Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband. In 1869, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and then studied law in Toronto and Ottawa. He was called to the Bar in 1872, and became a member of his father&#x27;s firm. Grieved by the death of his first wife, Macdonald moved to Winnipeg in 1882 and set up his own law practice.

==Military service==
Macdonald served with the 14th Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles during the summer of 1866 near Cornwall, in anticipation of a Fenian invasion. While at the University of Toronto, he enrolled in The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada on 13 October 1868 as a Rifleman and rose to the rank of Sergeant before being commissioned as an Ensign on 22 April 1870.

Macdonald then joined the expedition of Colonel Garnet Joseph Wolseley as an Ensign in the 16th Company of the 1st (Ontario) Battalion of Rifles and made the trek to the Red River settlement in Manitoba. The Wolseley Expedition was formed to put down Louis Riel&#x27;s Red River Rebellion. After taking part in the bloodless capture of Upper Fort Garry (after Riel&#x27;s departure) he returned to Toronto, but would take part in putting down Riel&#x27;s second rebellion.

He retired from the QOR on 26 April 1882 and moved to Winnipeg. During the North-West rebellion in 1885, Macdonald served as a lieutenant in the 90th (Winnipeg) Battalion of Rifles, a unit which he helped to organize. He later fought at Fish Creek in Saskatchewan.

==Marriage==
In 1876, Hugh John Macdonald married Jean Murray King, a Roman Catholic. Their daughter, Isabella Mary &quot;Daisy&quot; Macdonald, was born in 1877. Jean King Macdonald later died in 1881 as a result of fragile health due to Daisy&#x27;s birth.

In 1883, he married Gertrude Agnes VanKoughnet. She was the daughter of a close friend and political ally of his father, Salter Jehosaphat VanKoughnet (1833–1888) QC, of Toronto, a brother of Philip Michael Matthew Scott VanKoughnet. Gertrude&#x27;s mother, Agnes, was a daughter of Senator Benjamin Seymour, of Port Hope, Ontario, and the sister of Emily Seymour who was married to Lt. Colonel Arthur Trefusis Heneage Williams. They had a son, John Alexander &quot;Jack&quot; Macdonald (1884–1905) and Daisy Macdonald (1877–1959). The Macdonalds are buried at St John&#x27;s Cathedral Cemetery.

==Politics==

Macdonald was elected to the House of Commons in the 1891 federal election, representing Winnipeg City for the Conservative Party. He was sworn into parliament at the side of his father, to the applause of members from both sides. After the older Macdonald died later in the year, however, Hugh John showed little enthusiasm for life in Ottawa. Despite efforts by John Abbott and John S.D. Thompson to keep him in federal politics, he resigned his seat in 1893 and returned to Winnipeg.

In 1896, Prime Minister Charles Tupper convinced him to return to Ottawa and serve as Minister of the Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs. This occurred at a time when the Conservative Party was suffering from internal divisions, and was due to face the public in a general election. Tupper probably hoped that the Macdonald name would win back some wayward voters.

The 1896 election was won by Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals, and while Macdonald was again elected for Winnipeg City (narrowly defeating former provincial minister Joseph Martin), his election was declared void in early 1897. He once again returned to Winnipeg, and did not contest the subsequent by-election.

In March 1897, Macdonald was approached to take the leadership of Manitoba&#x27;s Conservative Party. The party had suffered severe losses to Thomas Greenway&#x27;s Liberals in the elections of 1888, 1892 and 1896, and had lacked direction since the death of former Premier John Norquay in 1889. By 1897, however, there was a recognition that the provincial situation was susceptible to change. Greenway&#x27;s second and third majorities were based almost entirely on popular support for his education reforms; with the education issue resolved in 1896, the Conservatives had a viable chance to form government. Macdonald accepted the leadership position, and (though without seat in the legislature) spent the next two years touring the province in anticipation of the next election.

==Premiership==

The Conservative Party of Manitoba became a legally recognized entity in 1899, and drew up its first election platform shortly thereafter. This was a progressive document by the standards of its age, calling for an independent board of education, new agricultural and technical colleges, a Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act, prohibition, and the nationalization of railways. On a less progressive note, the party also tapped into popular resentment toward new Eastern European immigrants. Both of these factors contributed to an upset victory in the 1899 provincial election, with Conservatives taking 22 seats out of 40. Macdonald narrowly defeated incumbent Liberal John D. Cameron in Winnipeg South, and was sworn in as Premier on January 10, 1900. He also took the position of Municipal Commissioner.

His term in office was brief. Macdonald succeeded in passing a prohibition bill (known as the &quot;Macdonald Act&quot;), but was again prevailed upon to run for the federal Conservatives in the 1900 federal election. It is possible that he intended to replace Charles Tupper as national party leader.

Macdonald resigned as Premier on October 29, 1900, and challenged Minister of the Interior Clifford Sifton in the riding of Brandon. Sifton was the most powerful cabinet minister in western Canada, but the Conservatives believed that Hugh John&#x27;s personal popularity would be enough to defeat him. They were mistaken. Despite a spirited challenge, Sifton won the election with 5,011 votes to Macdonald&#x27;s 4,342.

Macdonald abandoned electoral politics after this loss, and returned to his law practice. He continued to be involved in the Conservative Party organization within Manitoba, serving as President of the Manitoba Conservative Association from 1905 to 1908. He was appointed Police Magistrate for Winnipeg in 1911, and was made a Knight Bachelor in June 1913. There were rumours that he would return to lead the Conservative Party in 1915, but this did not come to pass.

Macdonald was Winnipeg&#x27;s Magistrate during the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919. Immigrants arrested during the strike appeared before him and he ordered them sent to an internment camp at Kapuskasing from where they were eventually deported without the right to formal hearings.

Macdonald&#x27;s last home in downtown Winnipeg, called Dalnavert, is now a museum. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1990.

<doc id="520711" wikidata="Q1072340" url="?curid=520711" title="List of current monarchs of sovereign states">
<text>A monarch is the head of a monarchy, a form of government in which a state is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.

A variety of titles are applied in English; for example, &quot;king&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;, &quot;prince&quot; and &quot;princess&quot;, &quot;grand duke&quot; and &quot;grand duchess&quot;, &quot;emperor&quot; and &quot;empress&quot;. Although they will be addressed differently in their local languages, the names and titles in the list below have been styled using the common English equivalent. Roman numerals, used to distinguish related rulers with the same name, have been applied where typical.

In political and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both historical and contemporary contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined using a variety of distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.

Entries below are listed beside their respective dominions, which are organised alphabetically. These monarchs reign as head of state in their respective sovereign states. Monarchs reigning over a constituent division, cultural or traditional polity are listed under constituent monarchs. For a list of former ruling families or abolished thrones, see: former ruling families.

<doc id="520718" wikidata="Q3359425" url="?curid=520718" title="Queenscliff, Victoria">
<text>Queenscliff is a town at the south-eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula in southern Victoria, Australia. It lies south of Swan Bay at the entrance to Port Phillip. It is the administrative centre for the Borough of Queenscliffe. At the , Queenscliff had a population of 3,276.

Queenscliff is a seaside resort known for its Victorian era heritage and tourist industry and as one of the endpoints of the Searoad ferry to Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, it was inhabited by the Bengalat Bulag clan of the Wautharong tribe, members of the Kulin nation.

European explorers first arrived in 1802, Lieutenant John Murray in January and Captain Matthew Flinders in April. The first European settler in the area was convict escapee William Buckley between 1803 and 1835, who briefly lived in a cave with local Aborigines at Point Lonsdale, above which the lighthouse was later built.

Permanent European settlement began in 1836 when squatters arrived. Shortland&#x27;s Bluff was named in honour of Lieutenant John Shortland, who assisted in the surveying of Port Phillip. Land sales began in 1853, the same year the name was changed to Queenscliff by Lieutenant Charles La Trobe, in honour of Queen Victoria.

The Post Office opened on 1 May 1853 as Shortland&#x27;s Bluff and was renamed Queenscliff in 1854.

Originally a fishing village, Queenscliff soon became an important cargo port, servicing steamships trading in Port Philip. A shipping pilot service was established in 1841 to lead boats through the treacherous Rip, and its two lighthouses, the High and Low Lights, were constructed in 1862–63. Queenscliff also played an important military role. Fort Queenscliff was built between 1879 and 1889, and operated as the command centre for a network of forts around the port.

===1880s seaside resort boom===

Queenscliff became a tourist destination in the late 19th century, visitors arriving from Melbourne after a two-hour journey on the paddle steamer, &quot;Ozone&quot;.

The opening of a railway line to Geelong in 1879 brought more tourists to the area, and numerous luxury hotels (or coffee palaces) were built to accommodate them. The Palace Hotel (later renamed Esplanade Hotel, now known as the Queenscliff Brewhouse) was built in 1879, the Baillieu Hotel was built in 1881 (and later renamed Ozone Hotel), the Vue Grande Hotel in 1883, and the Queenscliff Hotel in 1887.

===Decline===
The advent of the car saw Queenscliff drop in popularity as a tourist destination, as tourists were no longer dependent on its role as a transport hub. The railway ceased weekly passenger services in 1950, and was closed in 1976. In 1979 the Queenscliff Railway reopened as a Heritage Train Service, running between Queenscliff and Drysdale stations with mid-point stops at Laker&#x27;s Siding and Suma Park.

===Revival===
The 1980s saw a return in the town&#x27;s tourist popularity.

In 2005, the area previously holding the Fort Barracks was subdivided into residential blocks and renamed Shortlands Beach in honour of the town&#x27;s prior name. The proposed redevelopment drew fierce criticism from some sectors of the community, who feared loss of an important heritage site. The original fort remains on site.

===Heritage listed sites===

Queenscliff contains several Victorian Heritage Register listed sites, including:

* 1 Weeroona Parade and 2 Wharf Street, Fisherman&#x27;s Shed
* 44 Gellibrand Street, Lathamstowe
* 42 Gellibrand Street, Ozone Hotel
* 60-62 Gellibrand Street, Pilots Cottages
* 16 Gellibrand Street, Queenscliff Hotel
* Symonds Street, Queenscliff Pier and Lifeboat Complex
* 20 Symonds Street, Queenscliff railway station
* 26 King Street, Rosenfeld
* 42 Mercer Street, Roseville Cottage
* 16-26 Hobson Street, St George the Martyr Church and Parish Hall
* 80 Mercer Street, Warringah
* Corner Wharf Street and Gellibrand Street, Wreck Bell
* 133-135 Hesse St, Shortlands Bluff

==Arts and culture==

===Festivals===
The Queenscliff Seafood Feast, a culinary festival using fresh seafood donated by local fishermen, is held annually on Good Friday to raise funds for the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Queenscliff is also home to the Queenscliff Music Festival, a popular annual music festival, held on the last weekend of November, which attracts both local and international acts and is an important part of the town&#x27;s tourist industry.

===Museums===
Queenscliff has three museums; the Queenscliff Historical Museum, Queenscliff Maritime Museum, and the Fort Queenscliff Museum.

===Sport===
The Queenscliff Football Club is the town&#x27;s Australian rules football club which participates in the Bellarine Football League.

Golfers play at the Queenscliff Golf Club at Swan Island.

===Media===
The &quot;Queenscliff Herald&quot; was founded in 1999 by Greg Wane, who edited and managed the newspaper until 2004, when the Murphy family bought the masthead and continue to publish the newspaper.

The final elimination on the second season of &quot;The Mole&quot; took place here in late 2000.

=== Tourist attractions ===
As a popular tourist destination, Queenscliff has numerous tourist attractions including the Bellarine Railway, the Marine and Freshwater Discovery Centre and Queenscliff Harbour.

==Transport==
As it is located on a peninsula, the Bellarine Highway is the only road connecting it to Point Lonsdale and Geelong running west.

Searoad Ferries provides transport from Queenscliff to Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula.

It was once connected by railway to Geelong; however, the Bellarine Railway now runs as a tourist railway only to Drysdale. The Bellarine Rail Trail is a 32 km walking and cycling track that follows the route of the former rail line.

<text>The Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (also (Zhukovsky) Central Institute of Aerodynamics, , TsAGI) is a Russian national research centre for aviation. It was founded in Moscow by Russian aviation pioneer Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky on December 1, 1918.

==History==
From 1925 and up to the 1930s, TsAGI developed and hosted Tupolev&#x27;s AGOS (&quot;Aviatziya, Gidroaviatziya i Opytnoye Stroitelstvo&quot;, the &quot;Aviation, Hydroaviation, and Experimental Construction&quot;), the first aircraft design bureau in Soviet Union, and at the time the main one. In 1930, two other major aircraft design bureaus in the country were the Ilyushin&#x27;s TsKB (&quot;Tsentralnoye Konstruksionnoye Byuro&quot; means &quot;Central Design Bureau&quot;) and an independent, short-lived Kalinin&#x27;s team in Kharkiv.

In 1935 TsAGI was partly relocated to the former dacha settlement &quot;Otdykh&quot; (literally, &quot;Relaxation&quot;) converted to the new urban-type settlement &quot;Stakhanovo&quot;. It was named after Alexey Stakhanov, a famous Soviet miner. On April 23, 1947, the settlement was granted town status and renamed to Zhukovsky. The Moscow branch of the institute is known Moscow complex of TsAGI. In 1965 in Zhukovsky a Department of Aeromechanics and Flight Engineering of MIPT was established with support of TsAGI&#x27;s research and knowledge base to educate specialists for aerospace industry.

Among TsAGI&#x27;s developments are the participation in the rocket Energia and the Space Shuttle Buran projects.

<doc id="520727" wikidata="Q993725" url="?curid=520727" title="Bruno Rossi">
<text>Bruno Benedetto Rossi ( , ; 13 April 1905 – 21 November 1993) was an Italian-American experimental physicist. He made major contributions to particle physics and the study of cosmic rays. A 1927 graduate of the University of Bologna, he became interested in cosmic rays. To study them, he invented an improved electronic coincidence circuit, and travelled to Eritrea to conduct experiments that showed that cosmic ray intensity from the West was significantly larger than that from the East.

Forced to emigrate in October 1938 due to the Italian racial laws, Rossi moved to Denmark, where he worked with Niels Bohr. He then moved to Britain, where he worked with Patrick Blackett at the University of Manchester. Finally he went to the United States, where he worked with Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, and later at Cornell University. Rossi stayed in the United States, and became an American citizen.

During World War II, Rossi worked on radar at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, and he played a pivotal role in the Manhattan Project, heading the group at the Los Alamos Laboratory that carried out the RaLa Experiments. After the war, he was recruited by Jerrold Zacharias at MIT, where Rossi continued his pre-war research into cosmic rays.

In the 1960s, he pioneered X-ray astronomy and space plasma physics. His instrumentation on Explorer 10 detected the magnetopause, and he initiated the rocket experiments that discovered Scorpius X-1, the first extra-solar source of X-rays.

== Italy ==
Rossi was born to a Jewish family in Venice, Italy. He was the eldest of three sons of Rino Rossi and Lina Minerbi. His father was an electrical engineer, who participated in the electrification of Venice. Rossi was tutored at home until the age of fourteen, after which he attended the Ginnasio and the Liceo in Venice. After beginning his university studies at the University of Padua, he undertook advanced work at the University of Bologna, where he received a Laurea in Physics in 1927. His thesis advisor was Quirino Majorana, who was a well-known experimentalist and an uncle of the physicist Ettore Majorana.

=== Florence ===
In 1928, Rossi began his career at the University of Florence, as assistant to Antonio Garbasso, who had founded the University&#x27;s Physics Institute in 1920. It was located in Arcetri, on a hill overlooking the city. When Rossi arrived, Garbasso was Podestà of Florence, appointed by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government of Italy. However, he brought to the Institute a group of brilliant physicists which included Enrico Fermi and Franco Rasetti before they moved to Rome, as well as , Enrico Persico, and Giulio Racah. In 1929, Rossi&#x27;s first graduate student, Giuseppe Occhialini, was awarded the doctoral degree.

In search of pioneering research, Rossi turned his attention to cosmic rays, which had been discovered by Victor Hess in manned balloon flights in 1911 and 1912. In 1929, Rossi read the paper of Walther Bothe and Werner Kolhörster, which described their discovery of charged cosmic ray particles that penetrated of gold. This was astonishing, for the most penetrating charged particles known at the time were electrons from radioactive decay, which could penetrate less than a millimetre of gold. In Rossi&#x27;s words, it

=== Rossi coincidence circuit ===
In 1954, Bothe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the coincidence method and his discoveries made therewith&quot; for a method of assessing coincident events he implemented prior to 1924. However, his implementation of this method was very cumbersome, for it involved visual correlation of photographed pulses. Within a few weeks of reading his paper with Kolhörster, Rossi invented an improved electronic coincidence circuit, which made use of triode vacuum tubes. The Rossi coincidence circuit has two major advantages: it offers very precise temporal resolution and it can detect coincidences among any number of pulse sources. These features make it possible to identify interesting events that produce coincident pulses in several counters. These rare events stand out even in the presence of high rates of unrelated background pulses in the individual counters. The circuit not only provided the basis for electronic instrumentation in nuclear and particle physics, but also implemented the first electronic AND circuit, which is a fundamental element of the digital logic that is ubiquitous in modern electronics.

At the time, an improved tubular version of the original Geiger counter, invented by Hans Geiger in 1908, had just been developed by his student Walther Müller. These Geiger–Müller tubes (GM tubes or counters) made possible Bothe&#x27;s investigations. With Occhialini&#x27;s help in the construction of GM tubes, and with the aid of a practical coincidence circuit, Rossi confirmed and extended the results of Bothe, who invited him to visit Berlin in the summer of 1930. Here, with financial support arranged by Garbasso, Rossi collaborated on further investigations of cosmic ray penetration. He also studied Carl Størmer&#x27;s mathematical description of the trajectories of charged particles in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. On the basis of these studies, he realised that the intensity of cosmic rays coming from eastward directions might be different from that of westward ones. From Berlin, he submitted the first paper suggesting that observations of this east–west effect could not only confirm that cosmic rays are charged particles, but also determine the sign of their charge.

=== Rome conference ===
In the fall of 1931, Fermi and Orso Mario Corbino organized in Rome an international conference on nuclear physics, which was sponsored by the Royal Academy of Italy. Fermi invited Rossi to give an introductory talk on cosmic rays. In the audience were Robert Millikan and Arthur Compton, both of whom had won the Nobel prize in physics, in 1923 and 1927, respectively. During the 1920s, Millikan, who is famous for his oil drop experiment, made extensive measurements of the mysterious radiation discovered by Hess. He coined the name &quot;cosmic rays&quot; and proposed that they were photons created by the fusion of hydrogen in interstellar space. He was not pleased by the presentation of evidence that most observed cosmic rays are energetic charged particles. Later, Rossi wrote:
Compton, who is famous for the Compton effect, had a more positive reaction, for he told Rossi later that the talk had motivated him to begin his own research on cosmic rays.

=== Rossi curve ===
Immediately after the Rome conference, Rossi carried out two experiments that led to a significant advance in the understanding of cosmic rays. Both involved triple coincidences of pulses from three Geiger counters; but in the first, the counters were aligned and separated by blocks of lead, while in the second, they were placed in a triangular configuration such that all three could not be traversed by a single particle travelling in a straight line. Results from the first configuration demonstrated the existence of cosmic-ray particles capable of penetrating of lead.

With the second configuration enclosed in a lead box, the results showed that some cosmic rays interact in lead to produce multiple secondary particles. In an extension of the second experiment, he measured the rate of triple coincidences as a function of the amount of the lead above the counters. A plot of this rate against thickness, which came to be known as the Rossi curve, showed a rapid rise as the lead layer was increased, followed by a slow decline. These experiments showed that ground-level cosmic rays consist of two components: a &quot;soft&quot; component which is capable of prolific generation of multiple particle events, and a &quot;hard&quot; component which is capable of traversing great thicknesses of lead. At the time, the physical nature of both was a mystery, for they did not yet fit into the growing body of knowledge about nuclear and particle physics.

Late in 1931, Rossi arranged for Occhialini to work in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge with Patrick Blackett, whom he had met in Berlin. With the aid of the new technique of electronic coincidence, Occhialini helped Blackett develop the first counter-controlled cloud chamber, with which they confirmed Carl Anderson&#x27;s discovery of the positron and deduced that the positive electrons are produced in association with negative ones by pair production. Up to 23 positive and negative electrons were observed in some events, which were clearly related to the showers of Rossi&#x27;s soft component.

=== Padua ===

In 1932, Rossi won a competition for an academic position in an Italian university, and was appointed professor of experimental physics at the University of Padua. Soon after Rossi arrived, the rector asked him to oversee the design and construction of Padua&#x27;s new Physics Institute. Although this task diverted his attention from research and teaching, he complied willingly, and the institute opened in 1937.

=== East-West effect ===
In spite of this distraction, Rossi was able to complete, in 1933, an experiment on the east–west effect that he had begun before leaving Arcetri. Because this effect is more prominent near the equator, he organised an expedition to Asmara in Eritrea, which was then an Italian colony on the Red Sea at a latitude of 15° N. With Sergio De Benedetti, he set up a &quot;cosmic ray telescope&quot;, which consisted of two separated GM counters in coincidence, whose axis of maximum sensitivity could be pointed in any direction. It soon became apparent that cosmic ray intensity from the West was significantly larger than that from the East. This meant that there was a larger influx of positive primary particles than of negative ones. At the time, this result was surprising, because most investigators held the preconceived notion that the primaries would be negative electrons.

Just as Rossi left Eritrea, he received news of two observations of a similar east–west effect. These were published in the &quot;Physical Review&quot;. One was by Thomas H. Johnson, and the other was by Compton and his student, Luis Alvarez, who reported observations at Mexico City, where the latitude is 19° N. Because others had carried out the first experimental exploitation of his important idea of 1930, Rossi was disappointed, but published his results immediately after returning to Padua. Later, with Frederick C. Chromey, Alvarez and Rossi patented a &quot;Vertical Determination Device&quot;, which made use of cosmic ray telescopes.

In Eritrea, Rossi discovered another phenomenon that would become a principal theme of his postwar cosmic ray research: extensive cosmic ray air showers. The discovery occurred during tests to determine the rate of accidental coincidences between the Geiger counters of his detector. To assure that no single particle could trigger the counters he spread them out in a horizontal plane. In this configuration, the frequency of coincidences was greater than that calculated on the basis of the individual rates and the resolving time of the coincidence circuit. Rossi concluded that:

In 1937, Rossi became acquainted with Nora Lombroso, the daughter of Ugo Lombroso, a professor of physiology at the University of Palermo, and Silvia Forti. Her grandfather was the renowned physician and criminologist Cesare Lombroso, and her aunts, Gina Lombroso and Paola Lombroso Carrara, were well known Italian writers and educators. In April 1938, Bruno and Nora married and set up a household in Padua.

Although Rossi avoided politics, some of Rossi&#x27;s associates were active opponents of the fascist state. For example, he mentored Eugenio Curiel, who became a member of the communist party, while completing a degree at Padua. Later, in 1943, Curiel joined the resistance in Milan, and in 1945, was assassinated by soldiers of the Republic of Salò a German puppet state. Similarly, Ettore Pancini, who received his &quot;laurea&quot; under Rossi in 1938, spent the war years alternating between cosmic ray research and active participation in the Italian resistance movements of Padua and Venice.

Because of these associations, and because both Rossis were Jewish, they became apprehensive as Italy&#x27;s antisemitism grew under the influence of Nazi Germany. Eventually, as a result of anti-Jewish laws resulting from the Manifesto of Race, Rossi was dismissed from his professorship. In his words:
== Exile ==
With this setback, Rossi began an important phase of his career. He summarised this period in a memoir: &quot;The Decay of &#x27;Mesotrons&#x27; (1939–1943): Experimental Particle Physics in the Age of Innocence&quot;, which he presented in a symposium at Fermilab in 1980. On 12 October 1938, the Rossis left for Copenhagen, where the Danish physicist, Niels Bohr, had invited him to study. The couple had no intention of returning to Italy, and Bohr facilitated Rossi&#x27;s search for a more secure position by sponsoring a conference attended by leading physicists. He hoped that one of them would find Rossi a job, and soon, Rossi received an invitation to come to the University of Manchester, where Blackett was developing a major center of cosmic ray research. After a pleasant two months in Denmark, Rossi and Nora arrived in Manchester.

=== Manchester ===
Rossi&#x27;s stay in Manchester was brief, but productive. At this time, a clear understanding of the soft component was available. In 1934, Hans Bethe and Walter Heitler published a quantitative description not only of the production of electron-positron pairs by energetic photons, but also of the production of photons by energetic electrons and positrons. At Manchester, Rossi collaborated with Ludwig Jánossy on an experiment which demonstrated the correctness of the Bethe-Heitler theory of the second process, which had not yet been fully confirmed. This experiment also introduced the technique of anti-coincidence, which has become a ubiquitous feature of instruments for detecting and analyzing energetic particles.

By this time, cloud chamber observations had clarified the nature of the hard component. In 1936, Anderson and his student, Seth Neddermeyer, discovered cosmic ray particles with mass intermediate between those of the electron and the proton, which Anderson called &quot;mesotrons&quot;. The mesotron subsequently became the known as the &quot;μ meson&quot;, which was shortened to &quot;muon&quot;. Just before the Copenhagen conference, Blackett suggested that observed variations of cosmic ray intensity with atmospheric temperature could be an indication that mesotrons are unstable, and he held intense discussions with Rossi on this subject. As a result, Rossi left Manchester determined to confirm their decay and to measure the lifetime.

=== Chicago ===
With war looming over Europe, Blackett and others advised Rossi to leave Britain. Consequently, he wrote to Compton, who invited him to attend a summer symposium in Chicago, and hinted that a job might become available. In June 1939, the Rossis sailed for New York, where they were greeted by Fermi and his wife Laura, who had also left Italy because of the racial laws. After a brief reunion with the Fermis, the Rossis were offered a ride to Chicago by Bethe. They gratefully accepted, and arrived at the University of Chicago in mid-June 1939.

=== Mesotron decay ===

Immediately after a symposium session on mesotron instability reached a consensus that more definitive observations were needed, Rossi and Compton began to plan an experiment. Because the intensity of the hard component increases with altitude, while the density of air decreases, Compton suggested that the investigations should be carried out on Mount Blue Sky in Colorado, where he had worked in the early 1930s, and where access to a research site at elevation is provided by the Mount Blue Sky Scenic Byway, the highest paved road in North America. He urged Rossi to begin a series of experiments that summer, before snow blocked the road, and to help, enlisted two of his friends, Norman Hillberry and J. Barton Hoag, and a student, Winston Bostick. Rossi and his helpers hurriedly assembled equipment and loaded it onto a dilapidated bus that Compton borrowed from the zoology department.

By this time, it was known that the main process by which mesotrons lose energy is ionisation energy loss, which is described by the Bethe formula, and is proportional to the mass per unit area of the layer of material traversed. If this were the only process, the intensity of the hard component passing through a layer of solid material would decrease by the same amount as in an equivalent layer of air. Rossi and his collaborators found that the decrease was significantly larger in the atmosphere than in a corresponding layer of solid carbon. Because the distance traversed in air was much larger than that in carbon, they interpreted this result as evidence for decay of the mesotron, and taking into account the effect of relativistic time dilation, estimated its mean life at rest as roughly 2 microseconds.

The next summer, Rossi returned to Mount Evans where he performed experiments near Echo Lake at an elevation . With the use of anti coincidence techniques, the apparatus made it possible to measure the mean free path before decay of two groups of mesotrons with different average momentum. The results, published with David B. Hall, not only confirmed the proportionality between particle momentum and the mean free path of mesotrons before decay that is expected on the basis of relativity theory, but also presented an improved estimate of the lifetime at rest: (2.4±0.3) microseconds. These results and those of the previous year were not only the first to show definitively that mesotrons are unstable, but also the first experimental confirmation of the time dilation of moving clocks predicted by relativity theory.

=== Cornell ===
At Chicago, Rossi&#x27;s position as research associate was not permanent, and Compton was unable to secure him a better one. Consequently, he began a job search, during which he gave a seminar at Cornell University, where coincidentally, death had created a vacancy in the physics department. After Bethe suggested that Rossi should be invited to fill this position, he was appointed associate professor at Cornell. In the fall of 1940, after returning to Chicago from Colorado, the Rossis left for Ithaca.

At Cornell, Rossi met his first American graduate student, Kenneth Greisen, with whom he wrote an article, &quot;Cosmic-Ray Theory&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot; and became known among cosmic-ray researchers as &quot;The Bible&quot;. During the summer of 1941, Greisen and physicists from Denver and Boulder accompanied Rossi to Mount Evans, where they refined the knowledge of proportionality between mesotron momentum and lifetime before decay. Greisen and Rossi also carried out experiments, which showed, in terms of processes documented in the &quot;Bible&quot;, that not all particles of the soft component, could be produced by mesotrons of the hard component. They interpreted this as evidence for primary electrons or photons, but it became evident later that the soft excess arises from the decay of neutral pions.

After the 1941 expedition to Colorado, Rossi decided that the question of whether mesotrons decay had been answered. However, he was not satisfied with the precision with which the lifetime had been determined, for existing estimates depended on mesotron mass, which was not accurately known. To perform a more direct measurement, he designed apparatus to measure the time interval between the arrival of a mesotron in an absorber, where it stopped, and the emission of an electron when the mesotron decayed. To assist, he obtained the help of graduate student Norris Nereson. At the heart of their experiment, was a &quot;chronometer&quot;, which was an electronic circuit that produced a pulse whose height was accurately proportional to the time interval, and which could be recorded by photographing an oscilloscope trace.

This was the first time-to-amplitude converter, another of Rossi&#x27;s contributions to electronic techniques of experimental physics. With absorbers of lead and brass, the number of decays was plotted against time. These decay curves had the same exponential form as those of ordinary radioactive substances, and gave a mean lifetime of 2.3±0.2 microseconds, which was later refined to 2.15±0.07 microseconds. After the war, Rossi discovered that his Italian colleagues, Marcello Conversi and Oreste Piccioni, had performed experiments very similar to his and measured a lifetime consistent with his result.

Looking back on what he called the &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;, Rossi wrote:

== Los Alamos ==

With the completion of his work on mesotrons, Rossi turned his attention toward the war effort. In 1942, while commuting from Ithaca to Cambridge, Massachusetts, he became a consultant on radar development at the Radiation Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Here, along with Greisen, he invented a &quot;range tracking circuit&quot;, which was patented after the war.

In early July 1943, Bethe invited Rossi to join the Manhattan Project. Within a month, he reported for duty at Los Alamos Laboratory. A few weeks later, Nora and their three-year-old daughter, Florence, joined Rossi in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The laboratory&#x27;s director, Robert Oppenheimer, asked Rossi to form a group to develop diagnostic instruments needed to create the atomic bomb. He soon realized that there already existed a group with a similar mission headed by the Swiss physicist Hans H. Staub. The two decided to merge their efforts into a single &quot;Detector Group&quot;. They were assisted by approximately twenty young researchers, including Matthew Sands an &quot;electronic wizard&quot;, who later earned a PhD under Rossi, and David B. Nicodemus, whom Staub brought from Stanford University, who was an expert on particle detectors.

=== Fast ionization chamber ===
Bomb development called for large detectors of ionising radiation, whose response is proportional to the energy released in the detector and follows rapid changes in radiation intensity. From the earliest research on radioactivity, radiation had been measured in terms of Ionisation, but existing Ionisation chambers were slow to respond to changes. To address this problem, Rossi and Staub carried out a careful analysis of the pulses that result when individual charged particles create ions within an ionisation chamber. They realised that the high mobility of free electrons removed from ionised atoms means that the pulses produced by single particles can be very brief. With James S. Allen, Rossi found gas mixtures of high electron mobility and low electron attachment. On the basis of these investigations, Allen and Rossi invented the &quot;fast ionisation chamber&quot;, which they patented after the war. It was a crucial factor in the success of the Manhattan Project and became widely used in postwar research on particle physics.

=== RaLa experiments ===

In April 1944, the Manhattan project experienced a crisis, when Emilio Segrè&#x27;s group discovered that plutonium made in reactors would not work in a gun-type plutonium weapon like the &quot;Thin Man&quot;. In response, Oppenheimer completely reorganised the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type weapon.

Rossi was enlisted to implement a method to test various weapon designs to arrive at one that produced an accurately symmetrical spherical implosion. The tests measured changes of the absorption of gamma rays in a metal sphere as it underwent implosive compression. The gamma rays were emitted by a pellet of the short-lived radioisotope Lanthanum-140 positioned in the center of the sphere. The term RaLa experiment is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. As compression progressed, the rapid increase in absorption was detected as a decrease of gamma ray intensity recorded outside of the assembly.

The RaLa experiments revealed many pitfalls on the way to a successful implosion. To understand problematic jets that plagued early implosion designs, other test methods were necessary, but the RaLa experiments played a primary role in the design of explosive lenses. In his history of the Los Alamos project, David Hawkins wrote: &quot;RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design&quot;.

=== Trinity diagnostics ===
On 16 July 1945, an implosion-type plutonium device was detonated at the Trinity site near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The code name for this device was &quot;The gadget&quot;, and its design was very similar to the Fat Man weapon that was dropped on Nagasaki twenty four days later.

In preparation for Trinity, Rossi designed instrumentation to record gamma radiation during the chain reaction, whose duration was expected to be approximately 10 nanoseconds. Observations on this time scale were almost beyond the state of the art in 1945, but Rossi designed and built a large cylindrical ionisation chamber whose speed of response was adequate because its coaxial electrodes were separated by a narrow gap of only .

To record the signal, he installed a very fast oscilloscope, provided as a prototype by DuMont Laboratories, in an underground bunker several hundred feet from the Gadget, where it was photographed. To bring the signal to the oscilloscope, he devised an oversized coaxial transmission line, whose inner conductor was made smaller as it went from chamber to oscilloscope. Because this configuration enhanced the signal reaching the oscilloscope, there was no need for amplification. To confirm this surprising behaviour, Rossi consulted with Harvard professor Edward Purcell.

A few days after the test, Rossi went into the darkroom with Fermi, and before the newly developed film was dry, they were able to compute the initial growth rate of nuclear activity, which was crucial information for future weapons development. Of three attempts to measure this rate at Trinity, Rossi&#x27;s was the only one that was fully successful.

== MIT ==
With the success of the Manhattan Project and the Radiation Laboratory, MIT moved into a new era of &quot;big science&quot; funded by the US government. MIT&#x27;s expansion in nuclear physics was spearheaded by Jerrold R. Zacharias, who went to Los Alamos late in the war, and recruited Viki Weisskopf and Rossi as MIT professors. Rossi left Los Alamos for Cambridge on 6 February 1946.

Within the new Laboratory for Nuclear Science, headed by Zacharias, Rossi was delegated to create a cosmic ray research group at MIT. To help, he recruited four young scientists who had been at Los Alamos as PhD candidates: Herbert Bridge, Matthew Sands, Robert Thompson and Robert Williams. Two who had been in the Radiation Laboratory also came to work with him: John Tinlot and Robert Hulsizer. All six were more mature than typical graduate students, for they had several years of wartime research experience. Consequently, they were paid a stipend similar to that of a postdoctoral researcher, which was funded by the Office of Naval Research and enabled them to support families during their graduate studies.

For this new phase of his activities, Rossi made a fundamental change of approach. In his words:

=== Elementary Particles ===
With the discovery of the pion in 1947, the search for new elementary particles became a popular research topic. By operating fast ionization chambers within a cloud chamber, Herbert showed that the bursts of ionization they recorded were primarily produced by relatively low energy cosmic rays, whose nuclear interactions typically involve the ejection of several heavily ionising nuclear fragments. On the basis of this effect, he and Rossi demonstrated that the behaviour of these interactions is similar to that of penetrating showers.

Rossi&#x27;s group focused on the use of cloud chambers to study their properties and interactions. In 1948, with the aid of a multi-plate cloud chamber in which lead plates alternated with aluminium ones, Gregory, Rossi and Tinlot showed that the source of the electromagnetic component of cosmic ray interactions was predominantly energetic photons, rather than electrons. This result confirmed Oppenheimer&#x27;s suggestion of 1947 that neutral pions are produced in interactions, along with charged ones, and that this component arises from their rapid decay into photons.

To study the new elementary particles, Bridge and Martin Annis operated a large rectangular multi plate cloud chamber at Echo Lake. This investigation provided the basis for a 1951 PhD thesis by Annis, supervised by Rossi. The next year, these authors, with another student of Rossi&#x27;s, Stanislaw Olbert, showed how to derive information on particle energies from measurements of their multiple scattering. This added another way to use cloud chambers to measure the properties of elementary particles. In early 1953, with Bridge, Richard Safford and Charles Peyrou, Rossi published results of a comprehensive cloud chamber study of the elementary particles that became known as kaons. Peyrou was a visitor from at the École Polytechnique, where he had obtained an accurate value of the muon mass in 1947, and Safford was Rossi&#x27;s student.

=== Bagnères-de-Bigorre conference ===
By 1952, a bewildering &quot;zoo&quot; of elementary particles had been reported, with various masses, decay schemes, nomenclature and reliability of identification. To deal with this situation, Blackett and Leprince-Ringuet organized an International Cosmic Ray Conference at Bagnères-de-Bigorre in 1953. According to James Cronin, &quot;this conference can be placed in importance in the same category as two other famous conferences, the Solvay congress of 1927 and the Shelter Island Conference of 1948.&quot;

Leprince-Ringuet asked Rossi to give a summary of new information presented at the conference and to propose nomenclature for the new particles. Before the conference, in response to the latter assignment, Rossi circulated a suggestion that particles with mass smaller than that of a neutron be designated by small Greek letters and those with larger mass be designated by capital Greek letters. In his talk, on 11 July 1953, he reported that conference results, which he had compiled with the aid of Powell and Fretter, were consistent with this scheme, which was commonly used afterwards.

A highlight was Leprince-Ringuet&#x27;s declaration in his closing talk that: &quot;...in the future we must use particle accelerators.&quot; With the 3 GeV Cosmotron already in operation at Brookhaven National Laboratory, this declaration reflected a consensus among the participants. As a result, Rossi&#x27;s group began to wind down their cloud chamber experiments. However, in 1954, Bridge, Hans Courant, Herbert DeStaebler, Jr. and Rossi reported on an unusual event in which a stopping singly charged particle decayed into three photons whose energies totaled more than the proton rest energy. This is the signature of an antiproton annihilation. The next year, a group led by Owen Chamberlain and Emilio Segrè detected antiprotons, for which they were awarded Nobel Prize in Physics in 1960.

=== Extensive air showers ===
By the time of the Bagnères-de-Bigorre conference, Rossi had already turned his attention toward the astrophysical implications of cosmic ray phenomena, particularly extensive air showers. After Rossi&#x27;s recognition, in Eritrea, that these events exist, they were extensively studied by Pierre Auger, and by Williams. At this time, the extremely fast response of the newly developed scintillation counters offered a new way to study the structure of air showers. To do this, Rossi enlisted his student, George W. Clark, who completed a PhD in 1952, and Piero Bassi, who was a visitor from the University of Padua. Because solid scintillating material was unavailable, they decided to use terphenyl dissolved in benzine, which is an efficient liquid scintillator. With the aid of three counters deployed on the roof of the MIT Physics building during the winter of 1952/53, they found that shower particles arrived within only one or two meters of a disk, which travels at nearly the speed of light in the direction of the shower axis.

This result showed that scintillation counters can not only determine of the arrival times of shower disks at many detectors spread over a large area, but also to estimate the number of particles striking each detector. These capabilities combine the &quot;fast-timing&quot; method of determining shower arrival directions with the density sampling method of determining their size and the location of their axes.

==== Agassiz experiment ====
With this progress, Rossi&#x27;s group began a major experiment that could measure both primary energies and arrival directions of extensive air showers. Participating in this effort were: George Clark, William Kraushaar, John Linsley, James Earl, and Frank Scherb. Kraushaar came to MIT from Cornell in 1949, after earning his PhD under Kenneth Greisen. With the support of Professor Donald Menzel who was director of the Harvard College Observatory, Rossi&#x27;s group deployed fifteen liquid scintillators, of area on the wooded grounds of the observatory&#x27;s Agassiz station. The signals were brought on cables to a Quonset hut, where they were displayed on fifteen oscillographs and recorded photographically.

Shortly after the experiment began to record shower data, lightning ignited the flammable liquid of one of the counters. Local firemen quickly extinguished the resulting fire before it spread to nearby trees, which were soaked with rain water. Because the trees played an essential role in suppressing atmospheric convection that would degrade telescopic observations, Harvard and MIT carried out tense negotiations, until an elaborate system of fire protection was installed, and the experiment was allowed to resume. To eliminate the threat of fire, Clark, Frank Scherb and William B. Smith created a &quot;factory&quot; that made nonflammable plastic scintillator disks, whose thickness was and whose diameter was approximately .

After a switch to plastic in the late spring of 1956, the experiment ran continuously. Its findings were reported in Nature and the Physical Review. The most important results were summarized by Rossi as:
As the Agassiz experiment came to an end, the group realized that observations near the equator and in the southern hemisphere were needed to extend their conclusion that air shower arrival directions are nearly isotropic. Consequently, Clark, in collaboration with Vikram Sarabhai, ran his smaller experiment at Kodaikanal, India, at a latitude of 10° N, and confirmed the absence of anisotropies. Later, at the suggestion of Ismael Escobar, the Agassiz equipment was moved to El Alto at 4200 meters on the Bolivian plateau at 16° S. Here, Clark, Escobar and Juan Hersil found no anisotropies, but they showed that the structure of air showers at their maximum development is different from that at sea level.

==== Volcano Ranch experiment ====
The maximum energy of a particle recorded by Agassiz experiment, 1019 electron volt, is close to energies beyond which charged particles can not be confined to the galactic disc by typical interstellar magnetic fields of 10−5 gauss. A detector array of very large dimensions is needed to detect showers of these energies. John Linsley agreed to take on responsibility for building such an array. He came to MIT in 1954 from the University of Minnesota, where he completed a PhD under Edward P. Ney. Soon, he was joined by Livio Scarsi, whom Rossi had recruited from Occhialini&#x27;s group at the University of Milan.

Because no large enough tract of open land was available near Boston, the array was constructed on a semi-desert property known as&quot;Volcano Ranch&quot;, about west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, at an altitude of . During 1957 and 1958, Linsley and Scarsi deployed 19 scintillation counters, which used fluorescent plastic disks similar to those of the Agassiz detectors, except that each counter incorporated four disks viewed by four photomultipliers. Initially the area of the array was 2.5*106 m2, which is to be compared with Agassiz&#x27;s 105 m2, but in 1960, after Scarsi had returned to Milan, Linsley spread the detectors over an area of 107 m2.

Results from the Volcano Ranch experiment showed that the cosmic-ray intensity decreases smoothly with energy from 1017 - 1018 electron volt. and that primaries in this range arrive isotropically. Of particular significance was the detection of a single particle whose energy of 1020 electron volt is larger than the maximum that could be contained in the galactic disc by galactic magnetic fields. Particles of these energies can only originate in the galactic halo or from beyond the galaxy, and their existence is not consistent with the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit.

=== Space plasma research ===
On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1. This event began the Sputnik crisis, a &quot;wave of near-hysteria&quot; among a surprised American public. In response, the U.S. government increased funding for the National Science Foundation, and in 1958, created both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972. On 4 June 1958, two days after legislation creating NASA was introduced, Detlev W. Bronk, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, met with the heads of these three agencies to create a new advisory body, the Space Science Board, to provide advice for the expansion of space research and to make sure that funding of fundamental science would be properly emphasized.
The Board convened for its first meeting on 27 June 1958. Only four members were already engaged in space research: Rossi, Leo Goldberg, John Simpson, and James Van Allen. Rossi formed a subcommittee which included Thomas Gold, Philip Morrison and biologist Salvador Luria, who agreed that investigations of plasma in interplanetary space would be desirable. Consequently, Rossi decided to turn his group&#x27;s efforts towards its study. With Herbert Bridge, Rossi designed and tested a plasma probe based on the classical Faraday cup. However, to enhance the instrument&#x27;s response to positively charged protons and to suppress its response to photoelectrons produced by sunlight, four grids were deployed within the cup. A key innovation was a modulating voltage applied to one of the grids, which converted the signal into an alternating current, proportional to the proton flux and uncontaminated by any contribution of photoelectrons.

After intense lobbying of Homer Newell, NASA&#x27;s deputy director of space flight programs, Rossi secured a flight opportunity on Explorer 10, &quot;Goddard&#x27;s first home-grown satellite&quot;. The unannounced goal was to hit the Moon, but after launch on 25 March 1961, the satellite went into a highly elongated orbit around Earth, whose apogee, at 70% of the distance to the Moon, was well short of this goal.

Nevertheless, during 52 hours of data recorded by the MIT probe before battery power ran out, Rossi&#x27;s group found a transition between two distinct regions around Earth. Near Earth, there were fairly strong and well organised magnetic fields, but no indication of interplanetary protons. At 22 Earth radii, the spacecraft entered a region where magnetic fields were weaker and more irregular, and where a substantial flux of protons was observed coming from the general direction of the Sun. On several occasions during the rest of the flight, this flux disappeared and then reappeared again, which indicated that the spacecraft was flying close to the boundary between the two regions and that this boundary was moving irregularly. Eventually, this boundary became known as the magnetopause.

Under Bridge and Rossi, the MIT space plasma group included Frank Scherb, Edwin Lyon, Alan Lazarus, Alberto Bonnetti, Alberto Egidi, John Belcher and Constance Dilworth, who was Occhialini&#x27;s wife. Its Faraday cups have collected data on plasma throughout the Solar System: near Earth on OGO-1, OGO 3 and IMP 8, in interplanetary space on WIND, and in the Heliosphere and Heliosheath on &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;.

=== X-Ray astronomy ===

As a consultant to American Science and Engineering, Inc., Rossi initiated the rocket experiments that discovered the first extra-solar source of X-rays, Scorpius X-1. Rossi was made institute professor at MIT in 1966.

=== Retirement ===
Rossi retired from MIT in 1970. From 1974 to 1980 he taught at the University of Palermo. In retirement he wrote a number of monographs, and a 1990 autobiography, &quot;Moments in the Life of a Scientist&quot;, which was published by Cambridge University Press. He died from a cardiac arrest at his home in Cambridge on 21 November 1993. He was survived by his wife, Nora, daughters Florence and Linda and son Frank. He was cremated, and his ashes are in the graveyard of the church of San Miniato al Monte, which overlooks Florence and the hill of Arcetri.

<text>James Garfield Gardiner (30 November 1883 – 12 January 1962) was a Canadian farmer, educator, and politician. He served as the fourth premier of Saskatchewan and as a minister in the Canadian Cabinet.

==Political career==
Gardiner was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1914, served as Minister of Highways (1922–1926) in the government of Premier Charles A. Dunning from 1922, and succeeded Dunning as premier in 1926. A highly-partisan Liberal, his government lost its majority in the legislature in the 1929 election both from patronage scandals and partly through an anti-French, anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant campaign waged by the Ku Klux Klan. Although the Conservative Party had won fewer seats, it was able to defeat the Gardiner government through a motion of no confidence and then formed a &quot;co-operative government&quot; with the support of some Progressive Party and independent Members of the Legislative Assembly.

As Leader of the Opposition, Gardiner accused James Anderson&#x27;s Conservative government of bigotry and alleged that it was linked with the Klan. Gardiner defeated Anderson in the 1934 election and became premier a second time. In 1935, he was involved in negotiations to end the On-to-Ottawa Trek in Regina.

Gardiner left provincial politics later in 1935 to join the federal cabinet of Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King as Minister of Agriculture. He was elected to the House of Commons a few months later. Gardiner held the agriculture portfolio for 22 years until the 1957 federal election resulted the Liberal government bring defeated. Gardiner also served as the first Minister of National War Services, during July 12, 1940June 10, 1941. Gardiner was a powerful figure in both the King and St. Laurent governments.

In 1947, he was sworn of the Imperial Privy Council, which allowed him use of the prenominal honorific The Right Honourable.

Gardiner ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada at the 1948 Liberal leadership convention but lost to Louis St. Laurent. He remained in the House of Commons of Canada until he lost his seat in the 1958 Diefenbaker sweep.

==Personal life==
Gardiner was married three times: first to Rosetta Jane Gardiner in 1912, then to Violet McEwen in 1917 and finally to Isabella (Scott) Christie in 1944. His son James Wilfrid Gardiner served in the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. His other son, Pilot Officer John Edwin (1919–1942), serving with Number 403 Squadron, RCAF, was killed in action while providing air cover and support during the Dieppe Raid on August 19, 1942. The Gardiner family farm was near Lemberg, Saskatchewan.

==Legacy==
As premier of Saskatchewan in 1928, Gardiner championed the Saskatchewan Sanitoria and Hospitals Act, the first legislation to provide free hospitalization and treatment for victims of tuberculosis anywhere in North America. It was passed unanimously by the provincial legislature on January 1, 1929, and is probably one of his least-known legacies to Saskatchewan public policy.

As Minister of National War Services during World War II, Gardiner made a way for conscientious objectors in Canada to perform alternate, non-military service. After deputy ministers stymied a delegation from Canada&#x27;s Anabaptist peace churches, they approached Gardiner directly, where they got a much warmer reception; as Gardiner was a member of the United Church of Canada, which is also theologically committed to global peace. The National War Services Regulations were amended by Parliament on December 24, 1940, to allow for alternate service.

Saskatchewan&#x27;s Gardiner Dam, declared open on June 21, 1967, is named after him.

In 2006, the CBC agreed to pull the movie &quot;Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story&quot; from all broadcasts in response to criticism about its portrayals of Gardiner.

== Electoral history ==

=== Saskatchewan general elections, 1929 and 1934 ===

Gardiner led the Liberal Party in two general elections, in 1929 and 1934. The 1929 election resulted in a Conservative minority government, but Gardiner won the 1934 election with a majority government.

==== 1929 general election ====


Gardiner had succeeded Dunning as premier in 1926 and led the Liberals into the general election in 1929. Although Gardiner and the Liberals won pluralities in the popular vote and seats in the Assembly, they did not hold a majority. Gardiner chose to face the Assembly in hopes of obtaining sufficient support from some of the opposition members to maintain his government, but he lost a vote on a confidence matter and resigned. He was replaced as premier by James Anderson, whose Conservative Party held the second-greatest number of seats.

1 Premier when election was called; lost confidence motion in the Assembly after the election; resigned as Premier and became Leader of the Opposition.&lt;br&gt;
2 Co-Leader of the Opposition when the election was called; became Premier after successful non-confidence vote.

==== 1934 general election ====


Gardiner remained leader of the Liberals and led them into the 1934 election, at the depths of the Great Depression. The Liberals won a substantial majority government, taking fifty of the fifty-five seats in the Legislative Assembly. The election was a crushing defeat for the Conservatives under Anderson, who failed to win a single seat. The Farmer-Labour Party won five seats and formed the Opposition.

1 Leader of the Opposition when election was called; Premier after the election.&lt;br&gt;
2 Party leader during the election, but failed to win seat; role as Leader of the Opposition taken by George Hara Williams&lt;br&gt;
3 Premier when election was called; lost seat in the election and retired.

=== Saskatchewan constituency elections ===

Gardiner stood for election to the Legislative Assembly seven times, once in a by-election and in six general elections. He was elected six times in the constituency of North Qu&#x27;Appelle, and the seventh and last election in the constituency of Melville. He was elected twice by acclamation, and five times in contested elections.

==== 1914 By-election: North Qu&#x27;Appelle ====

The by-election was called on the resignation of the sitting Conservative member, John Archibald McDonald, who admitted to &quot;corrupt practices&quot; by his agent in the 1912 general election.

Gardiner stood for election to the House of Commons seven times from 1936 to 1958, in two different Saskatchewan ridings (Assiniboia originally, and then Melville for the next six elections). He was elected six times. After his defeat in the 1958 election, he retired from politics.

<doc id="520738" wikidata="Q1354363" url="?curid=520738" title="A. Mitchell Palmer">
<text>Alexander Mitchell Palmer (May 4, 1872 – May 11, 1936) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 50th United States attorney general from 1919 to 1921. He is best known for overseeing the Palmer Raids during the Red Scare of 1919–20.

He became a member of the Democratic Party and won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1909 to 1915. During World War I, he served as Alien Property Custodian, taking charge of the seizure of enemy property.

President Woodrow Wilson appointed Palmer to be Attorney General in 1919. In reaction to domestic unrest, Palmer created the General Intelligence Unit and recruited J. Edgar Hoover to head the new organization. Beginning in November 1919, Palmer launched a series of raids that rounded up and deported numerous suspected radicals. Though the American public initially supported the raids, Palmer&#x27;s raids earned backlash from civil rights activists and legal scholars. He received further backlash when a series of attacks on May Day 1920 that he had raised grave concerns about did not materialize.

Palmer sought the presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, but he faced strong opposition from labor groups and the nomination went to James M. Cox. He resumed the private practice of law and remained active in Democratic politics until his death in 1936.

==Early life and education==
Palmer was born into a Quaker family near White Haven, Pennsylvania, in the small town of Moosehead, on May 4, 1872. He was educated in the public schools and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moravian Parochial School. Palmer graduated from Swarthmore College in 1891. At Swarthmore, he was a member of the Pennsylvania Kappa chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. After graduation, he was appointed court stenographer of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 43rd judicial district. He studied law at Lafayette College and George Washington University, and continued his studies with attorney John Brutzman Storm.

== Career ==
He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1893, and began to practice in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, in partnership with Storm. Palmer also had various business interests, including serving on the board of directors of the Scranton Trust Company, Stroudsburg National Bank, International Boiler Company, Citizens&#x27; Gas Company, and Stroudsburg Water Company. He also became active in politics as a Democrat, to include membership on the executive committee of the Pennsylvania State Democratic Committee.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Palmer was elected as a Democrat to the 61st, 62nd, and 63rd Congresses and served from March 4, 1909, to March 3, 1915. From the start he won important party assignments, serving as vice-chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in his first term and managing the assignment of office space in his second term.

As a congressman, Palmer aligned himself with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, advocating lower tariffs despite the popularity of tariffs in his home district and state. In his second term, he won a seat on the Ways and Means Committee chaired by Oscar Underwood. There he was the principal author of the detailed tariff schedules that a Republican Senator denounced as &quot;the most radical departure in the direction of free trade that has been proposed by any party during the last 70 years.&quot; He argued that tariffs profited business and had no benefit for workers. Pennsylvania industry, notably the large mining and manufacturing firms, bellicosely opposed his tariff scheme. As Palmer stated: &quot;I have received my notice from the Bethlehem Steel Company. ... I am marked again for slaughter at their hands.&quot;

Palmer defeated Pennsylvania&#x27;s incumbent Democratic National Committeeman, Colonel , by a resounding margin of 110 to 71 at the State Party&#x27;s annual convention in 1912. Guffey had been a dominant force in state Democratic politics for a half-century; his defeat at the hands of Palmer was seen as a major victory for the Progressive-wing of the State Party, though Guffey&#x27;s nephew, Joe, would go on to succeed Palmer as the state&#x27;s National Committeeman in 1920. Palmer served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in both 1912 and 1916. At the 1912 Convention, he played a key role in holding the Pennsylvania delegation together in voting for Woodrow Wilson. Following the election of 1912, Palmer hoped to join Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet as Attorney General. When he was offered Secretary of War instead, he declined citing his Quaker beliefs and heritage. He wrote to the President:

In his third congressional term Palmer chaired his party&#x27;s caucus in the House of Representatives and served on the five-man executive committee that directed the Democratic Party&#x27;s national affairs. Continuing to champion tariff reduction, he even accepted lower tariffs on the one economic sector he had tried to protect, the wool industry. He proposed to pay for any lost revenue with a graduated income tax targeted only at the rich. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said he gave &quot;the ablest speech of the day&quot; when the House debated the measure in April 1913. He said:

Palmer&#x27;s work became part of the Underwood Tariff Act of 1913, signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson.

Other progressive legislation Palmer proposed included a bill outlawing the employment of workers below a certain age in quarries and requiring quarries to be inspected. He noted that recent Welsh victims of quarry accidents were &quot;a high class of workman –not cheap foreign labor.&quot; Late in his congressional career, he sponsored a bill to promote women&#x27;s suffrage. On behalf of the National Child Labor Committee he offered another to end child labor in most American mines and factories. Wilson found it constitutionally unsound and after the House voted 232 to 44 in favor on February 15, 1915, he allowed it to die in the Senate. Nevertheless, Arthur Link has called it &quot;a turning point in American constitutional history&quot; because it attempted to establish for the first time &quot;the use of the commerce power to justify almost any form of federal control over working conditions and wages.&quot;

In 1914, President Wilson persuaded him to give up his House seat and run instead for the United States Senate. The depression of that year highlighted his controversial tariff position. He came in last in the three-man race, behind second-place finisher Gifford Pinchot, who was later a Republican Governor and ran on the Progressive Party line, and incumbent Republican Boies Penrose.

===Alien Property Custodian===
Leaving Congress in March 1915, Palmer decided to leave public office. When Wilson offered him a lifetime position on the Court of Claims, he at first accepted, but then arranged for a postponement so he could continue serving on the Democratic National Committee. His attachment to party affairs eventually forced him to withdraw from consideration for a judicial post. He sought other positions without success while continuing to fight for control of patronage positions in Pennsylvania. He worked for the Wilson campaign in the 1916 elections, but Pennsylvania voted Republican as usual.

Palmer proved out of step with the public mood when, after the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; in May 1915, he offered reporters his opinion that &quot;the entire nation should not be asked to suffer&quot; to avenge the deaths of passengers who had ignored warnings not to travel on ships that carried munitions.

Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I in April 1917, Palmer volunteered, despite his Quaker background, to &quot;carry a gun as a private&quot; if necessary, or to &quot;work in any capacity without compensation.&quot; He chaired his local draft board for a time, while Herbert Hoover, head of the new Food Administration refused to appoint him to a post in his agency. In October, he accepted an appointment from Wilson as Alien Property Custodian an office he held from October 22, 1917, until March 4, 1919. A wartime agency, the Custodian had responsibility for the seizure, administration, and sometimes the sale of enemy property in the United States. Palmer&#x27;s background in law and banking qualified him for the position, along with his party loyalty and intimate knowledge of political patronage.

The size of the assets the Custodian controlled only became clear over the next year. Late in 1918, Palmer reported he was managing almost 30,000 trusts with assets worth $500 million. He estimated that another 9,000 trusts worth $300 million awaited evaluation. Many of the enterprises in question produced materials significant to the war effort, such as medicines, glycerin for explosives, charcoal for gas masks. Others ranged from mines to brewing to newspaper publishing. Palmer built a team of professionals with banking expertise as well as an investigative bureau to track down well-hidden assets. Below the top-level positions, he distributed jobs as patronage. For example, he appointed one of his fellow members of the Democratic National Committee to serve as counsel for a textile company and another the vice-president of a shipping line. Always thinking like a politician, he made sure his group&#x27;s efforts were well publicized.

In September 1918, Palmer testified at hearings held by the U.S. Senate&#x27;s Overman Committee that the United States Brewers Association (USBA) and the rest of the overwhelmingly German liquor industry harbored pro-German sentiments. He stated that &quot;German brewers of America, in association with the United States Brewers&#x27; Association&quot; had attempted &quot;to buy a great newspaper&quot; and &quot;control the government of State and Nation&quot;, had generally been &quot;unpatriotic&quot;, and had &quot;pro-German sympathies&quot;.

As Alien Property Custodian, Palmer campaigned successfully to have his powers to dispose of assets by sale increased to counter Germany&#x27;s long-term plan to conquer the world by industrial expansion even after the war. Even after Germany&#x27;s surrender, Palmer continued the campaign to make American industry independent of German ownership, with major sales in the metals industry in the spring of 1919, for example. He offered his rationale in a speech to an audience of lawyers: &quot;The war power is of necessity an inherent power in every sovereign nation. It is the power of self-preservation and that power has no limits other than the extent of the emergency.&quot;

===Attorney general===

When President Wilson needed to fill the position of Attorney General at the start of 1919, party officials, including Palmer&#x27;s colleagues on the Democratic National Committee and many recipients of his patronage during his tenure as Alien Property Custodian, backed him against Sherman L. Whipple and other candidates with stronger legal credentials. They argued that the South was over-represented in the Cabinet and that Palmer&#x27;s political intelligence was critical. Joseph Tumulty, the President&#x27;s private secretary, advised the President that the office had &quot;great power politically. We should not trust it to anyone who is not heart and soul with us.&quot; He pressed the President several times. He cabled Wilson in Paris: &quot;Recognition of Palmer ...would be most helpful and cheering to young men of the party...You will make no mistake if appointment is made. It will give us all heart and new courage. Party know of need in tonic like this.&quot; He called Palmer &quot;young, militant, progressive and fearless.&quot; The President sent Palmer&#x27;s nomination to the Senate on February 27, 1919, and Palmer took office as a recess appointment on March 5.

Palmer served as Attorney General from March 5, 1919, until March 4, 1921. Before assuming office, he had opposed the American Protective League (APL), an organization of private citizens that conducted numerous raids and surveillance activities aimed at those who failed to register for the draft and immigrants of German ancestry who were suspected of sympathies for Germany. One of Palmer&#x27;s first acts was to release 10,000 aliens of German ancestry who had been taken into government custody during World War I. He stopped accepting intelligence information gathered by the APL. Conversely, he refused to share information in his APL-provided files when Ohio Governor James M. Cox requested it. He called the APL materials &quot;gossip, hearsay information, conclusions, and inferences&quot; and added that &quot;information of this character could not be used without danger of doing serious wrong to individuals who were probably innocent.&quot; In March 1919, when some in Congress and the press were urging him to reinstate the Justice Department&#x27;s wartime relationship with the APL, he told reporters that &quot;its operation in any community constitutes a grave menace.&quot;

====Palmer Raids====

=====Assassination attempt and bombings=====
The Palmer Raids occurred in the larger context of the Red Scare, the term given to fear of and reaction against communist radicals in the U.S. in the years immediately following World War I. Strikes garnered national attention, race riots occurred in over 30 US cities, and two sets of bombings took place in April and June 1919, including attacks on Palmer&#x27;s home.

A first booby-trap bomb directed at assassinating Palmer was mailed by anarchists linked to Luigi Galleani. This first bomb was intercepted and defused, but two months later, Palmer and his family narrowly escaped death when an anarchist exploded a bomb on their porch at 2132 R Street, N.W., Washington D.C. The home of a Department of Justice Bureau of Investigation (BOI) field agent Rayme Weston Finch was also attacked. Finch had previously arrested two prominent Galleanists while leading a police raid on the offices of their publication &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;.

In total, April 1919 saw 36 dynamite-filled bombs mailed to other leading figures including justice officials, newspaper editors and businessmen, including John D. Rockefeller.

=====Response and raids=====
Palmer initially moved slowly to find a way to attack the source of the violence. An initial raid in July 1919 against a very small anarchist group in Buffalo failed when a federal judge tossed out his case. In August, he organized the General Intelligence Unit within the Department of Justice and recruited J. Edgar Hoover, a 24-year-old law school graduate who spent the war working in and then leading the Justice Department&#x27;s Enemy Alien Bureau, to head it. On October 17, 1919, just a year after the Immigration Act of 1918 had expanded the definition of aliens that could be deported, the U.S. Senate demanded Palmer explain his failure to move against radicals. Palmer&#x27;s reply on November 17 described the threat anarchists and Bolsheviks posed to the government. More than half the report documented radicalism in the black community and the &quot;open defiance&quot; black leaders advocated in response to racial violence and rioting of the past summer.

Palmer launched his campaign against radicalism in November 1919 and January 1920 with a series of police actions known as the Palmer Raids. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken. Only the dismissal of most of the cases by Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis Freeland Post limited the number of deportations to 556. At a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson to fire Post, but Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should &quot;not let this country see red.&quot; Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President&#x27;s &quot;admonition,&quot; because Palmer &quot;was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages.&quot;

Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public initially supported the raids. Civil rights activists, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Louis Freeland Post, asserted the rule of law in opposition to Palmer&#x27;s campaign, and congressional attempts to impeach or censure Louis Post were short-lived, though Palmer was allowed to defend himself in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919. Much of the press applauded Louis Post&#x27;s work at Labor as well, and Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative results of the raids. 

====Labor and business====
Palmer had a pro-labor record in Congress though he was never very successful at winning labor&#x27;s votes in elections. Through most of 1919 he did not join the growing chorus of anti-union sentiment and anti-Red rhetoric that greeted the Seattle General Strike and the Boston Police Strike. His potential rivals for the presidency in 1920 were not inactive. In September and October 1919, General Leonard Wood led U.S. military forces against striking steel workers in Gary, Indiana. Employers claimed the strikers had revolutionary objectives and military intelligence seconded those charges, so Wood added acclaim as an anti-labor and anti-radical champion to his reputation as a military hero, critic of Wilson, and leading candidate for the Republican nomination for President in 1920.

=====Coal strike=====

The railroad and coal strike scheduled for November 1, 1919, roused Palmer. The Senate, on October 17, had already challenged him to demonstrate what action he was taking against foreign radicals. Now these two industries faced disruption as prices continued to rise and shortages threatened, even as the presidential election year of 1920 approached. The railroad brotherhoods postponed their strike in the face of political and public opposition, but the United Mine Workers under John L. Lewis went forward. Palmer invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities. The law, meant to punish hoarding and profiteering, had never been used against a union. Certain of united political backing and almost universal public support, Palmer obtained an injunction on October 31 and 400,000 coal workers struck the next day.

Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) at first attempted to mediate between Palmer and Lewis, but after several days called the injunction &quot;so autocratic as to stagger the human mind.&quot; The coal operators smeared the strikers with charges that Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press echoed that language. Palmer&#x27;s public rhetoric was restrained throughout. He eschewed characterizing labor&#x27;s action as some others did –&quot;insurrection&quot; and &quot;Bolshevik revolution&quot;, for example –and made straightforward statements about what the government of necessity had to do. Responding to an AFL attack he wrote:

Lewis, facing criminal charges, withdrew his strike call, though many strikers ignored his action. As the strike dragged on into its third week, coal supplies were running low and public sentiment was calling for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came on December 10. Palmer&#x27;s tough stand won him considerable praise from business and professional groups. He received one letter that said: &quot;A lion-hearted man, with a great nation behind him, has brought order out of chaos. You have shown...that the United States is not a myth, but a virile, mighty power which shows itself when a man who measures up to the duties of the hour is at the helm.&quot; Such support stiffened his resolve in the next labor crisis.

The coal strike also had political consequences. At one point Palmer asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson who had opposed Palmer&#x27;s plan. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer&#x27;s attempt to deport radicals was largely frustrated by the Department of Labor.

====May Day warnings====
Within Palmer&#x27;s Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID), headed by J. Edgar Hoover, had become a storehouse of information about radicals in America. It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID knew there was a gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric and what they were capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.

With Palmer&#x27;s backing, Hoover warned the nation to expect the worst: assassinations, bombings, and general strikes. Palmer issued his own warning on April 29, 1920, claiming to have a &quot;list of marked men&quot; and said domestic radicals were &quot;in direct connection and unison&quot; with European counterparts with disruptions planned for the same day there. Newspapers headlined his words: &quot;Terror Reign by Radicals, says Palmer&quot; and &quot;Nation-wide Uprising on Saturday.&quot; Localities prepared their police forces and some states mobilized their militias. New York City&#x27;s 11,000-man police force worked for 32 hours straight. Boston police mounted machine guns on automobiles and positioned them around the city.

The date came and went without incident. Newspaper reaction was almost uniform in its mockery of Palmer and his &quot;hallucinations.&quot; Clarence Darrow called it the &quot;May Day scare.&quot; The &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; asked the Attorney General to cease his alerts: &quot;We can never get to work if we keep jumping sideways in fear of the bewiskered Bolshevik.&quot; Palmer&#x27;s embarrassment buttressed Louis Freeland&#x27;s position in opposition to the Palmer raids when he testified before a Congressional Committee on May 7–8.

===Later career===

Palmer sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for President in 1920. Campaigning during the Georgia primary, he said: &quot;I am myself an American and I love to preach my doctrine before undiluted one hundred percent Americans, because my platform is, in a word, undiluted Americanism and undying loyalty to the republic.&quot; Journalist Heywood Broun pretended to investigate: &quot;We assumed, of course, from the tone of Mr. Palmer&#x27;s manifesto that his opponents for the nomination were Rumanians, Greeks and Icelanders, and weak-kneed ones at that...We happened into Cox&#x27;s headquarters wholly by accident and were astounded to discover that he, too, is an American. ... Thus encouraged we went to all camps and found that the candidates are all Americans.&quot; Palmer had considerable support among party professionals, but no track record as a campaigner or a vote winner. He won delegates in the Michigan and Georgia primaries but did so without demonstrating voter appeal. He also faced strong opposition from labor for his use of an injunction against striking coal miners in the fall of 1919. Though he probably never had a chance of winning the nomination, he ran a respectable third until his support collapsed on the convention&#x27;s 39th ballot and the nomination shortly thereafter went to Ohio Governor James Cox.

In 1921, in the closing weeks of the Wilson administration, Palmer asked the President to pardon imprisoned Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, whose health was said to be failing. He suggested the birthday of President Lincoln as an appropriate day for the announcement, noting Lincoln&#x27;s willingness to forgive the Confederate South. Wilson&#x27;s response was &quot;Never!&quot;, and he wrote &quot;Denied&quot; across the clemency petition.

After retiring from government service in March 1921, Palmer went into the private practice of law and continued to act the role of a senior statesman of the Democratic Party. Widowed when his wife Roberta Dixon died on January 4, 1922, he married Margaret Fallon Burrall in 1923.

After the Republicans won the national election of 1924 in a landslide, he was quick to congratulate Governor Al Smith of New York on his re-election and declare him the party&#x27;s new leader, and he backed Smith for the Democratic nomination in 1928.

As a Roosevelt supporter and a delegate from the District of Columbia, Palmer served as one of nine members on the Platform Committee of the 1932 Democratic National Convention and authored the original draft of the platform. &quot;Time&quot; magazine later credited him with the platform&#x27;s opposition to forgiving the debts of America&#x27;s allies in World War I and its promise to reduce government expenditures by 25%. Palmer said that the savings could be devoted to programs to relieve unemployment. With the repeal of prohibition a major campaign issue, Palmer used his expertise as the Attorney General who first enforced Prohibition to promote a plan to expedite its repeal through state conventions rather than the state legislatures.

== Death ==
On May 11, 1936, at Emergency Hospital in Washington, D.C., Palmer died from cardiac complications following an appendectomy two weeks earlier. Upon his death, Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings said &quot;He was a great lawyer, a distinguished public servant and an outstanding citizen. He was my friend of many years&#x27; standing and his death brings to me a deep sense of personal loss and sorrow.&quot; He was buried at Laurelwood Cemetery (originally a cemetery of the Society of Friends) in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

<text>The Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC), commonly called the Goldstone Observatory, is a satellite ground station located in Fort Irwin in the U.S. state of California. Operated by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), its main purpose is to track and communicate with interplanetary space missions. It is named after Goldstone, California, a nearby gold-mining ghost town.

The station is one of three satellite communication stations in the NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program’s Deep Space Network (DSN), whose mission is to provide the vital two-way communications link that tracks and controls interplanetary spacecraft and receives the images and scientific information they collect. The others are the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex in Spain and the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia. These three stations are located at separations of approximately 120° longitude so that as the Earth rotates a spacecraft will always be in sight of at least one station.

The complex includes the Pioneer Deep Space Station (aka DSS 11), which is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.

 Five large parabolic (dish) antennas are located at the Goldstone site to handle the workload, since at any given time the DSN is responsible for maintaining communication with up to 30 spacecraft. The antennas function similarly to a home satellite dish. However, since the spacecraft they communicate with are much farther away than the communication satellites which home satellite dishes use, the signals received are much weaker, requiring a larger aperture antenna to gather enough radio energy to make them intelligible. The largest, a 70-meter (230 ft) Cassegrain antenna, is used for communication with space missions to the outer planets, such as the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft, which, at 21.5 billion kilometers, is the most distant manmade object from Earth. The radio frequencies used for spacecraft communication are in the microwave part of the radio spectrum; S band (2.29–2.30 GHz), X band (8.40–8.50 GHz) and Ka band (31.8–32.3 GHz). In addition to receiving radio signals from the spacecraft (downlink signals), the antennas also transmit commands to the spacecraft (uplink signals) with high power radio transmitters (80 kW) powered by klystron tubes.

A major goal in the design of the station is to reduce interference with the weak incoming downlink radio signals by natural and manmade radio noise. The remote Mojave Desert location was chosen because it is far from manmade sources of radio noise such as motor vehicles. The RF front ends of the radio receivers at the dishes use ruby masers, consisting of a bar of synthetic ruby cooled by liquid helium to 4.5 K to minimize the noise introduced by the electronics.

When not needed for spacecraft communication, the Goldstone antennas are used as sensitive radio telescopes for astronomical research, such as mapping quasars and other celestial radio sources; radar mapping planets, the Moon, comets and asteroids; spotting comets and asteroids with the potential to strike Earth; and the search for ultra-high energy neutrino interactions in the Moon by using large-aperture radio antennas.

==History==
The Goldstone complex was created in 1958 by the JPL to support the Pioneer program of deep space exploration probes. Its location was determined by two criteria: a bowl-shaped environment was needed, and it needed to be distant from terrestrial sources of radio interference. This site, on the grounds of Fort Irwin in the Mojave Desert, was found to meet the criteria. Construction of the first radio telescope, DSS 11 or the Pioneer Deep Space Station, was begun by the United States Army and taken over by NASA after its creation. It is a parabolic Cassegrain antenna capable of receiving signals in the 1 to 3 GHz range. It was taken out of service in 1981, having been technologically bypassed by later telescopes. It was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1985 for its pioneering role in deep space exploration.

==&quot;Goldstone has the bird&quot;==
It is commonly believed that the first American satellite, Explorer 1, was confirmed to be in orbit by the use of the phrase &quot;Goldstone has the bird&quot;. However, Goldstone was not in operation at the time of Explorer 1, and like many oft-repeated quotations it is incorrect. Others claim that the actual phrase was &quot;Gold has it!&quot;, incorrectly identifying &quot;Gold&quot; as a temporary tracking station at Earthquake Valley, east of Julian, California. In fact, Gold Station was located at the Air Force Missile Test Center (AFMTC) in Florida and the temporary tracking station at Earthquake Valley was Red Station. Probably this detection of the Explorer 1 signal was actually made at the Minitrack station at Brown Field, a US Navy airfield near San Diego. This station was later moved to Goldstone, accounting for the error.

==Complex tours==
The Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex has temporarily suspended tours for the public. However, there is a Visitor Center located in Harvey House, 681 North First Avenue, Barstow, CA 92311. Operating hours are Monday, Wednesday and Fridays from 9AM - 3PM. There is no entry fee and no need to make reservations to stop by the Visitor Center.

== In popular culture ==
The 70m dish also known as Mars or DSS14 is featured in the opening sequences of the 1968 film &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;.

The Goldstone Facility was prominently featured in Part 1 of &quot;The Incredible Hulk (TV Series)&quot; episode, &quot;Prometheus&quot;.

&quot;A Boy and His Dog (1975 film)&quot; used the facility for the industrial looking entrance sequence to the film&#x27;s world of &quot;Down Under&quot; according to the director&#x27;s commentary (not without difficulty - the filming crew had a hard time getting access).
