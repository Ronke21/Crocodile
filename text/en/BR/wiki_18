<text>Pangnirtung (or Pang, also Pangniqtuuq, in syllabics: ᐸᖕᓂᖅᑑᖅ ) is an Inuit hamlet, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, located on Baffin Island. The community is located about south of the Arctic Circle, and about from the North Pole. Pangnirtung is situated on a coastal plain at the coast of Pangnirtung Fjord, a fjord which eventually merges with Cumberland Sound. As of October 2024, the mayor is Stevie Komoartok.

==Name==
There is some confusion about the village name. Residents say the real name is &quot;Pangniqtuuq&quot;, which means &quot;the place of many bull caribou&quot;. Early in 2005 residents voted against officially changing the name of the village to the native one, as Pangnirtung has achieved an international reputation. Its residents have created high-quality traditional arts in sculpture, as well as adaptation of themes and design in printmaking and weaving.

Pangnirtung is nicknamed the &quot;Switzerland of the Arctic&quot;, or simply Pang.

==History==
The Inuit and their ancestors, Paleo-Eskimo, have inhabited the area for thousands of years, perhaps up to 4000 years. Their cultures became well-adapted to the climate and environment.

Contact with European Canadians has been limited to less than the last century. In 1921, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a trading post in Pangnirtung. Two years later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police erected a permanent office. The first government-appointed teacher arrived in 1956. The first administrative office was established in 1962.

Since then, numerous Inuit have achieved success with marketing their traditional arts. They transformed traditional drawing skills to produce lithographs and other forms of prints, allowing reproduction and wider distribution of their work. Other artists have made sculptures and carvings in local stone. Since the government established a weaving studio in 1970, many Inuit have learned to weave and are producing tapestries and other works that find an international market.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Pangnirtung had a population of 1,504 living in 396 of its 456 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,481. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Geography and climate==
Pangnirtung has a tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Ftkd&quot;) with very short, cool summers and long, cold winters lasting almost the entire year.
==Economic development==
The community operates a turbot fishery. In 2008, the federal government budgeted for the construction of a harbour. Pangnirtung Fisheries Limited operates a packing plant to process local turbot catches. Founded in 1992 during peak summer operations the company has over 40 employees during peak season.

Auyuittuq Lodge is the hamlet&#x27;s only hotel, which comprises 25 rooms, shared facilities, a dining room, and a lounge.

== Local services ==
Power is supplied to Pangnirtung via standalone diesel generators operated by Qulliq Energy.

Fuel is imported via tanker and stored in a tank farm near the Pangnirtung Airport. The purchase of diesel fuel is the responsibility of the government of Nunavut.

Water, sewage, and garbage services are provided by the municipality of Pangnirtung. Water trucks fill up at a reservoir adjacent to the hamlet and deliver seven days a week. Sewage is pumped out and treated at the municipal treatment plant. Garbage is picked up five days a week and transported to a landfill that slowly deteriorates due to Arctic temperatures.

For emergency services it is protected by the 14-member Pangnirtung Fire Department. The fire service uses one pumper with one older reserve from one station. Policing is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pangnirtung Detachment attached to V Division.

Mini C, The North West Company (Northern Store), Pangnirtung Inuit Co-op and Co-op Express are the only local retailers and grocery options. KFC Express, Pizza Hut and Co-op Express are the only fast food restaurants in the hamlet. Perishable goods are shipped by air and all other items by sealift when waters are ice-free.

Banking is done through the Co-op or money orders

Gasoline for cars or snowmobiles is done at the Quickstop or the Co-op.

==Education==
There are two schools in Pangnirtung:
* Alookie Elementary School - kindergarten to Grade 5
* Attagoyuk Ilisavik High School - Grades 6 to 12

Post secondary-studies opportunities can be made through Nunavut Arctic College&#x27;s Community Learning Centre.

==Recreation==
Aksayuk Arena is a sports and recreational centre.

== Transportation ==
Like all Nunavut communities Pangnirtung is a fly-in community with no road access to the rest of Nunavut. Pangnirtung Airport provides the only viable means of access. There are gravel roads in the community and residents use SUV&#x27;s, pickup trucks, 4-wheel ATV&#x27;s and snowmobiles.

==Places of worship==
Two churches can be found in Pangnirtung:
* St. Luke&#x27;s Anglican Church
* Full Gospel (Pentecostal) Church

==Health==
Basic medical services are available at the Health Centre. Four beds are available for assessment only, with advance care via medevac to Iqaluit.

== Near Pangnirtung ==
Pangnirtung is the nearest town (1 hour by boat) to Auyuittuq National Park and the location of one of two park offices, the other is in Qikiqtarjuaq. Located near to the Parks Canada office is the Angmarlik Visitor Centre. Iglunga, now uninhabited, is an Inuit hamlet, just south of Iglunga Island, is about to the west.
===Small craft harbour===
In 2009, the then Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, proposed building a new modern harbour in Pangnirtung to support the region&#x27;s turbot-fishing industry. Harper received a warm welcome with many residents gathered at the airport to greet him. The town&#x27;s 1,500 residents listened as Harper announced that $17 million worth of harbour construction promised in the last two budgets would get under way in the fall of that year. Harper said the greatest potential for the hamlet&#x27;s future lies in the inshore turbot fishery. The shortfalls of the previous harbour were a big problem for fishermen: When the tide ebbed, the harbour turned to mud.

The work on the harbour was completed in September 2013. The entire project ended up costing about $40.5 million. The improvements to the harbour include a fixed wharf, breakwater, marshalling area, sea lift ramp and a dredged channel and basin. The improvements will allow residents to unload their catches faster by allowing smaller crafts to dock easily and safely.

== Broadband communications ==
The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

==In popular culture==
The 2022 Canadian Inuit science fiction film &quot;Slash/Back&quot; was filmed in Pangnirtung. It was directed by Nyla Innuksuk in her feature debut, and starred largely local actors recruited for the film.

<doc id="513843" wikidata="Q2360590" url="?curid=513843" title="The Vicar of Dibley">
<text>The Vicar of Dibley is a British sitcom. It consists of three series, which aired on BBC One from 10 November 1994 to 1 January 2000, and several specials, the most recent of which aired on 23 December 2020. It is set in the fictional Oxfordshire village of Dibley, which is assigned a female vicar following the 1993 changes in the Church of England that permitted the ordination of women. Dawn French plays the lead role of vicar Geraldine Granger.

In ratings terms, it is among the most successful British programmes in the digital era, with the Christmas and New Year specials entering the UK top 10 programmes of the year.
&quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; received multiple British Comedy Awards, two International Emmys and was a multiple British Academy Television Awards nominee. In 2004, it placed third in a BBC poll of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcoms&quot;.

==Premise==
===Background===
The series was created by Richard Curtis and written for actress Dawn French by Curtis and Paul Mayhew-Archer, with contributions from Kit Hesketh-Harvey. The main character was an invention of Richard Curtis, but he and French extensively consulted Joy Carroll, one of the first female Anglican priests, and garnered many character traits and much information.

===Openings and epilogues===
In earlier episodes, the opening credits were followed by a humorous village scene, such as a woman knitting directly from a sheep.

After the closing credits, Geraldine usually tells Alice a joke, which Alice either overreacts to, tries to interpret literally, or understands only after Geraldine explains it. There are a few exceptions to this in various episodes.

==Cast and characters==
===Main cast===


===Recurring cast===
===Guest appearances===
Hugh Bonneville, Mel Giedroyc, Richard Griffiths, Miranda Hart, Alistair McGowan, Geraldine McNulty, Philip Whitchurch, Nathalie Cox, Nicholas Le Prevost, Brian Perkins, and Roger Sloman have all made one guest appearance each.

Pam Rhodes, Kylie Minogue, Rachel Hunter, Terry Wogan, Jeremy Paxman, Martyn Lewis, Darcey Bussell and Sean Bean each appeared as themselves in one episode.

Sarah, Duchess of York, Richard Ayoade, Orla Brady, Fiona Bruce, Annette Crosbie, Johnny Depp, Ruth Jones, Hilary Kay, Damian Lewis, Maureen Lipman, Jennifer Saunders, Sting and his wife Trudie Styler, Stephen Tompkinson, Dervla Kirwan, and Emma Watson have made guest appearances in short charity specials.

==Episodes==

&quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; has had 20 episodes as of 2007, with additional short reprises consisting of Comic Relief and the &quot;In Lockdown&quot; minis.

The first series was broadcast on BBC1 from 10 November to 15 December 1994, comprising six episodes. Following the first series, an Easter special and a Christmas special were broadcast in 1996. A four-episode second series was ordered and screened between 26 December 1997 and 22 January 1998. Subsequent episodes consisted of Christmas and New Year specials, followed by a third series of four episodes, also referred to as seasonal specials as they have the titles &quot;Autumn&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot; and &quot;Summer&quot; airing from 24 December 1999 to 1 January 2000. After that came the two-episode &quot;A Very Dibley Christmas&quot;, broadcast between 25 December 2004 and 1 January 2005, and the two-part finale, &quot;A Wholly Holy Happy Ending&quot;, broadcast on Christmas Day 2006 and New Year&#x27;s Day 2007.

The final two episodes, in which Geraldine finds love and marries, are officially the &quot;last-ever&quot; episodes, although there have been several reappearances of certain characters since in the form of charity specials.

===Comic Relief and Lockdown specials===
On 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as Geraldine Granger as part of her &quot;French and Saunders&quot; marathon on BBC Radio 2. She was interviewed by Chris Evans on his &quot;Pause for Thought&quot; section. The following year, on 29 March 2014, French appeared in character as Granger on &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

There have been eight short charity TV specials: six for Comic Relief between 1997 and 2015 and a seventh in April 2020, in which French appeared on &quot;The Big Night In&quot; as part of a joint Comic Relief and Children in Need special to support those affected by COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the segment was filmed at French&#x27;s home. For Comic Relief 2021, Geraldine appeared in the Dibley vicarage, later lip-synching to &quot;Juice&quot; by Lizzo and appearing with the reverend Kate Bottley.

In December 2020, a series of short &quot;lockdown&quot; episodes of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; were broadcast. The series consisted of three short episodes followed by a compilation episode of the previous three episodes&#x27; material shown back-to-back, but including previously unseen material and scenes. The style was completely different to the main series, with Geraldine and Hugo breaking the fourth wall via video messaging, talking directly to the viewers as if they were the Dibley congregation. The same method was used for the 2020 and 2021 Comic Relief shorts, also made and set during the Covid pandemic.

==Production==
===Location and setting===
The programme is set in the fictional Oxfordshire village of Dibley. Some villagers, including Alice, Jim, and Owen, speak with slight West Country accents, as were once common in Oxfordshire, but are now less so. The series was filmed in the Buckinghamshire village of Turville, near High Wycombe, with the village&#x27;s St Mary the Virgin Church doubling as Dibley&#x27;s St Barnabus. The exterior location for David Horton&#x27;s manor is in the village of Little Missenden, Buckinghamshire.

The opening titles show aerial shots of the M40 motorway&#x27;s Stokenchurch Gap, the Chiltern Hills of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and the village of Turville.

===Theme music===
The theme music was a setting of Psalm 23 composed by Howard Goodall, and was performed by the choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, with George Humphreys singing the solo. The conductor was Stephen Darlington. Two versions are used over the opening credits: one with a full choir and one with a solo. Goodall originally wrote it as a serious piece of church choral music. It has been released as a charity single, with proceeds going to Comic Relief. It also appears on Goodall&#x27;s CD &quot;Choral Works&quot;, which additionally includes his theme for &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, another popular comedy co-created by Richard Curtis. A snippet of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;&#x27;s theme music was used in the &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; episode &quot;Tee Off, Mr. Bean&quot; and the music from &quot;Mr Bean&quot; plays during Sean Bean&#x27;s cameo in &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; episode &quot;Spring&quot;.

==Awards and accolades==

The series also won the TV Choice Award for Best Comedy in 2005 and again in 2021 for the Lockdown Specials.

In May 2007, Richard Curtis received a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award for his humanitarian pursuits, as well as his creative work, including &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; was released on DVD in Region 2 (UK) in 2001. In 2002, a DVD entitled &quot;The Best of The Vicar of Dibley&quot; was released featuring a 90-minute film of Dawn French talking to the producer, Jon Plowman, with clips from the series. A 2002 documentary narrated by Jo Brand, entitled &quot;The Real Vicars of Dibley&quot;, was also on the DVD. In 2005, a &quot;complete collection&quot; box set was released. This included all the then-aired episodes. The final two episodes and a 6-disc &quot;ultimate&quot; box set were released on 26 November 2007.

In Australasia (Region 4), all episodes have been released on DVD.

All episodes have been released on DVD in the United States and Canada (Region 1).

==Legacy==
===Adaptations===
On 6 February 2007, Fox announced plans to adapt &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; into an American sitcom titled &quot;The Minister of Divine&quot;. The series starred Kirstie Alley as a former &quot;wild child&quot; who returned to her hometown as its first female minister. The pilot was broadcast on Fox, but the series was not made.

The series has also been adapted into two stage plays by Ian Gower and Paul Carpenter, both incorporating plots from the TV episodes. The first is titled &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, and is concerned mainly with Alice and Hugo&#x27;s engagement and wedding. The second, &quot;A Vicar of Dibley Christmas – The Second Coming&quot;, is based on the episodes &quot;Dibley Live&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;, in which the villagers set up a radio station and put on a nativity play at Owen&#x27;s farm. A third adaptation by Steve Clark and David Lovesy, titled &quot;The Vicar of Dibley - The Holy Trinity&quot;, covers Baby Geraldine’s Christening, David Horton&#x27;s brief wooing of Geraldine, and the Save Our Dibley campaign as a new reservoir threatens the village. Performance rights for all three are available through United Agents.

===Possible return===
In February 2016, it was reported that Dawn French was interested in returning to the role in a new series, &quot;The Bishop of Dibley&quot;, to follow on from the 2015 Red Nose Day Special. In December 2020, French opened up about the prospect of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; returning for a new series in 2021.

===&quot;Comedy Classic: Vicar of Dibley&quot;===
In December 2022, Channel 5 aired a 67-minute special retrospective for their &quot;Comedy Classics&quot; series. Actors and celebrities, including co-writer Paul Mayhew-Archer, take a look back, discuss and pay tribute to the show.

<text>An emoji ( ; plural emoji or emojis; , ) is a pictogram, logogram, ideogram, or smiley embedded in text and used in electronic messages and web pages. The primary function of modern emoji is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation as well as to replace words as part of a logographic system. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, expressions, activity, food and drinks, celebrations, flags, objects, symbols, places, types of weather, animals, and nature. 

Originally meaning pictograph, the word &quot;emoji&quot; comes from Japanese  + ; the resemblance to the English words &quot;emotion&quot; and &quot;emoticon&quot; is purely coincidental. The first emoji sets were created by Japanese portable electronic device companies in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Emoji became increasingly popular worldwide in the 2010s after Unicode began encoding emoji into the Unicode Standard. They are now considered to be a large part of popular culture in the West and around the world. In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named the Face with Tears of Joy emoji (😂) the word of the year.

==History==

===Evolution from emoticons (1990s)===
The emoji was predated by the emoticon, a concept implemented in 1982 by computer scientist Scott Fahlman when he suggested text-based symbols such as :-) and :-( could be used to replace language. Theories about language replacement can be traced back to the 1960s, when Russian novelist and professor Vladimir Nabokov stated in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile — some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket.&quot; It did not become a mainstream concept until the 1990s, when Japanese, American, and European companies began developing Fahlman&#x27;s idea. Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope point out that similar symbology was incorporated by Bruce Parello, a student at the University of Illinois, into PLATO IV, the first e-learning system, in 1972. The PLATO system was not considered mainstream, and therefore Parello&#x27;s pictograms were only used by a small number of people. Scott Fahlman&#x27;s emoticons importantly used common alphabet symbols and aimed to replace language/text to express emotion, and for that reason are seen as the actual origin of emoticons.

The first emoji are a matter of contention due to differing definitions and poor early documentation. It was previously widely considered that DoCoMo had the first emoji set in 1999, but an Emojipedia blog article in 2019 brought SoftBank&#x27;s earlier 1997 set to light. More recently, in 2024, earlier emoji sets were uncovered on portable devices by Sharp Corporation and NEC in the early 1990s, with the 1988 Sharp PA-8500 harboring what can be defined as the earliest known emoji set that reflects emoji keyboards today.
Wingdings, a font invented by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes, was released by Microsoft in 1990. It could be used to send pictographs in rich text messages, but would only load on devices with the Wingdings font installed. In 1995, the French newspaper announced that Alcatel would be launching a new phone, the BC 600. Its welcome screen displayed a digital smiley face, replacing the usual text seen as part of the &quot;welcome message&quot; often seen on other devices at the time. In 1997, SoftBank&#x27;s J-Phone arm launched the SkyWalker DP-211SW, which contained a set of 90 emoji. Its designs, each measuring 12 by 12 pixels, were monochrome, depicting numbers, sports, the time, moon phases, and the weather. It contained the Pile of Poo emoji in particular. The J-Phone model experienced low sales, and the emoji set was thus rarely used.

In 1999, Shigetaka Kurita created 176 emoji as part of NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode, used on its mobile platform. They were intended to help facilitate electronic communication and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services. Due to their influence, Kurita&#x27;s designs were once claimed to be the first cellular emoji; however, Kurita has denied that this is the case. According to interviews, he took inspiration from Japanese manga where characters are often drawn with symbolic representations called &quot;manpu&quot; (such as a water drop on a face representing nervousness or confusion), and weather pictograms used to depict the weather conditions at any given time. He also drew inspiration from Chinese characters and street sign pictograms. The DoCoMo i-Mode set included facial expressions, such as smiley faces, derived from a Japanese visual style commonly found in manga and anime, combined with &quot;kaomoji&quot; and smiley elements. Kurita&#x27;s work is displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

Kurita&#x27;s emoji were brightly colored, albeit with a single color per glyph. General-use emoji, such as sports, actions, and weather, can readily be traced back to Kurita&#x27;s emoji set. Notably absent from the set were pictograms that demonstrated emotion. The yellow-faced emoji in current use evolved from other emoticon sets and cannot be traced back to Kurita&#x27;s work. His set also had generic images much like the J-Phones. Elsewhere in the 1990s, Nokia phones began including preset pictograms in its text messaging app, which they defined as &quot;smileys and symbols&quot;. A third notable emoji set was introduced by Japanese mobile phone brand au by KDDI.

===Development of emoji sets (2000–2007)===
The basic 12-by-12-pixel emoji in Japan grew in popularity across various platforms over the next decade. While emoji adoption was high in Japan during this time, the competitors failed to collaborate to create a uniform set of emoji to be used across all platforms in the country.
The Universal Coded Character Set (Unicode), controlled by the Unicode Consortium and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2, had already been established as the international standard for text representation (ISO/IEC 10646) since 1993, although variants of Shift JIS remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from North American or Western European sources such as DOS code page 437, ITC Zapf Dingbats, or the WordPerfect Iconic Symbols set. Unicode coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets (deemed out of scope), although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added. For example, Unicode 4.0 contained 16 new emoji, which included direction arrows, a warning triangle, and an eject button. Besides Zapf Dingbats, other dingbat fonts such as Wingdings or Webdings also included additional pictographic symbols in their own custom pi font encodings; unlike Zapf Dingbats, however, many of these would not be available as Unicode emoji until 2014.

Nicolas Loufrani applied to the US Copyright Office in 1999 to register the 471 smileys that he created. Soon after he created The Smiley Dictionary, which not only hosted the largest number of smileys at the time, it also categorized them. The desktop platform was aimed at allowing people to insert smileys as text when sending emails and writing on a desktop computer. By 2003, it had grown to 887 smileys and 640 ascii emotions.

The smiley toolbar offered a variety of symbols and smileys and was used on platforms such as MSN Messenger. Nokia, then one of the largest global telecom companies, was still referring to today&#x27;s emoji sets as smileys in 2001. The digital smiley movement was headed up by Nicolas Loufrani, the CEO of The Smiley Company. He created a smiley toolbar, which was available at smileydictionary.com during the early 2000s to be sent as emoji. Over the next two years, The Smiley Dictionary became the plug-in of choice for forums and online instant messaging platforms. There were competitors, but The Smiley Dictionary was the most popular. Platforms such as MSN Messenger allowed for customisation from 2001 onwards, with many users importing emoticons to use in messages as text. These emoticons would eventually go on to become the modern-day emoji. It was not until MSN Messenger and BlackBerry noticed the popularity of these unofficial sets and launched their own from late 2003 onwards.

===Beginnings of Unicode emoji (2007–2014)===

The first American company to take notice of emoji was Google beginning in 2007. In August 2007, a team made up of Mark Davis and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer began petitioning the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) in an attempt to standardise the emoji. The UTC, having previously deemed emoji to be out of scope for Unicode, made the decision to broaden its scope to enable compatibility with the Japanese cellular carrier formats which were becoming more widespread. Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative effort from Apple Inc. shortly after, and their official UTC proposal came in January 2009 with 625 new emoji characters. Unicode accepted the proposal in 2010.

Pending the assignment of standard Unicode code points, Google and Apple implemented emoji support via Private Use Area schemes. Google first introduced emoji in Gmail in October 2008, in collaboration with au by KDDI, and Apple introduced the first release of Apple Color Emoji to iPhone OS on 21 November 2008. Initially, Apple&#x27;s emoji support was implemented for holders of a SoftBank SIM card; the emoji themselves were represented using SoftBank&#x27;s Private Use Area scheme and mostly resembled the SoftBank designs. Gmail emoji used their own Private Use Area scheme in a supplementary Private Use plane.

Separately, a proposal had been submitted in 2008 to add the ARIB extended characters used in broadcasting in Japan to Unicode. This included several pictographic symbols. These were added in Unicode 5.2 in 2009, a year before the cellular emoji sets were fully added; they include several characters which either also appeared amongst the cellular emoji or were subsequently classified as emoji.

After iPhone users in the United States discovered that downloading Japanese apps allowed access to the keyboard, pressure grew to expand the availability of the emoji keyboard beyond Japan. The Emoji application for iOS, which altered the Settings app to allow access to the emoji keyboard, was created by Josh Gare in February 2010. Before the existence of Gare&#x27;s Emoji app, Apple had intended for the emoji keyboard to only be available in Japan in iOS version 2.2.

Throughout 2009, members of the Unicode Consortium and national standardization bodies of various countries gave feedback and proposed changes to the international standardization of the emoji. The feedback from various bodies in the United States, Europe, and Japan agreed on a set of 722 emoji as the standard set. This would be released in October 2010 in Unicode 6.0. Apple made the emoji keyboard available to those outside of Japan in iOS version 5.0 in 2011. Later, Unicode 7.0 (June 2014) added the character repertoires of the Webdings and Wingdings fonts to Unicode, resulting in approximately 250 more Unicode emoji.

The Unicode emoji whose code points were assigned in 2014 or earlier are therefore taken from several sources. A single character could exist in multiple sources, and characters from a source were unified with existing characters where appropriate: for example, the &quot;shower&quot; weather symbol (☔️) from the ARIB source was unified with an existing umbrella with raindrops character, which had been added for KPS 9566 compatibility. The emoji characters named from all three Japanese carriers were in turn unified with the ARIB character. However, the Unicode Consortium groups the most significant sources of emoji into four categories:

===UTS #51 and modern emoji (2015–present)===
In late 2014, a Public Review Issue was created by the Unicode Technical Committee, seeking feedback on a proposed Unicode Technical Report (UTR) titled &quot;Unicode Emoji&quot;. This was intended to improve interoperability of emoji between vendors, and define a means of supporting multiple skin tones. The feedback period closed in January 2015. Also in January 2015, the use of the zero-width joiner to indicate that a sequence of emoji could be shown as a single equivalent glyph (analogous to a ligature) as a means of implementing emoji without atomic code points, such as varied compositions of families, was discussed within the &quot;emoji ad-hoc committee&quot;.

Unicode 8.0 (June 2015) added another 41 emoji, including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat, food items such as the taco, new facial expressions, and symbols for places of worship, as well as five characters (crab, scorpion, lion face, bow and arrow, amphora) to improve support for pictorial rather than symbolic representations of the signs of the Zodiac.

Also in June 2015, the first approved version (&quot;Emoji 1.0&quot;) of the Unicode Emoji report was published as Unicode Technical Report #51 (UTR #51). This introduced the mechanism of skin tone indicators, the first official recommendations about which Unicode characters were to be considered emoji, and the first official recommendations about which characters were to be displayed in an emoji font in the absence of a variation selector, and listed the zero-width joiner sequences for families and couples that were implemented by existing vendors. Maintenance of UTR #51, taking emoji requests, and creating proposals for emoji characters and emoji mechanisms was made the responsibility of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee (ESC), operating as a subcommittee of the Unicode Technical Committee.

With the release of version 5.0 in May 2017 alongside Unicode 10.0, UTR #51 was redesignated a Unicode Technical Standard (UTS #51), making it an independent specification. there were 2,666 Unicode emoji listed. The next version of UTS #51 (published in May 2018) skipped to the version number Emoji 11.0 so as to synchronise its major version number with the corresponding version of the Unicode Standard.
The popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures. Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre-Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan, including Yahoo and MSN Messenger. Corporate demand for emoji standardization has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium, with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group&#x27;s traditional focus on standardizing characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records. Conversely, the Consortium thought that public desire for emoji support has put pressure on vendors to improve their Unicode support, which is especially true for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, thus leading to better support for Unicode&#x27;s historic and minority scripts in deployed software.

In 2022, the Unicode Consortium decided to stop accepting proposals for flag emoji, citing low use of the category and that adding new flags &quot;creates exclusivity at the expense of others&quot;. The Consortium stated that new flag emoji would still be added when their country becomes part of the ISO 3166-1 standard, with no proposal needed.

===Cultural influence===
Oxford Dictionaries named its 2015 Word of the Year. Oxford noted that 2015 had seen a sizable increase in the use of the word &quot;emoji&quot; and recognized its impact on popular culture. Oxford Dictionaries President Caspar Grathwohl expressed that &quot;traditional alphabet scripts have been struggling to meet the rapid-fire, visually focused demands of 21st Century communication. It&#x27;s not surprising that a pictographic script like emoji has stepped in to fill those gaps — it&#x27;s flexible, immediate, and infuses tone beautifully.&quot; SwiftKey found that &quot;Face with Tears of Joy&quot; was the most popular emoji across the world. The American Dialect Society declared to be the &quot;Most Notable Emoji&quot; of 2015 in their Word of the Year vote.

Some emoji are specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing businessman (), the shoshinsha mark used to indicate a beginner driver (), a white flower () used to denote &quot;brilliant homework&quot;, or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles (), dango (), onigiri (), curry (), and sushi (). Unicode Consortium founder Mark Davis compared the use of emoji to a developing language, particularly mentioning the American use of eggplant () to represent a phallus. Some linguists have classified emoji and emoticons as discourse markers.

In December 2015, a sentiment analysis of emoji was published, and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking 1.0 was provided. In 2016, a musical about emoji premiered in Los Angeles. The animated &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; was released in summer 2017.

In January 2017, in what is believed to be the first large-scale study of emoji usage, researchers at the University of Michigan analyzed over 1.2 billion messages input via the Kika Emoji Keyboard and announced that the Face With Tears of Joy was the most popular emoji. The Heart and the Heart eyes emoji stood second and third, respectively. The study also found that the French use heart emoji the most. People in countries like Australia, France, and the Czech Republic used more happy emoji, while this was not so for people in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina, where people used more negative emoji in comparison to cultural hubs known for restraint and self-discipline, like Turkey, France, and Russia.

There has been discussion among legal experts on whether or not emoji could be admissible as evidence in court trials. Furthermore, as emoji continue to develop and grow as a &quot;language&quot; of symbols, there may also be the potential of the formation of emoji &quot;dialects&quot;. Emoji are being used as more than just to show reactions and emotions. Snapchat has even incorporated emoji in its trophy and friends system with each emoji showing a complex meaning. Emoji can also convey different meanings based on syntax and inversion. For instance, &#x27;fairy comments&#x27; involve heart, star, and fairy emoji placed between the words of a sentence. These comments often invert the meanings associated with hearts and may be used to &#x27;tread on borders of offense.&#x27;
In 2017, the MIT Media Lab published DeepMoji, a deep neural network sentiment analysis algorithm that was trained on 1.2 billion emoji occurrences in Twitter data from 2013 to 2017. DeepMoji was found to outperform human subjects in correctly identifying sarcasm in Tweets and other online modes of communication.

====Use in furthering causes====

On March 5, 2019, a drop of blood () emoji was released, which is intended to help break the stigma of menstruation. In addition to normalizing periods, it will also be relevant to describe medical topics such as donating blood and other blood-related activities.

A mosquito () emoji was added in 2018 to raise awareness for diseases spread by the insect, such as dengue and malaria.

== Linguistic function of emoji ==
Linguistically, emoji are used to indicate emotional state; they tend to be used more in positive communication. Some researchers believe emoji can be used for visual rhetoric. Emoji can be used to set emotional tone in messages. Emoji tend not to have their own meaning but act as a paralanguage, adding meaning to text. Emoji can add clarity and credibility to text.

Sociolinguistically, the use of emoji differs depending on speaker and setting. Women use emoji more than men. Men use a wider variety of emoji. Women are more likely to use emoji in public communication than in private communication. Extraversion and agreeableness are positively correlated with emoji use; neuroticism is negatively correlated. Emoji use differs between cultures: studies in terms of Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions theory found that cultures with high power distance and tolerance to indulgence used more negative emoji, while those with high uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and long-term orientation use more positive emoji. A 6-country user experience study showed that emoji-based scales (specifically the usage of smileys) may ease the challenges related to translation and implementation for brief cross-cultural surveys.

As emoji act as a paralanguage this causes a unique pattern to be seen in the bigrams, trigrams, and quadrigrams of emoji. A study conducted by Gretchen McCulloch and Lauren Gawne showed that the most common bigrams, trigrams, and quadrigrams of emoji are those that repeat the same emoji. Unlike other languages emoji frequently are repeated one after another, while in languages, such as English, it is rare to see words repeated after one another. An example of this is that a common bigram for emoji is two crying laughing emoji. Rather than being a repeated word or phrase the use of emoji after one another typically represents an emphasize of the displayed emoji&#x27;s meaning instead. So, one crying laughing emoji means something is funny, two represent it&#x27;s really funny, three might represent it&#x27;s incredibly funny, and so forth.

==Emoji communication problems==
Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer; in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.

The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver. For example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and obnoxious attitude, as the orbicularis oculi (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the orbicularis oris (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.

The second problem relates to encodes. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader&#x27;s device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. As an example, in April 2020, British actress and presenter Jameela Jamil posted a tweet from her iPhone using the Face with Hand Over Mouth emoji (🤭) as part of a comment on people shopping for food during the COVID-19 pandemic. On Apple&#x27;s iOS, the emoji expression was neutral and pensive, but on other platforms the emoji shows as a giggling face. Some fans thought that she was mocking poor people, but this was not her intended meaning.

Researchers from the German Studies Institute at Ruhr-Universität Bochum found that most people can easily understand an emoji when it replaces a word directly – like an icon for a rose instead of the word &#x27;rose&#x27; – yet it takes people about 50 percent longer to comprehend the emoji.

===Variation and ambiguity===
Emoji characters vary slightly between platforms within the limits in meaning defined by the Unicode specification, as companies have tried to provide artistic presentations of ideas and objects. For example, following an Apple tradition, the calendar emoji on Apple products always shows July 17, the date in 2002 Apple announced its iCal calendar application for macOS. This led some Apple product users to initially nickname July 17 &quot;World Emoji Day&quot;. Other emoji fonts show different dates or do not show a specific one.

Some Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard, since SoftBank was the first Japanese network on which the iPhone launched. For example, is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender-neutral on others.

Journalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture-specific meanings not present in the original glyphs. For example, has been described as being used in English-language communities to signify &quot;non-caring fabulousness&quot; and &quot;anything from shutting down to a sense of accomplishment&quot;. Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used, for example noting that some users may expect to stand for &quot;a reserved or ticketed seat, as for an airplane, train, or theater&quot;.

===Controversial emoji===

Some emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings. Multiple arrests and imprisonments have followed the usage of pistol (), knife (), and bomb () emoji in ways that authorities deemed credible threats.

In the lead-up to the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Unicode Consortium considered proposals to add several Olympic-related emoji, including medals and events such as handball and water polo. By October 2015, these candidate emoji included &quot;rifle&quot; () and &quot;modern pentathlon&quot; (). However, in 2016, Apple and Microsoft opposed these two emoji, and the characters were added without emoji presentations, meaning that software is expected to render them in black-and-white rather than color, and emoji-specific software such as onscreen keyboards will generally not include them. In addition, while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events, including a man pointing a gun, the final glyph contains a person riding a horse, along with a laser pistol target in the corner.
On August 1, 2016, Apple announced that in iOS 10, the pistol emoji () would be changed from a realistic revolver to a water pistol. Conversely, the following day, Microsoft pushed out an update to Windows 10 that changed its longstanding depiction of the pistol emoji as a toy raygun to a real revolver. Microsoft stated that the change was made to bring the glyph more in line with industry-standard designs and customer expectations. By 2018, most major platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Facebook, and Twitter had transitioned their rendering of the pistol emoji to match Apple&#x27;s water gun implementation. Apple&#x27;s change of depiction from a realistic gun to a toy gun was criticised by, among others, the editor of Emojipedia, because it could lead to messages appearing differently to the receiver than the sender had intended. &quot;Insider&quot; Rob Price said it created the potential for &quot;serious miscommunication across different platforms&quot;, and asked, &quot;What if a joke sent from an Apple user to a Google user is misconstrued because of differences in rendering? Or if a genuine threat sent by a Google user to an Apple user goes unreported because it is taken as a joke?&quot;

The eggplant (aubergine) emoji () has also seen controversy due to it being used to represent a penis. Beginning in December 2014, the hashtag began to rise to popularity on Instagram for use in marking photos featuring clothed or unclothed penises. This became such a popular trend that, beginning in April 2015, Instagram disabled the ability to search for not only the tag, but also other eggplant-containing hashtags, including simply and .

The peach emoji () has likewise been used as a euphemistic icon for buttocks, with a 2016 Emojipedia analysis revealing that only seven percent of English language tweets with the peach emoji refer to the actual fruit. In 2016, Apple attempted to redesign the emoji to less resemble buttocks. This was met with fierce backlash in beta testing, and Apple reversed its decision by the time it went live to the public.

In December 2017, a lawyer in Delhi, India, threatened to file a lawsuit against WhatsApp for allowing use of the middle finger emoji () on the basis that the company is &quot;directly abetting the use of an offensive, lewd, obscene gesture&quot; in violation of the Indian Penal Code.

==Emoji implementation==
===Early implementation in Japan===
Various, often incompatible, character encoding schemes were developed by the different mobile providers in Japan for their own emoji sets. For example, the extended Shift JIS representation F797 is used for a convenience store (🏪) by SoftBank, but for a wristwatch (⌚️) by KDDI. All three vendors also developed schemes for encoding their emoji in the Unicode Private Use Area: DoCoMo, for example, used the range U+E63E through U+E757. Versions of iOS prior to 5.1 encoded emoji in the SoftBank private use area.
===Unicode support considerations===
Most, but not all, emoji are included in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP) of Unicode, which is also used for ancient scripts, some modern scripts such as Adlam or Osage, and special-use characters such as Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols. Some systems introduced prior to the advent of Unicode emoji were only designed to support characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) on the assumption that non-BMP characters would rarely be encountered, although failure to properly handle characters outside of the BMP precludes Unicode compliance.

The introduction of Unicode emoji created an incentive for vendors to improve their support for non-BMP characters. The Unicode Consortium notes that &quot;[b]ecause of the demand for emoji, many implementations have upgraded their Unicode support substantially&quot;, also helping support minority languages that use those features.

===Color support===
Any operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji-supporting font. However, inclusion of colorful emoji in existing font formats requires dedicated support for color glyphs. Not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so, emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. There are four different formats used for multi-color glyphs in an SFNT font, not all of which are necessarily supported by a given operating system library or software package such as a web browser or graphical program.

===Implementation by different platforms and vendors===
Apple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of OS X 10.7 Lion, in 2011. Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications, which are commonly shared by mobile users, as well as any other application. Users can create emoji symbols using the &quot;Characters&quot; special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the &quot;Edit&quot; menu and pulling down to &quot;Special Characters&quot;, or by the key combination . The emoji keyboard was first available in Japan with the release of iPhone OS version 2.2 in 2008. The emoji keyboard was not officially made available outside of Japan until iOS version 5.0. From iPhone OS 2.2 through to iOS 4.3.5 (2011), those outside Japan could access the keyboard but had to use a third-party app to enable it. Apple has revealed that the &quot;face with tears of joy&quot; is the most popular emoji among English-speaking Americans. On second place is the &quot;heart&quot; emoji, followed by the &quot;Loudly Crying Face&quot;.

An update for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems as part of the &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot; font. As of Windows 8.1 Preview, the &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; font is included, which supplies full-color pictographs. The plain Segoe UI font lacks emoji characters, whereas Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them. Emoji characters can be accessed through the onscreen keyboard&#x27;s key or through the physical keyboard shortcut .

In 2016, Firefox 50 added in-browser emoji rendering for platforms lacking in native support.

Facebook and Twitter replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics. Prior to October 2017, Facebook had different sets for the main site and for its Messenger service, where only the former provides complete coverage. Messenger now uses Apple emoji on iOS, and the main Facebook set elsewhere. Facebook reactions are only partially compatible with standard emoji.

==Modifiers==
===Emoji versus text presentation===
Unicode defines variation sequences for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation.
Specifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style. As of version (2024), Unicode defines presentation sequences for 371 characters. However, the Unicode Technical Committee has since determined that unifying colourful emoji characters with textual symbols and dingbats was a &quot;mistake&quot;, and resolved to allocate new code points rather than defining new presentation sequences.

===Skin color===
Five symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode 8.0 to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji. These modifiers are called &quot;EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-1-2&quot;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; (U+1F3FB–U+1F3FF): . They are based on the Fitzpatrick scale for classifying human skin color. Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic, non-realistic skin tone, such as bright yellow (■), blue (■), or gray (■). Non-human emoji (like ) are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers. , Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with 131 human emoji spread across seven blocks: Dingbats, Emoticons, Miscellaneous Symbols, Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs, Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A, and Transport and Map Symbols.

The following table shows both the Unicode characters and the open-source &quot;Twemoji&quot; images, designed by Twitter:

===Joining===

Implementations may use a zero-width joiner (ZWJ) between multiple emoji to make them behave like a single, unique emoji character. For example, the sequence , , , , (👨‍👩‍👧) could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man, a woman, and a girl if the implementation supports it. Systems that do not support it would ignore the ZWJs, displaying only the three base emoji in order (👨👩👧).

Unicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that were supported on at least one commonly available platform. The consortium has since switched to documenting sequences that are &quot;recommended for general interchange&quot; (RGI). These are clusters that emoji fonts are expected to include as part of the standard.

The ZWJ has also been used to implement platform-specific emoji. For example, in 2016, Microsoft released a series of Ninja Cat emoji for their Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The sequence , , was used to create Ninja Cat (🐱‍👤). Ninja Cat and variants were removed in late 2021&#x27;s &quot;Fluent&quot; emoji redesign.

==In Unicode==

Unicode specifies a total of 3,790 emoji using 1,431 characters spread across 24 blocks, of which 26 are Regional indicator symbols that combine in pairs to form flag emoji, and 12 (#, * and 0–9) are base characters for keycap emoji sequences.

33 of the 192 code points in the Dingbats block are considered emoji.
All of the 80 code points in the Emoticons block are considered emoji.
83 of the 256 code points in the Miscellaneous Symbols block are considered emoji.
637 of the 768 code points in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block are considered emoji.
242 of the 256 code points in the Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs block are considered emoji.
All of the 114 code points in the Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A block are considered emoji.
105 of the 118 code points in the Transport and Map Symbols block are considered emoji.

Additional emoji can be found in the following Unicode blocks:
Arrows (8 code points considered emoji),
Basic Latin (12),
CJK Symbols and Punctuation (2),
Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement (41),
Enclosed Alphanumerics (1),
Enclosed CJK Letters and Months (2),
Enclosed Ideographic Supplement (15),
General Punctuation (2),
Geometric Shapes (8),
Geometric Shapes Extended (13),
Latin-1 Supplement (2),
Letterlike Symbols (2),
Mahjong Tiles (1),
Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows (7),
Miscellaneous Technical (18),
Playing Cards (1), and
Supplemental Arrows-B (2).

<text>USS &quot;Hopper&quot; (DDG-70) is twentieth &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy, named for the pioneering computer scientist Rear Admiral Grace Hopper.

&quot;Hopper&quot; is only the second US Navy warship to be named for a woman from the Navy&#x27;s own ranks. This ship is the 20th destroyer of her class. &quot;Hopper&quot; was the 11th ship of this class to be built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, and construction began on 23 February 1995. She was launched and christened on 6 January 1996. On 6 September 1997, she was commissioned in San Francisco. 

==Service history==
===Deployments===
&quot;Hopper&quot; has participated in multiple deployments to East Asia and the Persian Gulf, including RIMPAC 98, three individual PACMEF deployments, an Expeditionary Strike Group deployment to the Persian Gulf in 2004, and a deployment to Southeast Asia in support of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2006. In addition, &quot;Hopper&quot; has been foremost in the field of Ballistic Missile Defense.

On 1 April 2002, &quot;Hopper&quot; departed for a six-month deployment to the North Persian Gulf.

On 12 November 2007, &quot;Hopper&quot; departed with the Expeditionary Strike Group for a scheduled deployment to the Fifth Fleet and Seventh Fleet.

On 6 January 2008, &quot;Hopper&quot; was involved in an incident with five gunboats of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. &quot;Hopper&quot;, along with , a guided missile cruiser, and , a guided missile frigate, were entering the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz when the five Iranian boats approached them at high speed and in a threatening manner. The US Navy ships had been in the Arabian Sea searching for a sailor who had been missing from &quot;Hopper&quot; for 24 hours. The US Navy said the Iranian boats made &quot;threatening&quot; moves toward the US Navy vessels, coming as close as . The US Navy received a radio transmission saying, &quot;I am coming to you. You will explode after a few minutes.&quot; As the US Navy ships prepared to fire, the Iranians abruptly turned away, the US officials said. Before leaving, the Iranians dropped white boxes into the water in front of the US Navy ships. The US Navy ships did not investigate the boxes.

Officials from the two nations differed on the severity of the incident. The Iranians claimed they were conducting normal maneuvers while American officials claimed that an imminent danger to American naval vessels existed.

On 15 April 2011, &quot;Hopper&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor on a deployment to Asia and the Middle East.

On 22 June 2014, &quot;Hopper&quot;, with her Aegis Combat System, detected and tracked a test missile launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll using her onboard AN/SPY-1 radar, providing critical targeting data to a long-range ground-based interceptor (GBI) launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. GBI&#x27;s protect the US from limited long-range ballistic missile attack.

In January 2018, &quot;Hopper&quot; performed a freedom of navigation cruise, sailing within 12 nautical miles of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. China, which has held the rocky outpost since seizing it from the Philippines in 2012, registered a protest on the grounds that the US Navy should have notified China in advance of its approach and had &quot;violated China&#x27;s sovereignty and security interests&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield has a background of blue. In the center is a gold lion with red talons.&quot;

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of a lozenge with a silver star above the trident. Surrounding the lozenge is a wreath with lightning bolts stemming from the bottom. The crest is completed by the blue and gold framing.&quot;

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of white with red trim.&quot;The ships motto is &quot;AUDE ET EFFICE&quot; which can be translated to &quot;DARE AND DO&quot; within context of a command.

=== Seal ===
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS HOPPER&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 70&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

<doc id="513853" wikidata="Q6714458" url="?curid=513853" title="MARC Train">
<text>The Maryland Area Rail Commuter (MARC) is a commuter rail system in the Washington–Baltimore area. MARC is administered by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) and operated under contract by Alstom and Amtrak on track owned by CSX Transportation (CSXT) and Amtrak. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , less than pre-COVID-19 pandemic weekday ridership of 40,000.

With trains on the Penn Line reaching a maximum speed of , MARC has the highest top speed of any commuter railroad in the United States.

== Operations ==
MARC has three lines that radiate from Union Station in Washington, D.C.:
* Penn Line – 58 weekday trains
* Camden Line – 21 weekday trains
* Brunswick Line – 18 weekday trains
The Penn Line is the only line with weekend service, having 18 trains on Saturdays and 12 on Sundays. Service is reduced or suspended on certain federal holidays.

All MARC trains operate in push-pull mode. The cab car is typically on the end of the train closest to Washington; on trains with diesel locomotives, this arrangement keeps exhaust further away from Union Station&#x27;s terminal. Train lengths vary from the 3–5 cars to 10 cars on Penn Line rush hour trains. Shorter trains typically consist of all single level or all bilevel passenger cars while longer trains may have a combination.

The MTA contracts out operations and maintenance of MARC trains to Amtrak for the Penn Line and Alstom for the Brunswick Line and Camden Line.

=== Penn Line ===

The Penn Line is a line that runs along the far southern leg of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Perryville, Maryland, via Baltimore Penn Station. Most trains operate along a stretch between Washington and Baltimore Penn, with limited service to Martin State Airport and Perryville. It is the fastest commuter rail line in North America, with equipment capable of operating at speeds up to . Descended from Washington-Baltimore commuter routes operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, it is by far the busiest MARC line, with almost twice as many trains and twice as many passengers as the other two lines combined. The Penn Line is the only electrified MARC line, and its only line that operates on weekends.

=== Camden Line ===

The Camden Line is a line that runs on CSX-owned tracks between Washington, D.C., and Camden Station in Baltimore. It is descended from B&amp;O commuter routes running between Washington and Baltimore. The B&amp;O began operating over portions of this route in 1830, making it one of the oldest passenger rail lines in the U.S. still in operation.

=== Brunswick Line ===

The Brunswick Line is a line that runs on CSX-owned tracks between Washington, D.C., and Martinsburg, West Virginia, with a branch to Frederick, Maryland. It is descended from Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) commuter service between Washington and its northern and western suburbs.

=== Special Western Maryland service ===
MARC has run special weekend trips to and from Cumberland, Maryland, for Western Maryland residents to attend sporting events in the Washington–Baltimore area, and to facilitate tourist excursions to Western Maryland.

=== Intermodal connections ===
Nearly all stations served by MARC connect with local bus or Metrobus service. Washington Union Station, New Carrollton, College Park, Greenbelt, Silver Spring and Rockville offer connections to the Washington Metro subway, while Baltimore Penn Station and Camden Station both offer connections to the Baltimore Light RailLink. While the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink is not directly connected to the MARC system, its State Center station is not far from Baltimore Penn Station. Washington Union, Baltimore Penn, BWI Airport, Aberdeen, New Carrollton, Rockville, Harpers Ferry, and Martinsburg stations are shared with Amtrak service, and Union Station also offers a connection to the Virginia Railway Express system.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
All three MARC lines date from the 19th century. Service on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) between Baltimore and Ellicott City began on May 24, 1830, over part of what is now the Camden Line. B&amp;O service between Baltimore and Washington, the modern Camden Line route, began on August 25, 1835.

The B&amp;O&#x27;s main line was extended to Frederick Junction (with a branch to ) in 1831, to in 1832, to and in 1834, and in 1842. The B&amp;O completed its Metropolitan Branch in 1873; most service from Martinsburg and Frederick was then diverted onto the Metropolitan Branch to Washington, and the old main line became a secondary route. This established the basic route for what would become the Brunswick Line.

The Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&amp;B) completed its line between Baltimore and Philadelphia in December 1838, save for the ferry across the Susquehanna River, which was not bridged until the 1860s. Although the B&amp;O was chartered with the unspoken assumption that no competing line would be built between Baltimore and Washington, the Pennsylvania Railroad-owned Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&amp;P) was completed between the two cities in 1872. The PW&amp;B was initially hostile to the Pennsylvania (PRR); however, the PRR acquired it in a stock battle with the B&amp;O in 1881. The PW&amp;B soon began operating PRR through servicethe ancestor of Penn Line servicebetween Washington and Philadelphia in conjunction with the B&amp;P. Meanwhile, the PRR ended B&amp;O trackage rights over the PW&amp;B in 1884, forcing it to open its own parallel route in 1886. The PW&amp;B and the B&amp;P were combined into the PRR&#x27;s Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad in 1902.

The B&amp;O ended local service on the Frederick Branch in November 1949. All B&amp;O passenger service between Baltimore and Philadelphia ended in 1958; local service from Washington was curtailed to Camden Station. The B&amp;O continued to offer local service to Brunswick plus long-distance service, while the PRR operated a mix of local, intercity, and long-distance service on the Northeast Corridor. Local service north of Baltimore on the PRR ended around 1964.

=== Public takeover ===
In the mid-20th century, passenger rail service declined owing to a variety of factors, particularly the advent of the automobile, even as commuting between suburban locations and urban business districts remained common. In 1968, the PRR folded into Penn Central, which took over its passenger operations. On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over most intercity passenger service in the United States, including some of Penn Central&#x27;s former routes. The B&amp;O and Penn Central continued to operate their Washington–Baltimore and Washington–Brunswick commuter routes without subsidies.

Amtrak initially operated the Washington–Parkersburg &quot;West Virginian&quot;, later renamed &quot;Potomac Special&quot;. The &quot;Potomac Special&quot; was cut back to a commuter-based Washington–Cumberland trip, the &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, on May 7, 1973. In early 1974, the B&amp;O threatened to discontinue its remaining unsubsidized commuter services, citing heavy losses. On March 1, 1974, the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) began a 50% subsidy of the B&amp;O&#x27;s Washington–Brunswick and Washington–Baltimore servicethe first state-sponsored commuter rail service to Washington. In 1975, the state signed an operating agreement with the B&amp;O, under which the state provided rolling stock and reimbursed the railroad for all operating losses. On October 31, 1976, Amtrak introduced the Washington–Cincinnati &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and cut the &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; to a Washington–Martinsburg trip. In the late 1970s, West Virginia began to fund the B&amp;O shuttles between Brunswick and Martinsburg; the shuttles were soon incorporated as extensions of Brunswick service in order to secure Urban Mass Transportation Administration subsidies. In December 1981, MDOT purchased 22 ex-PRR coaches for use on B&amp;O lines. The Maryland State Railroad Administration (SRA) was established in 1986 to administer contracts, procure rolling stock, and oversee short line railroads in the state.

Conrail took over the unsubsidized ex-PRR Baltimore–Washington service from Penn Central at its creation on April 1, 1976. MDOT began subsidizing that service after Conrail threatened to discontinue service on April 1, 1977. Prior to 1978, most ex-PRR Baltimore–Washington service was operated by aging MP54 electric multiple units, most dating back to the line&#x27;s 1933 electrification. In 1978, Amtrak and the City of Baltimore negotiated with the New Jersey Department of Transportation to lease a number of new Arrow railcars to replace the MP54s. With funding from Pennsylvania and Maryland, Amtrak used some of the cars to initiate a Philadelphia–Washington commuter trip, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, on April 30, 1978. The &quot;Chesapeake&quot; stopped at some local stations but fewer than the Conrail service; it provided commuter service from north of Baltimore for the first time since the 1960s.

BWI Rail Station opened for Amtrak and Conrail trains on October 26, 1980. In August 1982, Conrail trains began stopping at Capital Beltway station, used by intercity trains since 1970. and stations were closed. Two additional round tripsone in the peak direction, and one reverse for commuters working in Baltimorewere added on July 5, 1983. On October 30, 1983, Amtrak and MARC moved from Capital Beltway into a new platform and waiting room at nearby New Carrollton station, which had been served by the Washington Metro since 1978. The Edmondson Avenue and Frederick Road stops in Baltimore were replaced by West Baltimore station on April 30, 1984.

In 1981, MDOT began installing highway signs to point drivers to commuter rail stations. The &quot;Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981&quot; allowed Conrail to shed its commuter rail operations in 1983 in order to focus on its more profitable freight operations. On January 1, 1983, public operators (including Metro-North Railroad, NJ Transit, and SEPTA Regional Rail) took over Conrail commuter rail systems in the Northeast. MDOT began paying Amtrak to run the ex-PRR Washington–Baltimore service. That service was branded as AMDOT (Amtrak Maryland Department of Transportation). In October 1983, with low patronage and largely duplicated by the MDOT-subsidized service, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was discontinued. In 1984, the SRA introduced a unified brand for its three subsidized lines, MARC (originally short for Maryland Rail Commuter, later modified to Maryland Area Rail Commuter). Operations remained the same, but public elements such as schedules and crew uniforms were consolidated under the new name. MARC soon dubbed its three lines the Penn Line, Camden Line, and Brunswick Line.

=== Improved service ===

In October 1986, MARC began testing an Amtrak AEM-7 locomotive, aiming to replace the Arrows with push–pull trains. On February 27, 1989, MARC increased Washington–Baltimore service from 7 to 13 weekday round trips. A new park-and-ride station opened at , while the previous Bowie station was closed. Two more round trips were added in May 1989.

On May 1, 1991, MARC service was extended north from Baltimore to with intermediate stops at , , and . Between 1988 and 1993, MARC expanded service from 34 to 70 total daily trips across the system. In 1995, 800 parking spaces were added to Odenton station.

From 1989 to 1996, the Camden Line had high ridership growth and substantial changes to its stations. A new station at just off Route 32 was opened on July 31, 1989. MARC began service to Greenbelt station on May 3, 1993, seven months before Metro began serving the station. On January 31, 1994, MARC expanded midday service on the Camden and Brunswick lines, opened Laurel Race Track station to relieve a parking shortage at Laurel station, and closed the underused Berwyn station on the Camden Line. On December 12, 1994, Muirkirk station (originally planned as South Laurel) was opened to reduce congestion on nearby Route 1. In 1996, a $1.2 million project added 600 parking spaces at Savage station to relieve crowding. In July 1996, the Elkridge station was closed and replaced with Dorsey station, which has a larger parking area and a dedicated interchange with Route 100.

On April 30, 1987, the B&amp;O was merged into CSX. CSX continued to operate Camden and Brunswick Line service. On July 6, 1987, MARC opened Metropolitan Grove station – the first new station on the Brunswick line in over a century.

=== 1996 Silver Spring collision ===

On February 16, 1996, during the Friday evening rush hour, an eastbound train headed to Washington Union Station via the Brunswick Line collided with the westbound Amtrak &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; headed to Chicago via Pittsburgh. The collision occurred at Georgetown Junction on a snow-swept stretch of track just west of Silver Spring, Maryland. The crash left 11 people dead aboard the MARC train. Three died of injuries suffered in the impact alone, with the rest succumbing to the ensuing smoke and flames or a combination of the two. Engineer Ricky Orr and conductors Jimmy Major Jr. and Jim Quillen were among the victims. Eight Jobs Corps students also were killed during the accident.

The NTSB report concluded that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal aspect of the Kensington color-position signal after making a flag stop at Kensington station. The MARC train was operating in push mode with the cab control car out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover at the time of the collision; the MARC cab control car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, F40PH #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a GE Genesis P40DC #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a human-factors analysis had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.

=== Operations and maintenance contracting controversy ===
In June 2010, the MTA began looking for a new operations and maintenance contractor to replace CSX Transportation for the Camden and Brunswick lines.

Controversy arose when the French-owned and Montgomery County, Maryland-based Keolis, already operating Virginia Railway Express trains, was the only bidder for the contract. The bidding process was suspended in late 2010 due to lack of competition. Before bidding reopened in 2011, Maryland passed a law requiring Keolis&#x27; majority owner, French state railway company SNCF, to fully disclose its role in transporting Jews to concentration camps during World War II, at the request of Leo Bretholz and other Holocaust survivors. This disclosure would need to meet the satisfaction of the Maryland state archivist before Keolis would be allowed to place a bid for MARC service. Keolis faced similar issues while bidding for VRE operations in 2009 before eventually being awarded the contract. Keolis and SNCF lawyers claimed that all documentation required by the law had been produced long before.

In June 2011, the future of Keolis&#x27;s ability to bid on the MARC contract remained up in the air with the new disclosure law in place. No other bidder had emerged to replace CSXT. On June 5, 2011, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran an editorial critical of the disclosure law. The Post claimed that SNCF has been working for years on digitizing its records, and the Maryland law may require items or formats counter to SNCF&#x27;s current system and/or French law. The article also stated that some in the Maryland Attorney General&#x27;s Office worried the law was not Constitutional, may risk retaliation towards Maryland firms overseas, and may risk federal funding for Maryland &quot;by imposing arbitrary procurement demands on a single company&quot;.

MTA issued a new RFP for the operations and maintenance of MARC services on the Brunswick and Camden Lines on July 14, 2011, with a deadline for proposals on November 21, 2011. The terms specified a nearly six-year base contract with a five-year renewal option. On October 17, 2012, the $204 million contract was awarded to the Canadian company Bombardier Transportation, effectively ending the Keolis controversy. The pre-service transition period began on the Thursday of that week, during which time CSXT continued to operate MARC trains. The five-year renewal was exercised in 2018. The contract passed to Alstom in 2021 when they purchased Bombardier. Alstom was awarded a $401 million, five-year contract in April 2023, with two five-year extensions possible.

== Proposals for service expansion ==
=== 2007 plan ===
In the first decade of the 21st century, MARC ridership increased significantly, and the system neared capacity for its current configuration. With the area population growing and the BRAC process poised to bring new jobs to Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Meade, both near MARC stations, the state saw the need to expand service. In September 2007, MTA Maryland unveiled an ambitious 30-year plan of system improvements. Though funding sources had not been established at that time, the plan represented the state&#x27;s goals of increasing capacity and flexibility. Proposed improvements included:

*54 Bombardier MultiLevels were ordered to replace aging single-level cars.
*Weekend service on the Penn Line. Service began on December 7, 2013, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., with some trips extending to Martin State Airport. There are nine round trips on Saturdays (three begin and three then later end at Martin State Airport) and 6 round trips on Sundays (two begin and two then later end at Martin State Airport).
*Increased mid-day service and reverse commute service on the Camden and Brunswick Lines. As of 2015, there is a somewhat limited reverse commute service in effect on the Camden Line.
*Extension of service past Union Station in Washington to L&#x27;Enfant Plaza and to Northern Virginia along VRE routes, thus relieving pressure on the Washington Metro
*More daily trips east of Baltimore&#x27;s Penn Station, including improved service to Aberdeen Proving Ground
*Service beyond Perryville to Newark or Wilmington in Delaware, providing a connection to SEPTA commuter trains to Philadelphia and beyond
*New or expanded tunnels along the Northeast Corridor in Baltimore
*New stations in Baltimore, providing direct connections with the Metro Subway, and service to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Bayview Medical Center
*Rapid transit-like service through Baltimore

Some of the proposals were foreseen to take years or decades to implement, however others such as Penn Line weekend service could have begun in a matter of months, yet budgetary shortfalls prevented this. In Spring 2009, to offset such budget shortfalls, ticket sales employees at most non-Amtrak stations were replaced with Amtrak &quot;Quik-Trak&quot; touchscreen ticket machines, and some train services were eliminated or scaled back. Ticket machines were also added to stations that were not previously staffed, such as . The only remaining staffed stations, Odenton and Frederick, remained staffed by Commuter Direct.

=== 2010s: Initial Extension Proposal to Delaware ===
In 2017, the Wilmington Area Planning Council submitted ridership studies to Cecil County, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, SEPTA and the Delaware Department of Transportation for the extension of MARC service from Perryville to Newark, Delaware, and possibly Wilmington, via Elkton. The section from Perryville to Newark is the one of only three along the Northeast Corridor not covered by commuter train service (the others are between New London, Connecticut, and Wickford Junction, Rhode Island, and between New York Penn Station and New Rochelle, New York). The Route 5 bus operated by Cecil Transit formerly connected the two stations.

=== 2020s: Extension to Delaware and Virginia Agreement ===
On April 13, 2023, MDOT announced an agreement with the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority and the Delaware Transit Corporation for expansion possibilities beyond the current termini of MARC train service. Expansion into Virginia would allow a one seat ride from Maryland to Alexandria, Virginia and to Newark, Delaware, with the latter being initially proposed in 2017 as advocated by Cecil County residents. The extension into Delaware would require further deliberations among regional partners, while the extension into Virginia would require replacing the Long Bridge over the Potomac to safely allow more train capacity, which is slated to be completed by 2030. In the short-term, a plan to allow VRE and MARC passenger tickets to be honored on each system is under consideration.

<text>Vanessa is a feminine given name.

It was invented by the Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift for Esther Vanhomrigh, whom Swift had met in 1708 and whom he tutored. The name was created by taking &quot;Van&quot; from Vanhomrigh&#x27;s last name and adding &quot;Essa&quot;, a pet form of Esther. In 1726, the name Vanessa appeared in print for the first time in &quot;Cadenus and Vanessa&quot;, an autobiographical poem about Swift&#x27;s relationship with Vanhomrigh. Swift had written the poem in 1713, but it was not published until three years after Vanhomrigh died. Vanessa was adopted as the name of a genus of butterfly by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1807.

Vanessa was the 71st most popular name for girls born in the United States in 2007. It has been among the top 200 names for girls in the United States since 1953 and among the top 100 names for girls since 1977. It first appeared among the top 1,000 names for girls in the United States in 1950, when it appeared on the list in 939th place.

In Germany, Vanessa has been among the top 100 names for girls since 1976. The name became more and more popular and was the 7th most popular name for girls in the 1990s. In the following years its popularity dropped and the name is ranked in 42nd place for the decade 2000–2009.

== Notable people with the given name ==
* Vanessa Aleksander (born 1996), Polish actress
* Vanessa Ament (born 1955), American foley artist and author

<doc id="513858" wikidata="Q1744506" url="?curid=513858" title="Mo' Wax">
<text>Mo&#x27; Wax was a British record label founded by James Lavelle in 1992. The label was not co-founded by Tim Goldsworthy, as is often reported. Steve Finan became co-owner shortly after. 

Mo&#x27; Wax came to recognition for being at the forefront of trip hop, turntablism and alternative hip hop during the mid-1990s. The label also released notable records covering techno, drum and bass and electro. Mo&#x27; Wax also helped the graffiti artist Futura 2000 regain popularity, by using his artwork on many of their releases in the 1990s. 

Lavelle signed partial ownership of Mo&#x27; Wax over to A&amp;M Records (now part of the Universal Music Group) in 1996. When their deal expired he signed with Beggars Group, who still own some of the catalogue.

The name derives from &quot;Mo&#x27;Wax Please&quot;, the title of a column James Lavelle wrote in the magazine &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot; and the Oxford club night he ran. This in turn was influenced by the Freddie Roach LP, &quot;Mo&#x27; Greens Please&quot; on Blue Note records.

The original Mo&#x27; Wax logo as used on the early releases was designed by UK graphic designer Ian Swift &quot;Swifty&quot; and the label grew their reputation by featuring artwork contributions from Futura, Robert Del Naja (from Massive Attack), She One, &quot;Req1&quot; and Kostas Seremetis.
Ben Drury and Will Bankhead were the main designers responsible for the art direction and design of the label.

The label also released toys and art prints under their Mo&#x27; Wax Arts (MWA) imprint, and collaborated with artists such as Mark Gonzales, Mike Mills, and Money Mark.

The label shut in 2002 and was celebrated in 2014 with an exhibition titled &quot;Urban Archaeology: 21 years of Mo&#x27; Wax&quot;.

In 2015, Lavelle licensed back the Mo&#x27; Wax label to release Elliott Power&#x27;s &quot;Murmur&quot; single as a limited edition hand stamped 12&quot; vinyl. On 26 February 2016, Elliott Power&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Once Smitten&quot;, was released on Mo&#x27; Wax in collaboration with Marathon Artists. This is the label&#x27;s most recent release.

<doc id="513860" wikidata="Q194113" url="?curid=513860" title="Treaty of San Stefano">
<text>The 1878 Preliminary Treaty of San Stefano (; Peace of San-Stefano, ; Peace treaty of San-Stefano, or ) was a treaty between the Russian and Ottoman empires at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. It was signed at San Stefano, then a village west of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), on by Count Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev and Aleksandr Nelidov on behalf of the Russian Empire and by Foreign Minister Saffet Pasha and Ambassador to Germany Sadullah Bey on behalf of the Ottoman Empire.

According to the official Russian position, by signing the treaty, Russia had never intended anything more than a temporary rough draft, so as to enable a final settlement with the other Great Powers.

The treaty provided for the establishment of an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria following almost 500 years of Ottoman rule in the Bulgarian lands. Bulgarians celebrate the day the treaty was signed, , as Liberation Day. However, the enlarged Bulgaria envisioned by the treaty alarmed neighboring states as well as France and the United Kingdom. As a result, the enlargement was never implemented, being superseded by the Treaty of Berlin following the Congress of the same name that took place three months later.

==Effects==

===On Bulgaria===

The treaty established the autonomous self-governing Principality of Bulgaria, with a Christian government and the right to keep an army. Though still &quot;de jure&quot; tributary to the Ottomans, the Principality &quot;de facto&quot; functioned as an independent nation. Its territory included the plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range (Stara Planina), the region of Sofia, Pirot and Vranje in the Morava valley, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia (Article 6).

Bulgaria would thus have had direct access to the Mediterranean. This carried the potential of Russian ships eventually using Bulgarian Mediterranean ports as naval bases, which the other Great Powers greatly disliked.

A prince elected by the people, approved by the Ottoman Empire, and recognized by the Great Powers was to take the helm of the country (Article 7). A council of Bulgarian noblemen was to draft a constitution (also Article 7). (They produced the Tarnovo Constitution.) Ottoman troops were to withdraw from Bulgaria, while Russian troops would remain for two more years (Article 8).

According to Philip Roeder, the Treaty of San Stefano &quot;transformed&quot; Bulgarian nationalism, turning it from a disunited movement into a united one.

===Montenegro, Serbia, and Romania===
Under the treaty, Montenegro more than doubled its territory, acquiring formerly Ottoman-controlled areas including the cities of Nikšić, Podgorica, and Bar (Article 1), and the Ottoman Empire recognized its independence (Article 2).

Serbia gained the cities of Niš and Leskovac in Moravian Serbia and became independent (Article 3).

Turkey recognized the independence of Romania (Article 5) while the latter gained Northern Dobruja from Russia (to which it was transferred from the Ottoman Empire) and ceded Southern Bessarabia in a forced exchange.

===On Russia and the Ottoman Empire===
In exchange for war reparations, the Sublime Porte ceded Armenian and Georgian territories in the Caucasus to Russia, including Ardahan, Artvin, Batum, Kars, Olti, Beyazit, and Alashkert. Additionally, it ceded Northern Dobruja, which Russia handed to Romania in exchange for Southern Bessarabia (Article 19).

Article 21 allowed the population living in areas conquered by Russia to sell property and immigrate to Turkey. The Treaty of Berlin kept a similar provision. Many Adjarians left Adjara at that time.

===On other regions===
The Vilayet of Bosnia (Bosnia and Herzegovina) was supposed to become an autonomous province (Article 14). Crete, Epirus and Thessaly were to receive a limited form of local self-government (Article 15), while the Ottomans vouched for their earlier-given promises to handle reforms in Armenia in order to protect the Armenians from abuse (Article 16). The Straits—the Bosporus and the Dardanelles—were declared open to all neutral ships in war and peacetime (Article 24).

The Circassians of the newly liberated Balkan territories, who had been settled there in 1864 following the Circassian genocide and had committed several atrocities against the Christian population of the region during the war, were to be expelled. This way, the Circassian minority in Dobruja disappeared.

==Reaction==
The Great Powers, especially British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, were unhappy with this extension of Russian power, and Serbia feared that the establishment of Greater Bulgaria would harm its interests in the former and remaining Ottoman territories. These reasons prompted the Great Powers to obtain a revision of the treaty at the Congress of Berlin, and substitute it with the Treaty of Berlin.

Romania, which had contributed significantly to the Russian victory in the war, was extremely disappointed by the treaty, and the Romanian public perceived some of its stipulations as Russia breaking the Russo-Romanian pre-war treaties that guaranteed the integrity of Romanian territory.

Austria-Hungary was disappointed with the treaty as it failed to expand its influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Albanians, dwelling in provinces controlled by the Ottoman Empire, objected to what they considered a significant loss of their territory to Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro and realized they would have to organize nationally to attract the assistance of foreign powers seeking to neutralize Russia&#x27;s influence in the region. The implications of the treaty led to the formation of the League of Prizren.

In the &quot;Salisbury Circular&quot; of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary Robert Cecil, made clear his and his government&#x27;s objections to the Treaty of San Stefano and the favorable position in which it left Russia.

According to British historian A. J. P. Taylor, writing in 1954: &quot;If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for Beaconsfield [Disraeli] in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878 &#x27;We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.&#x27;&quot;

==Critical re-evaluation of treaty in Bulgaria since the 1990s==
Since 1990, a number of historians, publicists and journalists in Bulgaria have subjected the Treaty of San Stefano and the entire policy of the Russian Empire on the Eastern question in the 19th century to critical re-evaluation and have concluded that the treaty was a &quot;charade&quot; crafted by the long-standing Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Count Nikolay Ignatyev, for the purpose of securing Russian interests in Bulgaria and fomenting lasting anti-Western sentiment in Bulgarian society.

===Russian Empire&#x27;s objectives===
Drawing on the texts of the 1876 Reichstadt Agreement, the 1877 Budapest Convention, various correspondence during the time period and particularly Count Ignatyev&#x27;s own unfiltered thoughts in his diaries, all researchers draw the conclusion that the Russian Empire&#x27;s only ambition was to conquer the Turkish Straits, in continuation of Catherine the Great&#x27;s Greek Plan.

They argue that the &quot;Bulgarian Question&quot; and the liberation of the Bulgarians were used only as a political ruse and a stepping stone to Constantinople. As indicated in Ignatyev&#x27;s Diaries, if the Russian plan had succeeded, Bulgarians would have ultimately been placed under Russian control by either subjecting them to direct Russian or indirect Serbian rule or ruling them as a puppet state.

===Count Ignatyev&#x27;s role in securing Russian imperial policy===
Whereas in traditional Bulgarian and international historiography, Ignatyev is generally presented as a great friend of Bulgaria and an advocate of Bulgarian liberation, his diaires present him rather as a Machiavellian politician completely dedicated to furthering Russian imperialist expansion on the Balkans.

Among other things, Ignatyev is found to have continuously subverted the struggle for an independent Bulgarian Church in the 1860s and the 1870s, the success of which played a crucial role in Bulgarian nation-building. He is further implicated to have advocated for the hanging of the founder of the Bulgarian Internal Revolutionary Organisation (IRO), Vasil Levski, before the Ottoman authorities attempted to make the IRO, which was hostile to any foreign involvement, more amenable to Russian desires.

Indzhev, in particular, notes that by eliminating IRO&#x27;s ideologue and leader, hellbent on liberation &quot;by own means&quot; and maligning the 19th-century Bulgarian bourgeoisie (e.g., Stoyan Chomakov), which favoured gaining autonomy by working together with the Ottoman authorities, Ignatyev&#x27;s work blocked both Bulgaria&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;evolutionary&quot; path of development, which made &quot;liberation by Russia&quot;, the scenario giving Russia direct control over Bulgarian affairs, the only option left.

===April Uprising and consequences===
Between 1855 and 1865, the Ottoman authorities settled 300,000 Crimean Tatar, Circassian and other Muslim Caucasian Muhacir in the Danube Vilayet. While the settlement of Crimean Tatars was largely problem-free, the scarcity of arable land, the sheer scale of Circassian migration and the inability of Ottoman authorities to address problems properly turned the Circassian settlement into a disaster that drove impoverished Circassians to join paramilitary (i.e., bashi-bazouk) units or turn to banditry and crime. The Ottoman inability to restore social order was a direct cause of the Bulgarian April Uprising of 1876, whose bloody suppression generated widespread indignation and condemnation in Europe.

Most Great Powers were still deliberating what action to take and eventually reached agreement to convene the Constantinople Conference in late December 1876, when the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary had already apportioned the Ottoman holdings in Europe for themselves by virtue of the Reichstadt Agreement of 8 July 1876, more than half a year earlier. The agreement was reconfirmed and elaborated further in the Budapest Convention of 15 January 1877.

===Reichstadt and Budapest Treaties===
Both treaties were kept entirely secret and envisaged a Russian war on the Ottoman Empire, with Austria-Hungary pledging neutrality. The Russian Empire, in turn, pledged not to create a large Slavic state but only two independent principalities or two autonomous Ottoman vilayets (the version varies depending on language) north and south of the Balkan Range. In turn, Austria-Hungary was given permission to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina. The treaties also envisaged Romania ceding southern Bessarabia to the Russian Empire, territorial acquisitions for Greece, etc.

All researchers have noted the pronounced similarity of the clauses of the two secret treaties to the provisions of the Berlin Treaty and the stark contrast of the three to the territorial provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano. They infer that the Russian Empire never had any actual intent to implement it.

===Sabotaging Constantinople Conference as casus belli for the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)===
However, in particular, Indzhev, Doychev, Gochev and Yordanov do not draw the line here. After comparing the dates of signing of the Budapest Convention (15 January 1877) and Grand Vizier Midhat Pasha&#x27;s refusal (18 January 1877) to accede to the Great Powers&#x27; proposal at the Constantinople Conference for the creation of two autonomous Bulgarian vilayets and taking into account Ignatyev&#x27;s own memos in his 1875–1878 Diaries, among other things, his allegation that&quot;&quot;The Ottoman Sultan trusts the Russian ambassador fully&quot; (pp. 72–73), the insistence that

&quot;the Bulgarians... should be turned into an obedient tool of Russian policy and into our permanent allies by annihilating any option for them to cross to the enemy side&quot; (pp. 51–53) and that

&quot;the Austrian and Turkish Slavs must be our allies and tools of our policy towards Germany&quot; (pp. 51–53), the warning that

&quot;if the nations that rebelled against the Turks fall under Western rather than our influence, the situation on the Balkans will become far more untenable for Russia than it is now&quot;&quot; (p. 58), etc.and after analysing the Great Power that would benefit most from sabotaging the Constantinople Conference, they conclude that the culprit must be The Russian Empire.

Traditionally, Bulgarian historiograhy, in line with Russian propaganda, has always cast the blame for the failure of the Conference on the go-to villain in modern Bulgarian history: the English. The vilayet autonomy proposal reflected all of the United Kingdom&#x27;s desires by splitting the autonomous territory into two and ensuring extensive international (including English) oversight of vilayet affairs, which would have prevented the autonomous territories from becoming Russian puppets. Thus, the vilayet autonomy proposal of the United Kingdom confirmed the veracity of Russian propaganda.

The inability to subjugate the Bulgarians to its long-term goals and policy and the desire to keep Western influence out of the Balkans are argued to be the very reasons for Russia&#x27;s unwillingness to commit to the proposals of the Conference. A war would have drastically reduced the territory of the future Bulgarian state but also given Russia free rein to dictate Bulgarian affairs. Russia&#x27;s intent to go to war as early as July 1876, as stipulated in the Reichstadt Agreement, is adduced as a further argument that the Constantinople Conference was an obstacle, rather than a solution, to the Bulgarian Crisis for Russia.

Indzhev and Gochev hypothesise that Ignatyev secured the Ottomans&#x27; co-operation by assuring them that any territory they would lose in a potential war would be far smaller than the territory of the two autonomous vilayets, which largely overlapped with the borders of the Bulgarian Exarchate. Indeed, the Principality of Bulgaria created after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) covered less than 40% of the territory of the autonomous vilayets.

In that connection, several of the authors have also noted the unwillingness of the Russian administration to refer to the Bulgarians by their national name and to instead call them &quot;Slavs&quot; and &quot;Orthodox Christians&quot; before the war and the subsequent use of designations such as &quot;Russian-Danubian Province&quot;, &quot;Balkan Province&quot;, &quot;occupation fund&quot; and &quot;occupation&quot; until the terms of the Berlin Treaty defined the organisation of the future Bulgarian Principality and gave the Russian occupation corps explicit deadlines for retreat.

In particular, Indzhev, Doychev and Yordanov have opined that if the Russian troops had not been forced in Berlin to withdraw, they would have never left.

===Myth of San Stefano===
Numerous authors conclude that the carefully crafted myth of San Stefano has caused lasting harm to Bulgarian statehood by making Bulgarians vulnerable to Russian propaganda and depriving them of the ability to exercise judgement at critical junctures in their history.

In particular, Aleksandar Tatsov, Yanko Gochev, Plamen Tzvetkov and Alexander Yordanov have referred to the Balkan Wars in which the false belief of several successive Russophile cabinets that &quot;Russia will help Bulgaria because it did so in San Stefano&quot; essentially made the country&#x27;s entire future dependent on a foreign power that had anathemised the Unification of Bulgaria, invited the Ottoman Sultan to reconquer Eastern Rumelia and organised a coup against the Bulgarian Prince only three decades earlier.

The Bulgarian journalist Ivo Indzhev focuses on the vulnerability of modern Bulgaria to Russian propaganda, including with regard to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, and points out that &quot;the myth of San Stefano&quot; remains to this day the most effective tool for generating pro-Russian and anti-Western sentiment in Bulgarian society. Finally, Tsvetkov bluntly states that unless Bulgarian society overcomes what he refers to as &quot;its San Stefano inferiority complex&quot; and &quot;self-degrading Russophilia&quot;, he is not optimistic about the future of the country.

In that connection, quite notably and despite being unaware of either the Reichstadt and Budapest Treaties or Count Ignatyev&#x27;s Diaries, the Bulgarian statesman and long-standing Prime Minister Stefan Stambolov held similar beliefs as early as the 1880s. He considered the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) to be an attempt by Tsarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into a protectorate and preferred a union with Romania or even a dual Bulgarian-Turkish state to further involvement with Russia.

==In popular culture==

The circumstances leading to the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano are depicted in Boris Akunin&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Turkish Gambit&quot;. Akunin in general sticks to known historical facts, though he attributes some acts to fictional characters such as his recurrent protaginist Erast Fandorin.

<doc id="513876" wikidata="Q808657" url="?curid=513876" title="Baron Redesdale">
<text>Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland, is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was firstly created in 1802 for the lawyer and politician Sir John Mitford (later Freeman-Mitford). The title was created anew in 1902 for the former&#x27;s cousin thrice removed Bertram Freeman-Mitford.

== History ==

The Mitford family is an aristocratic English family, with origins in medieval Northumberland where they held Mitford Castle. Sir John Mitford was Speaker of the House of Commons between 1801 and 1802 and Lord Chancellor of Ireland between 1802 and 1806. His only son, the second Baron, served as Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords from 1851 to 1886. In 1877, he was created Earl of Redesdale, in the County of Northumberland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Redesdale never married, and on his death in 1886 both titles became extinct. The Earl bequeathed his substantial estates to his first cousin twice removed, the diplomat, politician and writer Sir Bertram Mitford, the great-grandson of historian William Mitford, who was the elder brother of the first Baron Redesdale. 

The Redesdale title was revived when Bertram Freeman-Mitford was raised to the peerage as Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland, on 15 July 1902. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, who is chiefly remembered as the father of the famous Mitford sisters. He was also a member of the Right Club, founded by Archibald Maule Ramsay. His only son, the Hon. Thomas Freeman-Mitford, was killed in action in Burma in 1945.

Lord Redesdale was therefore succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1935. He died childless in 1962 when the title passed to his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He died in the following year, also childless, and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Ernest Rupert Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, fifth son of the first Baron.

, the title is held by the fifth Baron&#x27;s son, the sixth Baron, who succeeded in 1991. He is a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords, who in 2000 was created a life peer as Baron Mitford, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland, to enable him to return to the House after the majority of hereditary peers lost their seats under the House of Lords Act 1999.

==Barons Redesdale, first creation (1802)==
*John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale (1748–1830)
*John Thomas Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale (1805–1886; created Earl of Redesdale in 1877)

===Earl of Redesdale (1877)===
*John Thomas Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale (1805–1886)

<doc id="513878" wikidata="Q79863" url="?curid=513878" title="Tskhinvali">
<text>Tskhinvali ( ) or Tskhinval (, ; , ) is the capital of the disputed &quot;de facto&quot; independent Republic of South Ossetia, internationally considered part of Shida Kartli, Georgia (except by the Russian Federation and four other UN member states). Tskhinvali Region, known historically as Samachablo, was always part of the Georgian state as a single military and administrative entity. It is located on the Great Liakhvi River approximately northwest of the Georgian capital Tbilisi.

==Name==
The name of Tskhinvali is derived from the Old Georgian &quot;Krtskhinvali&quot; (), from earlier &quot;Krtskhilvani&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;the land of hornbeams&quot;, which is the historical name of the city. See for more.

From 1934 to 1961, the city was named Staliniri (, ), which was a compilation of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s surname with Ossetian word &quot;Ir&quot; which means Ossetia. Modern Ossetians call the city Tskhinval (leaving off the final &quot;i&quot;, which is a nominative case ending in Georgian); the other Ossetian name of the city is Chreba () which is only spread as a colloquial word. The name Chreba comes from the Georgian &quot;Ḳreba&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;gathering&quot; due to the city historically serving as a trading point.

==History==
The area around the present-day Tskhinvali was first populated back in the Bronze Age. The unearthed settlements and archaeological artifacts from that time are unique in that they reflect influences from both Iberian (east Georgia) and Colchian (west Georgia) cultures with possible Sarmatian elements.
Tskhinvali was first chronicled by Georgian sources in 1398 as a village in Kartli (central Georgia) though a later account credits the 3rd century AD Georgian king Aspacures II of Iberia with its foundation as a fortress. By the early 18th century, Tskhinvali was a small &quot;royal town&quot; populated chiefly by monastic serfs. Tskhinvali was annexed to the Russian Empire along with the rest of eastern Georgia in 1801. Located on a trade route which linked North Caucasus to Tbilisi and Gori, Tskhinvali gradually developed into a commercial town with a mixed Georgian Jewish, Georgian, Armenian and Ossetian population. In 1917, it had 600 houses with 38.4% Georgian Jews, 34.4% Georgians, 17.7% Armenians and 8.8% Ossetians.

The town saw clashes between Georgian People&#x27;s Guard and pro-Bolshevik Ossetian peasants during the 1918–20 period, when Georgia gained brief independence from Russia. Soviet rule was established by the invading Red Army in March 1921, and a year later, in 1922, Tskhinvali was made a capital of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the Georgian SSR. Subsequently, the town became largely Ossetian due to intense urbanisation and Soviet Korenizatsiya (&quot;nativization&quot;) policy which induced an inflow of the Ossetians from the nearby rural areas into Tskhinvali. It was essentially an industrial centre, with lumber mills and manufacturing plants, and had also several cultural and educational institutions such as a venerated Pedagogical Institute (currently Tskhinvali State University) and a drama theatre. According to the last Soviet census (in 1989), Tskhinvali had a population of 42,934, and according to the census of Republic of South Ossetia in 2015, the population was 30,432 people.

During the acute phase of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, Tskhinvali was a scene of ethnic tensions and ensuing armed confrontation between Georgian and Ossetian forces. The 1992 Sochi ceasefire accord left Tskhinvali in the hands of Ossetians.

===Russo-Georgian War===

A considerable part of the population of South Ossetia (at least, 30,000 out of 70,000) fled into North Ossetia–Alania prior or immediately after the start of the 2008 war. However, many civilians were killed during the shelling and the following Battle of Tskhinvali (162 civilian deaths were documented by the Russian team of investigators and 365 – by the South Ossetian authorities). The town was heavily damaged during the battle due to extensive shelling by the Georgian Army. Andrey Illarionov visited the town in October 2008, and reported that Jewish Quarter indeed was in ruins, though he observed that the ruins were overgrown with shrubs and trees, which indicates that the destruction took place during the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War. However, Mark Ames, who was covering the last war for The Nation, stated that Tskhinvali&#x27;s main residential district, nicknamed Shanghai because of its population density (it&#x27;s where most of the city&#x27;s high-rise apartment blocks are located), and the old Jewish Quarter, were completely destroyed.

==Geography==

=== Climate ===
Located in the Caucasus, at above sea level, Tskhinvali has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with an average annual precipitation of . Summers are mild and winters are cold, with snowfalls.

==Present==

Currently, Tskhinvali functions as the capital of South Ossetia. Before the 2008 war it had a population of approximately 30,000. The town remained significantly impoverished in the absence of a permanent political settlement between the two sides in the past two decades.

On 21 August 2008, a world-known Russian conductor and director of the Mariinsky Theatre, of Ossetian origin, Valery Gergiev conducted a concert near the ruined building of South Ossetian parliament in memory of the Ossetian victims of the Russo-Georgian War.

==Transport==
There was a railway service before 1991 at the Tskhinvali Railway station connecting the city with Gori.

==International relations==

<text>Baron Ritchie of Dundee, of Welders in the Parish of Chalfont St Giles in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1905 for the Conservative politician Charles Ritchie. He was Home Secretary between 1900 and 1902 and Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1902 and 1903.

He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Baron. He was Chairman of the Port of London Authority from 1925 to 1941. His son, the third Baron, served as Chairman of the London Stock Exchange from 1959 to 1965 and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1965. When he died the title passed to his younger brother, the fourth Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s only son, the sixth Baron, who succeeded in 2008.

Another member of the Ritchie family was Sir James Thomson Ritchie, 1st Baronet, Lord Mayor of London from 1903 to 1904. He was the elder brother of the first Baron Ritchie of Dundee.

<text>Challenge riding is a form of cycling where the riders challenge themselves rather than each other. Some challenge rides are charity events or pledge rides. Some are organised as pre- or early-season training events (sometimes in the UK called reliability trials). Others, often referred to as &quot;Randonnées&quot;, &quot;brevets&quot; or Audax events occur simply for the sake of the challenge; cyclosportive events allow cyclists to test themselves over challenging race routes used, for example L&#x27;Étape du Tour in the Tour de France. Most challenge rides are open to all comers, but a few require qualification to attend.

Challenge rides may be day rides of fixed distance (e.g. 50 km, 100 km, 100 miles) or multi-day trips that span a state, country or province, such as RAGBRAI in Iowa and the End to End in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="513883" wikidata="Q830445" url="?curid=513883" title="Northbridge (computing)">
<text>In computing, a northbridge (also host bridge, or memory controller hub) is a microchip that comprises the core logic chipset architecture on motherboards to handle high-performance tasks, especially for older personal computers. It is connected directly to a CPU via the front-side bus (FSB), and is usually used in conjunction with a slower southbridge to manage communication between the CPU and other parts of the motherboard.

Historically, separation of functions between CPU, northbridge, and southbridge chips was necessary due to the difficulty of integrating all components onto a single chip die. However, as CPU speeds increased over time, a bottleneck emerged due to limitations caused by data transmission between the CPU and its support chipset. The trend for integrated northbridges began near the end of the 2000sfor example, the Nvidia GeForce 320M GPU in the 2010 MacBook Air was a northbridge/southbridge/GPU combo chip.

On older Intel based PCs, the northbridge was also named external memory controller hub or graphics and memory controller hub if equipped with integrated graphics. Increasingly these functions became integrated into the CPU chip itself, beginning with memory and graphics controllers. Since the 2010s, die shrink and improved transistor density have allowed for increasing chipset integration, and the functions performed by northbridges are now often incorporated into other components such as southbridges or CPUs themselves.

Intel and AMD have both released chipsets in which all northbridge functions had been integrated into the CPU. The corresponding southbridge was renamed by Intel as the Platform Controller Hub and by AMD as the Fusion controller hub. AMD FX CPUs continued to require external northbridge and southbridge chips. Modern Intel Core processors have the northbridge integrated on the CPU die, where it is known as the uncore or system agent.

==Overview==
The northbridge typically handles communications among the CPU, in some cases RAM, and PCI Express (or AGP) video cards, and the southbridge. Some northbridges also contain integrated video controllers, also known as a Graphics and Memory Controller Hub in Intel systems. Because different processors and RAM require different signaling, a given northbridge will typically work with only one or two classes of CPUs and generally only one type of RAM.

There are a few chipsets that support two types of RAM; generally, these are made available when there is a shift to a new standard. For example, the northbridge from the 2002 Nvidia nForce2 chipset only worked with Socket A processors combined with DDR SDRAM.

=== PowerPC ===
Northbridge chips are most commonly found on X86-based PCs, but they can also be found on other platforms, such as the PowerPC platform. A common example of a northbridge on a PowerPC platform is in Apple&#x27;s older PowerPC-based computers like the iMac G5, which utilized an IBM CPC945 Northbridge chip. According to an Apple Developer note, The Power Mac G5&#x27;s northbridge chip connected to a &quot;Mid Bridge&quot;, which then connected to a south bridge.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from drawing the architecture in the fashion of a map. The CPU would be at the top of the map comparable to due north on most general purpose geographical maps. The CPU would be connected to the chipset via a fast bridge (the northbridge) located north of other system devices as drawn. The northbridge would then be connected to the rest of the chipset via a slow bridge (the southbridge) located south of other system devices as drawn.

==Overclocking==
The northbridge plays an important part in how far a computer can be overclocked, as its frequency is commonly used as a baseline for the CPU to establish its own operating frequency. This chip typically gets hotter as processor speed becomes faster, requiring more cooling. There is a limit to CPU overclocking, as digital circuits are limited by physical factors such as rise, fall, delay and storage times of the transistors, current gain bandwidth product, parasitic capacitance, and propagation delay, which increases with (among other factors) operating temperature; consequently most overclocking applications have software-imposed limits on the multiplier and external clock setting. Additionally, heat is a major limiting factor, as higher voltages are needed to properly activate field effect transistors inside CPUs and this higher voltage produces larger amounts of heat, requiring greater thermal solutions on the die.

==Evolution==

The overall trend in processor design has been to integrate more functions onto fewer components, which decreases overall motherboard cost and improves performance. The memory controller, which handles communication between the CPU and RAM, was moved onto the processor die by AMD beginning with their AMD K8 processors and by Intel with their Nehalem processors. One of the advantages of having the memory controller integrated on the CPU die is to reduce latency from the CPU to memory.

Some northbridge chips have supported dual processors, for example Intel&#x27;s 5000X memory controller used in the original Mac Pro from 2006.

Another example of this kind of change is Nvidia&#x27;s nForce3 for AMD K8 systems. It combines all of the features of a normal southbridge with an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) port and connects directly to the CPU. On nForce4 boards it was marketed as a media communications processor (MCP).

AMD Accelerated Processing Unit processors feature full integration of northbridge functions onto the CPU chip or package, along with processor cores, memory controller, high speed PCI Express interface (usually for graphics card), and integrated graphics processing unit (iGPU). This was an evolution of the AMD K8, since the memory controller was integrated on the CPU die in the AMD64.

The northbridge was replaced by the system agent introduced by the Intel Sandy Bridge microarchitecture in 2011, which essentially handles all previous Northbridge functions. Intel&#x27;s Sandy Bridge processors feature full integration of northbridge functions onto the CPU chip, along with processor cores, memory controller, high speed PCI Express interface and integrated graphics processing unit (GPU). This was a further evolution of the Westmere architecture, which also featured a CPU and GPU in the same package.

Recent AMD processors starting with the Zen 2 have moved some I/O functions out of the CPU die onto an I/O die on the same MCM package as the CPU. This die is not normally considered to be part of the Northbridge, since it is in the same package as the CPU, but it serves some of the same functions.

<text>Baron Rowallan, of Rowallan in the County of Ayr, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1911 for the Liberal politician Archibald Corbett. He had previously represented Glasgow Tradeston in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baron, fought in both World Wars, was Chief Scout and served as Governor of Tasmania. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1993.

The family seat was initially Rowallan Castle, near Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire. This historic property was bequeathed by the second Baron to his grandson, the future fourth Baron, bypassing the latter&#x27;s father, the third Baron, possibly because the third baron had earned disrepute in a highly unusual divorce suit against his second wife, April Ashley. The fourth Baron now resides at Meikle Mosside Farm, near Fenwick, Ayrshire, which may now be regarded as the family seat.

==Barons Rowallan (1911)==
*Archibald Cameron Corbett, 1st Baron Rowallan (1856–1933)
*Thomas Godfrey Polson Corbett, 2nd Baron Rowallan (1895–1977)
*Arthur Cameron Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan (1919–1993)
*John Polson Cameron Corbett, 4th Baron Rowallan (b. 1947)
The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son the Hon. Jason William Polson Cameron Corbett (b. 1972).&lt;br&gt;The heir apparent&#x27;s heir apparent is his son Alexander William Cameron Corbett (b. 2004)

<text>Jana Sterbak (Jana Štěrbáková) is a multidisciplinary artist of Czech origin.

==Life and career==
Sterbak earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Concordia University, completing classes in film history with John Locke and Tom Waugh, as well as painting with Yves Gaucher Guido Molinari. In the 1980s, she studied art history at the University of Toronto and at New York University, ultimately abandoning her studies to dedicate herself to her artistic practice. In her artistic approach, performance is incorporated into her photography, film, and video installations.

In the 1990s, Sterbak moved to Paris to teach at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts (ENSBA). At age 36, a retrospective of her work was held at the National Gallery of Canada (1991) and subsequently shown at MIT in Boston and at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (1992).

Her European career began in 1990 at Aperto, the international section of the Venice Biennale, where co-curator Bernard Blistène chose to present her work. Several solo shows followed: in 1992, at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (Denmark) and at the MoMA New York, where one of her iconic installations, &quot;Sisyphus,&quot; was presented (this work then joined MAC Marseille&#x27;s collection,) and in 1993 at La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona. &quot;Velleitas&quot;, a solo exhibition curated by Corinne Diserens was presented in 1995 at the Musee d’art moderne of Saint-Étienne and at Fundació Antoni Tàpies in Barcelona, and at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1996.

In the early 2000s, she produced two video installations. The first, &quot;From Here to there&quot;, represented Canada at the 2003 Venice Biennale; the second, &quot;Waiting for High Water&quot;, shot in Venice during the &quot;acqua alta&quot; phenomenon, was presented at the Prague Biennale in 2005. &quot;Waiting for High Water&quot; became her most exhibited video installation (catalogue text from Hubert Damisch.)

In 2012, Sterbak, a Canadian citizen since her twentieth birthday, received a Governor General&#x27;s Award in the Visual and Media Arts, and in 2017, she won the Prix Paul-Émile-Borduas (Quebec).

&quot;Her biography may not be directly reflected in her works, but it has provided a pool of experience for an examination of the question of how different societies are connected with one another. These are questions pertaining to human conflicts in contemporary life, to the tension between the private and public spheres, and between freedom and dependence.
Jana Sterbak’s works are as poetic as they are political. They are conceptually precise, interweaving the immediacy of specific materials with references to motifs from mythology, literature, and philosophy. Her materials are often ephemeral and transformative, such as the ice that forms the slowly melting chairs of &quot;Dissolution-Auditorium&quot;, or the pieces of flesh sewn together to make a dress in her famous and much-discussed work and widely copied &quot;Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorexic&quot;.&quot; Both are powerful metaphors for social as well as physical processes that speak to us explicitly on a personal and sensory level.

Jana Sterbak’s artwork is notable in terms of its form and function, often at odds with each other. Several of her pieces take the familiar shape of furniture or clothing, but the use of incongruous materials give the work an alternate meaning. Her palette ranges from metal and wire, which may be considered permanent, unyielding, or restrictive, to the likes of bread, cake, chocolate, and/or meat, all of which are organic and evoke associations with food as well as the element of decomposition. 

In a 1989 newspaper article, titled, “Art that is absolutely shocking,” author Brian Volke of The Leader-Post writes, “The works can be grouped into two general categories, furniture and dresses, both of which are usually considered part of the feminine domain. Both furniture- specifically beds and couches - and women symbolize similar things: rest, relaxation, care and pleasure. And both have been treated as commodities. Sterbak attacks these associations.” The article continues to cite specific installations of Sterbak’s work being shown at the Mackenzie Art Gallery, including, “Seduction Couch (1986-87), a chaise lounge of perforated steel. Equipped with a Van de Graaff generator, the couch provides an electrostatic charge that makes one anything but comfortable.” Attitudes (1987), features a king-sized bed with embroidered pillows that read, “Disease, Reputation,” and “Greed,” and also mentioned is an electrified wire garment titled, “I Want You To Feel the Way I Do… (The Dress).” Sterbak’s iconic piece, “Vanitas- Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic,” (1987) is noted for the way it, “conjures images of women as “pieces of meat” - commodities who starve themselves to fit into fashionable clothes. And the title reflects the perspective of an anorectic woman who, the meaning is clear, would rather wear a flesh dress than eat one,” 

In 1992, Sterbak created “Catacombs,” in which various bones have been cast from solid chocolate, creating a sweet, edible, and incomplete human skeleton. In 1997, Jana Sterbak’s creations of a “bread bed” and “cake stool” play with symbols of livelihood. The comfort of an armchair takes on a morbid quality in “Chair Apollinaire,” (1996), made from raw meat. Artworks such as these might cause the viewer to question the value we place on food, and life, as such a fleeting and precious thing.

<doc id="513895" wikidata="Q816260" url="?curid=513895" title="Rebus">
<text>A rebus ( ) is a puzzle device that combines the use of illustrated pictures with individual letters to depict words or phrases. For example: the word &quot;been&quot; might be depicted by a rebus showing an illustrated bumblebee next to a plus sign (+) and the letter &quot;n&quot;.

It was a favourite form of heraldic expression used in the Middle Ages to denote surnames. For example, in its basic form, three salmon (fish) are used to denote the surname &quot;Salmon&quot;. A more sophisticated example was the rebus of Bishop Walter Lyhart (d. 1472) of Norwich, consisting of a stag (or hart) lying down in a conventional representation of water. The composition alludes to the name, profession or personal characteristics of the bearer, and speaks to the beholder &quot;Non verbis, sed rebus&quot;, which Latin expression signifies &quot;not by words but by things&quot; (&quot;res, rei&quot; (f), a thing, object, matter; &quot;rebus&quot; being ablative plural).

==Rebuses within heraldry==

Rebuses are used extensively as a form of heraldic expression as a hint to the name of the bearer; they are not synonymous with canting arms. A man might have a rebus as a personal identification device entirely separate from his armorials, canting or otherwise. For example, Sir Richard Weston (d. 1541) bore as arms: &quot;Ermine, on a chief azure five bezants&quot;, whilst his rebus, displayed many times in terracotta plaques on the walls of his mansion Sutton Place, Surrey, was a &quot;tun&quot; or barrel, used to designate the last syllable of his surname.

An example of canting arms proper are those of the Borough of Congleton in Cheshire consisting of a conger eel, a lion (in Latin, &quot;leo&quot;) and a tun (barrel). This word sequence &quot;conger-leo-tun&quot; enunciates the town&#x27;s name. Similarly, the coat of arms of St. Ignatius Loyola contains wolves (in Spanish, &quot;lobo&quot;) and a kettle (&quot;olla&quot;), said by some (probably incorrectly) to be a rebus for &quot;Loyola&quot;. The arms of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon feature bows and lions.

==Modern rebuses, word plays==

A modern example of the rebus used as a form of word play is:
:H + = &quot;Hear&quot;, or &quot;Here&quot;.
By extension, it also uses the positioning of words or parts of words in relation to each other to convey a hidden meaning, for example:
:p walk ark&quot;: walk in the park.

A rebus made up solely of letters (such as &quot;CU&quot; for &quot;See you&quot;) is known as a gramogram, grammagram, or letteral word. This concept is sometimes extended to include numbers (as in &quot;Q8&quot; for &quot;Kuwait&quot;, or &quot;8&quot; for &quot;ate&quot;). Rebuses are sometimes used in crossword puzzles, with multiple letters or a symbol fitting into a single square.

==Pictograms==

The term &quot;rebus&quot; also refers to the use of a pictogram to represent a syllabic sound. This adapts pictograms into phonograms. A precursor to the development of the alphabet, this process represents one of the most important developments of writing. Fully developed hieroglyphs read in rebus fashion were in use at Abydos in Egypt as early as 3400 BCE. In Mesopotamia, the principle was first employed on Proto-Cuneiform tablets, beginning in the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 3100–2900 BC).

The writing of correspondence in rebus form became popular in the eighteenth century and continued into the nineteenth century. Lewis Carroll wrote the children he befriended picture-puzzle rebus letters, nonsense letters, and looking-glass letters, which had to be held in front of a mirror to be read. Rebus letters served either as a sort of code or simply as a pastime.

==Rebus principle==

In linguistics, the rebus principle is the use of existing symbols, such as pictograms, purely for their sounds regardless of their meaning, to represent new words. Many ancient writing systems used what we now term &#x27;the rebus principle&#x27; to represent abstract words, which otherwise would be hard to represent with pictograms. An example that illustrates the Rebus principle is the representation of the sentence &quot;I can see you&quot; by using the pictographs of &quot;eye—can—sea—ewe&quot;.

Some linguists believe that the Chinese developed their writing system according to the rebus principle, and Egyptian hieroglyphs sometimes used a similar system. A famous rebus statue of Ramses II uses three hieroglyphs to compose his name: Horus (as Ra), for &quot;Ra&quot;; the child, &quot;mes&quot;; and the sedge plant (stalk held in left hand), &quot;su&quot;; the name Ra-mes-su is then formed.

Sigmund Freud posited that the rebus was the basis for uncovering the latent content of the dream. He wrote, &quot;A dream is a picture puzzle of this sort and our predecessors in the
field of dream interpretation have made the mistake of treating the rebus as a pictorial composition: and as such it has seemed to them
nonsensical and worthless.&quot;

==Use in game shows==
Canada
* 1980s children&#x27;s game show &quot;Kidstreet&quot; featured a rebus during the bonus round (or &quot;final lap&quot;).

United Kingdom
* &quot;Catchphrase&quot; is a long-running game show which requires contestants to decipher a rebus. The show began as a short-lived American game show hosted by Art James before being seen in the United Kingdom from 1986 to 2004 and returning in 2013. There was also an Australian version of the show hosted by John Burgess.
* In 1998, Granada TV produced &quot;Waffle&quot;, a single word rebus puzzle show that was hosted by Nick Weir, and included premium telephone line viewer participation.

United States
* Rebuses were central to the television game show &quot;Concentration.&quot; Contestants had to solve a rebus, usually partially concealed behind any of thirty numbered &quot;squares&quot;, to win a game. An updated version, known as &quot;Classic Concentration,&quot; shrank the board to twenty-five squares. There were also British and Australian versions of the game.
* The HBO children&#x27;s game series &quot;Crashbox&quot; features three rebus puzzles in the game segment &quot;Ten Seconds.&quot;
* A short-lived ABC game show from 1965 known as &quot;The Rebus Game&quot; also involved contestants creating rebuses to communicate an answer.
* The Nickelodeon game show &quot;Get the Picture&quot; features a Power Surge called &quot;Rebus Mania&quot;, in which the teams had 30 seconds to guess the rebus that was shown.

India
* &quot;Dadagiri Unlimited&quot; is a game show in which some rebus puzzles are used in the googly round. The show is broadcast by Zee Bangla and hosted by the former Indian cricketer Sourav Ganguly.

==Historical examples==

* It is reported that when Voltaire was the guest of Frederick the Great at Sanssouci Palace, they exchanged puzzle notes. Frederick sent over a page with two picture blocks on it: two hands below the letter P, and then the number 100 below a picture of a handsaw, all followed by a question mark. Voltaire replied with: Ga!

:Both messages were rebuses in the French language: &quot;deux mains sous Pé à cent sous scie?&quot; &quot;two hands under &#x27;p&#x27; at [one] hundred under saw&quot; = &quot;demain souper à Sanssouci?&quot; &quot;supper tomorrow at Sanssouci?&quot;); reply: &quot;Gé grand, A petit!&quot; &quot;big &#x27;G&#x27;, small &#x27;a&#x27;!&quot; (= &quot;j&#x27;ai grand appétit!&quot; &quot;I am very hungry!&quot;).
* The early sixteenth-century Bishop of Exeter, Hugh Oldham, adopted the owl as his personal device. It bore a scroll in its beak bearing the letters D.O.M., forming a rebus based on his surname, which would probably have been pronounced at the time as &quot;owl-dom&quot;.
* The nineteenth-century French sculptor Jean-Pierre Dantan would place rebuses on the socles of his caricature busts to identify the subject. For example, Victor Hugo was an axe (&quot;hache&quot; in French, which sounds like the French pronunciation of &quot;H&quot;) + UG + crossed bones (&quot;os&quot;, sounding like &quot;O&quot;). Hector Berlioz was represented by the letters BER low on the socle, with a bed (&quot;lit&quot;, for &quot;li&quot;) comparatively high on the socle (to mean &quot;haut&quot;, the French for high, pronounced with a silent &quot;h&quot; and &quot;t&quot; and the digraph &quot;au&quot; sounding like &quot;O&quot;).
* Rebus Bibles such as &quot;A Curious Hieroglyphic Bible&quot; were popular in the late eighteenth century for teaching children to read the Bible.
* Franciscans interacting with Nahuatl-speaking groups found that the Cholultecans used rebus principles to record information in Latin. The Cholultecans learned the Pater Noster or Lord&#x27;s Prayer with the aid of drawing pictures of a &quot;pantli&quot; (flag or banner) to represent &quot;pater&quot; and a picture of a prickly pear, &quot;nochtli,&quot; for &quot;noster&quot;. This practice was seen as a strength of the people&#x27;s pictographic literacy.

==Japan==

In Japan, the rebus known as was immensely popular during the Edo period. A piece by ukiyo-e artist Kunisada was &quot;Actor Puzzles&quot; (&quot;Yakusha hanjimono&quot;) that featured rebuses.

Today the most often seen of these symbols is a picture of a sickle, a circle, and the letter , read as , interpreted as , the old-fashioned form of . This is known as the , and dates to circa 1700, being used in kabuki since circa 1815.

Kabuki actors would wear &quot;yukata&quot; and other clothing whose pictorial design, in rebus, represented their Yagō &quot;guild names&quot;, and would distribute tenugui cloth with their rebused names as well. The practice was not restricted to the acting profession and was undertaken by townsfolk of various walks of life. There were also pictorial calendars called egoyomi that represented the Japanese calendar in rebus so it could be &quot;read&quot; by the illiterate.

Today a number of abstract examples following certain conventions are occasionally used for names, primarily for corporate logos or product logos and incorporating some characters of the name, as in a monogram; see Japanese rebus monogram. The most familiar example globally is the logo for Yamasa soy sauce, which is a ∧ with a サ under it. This is read as &quot;Yama&quot;, for (symbolized by the ∧) + .

<doc id="513897" wikidata="Q2437385" url="?curid=513897" title="Canting">
<text>(IPA: , VOS Spelling: , ) is a pen-like tool used to apply liquid hot wax () in the batik-making process in Indonesia, more precisely (). Traditional consists of copper wax-container with small pipe spout and bamboo handle. Traditional is made of copper, bronze, zinc or iron material, however modern version might use teflon.

==Etymology==

&quot;&quot; is derived from Javanese word of &quot;canthing&quot; (IPA: ) which means the small scooping tool.

== History ==

&quot;Canting&quot; is originated in Java and invented by the Javanese, it is believed to be invented since 12th century.
G. P. Rouffaer reported that the &quot;gringsing&quot; batik pattern was already known by the 12th century in Kediri, East Java. He concluded that this delicate pattern could only be created by the &quot;canting&quot;, an etching tool that holds a small reservoir of hot wax.


== Design ==

A &quot;canting&quot; consists of:
# Nyamplung: a rounded liquid wax container, made from copper.
# Cucuk (IPA:): a small copper pipe or spout that connects to &quot;nyamplung&quot; container, it is where the liquid wax comes out to be applied to the cloth.
# Gagang: &quot;canting&quot; holder, usually made from bamboo or wood.

The size of &quot;canting&quot; may be varied according to the desired dot size or line thickness to be applied to the cloth. A batik craftsperson uses &quot;canting&quot; in a similar fashion as drawing using a pen.

== Types ==

There are three ways of classifying the types of &quot;canting&quot;:
# Based on its function:
## &quot;Canting&quot; &quot;Rengrengan&quot;: &quot;canting&quot; that is ideally used to make a batik pattern for the first time.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Isen: &quot;canting&quot; that is ideally used to fill a pattern that has been made beforehand.
# Based on the diameter of its &quot;cucuk&quot;:
## Small &quot;Canting&quot;: &quot;canting&quot; that has a small-sized &quot;cucuk&quot; with a diameter of less than 1 millimeter and is usually used as &quot;Canting Isen&quot;.
## Medium &quot;Canting&quot;: &quot;canting&quot; that has a medium-sized &quot;cucuk&quot; with a diameter of 1 – 2.5 millimeters and is usually used as &quot;Canting Rengrengan&quot;.
## Large &quot;Canting&quot;: &quot;canting&quot; with a large-sized &quot;cucuk&quot; with a diameter of more than 2.5 millimeters and is usually used to make a larger batik pattern or to fill a pattern that has been made beforehand with a block of wax.
# Based on the number of its &quot;cucuk&quot;:
## Canting&quot; &quot;Cecekan: &quot;canting&quot; with one &quot;cucuk&quot;.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Laron/Loron: &quot;canting&quot; with two &quot;cucuk&quot;.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Telon: &quot;canting&quot; with three &quot;cucuk&quot; that forms an equilateral triangle.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Prapatan: &quot;canting&quot; with four &quot;cucuk&quot; that forms a square.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Liman: &quot;canting&quot; with five &quot;cucuk&quot; that forms a square with a dot in the center of the square.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Byok: &quot;canting&quot; with an odd number of &quot;cucuk&quot; and is equal to or more than seven &quot;cucuk&quot; that forms a circle with a dot in the center of the circle.
## Canting&quot; &quot;Renteng/Galaran: &quot;canting&quot; with four or six &quot;cucuk&quot; that forms two parallel lines.

==Technique==
Firstly, the cloth must be washed, soaked and beaten with a large mallet. The hot and liquid wax is scooped from small &quot;wajan&quot; (wok) heated upon small stove. The batik craftsperson sometimes blow the spout tip of &quot;canting&quot; to allow the liquid wax to flow smoothly and to avoid clogging, then they draw the line or dot upon the cloth, applying the liquid wax, following the patterns and images that previously had been drawn using pencil. A pattern is then drawn with hot wax called &quot;malam&quot; using &quot;canting&quot;. The wax functions as a dye-resist. After this, the cloth is dipped in a dye bath containing the first colour. After the cloth is dry, the wax is removed by scraping or boiling the cloth. This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired. For larger areas of cloth which need to be covered, the wax is applied using a tool called &quot;nemboki/mopoki&quot;.

<doc id="513906" wikidata="Q4738646" url="?curid=513906" title="Alydar">
<text>Alydar (March 23, 1975 – November 15, 1990) was an American Thoroughbred race horse and sire. A chestnut colt, he was most famous for finishing a close second to Affirmed in all three races of the 1978 Triple Crown. With each successive race, Alydar narrowed Affirmed&#x27;s margin of victory; Affirmed won by 1.5 lengths in the Kentucky Derby, by a neck in the Preakness and by a head in the Belmont Stakes. Alydar has been described as the best horse in the history of Thoroughbred racing never to have won a championship. Alydar&#x27;s fame continued when he got older. He died under suspicious circumstances.

==Racing career==
Trained by John M. Veitch (who also trained Alydar&#x27;s half-sister, Eclipse Award winning Our Mims) and ridden by jockey Jorge Velásquez, in 1978 Alydar dueled with Affirmed in all three legs of the Triple Crown. He lost to his arch-rival by a combined total of less than two lengths across the three legs. The 1978 Belmont Stakes, the third (and final) leg of the series, is considered by many as one of the most exciting races in the history of the sport. In that race, Alydar and Affirmed dueled side by side from the middle of the far turn all the way to the wire, with Affirmed barely holding on to win by a head to claim the Triple Crown.

In his racing career Alydar won 14 of 26 starts, finishing second 9 times and third once, and earned purses totalling $957,195. He raced against Affirmed ten times in his career, winning thrice. Alydar was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1989. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Alydar was ranked #27.

==At stud==
Alydar was a major success as a stallion. His offspring include Hall of Fame Eclipse Award Champion Easy Goer; Alysheba, winner of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic; Kandaly, 1994 Louisiana Derby winner; Turkoman, Strike the Gold, Criminal Type, Althea, Alydaress, Benchmark, Stella Madrid, and Miss Oceana. He is also the broodmare sire of Peintre Celebre, Cat Thief, Anees, Ajina, Aly&#x27;s Alley, Gio Ponti, and Lure.

==Suspicious death==
On November 13, 1990, Alydar appeared to have shattered his right hind leg in his stall at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. Emergency surgery was performed the next day in an attempt to repair the injury, but the leg broke again. On November 15, Alydar was euthanized. At the time the owner of Calumet Farm was in dire trouble financially, but suspicions of foul play by the management were not raised until federal prosecutors investigated in the late 1990s. John Thomas (J.T.) Lundy was indicted and convicted in 2000 on separate but related fraud charges—bribing a bank executive for favorable loans—and served nearly four years in prison. The farm&#x27;s former attorney, Gary Matthews, was also convicted and received a 21-month prison sentence. The &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; described Alydar&#x27;s death as &quot;a sweeping saga of greed, fraud, and almost unimaginable cruelty that could have been lifted straight from a best-selling Dick Francis horse-racing novel.&quot; Alydar is buried at Calumet Farm.

In Houston federal court, MIT professor George Pratt testified that Alydar had to have been killed. He speculated that someone had tied the end of a rope around Alydar&#x27;s leg and attached the other end of the rope to a truck that could easily have been driven into the stallion barn. The truck then took off, pulling Alydar&#x27;s leg from underneath him until it snapped; he testified that the force involved was at least three times that which a horse was able to exert. About five days before Alydar&#x27;s injury his original night watchman, Harold &quot;Cowboy&quot; Kipp, testified that he was at work on the farm when he was ordered to take Tuesday, November 13 off.

== Rivalry with Affirmed ==

Final: Affirmed 7, Alydar 3

*In their final meeting, Affirmed drifted in, forcing Alydar to be taken up on the backstretch. While Affirmed finished ahead of Alydar, the stewards decided to disqualify Affirmed from first to second, giving Alydar the final win.

<doc id="513908" wikidata="Q131056" url="?curid=513908" title="Megalosaurus">
<text>Megalosaurus (meaning &quot;great lizard&quot;, from Greek , &#x27;, meaning &#x27;big&#x27;, &#x27;tall&#x27; or &#x27;great&#x27; and ,&#x27;, meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;) is an extinct genus of large carnivorous theropod dinosaurs of the Middle Jurassic Epoch (Bathonian stage, 166 million years ago) of southern England. Although fossils from other areas have been assigned to the genus, the only certain remains of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; come from Oxfordshire and date to the late Middle Jurassic.

The earliest remains of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; were described in the 17th century, and were initially interpreted as the remains of elephants or giants. &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was named in 1824 by William Buckland, becoming the first genus of (non-avian) dinosaur to be validly named. The type species is M. bucklandii, named in 1827 by Gideon Mantell, after Buckland. In 1842, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was one of three genera on which Richard Owen based his Dinosauria. On Owen&#x27;s directions a model was made as one of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Over 50 other species would eventually be classified under the genus; at first, this was because so few types of dinosaur had been identified, but the practice continued even into the 20th century after many other dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood that none of these additional species was directly related to &quot;M. bucklandii&quot;, which is the only true &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.

The first naturalists who investigated &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; mistook it for a gigantic lizard in length. In 1842, Owen concluded that it was no longer than . He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists were able to obtain a more accurate picture, by comparing &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae. &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was about long, weighing about . It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.

At the time &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; lived, Europe formed an island archipelago around the Tethys Ocean, with &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; inhabiting an island formed by the London–Brabant Massif, where it likely served as the apex predator of its ecosystem, coexisting with other dinosaurs like the large sauropod &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;.

== Discovery and naming ==
=== Edward Lhuyd&#x27;s tooth (specimen OU 1328) ===

In 1699, Edward Lhuyd described what he believed to have been a fish tooth (called &quot;Plectronites&quot;), later believed to be part of a belemnite, that was illustrated alongside the holotype tooth of the sauropod &quot;Rutellum impicatum&quot; and another tooth, from a theropod, in 1699. Later studies found that the theropod tooth, known as specimen 1328 (University of Oxford coll. #1328; lost?) almost certainly was a tooth crown that belonged to an unknown species of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. OU 1328 has since been lost and it was not confidently assigned to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; until the tooth was re-described by Delair &amp; Sarjeant (2002).

OU 1328 was collected near Caswell, near Witney, Oxfordshire sometime during the 17th century and became the third dinosaur fossil to ever be illustrated, after &quot;Scrotum humanum&quot; in 1677 and &quot;Rutellum impicatum&quot; in 1699.

=== &quot;Scrotum humanum&quot; ===
&quot;Megalosaurus&quot; may have been the first non avian dinosaur to be described in the scientific literature. The earliest possible fossil of the genus, from the Taynton Limestone Formation, was the lower part of a femur, discovered in the 17th century. It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thigh bone of a Roman war elephant, and then as a biblical giant. Part of a bone was recovered from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield limestone quarry, Oxfordshire in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description and illustration in his &quot;Natural History of Oxfordshire&quot; in 1676. It was the first illustration of a dinosaur bone published. Plot correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the thighbone or femur of a large animal and he recognized that it was too large to belong to any species known to be living in England. He therefore at first concluded it to be the thigh bone of a Roman war elephant and later that of a giant human, such as those mentioned in the Bible. The bone has since been lost, but the illustration is detailed enough that some have since identified it as that of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;.

It has also been argued that this possible &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; bone was given the very first species name ever applied to an extinct dinosaur. Plot&#x27;s engraving of the Cornwell bone was again used in a book by Richard Brookes in 1763. Brookes, in a caption, called it &quot;Scrotum humanum&quot;, apparently comparing its appearance to a pair of &quot;human testicles&quot;. However, it is possible that the attribution of this name stemmed from illustrator error, not Richard Brookes. In 1970, paleontologist Lambert Beverly Halstead pointed out that the similarity of &quot;Scrotum humanum&quot; to a modern species name, a so-called Linnaean &quot;binomen&quot; that has two parts, was not a coincidence. Linnaeus, the founder of modern taxonomy, had in the eighteenth century not merely devised a system for naming living creatures, but also for classifying geological objects. The book by Brookes was all about applying this latter system to curious stones found in England. According to Halstead, Brookes thus had deliberately used binomial nomenclature, and had in fact indicated the possible type specimen of a new biological genus. According to the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name &quot;Scrotum humanum&quot; in principle had priority over &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; because it was published first. That Brookes understood that the stone did not actually represent a pair of petrified testicles was irrelevant. Merely the fact that the name had not been used in subsequent literature meant that it could be removed from competition for priority, because the ICZN states that if a name has never been considered valid after 1899, it can be made a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot;, an invalid &quot;forgotten name&quot;.

In 1993, after the death of Halstead, his friend William A.S. Sarjeant submitted a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to formally suppress the name &quot;Scrotum&quot; in favour of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. He wrote that the supposed junior synonym &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot; should be made a conserved name to ensure its priority. However, the Executive Secretary of the ICZN at the time, Philip K. Tubbs, did not consider the petition to be admissible, concluding that the term &quot;Scrotum humanum&quot;, published merely as a label for an illustration, did not constitute the valid creation of a new name, and stated that there was no evidence it was ever intended as such. Furthermore, the partial femur was too incomplete to definitely be referred to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and not a different, contemporary theropod.

=== Buckland&#x27;s research ===
During the last part of the eighteenth century, the number of fossils in British collections quickly increased. According to a hypothesis published by science historian Robert Gunther in 1925, among them was a partial lower jaw of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. It was discovered about underground in a Stonesfield Slate mine during the early 1790s and was acquired in October 1797 by Christopher Pegge for 10s.6d. and added to the collection of the Anatomy School of Christ Church, Oxford.

In the early nineteenth century, more discoveries were made. In 1815, John Kidd reported the find of bones of giant tetrapods, again at the Stonesfield quarry. The layers there are currently considered part of the Taynton Limestone Formation, dating to the mid-Bathonian stage of the Jurassic Period. The bones were apparently acquired by William Buckland, Professor of Geology at the University of Oxford and dean of Christ Church. Buckland also studied a lower jaw, according to Gunther the one bought by Pegge. Buckland did not know to what animal the bones belonged but, in 1818, after the Napoleonic Wars, the French comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier visited Buckland in Oxford and realized that they were those of a giant lizard-like creature. Buckland further studied the remains with his friend William Conybeare who in 1821 referred to them as the &quot;Huge Lizard&quot;. In 1822 Buckland and Conybeare, in a joint article to be included in Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Ossemens&quot;, intended to provide scientific names for both gigantic lizard-like creatures known at the time: the remains found near Maastricht would be named &quot;Mosasaurus&quot; – then seen as a land-dwelling animal – while for the British lizard Conybeare had devised the name &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, from the Greek μέγας, &quot;megas&quot;, &quot;large&quot;. That year a publication failed to occur, but the physician James Parkinson already in 1822 announced the name &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, illustrating one of the teeth and revealing the creature was 40 feet long and eight feet high. It is generally considered that the name in 1822 was still a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; (&quot;naked name&quot;). Buckland, urged on by an impatient Cuvier, continued to work on the subject during 1823, letting his later wife Mary Morland provide drawings of the bones, that were to be the basis of illustrating lithographies. Finally, on 20 February 1824, during the same meeting of the Geological Society of London in which Conybeare described a very complete specimen of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, Buckland formally announced &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. The descriptions of the bones in the &quot;Transactions of the Geological Society&quot;, in 1824, constitute a valid publication of the name. &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was the first non-avian dinosaur genus named; the first of which the remains had with certainty been scientifically described was &quot;Streptospondylus&quot;, in 1808 by Cuvier.

By 1824, the material available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, a piece of a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thigh bone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles - and he placed it in the new genus &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal 12 meters long in life.

=== Etymology ===
Buckland had not provided a specific name, as was not uncommon in the early nineteenth century, when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, &quot;Megalosaurus conybeari&quot;, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot;. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid binomial name, &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot;. Until recently, the form &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandi&quot; was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original &quot;M. bucklandii&quot; has priority.

=== Early reconstructions ===
The first reconstruction was given by Buckland himself. He considered &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; to be a quadruped. He thought it was an &quot;amphibian&quot;, i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thigh bone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier&#x27;s size estimate that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; would have been 40 feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thigh bone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, or at least some iguanodontid, but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; also. Even taking into account the effects of allometry, heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; at 60 to 70 feet. The existence of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; posed some problems for Christian orthodoxy, which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through Original Sin, which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a pre-Adamitic phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot; that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; had played a beneficial role in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, &quot;to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering&quot;.

Around 1840, it became fashionable in England to espouse the concept of the transmutation of species as part of a general progressive development through time, as expressed in the work of Robert Chambers. In reaction, on 2 August 1841 Richard Owen during a lecture to the British Association for the Advancement of Science claimed that certain prehistoric reptilian groups had already attained the organisational level of present mammals, implying there had been no progress. Owen presented three examples of such higher level reptiles: &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. For these, the &quot;lizard model&quot; was entirely abandoned: they would have had an upright stance and a high metabolism. This also meant that earlier size estimates had been exaggerated. By simply adding the known length of the vertebrae, instead of extrapolating from a lizard, Owen arrived at a total body length for &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; of 30 feet. In the printed version of the lecture published in 1842, Owen united the three reptiles into a separate group: the Dinosauria. &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was thus one of the three original dinosaurs.

In 1852, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build a life-sized concrete model of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; for the exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked under the direction of Owen and the statue reflected Owen&#x27;s ideas that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s. Today, they are seen as a separate genus &quot;Becklespinax&quot;, but Owen referred them to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. The models at the exhibition created a general public awareness for the first time, at least in England, that ancient reptiles had existed.

The presumption that carnivorous dinosaurs, like &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, were quadrupeds was first challenged by the find of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; in 1859. That, however, was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of &quot;Eustreptospondylus&quot; was discovered – the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; bones, held by recesses in cardboard sheets, in a more or less natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.

=== Later finds of &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot; ===
The quarries at Stonesfield, which were worked until 1911, continued to produce &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot; fossils, mostly single bones from the pelvis and hindlimbs. Vertebrae and skull bones are rare. In 2010, Roger Benson counted a total of 103 specimens from the Stonesfield Slate, from a minimum of seven individuals. It has been contentious whether this material represents just a single taxon. In 2004, Julia Day and Paul Barrett claimed that there were two morphotypes present, based on small differences in the thighbones. In 2008 Benson favoured this idea, but in 2010 concluded the differences were illusory. A maxilla fragment, specimen OUM J13506, was, in 1869 assigned, by Thomas Huxley, to &quot;M. bucklandii&quot;. In 1992 Robert Thomas Bakker claimed it represented a member of the Sinraptoridae; in 2007, Darren Naish thought it was a separate species belonging to the Abelisauroidea. In 2010, Benson pointed out that the fragment was basically indistinguishable from other known &quot;M. bucklandii&quot; maxillae, to which it had in fact not been compared by the other authors.

Apart from the finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds referred remains to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; that had been found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about 30 single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot;, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with &quot;M. bucklandii&quot; among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.

Sometimes trace fossils have been referred to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; or to the ichnogenus &quot;Megalosauripus&quot;. In 1997, a famous group of fossilized footprints (ichnites) was found in a limestone quarry at Ardley, 20 kilometers northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and possibly also some left by &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot;.
In 2024 five more sets of tracks were discovered at a nearby Bicester quarry, with one of them showing clear features of large tridactyl theropod feet distinctive of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;.

Finds from sites outside England, especially in France, have in the nineteenth and twentieth century been referred to &quot;M. bucklandii&quot;. In 2010 Benson considered these as either clearly different or too fragmentary to establish an identity.

== Description ==
Since the first finds, many other &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; bones have been recovered; however, no complete skeleton has yet been found. Therefore, the details of its physical appearance cannot be certain. However, a full osteology of all known material was published in 2010 by Benson.

=== Size and general build ===
Traditionally, most texts, following Owen&#x27;s estimate of 1841, give a body length of 30 feet or nine meters for &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. The lack of an articulated dorsal vertebral series makes it difficult to determine an exact size. David Bruce Norman in 1984 thought &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was seven to eight meters long. Gregory S. Paul in 1988 estimated the weight tentatively at 1.1 tons, given a thigh bone 76 centimeters long. The trend in the early twenty-first century to limit the material to the lectotype inspired even lower estimates, disregarding outliers of uncertain identity. Paul in 2010 estimated the size of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; at in length and . However, the same year Benson claimed that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, though medium-sized, was still among the largest of Middle Jurassic theropods. Specimen NHMUK PV OR 31806, a thigh bone 803 millimeters long, would indicate a body weight of 943 kilograms, using the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson - which method, optimized for mammals, tends to underestimate theropod masses by at least a third. Furthermore, thigh bone specimen OUM J13561 has a length of about 86 centimeters.
In general, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; had the typical build of a large theropod. It was bipedal, the horizontal torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, a close relative.

=== Skull and lower jaws ===
The skull of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; is poorly known. The discovered skull elements are generally rather large in relation to the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the &quot;fenestra maxillaris&quot;. The maxilla bears 13 teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimeters. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear 18 to 20 &quot;denticula&quot; per centimeter. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13-14/13-14. The jugal bone is pneumatized, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.

The lower jaw is rather robust. It is also straight in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the mandibula, were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired to have been the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably 13 or 14, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most 11 tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by &quot;Piatnitzkysaurus&quot;. The surangular has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a &quot;foramen surangulare posterior&quot;, but a second &quot;foramen surangulare anterior&quot; to the front of it is lacking.

=== Vertebral column ===
Although the exact numbers are unknown, the vertebral column of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was probably divided into 10 neck vertebrae, 13 dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and 50 to 60 tail vertebrae, as is common for basal Tetanurae.

The Stonesfield Slate material contains no neck vertebrae; but a single broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen NHMUK PV R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatized, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatized. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen NHMUK PV R9677, suggests the presence of a crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatized but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing more than half of the total vertebral height.

=== Appendicular skeleton ===
The shoulderblade or scapula is short and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves slightly to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about mid-length where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned, forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes about half of the shoulder joint, which is orientated obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.

The humerus is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimeters. Its shaft circumference equals about half of the total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the &quot;Musculus pectoralis major&quot; and the &quot;Musculus deltoideus&quot;. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, NHMUK PV OR 36585, has a length of 232 millimeters and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimeters. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the &quot;Musculus triceps brachii&quot;. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.

In the pelvis, the ilium is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the &quot;Musculus iliofemoralis&quot;, the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the &quot;Musculus caudofemoralis brevis&quot;. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus can be seen as a separate &quot;medial blade&quot; that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable &quot;foot&quot; with a convex lower profile.

The thigh bone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thigh bone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or &quot;tibia&quot;, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.

=== Diagnosis ===
For decades after its discovery, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur. As a result, it began to function as a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;, and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus. This slowly changed during the 20th century, when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England. Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, researchers such as Ronan Allain and Dan Chure suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several, possibly not directly related, species of theropod dinosaur. Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis, and the genus &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and species &quot;M. bucklandii&quot; became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype, the dentary of the lower jaw. Furthermore, several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; from its relatives, which would mean the genus were a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. However, a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008, and several related analyses published in subsequent years, overturned the previous consensus by identifying several autapomorphies, or unique distinguishing characteristics, in the lower jaw that could be used to separate &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; from other megalosaurids.

Various distinguishing traits of the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, of the lower jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious to assume that the Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed in other parts of the skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.

== Phylogeny ==
In 1824, Buckland assigned &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; to the Sauria, assuming within the Sauria a close affinity with modern lizards, more than with crocodiles. In 1842, Owen made &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; one of the first three genera placed in the Dinosauria. In 1850, Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte coined a separate family Megalosauridae with &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; as the type genus. For a long time, the precise relationships of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; remained vague. It was seen as a &quot;primitive&quot; member of the Carnosauria, the group in which most large theropods were united.

In the late 20th century the new method of cladistics allowed for the first time to exactly calculate how closely various taxa were related to each other. In 2012, Matthew Carrano &quot;et al.&quot; showed that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was the sister species of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; within the Megalosaurinae, giving this cladogram:

== Paleobiology ==
&quot;Megalosaurus&quot; lived in what is now Europe during the Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic (~166-168 million years ago). Repeated descriptions during the nineteenth and early twentieth century of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; hunting &quot;Iguanodon&quot; (another of the earliest dinosaurs named) through the forests that then covered the continent are now known to be inaccurate, because &quot;Iguanodon&quot; skeletons are found in much younger Early Cretaceous formations. The only specimens belonging to &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot; are from the Lower/Middle Bathonian of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. No material from outside the Bathonian formations of England can be referred to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. Other roughly contemporaneous dinosaur species known from the Bathonian of Britain include the theropods &quot;Cruxicheiros&quot; (a large sized taxon), &quot;Iliosuchus&quot; (a dubious taxon only known from fragmentary remains), the small tyrannosauroid &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot;, and other indeterminate theropods known from teeth, suggested to include dromaeosaurs, troodontids, and therizinosaurs, indeterminate ornithischians primarily known from teeth, including heterodontosaurids, stegosaurs, and ankylosaurs, and the sauropods &quot;Cardiodon&quot; (only known from teeth) and &quot;Cetiosaurus.&quot; &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; may have hunted stegosaurs and sauropods. 

Benson in 2010 concluded from its size and common distribution that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was the apex predator of its habitat. He saw the absence of &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; on the French Armorican Massif as an indication that &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; too did not live on that island and was limited to the London-Brabant Massif, a tectonic high that during this period formed an island landmass including parts of southern Britain and adjacent areas of northern France, the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, suggested to be comparable in size to Cuba with an area of around . It has been questioned why the dinosaurs of the island did not experience insular dwarfism, as would be expected for an island of this size. A possible explanation for this is that the island remained ecologically connected to the much larger landmass comprising northern Britain (the Scottish Massif), the Fennoscandian Shield and the now submerged region in the North Sea between them. Plant fossils from the Taynton Limestone Formation from which many &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; fossils originate, representing the nearshore vegetation are largely dominated by conifers (including the living family Araucariaceae and the extinct family Cheirolepidiaceae) as well as the extinct seed plant group Bennettitales, representing a probably seasonally dry environment including mangroves.

=== Paleopathology ===
A &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; rib figured in 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a pathological swollen spot near the base of its capitular process. The swollen spot appears to have been caused by a healed fracture and is located at the point where it would have articulated with its vertebra.

== Species and synonyms ==
During the later nineteenth century, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was seen as the typical carnivorous dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; as the default generic name.

=== Species named in the 19th century ===

In 1857, Joseph Leidy renamed &quot;Deinodon horridus&quot; (Leidy, 1856) into &quot;Megalosaurus horridus&quot;, the &quot;frightening one&quot;, a genus based on teeth. In 1858, Friedrich August Quenstedt named &quot;Megalosaurus cloacinus&quot;, based on a probable Late Triassic theropod tooth found near Bebenhausen, specimen SMNH 52457. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. In 1869 Eugène Eudes-Deslongchamps named &quot;Megalosaurus insignis&quot;, the &quot;significant&quot;, based on a theropod tooth found near La Hève in Normandy that was 12 centimeters long, a third longer than the teeth of &quot;M. bucklandii&quot;. The name at first remained a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, but a description was provided, in 1870, by Gustave Lennier. Today, it is considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda, the specimen having in 1944 been destroyed by a bombardment. In 1870, Jean-Baptiste Greppin named &quot;Megalosaurus meriani&quot; based on specimen MH 350, a premaxillary tooth found near Moutier and part of the collection of Peter Merian. Today, this is either referred to &quot;Amanzia&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; or seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Ceratosauria. In 1871, Emanuel Bunzel named remains found near Schnaitheim &quot;Megalosaurus schnaitheimi&quot;. It is a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, the fossils possibly belonging to &quot;Dakosaurus maximus&quot;. In 1876, J. Henry, a science teacher at Besançon, in a published dissertation named four Late Triassic possible dinosaur teeth found near Moissey &quot;Megalosaurus obtusus&quot;, &quot;the blunt one&quot;. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, perhaps a theropod or some indeterminate predatory archosaur. In 1881, Harry Govier Seeley named two possible theropod teeth found in Austria &quot;Megalosaurus pannoniensis&quot;. The specific name refers to Pannonia. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, possibly an indeterminate member of the Dromaeosauridae or Tyrannosauroidea. In 1883, Seeley named &quot;Megalosaurus bredai&quot;, based on a thigh bone, specimen NHMUK PV OR 42997 found near Maastricht, the Netherlands. The specific name honours Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda. In 1932, this was made a separate genus &quot;Betasuchus&quot; by Friedrich von Huene.

In 1882, Henri-Émile Sauvage named remains found at Louppy-le-Château, teeth and vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous, &quot;Megalosaurus superbus&quot;, &quot;the proud one&quot;. In 1923, this became the genus &quot;Erectopus&quot;. In 1884/1885, Wilhelm Barnim Dames, based on specimen UM 84, a tooth from the Early Cretaceous, named &quot;Megalosaurus dunkeri&quot;, the specific name honouring Wilhelm Dunker. In 1923, this was made a separate genus &quot;Altispinax&quot;. In 1885, Joseph Henri Ferdinand Douvillé renamed &quot;Dakosaurus gracilis&quot; Quenstedt 1885 into &quot;Megalosaurus gracilis&quot;. Today the renaming is generally rejected. In 1889, Richard Lydekker named &quot;Megalosaurus oweni&quot;, the specific name honouring Owen, based on a series of metatarsals from the Early Cretaceous, specimen BMNH R?2556?. In 1991, this was made a separate genus &quot;Valdoraptor&quot;. In 1892, Edward Drinker Cope renamed &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot; Marsh 1884 into &quot;Megalosaurus nasicornis&quot;. This had been largely motivated by a desire to annoy his rival Othniel Charles Marsh and the name has found no acceptance. In 1896, Charles Jean Julien Depéret named &quot;Megalosaurus crenatissimus&quot;, &quot;the much crenelated&quot;, based on remains from the Late Cretaceous found in Madagascar. In 1955 this was made a separate genus &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;. The generic name &quot;Laelaps&quot;, used by Cope to denote a theropod, had been preoccupied by a mite. Marsh had therefore provided the replacement name &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot;, but Henry Fairfield Osborn, a partisan of Cope, rejected this replacement and thus in 1898 renamed &quot;Laelaps aquilunguis&quot; Cope 1866 into &quot;Megalosaurus aquilunguis&quot;.

=== Species named in the 20th century ===
In 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed &quot;Laelaps trihedrodon&quot; Cope 1877 into &quot;Megalosaurus trihedrodon&quot;. In the same publication Nopcsa renamed &quot;Poekilopleuron valens&quot; Leidy 1870 into &quot;Megalosaurus valens&quot;; this probably represents fossil material of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. In 1902, Nopcsa named &quot;Megalosaurus hungaricus&quot; based on two teeth found in Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The specimens, MAFI ob. 3106, were later lost. It represents an indeterminate theropod. In 1903, Louis Dollo named &quot;Megalosaurus lonzeensis&quot; based on a manual claw found near Lonzee in Belgium. He had first reported this claw in 1883, and as a result some sources by mistake indicate this year as the date of the naming. It perhaps represents a member of the Noasauridae, or an indeterminate member of the Coelurosauria. In 1907 or 1908, von Huene renamed &quot;Streptospondylus cuvieri&quot;, based on a presently lost partial vertebra, into &quot;Megalosaurus cuvieri&quot;. This is today seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 1909, Richard Lydekker named &quot;Megalosaurus woodwardi&quot;, based on a maxilla with tooth, specimen NHMUK PV OR 41352. This is today seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.

In 1910, Arthur Smith Woodward named &quot;Megalosaurus bradleyi&quot; based on a skull from the Middle Jurassic, the specific name honouring the collector F. Lewis Bradley. In 1926, this was made a separate genus &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot;. In 1920, Werner Janensch named &quot;Megalosaurus ingens&quot;, &quot;the enormous&quot;, based on specimen MB R 1050, a 12 centimeter long tooth from German East Africa. It possibly represents a large member of the Carcharodontosauridae; Carrano e.a. saw it as an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. &quot;M. ingens&quot; is now seen as a specimen of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. In 1923, von Huene renamed &quot;Poekilopleuron bucklandii&quot; Eudes-Deslongchamps 1838 into &quot;Megalosaurus poikilopleuron&quot;. Today, the genus &quot;Poekilopleuron&quot; is generally seen as valid. In the same publication, von Huene named two additional &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; species. The first was &quot;Megalosaurus parkeri&quot;, its specific name honouring William Kitchen Parker and based on a pelvis, leg bones and vertebrae from the Late Cretaceous. This was made the separate genus &quot;Metriacanthosaurus&quot; in 1964. The second was &quot;Megalosaurus nethercombensis&quot;, named after its provenance from Nethercombe and based on two dentaries, leg bones, a pelvis and vertebrae from the Middle Jurassic, which von Huene himself in 1932 made the separate genus &quot;Magnosaurus&quot;. In 1925, Depéret, based on two teeth from Algeria, named &quot;Megalosaurus saharicus&quot;. In 1931/1932 this was made the separate genus &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;. In 1956 von Huene by mistake named the same species as &quot;Megalosaurus africanus&quot;, intending to base it on remains from Morocco but referring the Algerian teeth; this implies that &quot;M. africanus&quot; is a junior objective synonym of &quot;M. saharicus&quot;. In 1926, von Huene named &quot;Megalosaurus lydekkeri&quot;, its specific name honouring Richard Lydekker, based on NHMUK OR 41352, i.e. the same specimen that had already been made the holotype of &quot;M. woodwardi&quot; (Lydekker, 1909). This implies that &quot;M. lydekkeri&quot; is a junior objective synonym of &quot;M. woodwardi&quot;. It is likewise seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. 

In the same publication von Huene named &quot;Megalosaurus terquemi&quot; based on three teeth found near Hettingen, its specific name honouring Olry Terquem. It is seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, the fossil material probably representing some member of the Phytosauria or some other archosaur. In 1932, a work by von Huene mentioned a &quot;Megalosaurus (Magnosaurus) woodwardi&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Magnosaurus woodwardi&quot; named in the same book. Its type specimen is differing from the earlier &quot;Megalosaurus woodwardi&quot; (Lydekker, 1909), the two names are not synonyms. In 1954 Samuel Welles named &quot;Megalosaurus wetherilli&quot;. This species is exceptional in being based on a rather complete skeleton, found in Arizona, from the Early Jurassic. Its specific name honours John Wetherill. In 1970, Welles made this the separate genus &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. In 1955, Albert-Félix de Lapparent named &quot;Megalosaurus mersensis&quot; based on a series of 23 vertebrae found near Tizi n&#x27;Juillerh in a layer of the El Mers Formation of Morocco. This probably represents a member of the Mesosuchia. In 1956, Alfred Sherwood Romer renamed &quot;Aggiosaurus nicaeensis&quot; Ambayrac 1913, based on a lower jaw found near Nice, on the authority of von Huene into &quot;Megalosaurus nicaeensis&quot;. Originally it had been considered to be some crocodilian; present opinion confirms this. In 1957, de Lapparent named &quot;Megalosaurus pombali&quot; based on three teeth found near Pombal in the Jurassic of Portugal. Today it is seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.

In 1965, Oskar Kuhn renamed &quot;Zanclodon silesiacus&quot; Jaekel 1910 into &quot;Megalosaurus? silesiacus&quot;. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; based on the tooth of some indeterminate predatory Triassic archosaur, found in Silesia, perhaps a theropod. In 1966, Guillermo del Corro named &quot;Megalosaurus inexpectatus&quot;, named &quot;the unexpected&quot; as it was discovered on a sauropod site with remains of &quot;Chubutisaurus&quot;, based on specimen MACN 18.172, a tooth found in Argentina. It might represent a member of the Carcharodontosauridae. In 1970, Rodney Steel named two &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; species. Firstly, he renamed &quot;Iliosuchus incognitus&quot; Huene 1932 into &quot;Megalosaurus incognitus&quot;. Secondly, he renamed &quot;Nuthetes destructor&quot; Owen 1854 into &quot;Megalosaurus destructor&quot;. Both genera are today seen as not identical to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. Michael Waldman in 1974 renamed &quot;Sarcosaurus andrewsi&quot; Huene 1932 into &quot;Megalosaurus andrewsi&quot;. Indeed, &quot;Sarcosaurus andrewsi&quot; is today by some scientists not seen as directly related to the type species of &quot;Sarcosaurus&quot;: &quot;Sarcosaurus woodi&quot;. In the same publication Waldman named &quot;Megalosaurus hesperis&quot;, &quot;the western one&quot;, based on skull fragments from the Middle Jurassic. In 2008 this was made the separate genus &quot;Duriavenator&quot;. Del Corro in 1974 named &quot;Megalosaurus chubutensis&quot;, based on specimen MACN 18.189, a tooth found in Chubut Province. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, a possible carcharodontosaurid, or a very large abelisaurid.

In 1985, Zhao Xijin named two &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; species found in Tibet. He had earlier mentioned these species in an unpublished dissertation of 1983, implying they initially were invalid &quot;nomina ex dissertatione&quot;. However, his 1985 publication did not contain descriptions so the names are still &quot;nomina nuda&quot;. The first species was &quot;Megalosaurus &quot;&quot;dapukaensis&quot;, named for the Dapuka Group. It was, in the second edition of &quot;The Dinosauria&quot;, by mistake spelled as &quot;Megalosaurus cachuensis&quot;. The second species was &quot;Megalosaurus &quot;&quot;tibetensis&quot;. In 1987/1988, Monique Vianey-Liaud renamed &quot;Massospondylus rawesi&quot; (Lydekker, 1890), based on specimen NHMUK R4190, a tooth from the Maastrichtian of India, into &quot;Megalosaurus rawesi&quot;. This is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, a possible member of the Abelisauridae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul renamed &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot; Galton &amp; Jensen 1979 into &quot;Megalosaurus tanneri&quot;. The change has found no acceptance. In 1973, Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky had renamed &quot;Poekilopleuron schmidti&quot; Kiprijanow 1883 into a &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; sp. However, as it is formally impossible to change a named species into an unnamed one, George Olshevsky in 1991 used the new combination &quot;Megalosaurus schmidti&quot;. It is a chimaera. In 1993, Ernst Probst and Raymund Windolf by mistake renamed &quot;Plateosaurus ornatus&quot; Huene 1905 into &quot;Megalosaurus ornatus&quot; by mentioning the latter name in a species list. This can be seen as a &quot;nomen vanum&quot;. The same publication listed the ichnospecies &quot;Megalosauropus teutonicus&quot; Kaever &amp; Lapparent 1974 as a &quot;Megalosaurus teutonicus&quot;. In 1997, Windolf renamed &quot;Saurocephalus monasterii&quot; Münster 1846, based on a tooth found near Hannover, into &quot;Megalosaurus monasterii&quot;. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda. In 1998, Peter Malcolm Galton renamed &quot;Zanclodon cambrensis&quot; Newton 1899, based on a left lower jaw, specimen BGS 6532 found at Bridgend, into ?&quot;Megalosaurus cambrensis&quot; because it was not a basal sauropodomorph. It is a senior synonym of &quot;Gressylosaurus cambrensis&quot; Olshevsky 1991. The specific name refers to Cambria, the Latin name of Wales. It probably represents a member of the Coelophysoidea, or some other predatory archosaur.

=== Species list ===
The complex naming history can be summarized in a formal species list. The naming authors are directly mentioned behind the name. If the name has been changed, they are placed in parentheses and the authors of the changed name are mentioned behind them. The list also indicates whether a name has been insufficiently described (&quot;nomen nudum&quot;), is not taxonomically identifiable at the generic level (&quot;nomen dubium&quot;), or fallen out of use (&quot;nomen oblitum&quot;). Reclassifications under a different genus are mentioned behind the &quot;=&quot; sign; if the reclassification is today considered valid, it is listed under Reassigned species.

<doc id="513911" wikidata="Q629539" url="?curid=513911" title="NHIndustries NH90">
<text>The NHIndustries NH90 is a European medium-sized, twin-engine, multirole military helicopter. It was the first production helicopter to feature entirely fly-by-wire flight controls. There is extensive use of composite materials and electronic sensors. The helicopter has two main versions, the TTH oriented towards land applications (able to carry up to 20 troops) and the NFH, oriented towards naval use and focused on such tasks as ASW and marine SAR. Over 500 have been produced for a dozen users, and it remains in production.

The NH90 was developed in response to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) requirements for a battlefield helicopter which would also be capable of being operated in naval environments. It was developed and is manufactured by NHIndustries, a collaborative company owned by Airbus Helicopters (formally Eurocopter), Leonardo (formerly AgustaWestland), and Fokker Aerostructures. The first prototype conducted its maiden flight in December 1995; the type first entered operational service in 2007. As of June 2022, the NH90 logged 327,053 flight hours in the armed forces of thirteen countries. It is an advanced but high maintenance military helicopter employed by a dozen countries in two major versions. It has a naval version that can land on ships and is used for sea rescue and submarine warfare, and an army version that has been used for transporting cargo, people, medivac, and special operations.

The NH90 has two main variants: the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) for army use and the navalised NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH); each customer typically has various alterations and customizations made to their own NH90 fleets, such as different weapons, sensors, and cabin arrangements, to meet their own specific requirements. In addition, local construction of airframes was accommodated in many cases, giving participants in the program a chance to develop experience in construction. However, despite many advanced features, there have been a series of complaints about the overall experience, including delays in delivery, high maintenance, software issues, and durability, leading to the early retirement of some fleets. Nevertheless, it has served in increasing numbers and roles in the 2010s, taking on naval search and rescue, ASW, troop transport, special operations, various resupply and disaster relief, and medical evacuation. In several cases, NH90 variants can be quite specialized towards a certain role.

Since its introduction into service, the NH90 has suffered several technical issues, which have delayed active deployment of the type by some operators. It is a key next-generation helicopter for many NATO countries: some have opted to stick with the type while others have chosen to discontinue operations. In 2022, Norway terminated the program and demanded a full refund. Australia withdrew the type in 2023, well ahead of the planned retirement date of 2037. Currently in the mid-2020s, a dozen countries continue to use the NH90, while additional orders and improvements equate to ongoing and widespread use of the type. Efforts are ongoing to increase roles, upgrades, and increase the service life and ease of maintenance.

==Development==
===Origins===
In 1985, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom teamed to develop a NATO battlefield transport and anti-ship/anti-submarine helicopter for the 1990s. The United Kingdom left the team in 1987. On 1 September 1992, NHIndustries signed an NH90 design-and-development contract with NAHEMA (NATO Helicopter Management Agency). This agency represented the four participating states: France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Portugal later joined the agency in June 2001. Design work on the helicopter started in 1993. The first prototype, PT1, made the type&#x27;s first flight on 18 December 1995. The second prototype, PT2, first flew on 19 March 1997 and the third prototype, PT3, on 27 November 1998. On 12 December 2002, PT3 became the first helicopter to fly exclusively with fly-by-wire controls after the removal of mechanical back-up controls.

The NH90 was developed into two main variants: the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) and the NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH). These two main variants share about 75% commonality with each other. Many of the operators have requested specific configurations to their own helicopter fleets, thus each country&#x27;s NH90 is effectively customized to the end-user&#x27;s requirements. During the development phase of the programme in the 1990s, both technical and funding problems were experienced. In June 2000, the partner states placed a large production order, worth US$8.6 billion, for a total of 366 helicopters. Additional orders have since followed from customers in Europe, Asia, and Australia. By April 2013, a total of 529 NH90s of all variants were on order by various customers. As of early 2023, there were 597 on order, and the 500th airframe was delivered at that time.

===Production===
The NH90 was initially intended to be produced at three exporting final assembly lines (FAL): Cascina Costa in Italy for AgustaWestland, Marignane in France and Donauwörth in Germany for Airbus Helicopters. The Nordic and Australian contracts stipulated production locally (the Nordic ones at Patria in Finland and the Australian ones in Brisbane). Spain has a final assembly line at Albacete. The Marignane assembly line can reportedly complete up to 22 NH90s per year.

Major components are produced by each of the shareholding companies:
* Airbus Helicopters France 31.25% (Engines, rotors, electrical system, flight control, and the core avionics systems)
* Airbus Helicopters Deutschland 31.25% (Forward and center fuselage, fuel system, communications, and avionics control systems)
* Fokker 5.5% (Tail structure, doors, sponsons, landing gear, and the intermediate gearbox)
* AgustaWestland 32% (Rear fuselage, main gearbox, hydraulic system, automatic flight control and plant management systems, power plant, and the NFH mission system)
Items built by the shareholding companies are then distributed to the six locations for assembly and flight test (Marignane, France; Tessera, Italy; Donauwörth, Germany; Halli, Finland; and Brisbane, Australia).

In late 2006, the German Army, the first customer to receive production aircraft, accepted delivery of its first NH90 TTH. In April 2010, the Royal Netherlands Navy was the first customer to receive the navalised NH90 NFH variant. In June 2014, the consortium announced that it had completed delivery of the 200th NH90; at that point, the backlog of orders was reported as reaching out to 2020. In order to alleviate delays and reduce the complexity of manufacturing a large number of NH90 variants, NHIndustries (NHI) proposed the adoption of a simplified baseline airframe which could be configured to the individual customer&#x27;s requirements. Between 2004 and 2016, the production lead times for the NH90 had reduced from 18 months to 7.5 months.

In 2014, worldwide production of the NH90 peaked at 53 helicopters per year. In October 2015, the delivery of the 250th NH90 was formally accepted by the Italian Army. In 2015, the rate of NH90 production declined, reportedly due to countries choosing to delay their orders and some contracts having been fulfilled; in 2016, the Finnish final assembly line became the first to close with its orders completed. In 2023, the 500th NH90 was delivered to the French Army, from the Marignane facility.

Although no US order has been taken, it has been noted that the NH90 could be produced at Airbus&#x27; facility in Mississippi, US. Although a civilian version has not been produced, the NH90 was designed from the start to potentially meet FAA certification requirements; it has been speculated that the high-cabin variant already in production would be typical of passenger rotorcraft. If produced, it would fit between the AS365 Dauphin and the AS322 Super Puma in Airbus&#x27; product line. NHI studied making a civilian version of the NH90 in 2004.

As of March 2024, 515 airframes had been delivered, including 24 different variants used by 14 countries.

===Performance concerns===

In 2010, German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; reported that German Army experts had concerns that the helicopter was not yet ready for the transportation of combat troops. They stated that the seats were rated for only 110 kg (240 lb), not considered enough for a fully equipped soldier. Heavy infantry weapons could not be adequately secured and the cabin floor was prone to damage, citing an anecdote of damage caused by footwear. The helicopter could only land on firm ground, with obstacles not exceeding 16 cm (6.3 in). Troops carrying full equipment could not use the rear ramp due to weight-limitations placed on it. Adding a door machine gun was not possible due to space taken by troop ingress and egress; there was also no provision for fast roping or paratrooper equipment. In response, the German Defense Ministry proclaimed that this article referred to a prototype, not to the production model; the specifications for which were not even finalised at the time. The prototype evaluation and its results were described as a normal procedure in an ongoing design process.

In November 2011, the MRH-90 program was placed on the Australian Department of Defence&#x27;s &quot;Projects of Concern&quot; list. The most serious problem identified by a diagnostic review, which caused a brief grounding in 2010, is compressor blade rubbing caused by the bending of a spool in the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engine due to uneven cooling after shutdown. Other problems identified include failure of transmission oil cooler fans, windscreen cracking, an inertial navigation system that is slow to align, and the weakness of the cabin floor to withstand the impact of soldiers&#x27; boots – a problem also encountered in German service.

In March 2014, it was announced that a Dutch NH90 had suffered higher than expected fuselage wear and corrosion following an extended deployment at sea; analysis by the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory attributed the corrosion to design and assembly flaws. However, the fleet was not grounded. In response, NHIndustries launched a corrosion prevention programme and enacted several design modifications. In December 2014, Dutch NH90 deliveries, which had been temporarily halted earlier in the year, restarted after the majority of identified points were addressed and an agreement was made by the manufacturer to bear the cost of developing modifications, repairs, and preventive measures against corrosion.

==== Operational costs ====
Ron Mark, New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Spokesperson for Defence put out a press release in 2017 criticising the NH90&#x27;s cost, citing the statistics of 2015: &quot;The NH90s cost $1,182 an hour to fly and that is 2.5 times more expensive than the Iroquois they replaced. They&#x27;re also unreliable, chewing through $3.3 million worth of spares in just two years.&quot;

The operating cost of a NH90 HCV (High Cabin Version) was reported in Swedish media during 2018 as at least 200,000 SEK (later specified as 242,000 SEK in the McKinnley report, ordered by the Swedish defence ministry) per hour flown, or about US$28,000. In contrast, the Hkp 16, MH-60 Blackhawks in Swedish service had a cost of 40,000 SEK per hour, something that sparked a heated debate not least since it was revealed that the defence minister had demanded that the purchase had to be a joint procurement with the other Nordic countries which in turn excluded all other contenders. (see Nordic Standard Helicopter Program) Debate among defence bloggers commenced when it was revealed that much of these costs was the result of the accounting practices forced upon the Swedish defence forces; the purchase cost and annual services had been factored in, meaning that the cost per hour increases the less flight time per year the fleet gets. In this debate, it was also pointed out that the Finnish defence had budgeted CPFH to €15,900 in 2017, which the year after had been lowered to €10,000.

In 2020, the Belgian ministry of defence announced a 40% cut to the NH90&#x27;s annual flight time, stating that, while the Westland Sea Kings retired in 2019 had a cost per flight hour of around €5,000, the NH90 was more than double that at €12,000. per hour. Additionally, the reliability was impacted by a lack of service personnel to keep the fleet flightworthy.

The Australian Parliament released their report &quot;MRH-90 Taipan helicopter: a quick guide&quot; in 2021, detailing problems with the NH90 since 2005 and why they will be replaced. There the CPFH is listed as &quot;the helicopter&#x27;s estimated operating costs were $30,000 to $40,000 per hour, which is &#x27;higher than those combat aircraft with sophisticated weapons and sensor systems&#x27; (p. 72). More recently, the cost has increased to $50,000 per hour.&quot;

Axel Aloccio, head of NHI since mid-September 2022, believes that most problems stem from the teething issues of a new system that take a few years of service to find and correct, and that most are either solved or will be addressed with the transformation plan called &quot;New Horizon&quot; that Aloccio&#x27;s predecessor, Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, launched. This program of system-wide changes had the aim of 50-60% average global fleet availability by the end of 2022 through better spare part availability and localisation of overhaul services. It also seeks to lower operating costs, the time between maintenance inspections and overhaul for dynamic components have both been raised by 50% in order to keep them synchronized, from 600/1200 flight hours to 900/1800 hours respectively. The Australian fleet retirement is being dismantled for spare parts, which it is hoped will increase the supply of spare parts for other users.

==Design==

The NH90 was designed to fulfill a NATO staff requirement for a multi-role, medium-sized military helicopter for both land and maritime operations. According to Flight International, the NH90 has the distinction of being the first helicopter in the world to be developed in line with NATO requirements. As such, the design of the NH90 meets with multiple national and international standards, including military airworthiness processes in Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands; conformance with FAR 29 and MIL-STDS design standards, as well as DEF-STN 00-970 icing conditions performance and electro-magnetic compatibility. It is produced in two principal variants, the battlefield Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) and the maritime NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH).

One key innovation of the rotorcraft is the four-channel fly-by-wire control system employed; the NH90 is the first helicopter in the world to be equipped with full fly-by-wire flight controls. A four-axis autopilot is also integrated with the fly-by-wire system, as are mission and navigation systems, to enable greater autonomy during operations and reduce pilot workload. The flight envelope of the NH90 is capable of all-weather day-and-night operations, ship-borne operations during high sea states, across a temperature range from −40 °C to +50 °C, and up to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. Power is provided by a pair of turboshaft engines, dependent on customer selection, the NH90 is either fitted with Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 or General Electric CT7-8F powerplants; exhaust gases from the engines are filtered through an infrared suppression system for decreased sensory visibility. The NH90 has three gearboxes including the Main Gearbox (MGB), Intermediate Gearbox (IGB), and a Tail Rotor Gearbox (TGB).

According to Airbus Helicopters, the NH90 possesses the lowest radar signature in its class, principally due to its diamond-shaped composite fuselage.

The NH90 features an advanced composite airframe, designed for ballistic tolerance, a high level of crashworthiness, lower weight, and 30 per cent greater endurance than a metallic counterpart. The four main rotor blades are also composed of composite materials, increasing fatigue strength and lifespan while providing greater damage tolerance. The unobstructed main cabin area is entered either by large sliding doors on either side of the fuselage or via a rear ramp. The cabin is designed to accommodate modular equipment packages to enable the rotorcraft to be rapidly reconfigured, providing for operational flexibility. In a troop-transport capacity, the cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers, or up to 12 stretchers in a medical evacuation role, some light vehicles may also be transported; the main cabin is equipped with environmental control systems and sound proofing measures to improve passenger conditions.

The NH90 can be equipped with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also make use of the Helicopter In-Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment. The NH90 is equipped with emergency floats, which deploy in case of a water landing and are designed to give personnel enough time to exit the helicopter before it sinks.
The NH90 features a range of customizable avionics systems, dependent on customer selection and purpose. On some models, French firm Thales Group provides various parts of the avionics, such as the glass cockpit, full-colour multifunction displays, tactical mission and encrypted communication systems, the TopOwl helmet-mounted sight/display, IFF and autonomous navigation systems, and the electrical power generation system. Other systems include a forward looking infrared (FLIR), weather radar, digital map generation system, enhanced ground proximity warning system, personal locator system, and VHF/UHF/HF tactical radios. In 2015, the NH90 became the first helicopter to receive a laser-based airborne collision avoidance system. Onboard mission systems feature a dual-redundant databus, are compliant with MIL-STD 1553, and are comprehensively managed via sensor fusion functionality. Customer demand for future avionics improvements such as new data links and communication systems, as well as additional electro-optical sensors, has been anticipated by the manufacturer.

NHI&#x27;s long-term plan for the NH90 had reportedly included service life extensions, avionics upgrades, and possibly adding heavier armament for the army versions, such as rockets or guided missiles. In 2020, an upgraded TFRA2 Special Operations version was announced, featuring numerous specialized modifications on the TTH, including extra fuel tanks, twin gun mounts, fast roping from the removable rear door, Helmet Mounted Sight Digital Display, and various enhanced or extra visual sensors with displays for increased situational awareness.

In June 2024, plans were announced for the Block 1 upgrade, which was also called software release 3 (SWR3); called a &quot;roadmap milestone&quot;, this involves an upgrade to NH90 software, weapons systems, and capabilities. &quot;Standard 3&quot; configuration of an NH90 includes stronger landing gear, automatic folding main rotor, 11 tonnes GTOW, enhanced communication and safety features. The first Standard 3 configuration NH90 helicopters were delivered in December 2024.

==Operational history==
===Australia===


In 2004, Australia announced it would order 12 NH90s to supplement its Army&#x27;s aging S-70A Black Hawk helicopters. In June 2006, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) announced plans to replace its UH-60 Black Hawk and Westland Sea King helicopters; a further 34 NH90s were ordered for a total of 46; four were manufactured in Europe while 42 being manufactured locally by Australian Aerospace (an Airbus Helicopters subsidiary) in Brisbane. Its ADF designation and name &quot;MRH-90 Taipan&quot; refers to its use as a &quot;Multi Role Helicopter&quot; and refers to a native species of snake. The first MRH-90 entered service in December 2007 with the Army. Six MRH-90s would be operated by 808 Squadron of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which was reformed in 2011 and recommissioned in 2013. Overall, there were 46 airframes in service, with a 47th kept as a spare.

On 20 April 2010, a MRH-90 suffered a single engine failure near Adelaide, landing safely at RAAF Base Edinburgh. NHIndustries personnel investigated the cause. On 18 May, the ADF announced that the MRH-90 fleet was grounded due to engine issues since the April incident. All MRH-90s used the Rolls-Royce Turbemeca RTM322. The cause of the failure was determined as the compressor blade contacting the engine casing, leading to new preventative inspections; flights resumed in July 2010.

In July 2014, the Australian National Audit Office released a report on the MRH-90, citing procurement errors and development deficiencies delaying final operational capability (FOC), originally set for that month, until April 2019, nearly five years later than planned. NH90s first delivered in 2007 had not yet validated any of the 11 set operational capability milestones, and forced redesigns included bolstered cabin floors and windscreens, rappelling hooks, and door gunner positions; obtaining spare parts and fleet sustainment had also been more costly. The Australian Army was forced to operate its aging S-70A Black Hawks beyond its planned retirement date. Due to the delays, Australia received an additional helicopter for a total of 47. By September 2015, most flaws had reportedly been addressed.

In 2015, the Australian Army decided to delay retiring 20 Black Hawks by four years until the end of 2021 in order to develop a special operations capable MRH-90. This required developing a Fast Roping and Rappelling Extraction System (FRRES) and a gun mount for the cabin door. The Taipan Gun Mount can fit either a M134D minigun or MAG 58 machine gun and when not in use, can be moved into an outward stowed position to provide clearance to enable fast roping and rappelling. In February 2019, the first two of 12 MRH-90s were delivered to the 6th Aviation Regiment. In June 2021, all MRH-90s were temporarily grounded due to lack of maintenance and spare parts which had to be shipped from Europe.

In December 2021, on the same day the older generation of Black Hawks was retired, the Australian Government announced plans to replace the Army&#x27;s MRH-90 fleet with new UH-60M Black Hawks; their retirement date was moved to 2024. In April 2022, the RAN ceased flying their MRH-90s and stored them. In May 2022, the government announced that the RAN&#x27;s six MRH-90s would be replaced with more MH-60R Seahawks; it already operated 24 Seahawks, delivered between 2013 and 2016, alongside the MRH-90.

In March 2023, an Army MRH-90 carrying 10 personnel appeared to malfunction mid-flight while hovering over a Jervis Bay beach at night amid a training exercise, leading to a controlled ditch into the water. All ten personnel survived and the helicopter was towed onto a nearby beach. Following the incident, all MRH-90s were grounded pending an investigation. Early indications pointed to a missing flight software update. The MRH-90 returned to service on 6 April 2023. In July 2023, another MRH-90 crashed at night during Exercise Talisman Sabre off the coast of Hamilton Island, Queensland, resulting in four missing crew members. By early August, the cockpit and human remains were found in a debris field in 40 meters of water, consistent with a catastrophic impact. On 8 August 2023, divers recovered the flight data recorder.

On 29 September 2023, the Australian Government announced that the MRH-90 will not return to ADF service, bringing forward the previously planned retirement date of December 2024. Officials stated the early retirement was not meant to preempt the outcome of the crash investigation, which was still ongoing; the fleet has been grounded since the July 2023 crash. At the time of its grounding, there were 38 MRH-90s in service. Australia filled service gaps created by the grounding, operational pauses, and early retirement by extending the older S-70A&#x27;s service life, by buying additional Chinook helicopters as a stop gap, leasing six AW139, as well as the urgent procurement of a replacement helicopter. The ADF invested about $3.5 billion over two decades in the program. In August 2022, Australia approved the purchase of 40 UH-60M Blackhawks to replace the MRH-90.

===Belgium===
In 2007, Belgium signed on for a firm order of 8 aircraft (4 TTH, 4 NFH) and an option for 2 additional TTH. In September 2012, NHI performed the first flight of the Belgium&#x27;s Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH), which is broadly similar to the French NH90 &quot;Caiman&quot; version. In January 2013, eight NH90s were on firm order. On 1 August 2013, Belgium received its first NH90 NFH at Full Operational Capability (FOC). On 23 October 2013, Belgium&#x27;s first NH90 TTH entered service, the last was delivered on 13 November 2014. From first delivery until the last, three NH90s flew 34 hours a month for a total of 450 flight hours with a 67 percent availability rate, making Belgium one of the type&#x27;s most intensive users. Two NH90 NFHs for the navy were delivered, the final two were delivered by early 2015 to replace their Westland Sea King helicopters for Search and Rescue operations.

On 21 August 2015, the Belgian Navy declared its NH90s had attained initial operational readiness; on 28 August 2015, the first rescue mission performed by a Belgian Navy NH90 took place.

In June 2020, the Strategic Defence Review (STAR) of Belgium planned to phase out the 4 TTH helicopters by 2024 due to their high operating costs and low availability. They are planned to be replaced, along with the Agusta A109, by 15 Airbus H145M helicopters. The 4 NFH variants are to remain operational and be provided with currently-lacking sensors and weapons for ASW. There was discussion in 2023 to sell the 4 TTH and buy one more NFH; together with the acquisition of new helicopters the NFH will no longer be tasked with SAR missions. Belgium is expanding its defense budget and naval capabilities in the 2030s, and naval NH90s are planned to be upgraded and to operate from in-service frigates. In addition, Belgium is buying a NH90 mission flight trainer in partnership with the Netherlands.

===Finland===
In October 2001, Finland signed a contract for 20 NH90 TTHs for the Finnish Army to replace its ageing fleet of Mil Mi-8 helicopters. This decision was done a group as part of the Nordic Standard Helicopter program along with Sweden and Norway. In March 2008, NHIndustries began NH90 deliveries to Finland; deliveries had been delayed from an initial 2004 date, to minimize further delay, aircraft were first delivered to an Initial Operational Configuration (IOC-) and Nearly Operational Configuration (IOC+), to be later modified by Patria into a Final Operational Configuration (FOC). In September 2011, the Finnish Defence Forces and Patria signed an agreement to provide ballistic protection for onboard personnel across the NH90 fleet.

In June 2011, nine Finnish NH90s participated in the Finnish Defense Forces&#x27; main field exercise, transporting 157 soldiers across 320 kilometers in two rotations; their performance was described as having exceeded expectations. In January 2015, it was reported that Finnish NH90s had been experiencing considerable reliability issues, at one time in 2014 fleet availability dipped to 19%, and some spare parts had up to seven months waiting time. By early 2015, the combined NH90s fleet had accumulated a total of 7,000 flight hours, and had an availability rate of 40%. On 18 June 2015, delivery of the final Finnish NH90 took place. In November 2015, the availability rate was reported as having surpassed 50 percent. All were in Final Operational Configuration (FOC) in 2018.

===France===
The French government had initially ordered a total of 34 NH90 TTHs for the French Army Light Aviation and 27 NFH for the Navy. Both versions will be named &quot;Caïman&quot; and final assembly will be carried out by Airbus Helicopters. Early on, the French Army stated its intention to buy 68 NH90 in two separate contracts. Under the &quot;Bonn rebate&quot; deal, France received a 12% discount on its 68 Army NH90s; a November 2012 Senate report put the French TTH unit price at €28.6M after discount, set on the assumption of total orders of 605 aircraft by 2020. Cuts to France&#x27;s order would have led to workshare reallocation; possibly including French Navy NFH90s being assembled in Italy and Fokker performing maintenance of French TTHs. On 29 May 2013, France formally ordered the second batch of 34 NH90 TTHs for just under €1 billion. In January 2016, France placed an order for six additional NH90 TTHs.
The French Army took delivery of its first NH90 TTH in December 2011. Just one week after entering service, a French NH90 rescued 19 people from supply ship TK &quot;Bremen&quot; at night. On 21 December 2012, the French Navy received its first NH90 NFH in final operating capability. In December 2010, the NH90 formally achieved in-service status with the French Navy, being initially used to perform search and rescue and maritime counter-terrorism operations. The first seven NH90s were delivered to an interim &quot;Step A&quot; configuration; later deliveries were to the &quot;Step B&quot; standard and produced at a rate of two per year until 2020. For the ASW role in French service, it is equipped with dipping sonar, acoustic buoys and MU90 torpedoes. The French Navy formally cleared the type to perform ASW duties in 2012, clearance to perform ASW missions followed in 2013, allowing the NH90 to take over missions previously performed by the Westland Lynx and Aérospatiale Super Frelon rotorcraft fleets. On 3 November 2014, the French Army Light Aviation deployed two of its NH90s to Mali; both helicopters had been fitted with three additional fuel tanks to fly the four-day ferry flight to the region.

In October 2020, France signed a contract to develop the TFRA Standard 2 configuration for the French Army&#x27;s special forces using the final batch of 10 NH90 TTH already ordered. A design study for the new configuration began 18 months earlier in cooperation with Belgium and Australia. The first phase featured a Safran EuroFLIR 410 electro-optical system (EOS), external fuel tanks and a digital 3D map. The cabin was outfitted with a central rappelling and extraction device, gun mounts for M3M .50 caliber machine guns and foldable step. The rear ramp has a quick removable leaf doors system, fast-rope beam, fold-able step and various improvements made to enable the door&#x27;s use mid-flight. Future gear, such as the Safran Eurofl&#x27;Eye distributed aperture system (DAS) and Thales TopOwl helmet-mounted display, may be integrated in a second phase with electrical and mechanical provisions made for their installation. The first five are to be delivered in 2025 and the last five in 2026 to the 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment.

In 2021, French NH90s rescued six people (and one stranded rescuer) from a capsized yacht in an offshore civilian sea rescue, in extreme sea and wind conditions at the edge of its flight envelope. The weather was so extreme the first rescuer was stranded when the winch line snapped, but the rescuer along with the boaters, who were in a life raft were able to be retrieved by an additional NH90. At the end of 2022, the French Navy finally retired its last Alouette III helicopters which had been in service for 60 years, and was on the training helicopters before pilots moved onto the NH90, along with Dauphin.

===Germany===

The German Army procured the troop transport variant; the first three serial production NH90s were delivered to the army in December 2006. By January 2013, a total of 80 aircraft were on order for the army. In 2009, the German Navy was also considering the procurement of up to 30 NFH for its new Maritime Helicopter. In March 2013, the German government chose to reorganise the NH90 procurement; the Army&#x27;s fleet of 122 NH90s was reduced to 82; 18 NH90s previously ordered for the army were converted to the NFH maritime variant for the navy instead. On 26 June 2013, the German defense committee declared that the order for a combined 202 NH90 and Tiger helicopters was to be reduced to 157. In December 2014, Germany announced that, in addition to the 80 troop transports firmly on order, it was considering an option for an additional 22 NH90s; it was investigating the possibility of setting up a multinational helicopter unit to operate these 22 NH90s as a shared NATO resource with other countries using and contributing to the force.

In July 2012, Germany&#x27;s NH90 fleet reached a combined total of 5,000 flight hours. In April 2013, up to 4 German Army NH90 TTHs were deployed in Afghanistan in a Forward Air Medical Evacuation role in support of coalition forces operating in the country. On 23 June 2013, German Army NH90s were declared operationally capable of medical evacuation operations. Following an engine failure and controlled crash in Uzbekistan in July 2014, the army temporarily grounded the type for investigation. In December 2015, it was announced that production of the German Navy&#x27;s variant of the NH90 NFH, named &quot;Sea Lion&quot;, had commenced; a refit of the German Army&#x27;s TTH variant was also underway at the same time. Since late 2014, Germany has promoted the creation of a multinational NH90 force for combat MEDEVAC missions; the taskforce would comprise up to 20 NH90s.

The Navy&#x27;s version, known as the NH90 Sea Lion, is based on the NH90 NFH. It first flew on 8 December 2016. The 18 NH90 Sea Lions are equipped with improved navigation and communications equipment, permitting operation within civil airspace, along with additional sensors for military missions. The IFF system was also updated. Designed to replace Germany&#x27;s Westland Sea Kings in the SAR and Vertrep roles, the Sea Lion was to enter service with the German Navy by the second quarter of 2019. The first NFH Sea Lion was accepted in October 2019. On 26 November 2019, the German Navy stated that the NH90 was not operational yet due to deficiencies in technical documentation not allowing safe operations. The NFH Sea Lion entered service in June 2020. By February 2023, 18 Sea Lion had been delivered.

On 20 November 2020, the Bundestag approved the purchase of 31 more helicopters for the navy to replace their 22 Sea Lynx Mk88A helicopters via a deal valued at €2.7 billion, including spares, accessories, and training material. This version, called the Sea Tiger, is designed for ASW and ship warfare (and can also do SAR), and operates in conjunction with German Navy Frigates. The Sea Tiger variant is similar to the French NFH Caiman version, it is planned to enter service starting in 2025. The first flight of the Sea Tiger was in late November 2023.

===Greece===
In August 2003, Greece ordered 20 NH90s with an option for 14 more. In early 2013, the German newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; alleged that Airbus officials paid €41 million in bribes to Greek officials to secure the order; Airbus stated that the claim was &quot;groundless&quot;. On 12 December it was stated that deliveries would start again after an embargo by the Hellenic Government, with four helicopters being of the SPECOPS specification.

By early 2017, 12 NH90s had been delivered and were in service, with eight aircraft yet to be delivered. By December 2023, there were 16 NH90 in service, which operated alongside around twelve AS332 Super Puma and 60 older UH-1H (AB-205) as multirole helicopters; at this time it was announced the UH-60 was selected to replace both these older types.

===Italy===

In June 2000, Italy signed an initial contract for a batch of 60 TTH (Tactical Transport Helicopter) for the Italian Army, along with a further 46 NFH (NATO Frigate Helicopter) and 10 TTH for the Italian Navy. On 30 December 2007, the first NH90 TTH was formally handed over to the Italian Army. On 23 June 2011, the navy received its first NH90, which was delivered to an interim MOC (Meaningful Operational Capability) standard, capable of performing training, search and rescue, and utility operations; anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities were not initially available until aircraft are retrofitted to a FOC (Final Operational Capability) standard. In May 2013, the Italian Army took delivery of the first NH90 TTH of a FOC standard; in November 2013, the Italian Navy took delivery of its first FOC-standard NH90 NFH. The Italian NH90 fleet uses the GE T700-T6E1 turbine engine. Italian NH90s are used for the following tasks tactical troop transport according NHI as reported by HeliHub news: logistics support, special operations, cargo resupply and hoisting, medical evacuations, light vehicle transport, disaster relief, and emergency response operations.

In 2012, Italy deployed a total of 5 Army NH90 TTHs to support troops participating in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. The NH90s, which were air-transported individually by allied Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft, replaced six Agusta/Bell 205s in performing tactical transport and medevac operations; Army Aviation Commander Gen. Enzo Stefanini stated that &quot;…in Afghan conditions, the NH90 is delivering performance 15 percent above what was envisaged&quot;. In December 2022, Italy received its 60th and final TTH (Transport version) from the Venice Tessera facility which opened in 2010 and delivered its first aircraft in 2011.

In October 2023, the Italian Navy received its 56th and final NH90; that same month, the service also reportedly attained a cumulative 35,000 flights hours across its fleet.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands, one of the original supporters of the programme, ordered a total of 20 units, comprising 12 NFH and 8 TNFH for the Royal Netherlands Navy, In 2010, the Royal Netherlands Navy became the first customer to receive the NFH variant.

In 2009, concerns surfaced that design changes had made the NH90 too heavy to operate from Dutch frigates for which they were ordered. In June 2014, the Dutch government decided not to accept the last batch of 7 NH90s due to some 100 shortcomings found in relation to the design, manufacture, and material choice of the rotorcraft, in particular corrosion in the presence of salt water. In December 2014, deliveries restarted after the Dutch government came to an agreement with NHI, under which modifications and necessary repairs against corrosion would be made at the manufacturer&#x27;s cost; 75 of the 100 shortcomings were also reported as having been solved.

In April 2013, the navy deployed the type onboard to fight piracy in the Gulf of Aden. In November 2014, the navy deployed a single NH90 NFH to Somalia to support Operation Atalanta. In 2020 one NH90 was lost in an accident in the Caribbean, which reduced the fleet size to 19. In 2024, the Netherlands announced it would upgrade its remaining fleet with a mid-life upgrade including communications and weapon systems. On 5 September 2024, the Dutch MoD released the 2024 Defense Memorandum where 6 more NH90 NFH helicopters are to be ordered increasing the fleet to a total of 25.

===New Zealand===
In July 2006, the New Zealand government signed a NZ$771 million (~€500M) contract to purchase eight NH90s (plus one extra for spares) to replace the Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s (RNZAF) fleet of 13 UH-1 Iroquois helicopters. For ease of manufacture and logistics, New Zealand deliberately chose its NH90 configuration to be nearly identical to the larger Australian fleet. On 7 December 2011, deliveries to New Zealand formally began with the first two NH90s being airlifted by a leased Antonov An-124 cargo aircraft to RNZAF Base Ohakea. In February 2013, the first phase of the RNZAF&#x27;s operational evaluation of the NH90 was completed, clearing the type to begin operational duties.

Between September 2013 and July 2014, the first four delivered NH90s were retrofitted to a final operational configuration; later aircraft were already delivered to this standard. On 31 October 2014, the RNZAF announced that they had received into service the last of the eight NH90 TTHs. Following command structure changes in December 2014, the NH90 fleet was tasked with additional responsibilities, including casualty evacuation during search and rescue operations and providing transport services to the New Zealand Police and other government personnel. In April 2015, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee questioned the inability of the NH90 fleet to contribute to relief efforts in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam, revealing that the fleet may be refitted with an automated blade and tail folding system to better enable ship borne deployments in the future.

In April 2016, NH90s flew 160 hours during relief missions in Fiji following the devastation of Cyclone Winston, and in transported variety of staff to different locations. The NH90 served alongside the NZ Seaprites, and with additional logistical support from fixed wing aircraft. After the Kaikōura earthquakes in November 2016, the NH90s were critical in delivering aid and supplies to the area. They also assisted with civilian evacuations of foreign nationals.

In April 2017, the RNZAF&#x27;s NH90 fleet was grounded following an in-flight single engine failure which forced an emergency landing.

In November 2021, New Zealand NH90, NZ3302, became the first of its type to reach 2,000 flying hours. According to the RNZAF, despite being delivered years after other customers, high serviceability rates allow New Zealand NH90s to fly more hours per aircraft than other operators. New Zealand states it was getting acceptable flight hours from its fleet and was not going to change its maintenance regime. As of 2024, there are eight NH90s in operation with the New Zealand Defense Forces.

===Norway===
In 2001, Norway ordered 14 NH90s for the Royal Norwegian Navy and Norwegian Coast Guard, originally set to be delivered in 2005–2008. This move came as part of the Nordic Standard Helicopter Program along with Sweden and Finland. In December 2011, the first NH90 was delivered. In July 2012, the Norwegian Deputy Defence Minister Roger Ingebrigtsen announced that &quot;once our current Westland Lynx helicopters reach their end of life in 2014, we are going to have replacement helicopters on our naval vessels. If the NH90 hasn&#x27;t been delivered, we will purchase another helicopter... considering that the aircraft were to be delivered by 2005, and that delivery is yet to start by 2012, our confidence in the producer isn&#x27;t exactly on the rise&quot; In August 2012, it was reported that the Royal Norwegian Air Force would recommend that the Ministry of Defence contact Sikorsky to check if H-60 Seahawk variants, such as the MH-60R, could be a viable NH90 alternative for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties. Defence Minister Espen Barth Eide stated &quot;We still believe the marine version of the NH90 to be the optimal platform, and we hope to purchase it, but there are limits to our patience.&quot; By January 2016, six NH90s had been delivered.

A February 2018 report by the Norwegian Armed Forces found that its NH90 fleet offered insufficient flight hours for the intended roles; this report advised that all helicopters be converted to the ASW role as required by the Royal Norwegian Navy, as opposed to current plans which see 6 of the 14 NH90s in that role, and the rest configured for Norwegian Coast Guard duties. The Norwegian Ministry of Defence stated that it would consider the report&#x27;s recommendations. In September 2018, the Norwegian Armed Forces reversed course via an updated study which affirmed that, under certain conditions, the requirements for both the navy and coast guard can be met with 14 NH90s; these conditions specifically state good spare parts availability, sufficient aircraft for maintenance scheduling, and a sufficient overhaul capacity. Norwegian Minister of Defence Frank Bakke-Jensen added that, although the inauguration is challenging, the ministry holds on to the timeline in which phasing in will be completed by 2022.

In February 2022, the Norwegian Minister of Defense again threatened to terminate the NH90 contract due to concerns over new delays and NHI not meeting contractual obligations, considering sourcing alternative helicopters. In June 2022, the Norwegian Minister of Defense Bjørn Arild Gram announced the Norwegian Defence Material Agency was given the task to terminate the NH90 contract due to NHI not meeting contractual obligations, and announced that the NH90 is taken out of operation with immediate effect. Ten months later, Gram stated that the Lockheed Martin MH-60R Seahawk would replace the NH90. Norway also operates Westland Sea Kings and AW101 Merlins.

===Oman===
In July 2004, the Sultanate of Oman issued an order for a total of 20 NH90 TTHs for the Royal Air Force of Oman (RAFO). To cope with the extreme flight conditions of the Middle East, RAFO NH90s are equipped with enhanced power plants; the type is to replace the Agusta/Bell 205A and Agusta/Bell 212 used for tactical transport and search and rescue operations. On 23 June 2010, the first two NH90 TTHs were delivered to the RAFO at Musana Air Base. By July 2012, ten NH90s had been delivered to the RAFO; in Omani service, the NH90 has established an endurance record, flying without refueling during a 5-hour 21 minute-long mission. The Oman NH90 are known to use 20 mm gun pods, as opposed to smaller caliber door guns.

===Qatar===
In 2014, Qatar announced that it was set to spend $2.76 billion on procuring NH90s to modernizing its military helicopter fleet. A contract valued at 3 billion euros was signed at the Dimdex defence exhibition on 14 March 2018, which finalised the purchase of 28 NH90s, comprising 16 NH90s for tactical transport and 12 NH90s for naval purposes. On 20 August 2018, Leonardo announced the contract with Qatar was made effective for a total sum of US$3.7 billion, covering the agreed upon number of NH90s, with an option with six more of each type.

On 23 December 2020, the first flights for Qatari-bound NH90s were being conducted for general evaluation. The first two NH90 for Qatar were handed over in March 2022.

===Spain===

On 20 May 2005 the Council of Ministers authorised the acquisition of 45 NH90 TTHs; in December 2006, it was announced that a procurement contract for the Spanish Armed Forces had been signed. The Spanish NH90 variant features domestically assembled General Electric CT7-8F5 engines, customised communications suite, and Indra-developed electronic warning systems. The original budget for the procurement was for €1,260 million; by 2010, this had grown to €2,463M. In June 2012, it was announced that Spain was negotiating to cut its purchase to 37 aircraft. On 18 December 2014, Spain took delivery of the first NH90 TTH, which had been assembled at Airbus Helicopters Albacete facility; by this point, the order had been reduced to a total of 22 NH90s of the TTH variant. Spain chose the GE CT7-8F5 turbine engine for its fleet.

In January 2018, NHIndustries president Vincent Dubrule stated he was confident Spain would place a follow-on order by the end of 2018 for an additional 23 TTH NH90s, bringing the total back up to 45. In September 2018, the Spanish government agreed to the purchase of the additional 23 TTH NH90s, including seven for naval purposes. Spain stated in early 2023 the NH90 was &quot;working perfectly&quot;.

The Spanish defence is evaluating the possibility to integrate weapons and systems to the potential NH90 HSPN for the Spanish Navy. In December 2024, Spain took deliver of its first Standard 3 NH90, which featured a gross take off weight of 11 tonnes, enhanced communication and safety features among other enhancements.

===Sweden===
In 2001, Sweden signed a contract for 18 NH90 TTH, made up of 13 TTT/SAR and 5 SAR/ASW to be operated by the Swedish Air Force. The decision to order the NH90 was made as part of the Nordic Standard Helicopter program along with Norway and Finland; the Swedish version is the High Cabin Variant (HCV). Because of renewed foreign submarine activity at the Swedish coast in 2014, it was decided in 2015 that four TTT/SAR would be modified to SAR/ASW in order to increase the anti-submarine warfare capability, so there will be 9 TTT/SAR and 9 SAR/ASW. The NH90 is known as the &quot;Helikopter 14&quot; (HKP14) in Swedish service, the FOC version of TTT/SAR are designated Hkp14E and the FOC version of SAR/ASW are designated Hkp14F.

Swedish Hkp14 are used for antisubmarine operations, troop transport, search and rescue, and medical evacuations.

Sweden did not expect its NH90s to be operational until 2020 and ordered 15 UH-60M Black Hawks in 2011, deploying four of its new Black Hawks to Afghanistan in March 2013. In December 2015, the first Swedish NH90 in a full ASW configuration was delivered. On 1 November 2022, the Swedish Supreme Commander, General Michael Byden, announced that Sweden&#x27;s NH90s will be replaced with S-70 (H-60) variants and a yet to be determined type. In December 2023, Sweden finished upgrades on the SAR version of its NH90 fleet.

==Order campaigns==
The NH90 has been considered by a number of helicopter procurements, however some did not lead to helicopter delivery. 
;Portugal
Portugal was the fifth nation to join the programme with an order for ten transport NH90 in June 2001; it was intended for these to equip the Portuguese Army Light Aviation Unit. However, in July 2012, fiscal consequences of the Great Recession led Portugal to cancel the order, despite having already spent €87m on the project, in order to save another €420m in acquisition and running costs to 2020.

;Saudi Arabia
In July 2006, the Saudi Government agreed to purchase 64 NH90s. Then in October 2007 the government changed its plans, and agreed to buy 150 Russian-made Mi-35 and Mi-17 helicopters instead.

;Egypt
In July 2015, the Egyptian Navy entered negotiations for the purchase of 5 NH90 NFHs; these were intended to serve on board its newly acquired FREMM frigate &quot;Tahya Misr&quot; and 4 Gowind corvettes that were also on order. These NH90s would all be of French standard. In October 2015, it was reported that negotiations for a &quot;large quantity&quot; of NH90s had reached an advanced stage. In April 2019, it was announced that Egypt was ordering the AW149 and not the NH90.
;South Korea
South Korea approved a nearly 2.87 trillion won (US$2.23 billion) to procure naval helicopters to replace its aging Lynx helicopters, and the NH90 is planned to be one of the candidates.

==Variants==
There are two main variants, the TTH and the NFH. The NFH is oriented towards naval use and the TTH, land-based operations. A number of customizations such as for medical evacuation, search and rescue, special operations, and also a version with a higher cabin height were made.

Overall, the aircraft is multirole, but only certain aircraft take on certain missions. For example, Sweden has a TTH version called the TTT, but has two versions: one for SAR and one for ASW.

===NFH: NATO Frigate Helicopter===
The primary role of the NFH version is autonomous ASW and anti-surface unit warfare (ASuW), mainly from naval ships. These aircraft are equipped for day and night, adverse weather and severe ship motion operations. Additional roles include anti-air warfare support, vertical replenishment (VERTREP), SAR and troop transport. France are splitting their purchase between the &quot;NFH version combat&quot; costing €43.3m in FY2013 and the &quot;NFH version soutien&quot; (support) at €36.4m in FY2013.

One of the major differences of the NFH is that it has a folding tail and rotors, and a stronger undercarriage suitable for marine landings.

;SH-90A
:Italian Navy designation from 2012 for NH90 NFH.
;NH90 NFH Caïman
:French Navy designation for NH90 NFH.
;NH90 Sea Lion
:German Navy development of the French NH90 NFH. The Sea Lion features a reduced set of sensors as the main task is SAR and ship based Transport (VERTREP and Special Forces) and is usually unarmed (doorguns can be installed). First flight was on 8 December 2016 and service deliveries started in October 2019.
;NH90 Sea Tiger
:Another German Navy development of the NFH90 for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface unit warfare. The first helicopters were ordered in 2019 with a potential total of up to 31.
;NH90 HSPN
:Potential Spanish variant of the NH90 to be used by the Navy, with Spanish integrated equipment, new weapons such as the NSM-AL, and also communication equipment.

===TTH: Tactical Transport Helicopter===
The primary role of the TTH version is the transport of 20 troops or more than 2,500 kg of cargo, heliborne operations and search &amp; rescue. It can quickly be adapted to MEDEVAC/CASEVAC missions by fitting up to 12 stretchers or cargo delivery capability.

===MTT: Maritime Tactical Transport===
The MTT is a blend between the TTH and NFH, combining the land-based configuration of the TTH with specialized maritime features of the NFH, including folding rotorblades and tail-boom, and a strengthened undercarriage. The variant was first announced in February 2019 and has reportedly piqued interest from the Spanish and Italian armed forces who may order this variant as part of existing orders.

This version was adopted by Italy, but was called the MITT TTH. MITT stands for Maritime Italian Navy Tactical Transport (MITT), and ten were delivered to the Italian Navy with designation MH-90.

== Accidents ==

From 2008 there have been reports at least 11 accidents involving NH90 of various types.

;Examples
* In April 2010, an Australian MRH-90 suffered a single engine failure near Adelaide, landing safely at RAAF Base Edinburgh Australia grounded their MRH-90 fleet due to engine issues. The cause of the failure was determined to be contact between the compressor blade and the engine casing; new preventative inspections were enacted and flights resumed in July 2010. One factor stated for the engine failure was complications relating to an inflight engine restart.
* In March 2023, an Australian MRH-90 with ten aboard experienced an engine failure and ditched in Jervis Bay with everyone surviving. The helicopter&#x27;s flotation system was deployed, allowing it to float, and it was towed onto a nearby beach.
* In July 2023, an Australian MRH-90 crashed at night during Exercise Talisman Sabre off the coast of Hamilton Island, Queensland, with the loss of its four crew. Parts of the airframe and human remains were found in a debris field in 40 meters of water, consistent with a catastrophic impact. The cause was under investigation as of late 2023.

<doc id="513919" wikidata="Q2271334" url="?curid=513919" title="Ken Venturi">
<text>Kenneth Paul Venturi (May 15, 1931May 17, 2013) was an American professional golfer and golf broadcaster. In a career shortened by injuries, he won 14 events on the PGA Tour including a major, the U.S. Open in 1964. Shortly before his death in 2013, Venturi was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Early years and amateur career==
Born in San Francisco, California, Venturi learned to play golf at an early age, and developed his game at Harding Park Golf Course and other public courses in the Bay Area. He attended Lincoln High School and was the San Francisco high school golf champion in 1948 and 1949. Venturi also attended San José State University, where he was a member of the Spartan men&#x27;s golf team from 1951 through 1953.

In the early 1950s, he was a pupil of Byron Nelson, and was also influenced by playing partner Ben Hogan. Venturi won the California State Amateur Championship in 1951 and 1956, serving in the U.S. Army in Korea and Europe in the interim.

Venturi first gained national attention at age 24; while still an amateur, he finished second in the Masters in 1956, one shot behind Jack Burke Jr., Venturi led after each of the first three rounds in an attempt to become the first-ever amateur to win the Masters, but shot a final round 80 and relinquished a four-shot lead. Through 2024, no amateur has won the Masters.

==Professional career==
Venturi turned pro at the end of 1956 and was a regular winner during his early years on the PGA Tour. He again came close to winning the Masters in 1958 and 1960, but was edged out both times by Arnold Palmer. On January 24, 1960, Venturi won the Bing Crosby National Pro-Am on the 1960 PGA Tour.

After suffering minor injuries in an automobile accident in 1961, Venturi&#x27;s swing, and thus his career, began to slide. This slump lasted until 1964 when, for no reason even Venturi could fathom, he began playing well again. After a couple of high finishes, Venturi reached the pinnacle of his comeback by winning the U.S. Open in 1964 at Congressional Country Club, after nearly collapsing in the near- heat and humidity of the 36-hole final day. (The format was changed the next year in 1965.) Venturi was the first player to win the U.S. Open after conquering a sectional qualifier.

Venturi won again in July and August, tied for fifth in the PGA Championship, and received that year&#x27;s &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award and PGA Player of the Year award. He played on the Ryder Cup team in 1965, and received the 1998 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA&#x27;s highest honor.

After 1964, Venturi&#x27;s career again took a blow when he was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists. After missing the cut at the Masters by nine strokes, he received treatment at the Mayo Clinic in May. Defending his title at the U.S. Open in June, Venturi continued to have difficulty with his hands and entered the championship with plans to have surgery the following week. He missed the cut by ten strokes, had the surgery on both wrists, and was sidelined until the Ryder Cup in October in England. Venturi&#x27;s condition improved and he won a tour event in January 1966 at the very familiar Harding Park in his hometown, but he soon relapsed; after additional surgeries, he could not regain his form.

==Broadcasting career==
After retiring from the Tour in 1967 with a total of 14 career wins, Venturi spent the next 35 years working as a color commentator and lead analyst for CBS Sports – the longest lead analyst stint in sports broadcasting history, made remarkable by the fact that he had a stutter, which was less manageable early in life. He retired from broadcasting at age 71 in June 2002, succeeded as CBS&#x27; lead analyst by Lanny Wadkins, then Nick Faldo in 2007.

==Other ventures==
===Acting===
Venturi appeared in the 1996 film &quot;Tin Cup&quot;, portraying himself as a commentator at the U.S. Open, held at a fictional course in North Carolina. In one scene, Venturi is shown voicing his opinion that the film&#x27;s protagonist, Roy McAvoy (Kevin Costner), should lay up on a long par-5 rather than try to reach the green in two shots. McAvoy, who decided to go for it, is then shown saying, &quot;This is for Venturi up in the booth thinking I should lay up.&quot; His caddy, played by Cheech Marin, sarcastically responds, &quot;Yeah, what does he know? He only won this tournament before you were born.&quot;

Venturi described the actor and singer Frank Sinatra as his best friend and former roommate.

===Course design and instruction===
In 1990, Venturi redesigned and renovated the Eagle Creek Golf &amp; Country Club course near Naples, Florida. He also lent his name to a series of instructional schools.

==Honors==
In 2004, after some controversy, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Venturi. In 2013, he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the lifetime achievement category.

==Death==
Venturi died two days after his 82nd birthday, in Rancho Mirage, California, on May 17, 2013. He had been hospitalized for two months for a spinal infection, pneumonia, and an intestinal infection. Venturi is survived by his third wife Kathleen, two sons, Matthew and Tim and four adult grandchildren Peter, Andrew, Sara and Gianna. He was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City, California.

<doc id="513933" wikidata="Q7974767" url="?curid=513933" title="Watseka">
<text>Watseka or Watchekee (c. 1810–1878) was a Potawatomi Native American woman, born in Illinois, and named for the heroine of a Potawatomi legend. Her uncle was Tamin, the chief of the Kankakee Potawatomi Indians.

She was also known by the name of Josette (or Zozette) Bergeron.

==Early life==
Watseka was born around 1810 at Buncombe, an &quot;Indian village site&quot; in Illinois. The village was presided over by Tamin, her uncle; by 1880, the site was called Concord. Her father was Shabbona who was an ally of Tecumseh during the war of 1812; her mother was Monashki.

==Biography==

At age 10 or 11, she became engaged to Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard, whom she married in 1826 at age fourteen or fifteen. Hubbard and Watseka had a daughter who died in infancy. They mutually dissolved the union in 1826. Watseka married Noel Le Vasseur at age eighteen, and was described as &quot;beautiful, intelligent and petite.&quot; She had three children with Le Vasseur, who learned to speak the Potawatomi language. In 1836, she left for Council Bluffs, Iowa, where her tribe had been removed in 1832 following the Treaty of Camp Tippecanoe. In 1840 Watseka married the French-Canadian Francis Xavier Bergeron. 

Her biography per the Citizen Potawatomi Nation Cultural Heritage Center states: &quot;French-Canadian Francis Xavier Bergeron arrived in the Great Lakes region as a young man where he met Watseka on one of her trips back to the region. In 1840, she received the Christian name Josette or Zozetta upon her baptism. She and Francis wed around that same time, but it was not her first marriage. Before marrying Bergeron, she had two other husbands named Noel LeVasseur and Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard. She had four children: Jean Batiste, Catherine (Kate), Matilda and Charlie.&quot;

She is known for playing an &quot;instrumental role&quot; in Kankakee and Iroquois counties; and in particular, Bourbonnaise Grove, Illinois. 

She died in Council Bluffs in 1878.

==Legacy==

A city in East Central Illinois was named in her honor.

The Daughters of the American Revolution, Iroquois County Chapter was named in her honor.

Watseka and Bergeron&#x27;s daughter Catherine (Kate) married Joseph L. Melott, a frenchman; they were the principal founders of the community, Mission Hill, now known as Wanette, Oklahoma.

<text>Baron Roborough, of Maristow in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 24 January 1938 for Sir Henry Lopes, 4th Baronet. He had earlier represented Grantham, Lincolnshire, in Parliament as a Conservative. The Baronetcy, of Maristow House in the County of Devon, had been created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 1 November 1805 for Manasseh Masseh Lopes, a member of a wealthy family of Portuguese Jewish origin, with special remainder to his nephew Ralph Franco, son of his sister Maria. Manasseh Masseh Lopes converted to Christianity in 1802, and later represented Evesham, in Worcestershire, Barnstaple in Devon, and Westbury in Somerset, in Parliament. However, in 1819 he was twice convicted of bribing the voters in both Barnstaple and Grampound in order to be elected to Parliament, and was sentenced to imprisonment and heavy fines. He was also unseated by the House of Commons, but after his release from prison he nonetheless got elected for Westbury, a pocket borough which he controlled to a great extent.

Lopes was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew Ralph Franco, the second Baronet, who assumed the surname of Lopes in lieu of Franco. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Westbury and South Devonshire. His son, the third Baronet, also sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Westbury and South Devonshire and served under Benjamin Disraeli as a Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1874 to 1880. In 1885 he was admitted to the Privy Council. He was the father of the fourth Baronet, who was raised to the peerage in 1938. The first Baron&#x27;s son, the second Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of Devon from 1958 to 1978. As of 2015 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded in 2015.

Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow, was a younger son of the second Baronet.

The family seat was Maristow House, in the parish of Tamerton Foliot, near Plymouth, Devon, (which they occupied 1798–1938) with the dower house being at nearby Roborough House, in Roborough, near Plymouth, Devon. Their seat today is Bickham House, adjoining the Maristow House estate to the north-east. The Lopes family, descendants of Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes, 1st Baronet, lived in Roborough in the twentieth century, after moving from nearby Maristow House and before relocating to Gnaton, a smaller mansion on the coast near Noss Mayo. The very old village pub, which stands on the main street of Roborough is called the Lopes Arms.

<text>A chromophil is a cell which is easily stainable by absorbing chromium salts used in histology to increase the visual contrast of samples for microscopy.

==Function==
Chromophil cells are mostly hormone-producing cells containing so-called chromaffin granules. In these subcellular structures, amino acid precursors to certain hormones are accumulated and subsequently decarboxylated to the corresponding amines, for example epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin. Chromophil cells therefore belong to the group of APUD (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) cells.

==Location==
These cells are scattered throughout the whole body, but particularly in glands such as the hypothalamus, hypophysis, thyroid, parathyroid and pancreas. In adult animals, chromophil cells make up the largest portion of the stria in the cochlear duct.

<doc id="513944" wikidata="Q3067870" url="?curid=513944" title="Federal Emergency Relief Administration">
<text>The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was a program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, building on the Hoover administration&#x27;s Emergency Relief and Construction Act. It was replaced in 1935 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA).

During the Hoover Administration, the federal government gave loans to the states to operate relief programs. One of these, the New York state program TERA (Temporary Emergency Relief Administration), was set up in 1931 and headed by Harry Hopkins, a close adviser to then-Governor Roosevelt. A few years later, as president, Roosevelt asked Congress to set up FERA—which gave grants to the states for the same purpose—in May 1933, and appointed Hopkins to head it. Along with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), it was the first relief operation under the New Deal.

FERA&#x27;s main goal was to alleviate household unemployment by creating new unskilled jobs in local and state government. Jobs were more expensive than direct cash payments (called &quot;the dole&quot;), but were psychologically more beneficial to the unemployed, who wanted any sort of job for self-esteem. From May 1933 until it closed in December 1935, FERA gave people and localities $3.1 billion (the equivalent of $70.8 billion in 2023). FERA provided work for over 20 million people and developed facilities on public lands across the country.

Faced with continued high unemployment and concerns for public welfare during the coming winter of 1933–34, FERA instituted the Civil Works Administration (CWA) as a $400 million short-term measure to get people to work. FERA was shut down in 1935 and its work taken over by two completely new federal agencies, the WPA and the Social Security Administration.

==Projects==

FERA operated a wide variety of work-relief projects, including construction, projects for professionals (e.g., writers, artists, actors, and musicians), and production of consumer goods.

===Vocational education===
Workers&#x27; education, a form of adult education, emphasized the study of economic and social problems from the workers&#x27; perspective. When the FERA created its adult education program in 1933, workers&#x27; education classes were included. Between 1933 and 1943, 36 experiment programs in workers&#x27; education were launched, 17 of them lasting over ten years. With as many as two thousand teachers employed at one time, officials conservatively estimated that the program reached at least one million workers nationwide until it was ended in World War II. Three distinct phases of a federal workers&#x27; education program existed: FERA (1933–1935), Works Progress Administration (WPA—prior to separation from the other adult education programs, 1935–1939), and WPA Workers&#x27; Service Program (1939–1943). FERA and WPA workers&#x27; education stimulated educational activities within the labor movement. For example, in Indiana this program was particularly popular among the new, more radical CIO unions. Federal workers&#x27; education activities also encouraged union-university cooperation and laid the foundation for labor education at Indiana University. New Dealers designed the WPA Workers&#x27; Service Program as the model for a Federal Labor Extension Service, similar to the existing federal agricultural extension program, but it was never implemented.

===Women===

Ellen Sullivan Woodward was director of women&#x27;s work for FERA and CWA. During the short lifespan of the CWA, Woodward placed women in such civil works projects as sanitation surveys, highway and park beautification, public building renovation, public records surveys, and museum development. Most were unemployed white collar clerical workers. In July 1934, the FERA established a separate division for professional and nonconstruction projects. Project designers in the division for professional projects faced an enormous challenge in creating effective and meaningful work for unskilled women. In 1935 she became assistant administrator of the Works Progress Administration, where she directed the income-earning projects of some 500,000 women.

===Food===
Poor people lacked enough food in the Depression, and farmers had too much. The mismatch was solved by the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC), FERA, and WPA programs which aimed to reduce farm surpluses by government purchase and then redistribution of food to the needy. Three methods of distribution were employed with varying success: direct distribution, Food Stamps, and school lunches.

==State and local studies==

===Oklahoma===
Mullins (1999) examines the hesitant relief efforts of Oklahoma City residents during the early years of the Depression, 1930–35, under Governor William H. Murray, emphasizing the community&#x27;s reluctance to comply with FERA rules. Fearing that aid recipients would become dependent on their assistance, Oklahoma City administrators sparingly doled out federal and local relief funds; city leaders initiated a campaign to discourage migration into the city; local newspapers failed to print the location of soup lines; voters rejected a bond issue to bolster relief funds; and the city council declined to increase taxes to boost its depression relief budget. At issue was the control over FERA distribution imposed by Governor Murray, and lawmakers&#x27; reluctance to meet federal funding match assessments, despite a budget surplus in Oklahoma City and sufficient state funds to reduce property taxes. Although he criticized the welfare bureaucracy, Murray championed the state&#x27;s yeoman farmers and took credit for the food, seed, and books that they received from federal funds. New Deal administrators ultimately removed Murray from his oversight role, charging corruption in aid distribution, failure to meet employment quotas, and the inability to determine local funding needs.

===Nebraska===
In Nebraska, Democratic Governor Charles W. Bryan (brother of William Jennings Bryan and the party&#x27;s vice president nominee in 1924) was at first unwilling to request aid from the Hoover administration. When Roosevelt&#x27;s FERA became law in 1933 Nebraska took part. Rowland Haynes, the state&#x27;s emergency relief director, was the major force in implementing such national programs as the FERA and CWA. Robert L. Cochran, who became governor in 1935, was a &quot;cautious progressive&quot; who sought federal assistance and placed Nebraska among the first American states to adopt a social security law. The enduring impact of FERA and social security in Nebraska was to shift responsibility for social welfare from counties to the state, which henceforth accepted federal funding and guidelines. The change in state and national relations may have been the most important legacy of these New Deal programs in Nebraska.

===Tenant farmers===
FERA made welfare payments to Southern tenant farmers 1933–35, with the distribution of money across states and counties was strongly influenced by state governments and the influential planter class. Their interests rested mainly in not allowing federal welfare to undermine their authority and the economic structure that favored landowners. Tenant farmers, however, exerted significant counterpressure by organizing the Southern Tenant Farmers Union and the Alabama Sharecroppers&#x27; Union under the auspices of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The unions agitated for welfare assistance, and their events and campaigns drew national publicity. While tenant farmers remained terribly disadvantaged politically, their collective efforts improved matters substantially in areas where their organizations were strongest.

===Key West===
Julius Stone Jr., changed the economic direction of Key West, Florida, when he was the director of the southeast region of FERA. In 1934, Key West went bankrupt and state turned the city over to the FERA in a dubious constitutional move. Within two years, Stone had reversed the economic disaster and successfully moved the city into tourism, which is still a massive success today. Inventor and educator Blake R. Van Leer also assisted with these efforts and consulted for the state of Florida.

<doc id="513953" wikidata="Q737743" url="?curid=513953" title="Doxapram">
<text>Doxapram hydrochloride (marketed as Dopram, Stimulex or Respiram) is a respiratory stimulant, or analeptic. Administered intravenously, doxapram stimulates an increase in tidal volume, and respiratory rate.

==Mechanism of action==
Doxapram stimulates chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies of the carotid arteries, which in turn, stimulates the respiratory center in the brainstem.

==Appearance==
Doxapram is a white to off-white, odorless, crystalline powder that is stable in light and air. It is soluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in ether. Injectable products have a pH from 3.5–5. Benzyl alcohol or chlorobutanol is added as a preservative agent in commercially available preparations.

==Uses==
Doxapram is used in intensive care settings to stimulate the respiratory rate in patients with respiratory failure. It may be useful for treating respiratory depression in patients who have taken excessive doses of drugs such as opioids which may fail to respond adequately to treatment with naloxone.

It is equally as effective as pethidine in suppressing shivering after surgery.

Doxapram has been used as a reversal agent after general anesthesia in captive sharks and rays, but it must be used with caution, as the animals can become excitatory as a side effect.

==Side effects==
Side effects include high blood pressure, anxiety, rapid heart rate, tremor, sweating, and vomiting. Convulsions have been reported. Its use is relatively contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease, epilepsy, and high blood pressure. It is also contraindicated in newborns and small children, mainly due to the presence of benzyl alcohol, which is included as a preservative.

<text>Moore&#x27;s lightning streaks are lightning type streaks (photopsia) (seen to the temporal side) due to sudden head or eye movement in the dark. They are generally caused by shock waves in the vitreous humor hitting the retina or traction on the retina from fibers in the vitreous humor. The implication is that the vitreous is softer than normal, generally this is not a cause for alarm provided they are momentary, occur only in the dark, are due to sudden head movements (acceleration) and do not occur along with many new tiny black floating specks in the vision. Professional advice should be sought in cases of doubt, as retinal detachment, a serious condition, also can cause flashes in the eye.

They are named after Robert Foster Moore (1878–1963), a British ophthalmologist.

<text>Baron Ravensdale, of Ravensdale in the County of Derby, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1911 for the Conservative politician George Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon, of Kedleston, who had previously served as Viceroy of India. 

== History ==
The title was created on 2 November 1911 for the Conservative politician George Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon, with remainder, in default of issue male, to his eldest daughter and the heirs male of her body, failing whom to his other daughters in like manner in order of primogeniture. Curzon was created Viscount Scarsdale and Earl Curzon of Kedleston at the same time. The viscounty was created with special remainder to the heirs male of his father while the earldom was created with normal remainder to heirs male. Curzon had already in 1898 been created Baron Curzon of Kedleston in the Peerage of Ireland (the last Irish peerage to be created), with remainder to heirs male. In 1916 he succeeded his father as fifth Baron Scarsdale and in 1921 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Kedleston and Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, with remainder to heirs male.

Lord Curzon died without male issue in 1925 and the barony of Curzon of Kedleston, the two earldoms and the marquessate thus became extinct. He was succeeded in the viscountcy of Scarsdale according to the special remainder by his nephew, Richard Curzon, the second Viscount (who also succeeded as sixth Baron Scarsdale; see Viscount Scarsdale for further history of this branch of the family). The barony of Ravensdale passed according to the special remainder to his eldest daughter Irene. In 1958, following the passage of the Life Peerages Act 1958 which permitted women to sit in the House of Lords, Lady Ravensdale was granted a life peerage with the title of Baroness Ravensdale of Kedleston, of Kedleston in the County of Derby. the title is held by her great-great-nephew the fourth Baron, who succeeded in 2017 and was elected to sit in the House of Lords in 2019. He is the great-grandson of Lady Cynthia (second daughter of Lord Curzon of Kedleston) and her husband Oswald Mosley. He also succeeded his grandfather as eighth Baronet of Ancoats. (See Mosley baronets for earlier history of this title.)
==Barons Ravensdale (1911)==

*George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, 1st Baron Ravensdale (1859–1925)
*Mary Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale (1896–1966)
*Nicholas Mosley, 3rd Baron Ravensdale (1923–2017)
**Hon. Shaun Nicholas Mosley (1949–2009)
*Daniel Nicholas Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale (born 1982)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s eldest son, the Hon. Alexander Lucas Mosley (born 2012).

<doc id="513965" wikidata="Q1363009" url="?curid=513965" title="Rammed earth">
<text>Rammed earth is a technique for constructing foundations, floors, and walls using compacted natural raw materials such as earth, chalk, lime, or gravel. It is an ancient method that has been revived recently as a sustainable building method.

Under its French name of pisé it is also a material for sculptures, usually small and made in molds. It has been especially used in Central Asia and Tibetan art, and sometimes in China.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are found on every continent except Antarctica, in a range of environments including temperate, wet, semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a building design appropriate for local climatic conditions are two factors that make its use favourable.

The French term &quot;pisé de terre&quot; or &quot;terre pisé&quot; was sometimes used in English for architectural uses, especially in the 19th century.

==Building process==

Making rammed earth involves compacting a damp mixture of subsoil that has suitable proportions of sand, gravel, clay, silt, and stabilizer if any, into a formwork (an externally supported frame or mold).

Historically, additives such as lime or animal blood were used to stabilize it.

Soil mix is poured into the formwork to a depth of and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original volume. The soil is compacted in batches or courses so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the formwork. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole by hand, but modern construction systems can employ pneumatically-powered tampers.

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork. This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour. The compressive strength of rammed earth increases as it cures. Cement-stabilized rammed earth is cured for a minimum period of 28 days.

In modern rammed earth buildings, the walls are constructed on top of conventional footings or a reinforced concrete slab base.
The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, the &quot;formwork&quot;, which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for each wall section&#x27;s desired shape and dimensions. The form must be durable and well-braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Formwork plays an important role in building rammed earth walls. Historically, wooden planks tied using rope were used to build walls. Modern builders use plywood and/or steel to build formwork.

==Characteristics==

The compressive strength of rammed earth is dictated by factors such as soil type, particle size distribution, amount of compaction, moisture content of the mix and type/amount of stabiliser used. Well-produced cement-stabilised rammed earth walls can be anywhere between . Higher compressive strength might require more cement. But addition of more cement can affect the permeability of the walls. Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate. Rammed earth walls are reinforced with rebars in areas of high seismic activity.

Adding cement to soil mixtures low in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices. The United States Department of Agriculture observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.

Rammed earth works require at least one skilled person for quality control. All other workers can be unskilled or semi-skilled.

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high thermal mass: like brick or concrete, it absorbs heat during the day and releases heat at night. This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for air conditioning and heating. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated by inserting insulation such as styrofoam or rigid fibreglass panels within internal and external layers of rammed earth. Depending on the type and content of binder, it must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%. The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices. This avoids problems of condensation and prevents significant loss of heat.

Rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are not used by some people because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture, which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.

Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.
The thickness varies widely based on region and code. It can be as little as for non load-bearing walls and up to for load-bearing walls. The thickness and density of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for soundproofing. They are also inherently fireproof, resistant to termite damage, and non-toxic.

==Environmental effects and sustainability==
Edifices of rammed earth are more sustainable and environmentally friendly than other building techniques that use more cement and other chemicals. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low embodied energy and generate very little waste. The soils used are typically subsoil which conserve the topsoil for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal. Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid edifices. Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than &quot;earth&quot;.

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for passive solar heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall thick.

Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy because manufacture of the cement itself creates 1.25 tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of cement produced. Although it has low greenhouse gas emissions in theory, transportation and the production of cement can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

==History==

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in Neolithic archaeological sites such as those of the Fertile Crescent, dating to the 9th–7th millennium BC, and of the Yangshao and Longshan cultures in China, dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 &quot;Hāng tǔ&quot;) were commonly used for walls and foundations in China.

===United States and Canada===
In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the United States by the book &quot;Rural Economy&quot; by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the Borough House Plantation and the Church of the Holy Cross in Stateburg, South Carolina, both being National Historic Landmarks.
An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in Canada is St. Thomas Anglican Church in Shanty Bay, Ontario, erected between 1838 and 1841.


From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. South Dakota State College extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth. For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1943, Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled &quot;Rammed Earth Building Construction&quot;. In 1936, on a homestead near Gardendale, Alabama, the United States Department of Agriculture constructed experimental rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben. The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided homes to low-income families.

The US Agency for International Development is working with developing countries to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses. It also financed the authorship of the &quot;Handbook of Rammed Earth&quot; by Texas A&amp;M University and the Texas Transportation Institute.

Interest in rammed earth declined after World War II when the cost of modern construction materials decreased. Rammed earth is considered substandard, and is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen. The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world. In Chile, for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.

A notable example of 21st-century use of rammed earth is the façade of the Nk&#x27;Mip Desert Cultural Centre in southern British Columbia, Canada. As of 2014 it is the longest rammed earth wall in North America.

=== 20th century China ===
Rammed earth construction was both practically and ideologically important during the rapid construction of the Daqing oil field and the related development of Daqing. The &quot;Daqing Spirit&quot; represented deep personal commitment in pursuing national goals, self-sufficient and frugal living, and urban-rural integrated land use. Daqing&#x27;s urban-rural landscape was said to embody the ideal communist society described by Karl Marx because it eliminated (1) the gap between town and country, (2) the gap between workers and peasants, and (3) the gap between manual and mental labor.

Drawing on the Daqing experience, China encouraged rammed earth construction in the mid-1960s. Starting in 1964, Mao Zedong advocated for a &quot;mass design revolution movement&quot;. In the context of the Sino-Soviet split, Mao urged that planners should avoid the use of Soviet-style prefabricated materials and instead embrace the proletarian spirit of on-site construction using rammed earth. The Communist Party promoted the use of rammed earth construction as a low-cost method which was indigenous to China and required little technical skill.

During the Third Front campaign to develop strategic industries in China&#x27;s rugged interior to prepare for potential invasion by the United States or Soviet Union, Planning Commission Director Li Fuchun instructed project leaders to make do with what was available, including building rammed earth housing so that more resources could be directed to production. This policy came to be expressed through the slogan, &quot;First build the factory and afterward housing.&quot;

<text>Morning care is a hygiene routine provided by personal support workers, nursing assistants, nurses, and other workers for patients and residents of care facilities each morning. The care routine typically includes washing the face, combing hair, shaving, putting on cosmetics, toileting, getting dressed, and similar activities. Nurses may also check the patients&#x27; temperature, check medical equipment, replenish IV bags, change dressings, or do other daily or semi-daily tasks at this time.

Most morning care duties are basic activities of daily living. Different people require different levels of support for morning care, depending on their performance status. Some people may be able to complete morning care with little or no support from healthcare workers, while others may require the worker to perform all the tasks completely.

Patient preferences may dictate aspects of morning care, such as the order of tasks done, the type of soap used, or whether bathing is a morning or afternoon activity.

Some basic housekeeping, such as changing bedsheets, may be done at the same time.

<doc id="513971" wikidata="Q2024069" url="?curid=513971" title="Hoylake">
<text>Hoylake () is a seaside town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. It is at the north west of the Wirral Peninsula, near West Kirby and where the River Dee meets the Irish Sea. At the 2021 census, the built up area had a population of 5,315.

In the nineteenth century, the town grew up around the small fishing village of Hoose (), a settlement that was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 within the Hundred of &#x27;Wilaveston&#x27; (historically part of Cheshire). The town takes its name from &#x27;Hoyle Lake&#x27;, a nearby channel of water out towards Hilbre Island that provided a safe anchorage for shipping.

==History==
In 1690, William III set sail from Hoylake, then known as &quot;Hyle&quot; or &quot;High-lake&quot;, with a 10,000-strong army to Ireland, where his army was to take part in the Battle of the Boyne. The location of departure remains known as King&#x27;s Gap. The previous year a large force under Marshal Schomberg had also departed from Hoylake on 12 August, crossing to Ireland to capture Carrickfergus.

The present day township grew up in the nineteenth century around the small fishing village of Hoose, 
the name of which means &quot;hollows&quot;.
The 1848 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; described the inhabitants of Hoose as:
The name Hoylake was derived from Hoyle Lake, a channel of water between Hilbre Island and Dove Point. Protected by a wide sandbank known as Hoyle Bank and with a water depth of about 20 feet, it provided a safe anchorage for ships too large to sail up the Dee to Chester.

==Landmarks==
The Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial is a notable local landmark, as it was designed in 1922 by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger who was responsible for a number of war memorials around the world, including the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London.

The former Hoylake Town Hall, on the corner of Albert Road and Market Street, is due to be converted to a new arts centre, known as The Beacon, with craft workshops, restaurant, and flats above.

Kings Gap roundabout is home to a sculpture by Scottish sculptor David Annand. Called &#x27;Knots&#x27;, it consists of seabirds looping around four poles. It was commissioned by the council as part of the regeneration of Hoylake and was installed in June 2006 in time for the 2006 Open Championship.

===Lighthouses===

To facilitate safe access into the Hoylake anchorage, two lighthouses were constructed in 1763, at the initiative of William Hutchinson. The lower light was a wooden structure that could be moved according to differing tides and shifting sands to remain aligned to the upper light, which was a permanent brick building. By the start of the 19th century each lighthouse was equipped with a single 3 ft-diameter reflector, built to Hutchinson&#x27;s design.

Both of these structures were rebuilt a century later, and in 1865 new lenses (a pair of fourth-order fixed optics) were designed and manufactured for the two towers by James Chance. 
The upper lighthouse, consisting of an octagonal brick tower, last shone on 14 May 1886 and is now part of a private residence in Valentia Road. 
The building was given Grade II listed status in 1988.
The lower lighthouse, closer to the shore in Alderley Road, was deactivated in 1908 and demolished in 1922.

===Former landmarks===
The Royal Hotel was built by Sir John Stanley in 1792, with the intention of developing the area as a holiday resort. The numerous steam packet vessels sailing between Liverpool and North Wales which called at the hotel provided valuable patronage. By the mid-19th century a racecourse was laid out in the grounds of the hotel. The hotel building was demolished in the 1950s.

Hoylake&#x27;s lido, located on the promenade, was opened in June 1913 and rebuilt in the late 1920s. In 1976, the Hoylake Pool and Community Trust took over the running of the facility from Wirral Borough Council.
The baths finally closed in 1981.

==Geography==
Hoylake is at the north-western corner of the Wirral Peninsula, and is situated on the eastern side of the mouth of the Dee Estuary and adjacent to the Irish Sea. Hoylake is approximately west-south-west of the River Mersey at New Brighton. The centre of Hoylake is situated at an elevation of about above sea level.

To the west of the town at Hilbre Point is Red Rocks, a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. The area is an exposed sandstone outcrop consisting of sand dunes, brackish marsh and reed beds.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Hoylake, at metropolitan borough level: Wirral Council. The council is a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The town forms part of the Hoylake and Meols ward for elections to Wirral Council.

For national elections, Hoylake is within the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The current Member of Parliament is Matthew Patrick, of the Labour Party.

===Administrative history===
Hoylake grew up straddling the townships of Hoose and Little Meols, which both formed part of the ancient parish of West Kirby in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including West Kirby, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Hoose and Little Meols also became civil parishes.

The population of the Hoose township or civil parish was recorded as 60 in 1801, 589 in 1851, and 1,658 in 1891.

A local government district was created in 1891, covering the townships or civil parishes of Great Meols, Hoose, Little Meols, West Kirby and part of Grange. There was a dispute about whether the district&#x27;s name should be &#x27;Hoylake and West Kirby&#x27; or &#x27;West Kirby and Hoylake&#x27;; the county council chose the latter.
Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. At the same time, the civil parishes within the district were united into a single civil parish called Hoylake-cum-West Kirby. Although the order creating the district in 1891 had put the name West Kirby first, the council took to calling the district Hoylake and West Kirby. To resolve the ambiguity, the government formally confirmed the district&#x27;s name as being Hoylake and West Kirby in 1897. The council chose to base itself in Hoylake, building Hoylake Town Hall on Market Street in 1898.

The urban district was enlarged in 1933 to take in the civil parishes of Caldy, Frankby, Grange, and Greasby. The urban district was renamed Hoylake at the same time. The urban district council was granted a coat of arms in 1960, which featured two golf clubs, representing the Royal Liverpool Golf Club.

Hoylake Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the new county of Merseyside.

==Community==

Hoylake is a largely residential area and there is an active nightlife in the town centre, which is located at the original village of Hoose.

The town supports a permanent lifeboat station, manned by the RNLI. Initially founded in 1803 by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, it is one of the oldest in the country. 
In 2008, the RNLI began to raise £2 million for a new lifeboat station and new generation all-weather lifeboat, to facilitate a faster response time to emergencies and rescues in the Irish Sea and the rivers Dee and Mersey. The building was opened in November 2009.

The Kings Gap conservation area has been designated by Wirral Borough Council. Bounded by the coastline and the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, it consists of large nineteenth and early twentieth century houses, Hoylake Lighthouse and St Hildeburgh&#x27;s Church.

==Education==
Hoylake includes the independent Kingsmead School, which educates girls and boys from 2 to 16 years old. Hoylake Holy Trinity C of E Primary School is the town&#x27;s main primary school, educating children from the ages of 3 to 11.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada, the local television station TalkLiverpool also broadcasts to the area. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. With its close proximity with North Wales, BBC Wales and ITV Cymru Wales can also be received from the Moel-y-Parc TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside, Heart North West, Capital North West &amp; Wales, Smooth North West, Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West and Wirral Wave Radio, a community based station. 

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Wirral Globe&quot; and &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;.

==Sport==
===Golf===

Hoylake is the home of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, built in 1869 on the site of the Royal Hotel racecourse. It is the second oldest golf links in England, predated only by the Royal North Devon Golf Club, in Westward Ho!, Devon. 
It has hosted many major tournaments such as the Open Championship and the Walker Cup. The club is often referred to as &quot;Hoylake&quot;. It hosted the Open again in July 2006, after a gap of almost 40 years, with Tiger Woods earning the Claret Jug for the second year in a row. The 2014 Open Championship is the 12th time the event was held at Hoylake. This was won by Rory McIlroy. The 2023 Open Championship is the most recent event to be held in Hoylake marking the 13th time it has returned to the town. This was won by Brian Harman.

Hoylake-born amateur golfer John Ball Jnr. won the Open in 1890, becoming the first Englishman to do so. Another local amateur, Harold Hilton became Open champion two years later. He won again in 1897 at his home club of Royal Liverpool.

On the other side of Meols Drive and the railway is Hoylake Municipal Golf course which is used by Hoylake Golf Club (since 1933), West Hoyle GC and Irby GC. It was used as the 2006 Open Championship practice course.

===Rugby Union===
Hoylake RFC rugby club was founded in 1922. They currently play in South Lancs/Cheshire Division One, the seventh tier of English rugby. Its predecessor, connected with the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, had been founded in the 1890s. British Open golf champion Harold Hilton was also captain of the rugby team for the 1890–91 season.

===Swimming===
Hoylake ASC was founded in 1931. The club now trains at the West Kirby Concourse and the Calday Grange Swimming Pool.

===Sailing===

Hoylake Sailing Club was founded in 1887 and has a clubhouse and boatyard on North Parade. The club hosts an annual regatta and sends a team to the Southport 24 Hour Race.

===Sand yachting===
Hoylake is one of the premier sites for sand yachting in Britain, with banks around a quarter of a mile offshore. The town&#x27;s beach was the venue for the European Sand Yacht Championships in 2007 and 2011 and hosted the 2017 event with Laytown &amp; Bettystown, County Meath.

===Cricket===
Cricket was played at the now disused Ellerman Lines Cricket Ground from as early as the 1920s, when the then newly formed West Wirral Cricket Club played at the ground. It was later sold to Ellerman Lines, who transformed the site into their social club. Cheshire played minor counties cricket there from 1957 to 1968. The ground also held Cheshire&#x27;s first ever appearance in List A cricket against Surrey in the first round of the 1964 Gillette Cup.

The ground was later sold, with the site becoming a nightclub, before being demolished following a fire. In 2011 the site of the ground was selected for construction of 62 affordable homes. Planning permission for this, and a revised plan for 26 properties, were refused. In 2020 a further planning proposal was submitted for 30 semi-detached bungalows and up to 61 assisted living retirement apartments.

==Transport==
Hoylake and Manor Road railway stations serve the town. Both are on the West Kirby branch of Merseyrail&#x27;s Wirral line.

<text>A tulku (, also tülku, trulku) is a distinctive and significant aspect of Tibetan Buddhism, embodying the concept of enlightened beings taking corporeal forms to continue the lineage of specific teachings. The term &quot;tulku&quot; has its origins in the Tibetan word &quot;sprul sku&quot;, which originally referred to an emperor or ruler taking human form on Earth, signifying a divine incarnation. Over time, this term evolved within Tibetan Buddhism to denote the corporeal existence of highly accomplished Buddhist masters whose purpose is to ensure the preservation and transmission of a particular lineage.

The tulku system originated in Tibet, particularly associated with the recognition of the second Karmapa in the 13th century. Since then, numerous tulku lineages have been established, with each tulku having a distinctive role in preserving and propagating specific teachings. Other high-profile examples of tulkus include the Dalai Lamas, the Panchen Lamas, the Samding Dorje Phagmos, Khyentses, the Zhabdrung Rinpoches, and the Kongtruls.

The process of recognizing tulkus involves a combination of traditional and supernatural methods. When a tulku passes away, a committee of senior lamas convenes to identify the reincarnation. They may look for signs left by the departed tulku, consult oracles, rely on dreams or visions, and sometimes even observe natural phenomena like rainbows. This process combines mysticism and tradition to pinpoint the successor who will carry forward the teachings of their predecessor.

A Western tulku is the recognized successor to a lama or dharma master born in the West, commonly of non-Tibetan ethnic heritage. This recognition has sparked debates and discussions regarding the cultural adaptation and authenticity of Westerners within the traditional Tibetan tulku system. Some argue that Westerners should explore their own forms of Buddhism rather than attempting to fit into this system. Western tulkus may struggle to gain recognition among laypeople and even other monastics. Generally, Western tulkus do not follow traditional Tibetan monastic life, and commonly leave their home monasteries for alternative careers, not necessarily chaplaincy.

==Etymology and meaning==
The word སྤྲུལ or &#x27;sprul&#x27; (Modern Lhasa Tibetan ) was a verb in Old Tibetan literature and was used to describe the བཙན་པོ་ btsanpo (&#x27;emperor&#x27;/天子) taking a human form on earth. So the &quot;sprul&quot; idea of taking a corporeal form is a local religious idea alien to Indian Buddhism and other forms of Buddhism (e.g. Theravadin or Zen). The term &quot;tülku&quot; became associated with the translation of the Sanskrit philosophical term &quot;nirmanakaya&quot;. According to the philosophical system of &quot;trikaya&quot; or &quot;three bodies of Buddha&quot;, nirmanakaya is the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;body&quot; in the sense of the bodymind (Sanskrit: &quot;nāmarūpa&quot;). Thus, the person of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha, is an example of nirmanakaya.

Over time, indigenous religious ideas became assimilated by the new Buddhism; e.g. &quot;sprul&quot; became part of a compound noun, སྤྲུལ་སྐུ་&#x27;sprul.sku&#x27; (&quot;incarnation body&quot; or &#x27;tülku&#x27;, and &#x27;btsan&#x27;, the term for the imperial ruler of the Tibetan Empire, became a kind of mountain deity). Valentine summarizes the shift in meaning of the word &quot;tülku&quot;: &quot;This term that was originally used to describe the Buddha as a &#x27;magical emanation&#x27; of enlightenment, is best translated as &#x27;incarnation&#x27; or &#x27;steadfast incarnation&#x27; when used in the context of the tulku system to describe patriarchs that reliably return to human form.&quot;

According to the &quot;Light of Fearless Indestructible Wisdom&quot; by Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal: the term &quot;tülku&quot; &quot;designates one who is &#x27;noble&#x27; (or &#x27;selfless&#x27; according to Buddha&#x27;s usage) and used in Buddhist texts to denote a highly achieved being who has attained the first bhumi, a level of attainment which is truly egoless, or higher.&quot; Higher Vajrayana practitioners who have attained siddhis and mastered the bardo of dying, bardo of dharmata or bardo of becoming can be reborn as a tülkus. According to Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang:

In addition to Tibet, Tibetan Buddhism is a traditional religion in China and Mongolia. The Mongolian word for a &quot;tülku&quot; is &quot;qubilγan&quot;, though such persons may also be called by the honorific title &quot;qutuγtu&quot; (Tib: &quot;&#x27;phags-pa&quot; and Skt: &quot;ārya &quot;or &quot;superior&quot;, not to be confused with the historic figure, &#x27;Phags-pa Lama or the script attributed to him, (&quot;Phags-pa&quot; script), or &quot;hutagt&quot; in the standard Khalkha dialect. The Chinese word for &quot;tülku&quot; is &quot;huófó&quot; (活佛), which literally means &quot;living Buddha&quot;.

==Grades==
Tibetans recognize at least three grades of tulku. Three of these grades as reported by Peter Bishop are:

*&quot;Low-level lamas&quot; – any monk who has been rewarded with a human rebirth
*&quot;Nearly perfected beings&quot; – these are highly skilled practitioners who intentionally reincarnate to fulfill a specific purpose or mission
*&quot;Incarnate Bodhisattvas&quot; – the fullest sense of tulku, this grade includes only the major tulku lineages such as the Karmapas, the Dalai Lamas, and the Tai Situpas.

==History==
In a strict sense, &quot;tulku&quot; is a Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot;, which refers to the &quot;transformation&quot; or &quot;emanation body&quot; of a Buddha. &quot;Tulku&quot; is therefore the physical &quot;form in which a Buddha appears to ordinary beings.&quot;

A related term in Tibetan is &quot;yangsi&quot; (literally &quot;rebirth&quot; or &quot;re-becoming&quot;) which refers to an enlightened master who has returned to earthly existence for the sake of benefitting sentient beings. While the notion of a nirmāṇakāya is found throughout Mahayana Buddhism, and is integral to the doctrine of the &quot;trikaya&quot; (&quot;Three Bodies&quot;), the concept of the &quot;yangsi&quot; is uniquely Tibetan. Tulku, as a title, refers to one who is recognized as the yangsi of a master.

It arose in the context of a political vacuum spurred by the assassination of Ralpachen, which saw monastic centers develop political power in a second spreading of Buddhism in Tibet. It had &quot;purely politico-mercantile origins and functions&quot; and later became a significant spiritual institution. However, some commentators argue that the political shift was &quot;grafted onto the tradition of recognizing reincarnations, not the other way around.&quot; Turrell V. Wylie wrote that the tulku system &quot;developed in Tibetan Buddhism primarily for political reasons&quot; while Reginald Ray argued that such a view ignores &quot;miss[es] what is perhaps its most distinctive feature&quot; which is its &quot;important ideological and religious dimensions&quot;, being &quot;deeply rooted&quot; in the &quot;bodhisattva&quot; concept.

Tulku have been associated with ruling power since its origination, expressing indigenous Tibetan notions of kingship. This system supplanted the earlier model of monastic governance, in which a celibate religious head acted as abbot, while his brother, a married administrative head, continued the family line, with his eldest son becoming the next religious head, creating an uncle-nephew system of inheritance. The first recognized tulku was perhaps Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama.

Giuseppe Tucci traced the origin of the tulku concept to Indian Vajrayana, particularly in a fragmentary biography of Maitripada he discovered in Nepal. The tulku system of preserving Dharma lineages developed in Tibet after the 12th century, with the first recognized tulku being perhaps Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama. Foreign tulkus have been identified since at least the sixteenth century, when the grandson of the Mongol Altan Khan was recognized as the 4th Dalai Lama. The Mongol conversion to Buddhism served a political function and allowed Tibet to build a closer relationship with the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. Traditionally, however, tulku were only recognized from Tibetan cultural areas, encompassing Tibet, Nepal, Mongolia, and Bhutan.

The Chinese annexation of Tibet in 1959 created massive social upheaval. This intensified during the Cultural Revolution which brought irreparable damage to the institutions and traditions which constitute Tibetan Buddhism as one of the Four Olds. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism has flourished in areas of Tibetan culture not under Chinese rule, such as Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of North India. In India, the traditional monastic system is largely intact and the tulku system remains politically relevant. Compounded with the inherent transnational character of proselytizing religions, Tibetan Buddhism is &quot;pulled between the need to adapt itself and the need to preserve itself&quot;.

Westerners began taking an interest in Tibetan Buddhism during the counterculture of the 1960s, and Tibetan Buddhism became popular among western Buddhists and they began to be recognized as incarnations of Buddhist masters around this time. Most of these, however, were expatriate Tibetans or Tibetans of mixed heritage, such as the son of Chögyam Trungpa. Initially, Westerners were not recognized as tulkus by the wider Tibetan diaspora.

The recognition of Westerners as tulkus began in the 1970s, following the spread of Tibetan Buddhism to modern Western countries such as the United States. The first recognized Western tulku was Dylan Henderson, an American boy identified as his father&#x27;s teacher, or alternatively Ossian MacLise. MacLise, however, was born in Kathmandu, Nepal.
===Lineage of the Karmapas===
Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (, 1110–1193), was a disciple of the Tibetan master Gampopa. A talented child who studied Buddhism with his father from an early age and who sought out great teachers in his twenties and thirties, he is said to have attained enlightenment at the age of fifty while practicing dream yoga. He was henceforth regarded by the contemporary highly respected masters Shakya Śri and Lama Shang as the Karmapa, a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, whose coming was predicted in the &quot;Samadhiraja Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;.

The Karmapa is a long line of consciously reborn lamas. A Karmapa&#x27;s identity is confirmed through a combination realized lineage teachers supernatural insight, prediction letters left by the previous Karmapa, and the young child&#x27;s own self-proclamation and ability to identify objects and people known to its previous incarnation.

After the first Karmapa died in 1193, a lama had recurrent visions of a particular child as his rebirth. This child (born ) was recognized as the Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama (1204–1283), thus beginning the Tibetan tulku tradition. Karma Pakshi was the first recognized tulku in Tibetan Buddhism that predicted the circumstances of his rebirth.

The 8th, 10th, and 12th incarnations, as well as the 16th Karmapa, each faced conflicts during their recognition, which were ultimately resolved. There was a controversy over the enthronement of two 17th Karmapas.

=== Lineage of the Dalai Lamas===
Gendun Drup (1391–1474), a disciple of the founder Je Tsongkapa, was the ordination name of the monk who came to be known as the &#x27;First Dalai Lama&#x27;, but only from 104 years after he died. There had been resistance, since first he was ordained a monk in the Kadampa tradition and for various reasons, for hundreds of years the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the &quot;tulku&quot; system to which the older schools adhered. Tsongkhapa largely modelled his new, reformed Gelugpa school on the Kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system. Therefore, although Gendun Drup grew to be a very important Gelugpa lama, after he died in 1474 there was no question of any search being made to identify his incarnation.

Despite this, when the Tashilhunpo monks started hearing what seemed credible accounts that an incarnation of Gendun Drup had appeared nearby and repeatedly announced himself from the age of two, their curiosity was aroused. It was some 55 years after Tsongkhapa&#x27;s death when eventually, the monastic authorities saw compelling evidence that convinced them the child in question was indeed the incarnation of their founder. They felt obliged to break with their own tradition and in 1487, the boy was renamed Gendun Gyatso and installed at Tashilhunpo as Gendun Drup&#x27;s tulku, albeit informally.

Gendun Gyatso died in 1542 and the lineage of Dalai Lama tulkus finally became firmly established when the third incarnation, Sonam Gyatso (1543–1588), came forth. He made himself known as the &quot;tulku&quot; of Gendun Gyatso and was formally recognised and enthroned at Drepung in 1546. When Gendun Gyatso was given the titular name &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; by the Tümed Altan Khan in 1578, his two predecessors were accorded the title posthumously and he became known as the third in the lineage.

=== Lineage of the Tai Situpas ===

The Tai Situpa lineage is one of the oldest tulku lineages in the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism In Tibetan Buddhism tradition, Kenting Tai Situpa is considered as emanation of Bodhisattva Maitreya and Padmasambhava and who has been incarnated numerous times as Indian and Tibetan yogis since the time of the historical Buddha.

Chokyi Gyaltsen was the first to bear the title &quot;Grand Situ&quot; (), conferred upon him in 1407 by the Yongle Emperor of Ming China. He was a close disciple of Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama, who appointed him abbot of Karma Goen, the Karmapa&#x27;s principal monastery at the time. The full title bestowed was &quot;Kenting Naya Tang Nyontse Geshetse Tai Situpa&quot; which is shortened to &quot;Kenting Tai Situ&quot;. The full title means &quot;far reaching, unshakable, great master, holder of the command&quot;.

The current Tai Situpa, Pema Tönyö Nyinje, is the 12th. He is the head of Palpung Monastery.

===Lineage of Samding Dorje Phagmo===
The Samding Dorje Phagmo () is the highest female tulku in Tibet and the third highest-ranking person in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. She was listed among the highest-ranking reincarnations at the time of the 5th Dalai Lama, recognized by the Tibetan government and acknowledged by the emperors of Qing China. In her first incarnation, as Chökyi Drönma (1422–1455 CE), she was the student and consort of the famous polymath Thang Tong Gyalpo, who first identified her as an emanation of Vajravārāhī, and the consort of Bodong Panchen. The seat of the Samding Dorje Phagmo is at Samding Monastery, in Tibet.

The current (12th) Samding Dorje Pakmo Trülku is Dechen Chökyi Drönma, who was born in 1938 or 1942. Dechen Chökyi Drönma was very young at the time of the Chinese occupation, and her exact date of birth is contested. Dechen Chökyi Drönma was recognised by the present 14th Dalai Lama as a true incarnation and served as a vice president of the Buddhist Association of China in 1956 while he was president, and Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama also as vice president. She went to Lhasa in 1958 and received the empowerment of Yamantaka from the Dalai Lama and the empowerment of Vajrayogini from the Dalai Lama&#x27;s tutor, Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso. She has been trained in the Bodongpa tradition and remains the head of the Samding Monastery. She simultaneously holds the post of a high government cadre in the Tibet Autonomous Region. She has as a result been accused of collaborating with the Chinese.
===Lineage of the Trungpa tülkus===

The Trungpa tülkus are a line of incarnate Tibetan lamas who traditionally head Surmang monastery complex in Kham, now Surmang. There have been twelve such Trungpa tulkus. They are members of the Karma Kagyu tradition as well as the Nyingma tradition. These tulkus are recognized as reincarnations of Künga Gyaltsen (15th century), a student of Trungmase.

The 11th Trungpa tulku was Chögyam Trungpa (1940–1987). He was one of the most influential teachers of Buddhism in the West and founded Shambhala Buddhism.

Choseng Trungpa Rinpoche is the 12th and current Trungpa tulku.

===Lineage of the Zhabdrung Rinpoches===
In Bhutan, the title Zhabdrung Rinpoche refers to Ngawang Namgyal (1594–1651), the founder of the Bhutanese state, or one of his successive reincarnations. Following his death, the ruling authorities in Bhutan were faced with the problem of succession. To neutralize the power of future Zhabdrung incarnations, the Druk Desi, Je Khenpo and penlops conspired to recognize not a single person but rather as three separate persons—a &quot;body incarnation&quot; (&quot;Ku tulku&quot;), a &quot;mind incarnation&quot; (&quot;Thu tulku&quot; or &quot;Thugtrul&quot;), and a &quot;speech incarnation&quot; (&quot;Sung tulku&quot; or &quot;Sungtrul&quot;). In spite of their efforts to consolidate the power established by the original Zhabdrung, the country sank into warring factionalism for the next 200 years. The body incarnation lineage died out in the mid-18th century, while the mind and speech incarnations of the Zhabdrung continued into the 20th century. The mind incarnation was the one generally recognized as the &quot;Zhabdrung&quot;.

Besides the mind incarnation, there was also a line of claimants for the speech incarnation. At the time the monarchy was founded in 1907, Choley Yeshe Ngodub (or Chogley Yeshey Ngodrup) was the speech incarnation and also served as the last Druk Desi. After his death in 1917, he was succeeded by Chogley Jigme Tenzin (1919–1949). The next claimant, unrecognized by the Bhutan government, lived at Tawang monastery in India and was evacuated to the western Himalayas during the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

Another line of claimants to be the mind incarnation of Ngawang Namgyal existed in Tibet, and was represented by Namkhai Norbu, who lived in Italy.

===Lineage of the Panchen Lamas===


The recognition of Panchen Lamas began with Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, tutor of the 5th Dalai Lama, who received the title &quot;Panchen Bogd&quot; from Altan Khan and the Dalai Lama in 1645. &quot;Bogd&quot; is Mongolian, meaning &quot;holy&quot;. Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, Sönam Choklang and Ensapa Lobsang Döndrup were subsequently recognized as the first to third Panchen Lamas posthumously.

In 1713, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty granted the title &quot;Panchen Erdeni&quot; to the 5th Panchen Lama. In 1792, the Qianlong Emperor issued a decree known as the 29-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet, and Article One of the decree was designed to be used in the selection of rinpoches, lamas and other high offices within Tibetan Buddhism, including the Dalai Lamas, Panchen Lamas and Mongolian lamas.

Traditionally, the Panchen Lama is the head of Tashilhunpo Monastery, and holds religious and secular power over the Tsang region centered in Shigatse, independent of the Ganden Podrang authority led by the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama are closely connected, and each participates in the process of recognizing the other&#x27;s reincarnations.

The current 11th Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama on 14 May 1995. Three days later, the six-year-old Panchen Lama was kidnapped by the Chinese government and his family was taken into custody. The Chinese government instead named Gyaincain Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama. Their nomination has been widely rejected by Buddhists in Tibet and abroad, while governments have called for information about and the release of the Panchen Lama. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima has never been publicly seen since 1995.

=== Lineage of Genyenma Ahkon Lhamo ===
The first Genyenma Ahkon Lhamo, a meditator recognized as a wisdom dakini was one of the main disciples of Namchö Mingyur Dorje (1645–1667) and sister of Rigdzin Kunzang Sherab, Migyur Dorje&#x27;s Dharma heir and the First Throneholder of Palyul Monastery (founded 1665). She was credited as being instrumental to the founding of Palyul (now one of the Nyingma&#x27;s six main or &quot;mother&quot; monasteries) and for leaving a relic that is important to Palyul. During the cremation of her body, her kapala (top half of the skull) is said to have flown three kilometers and come to rest at the foot of the teaching throne of her brother. Found to be miraculously embossed with the sacred syllable AH, the kapala became an important relic housed at Palyul monastery in Tibet.

The Third Drubwang Padma Norbu (&quot;Penor&quot;) Rinpoche, 11th Throneholder of Palyul Monastery, former Supreme Head of the Nyingma tradition was recognized as a tulku and brought to Palyul Monastery in 1936 at the age of four. He recounted that as a young tulku in Tibet, inspired by seeing the skull relic, he made prayers to find Ahkon Lhamo&#x27;s incarnation. Though most of the kapala relic was pulverized into dust during the Cultural Revolution, one Tibetan man managed to save a silver dollar-size piece on which the syllable &quot;AH&quot; appears. Penor Rinpoche acquired it from him on a return trip to Tibet in 1987. He had it preserved in a crystal lotus bowl.

In 1987, Penor Rinpoche officially recognized Alyce Louise Zeoli as the tulku of Genyenma Ahkon Lhamo during her visit to his Namdroling Monastery in Bylakuppe, Karnataka, India. He gave her the crystal lotus bowl containing the relic of Ahkon Lhamo just prior to the occasion of her enthronement ceremony as Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo at Kunzang Palyul Choling (KPC) in 1988. The relic remains at KPC and is displayed on auspicious days.

===Lineage of Jamgon Kongtrul===

Kongtrul tulkus are the main custodians of Jamgon Kongtrul (1813–1899). Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thayé was a Tibetan Buddhist scholar, poet, artist, physician, tertön and polymath. He is credited as one of the founders of the Rimé movement (non-sectarian), compiling what is known as the &quot;Five Great Treasuries&quot;. He achieved great renown as a scholar and writer, especially among the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages and composed over 90 volumes of Buddhist writing, including his magnum opus, &quot;The Treasury of Knowledge&quot;. There have been several recognized tulkus of Lodro Thaye.

The current lineage holder as the 4th Jamgon Kongtrul is Lodrö Chökyi Nyima. He was recognized in August 1996 by Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa, who gave the name Jamgon Lodro Chokyi Nyima Dronme Chok Thamced Le Nampar Gyalwe De. He was born on November26, 1995, in Chushur Dzong, near Chushur Dzong, in Central Tibet. This recognition was confirmed by the 14th Dalai Lama, Sakya Trizin, head of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, and Mindroling Trichen, former head of the Nyingma tradition. All three performed hair-cutting ceremonies and bestowed names, as is traditional. As the reincarnation of Jamgon Kongtrul, Lodrö is entitled to be called &quot;Rinpoche&quot;.

===Lineage of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo===

Khyentse tulkus are the main custodians of the lineage of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892), a teacher, scholar and tertön of 19th-century Tibet. He was a leading figure in the Rimé movement.

Several tulkus of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, including those of body &quot;(sku)&quot;, speech &quot;(gsung)&quot;, mind &quot;(thugs)&quot;, qualities &quot;(yon tan)&quot; and activity &quot;()&quot;, were recognized in Tibet. Of these, the body incarnation was Dzongsar Khyentse Jamyang Chökyi Wangpo, who was enthroned at Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo&#x27;s main seat at Dzongsar Monastery but died in an accident c. 1909. The activity incarnation Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö, who was originally enthroned at Katok Monastery succeeded him. The speech incarnation was the Second Beru Khyentse and the mind incarnation Dilgo Khyentse. Since the early 1960s, Dilgo Khyentse, single-handedly upholding the unique tradition of Khyentse incarnations, propagated Buddhism tirelessly in India, Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet, and the West.

===Lineage of Dudjom Lingpa===
Dudjom Lingpa (1835–1904) was a Tibetan meditation master, spiritual teacher and tertön. He stands out from the norm of Tibetan Buddhist teachers in the sense that he had no formal education, nor did he take ordination as a monk or belong to any established Buddhist school or tradition of his time.

His recognized successor, Kyabje Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, was more commonly known as Dudjom Rinpoche (1904–1987). He is considered to be the direct incarnation of Dudjom Lingpa. He was a Nyingma householder, yogi, and a Vajrayana and Dzogchen master. According to his disciple Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal, he was revered as &quot;His Holiness&quot; and as a &quot;Master of Masters&quot;.

The third Dudjom tulku, Sangye Pema Zhepa, was first recognized by terton Khandro Tare Lama through a prophetic poem written in dakini script on the day of his birth. Tare Lama wrote to Chatral Rinpoche, who confirmed the prophecy and recognized the three-year-old tulku in person. Recognitions were also conferred by the 14th Dalai Lama, Kyabje Penor Rinpoche, Sakya Trinzin Rinpoche, and others. On February 15, 2022, Dudjom Rinpoche Sangye Pema Zhepa, after telling his staff that he was going to rest and relax, suddenly died. He was 32 years of age when he passed at the Dudjom Labrang, his residence.

===Lineage of Thubten Yeshe===
Thubten Yeshe (1935–1984) was a Tibetan lama who, while exiled in Nepal, co-founded Kopan Monastery (1969) and the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (1975). He followed the Gelug tradition, and was considered unconventional in his teaching style. Lama Yeshe died in 1984, 20 minutes before dawn on the first day of Losar, the Tibetan New Year. His body was cremated at the Vajrapani Institute in Boulder Creek, California, where there is a stupa honoring him.

In 1986, after certain traditional tests, the Dalai Lama formally recognized Tenzin Ösel Hita as the &quot;tulku&quot; or reincarnation of Thubten Yeshe—making him one of only a handful of Western tulkus—and renamed him &quot;Tenzin Ösel Rinpoche&quot; (). This makes Thubten Yeshe the first in a new lineage of tulkus. As a child Ösel was heavily promoted by the FPMT, and made the subject of a book by Vicki Mackenzie, &quot;Reincarnation: The Boy Lama&quot;. He is the fifth of nine siblings.

==Process==
===Finding a successor===
Pamela Logan outlines a general approach for finding a successor:

===Training===
Logan describes the training a tulku undergoes from a young age:

The academic atmosphere is balanced by unconditional love:

== Analysis and criticism ==
According to Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, the tulku system is a method of identifying and nurturing spiritual talent, ensuring the continuity of the tradition, and controlling resources and revenue streams. He describes how the system also ensured control of valuable real estate and financial capital, making Tibetan monasteries early examples of capitalistic institutions. In an analysis of an article titled &quot;Time for Radical Change in How We Raise Our Tulkus&quot; by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, Ken McLeod relates that the tulku system is facing challenges in the modern world. Tulkus can no longer be secluded during training as they were in Tibet, and their roles are changing. There is a shift from the traditional three-year retreat, and the adoption of titles like &quot;His Holiness&quot; has become a competition among tulku lineages to establish pedigree.

The tulku system has been criticized since its inception. In the centuries following the inception of the system used to identify reincarnate lamas, the process became increasingly corrupted and politicized by those living outside monastic-ordination systems, as the process also led indirectly to sources of material wealth and power in Tibet. Highly respected teachers like the 14th Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche have bemoaned the practice as belonging to feudal times, and have advocated revamping the system in way that divorces the reincarnate teacher from administrative politics and allows them to distinguish themselves.

Criticism has also been directed against individual tulkus, including both Tibetan and Western tulkus. The validity of the recognition of Tsangyang Gyatso (born 1683) as the 6th Dalai Lama in 1697 was questioned due to the fact that he preferred a libertine lifestyle to that of an ordained monk. Living as a &quot;ngagpa&quot; (lay practitioner and yogi), he grew his hair long, dressed as a regular Tibetan, and was said to drink alcohol and enjoy the company of women.

Chögyam Trungpa, the 11th Trungpa tulku, was criticized for his unconventional teaching style, for his sexual involvement with a number of his female students, and for smoking tobacco and liberally using alcohol; many who knew him characterized him as an alcoholic. The case of Trungpa has been used as an example in calls to reform the tulku system.

The enthronement of Steven Seagal in 1997 prompted debate. Penor Rinpoche, who has recognized several Western tulku, defended his recognition of Seagal, arguing that it was not uncommon to recognize tulku late in life or for there to exist large gaps between incarnations of a tulku. Seagal is involved in the international arms trade and the government of Russia, which has prompted criticism of his title by English journalist Marina Hyde.

Tibetan tulku Sogyal Rinpoche, recognized as an incarnation of 19th-century Tibetan master and visionary Tertön Sogyal Lerab Lingpa, was accused of sexual and physical assault and abuse, as well as misusing charitable funds, with allegations stretching back to the 1970s. In 2017 his organisation, Rigpa, announced these allegations would be investigated by an outside party and on 5 September 2018, Rigpa released an independent report produced by the UK law firm Lewis Silkin LLP, which upheld most of the allegations. The case of Sogyal Rinpoche has been used as an example in calls to reform the tulku system.

Penor Rinpoche has faced criticism for having officially recognized several Western tulkus, including accusations of bestowing titles for payment, which he has denied. The current Dalai Lama is uncertain whether the recognition of Western tulkus is beneficial.

<text>Eleanor Margaret Burbidge, FRS (; 12 August 1919 – 5 April 2020) was a British-American observational astronomer and astrophysicist. In the 1950s, she was one of the founders of stellar nucleosynthesis and was first author of the influential B2FH paper. During the 1960s and 1970s she worked on galaxy rotation curves and quasars, discovering the most distant astronomical object then known. In the 1980s and 1990s she helped develop and utilise the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Burbidge was also well known for her work opposing discrimination against women in astronomy while also opposing positive discrimination.

Burbidge held several leadership and administrative posts, including director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory (1973–1975), president of the American Astronomical Society (1976–1978), and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1983). Burbidge worked at the University of London Observatory, Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago, the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of California San Diego (UCSD). From 1979 to 1988 she was the first director of the Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences at UCSD, where she worked from 1962 until her retirement.

== Research career ==
Burbidge studied at University College London (UCL), where she received an undergraduate degree in 1939 and a Ph.D. in 1943. During the Second World War, she acted as a caretaker at University of London Observatory (ULO); the wartime blackout made it easier for her to use the observatory&#x27;s telescopes. In August 1944, her observations at ULO were twice interrupted by V-1 flying bomb explosions nearby. She was turned down for a postdoctoral fellowship from Carnegie Observatories in 1945 because the job required observing at Mount Wilson Observatory, which was reserved for men only at that time. Shortly after the war, she taught astronomy at ULO to undergraduate students from across the University of London system, including Arthur C. Clarke who was then an undergraduate at King&#x27;s College London.

In 1951 she took a position at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Yerkes Observatory, Wisconsin, her first job in the United States. Her research during this period focused on the abundances of chemical elements in stars. She returned to the UK in 1953, when Margaret and her husband Geoffrey Burbidge were invited to work with William Alfred Fowler and Fred Hoyle at the University of Cambridge. The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyle&#x27;s hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions, and Fowler&#x27;s laboratory experiments on those reactions. The idea became known as stellar nucleosynthesis. They published their model in a series of papers, culminating in a magnum opus in 1957, now known as the B2FH paper after the initials of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler &amp; Hoyle. Margaret Burbidge was the first author of the paper, which was written while she was pregnant. The paper demonstrated that most heavier chemical elements were formed in stellar evolution. The theory they developed remains the fundamental basis for stellar nucleosynthesis. Fowler was later awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar) for his work on nucleosynthesis, and expressed surprise that Burbidge was not included.

When Fowler moved back to the U.S., he advised the Burbidges to come with him to California, suggesting Margaret (the observer) should re-apply for the fellowship at Mount Wilson Observatory while Geoff (the theorist) should seek the Kellogg Fellowship at Caltech. Margaret&#x27;s application was again refused on gender grounds, so the couple swapped applications. Geoff won the position at Mount Wilson, while Margaret took the Caltech job in 1955. Whenever Geoff was required to go observing on Mount Wilson, Margaret would accompany him, ostensibly as his assistant. In reality, Geoff worked in the photographic dark room while Margaret operated the telescope. When the observatory&#x27;s management found out, they eventually agreed that she could observe there, but only if she and her husband stayed in a separate self-catered cottage on the grounds, rather than the catered dormitory which had been designed for men only.

She joined the University of California San Diego (UCSD) in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s she measured the masses, compositions, and rotation curves of galaxies and performed early spectroscopic studies of quasars. Her discoveries in this area included QSO B1442+101 at a redshift of 3.5, making it the most distant known object at the time, a record which she held from 1974 to 1982. She was a supporter of the steady state theory of cosmology, but her own work on quasars helped to support the alternative Big Bang theory.

In 1972 Burbidge became director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), on secondment from UCSD. For 300 years the post had always been held by the Astronomer Royal, but when Burbidge was appointed to the RGO directorship the posts were split, with radio astronomer Martin Ryle appointed as Astronomer Royal. Burbidge sometimes attributed this to sexism, and at other times to politics intended to reduce the clout of the RGO director. Burbidge left the RGO in 1974, fifteen months after joining, due to controversy over moving the Isaac Newton Telescope from RGO headquarters at Herstmonceux Castle to Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands.

Burbidge campaigned in opposition to discrimination against women in astronomy and was also opposed to positive discrimination. In 1972 she turned down the Annie J. Cannon Award of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) because it was awarded to women only: &quot;It is high time that discrimination in favor of, as well as against, women in professional life be removed&quot;. Her letter declining the prize caused the AAS to set up its first committee on the status of women in astronomy. In 1976, she became the first female president of the AAS. During her term as president she convinced the members to ban AAS meetings in states which had not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution. In 1984 the AAS awarded her its highest honor, regardless of gender, the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship.

From 1979 to 1988, she served as the first director of the UCSD&#x27;s Center for Astrophysics and Space Science. In 1981 she was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), serving her one-year term from February 1982 to February 1983.

At UCSD she helped develop the Faint Object Spectrograph for the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in 1990. With this instrument, she and her team discovered that the galaxy Messier 82 contains a supermassive black hole at its center. As professor emerita at UCSD she continued to be active in research until the early 21st century. Burbidge authored over 370 research papers.

== Personal life==
Eleanor Margaret Peachey was born in Davenport, Stockport, UK. As a child, Margaret deduced that her birth had been exactly nine months after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War, so concluded that she was probably conceived when the armistice was announced. She was the daughter of Marjorie Stott Peachey and Stanley John Peachey; her father was a lecturer in chemistry at the Manchester School of Technology (now part of the University of Manchester) and her mother was one of his students. A few years after Margaret was born, Stanley obtained a patent related to the vulcanisation of rubber, which made enough money for the family to move to London in 1921 where he set up his own industrial chemistry laboratory. Margaret first became interested in astronomy aged 3 or 4, after seeing the stars on a ferry trip across the English Channel. By age 12, she was reading astronomy textbooks by James Jeans, a distant relative of her mother.

On 2 April 1948, Margaret Peachey married Geoffrey Burbidge. The couple had met six months earlier at University College London. Geoffrey was a theoretical physicist, but Margaret&#x27;s passion for astronomy convinced him to switch to theoretical astrophysics. The two collaborated on much of their subsequent research. The couple had a daughter, Sarah, who was born in late 1956. In 1977, Margaret became a United States citizen. Geoffrey Burbidge died in 2010. Margaret Burbidge died on 5 April 2020, in San Francisco at age 100 after a fall.

<doc id="513977" wikidata="Q380937" url="?curid=513977" title="Erik Gustaf Geijer">
<text>Erik Gustaf Geijer (12 January 1783 – 23 April 1847) was a Swedish writer, historian, poet, romantic critic of political economy, philosopher, and composer. His writings served to promote Swedish National Romanticism. He was an influential advocate of conservatism, but switched to liberalism later in life.

==Biography==
Geijer was born at Geijersgården, his family&#x27;s estate in Ransäter, Värmland. He was educated at the gymnasium of Karlstad and then attended the University of Uppsala, where he earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1806. In 1803 he had competed successfully for an historical prize offered by the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. In 1809, he traveled in England. The year following, he became a lecturer in history at Uppsala, and in 1815 assistant to Eric Michael Fant. Succeeding Fant, Geijer was a professor of history from 1817 at Uppsala University where a statue now commemorates him. He was rector of Uppsala University during the years 1822, 1830, 1836 and 1843–1844. As a representative of the university, he was a member of the Church of Sweden clergy in the Riksdag of the Estates in 1828–1830 and 1840–1841. He was a member of the Swedish Academy (on seat 14) from 1824. He was a member of the education committee from 1825 to 1828. In 1830 he joined Pro Fide et Christianismo, a Christian education society. In 1835, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Geijer was also a founding member of the Geatish Society (). In the first issue of its periodical, &quot;Iduna&quot;, appeared Geijer&#x27;s most famous poem &quot;The Viking&quot;, which described the Vikings as the heroic Norsemen that people might imagine today, and was a turning-point in the rehabilitation of Norse culture among the Swedish people. Geijer collaborated with Arvid August Afzelius, in the three volume collection of Swedish folk-songs, &quot;Svenska folk-visor från forntiden&quot; (Stockholm, 1814–1816).

Geijer was a noted historian, although he did not complete any one of the vast undertakings which he planned. Of the &quot;Records of Sweden&quot; (), which were to have embraced the history of his native country from mythical ages to his own times, he finished only the introductory volume. His &quot;Svenska folkets historia&quot; (3 vols., 1832–36), which was intended to form one of the series of European histories edited by Leo and Ukert, was not carried beyond the abdication of Queen Christina (1654), the reason probably being the author&#x27;s conversion to liberalism in history and politics. It has been suggested, however, that Geijer&#x27;s declaring for liberalism was perhaps as much coming-out-of-the-closet as it was a true conversion. Incomplete as they are, these works are highly regarded contributions to Swedish history. His &quot;History of the Swedes down to Charles X&quot; was translated into English by Turner, with biographical introduction (London, 1845).

Geijer was entrusted the task of examining and editing the papers which Gustavus III had bequeathed to the University of Uppsala, with the stipulation that they were not to be opened for fifty years after his death. In fulfillment of his charge, Geijer arranged these papers in a work which appeared in 1843-45 under the title of &quot;Gusstaf III&#x27;s efterlemnade papper&quot;, but they contained little or nothing of value.

Although he rose to fame as a nationalist author, Geijer&#x27;s views changed during his lifetime. During the last ten years of his life, he took an active part in politics, and began to advocate social reform and Liberalism. Although his political writings possess great merit, the very versatility of his powers diverted him from applying them methodically to the complete elaboration of any one subject.

In 1846 increasing ill health forced him to resign his position as professor at Uppsala. He died in Stockholm. He left some personal memoirs, &quot;Minnen&quot; (Upsala, 1834). His collected works, &quot;Samlade Skrifter&quot;, with a bibliographic treatise by Teodblad (8 vols.), appeared at Stockholm (1873–75).

==Geijersgården==

Geijersgården is a historic mansion in the centre of Uppsala, north of the University library. Geijersgården is named after Erik Gustaf Geijer, who lived there from 1837 to 1846. The main building was built between 1737 and 1738. The estate gained its present appearance around 1850.

In 1934, the estate was taken over by Uppsala University and since 1965 has housed the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation (&quot;Hammarskjöldfonden&quot;). The building was restored in the 1983 after a fire in which the building&#x27;s western parts were badly damaged. The buildings are classified as historic properties under the Swedish Cultural Monuments Act (&quot;Kulturminneslagen&quot;).

<doc id="513981" wikidata="Q2080165" url="?curid=513981" title="Hyde, Greater Manchester">
<text>Hyde is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. The built-up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics had a population of 35,895 at the 2021 census. The town lies north-east of Stockport, west of Glossop and east of Manchester.

==Toponymy==
The name Hyde is derived from the &quot;hide&quot;, a measure of land for taxation purposes, taken to be that area of land necessary to support a peasant family. In later times, it was taken to be equivalent to .

==History==
===Early history===
Newton Hall was present in the thirteenth century. Hyde was a township in the parish of Stockport. In the late 18th century, the area that was to become the town centre was no more than a cluster of houses known as Red Pump Street. Gee Cross to the south was the larger settlement at that time, with Hyde being primarily the estates of Hyde Hall on the banks of the River Tame. At the 1801 census, the Hyde township had a population of 1,063. The modern town is largely a creation of the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution.

===Industrial Revolution===
The Peak Forest Canal was constructed through Hyde, being completed in 1800. It runs from Ashton-under-Lyne to Woodley, Romiley and Marple. Captain Clarke&#x27;s Bridge, originally named &quot;Wood End Canal Bridge&quot;, is situated at the end of Woodend Lane. The bridge was erected before Captain Clarke rose to prominence and therefore probably became known as &quot;Captain Clarke&#x27;s Bridge&quot; after he retired and resided there.
The population of Hyde increased due to the success of the cotton mills during the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries; at one stage, there were 40 working mills. By 1872, only 27 remained; half of the remaining mills closed between 1921 and 1939 and there is only one working mill in the town today. There were many mill-owning families, including Sidebotham, Hibbert and Horsfield. The main employers in the mills were the Ashton family, who successfully ran a combined spinning and weaving company; most mills concentrated on one process only. The Ashton family built Hyde Chapel, on Stockport Road in Gee Cross. The Ashton Brothers&#x27; Mill has been demolished recently to make way for a housing estate.

St George&#x27;s Church was built in 1832 as a chapel of ease to St Mary&#x27;s, Stockport. It was built at the instigation of John Hyde Clarke of Hyde Hall and was the first Church of England place of worship in the town; St George&#x27;s became a parish church in 1842, with its ecclesiastical parish initially covering the whole township of Hyde. Later additions include the lychgate, boathouse by the canal, hearse house, parish rooms and numerous vicarages. The church has a tower housing eight bells and a clock.

Newton for Hyde railway station opened in 1841 on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. It was in the neighbouring township of Newton, north-east of the Market Place in Hyde. Hyde Central railway station, closer to the town centre, was opened in 1858 on a branch line.

In 1853, construction work on the Catholic St Paul&#x27;s Church in Hyde began. On 21 June 1854, the church was opened. It was designed by the noted architects Matthew Ellison Hadfield, John Grey Weightman and George Goldie in the Gothic Revival style. In 2013, it was designated a Grade II listed building.

&quot;Hyde Colliery&quot; was a coal mine in the town; in January 1889, an explosion there killed 23 miners. There was an inquiry held the following month at Hyde Town Hall. The following month, Ardwick AFC (now Manchester City) played Newton Heath (now Manchester United) under floodlights at Belle Vue to raise money for the victims&#x27; families. The game was watched by 10,000 people and this was the first floodlit match played by either side.

===20th century===
During the 1960s, Myra Hindley and Ian Brady were arrested in their home on the Hattersley estate in Hyde after police found the body of 17-year-old Edward Evans in the house. At their trial, they were found guilty of murdering Evans as well as two other children whose bodies were found buried on Saddleworth Moor several miles away.

Britain&#x27;s most prolific serial killer, Dr Harold Shipman, had his doctor&#x27;s surgery in the town where he murdered most of his several hundred victims. The first known victim was 86-year-old Sarah Hannah Marsland of Ashton House in Victoria Street on 7 August 1978 and the last was Kathleen Grundy of Joel Lane on 24 June 1998.

===21st century===

On 18 September 2012, drug dealer Dale Cregan made a hoax emergency call to the police from an address in Mottram in Longdendale, luring police constables Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, of Greater Manchester Police there by claiming that there had been an incident of criminal damage. When they arrived, he murdered them.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Hyde, at metropolitan borough level: Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. There are three Tameside wards named after Hyde: Hyde Godley, Hyde Newton, and Hyde Werneth.

The three Hyde wards all lie within the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency for national elections. The town was previously included in the Hyde constituency, which was created in 1885 and abolished in 1918 when the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency was created.

===Administrative history===
Hyde was historically a township in the ancient parish of Stockport, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Stockport, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Hyde became a civil parish.

The Hyde township was also made a local government district in 1863, administered by an elected local board. The local government district was enlarged in 1877 to take in the neighbouring townships or civil parishes of Newton (also known as Newton Moor), Godley, and the part of Werneth north of the hill of Werneth Low, which area included the village of Gee Cross. The Hyde local government district was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1881.
The borough council built Hyde Town Hall on Market Street, overlooking Market Place, to serve as its headquarters. The building was completed in 1885. The large bell in the clocktower is known as &quot;Owd Joss (Old Josh)&quot;, on account of the clock and bells having been paid for by Joshua Bradley, who had been a child worker in the mills but later rose to be a factory manager and served as a councillor.

In 1894, the part of Werneth township within the borough was added to the parish of Hyde. The borough then comprised the three urban parishes of Hyde, Godley and Newton until 1923, when they were merged into a single parish of Hyde covering the whole borough. The borough was enlarged in 1936 to take in Hattersley and part of Matley from Tintwistle Rural District.

The borough of Hyde was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

==Geography==

Werneth Low Country Park is the location of the Hyde War Memorial. The memorial is owned by a trust which raised funds from Hyde residents after the Great War to create a permanent memorial to those Hyde residents who died in that conflict. The memorial contains 710 names.

Hyde is separated from Denton by the River Tame, a tributary of the River Mersey. There are several areas and suburbs in Hyde, these include: Gee Cross, Newton, Hattersley, Godley, and Flowery Field.

==Transport==
===Buses===
Local bus services are operated predominantly by Stagecoach Manchester. Routes connect the town with Manchester city centre, Stockport, Dukinfield, Gee Cross, Woodley, Stalybridge, Ashton-under-Lyne and Oldham.

The bus station was originally built in the 1960s, with an open bus shelter design. It was rebuilt in 2007 as a much larger central terminus style building, enclosed from the outside; it opened on 23 August 2007 and cost £3.7m to build. The initiative was intended to encourage people to use public transport.

===Railway===
There are six railway stations in the Hyde area, with services operated by Northern Trains:
* Hyde Central and Hyde North stations are on the Hyde Loop line between Manchester Piccadilly and Rose Hill Marple;
* Flowery Field, Newton for Hyde, Godley and Hattersley stations are on the electrified Glossop line between Piccadilly, Glossop and Hadfield.

===Roads===
Hyde is served by the M67, which is a feeder to the M60 Manchester orbital motorway.

===Trams===
The nearest Metrolink station is in neighbouring Ashton-under-Lyne, which provides services to the city centre.

A tram network, operated by the SHMD Joint Board, ran lines through Hyde from 1904 to 1945, until their replacement by buses.

==Media==
===Television===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Reserves and Academy moved in. They used the facility as their permanent home until 2015, when a purpose-built academy stadium was opened on the campus at the Etihad Stadium. A notable appearance for Hyde United F.C. was in the FA Cup - in the 2017–18 season, they made a first round appearance in the FA Cup where they lost 4–0 to Milton Keynes Dons FC.

===Boxing===

World champion boxer Ricky Hatton was brought up on the Hattersley Estate and now lives in Gee Cross. He fought against Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, but lost on both occasions. Overall his record is 45-3, and at one point was 43–0. His association with the town led to the creation of a boxing gym and health club by Hatton Promotions.

==Leisure==

Hyde&#x27;s largest greenspace is Hyde Park, originally part of the Newton Lodge estate which was purchased by James Ashton circa 1620. The Ashton family were cotton mill owners and one of the two biggest employers in Hyde. The park was given to the Borough of Hyde by Eveline Mary Ashton and Amy Elizabeth Ashton in 1902 and opened to the public on 21 May 1904. The bandstand opened in 1922 and in 1938 Newton Lodge was demolished and replaced by Bayley Hall. The park features a garden of tranquillity, a children&#x27;s play area and a rockery.

Hyde Market has been a shopping centre for centuries. In 1994, Clarendon Square Shopping Centre opened alongside the market. Outside the shopping centre is a children&#x27;s carousel ride which celebrated its 100th birthday on 6 July 2019.
Hyde&#x27;s Festival Theatre is home to several local amateur groups presenting plays, music and dance in the downstairs auditorium or the upstairs smaller studio. There are occasional visiting professional shows.

Hyde leisure centre contains a large swimming pool with a wave machine, aqua slide and upstairs fitness suite. The octagon-shaped structure, which has been open since the 1990s, is next to Hyde United F.C.&#x27;s ground. Waldorf Playing Fields are adjacent to Matley Lane in Hyde.

Hyde also has an Air Cadet Organisation (ACO), No. 468 (Hyde &amp; Hattersley) Squadron.

Hyde Library had a gallery exhibiting the work of Harry Rutherford, an artist from the Tameside area, now at Ashton-under-Lyne.

==In popular culture==
In fiction, Hyde is mentioned frequently in the BBC drama &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. In the programme, the character Sam Tyler was said to have transferred from C Division Hyde, to the City Centre, A Division CID. The choice of Hyde is given as a clue that his 1973 self is an &quot;alter ego&quot;, as in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;.

The dance scene from the film &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979), which starred Richard Gere, was filmed in Hyde Town Hall.

<text>Hamilton College is a private liberal arts college in the Clinton, New York, area. It was established as the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in 1793 and received its charter as Hamilton College in 1812, in honor of Alexander Hamilton, one of its inaugural trustees, following a proposal made after his death in 1804. Since 1978, Hamilton has been a coeducational institution, having merged with its sister school, Kirkland College.

Hamilton enrolled approximately 2,000 undergraduate students as of the fall of 2021. The curriculum offers 57 areas of study, including 44 majors, as well as the option to design interdisciplinary concentrations. The student body consists of 53% female and 47% male students, representing 45 U.S. states and 46 countries. The acceptance rate for the class of 2026 was 11.8%. Hamilton&#x27;s athletic teams participate in the New England Small College Athletic Conference.

==History==

Hamilton College traces its origins back to 1793, when it was chartered as the Hamilton-Oneida Academy, a seminary founded by Rev. Samuel Kirkland. The academy, located in a three-story building near the Oneida Nation&#x27;s home, admitted both white and Oneida boys and was named in honor of Alexander Hamilton, who collaborated with Kirkland in starting the school and served on its first Board of Trustees. None of the Oneida boys lasted more than one year, the reason being lack of funding, along with the Oneida boys&#x27; lack of knowledge of English and their disinterest in the curriculum. It applied for a charter from the New York Board of Regents in 1805, and received it in 1812, conditional on raising an endowment of $50,000 (). Originally its location on College Hill was in the town of Paris from 1793 to 1827, then in the town of Kirkland. Clinton was not incorporated until 1843.

In 1812, pursuant to its new charter, the academy expanded its curriculum, dropped the reference to the Oneidas, and became Hamilton College, making it the third-oldest college in New York State. As the Board of Regents wanted, Hamilton started its career as a college with an endowment of $100,000 ()—a very large sum at the time. The Academy buildings, grounds, and other property were valued at $15,000. To this sum were added subscriptions and parcels of land amounting to another $50,000. The New York State Legislature granted $50,000 to the new institution, and then supported it with $3,000 per year until 1850.
According to the 1813 rules of the college, candidates for admission must be &quot;able to read, translate and parse Cicero&#x27;s select orations, Virgil, and the Greek testament, and to write true Latin in prose, and shall also have learned the rules of vulgar arithmetic.&quot;

In 1836 Hamilton had 115 students, four buildings, four professors, and the President.

In fall 1846, Zeng Laishun entered the college, and became the first Chinese college student to study abroad.

Over time, the college evolved into a more secular institution under the leadership of President M. Woolsey Stryker, who sought to distance Hamilton from its Presbyterian Church roots.

===Kirkland College===

In the second half of the 20th century, Hamilton established a women&#x27;s college, Kirkland College, on college land on the other side of College Hill Road. Though it ultimately resulted in Hamilton becoming coeducational, it lasted only about 10 years. It was perceived as less rigorous than Hamilton, although this was disputed and much discussed. The merger of the two schools, or rather the takeover by Hamilton, took place along with feelings of betrayal and lack of support from Kirkland students. On the other hand, it has been noted that Hamilton&#x27;s transition to coeducation took place &quot;more equitably&quot; than at other men&#x27;s schools, as a result of Kirkland. In the same work, &quot;women students&#x27; interests&quot; were deemed well represented in the modern Hamilton, which the author found &quot;quite remarkable.&quot;

The campus today is divided into the &quot;light side&quot; or &quot;north side&quot; (former Hamilton campus) and the &quot;dark side&quot; or &quot;south side&quot; (former Kirkland campus), separated by College Hill Road. As late as 2004, the Hamilton side was called &quot;historical&quot; and &quot;fraternity-dominated&quot;; the Kirkland side was &quot;more modern&quot; and &quot;politically progressive&quot;.

===Curtailment of fraternities===
In 1995, the college announced that all students would be required to live and eat on campus and the college bought the existing fraternity houses. At that time about a third of Hamilton students were fraternity members. While fraternities were not abolished, they were no longer as central to student life. To some extent this change reflected the negative experiences that some Kirkland and then Hamilton women had with Hamilton&#x27;s fraternities.

===21st century===
In 2002, President Eugene Tobin resigned after admitting improper attribution of quoted material in his speeches. The same year, Professor Robert L. Paquette raised objections when a student group invited Annie Sprinkle, an actress and former pornstar, as a speaker. Paquette later led an unsuccessful effort to establish the Alexander Hamilton Center on campus. The center, now known as the Alexander Hamilton Institute for the Study of Western Civilization, is located off-campus in the village of Clinton.

==Campus==
Hamilton College hosts many athletic facilities, including an ice rink, swimming pool, athletic fields, a golf practice facility, a three-story climbing wall, and a squash center. A new boathouse in nearby Rome, NY was dedicated in 2022. The area around the campus first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 Census with a population of 1,792.

All students must live on the campus. In 1995, concerned that fraternity social activities were giving the college an unfavorable reputation and driving away students, especially women, the college all but ended fraternities at Hamilton, requiring all students to live and eat on campus.

===Daniel Burke Library===

The Daniel Burke Library, designed by architect Hugh Stubbins, was finished in 1972 with a budget exceeding $5.5 million. Spanning around 80,000 square feet, it accommodates a collection of 500,000 volumes. The library serves as the home for information commons and information technology services, including a range of print and electronic resources.

===Kirner-Johnson Building===

The Kirner-Johnson Building, also known as KJ, is the hub for Hamilton&#x27;s social science departments, the Arthur Levitt Public Affairs Center, the Nesbitt-Johnson Writing Center, and the Oral Communication Center. It features a naturally illuminated commons area that serves as a gathering spot for students to study or socialize. The center of the commons is adorned with four small waterfalls, providing a gentle background noise that promotes conversation while providing acoustic insulation. The renovation and expansion project of the Kirner-Johnson building received an Award of Merit from the American Institute of Architects in 2004, and was completed in 2008.

===The Sage Rink===
Sage Rink, located at Hamilton College and constructed in 1921, is the oldest indoor collegiate hockey rink in the United States. Although Northeastern University&#x27;s Matthews Arena is older, having been initially built as a commercial arena, it was not acquired by the university until 1979. Sage Rink was funded by the widow of industrialist Russell Sage, whose name is associated with various educational buildings in Central New York, including Russell Sage College. Apart from hosting the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Continental teams, the rink has accommodated youth hockey, high school teams, adult amateur leagues, and the Clinton Comets, who enjoyed success in the semi-professional Eastern Hockey League during the 1960s and early 1970s.

===Litchfield Observatory===
Litchfield Observatory, assigned observatory code 789, was the site where German-American astronomer Christian Peters discovered approximately 48 asteroids. Although the original observatory was destroyed by fire, its legacy is commemorated on campus through the presence of its telescope mount near the Siuda Admissions and Financial Aid House. The current observatory, a quarter mile away from the main campus, operates on solar energy and provides access for student use. Constructed using rock sourced from the same quarry as the original building, the present observatory is positioned 100 feet from College Hill Road.
===Hamilton College Chapel===

The Hamilton College Chapel is a designated historical landmark and is notable for being the only remaining three-story chapel in the United States.

===Days-Massolo Center===
In 2011, Hamilton College inaugurated the Days-Massolo Center with the objective of advancing diversity awareness and facilitating dialogue among the diverse range of cultures present on campus. The center is named in honor of trustees Drew S. Days III and Arthur J. Massolo, who both made significant contributions to Hamilton College.

===The Root Glen===
The Root Glen is a wooded garden located on the premises of Hamilton College. This walking area has been developed over the course of three generations by the Root family. The Root Glen comprises both formal gardens and forest trails.

Adjacent to the Root Glen stands the Homestead, a building acquired and named by Oren Root in the 1850s. Oren and his wife Grace planted the surroundings of the building with trees, shrubs, and flowers. The property was inherited by Oren&#x27;s son, Elihu Root, who expanded the gardens. In 1937, Edward Root assumed responsibility for the garden from his father. Following her husband&#x27;s passing, Grace Root established the Root Glen Foundation with the objective of utilizing the land for educational purposes and promoting the study of birds. In 1971, the foundation dissolved, and Grace transferred ownership to Hamilton College. The maintenance of the Root Glen is overseen by the college&#x27;s horticultural grounds staff.

==Academics==
Hamilton College currently provides the Bachelor of Arts (abbreviated as A.B. or B.A.) degree across 55 fields of study.

While students are required to fulfill the courses for their chosen concentration, they have flexibility in selecting their other courses. Students must complete a quantitative and symbolic reasoning requirement, which can be satisfied through various departmental courses. Additionally, a writing requirement must be met, necessitating enrollment in at least three writing-intensive courses.

<doc id="513990" wikidata="Q3276319" url="?curid=513990" title="LaserActive">
<text>The is a converged device and fourth-generation home video game console capable of playing LaserDiscs, Compact Discs, console games, and LD-G karaoke discs. It was released by Pioneer Corporation in 1993. In addition to LaserActive games, separately sold add-on modules (called &quot;PACs&quot; by Pioneer) accept Mega Drive/Genesis and PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 ROM cartridges and CD-ROMs.

Pioneer released the LaserActive model CLD-A100 in Japan on August 20, 1993, at a cost of ¥89,800, and in the United States on September 13, 1993, at a cost of $970. An NEC-branded version of the LaserActive player known as the LD-ROM² System, or model PCE-LD1, was released in December 1993, which was priced identically to the original system and also accepted Pioneer&#x27;s PAC modules. 

==Accessories==

===PAC modules===

In the headings below, the Japanese model number occurs first, followed by the North American model number.

;Mega LD PAC (PAC-S1 / PAC-S10)
:Pioneer Electronics (USA) and Sega Enterprises released this module that allows users to play 8-inch and 12-inch LaserActive Mega LD discs, in addition to standard Sega CD discs and Genesis cartridges, as well as CD+G discs. It was the most popular add-on bought by the greater part of the LaserActive owners, costing roughly US $600. It comes with a LaserActive-branded version of Sega&#x27;s 6-button control pad (CPD-S1).

;LD-ROM² PAC (PAC-N1 / PAC-N10)
:Pioneer Electronics (USA) and NEC Home Electronics released this module that allows users to play 8-inch and 12-inch LaserActive LD-ROM² discs, as well as CD-ROM² and Super CD-ROM² discs, HuCards and CD+G discs. The Japanese version of the PAC can also run Arcade CD-ROM² discs through the use of an Arcade Card Duo. The retail price was US $600. It came with a LaserActive-branded version of NEC&#x27;s Turbo Pad (CPD-N1/CPD-N10). An NEC branded version of the LD-ROM² PAC known as the PC Engine PAC (model PCE-LP1) was also released. Due to the unpopularity of the TurboGrafx-16 in North America, very few PAC-N10 units were produced, resulting in their scarcity compared to its Sega counterpart.

;Karaoke PAC (PAC-K1 / PAC-K10)
:This PAC allows the CLD-A100 to use all NTSC LaserKaraoke titles. The front panel has two microphone inputs with separated volume controls, as well as tone control. The retail price was US $350.

;Computer Interface PAC (PAC-PC1)
:The Computer Interface PAC has an RS-232 port, enabling the CLD-A100 to be controlled by a custom software developed for a home computer. The PAC came with a 33-button infrared remote control providing more functionality than the 24-button remote included with the CLD-A100. It also included a computer program called LaserActive Program Editor on floppy disk for DOS and classic Mac OS. The floppy disks had some sample programs created with the editor for use with the first five LaserDiscs in the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; anime series.

===LaserActive 3-D Goggles===
The LaserActive 3-D Goggles (model GOL-1) employ an active shutter 3D system compatible with at least six 3D-ready LD-ROM software titles: &quot;3-D Museum&quot; (1994), &quot;Vajra 2&quot; (1994), &quot;Virtual Cameraman 2&quot; (1994), Dr. Paolo No Totteoki Video (1994), Goku (1995), and &quot;3D Virtual Australia&quot; (1996), the last software title published for the LaserActive.

They can also be used to view 3-D images from autostereograms.

A goggle adapter (model ADP-1), packaged and sold separately from the 3-D Goggles, enables the user to connect one or two pairs of goggles to the CLD-A100.

==Games==
The standard LaserActive games were on LaserDisc encoded as an LD-ROM. An LD-ROM had a capacity of 540 MB (where digital audio would have normally been stored) with 60 minutes of analog audio and video.

==Contemporary devices==
In the early 1990s, a number of consumer electronics manufacturers designed converged devices around CD-ROM technology. At the time, CD-ROM systems were expensive. The LaserActive was one of several multipurpose, multi-format, upmarket home entertainment systems with software stored on optical discs. These systems were premised on early conceptions of multimedia entertainment.

Some comparable systems are the Commodore CDTV, Philips CD-i, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and Tandy Video Information System.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in January 1994 stated that although LaserActive was &quot;a better product in many ways&quot; than 3DO, it lacked software and the NEC and Sega control packs were too expensive.

<doc id="513996" wikidata="Q5546340" url="?curid=513996" title="George William Penrose, Lord Penrose">
<text>George William Penrose, Lord Penrose, PC (born 2 June 1938), is a Scottish judge (from 1990) and member of the Privy Council (from 2000) who sat in the Court of Session, the supreme civil court.

He qualified as a chartered accountant, was admitted to the bar as an advocate and was made Senior Counsel in 1978. Between 1988 and 1990 he worked in Crown Office, the prosecution service for Scotland. He was made Scotland’s first commercial judge in 1994 and was acknowledged as an expert in commercial law. He chaired two major independent inquiries, establishing in each case complex authoritative narratives of events.

== 2004 Equitable Life inquiry ==
Lord Penrose was responsible for chairing the public inquiry that produced The Penrose Report into the near-collapse of the mutual life assurance company Equitable Life. In 2001, Lord Penrose was asked by the Treasury to investigate the history of the company. His 818-page report was published on 8 March 2004. The Report cost £2.5 million and was non-statutory, meaning in particular that it did not have powers to compel attendance. His conclusions (Chapter 19) drew attention, amongst other things, to the inadequately skilled membership of the Board and to the problem that regulatory focus on solvency did not appropriately focus on PRE (policyholders&#x27; reasonable expectations) as to final bonus. The Report detailed the history of the fund. It highlighted the long-term underlying weakness of a fund where the capital assets were unfairly held so as to benefit crystallised maturities disproportionately (Chapter 20). This inclusion of PRE as an operative part of the business that required to be supervised formed thereafter a baseline for the European Parliament Report in 2007 into lessons to be learned at the wider European level. In consequence, the 2007 Report demanded that terminal payments and liabilities across the entire European Union must be the subject of regulatory supervision and anticipatory provision. This proved to be the wider legacy of the Penrose Report. 

== 2015 Contaminated blood inquiry (Scotland) ==
Lord Penrose also headed the Penrose Inquiry into Hepatitis C &amp; HIV infections from NHS Scotland treatment with blood and blood products such as Factor VIII. The Report was described to the House of Commons in Westminster as providing &quot;the first authoritative narrative&quot; of the events in question. The House was also informed that Lord Penrose had taken 150 statements from witnesses and relatives and had considered over 118,000 documents.

== Personal ==
Lord Penrose has a son and two daughters.

<text>Baron Leconfield, of Leconfield, in the East Riding of the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1859 for Col. George Wyndham (1787–1869). He was the eldest illegitimate son and adopted heir of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (1751–1837), by Elizabeth Ilive, his future wife (see Earl of Egremont for earlier history of the family), from whom he inherited Petworth House in Sussex, Egremont Castle and Cockermouth Castle in Cumbria and Leconfield Castle in Yorkshire, all formerly lands of Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670), inherited by Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662–1748), on his marriage to the Percy heiress Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722) and inherited as one of the co-heirs of his son Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, 1st Earl of Egremont (1684–1750), by the latter&#x27;s nephew Sir Charles Wyndham, 4th Baronet (1710–1763), of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, who inherited by special remainder the earldom of Egremont. The 1st Baron&#x27;s eldest son, the second Baron, represented West Sussex in the House of Commons as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baron, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Sussex from 1917 to 1949. The latter&#x27;s nephew, the sixth Baron, served as Private Secretary to Prime Minister Harold Macmillan from 1957 to 1963. In 1963, four years before he succeeded his father in the barony of Leconfield, the Egremont title held by his ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Egremont, of Petworth in the County of Sussex. the titles are held by his son, the seventh Baron. Known as Max Egremont, he is a biographer and novelist.

The Hon. Percy Wyndham, younger son of the first Baron, was a Conservative politician and member of The Souls. He was the father of the Conservative politician and man of letters George Wyndham and of the soldier Guy Wyndham.

The family seat is Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.

<doc id="514006" wikidata="Q7662966" url="?curid=514006" title="Syon Abbey">
<text>Syon Abbey , also called simply Syon, was a dual monastery of men and women of the Bridgettine Order, although it only ever had abbesses during its existence. It was founded in 1415 and stood, until its demolition in the 16th century, on the left (northern) bank of the River Thames within the parish of Isleworth, in the county of Middlesex, on or near the site of the present Georgian mansion of Syon House, today in the London Borough of Hounslow. It was named after the biblical holy &quot;City of David which is Zion&quot; (1 Kings 8:1), built on the eponymous Mount Zion (or Sion, Syon, etc.).

At the time of the dissolution, the abbey was the wealthiest religious house in England. Syon Abbey maintained a substantial library, with a collection for the monks and another for the nuns. When Catherine of Siena&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue of Divine Revelation&quot; was translated into English for the abbey, it was given a new title, &quot;The Orchard of Syon,&quot; and included a separate prologue written to the nuns.

==Background==

Syon Abbey was built as part of King Henry V&#x27;s “The King&#x27;s Great Work” centred on Sheen Palace (renamed Richmond Palace in 1501). The royal manor of Sheen lay on the right (south), Surrey, bank of the River Thames, opposite the parish of Twickenham and the royal manor of Isleworth on the left, Middlesex, bank. Sheen had been a favourite residence of the last Plantagenet king Richard II (1377–1399) and his beloved wife Anne of Bohemia. When Anne died there of plague in 1394, Richard cursed the place where they had found great happiness and razed the palace to the ground. His throne was usurped by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, who ruled as Henry IV (1399–1413), who was involved in the murder of Richard in 1400 — and in that of Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York — and made a vow to expiate his guilt by founding 3 monasteries, which vow he died before fulfilling. The derelict palace was unfavoured by Henry IV but his son Henry V (1413–1422) saw its reconstruction as a means of emphasising the dynastic link between his own House of Lancaster and that of Plantagenet, of unquestioned legitimacy, and decided at the same time to found the three monasteries pledged by his father in one great, multi-campus building scheme, known as “The King&#x27;s Great Work”. Thus the “Great Work” commenced in the winter of 1413–14, comprising a new Sheen Palace, and nearby the following three monasteries:
*A Monastery of the Celestine Order. Established probably in Isleworth Manor. This monastery was of French monks, who refused to pray for Henry V following his warring with France, probably at Agincourt in 1415, and was therefore dissolved by the King almost immediately after its foundation. This monastery probably occupied the site in Isleworth to which Syon Monastery moved in 1431.
*The House of Jesus of Bethlehem of Sheen, of the Order of Carthusians (1414) &quot;Sheen Priory&quot;. Built within Sheen Manor, to the north of the new palace.
*The Monastery of St Saviour and St Bridget of Syon, of the Order of St Augustine (1415) &quot;Syon Monastery&quot;, the subject of this article. The first and original site of this monastery was probably almost due west of Sheen Palace, across the river, on the left bank of the Thames in Twickenham Parish.

==Foundation==
The first stone of Syon Abbey was laid by King Henry V himself on 22 February 1415, in the presence of Richard Clifford, Bishop of London. It was not until 9 days later on 3 March 1415 that the King&#x27;s founding charter was signed at Westminster. The exact location of this original plot is unknown, but it was certainly in the parish of Twickenham, the most northerly river frontage of which lies directly west across the Thames from Sheen Palace. Aungier states it is said to have been in the meadows which at the time of his publication in 1840 were the property of the Marquis of Ailsa, “formerly called &quot;Isleworth Park&quot; or &quot;Twickenham&quot; Park”. The dimensions of the plot were specified in the charter, and seem to comprise a trapezoid, the longest side of which fronted the river:

“... in a certain parcel of land of our demesne of our manor of Isleworth within the parish of Twickenham in the county of Middlesex, containing namely in length near the field towards Twickenham from a stone placed on the north side unto another stone placed on the south side 1938 ft. and in breadth towards the south from that stone placed on the south side unto the water of Thames, 960 ft. And in length by the bank of the Thames, from a stone likewise placed by the aforesaid bank at the north side to another like stone placed on the south side by the bank aforesaid, 2820 ft. And in breadth from the north side from the aforesaid stone placed on the north side from the aforesaid stone placed on the north side unto the water of the Thames, 980 ft.”

==Nomenclature==
The foundation charter states: &quot;We will and decree that it shall be called “The Monastery of St Saviour and St Bridget of Syon, of the Order of St Augustine” through all successive ages.&quot; (&quot;Monasterium&quot; in the original Latin). This name was quoted slightly differently by the Abbess and Convent in their petition of 1431 as “The Monastery of St Saviour and &quot;the Saints Mary the Virgin and&quot; Bridget of Syon of the Order of St Augustine &quot;and of St Saviour&quot;”. The funerary brass of Agnes Jordan, Syon&#x27;s last pre-reformation abbess, describes her as “Sometyme abbesse of the &quot;monasterye&quot; of Syon”.

===Biblical Sion===
There are numerous references to &quot;Sion&quot; in the Latin Bible, called &quot;Zion&quot; in the English Authorised Version, almost all of which are in the Old Testament. Mount Zion was the citadel of Jerusalem, which David captured from the Jebusites c. 1000 BC, as is clear from II Samuel, 5:7 &quot;David took the stronghold of Zion: the same is the city of David&quot;. It was there that David, 2nd King of Israel, established the capital of his kingdom of Israel, and upon which citadel it was that his son Solomon built the Temple, in which he was the dwelling place of God (II Samuel 7:6). It is thus the holiest site of Judaism and highly revered by Christians. Psalm 87:2 states &quot;The Lord loveth the gates of Zion&quot;; Joel 3:17 states &quot;I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion my holy mountain&quot;. The Romans razed the Jewish Temple to the ground in 70 AD and following the rise of Islam from 622, and the Muslim capture of the Holy Land in 636, the Muslims built on Mount Zion their Muslim shrine &quot;The Dome of the Rock&quot;, which still stands today. The Crusaders recaptured Jerusalem for the Christians in 1099 and the Knights Templar built a round church near the site of the old Jewish Temple. Following the Muslim recapture of Jerusalem a century later, the site has been unavailable for formal Jewish or Christian prayer.

==Order==

The monastery was founded “of the order of St Augustine, called St Saviour ... according to the regular institutes (i.e. regulations/rule) of the religious order by the aforesaid Bridget of Heaven inspired, founded and instituted ...” The charter previously stated the foundation to be “Especially in honour of the most holy St Bridget, who as is acknowledged by sufficient evidence, by divine inspiration founded a religious order under her name and obtained from Heaven that in whatsoever kingdom a monastery of the same religious order should be founded there peace and tranquility by the mediation of the same, should be perpetually established”. St Bridget was a visionary, and is supposed to have seen the Risen Christ, displaying his wounds. The &quot;Bridgettine order&quot; was a modified order of St Augustine, with particular devotions to the Passion of Christ and the honour of The Virgin Mary. The Bridgettines had first been brought to England from Wastein (Vadstena Abbey) in Sweden by Henry Lord Fitz-Hugh, who suggested to Henry V that he should grant the order one of his planned 3 new monastic foundations.
The Bridgettine nuns sent by Abbess Gerdeka Hartlevsdotter from the mother house Vadstena Abbey in Sweden to England were Anna Karlsdotter, Christina Finwitsdotter, Christina Esbjörnsdotter and Anna Esbjörnsdotter.

==Personnel==
The king&#x27;s original foundation followed Bridget&#x27;s rule and consisted of 85 persons. The full complement was as follows:

Women (60):
*1 abbess
*59 nuns

Men (25):
*1 confessor general
*12 priests
*4 deacons
*8 lay brethren

The different sexes were “to dwell in separate habitations, to wit the said abbess and sisters within one court by themselves and the said confessor and brothers in a separate court by themselves, within the same monastery”. The legal corporate entity was “The Abbess and Convent” which could transact business by affixing its single corporate seal. The Convent (from Latin &quot;con-venio&quot;, to come together) consisted of the Abbess and nuns together with the Confessor and all the religious men. Clearly the Abbess was the overall presiding officer.

==Abbesses==
Only eight abbesses were ever elected.
* Matilda Newton 1418–1420 (titular abbess)
* Joan North 1420–1433 (elected abbess)
* Maud Muston 1433–1447
* Margaret Ashby 1448–1456
* Elizabeth Muston 1456–1497
* Elizabeth Gibbs 1497–1518
* Constance Browne 1518–1520
* Agnes Jordan 1520–1539 (d. 29 Jan 1546)

==Burials==
*Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby
*Richard Sutton (lawyer)
*William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)

==Expansion and relocation==
Sometime before 1431 the Abbess and Convent received permission by letters patent from King Henry VI (1422–1461), the son of the founder and who was particularly favourable to Syon, having made it several grants and confirmations in rapid succession, to move the monastery to a new site of their own choosing some mile and a half downstream to a riverbank site within Isleworth parish. The land in question had been in the monastery&#x27;s ownership since 1422, in which last year of the life of Henry V had by an act of Parliament separated the manor of Isleworth from the Duchy of Cornwall and given it to Syon. The reason for the move was to gain more space, as is made clear from the letters patent:

&quot;The said Abbess and Convent had presented their humble petition setting forth that their aforesaid monastery was so small and confined in its dimensions that the numerous persons therein ... were not only incommodiously but dangerously situated...that in consequence thereof the said abbess and convent had chosen out a spot in the neighbourhood of their said priory within the said lordship of Isleworth, more meet healthful and salubrious for them to inhabit.&quot;

The &quot;danger&quot; of the situation referred to may have been due to proximity to the river, or possibly even spiritual danger to the inmates due to a too close intermingling of the sexes.

==New building==

The letters patent authorising the move, which were ratified by a grant by the king dated 1431, make clear that some of the new buildings had already been started and indeed completed:

&quot;The Abbess and convent...had begun and with great cost completed the erection of a certain edifice more spacious and convenient as well for the habitation of themselves as of the said religious brethren, which monastery so built anew and enlarged they have earnestly requested licence of us ...to consecrate and set apart as a habitation for them the said abbess and nuns and men of religion...Know ye we therefore of our pity have...permitted them...to the said mansion so chosen and by the said abbess and convent erected edified built and enlarged as aforesaid...to remove immediateley...&quot;

It seems that this building, apparently living quarters or “mansion” must have been started several years before 1431 to have been described as “completed” in the letters of patent issued before 1431

There was however another building, possibly the new Church-building itself, which still had not been completed 11 years later, by 1442, when Henry VI issued further letters patent granting the Abbess and Convent special privileges for the transport of building materials from the king&#x27;s warren in the royal manor of Sheen across the river to Isleworth:

That none of the masons, carpenters and tilers or any of their workmen or any of their materials to be employed towards the construction of the new Monastery of Syon, should be taken away by any his officers against their will.

The new site of the church building itself is now believed, after recent archaeological work, to lie partly underneath and to the east of the present Georgian mansion of Syon House. (see below: &quot;Archaeological excavations&quot;).

===Dissolution===

Following Henry VIII&#x27;s decision in 1534 to break with Rome, many of the inmates of Syon expressed themselves favourable to Henry&#x27;s supremacy over the English Church, and even converted recalcitrant monks from other monasteries to do likewise. Many however refused to acknowledge the King&#x27;s new title.

Due to the actions of one Syon monk named Richard Reynolds, an eminent doctor in divinity later canonised, the King made Syon an object of special vengeance. Reynolds had facilitated a meeting at Syon between Sir Thomas More, the King&#x27;s chief opponent in his assumption of Supreme Headship, and Elizabeth Barton, the mystic “Holy Maid of Kent” at which More was fueled with supposed divine revelations further supporting his opposition. Thomas Cromwell, the King&#x27;s minister in effecting the Dissolution, had visited Syon in person to obtain expressions of acceptance of supremacy, but seems to have met an antagonistic reception from one of the monks at the front-door grate. He left two of his agents, Thomas Bedyll and Master Leightone, to obtain the required acceptances from the nuns and monks of the King&#x27;s new status.

Bedyll reported that “the bretherne stand stif in thaire obstinacy as you left thaim”. Two were sent to the Bishop of London, within whose diocese Syon lay, apparently for a course of conversion, whilst two Church of England clerics were brought in to convert another two Syon monks who were particularly obstinate, Whitford and Little. On the following day the King himself sent four different Church of England clerics to Syon for the same purpose, again without success. The agent Bedyll then took the recalcitrant Whitford for a walk in the monastery garden to further persuade him “both with faire wordes and with foule” to convert. He then resorted to what appears a classic use of blackmail, accusing Whitford of having “used bawdy wordes to diverse ladys at the tymes of thaire confession”, which would bring him “to the greate shame of the world”. Still he did not convert, having “a brasyn forehead which shameth at no thing”. Whitford and Little were also reported, whilst hearing confessions through a hole in the wall, of persons external to the monastery, to have denounced the king&#x27;s new title as Supreme Governor, and his divorce and remarriage, for which reason it was proposed to Cromwell that the confessional grille be bricked-up.

The nuns were more easily won over however, and were sat down together in the chapter house of Syon in the presence of the Bishop of London and their own male confessor. All who accepted the king&#x27;s new title were asked to remain seated, whilst those opposed were asked to leave the chamber. All remained seated, signifying their acceptance, no doubt reluctantly. The nuns thereupon in resignation to their new status sent a special request to Cromwell that he should “be a good maister unto thaim and to thaire house, as thaire special trust is in you”. It seems they were then confident in the continuation of their monastery. One nun however named Agnes Smythe “a sturdy dame and a wylful” made a show of some resistance in persuading her sister nuns not to hand over the convent seal, which had been required by Cromwell&#x27;s agents to seal a declaration of conversion to be signed by the abbess and nuns.

On 4 May 1535 Reynolds was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn for denying the king&#x27;s supremacy, which martyrdom gained him his canonisation from Rome. The monastery finally surrendered to the king&#x27;s commissioners in 1539 and the community was expelled. The annual net revenues were then reported to be £1,731. A very large pension of £200 was given to the abbess Agnes Jordan and one of £6 each to the junior nuns. The male Confessor-General received a pension of £15, the junior monks receiving £6 to £8 each.

==Peregrination==

The expelled community, unlike many others, did not disband and separate, but exiled itself to the Netherlands. These nuns, including Elizabeth Sander and Katherine Palmer, would visit England on missions. The community were recalled briefly to Syon following the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary I (1553–1558) in 1553 when the Abbey was reestablished by a charted issued on 1 March 1557 by Cardinal Pole. Katherine Palmer was elected abbess on 31 July 1557, supported by Queen Mary. The buildings had remained intact during the interval. On the accession of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) in 1558 the Religious Houses Act 1558 (1 Eliz. 1. c. 24) was passed annexing and re-dissolving certain religious houses, including Syon, whereupon the nuns obtained royal licence to leave England, eventually settling in Lisbon, Portugal, where they arrived in 1594, after having experienced many troubles and afflictions in travels through France and Spain. While in Lisbon, they produced an illuminated petition to the King of Spain and his daughter asking for help returning to England. This petition, called the Arundel Manuscript, is now housed at Arundel Castle.

==Return to England==

The Lisbon community returned to England in 1861, settling first in Spetisbury, Dorset; moving in 1887 to Chudleigh, Devon (in a building known as Chudleigh Abbey); and then in 1925 (or 1935) to Marley House, in the parish of Rattery, South Brent, Devon. The religious community, or Abbey, of Syon thus had the distinction of being the only English one that survived the Reformation unbroken. A large piece of sculptured stonework from the monastery&#x27;s remains was returned to them ceremoniously by the Duke of Northumberland, owner of Syon House. In 2004, the remaining medieval books in the abbey&#x27;s collection were deposited for safe-keeping with the University of Exeter Library. In 2011 Syon Abbey, by now reduced to three elderly sisters, was closed and sold. The remaining sisters now live in Plymouth.

==Resting place for coffin of Henry VIII==
On 14 February 1547 the coffin of King Henry VIII lay overnight at Syon, en route from Westminster for burial in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. Twelve years before in 1535 a Franciscan friar named William Peyto (or Peto, Petow), (d.1558 or 1559), had preached before the king at Greenwich Palace “that God&#x27;s judgements were ready to fall upon his head and that dogs would lick his blood, as they had done to Ahab”, whose infamy rests upon Kings 16:33: &quot;And Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him&quot;. The prophecy was said to have been fulfilled during this night at Syon, when some “corrupted matter of a bloody colour” fell from the coffin to the floor.

==Replacement by mansion of Syon House==
After dissolution, the estate came into the possession of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector to the young Edward VI, who started work on building the first Syon House in the Italian Renaissance style, apparently incorporating the west end of the monastery church. Following the Duke&#x27;s execution for treason in 1552, it was confiscated for the Crown under Queen Mary, who briefly re-established the community there during 1557 to 1558. Her successor Queen Elizabeth I granted in 1594 a lease of the manor to Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland on his marriage to Dorothy Devereux, the younger daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, who later received a grant of the freehold from King James I in 1604. The square house seen today is a Georgian remodelling of the first house by Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland (1714–1786), in about 1760. The first Duke was born Hugh Smithson, and married Lady Elizabeth Seymour (daughter and heiress of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (d.1750), a direct descendant of Protector Somerset), whose grandmother Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722) was the heiress of the 15th and last Percy, Earl of Northumberland, from whom Syon House thus devolved onto the first Duke of Northumberland. In 1750, 10 years after his marriage, he adopted the name Percy in lieu of his patronymic.

==Archaeological excavations==
Syon House remains in 2010 the London seat of the Dukes of Northumberland. Foundations of the Monastery Church lying to the immediate east of Syon House were partially uncovered in excavations starting in summer 2003, made by Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; archaeological programme, broadcast on 4 January 2004. The programme highlighted medieval masonry blocks in the foundation wall of the north Wing as evidence that the west end of the church may have been incorporated into the current house built by Protector Somerset. However, subsequent sweeping of the floor demonstrated that the Tudor floor surface continued underneath the wall, suggesting that the medieval blocks were simply reused when this wing was rebuilt in 1820. So far there is no evidence on the exact length of the church or whether it does actually extend under Syon House. Further excavations by Birkbeck, University of London have continued from 2004 to 2011. As of 2020, it has been confirmed that some portions of the abbey remained intact and were used &quot;in situ&quot; during the construction of Syon House, most notably an undercroft forming part of the cellars of the mansion&#x27;s westerly wing and two Gothic doorways. Further remains are confirmed across the building&#x27;s lawns, including the vaults of the abbey latrine and the foundations of the majority of the abbey church.

== Syon Abbey collection ==
A substantial collection of material relating to Syon Abbey is held at the University of Exeter Special Collections. A large proportion of this collection comprises material deposited by the sisters of Syon Abbey between 1990 and the monastery&#x27;s closure in 2011, including the community&#x27;s archive, manuscripts and printed books.

<text>Baron Hungerford is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 7 January 1426 for Walter Hungerford, who was summoned to parliament, had been Member of Parliament, Speaker of the House and invested as Knight of the Order of the Garter before and was made Lord High Treasurer one year before he became a peer. The man who would later succeed as third baron was created Baron de Moleyns on 13 January 1445 by writ of summons; both titles merged when he succeeded as Baron Hungerford in 1459. The third baron was attainted and the peerage forfeit in 1461. This attainder was reversed in 1485 for the then 4th baroness of Hungerford, and so it came into the Hastings family of Earls of Huntingdon until 1789, when it came into the Rawdon(-Hastings) family of the Marquesses of Hastings until 1868 when it fell into abeyance. This abeyance was terminated three years later for a member of the Abney-Hastings family and an Earl of Loudoun. In 1920 it again fell into abeyance, which was terminated one year later for the Philipps family of the Viscounts of St Davids where it has remained since.

Another Barony of Hungerford with the distinction &quot;de Heytesbury&quot; was created in the Peerage of England on 8 June 1526 for another Walter Hungerford, who was summoned to parliament. He was attainted in 1540 and the peerage forfeited. This attainder has not been reversed since.

<text>Baron Lawrence, of the Punjab and of Grateley in the County of Southampton, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1869 for Sir John Lawrence, 1st Baronet, the former Viceroy of India. 

Lawrence had already been created a Baronet, in 1858. His son, the second Baron, served in the Conservative administrations of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour as a government whip from 1895 to 1905. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baron on 14 August 2023.

Two other members of the Lawrence family may also be mentioned. Sir Henry Lawrence, a military officer and administrator in British India, was the elder brother of the first Baron Lawrence. Charles Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence of Kingsgate, was a younger son of the first Baron.

<text>Beginner (formerly Absolute Beginner) is a German rap group from Hamburg, consisting of Jan Delay (aka Eizi Eiz/Eißfeldt), Denyo and DJ Mad. Their fourth album, &quot;Advanced Chemistry&quot;, was released in August 2016.

== Band history ==
The group was founded as Absolute Beginner in 1991, initially with six members: Jan Delay, Denyo, Mardin, DJ Burn, Nabil, Mirko, but the latter three dropped out after a few months. They started rapping in English and German with homemade beats, but later chose to rap solely in German. During their first public appearance they met DJ Mad, who immediately joined the group.

In 1993 they released their first track, &quot;K.E.I.N.E.&quot; on the sampler &quot;Kill the Nation With a Groove&quot;. The same year they released their first EP, &quot;Gotting&quot;, and embarked on their first tour.

Their first proper album &quot;Flashnizm&quot; was released in 1996, to a fairly moderate commercial success. Nevertheless, they produced a video for the single &quot;Natural Born Chillaz&quot;, which MTV refused to play, and went on tour throughout the German-speaking countries to smaller crowds. Mardin became dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s progress and left in 1997. That same year Eißfeldt founded the Underground tape label Eimsbush, references to which are interspersed in many German hip hop tracks. Eimsbush records later developed into a full-fledged independent label, producing new acts like D-Flame and Illo77, but closed down in 2003.

In 1998 they had a Top 10 hit with &quot;Liebes Lied&quot; (&quot;Dear Song&quot;, a pun on the word for love song, Liebeslied). Their album &quot;Bambule&quot; entered the top 30 of the albums chart and they released the follow-up singles &quot;Hammerhart&quot; (&quot;Hammer Hard&quot;) and &quot;Füchse&quot; (&quot;Foxes&quot;), which featured Samy Deluxe. They went on three tours with Dynamite Deluxe, Main Concept and the Beastie Boys respectively and appeared at major festivals. In 2001 the Beginners released a remix album of &quot;Bambule&quot;, called &quot;Boombule&quot;.

In 1999 Eißfeldt released his first solo reggae single, a cover version of new wave idol Nena&#x27;s &quot;Irgendwo, Irgendwie, Irgendwann&quot;. In 2001, he then released a solo reggae album, &quot;Searching for the Jan Soul Rebels&quot;. Denyo also went solo and released his album &quot;Minidisko&quot; 2001, while DJ Mad produced for other major acts and hosted a weekly radio show. They did not split, however, with Denyo and Eißfeldt going on the 60 Hz-tour together, along with Eimsbush-act D-Flame.

In 2002, after the German hip hop hype had abated, Mad, Eißfeldt and Denyo agreed to record an album together again, which became their 2003 hit album &quot;Blast Action Heroes&quot;, heralded by the Top 10 single &quot;Fäule&quot;. It rose to first place on the German albums chart, countering the downwards trend of non-mainstream music styles, which had been brought about by a number of changes in the music industry and Germany&#x27;s media landscape. Their 2003 &quot;Blast Action Heroes&quot; tour eventuated into a second leg in 2004. The first &quot;Beginner&quot; DVD was released in December 2004. After &quot;Blast Action Heroes&quot; reached number one on the German chart, they released &quot;Danke&quot;, a song thanking their fans for their support.

On 24 May 2016 group member Jan Delay announced that a new album titled &quot;Advanced Chemistry&quot; would be released on 26 August 2016. The group&#x27;s first single in 13 years, &quot;Ahnma&quot; (featuring Gzuz &amp; Gentleman), was released in June 2016.

== Music ==
The Beginners started out with highly politicized lyrics. Their first song &quot;K.E.I.N.E.&quot; attacked the German police force. Their lyrics often mix comedy and politics. Indeed, a lot of the early satire of their lyrics abated in their first commercially successful album &quot;Bambule&quot;, especially in the singles released, and some rival acts accused them of selling out. However, Eißfeldt&#x27;s reggae album has political lyrics throughout and Denyo has been engaged in the anti-racism hip hop project Brothers Keepers and &quot;Blast Action Heroes&quot; is also a thoroughly politicized album.

After a long break, the Beginners returned with a more progressive and experimental sound, turning away from their &quot;old school&quot; hip hop sound.

== Aliases ==

Jan Eißfeldt is also known as Eisfeldt65, Jan Delay (his reggae and funk name), Boba Ffett (his &quot;Style-Liga&quot; name) and Eizi Eiz (originally a character – a pretentious young rapper – in a duet with D-Flame, now his current stage name).

Denyo is also known as Denyo77, Denyo Deutschland and, simply, Dennis.

<text>Baron Lyell, of Kinnordy in the County of Forfar, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1914 for the Scottish Liberal politician Sir Leonard Lyell, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a baronet, of Kinnordy in the County of Forfar, in 1894. As his son Charles, a Liberal Member of Parliament, died on 18 October 1918 of pneumonia while serving as Assistant Military Attaché to the USA, he was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in North Africa during the Second World War. He was succeeded in the titles by his son, the third Baron, in 1943. He was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat on the Conservative benches. The titles became extinct on his death in 2017.

The first Baron Lyell was the nephew of the geologist Sir Charles Lyell, 1st and last Baronet, of Kinnordy.

<doc id="514023" wikidata="Q131482" url="?curid=514023" title="Hijrah">
<text>The Hijrah, () also Hegira (from Medieval Latin), was the journey the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his followers took from Mecca to Medina. The year in which the Hijrah took place is also identified as the epoch of the Lunar Hijri and Solar Hijri calendars; its date equates to 16 July 622 in the Julian calendar.

Early in Muhammad&#x27;s preaching of Islam, his followers only included his close friends and relatives. Most of his tribesmen, the Quraysh, however, were indifferent to his activities, as they did not appear to be particularly interested in devotional meetings, and accordingly, Muhammad did not encounter any serious opposition from them; that was the case until he began to challenge their beliefs, which caused tensions to arise.

In May 622, after having convened twice with members of the Medinan tribes of Aws and Khazraj at al-&#x27;Aqabah near Mina, Muhammad secretly left his home in Mecca to emigrate to their city, along with his friend, father-in-law and companion Abu Bakr.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Hijrah&quot; is a romanization of the Arabic word هجرة &#x27;to depart to&#x27;, &#x27;to migrate to&#x27; or &#x27;to move away from&#x27;. The first stem of the verbal root &quot;H-J-R&quot;, &quot;hajara&quot;, means &#x27;to cut off someone from friendly association; to avoid association with&#x27;; the third stem, &quot;hājara&quot;, means &#x27;a mutual termination of friendly relations by leaving or departing&#x27;. The word has been mistranslated, without proper context, as &#x27;a severing of ties of kinship or association&#x27;. Since 1753, the word has also been used to refer to an exodus in English.

== Background ==
=== Situation in Medina ===
Located more than north of Mecca, Medina is a verdant oasis. According to Muslim sources, the city was founded by Jews who had survived the revolt against the Romans. While agriculture was far from the domain of the Arab tribes, the Jews were excellent farmers who cultivated the land in the oases. In addition to several smaller Jewish clans, there were three major Jewish tribes in the city: Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir and Banu Qurayza. Over time, Arab tribes from southern Arabia migrated to the city and settled alongside the Jewish community. The Arab tribes comprised Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj, both known collectively as Banu Qayla. Prior to 620, these two Arab tribes had been fighting for nearly a hundred years. Each of them had tried to court the support of the Jewish tribes, which occasionally led to infighting among the latter.

=== Muhammad&#x27;s encounters with Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj ===
In 620, having lost all hope of winning converts among his fellow townspeople, Muhammad limited his efforts to non-Meccans who attended fairs or made pilgrimages. During these efforts, Muhammad met six members of the Banu Khazraj tribe who were visiting Mecca, on a pilgrimage to the holy sites around the city. These six individuals had a history of raiding Jews in their locality, who in turn had warned them that a prophet would come, and with his help, the Jews would obliterate them. Upon hearing Muhammad&#x27;s religious message, the six individuals said to each other, &quot;This is the very prophet of whom the Jews warned us; don&#x27;t let them get to him before us!&quot; After embracing Islam, they returned to Medina and shared their encounter, hoping that by having their people—the Khazraj and the Aws, who had been at odds for so long—accept Islam and adopt Muhammad as their leader, unity could be achieved between them.

In February 621, five earlier converts met with Muhammad again. They were accompanied by seven new converts, including two people from the Banu Aws tribe. This gathering took place at the al-&#x27;Aqaba mountain pass, located just north of Mecca near the trade route. At the meeting, they took a pledge to Muhammad, known as the &quot;pledge of women.&quot; It was so called because it contained no obligation to fight for Islam. One of the main tenets of this pledge was to renounce idols and affirm Allah as the only deity, with Muhammad as their leader. Muhammad then entrusted Mus&#x27;ab ibn Umayr to accompany them on their return to Medina to promote Islam.

In the pilgrimage season of 622, Muhammad had another meeting in Aqaba with the Medinan converts; this time, there were 75 of them, including 2 women. Muhammad&#x27;s uncle al-Abbas, who accompanied him, made a speech at the beginning, declaring that Muhammad was &quot;the most respected person among his kinsmen.&quot; This is quite in contrast with the fact that Muhammad had received strong opposition from his other uncle, Abu Lahab, as well as Abu Jahl and other Quraysh leaders. Al-Abbas also falsely stated that Muhammad had rejected offers from all but the men of Medina in an apparent attempt to create a sense of exclusivity and importance among them. Historical records, however, show that they were among the last groups Muhammad had tried to approach and that he had no other offers available.

Muhammad himself then spoke and invited their allegiance, asking them to protect him as they would their women and children. One of them, al-Bara, readily agreed, emphasizing the military prowess of his people. The other however, Abu al-Haytham, expressed concern that if they took the pledge and severed their ties with the Jews, Muhammad would return to his people after they gave him victories. Muhammad assured them that he was now one with them and would share their fate in war and peace. Twelve delegates, three from the Aws and nine from the Khazraj, were then selected to oversee the implementation of this pact. When the group inquired about the reward for their loyalty, Muhammad simply replied, &quot;Paradise.&quot; They then took the oath, also known as the pledge of war.

== Migration ==

Not long after receiving the pledges, Muhammad instructed his Meccan followers to relocate to Medina. The whole departure spanned about three months. To ensure that he did not arrive in Medina alone while his followers remained in Mecca, Muhammad chose not to go ahead and instead stayed behind to watch over them and persuade those who were reluctant. Some of the Quraysh tried to dissuade their family members from leaving, but in the end, there were no Muslims left in Mecca. Muhammad regarded this migration as an expulsion by the Quraysh.

Islamic tradition relates that, in light of the unfolding events, one of the Quraysh chiefs, Abu Jahl, Muhammad&#x27;s childhood friend-turned-enemy, proposed a joint assassination of Muhammad by representatives of each Quraysh clan. Having been informed of this by the angel Gabriel, Muhammad asked his cousin Ali to lie on his bed covered with his green hadrami cloak, assuring him that it would keep him safe. Muhammad then went with Abu Bakr to a cave in Mount Thawr, about an hour&#x27;s walk south of Mecca, and hid there. Abu Bakr&#x27;s children and servants, who were still in Mecca, regularly brought them food. After three days in hiding, they set out for Medina on camels that Abu Bakr had bought in advance, and accompanied by a guide, Abdallah ibn Arqat, who was a pagan.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
Muhammad&#x27;s followers suffered from poverty after fleeing persecution in Mecca and migrating with Muhammad to Medina. Their Meccan persecutors seized their wealth and belongings left behind in Mecca. Beginning in January 623, Muhammad led several raids against Meccan caravans travelling along the eastern coast of the Red Sea. Members of different tribes were thus unified by the urgency of the moment. This unity was primarily based on the bonds of kinship.

The second Rashidun Caliph, Umar ibn Al-Khattab, designated the Muslim year during which the Hegira occurred the first year of the Islamic calendar in 638 or the 17th year of the Hegira. This was later Latinized to &quot;Anno Hegirae&quot;, the abbreviation of which is still used to denote Hijri dates today. Burnaby states that: &quot;Historians in general assert that Muhammad fled from Mecca at the commencement of the third month of the Arabian year, Rabi &#x27;u-l-awwal. They do not agree as to the precise day. According to Ibn-Ishak, it was on the first or second day of the month;&quot;

Several Islamic historians and scholars, including Al Biruni, Ibn Sa&#x27;d, and Ibn Hisham, have discussed these dates in depth.

<text>Charles Edward Merrill (October 19, 1885 – October 6, 1956) was an American philanthropist, stockbroker, and co-founder, with Edmund C. Lynch, of Merrill Lynch (previously called Charles E. Merrill &amp; Co.).

==Early years==
Charles E. Merrill, the son of physician Dr. Charles Morton Merrill and Octavia (Wilson) Merrill, was born in Green Cove Springs, Florida, where he spent his early childhood. In 1898 the family briefly moved to Knoxville, Tennessee but within the year returned to Florida to settle in Jacksonville. After the school had been damaged in the Great Fire of 1901, his parents decided to send him to the college preparatory academy operated by John B. Stetson University (now known as Stetson University). Merrill studied there from 1901 until 1903 and then in 1903 for the final year of high school was transferred to Worcester Academy. After two years at Amherst College, Merrill spent time at the University of Michigan Law School from 1906 to 1907; worked at Patchogue-Plymouth Mills from 1907 to 1909; at George H. Burr &amp; Co., New York City, from 1909 to 1913; then established Charles E. Merrill &amp; Co.

==Merrill Lynch==
Merrill and his friend, Edmund C. Lynch, created Merrill Lynch in 1915. Merrill made his money by investing. He orchestrated the 1926 merger which created the Safeway food chain, and Merrill Lynch provided investment banking services to Safeway to finance the acquisition of other chains, growing Safeway to more than 3,500 stores across the United States by 1931.

Merrill anticipated the stock market crash of 1929, and divested many of his holdings before the Great Depression. Merrill merged his retail brokerage and wire operations with E. A. Pierce and Co., thereby restructuring Merrill Lynch and Co. to focus upon investment banking. Additionally, Merrill was known to have pleaded with President Calvin Coolidge (like Merrill, an Amherst alumnus) to speak out against speculation, but Coolidge did not listen to him.

Following the 1930 restructuring, Merrill was able to spend more time focusing upon the further growth of Safeway, where he remained the largest shareholder and de facto CFO; in time, his son-in-law and grandson would also run the firm. Merrill was also a major investor in the S. S. Kresge Corporation, the forerunner of Kmart.

In 1939, immediately preceding the boom caused by World War II, Merrill was approached by Edward A. Pierce to merge the struggling brokerage E. A. Pierce &amp; Co. back together with Merrill Lynch. Merrill agreed to do so, but insisted that the combined firm retain the Lynch name. Following a simultaneous acquisition of Philadelphia-based Cassatt &amp; Co., the firm was reopened as Merrill Lynch, E. A. Pierce and Cassatt. Merrill was convinced that the average American who wanted to invest should be able to buy shares in the stock market, which was previously a playground for the wealthy. He instructed his employees to hold seminars at which husbands and wives could leave their children with child care providers while the parents learned how they, too, could invest. Requiring husbands and wives to attend investment seminars together is a common marketing strategy to keep up sales pressure, as neither spouse will be able to say, &quot;let me check with my wife (or husband) before I decide.&quot;

==Personal life and family==
Merrill was a well-known &quot;bon vivant&quot;. Married three times, Merrill was nicknamed &quot;Good Time Charlie&quot; by his friends and was described in 1998 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as a &quot;short, self-absorbed, prideful, flamboyant fellow&quot; who &quot;made the gossip pages as regularly as the financial pages&quot;. Merrill was known for his many extramarital affairs, which he referred to as &quot;recharging my batteries&quot;.

In 1926, he purchased the James L. Breese House at Southampton in Suffolk County, New York, a 30-acre estate also known as &quot;The Orchard&quot;. Designed in part by Stanford White with original landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 after being divided into 29 luxury condominiums (with its ballroom and first-floor reception areas left intact).

In the 1920s, Merrill also owned a Greenwich Village townhouse at 18 West 11th Street which was exploded by dynamite on March 6, 1970 by careless Weather Underground terrorists.

All three of Merrill&#x27;s children were wealthy from unbreakable trusts made early in childhood. Merrill was the father of educator and philanthropist Charles E. Merrill Jr. (1920–2017), author and founder of the Thomas Jefferson School (St. Louis, Missouri), Commonwealth School, and former chairman of the board of trustees of Morehouse College; San Francisco philanthropist Doris Merrill Magowan (1914–2001); and poet James Merrill (1926–1995), who created the Ingram Merrill Foundation to support writers and the arts. In the early 1950s, Merrill&#x27;s three children renounced any further inheritance from their father&#x27;s estate in exchange for $100 &quot;as full quittance&quot;; as a result, 95% of Charles Merrill&#x27;s $25 million estate (he had already donated &quot;The Orchard&quot; to Amherst, which had in turn sold it) would benefit hospitals, churches, and educational causes.

Merrill&#x27;s grandson, Peter Magowan, was President and CEO of Safeway Inc. and also the former managing general partner of the San Francisco Giants.

==Other affiliations==
Merrill&#x27;s estate funded the Charles E. Merrill Trust, an engine of philanthropy, supporting the Merrill Science Center at Amherst College and Merrill College at the University of California, Santa Cruz, built in 1968.

Merrill was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1976.

Merrill played no role in Judge John M. Woolsey&#x27;s decision admitting &quot;Ulysses&quot; into the United States, as many have assumed. The Charles Merrill who assisted Woolsey was Charles Edmund Merrill Jr., president of the New York textbook publishing house, Charles E. Merrill Company. See Birmingham, &quot;The Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses&quot; (2014).

<text>The Hafele–Keating experiment was a test of the theory of relativity. In 1971, Joseph C. Hafele, a physicist, and Richard E. Keating, an astronomer, took four cesium-beam atomic clocks aboard commercial airliners. They flew twice around the world, first eastward, then westward, and compared the clocks in motion to stationary clocks at the United States Naval Observatory. When reunited, the three sets of clocks were found to disagree with one another, and their differences were consistent with the predictions of special and general relativity.

==Overview==
===Kinematic time dilation===
According to special relativity, the rate of a clock is greatest according to an observer who is at rest with respect to the clock. In a frame of reference in which the clock is not at rest, the clock runs more slowly, as expressed by the Lorentz factor. This effect, called time dilation, has been confirmed in many tests of special relativity, such as the Ives–Stilwell experiment and others. Considering the Hafele–Keating experiment in a frame of reference at rest with respect to the center of the Earth (because this is an inertial frame), a clock aboard the plane moving eastward, in the direction of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, had a greater velocity (resulting in a relative time loss) than one that remained on the ground, while a clock aboard the plane moving westward, against the Earth&#x27;s rotation, had a lower velocity than one on the ground.

===Gravitational time dilation===

General relativity predicts an additional effect, in which an increase in gravitational potential due to altitude speeds the clocks up. That is, clocks at higher altitude tick faster than clocks on Earth&#x27;s surface. This effect has been confirmed in many tests of general relativity, such as the Pound–Rebka experiment and Gravity Probe A. In the Hafele–Keating experiment, there was a slight increase in gravitational potential due to altitude that tended to speed the clocks back up. Since the aircraft flew at roughly the same altitude in both directions, this effect was approximately the same for the two planes, but nevertheless it caused a difference in comparison to the clocks on the ground.

===Results===
The results were published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1972:

The published outcome of the experiment was consistent with both special and general relativity. The observed time gains and losses were in agreement with relativistic predictions to within the ~10% precision expected of the experiment.

==Historical and scientific background==
In his original 1905 paper on special relativity, Albert Einstein suggested a possible test of the theory: &quot;Thence we conclude that a spring-clock at the equator must go more slowly, by a very small amount, than a precisely similar clock situated at one of the poles under otherwise identical conditions.&quot; Actually, it is now known that all clocks located at sea level on the Earth&#x27;s surface tick at the same rate, regardless of latitude, because kinematic and gravitational time dilation effects cancel out (assuming that Earth&#x27;s surface is an equipotential one). The kinematic effect was verified in the 1938 Ives–Stilwell experiment and in the 1940 Rossi–Hall experiment. General relativity&#x27;s prediction of the gravitational effect was confirmed in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. These experiments, however, used subatomic particles, and were therefore less direct than the type of measurement with actual clocks as originally envisioned by Einstein.

Hafele, an assistant professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, was preparing notes for a physics lecture when he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation showing that an atomic clock aboard a commercial airliner should have sufficient precision to detect the predicted relativistic effects. He spent a year in fruitless attempts to get funding for such an experiment, until he was approached after a talk on the topic by Keating, an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory who worked with atomic clocks.

Hafele and Keating obtained $8000 in funding from the Office of Naval Research for one of the most inexpensive tests ever conducted of general relativity. Of this amount, $7600 was spent on the eight round-the-world plane tickets, including two seats on each flight for &quot;Mr. Clock.&quot; They flew eastward around the world, ran the clocks side by side for a week, and then flew westward. The crew of each flight helped by supplying the navigational data needed for the comparison with theory. In addition to the scientific papers published in &quot;Science&quot;, there were several accounts published in the popular press and other publications.

==Repetitions==
A more complex and precise experiment of this kind was performed by a research group at the University of Maryland between September 1975 and January 1976. Three atomic clocks were brought to an altitude of 10 km above Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, and three other atomic clocks were at the ground. A turboprop plane was used, flying at only 500 km/h, in order to minimize the velocity effect. The plane was steadily observed using radar, and its position and velocity were measured every second. Five flights were carried out, each of 15 hours duration. Special containers protected the clocks from external influences such as vibrations, magnetic fields, or temperature variations. The time difference was measured by direct clock comparison at the ground before and after the flight, as well as during the flight by laser pulses of 0.1 ns duration. Those signals were sent to the plane, reflected, and again received at the ground station. The time difference was observable during the flight, before later analysis. An overall difference of 47.1 ns was measured, which consisted of the velocity effect of −5.7 ns and a gravitational effect of 52.8 ns. This agrees with the relativistic predictions to a precision of about 1.6%.

A reenactment of the original experiment by the National Physical Laboratory took place in 1996 on the 25th anniversary of the original experiment, using more precise atomic clocks during a flight from London to Washington, D.C. and back again. The results were verified to a higher degree of accuracy. A time gain of was observed, compared to a relativistic prediction of 39.8 ns. In June 2010, the National Physical Laboratory again repeated the experiment, this time around the globe (London - Los Angeles - Auckland - Hong Kong - London). The predicted value was , the measured value .

Because the Hafele–Keating experiment has been reproduced by increasingly accurate methods, there has been a consensus among physicists since at least the 1970s that the relativistic predictions of gravitational and kinematic effects on time have been conclusively verified. Criticisms of the experiment did not address the subsequent verification of the result by more accurate methods, and have been shown to be in error.

== Similar experiments with atomic clocks==
Measurements in which the only effect was gravitational have been conducted by Iijima et al. between 1975 and 1977. They carried a commercial cesium clock back and forth from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Mitaka, at above sea level, to Norikura corona station, at above sea level, corresponding to an altitude difference of . During the times when the clock stayed at Mitaka, it was compared with another cesium clock. The measured change in rate was (29±1.5)×10−14, consistent with the result of 30.7×10−14 predicted by general relativity.

In 1976, Briatore and Leschiutta compared the rates of two cesium clocks, one in Turin above sea level, the other at Plateau Rosa above sea level. The comparison was conducted by evaluating the arrival times of VHF television synchronization pulses and of a LORAN-C chain. The predicted difference was 30.6 ns/d. Using two different operating criteria, they found differences of 33.8±6.8 ns/d and 36.5±5.8 ns/d, respectively, in agreement with general relativity. Environmental factors were controlled far more precisely than in the Iijima experiment, in which many complicated corrections had to be applied.

In 2005, van Baak measured the gravitational time dilation of a weekend at 5400&#x27; ASL on Mount Rainier using two ensembles of three HP 5071A cesium beam clocks. He repeated the experiment in 2016 on Mount Lemmon for the television show &quot;Genius by Stephen Hawking&quot;.

In 2010, Chou et al. performed tests in which both gravitational and velocity effects were measured at velocities and gravitational potentials much smaller than those used in the mountain-valley experiments of the 1970s. It was possible to confirm velocity time dilation at the 10−16 level at speeds below 36 km/h. Also, gravitational time dilation was measured from a difference in elevation between two clocks of only .

Presently both gravitational and velocity effects are routinely incorporated, for example, into the calculations used for the Global Positioning System.

<text>The Association for Progressive Communications (APC) is an international network of organizations that was founded in 1990 to provide communication infrastructure, including Internet-based applications, to groups and individuals who work for peace, human rights, protection of the environment, and sustainability. Pioneering the use of ICTs for civil society, especially in developing countries, APC were often the first providers of Internet in their member countries.

APC is a worldwide network of social activists who use the internet to make the world a better place. APC is both a network and an organisation. APC members are groups working in their own countries to advance the same mission as APC. APC has more than 59 members, mostly in Asia, Africa and Latina America, from five continents. This is a challenge and a strength, because members are at the two extremes of internet development (members in South Korea with incredible connectivity and members in rural Nigeria where they have to power computers using car batteries and solar power) and in between.

==History==
===Background and creation ===
APC was founded in 1990 by:

* Institute for Global Communications (IGC), San Francisco, USA
* GreenNet, London, United Kingdom
* IBASE, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
* Nicarao, Managua, Nicaragua
* Pegasus Networks, Byron Bay, Australia
* Web Networks, Toronto, Canada
* NordNet, Sweden

The activists working with United Nations–sponsored data management NGO (IDOC) create a network of like-minded organisations working with information and alternative media. At this point they communicated mainly using fax and regular mail. People physically travelled around transporting and sharing databases of information and software on disks.

In 1988, on the verge of APC creation, Mitra Ardron describes the central characteristic of the future APC user, present operations and the history of APC precedents: PeaceNet, EcoNet and GreenNet. He also expresses a common commitment to global communication available to everyone.

===UN status===
Collaboration between APC and the United Nations began in 1992, in preparation for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), more popularly known as the Earth Summit. As APC had the only international, civil society communications network in existence at that time, the UNCED secretariat published their information in APC conferences. They had no other way of distributing information so economically and so effectively. (The UN itself began distributing information by electronic means many years later). 
Email links are set up between Cuba and APC networks. They call the Cuban servers three times a day to deliver and collect email.

The cooperation continues over the years. APC received consultative status to the UN with the several quadrennial reports submitted over the years. APC also cooperated with United Nations Development Programme. APC actively participate in UN initiatives such as Millennium Development Goals. The studies of violence against women and ICTs in ten countries and how legislation or lack of it hinders or helps women were conducted and published as a part of promoting gender equality and empowering women.

The APC Women&#x27;s Networking Support Programme (APC - WNSP) co-coordinated a women&#x27;s network to bring an NGO perspective to the UN Beijing +5 review. Official declarations promote ICT as a way of enhancing NGO participation in global media policy making. It also gives recommendations for women&#x27;s portrayal, decision making and advocacy in media industry.

===Late 1990s===

APC made a significant impact in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean by providing civil society organisations with email and e-information using the Fidonet gateways. Fidonet protocol was used because it is store-and-forward technology enabling people to compose and read email offline which is very important in the countries with the pour infrastructure (phone lines, electrical supply and hardware).

APC&#x27;s African networks faced with the strong competition from commercial providers, held an Africa Strategy Development Meeting from February 8–11, 1997 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The meeting attended 34 APC members and partner networks from all over Africa. The program areas, action framework and plan as well as women&#x27;s program were discussed. A powerful statement from the meeting was published as The Holy Family Communiqué from African Electronic Communicators.

A legal threat to freedom of information online came from the company Biwater and involved APC member LabourNet, April 1997. Thirteen APC members mirrored the threatened content.

===2000–2003===

2000 was a turning point for APC. The new vision statement drafted at an APC council meeting held in Piriapolis, Uruguay hosted by the Third World Institute (ITeM): &quot;APC works to achieve a world in which all people have easy, equal and affordable access to the creative potential of the internet to improve their lives and create more democratic and egalitarian societies.&quot;.

In May 2001, APC and partners started work on building a portal which collects training materials related to ICT for social change. This portal, named Itrain Online, is an entry point for finding the best computer training resources on the web for the social change and development.

The first APC Internet Rights Charter was published in three languages: English, French and Spanish. The themes: internet access for all, freedom of expression and association, access to knowledge, shared learning and creation, privacy, governance and rights were addressed.

APC started Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development in the Information Society (GenARDIS) in 2002. This project was launched to provide small grants for the agricultural initiatives by women. The access to new information and communication technologies affected rural men and women and improved agricultural production.

The ICT policy handbook for beginners was published in 2003 together with a tri-lingual ICT policy training for civil society curriculum which includes a special section on advocacy for positive policy change.

APC stimulated multi-stakeholder dialogue as part of the Catalysing Access to ICTs in Africa (CATIA) programme, and trained 100 technology enthusiasts in Africa to set up community wireless networks.

===2004–2008===
Take Back The Tech!, a 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (25 Nov - 10 Dec), started in 2006. This campaign engages information and communication technology in helping end gender-based violence.

APC joined Internet Governance Forum for the first time in 2008. A statement to IGF open consultations was submitted before the third IGF supporting regional IGF meetings and giving suggestions about themes and content of the meeting in Hyderabad.

The first edition of Global Information Society Watch was published, focused on citizen participation in ICT policy processes in the wake of the World Summit on the Information Society. These reports are accessible yearly and are a joint initiative with the Humanist Institute for Development Cooperation Hivos.

The other activities included replication of the community wireless training developed in Africa in Latin America and the Caribbean, forming an eighteen-country network connecting indigenous communities, rural backwaters and impulsing university networking courses, the first Feminist Tech Exchange, training people from 680 organisations in technology for social change and ICT policy from 2004-2008, organizing a press conference in Tunisia to address the host government&#x27;s suppression of free speech in the wake of the second World Summit on the Information Society, launching GenderIT.org.

=== 2009–2012 strategic plan and progress===
APC priorities for 2009–2012 period were: advocate for affordable internet for all, make technology work to sustain environment, use emerging technology for social change, build collaborative open online space, secure and defend internet rights and improve internet and other governance.

The strategic plan was realized by
* launching Internet Rights and Human Rights project, 
* starting research on the real lived experiences of women around the internet and sexuality, 
* publishing Global Information Society Watch: 2010 addressed the pressing issues of ICTs and climate change and e-waste, a dedicated edition on a defence of human rights and women&#x27;s rights workers working online, GISWatch 2012 focused on the Internet and corruption, as well as 2 updates to GISWatch 2011: Update 1 and Update II,
* designing a manual called &quot;Communicating research for influence: Strategies and challenges for bringing about change&quot; based on their success stories and challenges in communicating research for influence, 
* developing a practical guide to sustainable IT. It offers a detailed, &quot;hands-on&quot; introduction to thinking about sustainable computing holistically; starting with the choices you make when buying technology, through to the software and peripherals you use, how you store and work with information, manage your security, save power, and maintain and dispose of your old hardware.

The Dominican government chooses APC&#x27;s Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM) as a tool to design and evaluate their ICT policies.

The eleventh face-to-face APC council meeting is held on Panglao Island in the Philippines, hosted by the Foundation for Media Alternatives. Over one hundred communications activists also attend a Networking and Learning Forum to strategise for an open, fair and sustainable internet.

=== 2013–2016 strategic plan and progress===

The second strategic plan was released defining five priorities for 2013–2016: securing and defending internet access and rights, fostering good internet governance, strengthening use and development of transformative technology, ending technology-based violence against women and girls and strengthening APC community networks.

The realization of this plan included the following:
* Global Information Society Watch was published on communication rights ten years after the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).
* APC co-organised the second (2014) and third (2015) editions of the African School on Internet Governance, with graduates from more than 15 African countries.

==Actions==
===Gender evaluation methodology (GEM)===
The Gender Evaluation Methodology is an evaluation methodology that integrates a gender analysis into evaluations of initiatives that use information and communications technologies (ICTs) for social change. It is an evaluation tool for determining whether ICTs are really improving or worsening women’s lives and gender relations, as well as for promoting positive change at the individual, institutional, community and broader social levels. It was first developed in 2002 and was tried and tested by thirty community-based organisations. Since then hundreds of people have become involved in GEM&#x27;s development including people who developed the tool, who train in how to use GEM, who are adapting GEM to increase its applicability to rural ICT4D projects, telecentres, software localisation and ICT policy advocacy and who are now offering GEM evaluations on a consultancy basis. The GEM manual was written in English and has been translated into French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Arabic). GEM was developed by the APC Women&#x27;s Rights Programme (APC WRP

===2013 DDoS Attack===
Beginning at 10.15 BST on Thursday 1 August 2013 GreenNet, and consequently APC, suffered an extensive DDoS attack. The attack was later described as a &quot;DNS reflection attack&quot; also known as a spoofed attack Several sources linked the attack to the Zimbabwe Elections, held a day earlier. GreenNet&#x27;s services were not fully operational again until 10.30 BST on Thursday 7 August. On the 9th of August there was a second attack, which, while affecting some systems, allowed GreenNet to discover the site which was being targeted. In October 2013, the target was revealed to be the site of British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings.

<doc id="514037" wikidata="Q1427489" url="?curid=514037" title="Quebec Bridge">
<text>The Quebec Bridge () is a road, rail, and pedestrian bridge across the lower Saint Lawrence River between Sainte-Foy (a former suburb that in 2002 became the arrondissement Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge in Quebec City) and Lévis, in Quebec, Canada. The project failed twice during its construction, in 1907 and 1916, at the cost of 88 lives and additional people injured. The bridge eventually opened in 1919.

The Quebec Bridge is a riveted steel truss structure and is long, wide, and high. Cantilever arms long support a central structure, for a total span of , still the longest cantilever bridge span in the world. (It was the all-categories longest span in the world until the Ambassador Bridge was completed in 1929.) It is the easternmost (farthest downstream) complete crossing of the Saint Lawrence River.

The bridge accommodates three highway lanes (there were none until 1929, when one was added; another was added in 1949 and a third in 1993), one rail line (two until 1949), and a pedestrian walkway (originally two). At one time, it also carried a streetcar line. Since 1993, it has been owned by the Canadian National Railway.

On 15 May 2024, the Quebec Bridge was purchased by the Federal Government for a symbolic $1.

The Quebec Bridge was designated a National Historic Site in 1995.

==Background==
Before the Quebec Bridge was built, the only way to travel from the south shore of the St. Lawrence in Lévis to the north shore at Quebec City was to take a ferry or to use the wintertime ice bridge. The construction of a bridge over the St. Lawrence River at Quebec was considered as early as 1852. It was further discussed in 1867, 1882, and 1884. After a period of political instability during which Canada had four prime ministers in five years, Wilfrid Laurier, the Member of Parliament for the federal riding of Quebec East, was elected on a Liberal platform in 1896 and led the push to build the Quebec Bridge until he left office in 1911.

A March 1897 article in the &quot;Quebec Morning Chronicle&quot; noted:
The bridge question has again been revived after many years of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but a small part of the work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.

==First design and collapse of 29 August 1907==
 The Quebec Bridge was included in the National Transcontinental Railway project, undertaken by the federal government. The Quebec Bridge Company was first incorporated by Act of Parliament under the government of Sir John A. Macdonald in 1887, later revived in 1891, and revived for good in 1897 by the government of Wilfrid Laurier, who granted them an extension of time in 1900.

In 1903, the bond issue was increased to $6,000,000 and power to grant preference shares was authorised, along with a name change to the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company (QBRC). An Act of Parliament the same year was necessary to guarantee the bonds by the public purse. Laurier was the MP for Quebec East riding, while the president of the QBRC, Simon-Napoleon Parent, was Quebec City&#x27;s mayor from 1894 to 1906 and simultaneously served as Premier of Quebec from 1900 to 1905.

Edward A. Hoare was selected as Chief Engineer for the Company throughout this time, while Collingwood Schreiber was the Chief Engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals in Ottawa. Hoare had never worked on a cantilever bridge structure longer than . Schreiber was assisted until 9 July 1903 by Department bridge engineer R.C. Douglas, at which time Douglas was deposed for his opposition to the calculations that were submitted by the contractors. Schreiber subsequently requested the support of another qualified bridge engineer, but was effectively overruled by the Cabinet on 15 August 1903. Thereafter, QBRC consulting engineer Theodore Cooper was completely in charge of the works. On 1 July 1905, Schreiber was demoted and replaced as deputy minister and chief engineer by Matthew J Butler.

By 1904, the southern half of the structure was taking shape. However, preliminary calculations made early in the planning stages were never properly checked when the design was completed. The bridge’s own weight was far in excess of its carrying capacity. The dead load was too heavy. All went well until the bridge was nearing completion in the summer of 1907, when the QBRC site engineering team under Norman McLure began noticing increasing distortions of key structural members already in place.

McLure became increasingly concerned and wrote repeatedly to QBRC consulting engineer Theodore Cooper, who at first replied that the problems were minor. The Phoenix Bridge Company officials claimed that the beams must already have been bent before they were installed, but by 27 August it had become clear to McLure that this was wrong. A more experienced engineer might have telegraphed Cooper, but McLure wrote him a letter, and went to New York to meet with him two days later. Cooper agreed that the issue was serious, and promptly telegraphed to the Phoenix Bridge Company: &quot;Add no more load to bridge till after due consideration of facts.&quot; The two engineers went to the Phoenix offices.

But, Cooper&#x27;s message was not passed on to Quebec before it was too late. Near quitting time on the afternoon of 29 August, after four years of construction, the south arm and part of the central section of the bridge collapsed into the St. Lawrence River in 15 seconds. Of the 86 workers on the bridge that day, 75 were killed and the rest were injured, making it the world&#x27;s worst bridge construction disaster. Of these victims, 33 (some sources say 35) were Mohawk steelworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal; they were buried at Kahnawake under crosses made of steel beams.

On 30 August 1907, a Royal Commission of inquiry into the disaster was provisionally appointed by the Deputy Minister in charge of the Department of Railways and Canals (Butler), with the concurrence of the Minister. The Royal Commission, which was granted by Edward VII by advice of his Governor General, Albert Grey, on 31 August 1907, consisted of three members, who were all engineers of good standing: Henry Holgate, of Montreal, JGG Kerry, of Campbellford, Ontario, also an instructor at McGill University, and Professor John Galbraith, then dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering at the University of Toronto. The Commission document conferred upon the commissioners full powers to summon witnesses and documents, and to express &quot;any opinion they may see to express thereon&quot;.

The Commissioners presented their Report in full on 20 February 1908, issued 15 conclusions, and included the hindsight work of consulting bridge engineer C.C. Schneider, of Philadelphia (a fulfillment of the 1903 request of Schreiber, supra).

The Commissioners attributed responsibility for the failure to two men, consulting engineer Theodore Cooper and Peter L. Szlapka, Chief Designing Engineer for Phoenix Bridge Company:
(c) The design of the chords that failed was made by Mr. P.L. Szlapka, the designing engineer of the Phoenix Bridge Company

(d) This design was examined and officially approved by Mr. Theodore Cooper, consulting engineer of the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company.

(e) The failure cannot be attributed directly to any cause other than errors in judgment on the part of these two engineers.
Cooper escaped penal sanction. It is presumed that Szlapka escaped as well. The Commissioners also found that:
(k) The failure on the part of the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company to appoint an experienced bridge engineer to the position of chief engineer was a mistake. This resulted in a loose and inefficient supervision of all parts of the work on the part of the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company. 
The abortive construction of the Quebec Bridge spanned the careers of two Ministers of Railways and Canals, and one temporary replacement, who was on the job for five months immediately preceding the disaster. A popular myth is that the iron and the steel from the collapsed bridge, which could not be reused for construction, was used to forge the early Iron Rings that started to be worn by graduates of Canadian engineering schools in 1925.
==Second design and collapse of 11 September 1916==
After a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the collapse, construction started on a second bridge. Three engineers were appointed: H. E. Vautelet, a former engineer for the Canadian Pacific Railways, Maurice FitzMaurice from Britain, who worked on the construction of the Forth Bridge, and Ralph Modjeski from Chicago, Illinois. Vautelet was President and Chief Engineer. The new design was again for a bridge with a single long cantilever span but with a more massive structure.

On 11 September 1916, when the central span was being raised into position, it fell into the river, killing 13 workers. The chief engineer had been made aware of the problem six weeks before the collapse. The chief engineer had been alerted to a problem by Frants Lichtenberg, the engineer responsible for the construction of the centre section. Lichtenberg was also working as an inspector for the federal government of Canada at the time. Fears of German sabotage were reported because the Great War had begun, but it became apparent that the central span had collapsed because of the failure of a casting in the erection equipment.

Re-construction began almost immediately after the accident, and the government granted special permission for the bridge builders to acquire the needed steel. It was in high demand because of the War effort. The fallen central span still lies at the bottom of the river. After the bridge was completed in 1917, special passes were required for those wanting to cross the bridge. Armed soldiers, and later Dominion Police, guarded the structure and checked passes until the end of the War.

==Completion==
Construction was ultimately completed in September 1917 at a total cost of $23 million and the lives of 88 bridgeworkers. On 17 October, the first train crossed the bridge from Quebec to Lévis and on 3 December 1917, the Quebec Bridge officially opened for rail traffic, after almost two decades of construction. Its centre span of 549 m (1800 ft) remains the longest cantilevered bridge span in the world and is considered a major engineering feat. The Quebec Bridge was declared an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1987 by the Canadian and American Society of Civil Engineers.

==Post-completion history==

The bridge was built and designed primarily as a railway bridge, but the streetcar lines (used by Quebec Railway, Light &amp; Power Company) and one of the two railway tracks were converted into automobile and pedestrian/cycling lanes in subsequent years. In 1970, the Pierre Laporte Suspension Bridge opened just upstream to accommodate freeway traffic on Autoroute 73.

On 24 November 1995, the bridge was declared a National Historic Site.

The bridge has been featured on two commemorative postage stamps, one issued by the Post Office Department in 1929, and another by Canada Post in 1995.

The bridge was built as part of the National Transcontinental Railway, which was merged into the Canadian Government Railways and later became part of the Canadian National Railway (CN). The Canadian Government Railways company was maintained by the federal government until 1993, when a Privy Council order dated 22 July authorized the sale of Canadian Government Railways to the Crown corporation CN for one Canadian dollar. On that date, the Quebec Bridge also came under complete ownership of CN. CN was privatized in November 1995, making the bridge privately owned.

Despite its private ownership, CN received federal and provincial funding to undertake repairs and maintenance on the structure. Its railway designation is mile 0.2 subdivision Bridge.

==Aftermath of the collapse==

The disaster showed the power an engineer could have in a project that was improperly supervised. As one result, Galbraith and others formed around 1925 what are now recognized as organizations of Professional Engineers (P.Engs). Professional Engineers are under different rules and regulations based on the organization to which they belong. General guidelines include that an engineer must pass an ethical examination, be able to show good character through the use of character witnesses, and have applicable engineering experience (in Canada that constitutes a minimum of four years&#x27; practice under a certified Professional Engineer). Moreover, engineers must be registered in the province in which they work. These engineering organizations are regulated by the respective provinces and the title &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; (or &quot;Ingénieur&quot; in Quebec) is reserved only to members who belong to this organization.

On 29 August 2006, a year-long commemoration was begun in the Kahnawake Reserve for the lives of the 33 Mohawk men who died in 1907. One year later, on 29 August 2007, memorial services were held to dedicate a concrete structure displaying the victims&#x27; names on the Lévis side of the bridge, and to unveil a steel replica of the bridge in Kahnawake.

== Corrosion and maintenance ==

In 2015, the Quebec Bridge was included in a list of the 10 most endangered historic sites in Canada by the National Trust of Canada because of long-overdue paint and repair work.

In May 2016, Jean-Yves Duclos, the Canadian federal cabinet minister in charge of the Quebec region, revealed that a lease agreement between the CN and the federal government indicated that the CN would not be required to pay more than $10 million towards the paint work until the lease expires in 2053. The Canadian government is now proposing to invest $75 million to paint the bridge and is asking the Quebec provincial government to step in and invest an estimated additional $275 million to complete the work. The mayor of Quebec City, Regis Labeaume, accused the federal government of breaching a promise made during the 2015 electoral campaign to act upon the maintenance of the bridge 

==Government repurchase==
On 10 May 2024, the Canadian Government and CN announced an agreement for the sale of the bridge for the symbolic sum of $1. The government committed to spending $1 billion over 25 years on repairs and maintenance. CN and the Quebec government will share ownership of the rails and roadway that cross the bridge.

<text>On older personal computer motherboards, the southbridge is one of the two chips in the core logic chipset, handling many of a computer&#x27;s input/output functions. The other component of the chipset is the northbridge, which generally handles high speed onboard communications. 

A southbridge chipset handles functions such as USB, audio, the system firmware, the lower speed PCI/PCIe buses, the IOAPIC interrupt controller, the SATA storage, the historical PATA storage, the NVMe storage, and low speed buses such as ISA, LPC, SPI, and/or eSPI. Different combinations of southbridge and northbridge chips are possible, but these two kinds of chips are designed to work together. There is no industry-wide standard for interoperability between different core logic chipset designs. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the interface between a northbridge and southbridge was the PCI bus. As of 2023, the main bridging interfaces used are Direct Media Interface (Intel) and PCI Express (AMD).

The southbridge typically implements the slower capabilities of the motherboard in a northbridge-southbridge chipset computer architecture. In systems with Intel chipsets, the southbridge has been named I/O Controller Hub (ICH) and later replaced by Platform Controller Hub chipsets. In older Intel/AMD architectures the southbridge is usually linked to the northbridge, which in turn connected to the CPU. Circa 2004 and onward Intel architectures started to link southbridge directly to the CPU (e.g. via Direct Media Interface). Through the use of controller-integrated channel circuitry, the northbridge (or CPU itself) can directly link signals from the I/O units to the CPU for data control and access.

As of 2024, most personal computer devices based on Intel or AMD architectures no longer use a set of two chips, and instead have a single chip acting as the &#x27;chipset&#x27;, for example Intel&#x27;s Z790 chipset, and a central processing unit.

==Current status==
Due to the push for system-on-chip (SoC) processors, modern devices increasingly have the northbridge integrated into the CPU die itself; examples are Intel&#x27;s Sandy Bridge and AMD&#x27;s Fusion processors, both released in 2011. 

With the Intel 5 Series chipset in 2008, the southbridge became redundant and was replaced by the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) architecture introduced. AMD did the same with the release of their first APUs in 2011, naming the PCH the fusion controller hub (FCH), which was only used on AMD&#x27;s APUs until 2017 when it began to be used on AMD&#x27;s Zen architecture while dropping the FCH name. 

On Intel platforms, all southbridge features and remaining I/O functions are managed by the PCH, which is directly connected to the CPU via the Direct Media Interface (DMI). Intel low-power processors (Haswell-U and onward) and ultra low-power processors (Haswell-Y and onward) also integrate an on-package PCH. Based on its Chiplet design, AMD Ryzen processors also integrated some southbridge functions, such as some USB and SATA/NVMe interfaces.

== Etymology ==
The name is derived from representing the architecture in the fashion of a map and was first described as such with the introduction of the PCI Local Bus Architecture in 1991. At Intel, the authors of the PCI specification viewed the PCI local bus as being at the very centre of the PC platform architecture (i.e., at the Equator).

The northbridge extends to the north of the PCI bus backbone in support of CPU, memory/cache, and other performance-critical capabilities. Likewise the southbridge extends to the south of the PCI bus backbone and bridges to less performance-critical I/O capabilities such as the disk interface, audio, etc.

The CPU is located at the top of the map at due north. The CPU is connected to the chipset via a fast bridge (the northbridge) located &quot;north&quot; of other system devices as drawn. The northbridge is connected to the rest of the chipset via a slow bridge (the southbridge) located &quot;south&quot; of other system devices as drawn.

Although the current PC platform architecture has replaced the PCI bus backbone with faster I/O backbones, the bridge naming convention remains.

== Functionality ==

The functionality found in a contemporary southbridge includes:
* PCI bus. A south bridge may also include support for PCI-X.
* Low speed PCI Express (PCIe) interfaces usually for Ethernet and NVMe.
* ISA bus or LPC bridge. ISA slots are no longer provided on more recent motherboards. The LPC bridge provides a data and control path to the super I/O (the normal attachment for the PS/2 keyboard and mouse, parallel port, serial port, IR port, and floppy controller).
* SMBus controller.
* DMA controller. The 8237 DMA controller allows ISA or LPC devices direct access to main memory without needing help from the CPU.
* PIC and I/O APIC.
* Mass storage interfaces such as SATA, M.2, and historical PATA. This typically allows attachment of hard drives or SSDs.
* Real-time clock.
* Programmable interval timer.
* High Precision Event Timer.
* ACPI controller or APM controller.
* SPI serial bus mostly used for firmware (e.g., BIOS/UEFI) flash storage access.
* Nonvolatile BIOS memory. The system CMOS (BIOS configuration memory), assisted by battery supplemental power, creates a limited non-volatile storage area for BIOS configuration data.
* Intel HD Audio or AC&#x27;97 sound interface.
* USB interfaces.

Optionally, a southbridge also includes support (onboard discrete chip or southbridge-integrated) for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, RAID, Thunderbolt, and Out-of-band management.
