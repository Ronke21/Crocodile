<text>Marc Joseph John Crawford (born February 13, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and coach. He played as a forward for the Vancouver Canucks in the National Hockey League (NHL). Crawford won the Stanley Cup in 1996 as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche in the NHL. He has also been the head coach of the Quebec Nordiques, Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings, Dallas Stars, and interim head coach of the Ottawa Senators. He has also coached in Switzerland, having two tenures at the helm of the ZSC Lions, at the international level, as head coach of Team Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Crawford has won the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as coach of the year in the American Hockey League and the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in the NHL.

==Early life==
Crawford was born in Belleville, Ontario. He is the son of professional hockey player Floyd Crawford. He is the brother of National Hockey League (NHL) hockey players Bob Crawford and Lou Crawford.

==Playing career==
Crawford played three seasons of major junior in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Cornwall Royals. During this time, the team won back-to-back Memorial Cups and was named the team&#x27;s captain. Crawford was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft in the fourth round, 70th overall. He joined the Canucks in 1981–82. As a rookie, Crawford was a part of Vancouver&#x27;s 1982 run to the Stanley Cup finals, in which the Canucks were defeated by the New York Islanders.

During his six seasons in the NHL, Crawford would split time between Vancouver and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Fredericton Express. As a result of constantly flying between the two cities, which are over apart, he earned the nickname &quot;747&quot;, though most contemporary Canucks fans know him as &quot;Crow&quot;, a nickname coined during his tenure as a head coach with the team. In total, Crawford tallied 19 goals, 31 assists and 50 points in 176 games during his NHL career, all of it with Vancouver. After a season in the International Hockey League with the Milwaukee Admirals, Crawford retired as a professional player.

==Coaching career==

===Early coaching career===
Crawford was named a playing assistant coach with Fredericton during the 1987–88 season. During the 1988–89 season Crawford joined the Milwaukee Admirals as an assistant coach. He became a head coach in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Cornwall Royals, for whom he had previously played in the QMJHL. After two seasons with Cornwall, Crawford moved to the AHL, and in his first season with the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, he took his team to the 1992 Calder Cup finals, losing to the Adirondack Red Wings. The following season, Crawford was awarded the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as the AHL&#x27;s coach of the year.

In 1994–95, Crawford broke into the NHL with the Quebec Nordiques and as a result of the Nordiques&#x27; improved play, he won the NHL&#x27;s Jack Adams Award as coach of the year. He is the youngest NHL coach and first rookie coach in history to win the Jack Adams. The next season, the Nordiques franchise was relocated to Colorado as the Avalanche, and Crawford won his first and only Stanley Cup as a coach in 1996, defeating the Florida Panthers in four games in the finals.

Crawford continued to post successful regular seasons with the Avalanche in the next two seasons, but after an early first-round exit in the 1998 playoffs, he resigned on May 27, 1998. Despite reportedly being offered a one-year contract extension by general manager Pierre Lacroix, Crawford decided to &quot;move on and accept a new challenge&quot;.

Before his resignation with the Avalanche, Crawford was also the head coach of the Canadian Olympic hockey team at the 1998 Olympics, where they finished a disappointing fourth. Many questioned his choice of players to take part in the semi-final shootout with the Czech Republic, in which they lost, electing not to use future Hall of Famers Wayne Gretzky or Steve Yzerman.

===Vancouver Canucks===
After a brief stint as a colour commentator on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, Crawford replaced Mike Keenan as head coach of the Vancouver Canucks midway through the 1998–99 season. Joining Vancouver in the midst of a rebuilding period for the franchise, Crawford slowly developed the Canucks into a successful regular season team, playing a fast-paced and offensively emphasized style of play. After one-and-a-half seasons, he led Vancouver back to the playoffs. However, the Canucks were defeated in the first round by his former team, Colorado.

In 2002–03, Vancouver continued to improve under Crawford and posted a franchise record (since surpassed) of 104 points. The following season, they took the Northwest Division title from the Avalanche, who had finished first in their division every season since they won the Northeast Division during their last season playing in Quebec. Despite Vancouver&#x27;s regular season success, they only managed to win one playoff series during Crawford&#x27;s tenure. After the Canucks&#x27; failure to make the playoffs in the 2005–06 season, Crawford&#x27;s position as head coach was terminated by management on April 25, 2006. He was replaced by Alain Vigneault.

In six-and-a-half seasons&#x27; work with the Canucks, Crawford marked himself as the longest-serving and winningest head coach in franchise history at the time of his exit, coaching 529 games and 246 wins. On February 3, 2006, one of his last games in Vancouver, he also became the third-youngest head coach in NHL history to reach 400 wins. At 48 years and 342 days, this mark trails only Scotty Bowman and Glen Sather.

===Later years===
Nearly one month after being fired by Vancouver, Crawford was hired by the Los Angeles Kings, a team in a similar situation to that of the Canucks when Crawford first joined them. On June 10, 2008, Crawford was fired by the Kings, although he had one year remaining on his initial contract. He lasted only two years with the Kings, who thought a change was necessary in the coaching position. During his two seasons with the Kings, he missed the playoffs both times.

During the 2008–09 season, Crawford did colour commentary for &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; late games alongside play-by-play announcer Mark Lee.

A year after being fired from the Los Angeles Kings, Crawford was hired by Dallas Stars general manager Joe Nieuwendyk to replace previous head coach Dave Tippett. The Stars fired Crawford on April 12, 2011, two days after the Stars&#x27; loss to the Minnesota Wild in the last game of the season, which ultimately cost the team the opportunity to capture the eighth playoff berth in the Western Conference. Crawford&#x27;s tenure again only lasted two seasons.

In mid-2012, Crawford was named the new coach of the ZSC Lions of the Swiss National League A, having signed a two-year contract. He won the NLA championship with the Lions in the 2013–14 season. In March 2014, he signed a two-year contract extension. In early 2015, Crawford was responsible for convincing coveted draft prospect Auston Matthews to sign and play with the Lions for the 2015–16 season. Crawford was awed by Matthews&#x27; play during the 2015 U18 Championships and contacted Matthews&#x27; family and agent about a contract. Crawford would lead the Lions to winning the 2016 Swiss Cup. Crawford left ZSC when his contract expired in 2016. Besides winning the 2014 Swiss championship and 2016 Swiss Cup, he also guided the Lions to three NLA regular season championship titles, in 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16.

In May 2016, following the hiring of Guy Boucher, Crawford was hired as associate coach for the Ottawa Senators. On March 1, 2019, Crawford became the interim head coach of the Senators following the firing of Guy Boucher for the rest of the 2018–19 season going 7–10–1. D. J. Smith was then hired as the Senators head coach for the 2019–20 season.

On June, 4, 2019 the Chicago Blackhawks announced Crawford as an assistant coach to Jeremy Colliton. Colliton was fired by the Blackhawks during the 2021–22 season, but Crawford was retained as an assistant to interim-coach Derek King for the remainder of the season. In May 2022, Crawford was let go by the Blackhawks with a year remaining on his contract.

In December 2022, Crawford returned to Switzerland and the ZSC Lions, replacing fired coach Rikard Grönborg. In February 2023, Crawford was suspended for a game after an investigation by the National League into whether he had directed a homophobic slur at a referee. In the 2023–24 season he won the Swiss championship for a second time in his career.

The Lions were again leading the National League standings on December 30, 2024, when Crawford suddenly announced his resignation from the club, citing mental health reasons.

==Head coaching record==
==Moore incident==

On February 16, 2004, when Crawford was coach of Vancouver, Colorado player Steve Moore concussed Vancouver captain Markus Näslund on a questionable hit. No penalty was called on the play, and the NHL later reviewed the incident and decided no penalty was warranted. However, Crawford was vocal about the incident and the failure of the NHL to respond. During another game against Colorado on March 8, 2004, Todd Bertuzzi grabbed and punched Moore from behind, and rode him into the ice, causing Moore to suffer three broken vertebrae and multiple facial lacerations, which ultimately ended his career. According to a Colorado player, Crawford was laughing at the situation at the time it occurred and was the subject of substantial criticism following the incident.

Crawford, along with Bertuzzi and the Canucks organization, were named as defendants in a $19+ million (US) lawsuit by Moore. According to the suit, following the February 16 incident, Crawford encouraged his players to seek revenge, which led in part to the injury to Moore. Specifically, Moore alleged that Crawford, Bertuzzi and former general manager Brian Burke entered into &quot;an unlawful plan and agreement to assault, batter and injure Moore at a future date for the injuries that Näslund had suffered during the Feb. 16 game&quot;. The Canucks were fined US$250,000 by the NHL for &quot;...failure to prevent the atmosphere that may have led to the incident&quot;. As the case approached trial in 2014, Moore increased the damages claim to $68 million. In August 2014, the lawsuit concluded with all parties agreeing to a confidential settlement.

== Abuse of players and apology==
In December 2019, multiple former players Crawford coached in the past came forward with stories of abuse, including Brent Sopel, Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan, Harold Druken and Sean Avery. Sopel clarified it was not his intention &quot;to make any allegations against anyone or any organization&quot;, and Avery also offered support for Crawford.

The Chicago Blackhawks suspended Crawford from his role as assistant coach following these allegations and opened an investigation. Crawford subsequently issued an apology to past players that brought forward stories of abuse.

<text>Rubén Urrutia (born May 7, 1967), better known as Ruben DJ, is a Puerto Rican former rap star who became famous in the late 1980s with the hit song &quot;La Escuela&quot;.

== Career ==

Rubén was interested in dancing and music from an early age. When he was a teenager, he began singing at local parties in the Luis Lloréns Torres and Torres de Sabana housing projects. When he was 15 years old, PepsiCo made him an offer to sing and dance, but his mother declined it since he was a minor.

Rubén was working as a griller at a restaurant, called &quot;Ponderosa&quot;, when he decided to call X-100, a local radio station, to ask them if they would play one of his tapes. When they did, promoter Zaida Morales was impressed and offered him a record deal. Rubén then quit his job and dedicated fully to music. He said in an interview &quot;I quit my job, had problems at home, I spent six months promoting all over Puerto Rico with the same cap, the same pants; I lost my car, I had a Datsun that was all junk. It was tough.&quot;

Rubén DJ&#x27;s album was produced by Rubén DJ and DJ Joel and released in 1989, and the song &quot;La Escuela&quot; became an instant hit in Puerto Rico. At the moment, underground rap music was becoming popular in the island and Rubén&#x27;s song, along with Vico C, Brewley MC, and others, is considered to be among the most influential ones for the genre. &quot;La Escuela&quot; was a motivational song, encouraging children to stay in school, which broadened its appeal to the general public.

Ruben DJ himself became a celebrity nationwide in Puerto Rico, appearing on the covers of magazines, television shows, and newspapers.

<text>Akbar II (; 22 April 1760 – 28 September 1837), also known as Akbar Shah II, was the nineteenth Mughal emperor from 1806 to 1837. He was the second son of Shah Alam II and the father of Bahadur Shah II, who would eventually succeed him and become the last Mughal emperor.

Akbar had little de facto power due to the increasing British influence in India through the East India Company. He sent Ram Mohan Roy as an ambassador to Britain and gave him the title of Raja. During his regime, in 1835, the East India Company discontinued calling itself subject of the Mughal Emperor and issuing coins in his name. The Persian lines in the company&#x27;s coins to this effect were deleted.

Akbar II was credited with starting the Hindu–Muslim unity festival Phool Walon Ki Sair. His grave lies next to the dargah of 13th-century Sufi saint Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki at Mehrauli.

==Early life==
Prince Mirza Akbar was born on 22 April 1760 to Emperor Shah Alam II at Mukundpur, Satna, while his father was in exile. On 2 May 1781, at the Red Fort, the prince was made Crown prince with the title of &quot;Wali Ahd Bahadur&quot;, after the death of his elder brother. In 1782, he was appointed the viceroy of Delhi until 1799. When the Rohilla leader Ghulam Qadir captured Delhi in 1788, the young Prince Mirza Akbar was forced to nautch dance along with other Mughal princes. He witnessed how the members of the imperial Mughal family were humiliated, as well as starved. When Shah Jahan IV fled, Mirza Akbar was titular Emperor with the title of &quot;Akbar Shah II&quot;, and was to remain acting emperor even after the reinstatement of his father Shah Alam II, till January 1789.

==Reign==


Emperor Akbar II presided over an empire titularly large but in effect limited to the Red Fort in Delhi alone. The cultural life of Delhi as a whole flourished during his reign. However, his attitude towards East India Company officials, especially Lord Hastings, to whom he refused to grant an audience on terms other than those of subject and sovereign, although honourable to him, increasingly frustrated the British, who regarded him as merely their pensioner. The British therefore reduced his titular authority to &#x27;King of Delhi&#x27; in 1835 and the East India Company ceased to act as the mere lieutenants of the Mughal Empire as they did from 1803 to 1835. Simultaneously they replaced Persian text with English text on the company&#x27;s coins, which no longer carried the emperor&#x27;s name.

The British encouraged the Nawab of Oudh and the Nizam of Hyderabad to take royal titles to further diminish the Emperor&#x27;s status and influence. Out of deference, the Nizam did not, but the Nawab of Awadh did so.

He is also known to have bestowed the title &quot;Nawab&quot; upon the Nawab of Tonk and Nawab of Jaora.

Akbar II appointed the Bengali reformer Ram Mohan Roy, to appeal against his treatment by the East India Company, conferring on him the title of Raja. Ram Mohan Roy then visited England, as the Mughal envoy to the Court of St. James. Ram Mohan Roy submitted a well-argued memorial on behalf of the Mughal ruler, but to no avail.

The grave of Akbar II lies within a marble enclosure adjoined to the Moti Masjid near the dargah of the 13th century Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki at Mehrauli, Delhi. The Mughal emperors Bahadur Shah I, (Shah Alam I) and Shah Alam II are also buried here.

==Descendants==
After the mutiny, cousins of Mirza Mughal, son of Bahadur Shah Zafar, son of Akbar II, escaped to neighbouring areas in fear of capture by the British. Prince Mirza Mughal, the heir apparent was himself captured and executed by the British near Delhi gate. Many surviving princes settled in various provinces of India, but some settled in Burma, Bengal and Deccan since a large number of imperial family members, along with Emperor Bahadur Shah II were exiled to Rangoon in Burma.

<doc id="517238" wikidata="Q742772" url="?curid=517238" title="24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovich)">
<text>The 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87 by Dmitri Shostakovich are a set of 24 musical pieces for solo piano, one in each of the major and minor keys of the chromatic scale. The cycle was composed in 1950 and 1951 while Shostakovich was in Moscow, and premiered by pianist Tatiana Nikolayeva in Leningrad in December 1952; it was published the same year. A complete performance takes approximately 2 hours and 32 minutes. It is one of several examples of music written in all major and/or minor keys.

==Form and structure==

Each piece is in two parts—a prelude and fugue—varying in pace, length and complexity (for example, Fugue No. 13 in F major is in five voices, while Fugue No. 9 in E major is in only two voices).

The pieces proceed in relative major/minor pairs around the circle of fifths: first C major and A minor (prelude and fugue nos. 1 and 2), then to one sharp (G major, E minor), two sharps (D major, B minor), and so on, ending with D minor (1 flat). Chopin&#x27;s 24 Preludes, Op. 28, and Shostakovich&#x27;s own earlier 24 Preludes, Op. 34 are organized in the same way.

===Relationship to Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;===
J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, an earlier set of 48 preludes and fugues, are widely held to be the direct inspiration for Shostakovich&#x27;s cycle, largely based on the work&#x27;s composition history.

References to and quotations from Bach&#x27;s cycle appear throughout the work. For example, Shostakovich begins his C major prelude, the first piece in the cycle, with exactly the same notes that Bach uses in his own C major prelude, BWV 846, which likewise begins &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. Likewise, the composers&#x27; second fugues (A minor for Shostakovich, C minor for Bach) utilize very similar opening rhythms for their fugue subjects (two 16th notes followed by 3 eighth notes, twice in a row). In addition to more direct quotation, Shostakovich also at points imitates the various types of preludes found in the Bach cycle (and in other, similar, Baroque compositions). For example, his A minor prelude is a figuration prelude—a prelude in which the same hand position is used throughout the piece. Examples of this abound in Baroque keyboard literature from composers such as Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, from whom Bach drew inspiration for his own figuration preludes (the C major and the D minor, for example).

On a larger scale, the whole structure, ordered and sequenced as it is with no apparent extra-musical narrative, is largely a response to Bach. In Bach&#x27;s cycle, however, the pieces are arranged in parallel major/minor pairs ascending the chromatic scale (C major, C minor, C major, C minor etc.), which differs from Shostakovich&#x27;s Op. 87.

There are also several references and musical ideas taken from Shostakovich&#x27;s own work or anticipating future work.

==History==
After the Second World War, Dmitri Shostakovich was Russia&#x27;s most prominent composer. Although out of favour with the Soviet Communist Party, he was still sent abroad as a cultural ambassador. One such trip was to Leipzig in 1950 for a music festival marking the bicentennial of J. S. Bach&#x27;s death. As part of the festival, Shostakovich was asked to sit on the judging panel for the first International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition. One of the entrants in the competition was the 26-year-old Tatiana Nikolayeva from Moscow. Though not required by competition regulations, she had come prepared to play any of the 48 preludes and fugues of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; on request. She won the gold medal.

Inspired by the competition and impressed by Nikolayeva&#x27;s playing, Shostakovich returned to Moscow and started composing his own cycle of 24 preludes and fugues. Shostakovich worked fairly quickly, taking only three days on average to write each piece. As each was completed, he would ask Nikolayeva to come and visit him in his Moscow apartment where he would play her the latest piece. The complete work was written between 10 October 1950 and 25 February 1951. Once finished, Shostakovich dedicated the work to Nikolayeva, who undertook the public premiere in Leningrad on 23 December 1952. Shostakovich wrote out all the pieces without many corrections except the B minor prelude, with which he was dissatisfied and replaced what he had begun initially.

==Analysis==
==Reception==
Before premiering the work, Shostakovich privately performed the first half of the cycle before the Union of Composers (as was typical with new compositions during the Soviet Era) on 31 March 1951. The panel expressed great displeasure at the dissonance in some of the fugues, labelling the work as an example of formalism.

This work is considered by many (e.g. music critic Alex Ross, musicologist Tanya Ursova, etc.) to be produced by the &quot;other Shostakovich,&quot; or as a composition &quot;for the desk drawer.&quot; According to Ross, the composer used chamber forms in the period to channel his most personal compositions, those that would not be suitable for use or approval by the Soviet government. This work is included in that group along with several string quartets.

==Recordings==
Shostakovich recorded 18 of the 24 pieces at five recording sessions in 1951–1952, 1956 and 1958 (EMI). He never recorded Nos. 9, 10, 11, 15, 19 or 21 but he recorded Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 23 and 24 twice by doing the recording for EMI.

Tatiana Nikolayeva recorded complete sets four times, in 1962, 1987 (both originally issued by Melodiya), 1990 (Hyperion Records) and in 1992 as a filmed performance (Medici Arts). The 1962 and 1987 recordings have been reissued on several labels. She also recorded Nos. 1, 7 and 15 in 1952–1953.

Roger Woodward made the first complete recording available in the West in 1975; it was reissued on CD in September 2010 by Celestial Harmonies. Other notable complete recordings include those by Keith Jarrett, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Craig Sheppard, Konstantin Scherbakov, David Jalbert, Jenny Lin, Olli Mustonen, Peter Donohoe, Igor Levit and Hannes Minnaar.
Mustonen recorded the Shostakovich preludes and fugues in conjunction with those by Bach in sequences that contrast these works. His first recording was issued by RCA Victor Red Seal in 1996 and the second by Ondine Records in 2002. Levit&#x27;s recording, paired with Ronald Stevenson&#x27;s Passacaglia on DSCH, was issued by Sony in 2021.

<text>A heat pipe is a heat-transfer device that employs phase transition to transfer heat between two solid interfaces.

At the hot interface of a heat pipe, a volatile liquid in contact with a thermally conductive solid surface turns into a vapor by absorbing heat from that surface. The vapor then travels along the heat pipe to the cold interface and condenses back into a liquid, releasing the latent heat. The liquid then returns to the hot interface through capillary action, centrifugal force, or gravity and the cycle repeats.

Due to the very high heat transfer coefficients for boiling and condensation, heat pipes are highly effective thermal conductors. The effective thermal conductivity varies with heat pipe length and can approach for long heat pipes, in comparison with approximately for copper.

Modern CPU heat pipes are typically made of copper and use water as the working fluid. They are common in many consumer electronics like desktops, laptops, tablets, and high-end smartphones.

== History ==

The general principle of heat pipes using gravity, commonly classified as two phase thermosiphons, dates back to the steam age and Angier March Perkins and his son Loftus Perkins and the &quot;Perkins Tube&quot;, which saw widespread use in locomotive boilers and working ovens. Capillary-based heat pipes were first suggested by R. S. Gaugler of General Motors in 1942, who patented the idea, but did not develop it further.

George Grover independently developed capillary-based heat pipes at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1963, with his patent of that year being the first to use the term &quot;heat pipe&quot;, and he is often referred to as &quot;the inventor of the heat pipe&quot;. He noted in his notebook:

Grover&#x27;s suggestion was taken up by NASA, which played a large role in heat pipe development in the 1960s, particularly regarding applications and reliability in space flight. This was understandable given the low weight, high heat flux, and zero power draw of heat pipes – and that they would not be adversely affected by operating in a zero gravity environment.

The first application of heat pipes in the space program was the thermal equilibration of satellite transponders. As satellites orbit, one side is exposed to the direct radiation of the sun while the opposite side is completely dark and exposed to the deep cold of outer space. This causes severe discrepancies in the temperature (and thus reliability and accuracy) of the transponders. The heat pipe cooling system designed for this purpose managed the high heat fluxes and demonstrated flawless operation with and without the influence of gravity. The cooling system developed was the first use of variable conductance heat pipes to actively regulate heat flow or evaporator temperature. 

NASA has tested heat pipes designed for extreme conditions, with some using liquid sodium metal as the working fluid. Other forms of heat pipes are currently used to cool communication satellites. Publications in 1967 and 1968 by Feldman, Eastman, and Katzoff first discussed applications of heat pipes for wider uses such as in air conditioning, engine cooling, and electronics cooling. These papers were also the first to mention flexible, arterial, and flat plate heat pipes. Publications in 1969 introduced the concept of the rotational heat pipe with its applications to turbine blade cooling and contained the first discussions of heat pipe applications to cryogenic processes.

Starting in the 1980s Sony began incorporating heat pipes into the cooling schemes for some of its commercial electronic products in place of both forced convection and passive finned heat sinks. Initially they were used in receivers and amplifiers, soon spreading to other high heat flux electronics applications.

During the late 1990s increasingly high heat flux microcomputer CPUs spurred a threefold increase in the number of U.S. heat pipe patent applications. As heat pipes evolved from a specialized industrial heat transfer component to a consumer commodity most development and production moved from the U.S. to Asia.

Modern CPU heat pipes are typically made of copper and use water as the working fluid. They are common in many consumer electronics like desktops, laptops, tablets, and high-end smartphones.

== Structure, design and construction ==



A typical heat pipe consists of a sealed pipe or tube made of a material that is compatible with the working fluid such as copper for water heat pipes, or aluminium for ammonia heat pipes. Typically, a vacuum pump is used to remove the air from the empty heat pipe. The heat pipe is partially filled with a &quot;working fluid&quot; and then sealed. The working fluid mass is chosen so that the heat pipe contains both vapor and liquid over the operating temperature range.

The stated/recommended operating temperature of a given heat pipe system is critically important. Below the operating temperature, the liquid is too cold and cannot vaporize into a gas. Above the operating temperature, all the liquid has turned to gas, and the environmental temperature is too high for any of the gas to condense. Thermal conduction is still possible through the walls of the heat pipe, but at a greatly reduced rate of thermal transfer. In addition, for a given heat input, it is necessary that a minimum temperature of the working fluid be attained; while at the other end, any additional increase (deviation) in the heat transfer coefficient from the initial design will tend to inhibit the heat pipe action. This can be counterintuitive, in the sense that if a heat pipe system is aided by a fan, then the heat pipe operation may break down, resulting in a reduced effectiveness of the thermal management system—potentially severely reduced. The operating temperature and the maximum heat transport capacity of a heat pipe—limited by its capillary or other structure used to return the fluid to the hot area (centrifugal force, gravity, etc.)—are therefore inescapably and closely related.

Working fluids are chosen according to the temperatures at which the heat pipe must operate, with examples ranging from liquid helium for extremely low temperature applications (2–4 K) to mercury (523–923 K), sodium (873–1473 K) and even indium (2000–3000 K) for extremely high temperatures. The vast majority of heat pipes for room temperature applications use ammonia (213–373 K), alcohol (methanol (283–403 K) or ethanol (273–403 K)), or water (298–573 K) as the working fluid. Copper/water heat pipes have a copper envelope, use water as the working fluid and typically operate in the temperature range of . Water heat pipes are sometimes filled by partially filling with water, heating until the water boils and displaces the air, and then sealed while hot.

For the heat pipe to transfer heat, it must contain saturated liquid and its vapor (gas phase). The saturated liquid vaporizes and travels to the condenser, where it is cooled and turned back to a saturated liquid. In a standard heat pipe, the condensed liquid is returned to the evaporator using a wick structure exerting a capillary action on the liquid phase of the working fluid. Wick structures used in heat pipes include sintered metal powder, screen, and grooved wicks, which have a series of grooves parallel to the pipe axis. When the condenser is located above the evaporator in a gravitational field, gravity can return the liquid. In this case, the heat pipe is a thermosiphon. Finally, rotating heat pipes use centrifugal forces to return liquid from the condenser to the evaporator.

Heat pipes contain no mechanical moving parts and typically require no maintenance, though non-condensable gases that diffuse through the pipe&#x27;s walls, that result from breakdown of the working fluid, or that exist as original impurities in the material, may eventually reduce the pipe&#x27;s effectiveness at transferring heat.

The advantage of heat pipes over many other heat-dissipation mechanisms is their great efficiency in transferring heat. A pipe one inch in diameter and two feet long can transfer at with only drop from end to end. Some heat pipes have demonstrated a heat flux of more than 23 kW/cm2, about four times the heat flux through the surface of the Sun.

Heat pipes have an envelope, a wick, and a working fluid. Heat pipes are designed for very long term operation with no maintenance, so the heat pipe wall and wick must be compatible with the working fluid. Some material/working fluids pairs that appear to be compatible are not. For example, water in an aluminum envelope will develop significant amounts of non-condensable gas within hours or days, hindering normal heat pipe operation. This issue is primarily due to the oxidation and corrosion of aluminum in the presence of water, which releases hydrogen gas that accumulates as a non-condensable gas.

Since heat pipes were rediscovered by George Grover in 1963, extensive life tests have been conducted to determine compatible envelope/fluid pairs, some going on for decades. In a heat pipe life test, heat pipes are operated for long periods of time, and monitored for problems such as non-condensable gas generation, material transport, and corrosion.

The most commonly used envelope (and wick)/fluid pairs include:

* Copper envelope with water working fluid for electronics cooling. This is by far the most common type of heat pipe.
* Copper or steel envelope with refrigerant R134a working fluid for energy recovery in HVAC systems.
* Aluminium envelope with ammonia working fluid for spacecraft thermal control.
* Superalloy envelope with alkali metal (cesium, potassium, sodium) working fluid for high temperature heat pipes, most commonly used for calibrating primary temperature measurement devices.

Other pairs include stainless steel envelopes with nitrogen, oxygen, neon, hydrogen, or helium working fluids at temperatures below 100 K, copper/methanol heat pipes for electronics cooling when the heat pipe must operate below the water range, aluminium/ethane heat pipes for spacecraft thermal control in environments when ammonia can freeze, and refractory metal envelope/lithium working fluid for high temperature (above ) applications.

Heat pipes must be tuned to particular cooling conditions. The choice of pipe material, size, and coolant all have an effect on the optimal temperatures at which heat pipes work. When used outside of its design heat range, the heat pipe&#x27;s thermal conductivity is effectively reduced to the heat conduction properties of its solid metal casing alone. In the case of a copper casing, that is around 1/80 of the original flux. This is because outside the intended temperature range the working fluid will not undergo phase change; below the range, the working fluid never vaporizes, and above the range it never condenses.

Most manufacturers cannot make a traditional heat pipe smaller than 3 mm in diameter due to material limitations. Heat pipes containing graphene have been demonstrated which can improve cooling performance in electronics.

== Types ==

In addition to standard, constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs), there are a number of other types of heat pipes, including:

* Vapor chambers (planar heat pipes), which are used for heat flux transformation, and isothermalization of surfaces
* Variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs), which use a non-condensable gas (NCG) to change the heat pipe effective thermal conductivity as power or the heat sink conditions change
* Pressure controlled heat pipes (PCHPs), which are a VCHP where the volume of the reservoir, or the NCG mass can be changed, to give more precise temperature control
* Diode heat pipes, which have a high thermal conductivity in the forward direction, and a low thermal conductivity in the reverse direction
* Thermosyphons, which are heat pipes where the liquid is returned to the evaporator by gravitational/accelerational forces,
* Rotating heat pipes, where the liquid is returned to the evaporator by centrifugal forces

=== Vapor chamber ===

Thin planar heat pipes (heat spreaders or flat heat pipes) have the same primary components as tubular heat pipes: a hermetically sealed hollow vessel, a working fluid, and a closed-loop capillary recirculation system. In addition, an internal support structure or a series of posts are generally used in a vapor chamber to accommodate clamping pressures sometimes up to . This helps prevent collapse of the flat top and bottom when the pressure is applied.

There are two main applications for vapor chambers. First, they are used when high powers and heat fluxes are applied to a relatively small evaporator. Heat input to the evaporator vaporizes liquid, which flows in two dimensions to the condenser surfaces. After the vapor condenses on the condenser surfaces, capillary forces in the wick return the condensate to the evaporator. Note that most vapor chambers are insensitive to gravity, and will still operate when inverted, with the evaporator above the condenser. In this application, the vapor chamber acts as a heat flux transformer, cooling a high heat flux from an electronic chip or laser diode, and transforming it to a lower heat flux that can be removed by natural or forced convection. With special evaporator wicks, vapor chambers can remove 2000 W over 4 cm2, or 700 W over 1 cm2.

Another major usage of vapor chambers is for cooling purposes in gaming laptops. As vapor chambers are a flatter and more two-dimensional method of heat dissipation, sleeker gaming laptops benefit hugely from them as compared to traditional heat pipes. For example, the vapor chamber cooling in Lenovo&#x27;s Legion 7i was its most unique selling point (although it was misadvertised as all models having vapor chambers, while in fact only a few had).

Second, compared to a one-dimensional tubular heat pipe, the width of a two-dimensional heat pipe allows an adequate cross section for heat flow even with a very thin device. These thin planar heat pipes are finding their way into &quot;height sensitive&quot; applications, such as notebook computers and surface mount circuit board cores. It is possible to produce flat heat pipes as thin as 1.0 mm (slightly thicker than a 0.76 mm credit card).

=== Variable conductance ===

Standard heat pipes are constant conductance devices, where the heat pipe operating temperature is set by the source and sink temperatures, the thermal resistances from the source to the heat pipe, and the thermal resistances from the heat pipe to the sink. In these heat pipes, the temperature drops linearly as the power or condenser temperature is reduced. For some applications, such as satellite or research balloon thermal control, the electronics will be overcooled at low powers, or at the low sink temperatures. Variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs) are used to passively maintain the temperature of the electronics being cooled as power and sink conditions change.

Variable conductance heat pipes have two additions compared to a standard heat pipe: 1. a reservoir, and 2. a non-condensable gas (NCG) added to the heat pipe, in addition to the working fluid. This non-condensable gas is typically argon for standard Variable conductance heat pipes, and helium for thermosyphons. When the heat pipe is not operating, the non-condensable gas and working fluid vapor are mixed throughout the heat pipe vapor space. When the variable conductance heat pipe is operating, the non-condensable gas is swept toward the condenser end of the heat pipe by the flow of the working fluid vapor. Most of the non-condensable gas is located in the reservoir, while the remainder blocks a portion of the heat pipe condenser. The variable conductance heat pipe works by varying the active length of the condenser. When the power or heat sink temperature is increased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure increase. The increased vapor pressure forces more of the non-condensable gas into the reservoir, increasing the active condenser length and the heat pipe conductance. Conversely, when the power or heat sink temperature is decreased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure decrease, and the non-condensable gas expands, reducing the active condenser length and heat pipe conductance. The addition of a small heater on the reservoir, with the power controlled by the evaporator temperature, will allow thermal control of roughly ±1-2 °C. In one example, the evaporator temperature was maintained in a ±1.65 °C control band, as power was varied from 72 to 150 W, and heat sink temperature varied from +15 °C to −65 °C.

Pressure controlled heat pipes (PCHPs) can be used when tighter temperature control is required. In a pressure controlled heat pipe, the evaporator temperature is used to either vary the reservoir volume, or the amount of non-condensable gas in the heat pipe. Pressure controlled heat pipes have shown milli-Kelvin temperature control.

=== Diode ===

Conventional heat pipes transfer heat in either direction, from the hotter to the colder end of the heat pipe. Several different heat pipes act as a thermal diode, transferring heat in one direction, while acting as an insulator in the other:

* Thermosyphons, which only transfer heat from the bottom to the top of the thermosyphon, where the condensate returns by gravity. When the thermosyphon is heated at the top, there is no liquid available to evaporate.
* Rotating heat pipes, where the heat pipe is shaped so that liquid can only travel by centrifugal forces from the nominal evaporator to the nominal condenser. Again, no liquid is available when the nominal condenser is heated.
* Vapor trap diode heat pipes.
* Liquid trap diode heat pipes.
A vapor trap diode is fabricated in a similar fashion to a variable conductance heat pipe, with a gas reservoir at the end of the condenser. During fabrication, the heat pipe is charged with the working fluid and a controlled amount of a non-condensable gas (NCG). During normal operation, the flow of the working fluid vapor from the evaporator to the condenser sweeps the non-condensable gas into the reservoir, where it does not interfere with the normal heat pipe operation. When the nominal condenser is heated, the vapor flow is from the nominal condenser to the nominal evaporator. The non-condensable gas is dragged along with the flowing vapor, completely blocking the nominal evaporator, and greatly increasing the thermal resistivity of the heat pipe. In general, there is some heat transfer to the nominal adiabatic section. Heat is then conducted through the heat pipe walls to the evaporator. In one example, a vapor trap diode carried 95 W in the forward direction, and only 4.3 W in the reverse direction.
A liquid trap diode has a wicked reservoir at the evaporator end of the heat pipe, with a separate wick that is not in communication with the wick in the remainder of the heat pipe. During normal operation, the evaporator and reservoir are heated. The vapor flows to the condenser, and liquid returns to the evaporator by capillary forces in the wick. The reservoir eventually dries out, since there is no method for returning liquid. When the nominal condenser is heated, liquid condenses in the evaporator and the reservoir. While the liquid can return to the nominal condenser from the nominal evaporator, the liquid in the reservoir is trapped, since the reservoir wick is not connected. Eventually, all of the liquid is trapped in the reservoir, and the heat pipe ceases operation.

=== Thermosyphons ===

Most heat pipes use a wick to return the liquid from the condenser to the evaporator, allowing the heat pipe to operate in any orientation. The liquid is sucked up back to the evaporator by capillary action, similar to the way that a sponge sucks up water when an edge is placed in contact with a pool of water. However the maximum adverse elevation (evaporator over condenser) is relatively small, on the order of 25 cm long for a typical water heat pipe.

If, however, the evaporator is located below the condenser, the liquid can drain back by gravity instead of requiring a wick, and the distance between the two can be much longer. Such a gravity-aided heat pipe is known as a thermosyphon.

In a thermosyphon, liquid working fluid is vaporized by a heat supplied to the evaporator at the bottom of the heat pipe. The vapor travels to the condenser at the top of the heat pipe, where it condenses. The liquid then drains back to the bottom of the heat pipe by gravity, and the cycle repeats. Thermosyphons are diode heat pipes; when heat is applied to the condenser end, there is no condensate available, and hence no way to form vapor and transfer heat to the evaporator.

While a typical terrestrial water heat pipe is less than 30 cm long, thermosyphons are often several meters long. The thermosyphons used to cool the Alaska pipe line were roughly 11 to 12 m long. Even longer thermosyphons have been proposed for the extraction of geothermal energy. For example, Storch et al. fabricated a 53 mm I.D., 92 m long propane thermosyphon that carried roughly 6 kW of heat. Their scalability to large sizes also makes them relevant for solar thermal and HVAC applications.

=== Loop ===

A loop heat pipe (LHP) is a passive two-phase transfer device related to the heat pipe. It can carry higher power over longer distances by having co-current liquid and vapor flow, in contrast to the counter-current flow in a heat pipe. This allows the wick in a loop heat pipe to be required only in the evaporator and compensation chamber. Micro loop heat pipes have been developed and successfully employed in a wide sphere of applications both on the ground and in space.

=== Oscillating or pulsating ===

An oscillating heat pipe (OHP), also known as a pulsating heat pipe (PHP), is only partially filled with liquid working fluid. The pipe is arranged in a serpentine pattern in which freely moving liquid and vapor segments alternate. Oscillation takes place in the working fluid; the pipe remains motionless. These have been investigated for many applications, including cooling photovoltaic panels, cooling electronic devices, heat recovery systems, fuel cell systems, HVAC systems, and desalination. More and more, PHPs are synergistically combined with phase change materials.

==Heat transfer==
Heat pipes employ phase change to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the vaporization and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. Heat pipes rely on a temperature difference between the ends of the pipe, and cannot lower temperatures at either end below the ambient temperature (hence they tend to equalize the temperature within the pipe).

When one end of the heat pipe is heated, the working fluid inside the pipe at that end vaporizes and increases the vapor pressure inside the cavity of the heat pipe. The latent heat of vaporization absorbed by the working fluid reduces the temperature at the hot end of the pipe.

The vapor pressure over the hot liquid working fluid at the hot end of the pipe is higher than the equilibrium vapor pressure over the condensing working fluid at the cooler end of the pipe, and this pressure difference drives a rapid mass transfer to the condensing end where the excess vapor condenses, releases its latent heat, and warms the cool end of the pipe. Non-condensing gases (caused by contamination for instance) in the vapor impede the gas flow and reduce the effectiveness of the heat pipe, particularly at low temperatures, where vapor pressures are low. The speed of molecules in a gas is approximately the speed of sound, and in the absence of noncondensing gases (i.e., if there is only a gas phase present) this is the upper limit to the velocity with which they could travel in the heat pipe. In practice, the speed of the vapor through the heat pipe is limited by the rate of condensation at the cold end and far lower than the molecular speed. Note/explanation: The condensation rate is very close to the sticking coefficient times the molecular speed times the gas density, if the condensing surface is very cold. However, if the surface is close to the temperature of the gas, the evaporation caused by the finite temperature of the surface largely cancels this heat flux. If the temperature difference is more than some tens of degrees, the vaporization from the surface is typically negligible, as can be assessed from the vapor pressure curves. In most cases, with very efficient heat transport through the gas, it is very challenging to maintain such significant temperature differences between the gas and the condensing surface. Moreover, this temperature differences of course corresponds to a large effective thermal resistance by itself. The bottleneck is often less severe at the heat source, as the gas densities are higher there, corresponding to higher maximum heat fluxes.

The condensed working fluid then flows back to the hot end of the pipe. In the case of vertically oriented heat pipes the fluid may be moved by the force of gravity. In the case of heat pipes containing wicks, the fluid is returned by capillary action.

When making heat pipes, there is no need to create a vacuum in the pipe. One simply boils the working fluid in the heat pipe until the resulting vapor has purged the non-condensing gases from the pipe, and then seals the end.

An interesting property of heat pipes is the temperature range over which they are effective. Initially, it might be suspected that a water-charged heat pipe only works when the hot end reaches the boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F, at normal atmospheric pressure) and steam is transferred to the cold end. However, the boiling point of water depends on the absolute pressure inside the pipe. In an evacuated pipe, water vaporizes from its triple point (0.01 °C, 32 °F) to its critical point (374 °C; 705 °F), as long as the heat pipe contains both liquid and vapor. Thus a heat pipe can operate at hot-end temperatures as low as just slightly warmer than the melting point of the working fluid, although the maximum rate of heat transfer is low at temperatures below 25 °C (77 °F). Similarly, a heat pipe with water as a working fluid can work well above the atmospheric boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). The maximum temperature for long term water heat pipes is 270 °C (518 °F), with heat pipes operating up to 300 °C (572 °F) for short term tests.

The main reason for the effectiveness of heat pipes is the vaporization and condensation of the working fluid. The heat of vaporization greatly exceeds the specific heat capacity. Using water as an example, the energy needed to evaporate one gram of water is 540 times the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of that same one gram of water by 1 °C. Almost all of that energy is rapidly transferred to the &quot;cold&quot; end when the fluid condenses there, making a very effective heat transfer system with no moving parts.

==Applications==

===Spacecraft===

The spacecraft thermal control system has the function to keep all components on the spacecraft within their acceptable temperature range. This is complicated by the following:

* Widely varying external conditions, such as eclipses
* Micro-g environment
* Heat removal from the spacecraft by thermal radiation only
* Limited electrical power available, favoring passive solutions
* Long lifetimes, with no possibility of maintenance

Some spacecraft are designed to last for 20 years, so heat transport without electrical power or moving parts is desirable. Rejecting the heat by thermal radiation means that large radiator panes (multiple square meters) are required. Heat pipes and loop heat pipes are used extensively in spacecraft, since they don&#x27;t require any power to operate, operate nearly isothermally, and can transport heat over long distances.

Grooved wicks are used in spacecraft heat pipes, as shown in the first photograph in this section. The heat pipes are formed by extruding aluminium, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop. Grooved wicks are used in spacecraft, instead of the screen or sintered wicks used for terrestrial heat pipes, since the heat pipes don&#x27;t have to operate against gravity in space. This allows spacecraft heat pipes to be several meters long, in contrast to the roughly 25 cm maximum length for a water heat pipe operating on Earth. Ammonia is the most common working fluid for spacecraft heat pipes. Ethane is used when the heat pipe must operate at temperatures below the ammonia freezing temperature.

The second figure shows a typical grooved aluminium/ammonia variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) for spacecraft thermal control. The heat pipe is an aluminium extrusion, similar to that shown in the first figure. The bottom flanged area is the evaporator. Above the evaporator, the flange is machined off to allow the adiabatic section to be bent. The condenser is shown above the adiabatic section. The non-condensable gas (NCG) reservoir is located above the main heat pipe. The valve is removed after filling and sealing the heat pipe. When electric heaters are used on the reservoir, the evaporator temperature can be controlled within ±2 K of the setpoint.

===Computer systems===

Heat pipes began to be used in computer systems in the late 1990s, when increased power requirements and subsequent increases in heat emission resulted in greater demands on cooling systems. They are now extensively used in many modern computer systems, typically to move heat away from components such as CPUs and GPUs to heat sinks where thermal energy may be dissipated into the environment.

===Solar thermal===
Heat pipes are also widely used in solar thermal water heating applications in combination with evacuated tube solar collector arrays. In these applications, distilled water is commonly used as the heat transfer fluid inside a sealed length of copper tubing that is located within an evacuated glass tube and oriented towards the Sun. In connecting pipes, the heat transport occurs in the liquid steam phase because the thermal transfer medium is converted into steam in a large section of the collecting pipeline.

In solar thermal water heating applications, an individual absorber tube of an evacuated tube collector is up to 40% more efficient compared to more traditional &quot;flat plate&quot; solar water collectors. This is largely due to the vacuum that exists within the tube, which slows down convective and conductive heat loss. Relative efficiencies of the evacuated tube system are reduced however, when compared to flat plate collectors because the latter have a larger aperture size and can absorb more solar energy per unit area. This means that while an individual evacuated tube has better insulation (lower conductive and convective losses) due to the vacuum created inside the tube, an array of tubes found in a completed solar assembly absorbs less energy per unit area due to there being less absorber surface area pointed toward the Sun because of the rounded design of an evacuated tube collector. Therefore, real world efficiencies of both designs are about the same.

Evacuated tube collectors reduce the need for anti-freeze additives since the vacuum helps slow heat loss. However, under prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures the heat transfer fluid can still freeze and precautions must be taken to ensure that the freezing liquid does not damage the evacuated tube when designing systems for such environments. Properly designed solar thermal water heaters can be frost protected down to more than -3 °C with special additives and are being used in Antarctica to heat water.

===Permafrost cooling===

Building on permafrost is difficult because heat from the structure can thaw the permafrost. Heat pipes are used in some cases to avoid the risk of destabilization. For example, in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System residual ground heat remaining in the oil as well as heat produced by friction and turbulence in the moving oil could conduct down the pipe&#x27;s support legs and melt the permafrost on which the supports are anchored. This would cause the pipeline to sink and possibly be damaged. To prevent this, each vertical support member has been mounted with four vertical heat pipe thermosyphons.

The significant feature of a thermosyphon is that it is passive and does not require any external power to operate. During the winter, the air is colder than the ground around the supports. The liquid at the bottom of the thermosyphon is vaporized by heat absorbed from the ground, cooling the surrounding permafrost and lowering its temperature. During the summer, the thermosyphons stop operating, since there is no gas condensing at the top of the heat pipe, but the extreme air cooling during the winter causes condensation and the liquid to flow down. In the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System initially ammonia was used as the working fluid, however this was replaced with carbon dioxide due to blockages.

Heat pipes are also used to keep the permafrost frozen alongside parts of the Qinghai–Tibet Railway where the embankment and track absorb the sun&#x27;s heat. Vertical heat pipes on either side of relevant formations prevent that heat from spreading any further into the surrounding permafrost.

Depending on application there are several thermosyphon designs: thermoprobe, thermopile, depth thermosyphon, sloped-thermosyphon foundation, flat loop thermosyphon foundation, and hybrid flat loop thermosyphon foundation.

===Cooking===
The first commercial heat pipe product was the &quot;Thermal Magic Cooking Pin&quot; developed by Energy Conversion Systems, Inc. and first sold in 1966. The cooking pins used water as the working fluid. The envelope was stainless steel, with an inner copper layer for compatibility. During operation, one end of the heat pipe is poked through the roast. The other end extends into the oven where it draws heat to the middle of the roast. The high effective conductivity of the heat pipe reduces the cooking time for large pieces of meat by one-half.

The principle has also been applied to camping stoves. The heat pipe transfers a large volume of heat at low temperature to allow goods to be baked and other dishes to be cooked in camping-type situations.

===Ventilation heat recovery===
In heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat pipes are positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air-handling system or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, in order to recover the heat energy.

The device consists of a battery of multi-row finned heat pipe tubes located within both the supply and exhaust air streams. The system recovers heat from the exhaust and transfers it to the intake.

Because of the characteristics of the device, better efficiencies are obtained when the unit is positioned upright with the supply-air side mounted over the exhaust air side, which allows the liquid refrigerant to flow quickly back to the evaporator aided by the force of gravity. Generally, gross heat transfer efficiencies of up to 75% are claimed by manufacturers.

===Nuclear power conversion===
Grover and his colleagues were working on cooling systems for nuclear power cells for space craft, where extreme thermal conditions are encountered. These alkali metal heat pipes transferred heat from the heat source to a thermionic or thermoelectric converter to generate electricity.

Since the early 1990s, numerous nuclear reactor power systems have been proposed using heat pipes for transporting heat between the reactor core and the power conversion system. The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity using heat pipes was first operated on September 13, 2012, in a demonstration using flattop fission.

===Wankel rotary combustion engines===
Ignition of the fuel mixture always takes place in the same part of Wankel engines, inducing thermal dilatation disparities that reduce power output, impair fuel economy, and accelerate wear. In the SAE paper , by Wei Wu et al., describes: &#x27;A Heat Pipe Assisted Air-Cooled Rotary Wankel Engine for Improved Durability, Power and Efficiency&#x27;, they obtained a reduction in top engine temperature from 231 °C to 129 °C, and the temperature difference reduced from 159 °C to 18 °C for a typical small-chamber-displacement air-cooled unmanned aerial vehicle engine.

=== Heat pipe heat exchangers ===
Heat exchangers transfer heat from a hot stream to a cold stream of air, water or oil. A heat pipe heat exchanger contains several heat pipes of which each acts as an individual heat exchanger itself. This increases efficiency, life span and safety. In case that one heat pipe breaks, only a small amount of liquid is released which is critical for certain industrial processes such as aluminium casting. Additionally, with one broken heat pipe the heat pipe heat exchanger still remains operable.

Under the direction of Professor Hussam Jouhara of Brunel University London, the EU-funded ETEKINA project used a new model of heat pipe heat exchanger to recover over 40% of waste heat from various industrial factories across Europe between 2017 and 2022.

=== Currently developed applications ===
Due to the great adaptability of heat pipes, research explores the implementation of heat pipes into various systems:

* Improving the efficiency of geothermal heating to prevent slippery roads during winter in cold climate zones 
* Increased efficiency of photovoltaic cells by coupling the solar panel to a heat pipe system. This transports heat away from overheated panels to maintain optimal temperature for maximum energy generation. Additionally, the tested set up seizes the recovered thermal heat to warm, for instance, water 
* Hybrid control rod heat pipes to shut down a nuclear reactor in case of an emergency and simultaneously transferring decay heat away to prevent the reactor from running hot

<text>The European long-distance paths (E-paths) are a network of long-distance footpaths that traverse Europe. While most long-distance footpaths in Europe are located in just one country or region, each of these numbered European long-distance paths passes through many countries.

The first long-distance hiking trail in Europe was the National Blue Trail of Hungary, established in 1938. The formation of the European Union made transnational hiking trails possible. Today, the network consists of 12 paths and covers more than , crisscrossing Europe. In general, the routes connect and make use of existing national and local trails such as the GR footpaths.

The paths are officially designated by the European Ramblers&#x27; Association.

<doc id="517255" wikidata="Q615977" url="?curid=517255" title="Aviadvigatel PS-90">
<text>The Aviadvigatel PS-90 is a Russian high-bypass commercial turbofan rated at 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust. It powers Russian airliners such as the Ilyushin Il-96 and the Tupolev Tu-204/Tu-214 series and transport aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-76. It is made by the Russian aircraft engine company Aviadvigatel, which is the successor of the Soviet Soloviev Design Bureau. &quot;PS&quot; are the initials of Pavel Soloviev ().

==Design and development==
With the advent of new generation of Soviet airliners, Aviadvigatel developed the PS-90 to satisfy the demands of economy, performance and exhaust emissions. It represented a huge advance over previous generations of 1960s era Soviet engines. The PS-90 is almost double the efficiency of those engines and is reasonably competitive to western engines of the 1980s such as the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000.

===Design features===

It incorporates many firsts in a one-of-a-kind Russian engine with advanced technology features such as
*High-bypass turbofan design for economy
*Integrated exhaust with exhaust mixer for good efficiency
*Acoustically treated exhaust duct for low noise
*Full-authority digital engine control (FADEC)
*Long service life based on on-condition maintenance
*Modular design for ease of maintenance

It was first certified in 1992 and has been in service since.

==Variants==
There are several variants: the basic PS-90A, the PS-90A-76, and the improved PS-90A versions. The latter include the PS-90A1, PS-90A2, PS-90A-42 and the PS-90A3 engines.

===PS-90A===

The PS-90A engine is the initial variant and is standard equipment for Ilyushin Il-96-300, Tupolev Tu-204-100 and Tupolev Tu-214. For the first time, it allowed Russian airliners to achieve similar performance and economy to their western counterparts. PS-90A is rated nominally at 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust, 13.3% less than the Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engine (which is also offered on the Tu-204), and the fuel consumption is 8.2% less than it.

===PS-90A-76===

This variant is a modification of the basic PS-90A engine. It is rated nominally up to 14,500 kgf (142 kN, 32,000 lbf) take-off thrust.

By replacing the D-30KP on the older Il-76, the service life of the aircraft can be extended. Fuel efficiency, and performance will be markedly improved and noise pollution reduced to comply with the new strict requirements. With the large fleet of both civil and military Il-76 aircraft still in operation, a potentially large market exists for engine replacement. An example of such a modified version is the Il-76MD-90. The PS-90A-76 is the standard on the newly built, modernized versions of the Il-76, such as the Il-76MD-90A and the Il-76MF.

===PS-90A1===
This variant is also a modification of the basic PS-90A engine. It was certified in 2007 and is offered as an option on the IL-96-400T aircraft.

===PS-90A2===
The PS-90A2 is an advanced derivative of the PS-90A, developed in cooperation with Pratt &amp; Whitney. It has a fair proportion of western components from France, Germany, Sweden and the USA. It is also lighter than PS-90A and features improved FADEC. These features improve the performance and reduce maintenance costs by 40%. Fuel consumption is on par with current western engines, and its noise levels are below the current regulatory requirements. The PS-90A2 is the first Russian engine to be ETOPS-180 min rated. It is offered in newly built aircraft and is completely interchangeable with the PS-90A, allowing simple upgrades on present airliners.

It has the same thrust rating as the PS-90A, 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust. It is also capable of 18000 kgf (176 kN, 39,600 lbf) thrust.

Future American involvement in engine development has been put in doubt after attempts to block sale of PS-90A2 engines to an Iranian customer.

===PS-90A-42===
This is a version of the PS-90A2 intended for the Beriev A-42 search and rescue aircraft.

===PS-90A3===
According to the manufacturer, it is a modification of the PS-90A2. It was certified in January 2011 and intended to power the Tupolev Tu-204SM aircraft. It is unclear whether the US and European components of the PS-90A2 remain or whether they have been replaced by Russian ones. If the US components have indeed been replaced, then this engine could be fitted to the Tu-204SM ordered by Iran Air and its subsidiaries.

<doc id="517256" wikidata="Q94765" url="?curid=517256" title="James Wilson (businessman)">
<text>James Wilson (3 June 1805 – 11 August 1860) was a Scottish businessman, economist, and Liberal politician who founded &quot;The Economist&quot; weekly and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, which merged with Standard Bank in 1969 to form Standard Chartered. He was the first Finance Member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council from December 1859 until his death in August 1860. Sent there to put order into the chaos that followed the &quot;Sepoy Mutiny&quot; of 1857, he presented India&#x27;s first budget, and was responsible for the government accounting system, Pay Office, and audit, apart from government paper currency, Indian Police, a Military Finance Commission, and a Civil Finance Commission.

== Early life ==
Wilson was born in Hawick in the Scottish Borders. His Quaker father William Wilson owned a hat manufactury, and his ancestors were local sheep farmers. He was the fourth of fifteen children, of whom ten reached adulthood. His mother died when James was young.

A successful disciplined autodidact scholar from a Quaker family, he was destined to be a schoolmaster but hated it so much that he &quot;would rather to be the most menial servant in [his] father&#x27;s mill&quot;. After considering studying law with a view to becoming an advocate, a profession which would have meant abandoning his family religion, Wilson decided instead to learn business, and at the age of sixteen became an apprentice in a hat factory. Later, his father bought the business for him and his elder brother, William. When James Wilson was nineteen, the brothers left Scotland and migrated to London, with a gift of £2,000 each, .

== Career ==

=== Business ===
The brothers established a manufacturing factory—Wilson, Irwin &amp; Wilson—that they dissolved in 1831. Wilson continued in the same line of business with much success (his net worth was £25,000 in 1837, . During the economic crisis of 1837, he lost most of his wealth when the price of indigo fell. By 1839, he had sold most of his property and avoided bankruptcy. However, in 1853 he founded the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, which later merged with the Standard Bank to form Standard Chartered Bank in 1969.

=== Journalism ===
Wilson was generally opposed to privileging the Church of England, the secret ballot when it was proposed in 1853, and the Corn Laws. He wrote a pamphlet titled &quot;Influences of the Corn Laws, as affecting all classes of the community, and particularly the landed interests&quot;. It slowly received positive feedback and Wilson&#x27;s fame had grown. He then went on writing on currency, and especially &quot;The Revenue; or, What should the Chancellor do?&quot;. He started to write for newspapers, including the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. In 1843 he established &quot;The Economist&quot; as a newspaper to campaign for free trade, and acted as Chief editor and sole proprietor for sixteen years. His overarching goal to end vested interests in the Westminster parliament wherever these led to poverty or starvation, as the Corn Laws most notably had done. An article Wilson published in April 1848 in opposition to the Ten Hours Bill was criticised by Karl Marx for misunderstanding profit and the working day. &quot;The Economist&quot; is still published today, now with a weekly circulation of over 1.6 million globally. Wilson was the most respected statistician of his times and saw economics as an optimistic and rational way of mediating socially sustainable futures drawing on the Scottish School of Adam Smith and the French &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; School of Jean-Baptiste Say.

=== Politics ===
Wilson entered the House of Commons as Liberal Member of Parliament for Westbury, Wiltshire, in 1847. Due to his economic experience, in 1848, prime minister Lord John Russell appointed Wilson as Secretary of the Board of Control, which supervised the East India Company&#x27;s control of British India, a post he held until the government fell in 1852. He then served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury between 1853 and 1858, firstly in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition government and secondly in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s first administration. In 1857, he was returned to Parliament for Devonport. He again briefly held office under Palmerston as Paymaster General and Vice-President of the Board of Trade between June and August 1859, and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year.

In August 1859, Wilson resigned these offices and his seat in parliament to sit as the financial member of the Council of India. He was sent by Queen Victoria to India to establish the tax structure, a new paper currency, and remodel India&#x27;s finance system after the Rebellion of 1857. However, he was in office only a year before he died. In 1860, he refused to leave the stifling summer heat of Calcutta, contracted dysentery, and died in August of that year at age 55.

Despite his prominent public role, Wilson was buried unknown at a cemetery at Mullick Bazar in Kolkata. His grave was discovered in 2007 by CP Bhatia, a joint commissioner of Income Tax, while researching a book on India&#x27;s tax history. Due to the efforts of CP Bhatia the tombstone was restored by the Christian Burial Board.

== Family ==
Wilson married Elizabeth Preston of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in January 1832. They had six daughters, of whom Eliza, the eldest, married Walter Bagehot.

<doc id="517282" wikidata="Q1100969" url="?curid=517282" title="Talgo">
<text>Talgo (officially Patentes Talgo, SAU) is a Spanish manufacturer of intercity, standard, and high-speed passenger trains. Talgo is an abbreviation of &quot;Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol&quot; (English: &quot;Lightweight articulated train Goicoechea Oriol&quot;).

The company was founded by Alejandro Goicoechea and José Luis Oriol. It was first incorporated in 1942.

==Corporate history==
The creation of Talgo can be largely credited to the work of Alejandro Goicoechea and José Luis Oriol. During the 1930s, Goicoechea, a pioneering railway engineer, sought to produce a new generation of rolling stock that would be primarily composed of metal, rather than wood; to reduce operational cost, he also emphasised lightweight yet sturdy construction, while a low center of gravity would deter derailing and thus permit higher operating speeds. In 1942, financial backing for the construction of a prototype train was provided by Oriol, which believed in Goicoechea&#x27;s concepts. The two produced the agreement that established &quot;Patentes Talgo&quot; as a company that same year. The prototype train would emerge as the &quot;Talgo I&quot;.

During the late 1940s, Talgo came to recognise that Spain, and the wider European continent, were in a poor economic condition following the Second World War and so were unlikely to be customers for new rolling stock from an unproven manufacturer. Furthermore, the company was keen to acquire advanced technical knowledge and designs, so a favourable agreement was struck with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to collaborate on the manufacture of the &quot;Talgo II&quot; in the United States. The first vehicles arrived in Spain in 1950, enabling the first commercial Talgo II service to be run on 14 July of that year, between Madrid, Spain and Hendaye, France. It was the first train in Spain to be authorized to travel at a service speed of up to . Continued collaboration with ACF led to the creation of the &quot;Talgo III&quot; during the 1960s. It was brought into service between Madrid and Barcelona in August 1964.

International rail travel between Spain and the rest of Europe had been historically hampered by the differing track gauge at either side of the Pyrenees. Recognising the value in effectively overcoming that impediment, Talgo developed its own variable-gauge vehicle system, which permitted the first international Talgo to be introduced on passenger service between Barcelona, Spain and Geneva, Switzerland, in 1969. Variable-gauge trains were soon a common feature of overnight services between various Spanish cities and destinations across Western Europe. Even into the 21st century, the variable-gauge system has largely remained unchanged, even on newly-built rolling stock. La Gineta is the site of a test track of the Talgo RD railway gauge changer.

During the 1970s, Talgo sought to better accommodate the demand for higher speed trains in Spain. As a consequence of its mountainous terrain, curved tracks prevailed, despite restricting line speeds due to the centrifugal forces exerted on the trains and their contents. To permit higher operating speeds under such conditions, the company developed a tilting train, the &quot;Talgo Pendular&quot;, that automatically compensated for centrifugal forces by tilting appropriately on bends. Without needing to modify the track infrastructure, this tilting train allowed operating speeds to be increased by up to 25 percent over conventional trains.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the company focused its activities largely on the manufacturing of coaching stock rather than locomotives. A renewed focus on locomotive development, incorporating the automatic variable gauge system, came about during the 1990s. The Talgo XXI pioneered various technologies for the company, including new high-speed running gear and hybrid propulsion technology. In 1988, the Spanish government announced its decision to construct a new dedicated high-speed line between Madrid and Seville. Talgo was keen to produce rolling stock for the new venture and immediately set about designing a new series of trains, the &quot;Talgo 350&quot;. A key feature of this trainset would be its maximum speed, which was . In 1998, Talgo partnered with the multinational rolling stock manufacturer Adtranz to collaborate on its bid to secure a contract to provide the rolling stock for the new high-speed line. 

The company&#x27;s long-term primary customer, and thus the main source of its revenues, is the Spanish railway operator Renfe. By 2001, Talgo was reportedly spending between 10 and 12 percent of its revenues on various research and development programmes. 

On 12 May 1999, Talgo announced it had signed a deal to acquire the Finnish rolling stock manufacturer Transtech Oy, which it subsequently reorganised as the wholly-owned subsidiary &quot;Talgo Oy&quot;. In March 2007, Talgo sold its shares in Talgo Oy to a combination of its local management and other Finnish investors, after which the Transtech name was readopted.

During the 2010s, it was decided that Talgo would be reorganised as a public company. In May 2015, the company made an initial public offering (IPO) on the Bolsa de Madrid, during which it was valued at €1.27 billion.

In recent decades, Talgo has made a renewed effort to expand its presence internationally. During the late 2010s, Talgo made arrangements to establish a new train manufacturing site in the United Kingdom in response to orders for its trains having been placed by multiple British railway operators. In the early 2020s, the company invested in new manufacturing facilities in India with the aiming of securing sizable orders from across the country&#x27;s railways.

In 2025 Basque company Sidenor acquired 20,7% of the company, taking control of it.

==Design==
Talgo trains are best known for their unconventional articulated railway passenger cars that use between-carriage bogies that Talgo patented in 1941, similar to the earlier Jacobs bogie. The wheels are mounted in pairs but not joined by an axle and the bogies are shared between coaches rather than underneath individual coaches. This allows a railway car to take a turn at higher speeds with less hunting oscillation. As the coaches are not mounted directly onto wheel bogies, the coaches are more easily insulated from track noise. This design has been proposed for further utilisation in the Talgo 22, double deck train with stepless access from the platform to the lower deck and between carriages.

Talgo trains fitted with variable-gauge axles can change rail gaugefor instance between and at the Spanish–French border interchange.

Since the introduction of the Talgo Pendular in 1980, the train tilts naturally inwards on curves, allowing it to run faster on curves without causing discomfort to passengers. The carriage tilting system pivots around the top of the suspension columns, which has the effect of partially cancelling the effects of lateral acceleration when cornering.

==Trains==
Talgo trains are divided into generations. They come in both locomotive-hauled and self-propelled versions.

===Talgo I===

The Talgo I was built in 1942 in Spain. The coaches were built at the &quot;Hijos de Juan Garay&quot; workshop in Oñati and the power car was built at the workshops of the &quot;Compañía del Norte&quot; in Valladolid. It was built as a prototype, and it was used to set several rail speed records. The first test run occurred between Madrid and Guadalajara, Castile–La Mancha in October 1942. It had a max speed of on uphills and on flat/downhills. The trainset was destroyed on February 5, 1944 after approximately 3000 km of testing in a fire at its storage location, a warehouse in Cerra Negro.

===Talgo II===
Talgo II coaches and locomotives were first built in 1950 at the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) works in the United States under the direction of Spanish engineers (the diesel–electric locomotives were assembled by ACF with electrical components made by General Electric). Talgo II carried most of the &quot;Jet Rocket&quot; train&#x27;s passengers between Chicago and Peoria, Illinois, after entering service on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the Rock Island line) in 1956. Slightly different coaches were later introduced, and the last car type of the &quot;Jet Rocket&quot; resembled that of the future Talgo III. The New York Central Railroad trialed a complete train until 1958 but saw little success.

Talgo IIs also entered service under Renfe as the Renfe Class 350, where they ran between Madrid and Palencia.

Talgo IIs were also built for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for its &quot;John Quincy Adams&quot; train from New York City to Boston, Massachusetts, and the Boston and Maine Railroad for its &quot;Speed Merchant&quot; train, running between Boston and Portland, Maine. Soon afterwards, Talgo II trains began running in Spain and were successfully operated until 1972.
===Talgo III===

Talgo III coaches and locomotives entered service in 1964, introducing longer cars and easy directional reversibility of the coaches. The Talgo III/RD was equipped with variable gauge axles, and this permitted the introduction, on 1 June 1969, of the first through train between Barcelona and Geneva (the &quot;Catalan Talgo&quot;), despite the difference in rail gauge. The same equipment was used for the &quot;Barcelona Talgo&quot;, which began operation on 26 May 1974 as the first-ever through train service between Barcelona and Paris.
===Talgo Pendular===

The Talgo Pendular (Talgo IV and Talgo V, also VI &amp; Talgo 200 or 6th generation), introduced in 1980, created the &quot;natural tilting&quot; train, using a passive system that tilts the carriages with no need for electronic sensors or hydraulic equipment. The wheels are mounted on mono axles between the carriages, and sitting on top of the axles are suspension columns. The carriages are attached to the top of the suspension columns and swing inwards as the train goes through a curve.

In 1988, a Talgo Pendular was used on trials for Amtrak on the Boston–New York corridor in the United States and on Deutsche Bahn lines in Germany. Trial commercial services with Talgo cars in the US commenced in 1994 between Seattle and Portland, and from 1998 different trains have been used on the Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; services from Vancouver, British Columbia to Seattle, Washington, continuing via Portland, Oregon to Eugene, Oregon. Five Talgo IV trains were in use in Argentina on the General Roca Railway. They have since been replaced by CRRC Dalian rolling stock. In September 2022, the Talgo IV sets were transported to the Villa Luro workshop to undergo repairs, aiming to add an extra daily service between Buenos Aires and Rosario. The sets used on the Amtrak Cascades have been replaced by Amtrak-owned Horizon cars.

Talgo 200 series trains are also in use in Kazakhstan for the Almaty–Astana overnight train.
===Talgo VII===

The Talgo VII introduced beginning in 2000 is used as a locomotive-pulled train set as well as intermediate cars for the multiple units Talgo 250, Talgo 350 and Talgo XXI. The carriages are similar to the Talgo Pendular type but have an air-controlled hydraulic brake system and power supply from head end power instead of diesel engine–generators in the end cars. Talgo VII trains have a car which has two pairs of wheels in the middle of the set (of cars) rather than at one end of the set, which is the case for earlier Talgo trains. All the other cars in the set have a single pair of wheels.
===Talgo 8===

The Series 8 passenger cars are similar to the Series VII cars, but the diesel generator car at one end of the train has a control cabin for push–pull operation and a two-axle end bogie. These trains are designed for the North American market. Talgo made an agreement in 2009 to build a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin which would initially supply two 14-car trainsets for the Amtrak &quot;Hiawatha&quot; until the project was cancelled. The company expressed hope the plant would later be used to build trains for other U.S. rail projects.

Early in 2010, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced that it had negotiated the purchase of two 13-car trainsets for use in the Pacific Northwest rail corridor between Eugene and Vancouver, British Columbia. These trainsets were also manufactured in Wisconsin and were delivered in 2013. The sets are currently operating in the &quot;Cascades&quot; corridor in the Pacific Northwest. They have been integrated with the five existing sets in regular service. The Series 8 trains offer passengers many modern amenities including high-speed Wi-Fi, reclining seats and a full-service bistro and lounge car.

In 2014, the state of Michigan expressed interest in operating the unused Talgo 8 cars for their Amtrak Wolverine service. Three years later, Amtrak proposed to lease or buy the unused cars in the wake of the 2017 Washington train derailment. Ultimately, the two trainsets were sold to Nigeria for use on the Lagos Rail Mass Transit.
===Talgo 9===
This series, which was originally designed for Russia and Kazakhstan, featured wide bodyshells and wheelsets. There are three versions: 1520 mm fixed gauge, 1520–1435 mm variable gauge, 1520–1676 mm variable gauge. They are used in the Berlin–Moscow line (December 2016) and St. Petersburg–Moscow–Samara (August 2020).

In July 2015, Talgo stated its intention to ship a Series 9 train to India at its own cost as a demonstration on the Mumbai–Delhi rail route. On 10 September 2016, the final successful test run of the Talgo 9 series coaches was completed in India.
===Talgo 250 HSR===
The Talgo 250 is a dual voltage electric push-pull train (AC/DC) equipped with variable gauge axles. This allows the units to be used on high-speed lines and on conventional broad gauge lines. A Talgo 250 train consists of two power cars and 11 Talgo VII intermediate coaches. This class was developed for Renfe (classed as S-130). One trainset (RENFE Class 730) was involved in the Santiago de Compostela accident on 24 July 2013.

Uzbekistan Railways ordered two Talgo 250 sets of a Russian gauge version in 2009. The first set arrived at Tashkent in July 2011.
===Talgo 250 Hybrid===

The Talgo 250 Hybrid is a dual-voltage, dual-power push-pull train equipped with variable gauge axles. The train is therefore also able to operate on non-electrified lines. A Talgo 250 Hybrid train consists of two power cars, two technical end coaches and nine Talgo VII intermediate coaches. The trains were developed for Renfe and classed initially as S-130H, later as S-730. They are rebuilt from existing Talgo 250 trains.
===Talgo 350 HSR===
The Talgo 350 entered service as the Renfe AVE Class 102 marking the company&#x27;s entry into the high-speed train manufacturing market. Tests with the prototype commenced in 1994, and Talgo 350 trains have been operating at a top commercial speed of 330 km/h on the Madrid–Barcelona and Madrid–Valladolid lines since 22 December 2007. This series of push-pull trains is designed to reach a speed of , although present lines and commercial services limit the speed to . The train consists of two power cars and Talgo VII intermediate cars with improved brakes and additional primary suspension.
===Talgo XXI HSR===

Talgo XXI is a project for a high-speed diesel-powered train, that operates in a push-pull with one or two power cars and Talgo VII intermediate cars. The North American version has four-axle power cars in compliance with United States FRA regulations. Only one train in compliance with European UIC standards has been built to date. Talgo reported that the Talgo XXI attained on the Olmedo–Medina del Campo high speed experimental line on 9 July 2002, which led to a claim for the world speed record for a diesel train. However, this claim was never proven. After the test runs the train was sold to the Spanish infrastructure authority ADIF as a measuring train for high-speed lines.

Possible specs are:
* Two MTU 12V 4000 R64 engines (two power car configuration) or one MTU 12V 4000 R84 engine (one power car configuration), up to 1,800 rpm, high-speed diesel, Euro IIIB compliant with diesel particulate filter and exhaust gas recirculation after-treatment system
* 2 x , () or 
* Voith hydraulic transmission
* Hydrodynamic and air braking
* Variable gauge
* 5 to 12 passenger coaches, depending on the setup
* Up to 400 seats
* Designed for a top speed of 
* Power car with a shared trailer axle
===Talgo AVRIL HSR===

Talgo has developed recently a push-pull train known as &quot;AVRIL&quot; (Alta Velocidad Rueda Independiente Ligero — Light High-Speed Independent Wheel), intended for speeds of . The system uses underfloor traction in the front and rear vehicles, with the intermediate carriages having the Talgo Pendular system (which cannot use motored axles on the axles corresponding to the system). The train also has the option for variable gauge axles. Starting with the concept stage in 2009, it began dynamic testing on the Spanish high-speed network in 2014, and was approved in May 2016. It won its first major contract in November 2016 from Renfe for the Mediterranean corridor in Spain, and its link to Paris. The first AVRIL trains started operations in May 2024 on routes from Madrid to Catalonia, Asturias and Galicia.
=== Talgo Egypt ===

In April 2019, Egypt ordered new Talgo trains. Egypt contracted for six trains from Talgo Company, but they became seven trains due to a delay in the delivery date to Egypt. This negates the words of the Minister of Transport who justified that train is a gift from the company for President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.

On 9 August 2022, Egypt contracted for seven trains from Talgo, which included 15-year maintenance, for 280 million euros. The trains will be delivered at the beginning of 2024.
==Variable Gauge Axles (VGA)==
In addition to the multiple units with variable gauge, in 2005 Talgo built a prototype of a variable-gauge locomotive (the L-9202, TRAV-CA, 130-901 or Virgen del Buen Camino).

<doc id="517298" wikidata="Q521151" url="?curid=517298" title="Baryton">
<text>The baryton is a bowed string instrument similar to the viol, but distinguished by an extra set of sympathetic but also pluckable strings. It was in regular use in Europe until the end of the 18th century.

==Design==

The baryton can be viewed as a sort of augmented bass viol. It is similar in size to the latter instrument and likewise has six or seven strings of gut (typically D G C E A D, although &quot;scordatura&quot; was used), arranged over a fretted fingerboard and played with a bow. The instrument is held vertically and is supported by the player&#x27;s legs (rather than with an end-pin as in the modern cello).

The baryton differs from the bass viol in having an additional set of wire strings. These perform two functions: they vibrate sympathetically with the bowed strings, enriching the tone, and they can also be plucked by the left thumb of the performer, creating a contrasting tonal quality. As can be seen in the illustration, the bowed strings are placed on the left, where they can be easily fingered by the player&#x27;s left hand. The plucked strings are on the right; they are reachable by the player&#x27;s thumb from the rear, where the back of the instrument&#x27;s neck is left open.

==History==
===The historical baryton===

There are only about 50 historical barytons for which we have evidence, either in the form of documents or the instrument itself. Many of the latter have been modified from their original form. Thus, tracing the history of the baryton is a difficult task.

Concerning the origin of the baryton, Pamplin suggests that &quot;the instrument probably originated in England in the early 17th century when the characteristics of two instruments, the viola da gamba and the bandora, were combined into one hybrid instrument&quot;. Early evidence for the existence of the baryton is found in Marin Mersenne&#x27;s work &quot;Cogitata Physico-Mathematica&quot; (1644). According for Fruchtman, &quot;Mersenne stated that the English constructed a viol or lyre much admired by King James. The instrument had six bowed strings as well as metal strings behind the neck. The thumb of the left hand plucked the metal strings, which were made to sound with the bowed notes. If this information is accurate, the baryton must have been known in England before 1625, the end of King James&#x27; reign.&quot; The earliest baryton that survives today dates from 1647; it was made by Magnus Feldlen in Vienna and is currently in the musical instrument collection of the Royal College of Music in London.

In London a performance at Marylebone Gardens was announced in 1744, Mr Ferrand was to perform on &quot;the Pariton, an instrument never played on in public before&quot;.

The instrument was never particularly popular, but &quot;it acquired a certain cachet in courtly circles, particularly in south Germany and Austria&quot; (Pamplin). The compositions for the instrument by Haydn and his students and colleagues represented a last hurrah for the baryton; by the early 19th century it had gone out of style and ceased to attract new compositions. The Haydn-era baryton was different from earlier versions in a crucial respect: the sympathetic strings were tuned a full octave higher than previously. This helped the baryton to stand out from the other instruments (viola, cello) in the baryton trio, the primary form in which Haydn wrote. Since the Haydn oeuvre tends to dominate the field today, the Haydn-type tuning has become the standard. Czech composer Vaclav Pichl also wrote for the baryton.

===Modern revival===

The baryton was &quot;completely neglected&quot; (Hsu) in the nineteenth century, but in the twentieth, with the rise of the authentic performance movement in classical music, new barytons were built and played. Initially, these instruments were heavily constructed, more in the manner of a cello than a bass viol (they were thus sometimes called &quot;cellitons&quot;), but (much as with the parallel history of the harpsichord revival) eventually lighter instruments were constructed that more closely followed their historical antecedents.

Probably the first person to initiate the revival of the baryton was Christian Döbereiner in Munich. In 1934 he ordered a copy of an instrument by Simon Schödler (1782) from the renowned luthier, Ferdinand Wilhelm Jaura in Munich. The first performance in modern times on that baryton took place in Munich in 1936, which featured a trio by Haydn. This instrument forms part of the Vazquez Collection of Historical String Instruments and is frequently employed in performance by the Orpheon Foundation. A complete documentation of the Jaura Baryton is available at the Orpheon Foundation web site.

Among the modern active baryton players are Jeremy Brooker, Kazimierz Gruszczyński, Balázs Kakuk (Haydn Baryton Trio of Budapest), José Manuel Hernández, John Hsu, Roland Hutchinson, José Vázquez, Kenneth Slowik and Matthew Baker (Valencia Baryton Project).

With the revival of the baryton, a body of recorded work has gradually emerged. Several ensembles have produced recordings of individual works, and the Esterházy Ensemble (Michael Brüssing, baryton) has issued a set of recordings that cover the entire Haydn oeuvre.

The Swiss composer Klaus Huber has written an important solo part for the instrument in his work (2004).

==Repertoire==
Of the repertoire for this instrument, the best known works are the 175 compositions written by Joseph Haydn for his patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterházy, who enjoyed playing this instrument. Of these, 126 are trios for viola, cello and baryton. They were written in the earlier part of Haydn&#x27;s career, from 1762 to 1775. Andreas Lidel was also notable for his compositions that included baryton.

==Nomenclature==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the name of the instrument is a loan word from French &quot;baryton&quot; or Italian &quot;baritono&quot;, and ultimately derives from Greek &quot;bary-&quot; + &quot;tonos&quot; &#x27;deep-pitched&#x27;. Alternate spellings include: bariton, barydon, paradon, paridon, pariton, viola paradon, viola di bordoni, [Italian] viola di bardone, [German] viola di bordone. The name lyra bastard is also sometimes used, though technically speaking it is incorrect.

<text>Siegbert Tarrasch (; 5 March 1862 – 17 February 1934) was a German chess player, considered to have been among the strongest players and most influential theoreticians of the late 19th and early 20th century.

==Life==
Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in what was then Prussian Silesia and now is Poland. Having finished school in 1880, he left Breslau to study medicine in Berlin and then in Halle. With his family, he settled in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich, setting up a successful medical practice. He had five children. Tarrasch was Jewish, converted to Christianity in 1909, and was a patriotic German who lost a son in World War I, yet he faced antisemitism in the early stages of the Third Reich.

== Chess career ==

A medical doctor by profession, Tarrasch may have been the best player in the world in the early 1890s. He scored heavily against the ageing World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz in tournaments (+3−0=1) but refused an opportunity to challenge Steinitz for the world title in 1892 because of the demands of his medical practice.
Soon afterwards, in St. Petersburg in 1893, Tarrasch drew a hard-fought match against Steinitz&#x27; challenger Mikhail Chigorin (+9−9=4) after leading most of the way. He also won four major tournaments in succession: Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, Dresden 1892, and Leipzig 1894.

However, after Emanuel Lasker became world chess champion in 1894, Tarrasch could not match him. Fred Reinfeld wrote: &quot;Tarrasch was destined to play second fiddle for the rest of his life.&quot; For example, Lasker scored much better against mutual opponents, e.g. vs. Chigorin, Tarrasch had +2 over 34 games while Lasker scored +7 in 21; vs. Akiba Rubinstein, Tarrasch was −8 without a single win, while Lasker scored +2−1=2; vs. David Janowski, Tarrasch scored +3 compared to Lasker&#x27;s huge +22; vs. Géza Maróczy, Tarrasch was +1 over 16 games while Lasker scored +4−0=1, vs. Richard Teichmann Tarrasch scored +8−5=2, while Lasker beat him all four tournament games. However, Tarrasch had a narrow plus score against Harry Nelson Pillsbury of +6−5=2, while Lasker was even +5−5=4. Still, Tarrasch remained a powerful player, demolishing Frank Marshall in a match in 1905 (+8−1=8), and winning Ostend 1907 over Schlechter, Janowski, Marshall, Burn, and Chigorin.

There was no love lost between Tarrasch and Lasker. The story goes that when they were introduced at the opening of their 1908 championship match, Tarrasch clicked his heels, bowed stiffly, and said, &quot;To you, Dr. Lasker, I have only three words, check and mate&quot;—then left the room. When Lasker finally agreed to a title match in 1908, he beat Tarrasch convincingly +8−3=5.

Tarrasch continued to be one of the leading players in the world for a while. He finished fourth in the very strong St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, behind only World Champion Lasker and future World Champions José Raúl Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine, and ahead of Marshall, Ossip Bernstein, Rubinstein, Nimzowitsch, Blackburne, Janowski, and Gunsberg. His win against Capablanca in the 19th round, though much less famous than Lasker&#x27;s win against Capablanca the round before, was essential to enable Lasker to achieve his famous come-from-behind victory over Capablanca in the tournament. This tournament was probably Tarrasch&#x27;s swan song, because his chess career was not very successful after this, although he still played some highly regarded games.

Tarrasch lost +0-5=1 to Lasker in a 1916 match.

== Chess teachings ==
Tarrasch was a very influential chess writer, and was called &quot;Praeceptor Germaniae&quot;, meaning &quot;Teacher of Germany.&quot; He took some of Wilhelm Steinitz&#x27;s ideas (&quot;e.g.&quot; control of the center, , ) and made them more accessible to the average chess player. In other areas, he departed from Steinitz. He emphasized piece much more than Steinitz did, and disliked cramped positions, saying that they &quot;had the germ of defeat.&quot;

Tarrasch formulated a very important rule in rook endgames that is often called the Tarrasch rule:

:The rooks belong &quot;behind&quot; passed pawns, behind their own in order to support their advance, behind the enemy&#x27;s in order to impede their advance.

=== Chess publications ===
In 1895, Tarrasch&#x27;s book &quot;Dreihundert Schachpartien&quot; was published. It was first translated into English in 1959 by Robin Ault and John Kirwan in a limited edition and a commercial edition in 1999 when S. Schwarz put out &quot;Three Hundred Chess Games.&quot; Tarrasch released &quot;Die moderne Schachpartie&quot; in 1912, but it has not been translated yet. He wrote a famous book about the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, which was translated into English in 1993. His fourth major book &quot;Das Schachspiel&quot; (1931), was translated by G. E. Smith and T. G. Bone as &quot;The Game of Chess&quot; (1935, ). It was his last book and his most successful.

He edited the magazine &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot; in 1897, and &quot;Tarrasch&#x27;s Schachzeitung&quot;, for the last two years of his life.

== Clash with hypermodern school ==

He was a target of the hypermodern school, led by Richard Réti, Aron Nimzowitsch, and Savielly Tartakower, all of whom criticized his ideas as dogmatic. However, many modern masters regard Tarrasch&#x27;s actual &quot;play&quot; as not dogmatic. According to American grandmaster Andrew Soltis, Tarrasch&#x27;s chess was &quot;all about piece mobility&quot;.

As an example of his playing style see his victory on the Black side of the Advance French against Louis Paulsen (Nuremberg 1888):

:1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3 cxd4 Tarrasch gives this an exclamation mark, and points out that 6...Bd7 allows 7.dxc5 with a good game. However, most accounts credit Nimzowitsch with such anti-dogmatic hypermodern inventiveness when he played 7.dxc5 against Gersz Salwe almost a quarter of a century later. 7. cxd4 Bd7 8.

== Contributions to opening theory ==
A number of chess openings are named after Tarrasch, with the most notable being:
*The Tarrasch Defense, Tarrasch&#x27;s favorite line against the Queen&#x27;s Gambit in which Black takes on an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5!? 4.cxd5 exd5. A main line is then 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.0-0 0-0. Tarrasch famously proclaimed, &quot;The future will decide who has erred in estimating this defense, I or the chess world!&quot;; today it is considered sound, though unfashionable.
*The Tarrasch Variation of the French Defense (3.Nd2), which Tarrasch late in his career considered to be refuted by 3...c5 4.exd5 exd5, with Black again &quot;acquiring&quot; an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn. This is not thought a refutation today, but is still one of Black&#x27;s most important lines.
*The Tarrasch Variation of the Ruy Lopez, usually known as the Open Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4).

== Famous Tarrasch combinations ==

In the game &quot;Tarrasch versus Allies&quot;, Black seems to be holding here (at least against an immediate catastrophe), because the black queen guards against Qb7+ (followed by Kxa5 Ra1#), while the black rook on c8 defends against Rxc5#. Tarrasch played the ingenious interference move 31.Bc7! (known as a Plachutta interference because the pieces both move orthogonally). This blocks off both defences, and whatever piece captures becomes overloaded. That is, if 31...Rxc7, the rook is overloaded, having to look after both the key squares, since the queen is blocked from b7. So White would play 32.Qb7+ Rxb7, deflecting the rook from defence of c5, allowing 33.Rxc5#. But if Black plays instead 31...Qxc7, the queen blocks off the rook&#x27;s defence of c5 and becomes overloaded: 32.Rxc5+ Qxc5 deflects the queen from defence of b7, allowing 33.Qb7+ Kxa5 34.Ra1#. Black actually resigned after this move.
In the game against Carl Walbrodt, Tarrasch played rather poorly, and his opponent had the better of him for a long time. But the game was redeemed by the following startling combination: 34.Rxd4 seems obvious, because 34...cxd4 allows 35.Bxd4 winning the queen. But Black has a seemingly strong counterattack which had to be foreseen ... 34...Nxg3 35.Nxg3 Rxg3+ 36.hxg3 Rxg3+ 37.Kf1! Rxd3 and now the startling 38.Rg4!! with devastating threats of 39. Rf8+ mating and Bxe5 not to mention cxd3 to follow. Black resigned.

<text>Chenghai (; postal: Tenghai; Teochew: Thěng Hài) is a district of the city of Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.

Located at the Han River Delta in the southeast part of Guangdong Province, Chenghai spans from 116°41&#x27; to 116°54&#x27; E longitude and 23°23&#x27; to 23°38&#x27; N latitude. Chenghai is an important transportation hub of the area around east Guangdong, the southeast part of Fujian and south Jiangxi Province, which is known as the &quot;Gateway of East Guangdong&quot;. The total area of this district is 345.23 square kilometres.

== History ==

Chenghai was known as one of &quot;Eight Counties of Chaozhou&quot; () in Qing Dynasty and Republic of China period. It was founded as a county in 1563 AD, combining by the coastal lands separated from Haiyang County, Jieyang County and Raoping County, and under Chao Prefecture (Teochew)&#x27;s jurisdiction. The name Chenghai, meaning &quot;clear [the &quot;Wokou&quot; of] the sea&quot; (), was used as the county name due to the Jiajing wokou raids, which also indicated the reason of Chenghai&#x27;s establishment. Chenghai was dissolved in 1666 when Kangxi Emperor banned on foreign trade but re-founded seven years later.

In 1860, Shantou, which lay in the southwest of Chenghai, was opened for foreigners and became a trading port according to Treaty of Tientsin. Shantou separated from Chenghai and became a city in 1921. Then Chenghai County was administered by Shantou conversely. On 21 June 1939, Japanese troops invaded the county town of Chenghai. Japanese force occupied Chenghai until 15 August 1945. The Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army captured Chenghai on 24 October 1949, 23 days after the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded.

From 1994 onward, Chenghai was upgraded to a county-level city and was administered by the Provincial Government directly (custody by Shantou). On 19 May 2003, Chenghai was absorbed as a district by Shantou. Chenghai became a part of Shantou Special Economic Zone on 1 May 2011.

== Climate ==
Chenghai has a sunny climate, with plenty of rainfall, belonging to south subtropical monsoon climate. Controlled by cold high atmospheric pressure from the polar, winters are dry. Summers are rainy with high temperatures.

<text>A geocode is a code that represents a geographic entity (location or object). It is a unique identifier of the entity, to distinguish it from others in a finite set of geographic entities. In general the &quot;geocode&quot; is a human-readable and short identifier.

Typical geocodes and entities represented by it:
* &quot;Country code&quot; and subdivision code. Polygon of the administrative boundaries of a country or a subdivision. The main examples are ISO codes: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g. codice_1 for Afghanistan or codice_2 for Brazil), and its subdivision conventions, such as subdivision codes (e.g. codice_3 for Ghor province) or subdivision codes (e.g. codice_4 for Amazonas state).
* &quot;DGG cell ID&quot;. Identifier of a cell of a discrete global grid: a Geohash code (e.g. ~0.023 km2 cell codice_5 at the Brazilian&#x27;s center) or an OLC code (e.g. ~0.004 km2 cell codice_6 at the same point).
* &quot;Postal code&quot;. Polygon of a postal area: a CEP code (e.g. codice_7 represents a Brazilian&#x27;s central area for postal distribution).

The ISO 19112:2019 standard (section 3.1.2) adopted the term &quot;geographic identifier&quot; instead geocode, to encompass long labels: &quot;spatial reference in the form of a label or code that identifies a location&quot;. For example, for ISO, the country name “People&#x27;s Republic of China” is a label.

Geocodes are mainly used (in general as an atomic data type) for labelling, data integrity, geotagging and spatial indexing.

In theoretical computer science a &quot;geocode system&quot; is a locality-preserving hashing function.

== Classification ==
There are some common aspects of many geocodes (or geocode systems) that can be used as classification criteria:
* &quot;Ownership&quot;: proprietary or free, differing by its licences.
* &quot;Formation&quot;: the geocode can be originated from a name (ex. abbreviation of official name the country) or from mathematical function (encoding algorithm to compress latitude-longitude). See &quot;geocode system&quot; types below (of names and of grids).
* &quot;Hierarchy&quot;: geocode&#x27;s syntax hierarchy corresponding to the spatial hierarchy of its represented entities. A geocode system can hierarchical (name or grid) or non-hierarchical.
* &quot;Covering&quot;: global or partial. The entities (represented by the geocodes) are in all globe (e. g. geographical points) or is delimited the theme (e.g. only terrestrial areas) or by the ownership&#x27;s jurisdiction (e.g. only into a country).
* &quot;Type of the represented entity&quot;: type of geometry. Point (the geocode can be translated to a Geo URI), grid cell (the geocode system is related with a DGG) or polygon (typically administrative boundaries delimitations).

** special hierarchical grids, with global covering and equal-area cells, can be classified as &quot;DGGS cell&quot;
** some non-standard geographic entities, can be classified also by its coordinate system and elipsoid of reference (e.g. UTM). The &quot;de facto&quot; standard is the WGS84.
* &quot;Scope of use&quot;: general use vs specialized (e.g. airport geocodes).
== System ==

The set of all geocodes used as unique identifiers of the cells of a full-coverage of the geographic surface (or any well-defined area like a country or the oceans), is a geocode system (also named &quot;geocode scheme&quot;). The syntax and semantic of the geocodes are also components of the system definition:
* geocode syntax: the characters that can be used, blocks of characters and its size and order. Example: country codes use two letters of the alphabet (chacacter set A-Z). The most common way to describe formally is by regular expression (e.g. codice_8).
* geocode semantic: the meaning of the geocode, usually expressed by associating the code with a geographical entity type. Can be described formally is by an ontology, an UML class diagram or any Entity-relationship model. In general the semantic can be deduced by its formation or encoding/decoding process. Example: each Geohash code can be expressed by a rectangular area in the map, and the rectangle coordinates is obtained by its decoding process.

Many syntax and semantic characteristics are also summarized by classification.

=== Encode and decode ===

Any geocode can be translated from a formal (and expanded) expression of the geographical entity, or vice versa, the geocode translated to entity. The first is named encode process, the second decode. The actors and process involved, as defined by OGC, are:

;geocoder: A software agent that transforms the description of a geographic entity (e.g. location name or latitude/longitude coordinates), into a normalized data and encodes it as a geocode.

;geocoder service: A geocoder implemented as web service (or similar service interface), that accepts a set of geographic entity descriptors as input. The request is &quot;sent&quot; to the Geocoder Service, which processes the request and returns the resulting geocodes. More general services can also return geographic features (e.g. GeoJSON object) represented by the geocodes.

;geocoding: Geocoding refers to the assignment of geocodes or coordinates to geographically reference data provided in a textual format. Examples are the two letter country codes and coordinates computed from addresses. Note: when a physical addressing schemes (street name and house number) is expressed in a standardized and simplified way, it can be conceived as geocode. So, the term geocoding (used for addresses) sometimes is generalized for geocodes.

In spatial indexing applications the geocode can also be translated between human-readable (e.g. hexadecimal) and internal (e.g. binary 64-bit unsigned integer) representations.

=== Systems of standard names ===
Geocodes like &quot;country codes&quot;, city codes, etc. comes from a table of official names, and the corresponding official codes and geometries (typically polygon of administrative areas). &quot;Official&quot; in the context of control and consensus, typically a table controlled by a standards organization or governmental authority. So, the most general case is a table of &quot;standard names&quot; and the corresponding &quot;standard codes&quot; (and its official geometries).

Strictly speaking, the &quot;name&quot; related to a geocode is a toponym, and the table (e.g. toponym to standard code) is the resource for toponym resolution: is the relationship process, usually effectuated by a software agent, between a toponym and &quot;an unambiguous spatial footprint of the same place&quot;. Any standardized system of toponym resolution, having codes or encoded abbreviations, can be used as &quot;geocode system&quot;. The &quot;resolver&quot; agent in this context is also a &quot;geocoder&quot;.

Sometimes names are translated into numeric codes, to be compact or machine-readable. Since numbers, in this case, are name identifiers, we can consider &quot;numeric names&quot; — so this set of codes will be a kind of &quot;system of standard names&quot;.

==== Hierarchical naming ====

In the geocode context, space partitioning is the process of dividing a geographical space into two or more disjoint subsets, resulting in a mosaic of subdivisions. Each subdivision can be partitioned again, recursively, resulting in an hierarchical mosaic.

When subdivisions&#x27;s names are expressed as codes, and code syntax can be decomposed into a parent-child relations, through a well-defined syntactic scheme, the geocode set configures a hierarchical system. A geocode fragment (associated to a subdivision name) can be an abbreviation, numeric or alphanumeric code.

A popular example is the ISO 3166-2 geocode system, representing country names and the names of respective administrative subdivisions separated by hyphen. For example codice_9 is Germany, a simple geocode, and its subdivisions (illustrated) are codice_10 for Baden-Württemberg, codice_11 for Bayern, ..., codice_12 for Nordrhein-Westfalen, etc. The scope is only the first level of the hierarchy. For more levels there are other conventions, like HASC code. The HASC codes are alphabetic and its fragments have constant length (2 letters). Examples:

:codice_13 - North Rhine-Westphalia. A two-level hierarchical geocode.
:codice_14 - Kreis Coesfeld. A 3-level hierarchical geocode.

Two geocodes of a &quot;hierarchical geocode system&quot; with same prefix represents different parts of the same location. For instance codice_14 and codice_16 represents geographically interior parts of codice_13, the common prefix.

Changing the &quot;subdivision criteria&quot; we can obtain other hierarchical systems. For example, for hydrological criteria there is a geocode system, the US&#x27;s hydrologic unit code (HUC), that is a numeric representation of &quot;basin names&quot; in a hierarchical syntax schema (first level illustred). For example, the HUC codice_18 is the identifier of &quot;Pacific Northwest Columbia basin&quot;; HUC codice_19 of &quot;Lower Snake basin&quot;, a spatial subset of HUC codice_18 and a superset of codice_21 (&quot;Imnaha River&quot;).

=== Systems of regular grids ===


Inspired in the classic alphanumeric grids, a discrete global grid (DGG) is a regular mosaic which covers the entire Earth&#x27;s surface (the globe). The regularity of the mosaic is defined by the use of cells of same shape in all the grid, or &quot;near the same shape and near same area&quot; in a region of interest, like a country.

All cells of the grid have an identifier (DGG&#x27;s cell ID), and the center of the cell can be used as reference for cell ID conversion into geographical point. When a compact human-readable expression of the cell ID is standardized, it becomes a geocode.

Geocodes of different &quot;geocode systems&quot; can represent the same position in the globe, with same shape and precision, but differ in string-length, digit-alphabet, separators, etc. Non-global grids also differ by scope, and in general are geometrically optimized (avoid overlaps, gaps or loss of uniformity) for the local use.

==== Hierarchical grids ====
Each cell of a grid can be transformed into a new local grid, in a recurring process. In the illustrated example, the cell codice_22 is a sub-cell of codice_23, that is a sub-cell of codice_24. A system of geographic regular grid references is the base of a &quot;hierarchical geocode system&quot;.

Two geocodes of a &quot;hierarchical geocode grid system&quot; can use the prefix rule: geocodes with same prefix represents different parts of the same broader location. Using again the side illustration: codice_25 and codice_26 represents geographically interior parts of codice_24, the common prefix.

Hierarchical geocode can be split into keys. The Geohash codice_28 is the key codice_29 of the cell codice_30, that is a cell of codice_31 (key codice_32), and so on, per-digit keys. The OLC codice_33 is the key codice_34 of the cell codice_35, that is a cell of codice_36 (key codice_34), and so on, two-digit keys. In the case of OLC there is a second key schema, after the codice_38 separator: codice_39 is the key codice_40 of the cell codice_6. It uses two key schemas. Some geocodes systems (e.g. S2 geometry) also use initial prefix with non-hierarchical key schema.

In general, as technical and non-compact optional representation, geocode systems (based on hierarchical grids) also offer the possibility of expressing their cell identifier with a fine-grained schema, by longer path of keys. For example, the Geohash codice_42, which is a base32 code, can be expanded to base4 codice_43, which is also a schema with per-digit keys. Geometrically, each Geohash cell is a rectangle that subdivides space recurrently into 32 new rectangles, so, base4 subdividing into 4, is the encoding-expansion limit.

The uniformity of shape and area of cells in a grid can be important for other uses, like spatial statistics. There are standard ways to build a grid covering the entire globe with cells of equal area, regular shape and other properties: Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) is a series of discrete global grids satisfying all standardized requirements defined in 2017 by the OGC.
When human-readable codes obtained from cell identifiers of a DGGS are also standardized, it can be classified as &quot;DGGS based geocode system&quot;.

=== Name-and-grid systems ===
There are also mixed systems, using a syntactical partition, where for example the first part (code prefix) is a name-code and the other part (code suffix) is a grid-code. Example:

: Mapcode entrance to the elevator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris is codice_44, where codice_45 is the name-code and codice_46 is the grid-code. Semantically France is the context, to obtain its local grid.

For mnemonic coherent semantics, in fine-grained geocode applications, the mixed solutions are most suitable.

== Shortening grid-based codes by context ==

Any &quot;geocode system&quot; based on regular grid, in general is also a shorter way to express a latitudinal/longitudinal coordinate. But a geocode with more than 6 characters is difficult for remember. On the other hand, a geocode based on standard name (or abbreviation or the complete name) is easier to remember.

This suggests that a &quot;mixed code&quot; can solve the problem, reducing the number of characters when a name can be used as the &quot;context&quot; for the grid-based geocode. For example, in a book where the author says &quot;all geocodes here are contextualized by the chapter&#x27;s city&quot;. In the chapter about Paris, where all places have a Geohash with prefix codice_47, that code can be removed —. For instance Geohash codice_48 can be reduced to codice_49, or, by an explicit code for context &quot;FR-Paris codice_49&quot;. This is only possible when the context resolution (e.g. translation from &quot;FR-Paris&quot; to the prefix codice_47) is well-known.

In fact a methodology exists for hierarchical grid-based geocodes with non-variable size, where the code prefix describes a broader area, which can be associated with a name. So, it is possible to shorten by replacing the prefix to the associated context. The most usual context is an official name. Examples:

The examples of the &quot;Mixed reference&quot; column are significantly easier than remembering &quot;DGG code&quot; column. The methods vary, for example OLC can be shortened by elimination of its first four digits and attaching a suitable sufficiently close locality.

When the mixed reference is also short (9 characters in the second example) and there are a syntax convention to express it (suppose codice_52), this convention is generating a new name-and-grid geocode system. This is not the case of the first example because, strictly speaking, &quot;Cape Verde, Praia&quot; is not a code.

To be both, a name-and-grid system and also a mixed reference convention, the system must be reversible. Pure name-and-grid systems, like Mapcode, with no way to transform it into a global code, is not a mixed reference, because there is no algorithm to transform the mixed geocode into a grid-based geocode.

== Cataloged examples ==

=== In use, general scope ===
Geocodes in use and with general scope:

=== In use, alternative address ===
Geocodes can be used in place of official street names and/or house numbers, particularly when a given location has not been assigned an address by authorities. They can also be used as an &quot;alternative address&quot; if it can be converted to a Geo URI. Even if the geocode is not the official designation for a location, it can be used as a &quot;local standard&quot; to allow homes to receive deliveries, access emergency services, register to vote, etc.

=== In use, postal codes ===
Geocodes in use, as postal codes. A geocode recognized by Universal Postal Union and adopted as &quot;official postal code&quot; by a country, is also a valid postal code. Not all postal codes are geographic, and for some postal code systems, there are codes that are not geocodes (e.g. in UK system). Samples, not a complete list:

=== In use, telephony and radio ===
Geocodes in use for telephony or radio broadcasting scope:
* ITU-R country codes
* ITU-T country calling codes
* ITU-T mobile calling codes
* Maidenhead Locator System (used by amateur radio operators)
* Marsden Squares

=== In use, others ===

* National Topographic System in Canada

===Other standards===
Some standards and name servers include: ISO 3166, FIPS, INSEE, Geonames, IATA and ICAO.

A number of commercial solutions have also been proposed:

<doc id="517306" wikidata="Q223898" url="?curid=517306" title="All-India Muslim League">
<text>The All-India Muslim League (AIML) was a political party founded in 1906 in Dhaka, British India with the goal of securing Muslim interests in South Asia. Although initially espousing a united India with interfaith unity, the Muslim League later led the Pakistan Movement, calling for a separate Muslim homeland after the British exit from India.

The party arose out of the need for the political representation of Muslims in British India, especially during the Indian National Congress-sponsored massive Hindu opposition to the 1905 partition of Bengal. During the 1906 annual meeting of the All India Muslim Education Conference held in Israt Manzil Palace, Dhaka, the Nawab of Dhaka, Khwaja Salimullah, forwarded a proposal to create a political party which would protect the interests of Muslims in British India. He suggested the political party be named the &#x27;All-India Muslim League&#x27;. The motion was unanimously passed by the conference, leading to the official formation of the All-India Muslim League in Dhaka. It remained an elitist organisation until 1937, when the leadership began mobilising the Muslim masses, which turned the league into a popular organisation.

The Muslim League played a decisive role in the 1940s, becoming a driving force behind the division of India along religious lines and the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in 1947.

After the Partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, the All-India Muslim League was formally disbanded in India. The League was officially succeeded by the Pakistan Muslim League, which eventually split into several political parties. Other groups diminished to a minor party, that too only in Kerala state of India. In Bangladesh, the Muslim League was revived in 1976, but it was reduced in size, rendering it insignificant in the political arena. In India, a separate independent entity called the Indian Union Muslim League was formed, which continues to have a presence in the Indian parliament to this day.

==History==
===Foundation===


With the sincere efforts by the pioneers of the Congress to attract Muslims to their sessions, the majority of the Islamic leadership, with the exception of few scholars (like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and Syed Ameer Ali who focused more on Islamic education and scientific developments), rejected the notion that India has two distinct communities to be represented separately in Congress sessions.

Syed Ahmad Khan, in 1888, at Meerut, said, &quot;After this long preface I wish to explain what method my nation — nay, rather the whole people of this country — ought to pursue in political matters. I will treat in regular sequence of the political questions of India, in order that you may have full opportunity of giving your attention to them. The first of all is this — In whose hands shall the administration and the Empire of India rest? Now, suppose that all English, and the whole English army, were to leave India, taking with them all their cannon and their splendid weapons and everything, then who would be rulers of India? Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations — the Mahomedans and the Hindus — could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other and thrust it down. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable.&quot;

In 1886, Sir Syed founded the Muhammadan Educational Conference, but a self-imposed ban prevented it from discussing politics. Its original goal was to advocate for British education, especially science and literature, among India&#x27;s Muslims. The conference, in addition to generating funds for Sir Syed&#x27;s Aligarh Muslim University, motivated the Muslim upper class to propose an expansion of educational uplift elsewhere, known as the Aligarh Movement. In turn, this new awareness of Muslim needs helped stimulate a political consciousness among Muslim elites, For a few of them, many years after the death of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan the All-India Muslim League was formed in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

The formation of a Muslim political party on the national level was seen as essential by 1901. The first stage of its formation was the meeting held at Lucknow in September 1906, with the participation of representatives from all over India. The decision for the re-consideration to form the all-Indian Muslim political party was taken and further proceedings were adjourned until the next meeting of the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference. The Simla Deputation reconsidered the issue in October 1906 and decided to frame the objectives of the party on the occasion of the annual meeting of the Educational Conference, which was scheduled to be held in Dhaka. Meanwhile, Nawab Salimullah Khan published a detailed scheme through which he suggested the party to be named All-India Muslim Confederacy.

Pursuant to the decisions taken earlier at the Lucknow meeting and later in Simla, the annual meeting of the All-India Muhammadan Educational Conference was held in Dhaka from 27 December until 30 December 1906. Three thousand delegates attended, headed by both Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk Kamboh and Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk (the Secretary of the Muhammaden Educational Conference), in which they explained its objectives and stressed the unity of Muslims under the banner of an association. It was formally proposed by Nawab Salimullah Khan and supported by Hakim Ajmal Khan, Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Zafar Ali Khan, Syed Nabiullah, a barrister from Lucknow, Ibraheem Fazili and Syed Zahur Ahmad, an eminent lawyer, as well as several others.

===Separate electorates===
The Muslim League&#x27;s insistence on separate electorates and reserved seats in the Imperial Council were granted in the Indian Councils Act after the League held protests in India and lobbied London.

The draft proposals for the reforms communicated on 1 October 1908 provided Muslims with reserved seats in all councils, with nominations only being maintained in Punjab. The communication displayed how much the Government had accommodated Muslim demands and showed an increase in Muslim representation in the Imperial and provincial legislatures. But the Muslim League&#x27;s demands were only fully met in UP and Madras. However, the Government did accept the idea of separate electorates. The idea had not been accepted by the Secretary of State, who proposed mixed electoral colleges, causing the Muslim League to agitate and the Muslim press to protest what they perceived to be a betrayal of the Viceroy&#x27;s assurance to the Simla deputation.

On 23 February Morley told the House of Lords that Muslims demanded separate representation and accepted them. This was the League&#x27;s first victory. But the Indian Councils Bill did not fully satisfy the demands of the Muslim League. It was based on the October 1908 communique in which Muslims were only given a few reserved seats. The Muslim League&#x27;s London branch opposed the bill and in a debate obtained the support of several parliamentarians. In 1909 the members of the Muslim League organised a Muslim protest. The Reforms Committee of Minto&#x27;s council believed that Muslims had a point and advised Minto to discuss with some Muslim leaders. The Government offered a few more seats to Muslims in compromise but would not agree to fully satisfy the League&#x27;s demand.

Minto believed that the Muslims had been given enough while Morley was still not certain because of the pressure Muslims could apply on the government. The Muslim League&#x27;s central committee once again demanded separate electorates and more representation on 12 September 1909. While Minto was opposed, Morley feared that the Bill would not pass parliament without the League&#x27;s support and he once again discussed Muslim representation with the League leadership. This was successful. The Aga Khan compromised so that Muslims would have two more reserved seats in the Imperial Council. The Muslim League hesitantly accepted the compromise.

===Early years===
Sultan Muhammad Shah (Aga Khan III) was appointed the first honorary president of the Muslim League, though he did not attend the Dhaka inaugural session. There were also six vice-presidents, a secretary, and two joint secretaries initially appointed for a three-year term, proportionately from different provinces. The League&#x27;s constitution was framed in 1907, espoused in the &quot;Green Book,&quot; written by Mohammad Ali Jauhar.

Aga Khan III shared Ahmad Khan&#x27;s belief that Muslims should first build up their social capital through advanced education before engaging in politics, but would later boldly tell the British Raj that Muslims must be considered a separate nation within India. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted a major influence on its policies and agendas. In 1913, Mohammed Ali Jinnah joined the Muslim league.

Intellectual support and a cadre of young activists emerged from Aligarh Muslim University. Historian Mushirul Hasan writes that in the early 20th century, this Muslim institution, designed to prepare students for service to the British Raj, exploded into political activity. Until 1939, the faculty and students supported an all-India nationalist movement. After 1939, however, sentiment shifted dramatically toward a Muslim separatist movement, as students and faculty mobilised behind Jinnah and the Muslim League.

===Growth of Communalism===
Politically, there was a degree of unity between Muslim and Hindu leaders after World War I, as typified by the Khilafat Movement. Relationships cooled sharply after that campaign ended in 1922. Communalism grew rapidly, forcing the two groups apart. Major riots broke out in numerous cities, including 91 between 1923 and 1927 in Uttar Pradesh alone. At the leadership level, the proportion of Muslims among delegates to the Congress party fell sharply, from 11% in 1921 to under 4% in 1923.

The two-state solution was rejected by the Congress leaders, who favoured a united India based on composite national identity. Congress at all times rejected &quot;communalism&quot; — that is, basing politics on religious identity. Iqbal&#x27;s policy of uniting the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, Punjab, and Sindh into a new Muslim majority state became part of the League&#x27;s political platform.

The League rejected the Committee report (the Nehru Report), arguing that it gave too little representation (only one quarter) to Muslims, established Devanagari as the official writing system of the colony, and demanded that India turn into a &quot;de facto&quot; unitary state, with residuary powers resting at the centre – the League had demanded at least one-third representation in the legislature and sizeable autonomy for the Muslim provinces. Jinnah reported a &quot;parting of the ways&quot; after his requests for minor amendments to the proposal were denied outright, and relations between the Congress and the League began to sour.

===Conception of Pakistan===
In November 1930, when all the prominent leaders of APML including Muhammad Ali Jinnah were invited by the British Prime Minister, Ramsay McDonalds for the round table conference, Muhammad Iqbal was invited to give the presidential address of APML in Allahabad in which nothing new was proposed. Some scholars argued that
&quot;Iqbal never pleaded for any kind of partition of the country. Rather he was an ardent proponent of a &#x27;true&#x27; federal setup for India..., and wanted a consolidated Muslim majority within the Indian Federation&quot;.

Another Indian historian, Tara Chand, also held that Iqbal was not thinking in terms of partition of India, but in terms of a federation of autonomous states within India. Dr. Safdar Mehmood also asserted in a series of articles that in the Allahabad address, Iqbal proposed a Muslim majority province within an Indian federation and not an independent state outside an Indian Federation.

On 28 January 1933, Choudhary Rahmat Ali, founder of the Pakistan National Movement, voiced his ideas in the pamphlet entitled &quot;Now or Never&quot;. In a subsequent book, he discussed the etymology in further detail: &quot;&#x27;Pakistan&#x27; is both a Persian and an Urdu word. It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our homelands ... That is, Panjab, Afghania (North-West Frontier Province), Kashmir, Iran, Sindh (including Kachch and Kathiawar), Tukharistan, Afghanistan, and Balochistan.&quot;

The British and the Indian press vehemently criticised these two different schemes and created confusion about the authorship of the word &quot;Pakistan&quot; to such an extent that even Jawaharlal Nehru had to write:
===Campaign for Pakistan===

Until 1937, the Muslim League had remained an organisation of elite Indian Muslims. The Muslim League leadership then began mass mobilisation and it then became a popular party with the Muslim masses in the 1940s, especially after the Lahore Resolution. Under Jinnah&#x27;s leadership, its membership grew to over two million and became more religious and even separatist in its outlook.

The Muslim League&#x27;s earliest base was the United Provinces, where they successfully mobilised the religious community in the late 1930s. Jinnah worked closely with local politicians, however, there was a lack of uniform political voice by the League during the 1938–1939 Madhe Sahaba riots in Lucknow. From 1937 onwards, the Muslim League and Jinnah attracted large crowds throughout India in its processions and strikes.

At a League conference in Lahore in 1940, Jinnah said:

In Lahore, the Muslim League formally recommitted itself to creating an independent Muslim state which would include Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, the North West Frontier Province, and Bengal, and which would be &quot;wholly autonomous and sovereign&quot;. The Lahore Resolution, moved by the sitting Chief Minister of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq, was adopted on 23 March 1940, and its principles formed the foundation for Pakistan&#x27;s first constitution. In the Indian provincial elections of 1946, the Muslim League won 425 out of 476 seats reserved for Muslims (and about 89.2% of Muslim votes) on a policy of creating the independent state of Pakistan, and with an implied threat of secession if this was not granted. Congress, led by Gandhi and Nehru, remained adamantly opposed to dividing India.

In opposition to the Lahore Resolution, the All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for a united India. Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates; the &quot;attendance at the Nationalist meeting was about five times than the attendance at the League meeting.&quot; The All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using &quot;intimidation and coercion&quot;. For example, Deobandi scholar Maulana Syed Husain Ahmad Madani travelled across British India, spreading the idea he wrote about in his book, &quot;Composite Nationalism and Islam&quot;, which stood for Hindu-Muslim unity and opposed the concept of a partition of India; while he was doing this, members of the pro-separatist Muslim League attacked Madani and disturbed his rallies. The murder of the All India Azad Muslim Conference leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro in 1943 further solidified the All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of Pakistan.

===Role in communal violence===
In the British Indian province of Sind, the historian Ayesha Jalal describes the actions that the pro-separatist Muslim League used in order to spread communal division and undermine the elected government of Allah Bakhsh Soomro, which stood for a united India:

Prior to this, in Sind, the All India Muslim League secured only 4.6% of the vote in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, in contrast to the winning Sind United Party, which stood for Hindu-Muslim unity. Twenty-seven out of thirty-four Muslim seats were won by the Sind United Party.

In the few years before the partition, the Muslim League was accused of &quot;monetarily subsidizing&quot; mobs that engaged in communal violence against Hindus and Sikhs in the areas of Multan, Rawalpindi, Campbellpur, Jhelum and Sargodha, as well as in the Hazara District. The Muslim League led mobs reportedly paid assassins money for every Hindu and Sikh killed. As such, leaders of the Muslim League, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, issued no condemnation of the violence against Hindus and Sikhs in Punjab.

==Legacy==

===Pakistan===
After the partition of the British Indian Empire, the Muslim League played a major role in giving birth to modern conservatism in Pakistan and the introduction of the democratic process in the country.

The Pakistani incarnation was originally led by the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and later by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, but suffered from ill-fate following the military intervention in 1958. One of its factions remained supportive of President Ayub Khan until 1962, when all factions decided to reform into the Pakistan Muslim League led by Nurul Amin, and to support Fatima Jinnah in the presidential elections in 1965. Furthermore, it was the only party to have received votes from both East and West Pakistan during the elections held in 1970. During the successive periods of Pakistan, the Pakistan Muslim League went on to be one of the ruling parties holding alternating power within the nation.

===India===
After the partition of India in 1947, the All-India Muslim League was disbanded. It was succeeded by Indian Union Muslim League in the new India.

Indian Union Muslim League contests Indian General Elections under the Indian Constitution. The party has always had a constant, if small presence, in the Indian Parliament. The party has had two members in every Lower House from the third to the 16th House, with the exception of the Second, in which it had no members, and the fourth, in which it had three members. The party had a single member in the 14th Lower House. The party currently has four members in Parliament. The party is currently a part of the United Progressive Alliance in national level.

Indian Union Muslim League is recognised by the Election Commission of India as a State Party in Kerala.The party is a major member of the opposition United Democratic Front, the Indian National Congress-lead pre-poll state-level alliance in Kerala. Whenever the United Democratic Front rules in Kerala, the party leaders are chosen as important Cabinet Ministers.

===Bangladesh===

The Muslim League formed its government in East Bengal immediately after the partition of Bengal, with Khawaja Nazimuddin becoming the first Chief Minister.

Problems in East Pakistan for the Muslim League began to rise following the issue of the Constitution of Pakistan. Furthermore, the Bengali Language Movement proved to be the last event that led the Muslim League to lose its mandate in East Bengal. The Muslim League&#x27;s national conservatism program also faced several setbacks and resistance from the Communist Party of Pakistan. In an interview given to print media, Nurul Amin stated that the communists had played an integral and major role in staging the massive protests, mass demonstrations, and strikes for the Bengali Language Movement.

All over the country, the political parties had favoured the general elections in Pakistan with the exception of the Muslim League. In 1954, legislative elections were to be held for the Parliament. Unlike in West Punjab, not all of the Hindu population migrated to India, instead a large number stayed in the state. The influence of the Communist Party deepened, and its goal of attaining power was finally realised during the elections. The United Front, the Communist Party, and the Awami League returned to power, inflicting a severe defeat to the Muslim League. Out of 309, the Muslim League only won 10 seats, whereas the Communist Party got 4 seats of the ten contested. The communists working with other parties had secured 22 additional seats, totalling 26. The right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami had completely failed in the elections.

In 1955, the United Front named Abu Hussain Sarkar as the Chief Minister of the State and he ruled the state in two non-consecutive terms until 1958, when martial law was imposed. The Muslim League remained as a minor party in East Pakistan but participated with full rigour during the Pakistan general elections in 1970. It won 10 seats from East Pakistan and 7 seats from other parts of Pakistan. After the independence of Bangladesh, the Muslim League was revived in 1976 but its size was reduced, rendering it insignificant in the political arena.

===United Kingdom===

During the 1940s, the Muslim League had a United Kingdom chapter active in the British politics. After the establishment of Pakistan, the Pakistani community&#x27;s leaders took over the UK branch, choosing Zubeida Habib Rahimtoola as president of the party to continue to serve its purpose in the United Kingdom. At present, the Muslim League&#x27;s UK branch is led by the PML-N, with Zubair Gull as its president.

<text>Rampur ( ; ISO: &quot;Rāmapura&quot;; formerly Mustafabad) is a town and the municipality headquarter of Rampur District in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It was formerly known for its various industries, like sugar refining and cotton milling. Its library has more than 12,000 rare manuscripts and a fine collection of Mughal miniature paintings. It is located 322 kilometres north-west of the state capital Lucknow &amp; approx 180 kilometres from the national capital New Delhi.

In 2007, the Ministry of Minority Affairs identified Rampur District as one of 14 &#x27;Minority Concentration&#x27; districts in the state, on the basis of the 2001 census data on population, socio-economic indicators and basic amenities indicators. The city is known for its Rampuri chaaku (knife).

== Etymology ==
Originally it was a group of four villages named Kather, the name of Raja Ram Singh. The first Nawab proposed to rename the city &quot;Faizabad&quot;. But many other places were known by the name Faizabad so its name was changed to Mustafabad alias Rampur.

== History ==

As per medieval history, Rampur was the part of the Delhi region, and was divided between Badaun and Sambhal districts. Being situated on upperside of Rohilkhand, it was known by the name Kather and was ruled by Katheria Rajputs. The Katheria Rajputs resisted external for about 400 years, fighting the sultans of Delhi and later with the Mughals. They went to repeated battles with Nasiruddin Mahmud in 1253, Ghiyas ud din Balban in 1256, Jalal-ud-din Khalji in 1290, Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1379 &amp; Sikandar Lodi in 1494.

Later, in the beginning of the Mughal period, the capital of Rohilkhand was changed from Badaun to Bareilly and hence the importance of Rampur increased.

The Rohilla War of 1774–5 began when the Rohilla Pathans - dominant in the area - reneged on a debt they owed the Nawab of Oudh for military assistance against the Marathas in 1772. The Rohilla were defeated and driven from their former capital of Bareilly by the Nawab with the assistance of the East India Company&#x27;s troops lent by Warren Hastings.

The Rohilla State of Rampur was established by Nawab Faizullah Khan on 7 October 1774 in the presence of British Commander Colonel Champion, and remained a pliant state under British protection thereafter.

Khan laid the first stone of the new fort at Rampur and thus Rampur city was founded in 1775. Originally it was a group of four villages named Kather, the name of Raja Ram Singh. The first Nawab proposed to rename the city &#x27;Faizabad&#x27;. But many other places were known by the name of Faizabad already existed, so the name was changed to Mustafabad alias Rampur. Nawwab Faizullah Khan ruled for 20 years. He was a great patron of scholarship, and began the collection of Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Urdu manuscripts which now make up the bulk of the Rampur Raza Library. After his death his son Muhammad Ali Khan took over, but he was killed by the Rohilla leaders after 24 days, and Ghulam Muhammad Khan, the brother of the deceased, was proclaimed Nawab. The East India Company took exception to this, and after a reign of just 3 months and 22 days Ghulam Muhammad Khan was defeated by its forces. The Governor-General made Ahmad Ali Khan, son of the late Muhammad Ali Khan, the new Nawab. He ruled for 44 years. He did not have any sons, so Muhammad Sa&#x27;id Khan, son of Ghulam Muhammad Khan, took over as the new Nawab. He raised a regular Army, established Courts and carried out many works to improve the economic conditions of farmers. His son Muhammad Yusuf Ali Khan took over after his death. His son Kalb Ali Khan became the new Nawab in 1865.


Nawab Kalb Ali Khan was literate in Arabic and Persian. Under his rule, the state did much work to uplift standards of education. He was also a Member of Council during the Viceroyalty of Lord John Lawrence. He built the Jama Masjid in Rampur at a cost of Rs. 300,000. He was also knighted in Agra by the Prince of Wales. He ruled for 22 years and 7 months. After his death his son Mushtaq Ali Khan took over. He appointed W. C. Wright as the Chief Engineer of the state and built many new buildings and canals. Nawab Hamid Ali became the new ruler in 1889 at the age of 14. Many new schools were opened during his reign, and many donations were provided to nearby colleges. He donated Rs. 50,000 to Lucknow Medical College. In 1905 he built the magnificent Darbar Hall within the Fort which now houses the great collection of Oriental manuscripts held by the Rampur Raza Library. His son Raza Ali Khan became the last ruling Nawab in 1930.

On 1 July 1949 the State of Rampur was merged into the Republic of India. Rampur today presents a slightly decayed appearance: the palaces of the Nawabs are crumbling, as are the gates and walls of the fort. However, the Library remains a flourishing institution of immense value to scholars from all over the world.

The Nawabs of Rampur sided with the British during Indian Rebellion of 1857, and this enabled them to continue to play a role in the social, political and cultural life of Northern India in general and the Muslims of the United Provinces in particular. They gave refuge to some of the literary figures from the Court of Bahadur Shah &quot;Zafar&quot;.

===Post-independence===
Descendants of the Nawabs include Murad Mian the first child of Murtaza Ali Khan of Rampur. Begum Noor Bano, the widow of the former Nawab&#x27;s younger brother and ex-MP Zulfiquar Ali Khan of Rampur. Begum Noor Bano has become a politician and won the election from Rampur parliamentary constituency in 1999. She lost the elections in 2004,2009 from Rampur and 2014 from Moradabad consecutively. Murtaza Ali Khan and Zulfiquar Ali Khan (aka Mikki Mia), who continued to use the title of Nawab as a token even after independence and abolition of royalty but never ruled Rampur, are now dead. Murtaza Ali contested an election from Rampur opposite his mother Rafat Jamani Begum in 1972 and won. Although the two brothers were always political rivals they never faced each other in elections. Subsequently, the family was also involved in smuggling scandals involving some smuggling from Pakistan, where one of the sons of Murtaza Ali is married. Raza Inter College, Hamid Inter College and Murtaza Inter College are three higher secondary schools named after three nawabs.

The present Nawab of Rampur, Muhammad Murad Ali Khan Bahadur is the present titular Nawab of Rampur. The eldest son of Murtuza Ali Khan Bahadur, he succeeded his father as titular Nawab upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1982. He served as a member on the Raza Library Board in Rampur from 1993 to 2002.

<text>Mandy Kane is a singer, songwriter, producer and remixer. He is best known for his single &quot;Stab&quot; which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA charts in 2004.

==Career==
===1990s–2002: Early years===
Mandy Kane started playing in high school rock bands and worked in part-time jobs to save money to buy a 4-track recorder. He says his songs are inspired by a variety of rock icons from bygone eras – from David Bowie and Gary Numan to The Beatles and Pink Floyd. 

Seeking other outlets to develop his musical and theatrical sensibilities, he joined local drama groups and rallied locals to play in his band. After he had produced a number of songs with his basic home recording setup, Kane started sending out demos to record companies and managers. 

Michael Newton of Roundhouse Entertainment can be credited with discovering Kane and taking on a management role in the early stages of his career. Newton&#x27;s involvement resulted in a publishing deal with Mushroom Music after Michael Gudinski attended one of Kane&#x27;s showcases at Revolver Upstairs. Kane was eventually signed by Warner Music Australasia.

===2003–2005: &quot;Tragic Daydreams&quot;===
Mandy Kane relocated to Los Angeles to work with producers Chris Vrenna and Joe Chiccarelli. Tony Espie was commissions to mix Kane&#x27;s recordings, which were then mastered at The Exchange in London. 

Mandy Kane&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Stab&quot; was released in July 2003. The single is both a statement against teen suicide and a reference to the &#x27;stabbing&#x27; Numanesque synths featured throughout. &quot;Stab&quot; peaked at number 18 in the ARIA charts. &quot;Billy Bones&quot; was released as the second single in October 2003, reaching number 27 in the ARIA charts. Billy Bones is a fictitious character, vaguely based on Kane&#x27;s experimentation with home recording equipment as a teenager. A third single titled &quot;Stupid Friday&quot; was released in March 2004 and peaked at number 36 in the ARIA charts. Mandy Kane&#x27;s debut album &quot;Tragic Daydreams&quot; was released in April 2004 and peaked at number 79 on the ARIA Charts.

To promote the album, Kane toured extensively with the original line-up expanded to include Zakk Zedras (Roxus, Serpentine, Red Circle &amp; Rie Nakayama. Kane played a showcase gig at the Australian premiere of the Matrix Revolutions before an audience including Keanu Reeves. This line-up also toured with Marilyn Manson.

Mandy Kane&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Ordinary World&quot; by Duran Duran features on the soundtrack to the Australian movie &quot;One Perfect Day.&quot;

===2006–present: Independent releases=== 
In 2006, Mandy Kane formed his own independent label, &quot;Mummy&#x27;s Boy Records&quot; (which would later be renamed &quot;The Majestika Creative&quot;), through which he released his first independent single, &quot;(UK) Hanky Panky&quot; as a digital download. It features on the EP, &quot;Murder in the Daylight&quot;, which was released in April 2006.

Mandy Kane commissioned the then fledgling band Van She to remix the title track from the EP as its second single. The track received an Honourable Mention in the Billboard Song Contest. 

In May 2008, Mandy Kane released the stand-alone digital single &quot;Far From Oblivion&quot;. He also recorded an acoustic version to include as a B-side.

In 2009 Mandy Kane released the single &quot;25 Seconds&quot;. Gary Numan and his producer Ade Fenton were commissioned to remix the song. This remix received considerable rotation on radio and at clubs in Australia and abroad, with Numan himself praising Kane for his songwriting ability.

In November 2015, Mandy Kane released the EP &quot;Darkness &amp; Divine&quot; as well as a re-recording of his debut studio titled &quot;Tragic Daydreams Reimagined&quot;.

In December 2023, Mandy Kane released the mini-album &quot;Runestones &amp; Keymasters (An Oratorio)&quot;, combining mysticism and folklore with vintage rock tones, orchestral arrangements, and well refined song-craft.

==Artist development, production and management==
In addition to continuing to produce and release his own material, Mandy Kane has worked as a producer and manager for several other artists. 

Mandy Kane worked with Nathaniel Willemse, during which time he co-wrote and produced several songs which resulted in the release of a debut EP for the artist titled &quot;Vertigo&quot;. The title track, a cover of the popular U2 single, was marketed as part of a Video Hits competition which gave the release four weeks of consecutive rotation on commercial television in Australia.

From 2009–2012, Kane assisted in developing and co-managed Australian act Dancing Heals. He mixed their debut EP &quot;Out of This&quot; and produced their debut album &quot;Into the Night&quot;, which was recorded at Red Door Sounds. 

Kane accompanied the band on a tour of North America in 2010, which saw the band play to sold out venues as well as establishing international fans and industry contacts. The album was well received by reviewers and the public alike, with the single &quot;Diamonds&quot; enjoying five weeks of repeated rotation on Australia&#x27;s prime music video television program &quot;Rage&quot;. International audiences also responded favourably, with &quot;Into the Night&quot; debuting in the Top 20 specialty radio charts in the US.

<text>Nawab is a royal title indicating a ruler, often of a South Asian state, in many ways comparable to the Western title of Prince. The relationship of a Nawab to the Emperor of India has been compared to that of the Kings of Saxony to the German Emperor. In earlier times the title was ratified and bestowed by the reigning Mughal emperor to semi-autonomous Muslim rulers of subdivisions or princely states in the Indian subcontinent loyal to the Mughal Empire, for example the Nawabs of Bengal.

&quot;Nawab&quot; usually refers to males and literally means &quot;Viceroy&quot;; the female equivalent is &quot;Begum&quot; or &quot;Nawab Begum&quot;. The primary duty of a Nawab was to uphold the sovereignty of the Mughal emperor along with the administration of a certain province.

The title of &quot;nawabi&quot; was also awarded as a personal distinction by the paramount power, similar to a British peerage, to persons and families who ruled a princely state for various services to the Government of India. In some cases, the titles were also accompanied by jagir grants, either in cash revenues and allowances or land-holdings. During the British Raj, some of the chiefs, or sardars, of large or important tribes were also given the title, in addition to traditional titles already held by virtue of chieftainship.

The term &quot;Zamindari&quot; was originally used for the &quot;subahdar&quot; (provincial governor) or viceroy of a &quot;subah&quot; (province) or regions of the Mughal Empire.

==History==

Nawab was a Hindustani term, used in Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Pashto and many other North-Indian languages, borrowed via Persian from the Arabic honorific plural of &quot;naib&quot;, or &quot;deputy.&quot; In some areas, especially Bengal, the term is pronounced &quot;nobab&quot;. This later variation has also entered English and other foreign languages as nabob. 

The Subahdar was the head of the Mughal provincial administration. He was assisted by the provincial &quot;Diwan&quot;, &quot;Bakhshi&quot;, &quot;Faujdar&quot;, &quot;Kotwal&quot;, &quot;Qazi&quot;, &quot;Sadr&quot;, &quot;Waqa-i-Navis&quot;, &quot;Qanungo&quot; and &quot;Patwari&quot;. As the Mughal empire began to dissolve in the early 18th century, many &quot;subahs&quot; became effectively independent. The term &quot;nawaab&quot; is often used to refer to any Muslim ruler in north or south India while the term &quot;nizam&quot; is preferred for a senior official; it literally means &quot;governor of region&quot;. The Nizam of Hyderabad had several nawabs under him: Nawabs of Cuddapah, Sira, Rajahmundry, Kurnool, Chicacole, et al. &quot;Nizam&quot; was his personal title, awarded by the Mughal Government and based on the term &quot;nazim&quot; as meaning &quot;senior officer&quot;. &quot;Nazim&quot; is still used for a district collector in many parts of India. The term &quot;nawab&quot; is still technically imprecise, as the title was also awarded to Hindus and Sikhs, as well, and large zamindars and not necessarily to all Muslim rulers. With the decline of that empire, the title, and the powers that went with it, became hereditary in the ruling families in the various provinces.

Under later British rule, nawabs continued to rule various princely states of Amb, Bahawalpur, Balasinor, Baoni, Banganapalle, Bhopal, Cambay, Jaora, Junagadh, Kurnool (the main city of Deccan), Kurwai, Mamdot, Multan, Palanpur, Pataudi, Radhanpur, Rampur, Malerkotla, Sachin, and Tonk. Other former rulers bearing the title, such as the nawabs of Bengal and Awadh, had been deprived by the British or others by the time the Mughal dynasty finally ended in 1857.
Some princes became nawab by promotion. For example, the ruler of Palanpur was &quot;diwan&quot; until 1910, then &quot;nawab sahib&quot;. Other nawabs were promoted are restyled to another princely style, or to and back, such as in Rajgarh a single rawat (rajah) went by nawab. 

The style for a nawab&#x27;s wife is &quot;begum&quot;. Most of the nawab dynasties were male primogenitures, although several ruling Begums of Bhopal were a notable exception.

Before the incorporation of the Subcontinent into the British Empire, nawabs ruled the kingdoms of Awadh (or Oudh, encouraged by the British to shed the Mughal suzerainty and assume the imperial style of Badshah), Bengal, Arcot and Bhopal.

== Miscellaneous nawabs ==

=== Personal nawabs ===

The title &quot;nawab&quot; was also awarded as a personal distinction by the paramount power, similarly to a British peerage, to persons and families who never ruled a princely state. For the Muslim elite various Mughal-type titles were introduced, including nawab. Among the noted British creations of this type were Nawab Hashim Ali Khan (1858–1940), Nawab Khwaja Abdul Ghani (1813–1896), Nawab Abdul Latif (1828–1893), Nawab Faizunnesa Choudhurani (1834–1904), Nawab Ali Chowdhury (1863–1929), Nawaab Syed Shamsul Huda (1862–1922), Nawab Sirajul Islam (1848–1923), Nawab Alam yar jung Bahadur, M.A, Madras, B.A., B.C.L., Barr-At-Law (1890–1974). There also were the Nawabs of Dhanbari, Nawabs of Ratanpur, Nawabs of Baroda and such others.

===Nawab as a court rank===
&quot;Nawab&quot; was also the rank title—again not an office—of a much lower class of Muslim nobles—in fact retainers—at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar State, ranking only above Khan Bahadur and Khan, but under (in ascending order) Jang, Daula, Mulk, Umara and Jah; the equivalent for Hindu courtiers was Raja Bahadur.

==Related titles==
===Nawabzada===
This style, adding the Persian suffix &quot;-zada&quot; which means son (or other male descendants; see other cases in prince), etymologically fits a nawab’s sons, but in actual practice various dynasties established other customs.

For example, in Bahawalpur only the nawbab&#x27;s heir apparent used &quot;nawabzada&quot; before his personal name, then &quot;Khan Abassi&quot;, finally &quot;Wali Ahad Bahadur&quot; (an enhancement of Wali Ehed), while the other sons of the ruling nawab used the style sahibzada before the personal name and only Khan Abassi behind. &quot;Nawabzadi&quot; implies daughters of the reigning nawbab.

Elsewhere, there were rulers who were not styled nawbab yet awarded a title nawabzada to others.

===Naib (Ottoman, Iranian, Arabic title)===
The word &quot;naib&quot; () has been historically used to refer to any suzerain leader, feudatory, or regent in some parts of the Ottoman Empire, successive early modern Persianate kingdoms (Safavids, etc.), and in the eastern Caucasus (e.g. during Caucasian Imamate). In the Sultanate of Morocco, the Naib was the Sultan&#x27;s emissary to the foreign legations in Tangier between 1848 and 1923, when the creation of the Tangier International Zone led to its replacement by the office of the Mendoub. 

Today, the word is used to refer to directly elected legislators in lower houses of parliament in many Arabic-speaking areas to contrast them against officers of upper houses (or Shura). The term Majlis al-Nuwwab (, literally &quot;council of deputies&quot;) has been adopted as the name of several legislative lower houses and unicameral legislatures.

&quot;Naib&quot; has also been used in the Malay language (especially of the Malaysian variant) to translate the component of &quot;deputy&quot; or &quot;vice&quot; in certain titles (e.g &quot;Vice President&quot; - &quot;Naib Presiden&quot;) aside from &quot;timbalan&quot; and &quot;wakil&quot; (latter predominant in the Indonesian variant).

==&quot;Nabob&quot;, derived colloquial term==
In colloquial usage in English (since 1612), adopted in other Western languages, the transliteration &quot;nabob&quot; refers to commoners: a merchant-leader of high social status and wealth. &quot;Nabob&quot; derives from the Bengali pronunciation of &quot;nawab&quot;: &quot;nôbab&quot;.

During the 18th century in particular, it was widely used as a disparaging term for British merchants or administrators who, having made a fortune in India, returned to Britain and aspired to be recognised as having the higher social status that their new wealth would enable them to maintain. Jos Sedley in Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is probably the best known example in fiction.

From this specific usage it came to be sometimes used for ostentatiously rich businesspeople in general.

&quot;Nabob&quot; can also be used metaphorically for people who have a grandiose sense of their own importance, as in the famous alliterative dismissal of the news media as &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism&quot; in a speech that was delivered by Nixon&#x27;s vice president Spiro Agnew and written by William Safire.

<text>James Wilson (27 September 1922 – 6 August 2005) was an Irish composer. Though born in England, Wilson was a resident of Ireland for over 50 years.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Islington, London. His father, a chemist, died when James was only four days old, leaving his widowed mother to bring up three sons alone. Without any family background in music (the only real interest was his mother&#x27;s slight interest in playing the piano), Wilson began piano lessons in 1931 (at the age of nine), continuing them until 1938. While in his early teens, Wilson attended many operas which fostered his interest in music.

After school, and without any formal higher education, Wilson entered the Civil Service after having passed their entrance exam. He served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, from 1942 till 1946. Having finished his military service, Wilson began attending weekly musical composition classes at the Trinity College of Music in London. It was around this time that he left the Civil Service to pursue a full-time career in music. In 1948 he moved to Ireland, where he had been stationed in the latter part of his naval service.

==Musical work==
Wilson was a largely self-taught composer. He experimented with many musical styles but did not particularly adhere to any of them. He had an interest in some less typical instruments, and wrote substantial works for the free-bass accordion, the cor anglais, and an electrically modified flute.

Wilson&#x27;s creative output was large and varied: seven operas, three symphonies, twelve concertos, several ballets, about two hundred songs, and a large number of other choral and instrumental works. His works have been performed and broadcast throughout Ireland, the UK, and Scandinavia.

Wilson was professor of composition at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. For many years he was also the course director of the annual Ennis/IMRO Composition Summer School. Wilson was a founder-member of Aosdána, an association of people in Ireland who have achieved distinction in the arts.

In 1999 Wilson became an Irish citizen. He died just six years later in Dublin, on 6 August 2005. He was working on an eighth opera at the time of his death.

==Selected works==
Opera
*&quot;Grinning at the Devil&quot;
*&quot;Letters to Theo&quot;

*&quot;Twelfth Night&quot;

Concerti
*&quot;For Sarajevo, Calico Pie&quot; (triple concerto)
*&quot;Concerto Giocoso&quot;

==Quotations==
*&quot;Music is the nearest thing that we know to magic: its powers have still to be understood.&quot; 
*&quot;In my own work, I seek for clarity and economy and, above all, for the quality of lyricism.&quot;

<doc id="517328" wikidata="Q746063" url="?curid=517328" title="Villa d'Este">
<text>The Villa d&#x27;Este is a 16th-century villa in Tivoli, near Rome. It is a masterpiece of Italian architecture and garden design, famous for its terraced hillside Italian Renaissance garden and the ingenuity of its architectural features (fountains, ornamental basins, ceilings, etc.), it is an incomparable example of a 16th-century Italian garden, which later had a huge influence on landscape design in Europe. It is now an Italian state museum, and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==

The Villa was commissioned by Cardinal Ippolito II d&#x27;Este (1509–1572), second son of Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, the Duke of Ferrara and grandson of Pope Alexander VI through his mother Lucrezia Borgia. The Este family had been lords of Ferrara since 1393, and were famous as patrons of the arts and of the humanist scholars of the Renaissance. As a second son, Ippolito was destined for a career in the church; he was named archbishop of Milan when he was only ten years old. At the age of 27, he was sent to the French court, where he became an advisor to the French King, Francis I, and in 1540 became a member of the King&#x27;s Private Council. At the age of thirty, at the request of the King, Pope Paul III made d&#x27;Este a cardinal. Thanks to his ecclesiastical and royal connections, he became one of the wealthiest cardinals of the time, with an annual income estimated at 120,000 &quot;scudi&quot;. He was a lavish patron of the arts, supporting among others the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, the musician Pierluigi da Palestrina and the poet Torquato Tasso. While his income was enormous, he was always in debt. The new French King, Henry II, sent him as an envoy to Rome, where he played a major role in the social and political life of the city. He appeared destined to become Pope and used all of his money and influence toward that goal, but at the time of the Reformation and the Council of Trent, his extravagant style of life worked against him. His first candidacy for the papal position, in 1549, with the support of the French King, was blocked by the Habsburg Emperor. D&#x27;Este promptly withdrew his own candidacy, endorsed the Habsburg candidate, and was rewarded by the College of Cardinals on December 3, 1549, with the lifetime position of Governor of Tivoli. This new title suited d&#x27;Este, because he was already a passionate collector of antiquities, and it gave him jurisdiction over the site of Hadrian&#x27;s villa and other sites just being excavated. He did not give up his ambition to become Pope. He was five times a candidate for Pope, but was never selected.

Tivoli had been a popular summer residence since ancient Roman times due to its altitude, cooler temperatures and its proximity to the Villa Hadriana, the summer residence of the Emperor Hadrian I. The position of Governor of Tivoli came with an official residence located in a former convent of the Benedictine order, which had been built in the 9th century on the site of an old Roman villa. In 1256 it had been donated to the Franciscan order. The residence was not large enough for the enormous household of a Cardinal as prominent as d&#x27;Este, but it did have an extensive view of the countryside below, including Hadrian&#x27;s villa, and an abundant natural water supply for fountains and gardens. D&#x27;Este commissioned a prominent classical scholar, Pirro Ligorio, who had studied the Villa Hadriana and other Roman sites in the vicinity, to plan a new villa and garden which would exceed anything the Romans had built. He obtained an abundant supply of marble and statuary from the ruins of Hadrian&#x27;s villa.

The land was acquired and construction was planned to begin at the end of 1550, but the Cardinal was distracted by various diplomatic missions; he was posted to northern Italy to resolve a war in Parma, then sent by Henry II on a mission to Sienna. He did not return to Tivoli until the summer of 1555. In September 1555, however, he was accused of simony by Pope Paul IV and exiled. The Pope died in 1559, and the new pontiff, Pope Pius IV, rehabilitated d&#x27;Este and restored his title as governor of Tivoli. Construction began when he returned in July 1560. More land was needed and acquired through 1569. The vast construction site required the demolition of houses, public buildings and roads. In 1568 the local residents filed twelve different lawsuits against the Cardinal, but did not deter him from his project. Between 1563 and 1565, a huge amount of earth was excavated and used to construct new terraces; arcades, grottos, niches, and nymphaeums. The nearby river Aniene was diverted to furnish water for the complex system of pools, water jets, channels, fountains, cascades and water games. The steep slope of the garden, more than from top to bottom, posed special challenges. Canals were dug and of underground pipes were laid to carry the water from the artificial mountain under the oval fountain to the rest of the garden. Following the aesthetic principles of the Renaissance, the garden was carefully divided into regular units, or compartments, each across, laid out along a longitudinal median axis, with five lateral axes.

The plans for the villa itself were carried out under the direction of the Ferrarese architect-engineer Alberto Galvani, court architect of the Este. The chief painter of the ambitious internal decoration was Livio Agresti from Forlì. In 1565 and 1566, work began on the decoration of the interior of the villa. The decoration was carried out by a team of painters under Girolamo Muziano and Federico Zuccari. In 1566, the Cardinal made his fifth effort to be elected Pope, but once again he was defeated, and he was excluded by the new pontiff, Pope Pius V, from any more official appointments. He turned more and more of his attention to the decoration of his villa. New teams of painters and stucco workers labored on the task between 1567 and 1572, under the direction of Girolamo Muziano, Livio Agresti, Cesare Nebbia, Durante Alberti, Metteo Neroni, and Federico Zuccari. The painters were joined by sculptors Giovan Battista della Porta. Pirrino del Galgliardo, Gillis van den Vliete, Giovanni Malanca, and Pierre de la Motte. They were joined by ceramists and mosaic artists, as well as fountain engineers, led by Pirro Ligorio, the original designer of the project, who returned to finish the work in 1567–68.

The frantic work on the project began to slow in 1569, probably due to the financial difficulties of the Cardinal, who had no more hope of being elected Pope and had lost his lucrative French positions. He spent more and more of his time in the villa, reading and meeting with the leading poets, artists and philosophers of the Renaissance. In the summer of 1572, he entertained one last important guest, Pope Gregory XIII. To prepare for the visit, the Cardinal redecorated the top floors of the villa and rushed completion of the dragon fountain. The reception for the Pope cost him more than five thousand &quot;scudi&quot; forcing him to pawn his silver and other precious objects. Soon after the reception, on December 2, 1572, the Cardinal died in Rome, and was buried in a simple tomb in the church adjoining the Villa.

===In later years===

With the death of Ippolito in 1572, the villa and gardens passed to his nephew, Cardinal Luigi (1538–1586), who continued work on some of the unfinished fountains and gardens, but struggled with high maintenance costs. After his death in 1586, the villa was owned by the Cardinal Deacons of the Sacred College, who did little to maintain it. In 1599 it returned to the Este family with the nomination of Cardinal Alessandro d&#x27;Este (1538–1624). Alessandro had the energy and ambition of his ancestor and carried out a major renovation of the gardens and water systems, as well as building a new system of fountains in the lower garden. He also persuaded Pope Gregory XV to formally grant ownership of the villa to the Este family. His successors, the Dukes of Modena, made further additions to the gardens. Francesco I (1629–1641) restored many of the crumbling structures and began planting trees in the previously unshaded gardens. Cardinal Rinaldo I commissioned two new fountains by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1660–61. However, after 1695, the Este family was unable to support the high cost of maintaining the villa, which they rarely used and which produced no income. The villa went into a long decline. After 1751, the furnishings were sent to Modena, and the antique sculpture was gradually removed from the gardens and sold to collectors. In 1796, the House of Habsburg took possession of the villa, after Ercole III d&#x27;Este bequeathed it to his daughter Maria Beatrice, married to Grand Duke Ferdinand of Habsburg. It was largely neglected and was twice occupied by French soldiers, who took away much of the decoration that remained.

Between 1850 and 1896, the villa was owned by Cardinal Gustav von Hohenlohe, who restored the dilapidated villa and the ruined and overgrown gardens, which now appealed to the romantic sentiments of the period. The villa once again attracted artists, musicians and writers. The composer Franz Liszt made several visits between 1865 and 1885, and wrote three pieces of piano music, two musical &quot;threnodies&quot; with the title &quot;Aux cyprès de la Villa d&#x27;Este&quot; and the character piece &quot;Les jeux d&#x27;eau à la Villa d&#x27;Este,&quot; that depict the grounds. They were placed in the &quot;third year&quot; of his Années de pèlerinage. The latter includes some of the most influential evocations of the play of water ever written for piano.

After the First World War, the villa was acquired by the Italian State, which began a major restoration in 1922. The villa was refurnished with paintings from the storerooms of the Galleria Nazionale, Rome. It suffered bomb damage in 1944 during World War II, and many of the walls were degraded in postwar years by environmental pollution, but campaigns of restoration and protection have preserved intact the famous features of the villa and gardens. Jean Garrigue&#x27;s volume of poems &quot;A Water Walk by Villa d&#x27;Este&quot; (1959) was inspired by the gardens. Kenneth Anger filmed &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot; among the water features of the garden. The water organ, which had not functioned for many years, was restored and now plays again each day for visitors.

==Villa==
Today the villa is entered from a doorway on the Piazza Trento, next to the entrance of the Church of Santa-Maria Maggiore. In the time of Ippolito d&#x27;Este, this entrance was rarely used; visitors arrived at the bottom of the gardens, and ascended, step by step, to the villa, viewing the fountains and statuary. The current door dates to 1521, to the period before Ippolito. The foyer inside the door has a painted vault which was once covered with paintings, which were largely destroyed by the bombing during World War II.
It was decorated with monochrome scenes from the Old Testament, a few of which, including The Sacrifice of Isaac, still can be seen. They date to the period between 1563 and 1565, and were probably designed by Girolamo Muziano. The next room, the Hall of the Stories of Solomon, shows scenes from life of King Solomon, set in frames painted to resemble marble. They also are attributed to Muziano and his craftsmen, also from about 1565. A massive head of travertine stone is on display here, which until the 18th century was in the garden.

The Courtyard is placed where the original cloister of the convent was located. It was constructed in 1566–67, and is surrounded by a gallery. The centrepiece of the courtyard is the Fountain of Venus, the only fountain in the Villa which retains its original appearance and decoration. The fountain, designed by Raffaelo Sangallo in 1568–69, is framed by two doric columns, and crowned by a 4th-century marble bust of the Emperor Constantine. The central element of the fountain is a Roman statue of a sleeping Venus, made in the 4th or 5th centuries A.D. Water originally poured from a vase beside her into a Roman labrum of white marble (2nd century AD) decorated with two lion heads. The fountain is surrounded on three sides by a sixteenth-century courtyard sited on the former Benedictine cloister. The fountain on a side wall contains a grotto and a figure which follows a Hellenistic prototype most familiar in the &quot;Sleeping Ariadne&quot; of the Vatican. The grotto, epitomized by the high-relief stalactites, identifies her as the resident nymph, or &quot;genius loci&quot;, though guidebooks sometimes call her a &quot;Venus&quot;. The base of the fountain is decorated with a stucco bas relief which was once gilded, and portrays the white heraldic eagles of the D&#x27;Este. It illustrates the course of the river flowing from Mount Sant&#x27;Angelo to the Villa. The sculptural decoration around the courtyard, particularly the representation of quince trees, illustrates the 11th labor of Hercules; the theft of golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides, where they were guarded by the dragon Ladone. Hercules was reputed to be a protector of the Tiburtine region where the villa is located, and also was claimed as an ancestor of the d&#x27;Este family.

===Apartments of the Cardinal===

The Salon on the ground floor is the first room of the personal apartments of Ippolito; it was used for receptions, and features an extensive view of the garden below and countryside beyond, including Villa of Hadrian. The walls, bare today, were covered with leather decorated with gold and green designs and the eagles of the d&#x27;Este family. The vaulted ceiling of the room is still covered with a frieze and frescoes on the theme of virtue, painted in twenty different personifications. These were designed by Livio Agresti in 1568, and created by a team of artists. and stucco-makers. Other themes include landscapes with ruined temples, inspired by the Tiburtine countryside.

A small antechamber next to the salon has a frieze and vault is decorated with more personifications of virtue, and leads to the Cardinal&#x27;s Bedroom, which was constructed in 1576. The bedroom walls were originally covered with leather painted with gold and silver. The coffered wooden ceiling is the most notable feature of the room, gilded and painted with the Este crest. an eagle surrounded by quince branches, a bishop&#x27;s hat and the motto of the Este family, &quot;ab insomni non custodita dracone&quot;, a verse from Ovid referring to the dragon guarding the gardens of the Hesperides. Feminine figures representing different aspects of virtue occupy the corners of the room. The private apartment is completed by a library and by a small chapel, whose walls are decorated with frescoes of mixture of classical and Christian symbolism, Sibyls and of prophets, and whose ceiling vault features a fresco of the coronation of the Virgin Mary. The apartment also connects by doorways with Pirro Ligorio&#x27;s classical Gran Loggia on the garden facade of the house, based on the terrace below and designed in the form of a great triumphal arch.

===Lower floor===

The floor below the Cardinal&#x27;s personal apartments contains a series of highly decorated rooms, each decorated with a specific theme, all connected to nature, mythology, and water. The rooms are less formal than those of the apartment above; they were used for private moments in the life of the Cardinal; listening to music or poetry; conversation, reading, and religious reflection. They are reached by a large ceremonial stairway that descends from the courtyard, and are connected to each other by a long narrow corridor with a high vaulted ceiling, which receives light from a series of openings to the courtyard above. The ceiling of the corridor is decorated with mosaics from the late 16th century, representing a pergola inhabited by colorful birds, making the corridor seem a part of the garden. The corridor also features three elaborate rustic fountains, containing miniature grottos framed with columns and pediments.

The Hall of Noah, like the other rooms on the floor, has walls covered with frescoes designed to resemble tapestries, intertwined with scenes of classical landscapes, ruins, rustic farm houses, and other scenes covering inch of the ceiling and walls, This room is dated to 1571, at the end of the decoration of the villa, and is attributed to Girolamo Muziano, who was famous for similar scenes of Venetian landscapes. The major scenes portrayed are the Four Seasons, allegories of prudence and temperance, and the central scene of Noah with the ark shortly after its landing on Mount Ararat, making an agreement with God. A white eagle, the symbol of the d&#x27;Este, is prominently shown landing from the Ark.

The next room, the Hall of Moses, features a fresco in the center of the ceiling showing Moses striking a rock with his rod and bringing forth water for the people of Israel. This was an allusion to the Cardinal, who had brought water to the Villa gardens by making channels through the rock. Other panels show scenes from the life of Moses, a hydra with seven heads, the emblem of the family of Ercole I d&#x27;Este, an ancestor of Ippolito, and fantastic landscapes.

The Hall of Venus originally had as its centerpiece a large fountain, with an artificial cliff and grotto framed in stucco. The fountain featured a basin of water and a classical statue of a sleeping Venus, but in the 19th century the basin was removed and the Venus, which had been removed after the death of the Cardinal, was replaced by two new statues of Peace and Religion, representing a scene at the grotto of Lourdes. The original terra cotta floor is still in place, featuring the white eagle of the d&#x27;Este family. The only other decoration in the room is the 17th-century painting on the ceiling of angels offering flowers to Venus.

The First and Second Tiburtine Halls were created at the same time by a team of painters led by Cesare Nebia; they were made before 1569. and they both have a common plan. The walls are covered with painted architectural elements, including columns and doors and elaborate painted moldings and sculptural elements. Floral designs fill the spaces between the painted architecture, along with medals, masks, and other insignia. The decoration of the two rooms illustrates stories from mythology and the history of Tiburtine region, where the villa is located.

The main theme of the Second Tiburtine Hall is the story of the Tiburtine Sibyl: According to mythology, Queen Ida was punished by Jupiter for having raised young Bacchus to avoid the madness of her husband, Atamante; Venus and Neptune transformed her into a seer, Leucotea. She traveled to Italy where she lived in the Tiburtine forests, giving prophecies and predicting the birth of Christ. Another Tiburtine legend illustrated in the room is that of King Annius, who pursued Mercury, the kidnapper of his daughter Cloris, and was drowned in the river Aniene, which takes his name, and which provides the water for the fountains of the Villa. The Sibyl, King Annius, and the personification of the Aniene River all appear in the frescoes of the room, along with the Triumph of Apollo.

The First Tiburtine Hall illustrates the story of three legendary Greek brothers, Tiburtus, Coras, and Catillus, who defeated the Sicels, an Italic tribe, and built a new city, Tibur (now Tivoli). Their battle is illustrated in the central fresco of the ceiling, as are other events in the founding of the region. The decoration of the room also includes the Tenth Labor of Hercules, where he steals a valuable herd of cattle, and is rescued by Zeus, who showers his enemies with stones; as well as pairs of gods and goddesses in painted niches: Vulcan and Venus, Jupiter and Juno, Apollo with Diana, and Bacchus with Circe. One wall is an illustration of the oval fountain which Ippolito was building at the time the room was decorated.

The Hall of the Fountain was used by Cardinal Ippolito as a reception room for guests who had just arrived through the garden below, and for concerts and other artistic events. The room was built between 1565 and 1570, probably by Girolamo Muziano and his team of artists. The central element is a wall fountain, covered with multicolored ceramics and sculpture, encrusted with pieces of glass, seashells and precious stones, and crowned by the white eagle of the d&#x27;Este family. The fountain was finished in 1568 by Paolo Calandrino. The basin of the fountain rests on two stone dolphins. The reliefs in the central niche depict the fountain of the Tiburtine acropolis and Temple of the Sibyl. On the other walls are images of the house and unfinished garden and fountains, and a small illustration on the opposite wall from the fountain of Ippolito&#x27;s villa in Rome, on the Quirinal Hill, now a residence of the Pope. The paintings on the ceiling are devoted to scenes of mythology; each corner has a portrait of a different god and goddess. Tradition says that the painting of Mercury is a self-portrait of Muziano. The central fresco on the ceiling depicts the Synod of the Gods, with Jupiter in the center surrounded by all the gods of Olympus. The fresco is modeled after a similar work by Raphael in the Loggia of Psyche in the Villa Farnesina. The hall connects with the loggia, and from there a stairway descends to the garden.

The Hall of Hercules dates to 1565–66 and is also by Muziano. The paintings on the ceiling depict eight of the labors of Hercules, surrounded by depictions of landscapes, ancient architecture, and the graces and the virtues. The central painting of the ceiling shows Hercules being welcomed into Olympus by the gods.

The Hall of Nobility was the work of a different artist, Federico Zuccari, and his team of painters. The central fresco on the ceiling depicts &quot;Nobility on the throne between Liberality and Generosity&quot;. The decoration on the walls includes paintings of busts of Plato, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Socrates and other classical philosophers, the Graces and Virtues, and Diana of Ephesus, the goddess of Fertility, who also has a fountain dedicated to her in the garden.

The Hall of Glory was completed between 1566 and 1577 by Federico Zuccari and eight assistants. It is a masterpiece of Roman mannerist painting, with painted illusions of doors, windows, tapestries, sculptures, and of everyday objects used by the Cardinal. The central painting of the ceiling, the Allegory of Glory, has been lost, but there are allegorical depictions of the virtues, the Four Seasons, and of Religion, Magnanimity, Fortune and Time.

The Hall of the Hunt was created later than the other rooms, at the end of the 16th or beginning the 17th century, and is in a different style; it features hunting scenes, rural landscapes, hunting trophies, and, oddly, scenes of naval battles. A stairway of travertine stone, called the &quot;snail stairway&quot;, descends to the garden. It was originally built to access a pallacorda court, an ancestor of tennis, which Ippolito imported into Italy from the French Court. The space where the court was located now houses the cafeteria and bookstore.

The complete construction and furnishing of Ippolito&#x27;s apartments was completed in 1572 when Ippolito was on his deathbed.

==Gardens and fountains==

The fame and glory of the Villa d&#x27;Este was above all established by its extraordinary system of fountains; fifty-one fountains and nymphaeums, 398 spouts, 364 water jets, 64 waterfalls, and 220 basins, fed by 875 metres of canals, channels and cascades, and all working entirely by the force of gravity, without pumps. 
Pirro Ligorio, who was responsible for the iconographic programs worked out in the villa&#x27;s frescos, was also commissioned to lay out the gardens for the villa, with the assistance of Tommaso Chiruchi of Bologna, one of the most skilled hydraulic engineers of the sixteenth century; Chiruchi had worked on the fountains at Villa Lante. At Villa d&#x27;Este he was assisted in the technical designs for the fountains by a Frenchman, Claude Venard, who was a manufacturer of hydraulic organs. The result was one of the finest gardens of the Renaissance, rivaled only by the Villa Lante, the Villa Farnese at Caprarola and the Villas Aldobrandini and Torlonia in Frascati. The garden and water features were admired and imitated over the next two centuries in gardens from Portugal to Saint Petersburg.

The garden plan is laid out on a central axis with subsidiary cross-axes, refreshed by some five hundred jets in fountains, pools and water troughs. The water is supplied by the Aniene, which is partly diverted through the town, a distance of a kilometer, and, originally, by the Rivellese spring, which supplied a cistern under the villa&#x27;s courtyard (now supplied by the Aniene too). The garden is now part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani.

===The Vialone===

A large terrace, 200 metres long, called the Vialone, lies between the Villa and the gardens, with a panoramic view of the gardens and countryside beyond. It was constructed between 1568 and 1569. The Cardinals used the space for fireworks, games, spectacles and festivities. It originally was shaded by two rows of elm trees, except for the space directly in front of the Villa, left empty to preserve the view. The terrace is enclosed at one end by the Fountain of Europa, and at the other by an immense loggia and belvedere in the form of a triumphal arch called the Cenacolo. This structure provided shade beneath in summer, as well as commanding viewpoints of the scenery. It was originally intended to be decorated in the interior with stucco decoration, gilding and frescoes, but it was never finished.

In the center of the terrace, attached to the facade of the villa, is the double loggia, made in 1566–1577 of travertine stone. Its two stairways provide access to the ceremonial salons on the lower floor, while its upper level created a terrace for the Cardinal&#x27;s apartments. On the terrace level it contains a Nymphaeum, or grotto, where the Fountain of Leda is located. The original statuary of the fountain, depicting Jupiter and Leda transformed into a swan and four children, Elena, Clytemnestra, Castor and Pollux. was sold in the 18th century and is now in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. The statuary has been replaced by headless statue of Minerva found in the garden of the Palazzo Manni in Tivoli. The original fountain featured a novel hydraulic trick; water spouting from a vase held by Leda struck a metal disk, which caused flashes of light to reflect on the walls of the grotto.

The Fountain of the Tripod is placed in the center of the Vialone. It has only been there since 1930; it is a copy of an ancient Roman fountain, a marble basin supported by a central column and three pilasters. The original is now in the Louvre. The original fountain on the site, the Fountain of the Sea Horses, which was moved by Ippolito from Hadrian&#x27;s Villa to his garden, is now in the Vatican Museum. 
The Fountain of Europa is found at the northeast end at the top of the garden. It was begun by Ippolito but was not finished until 1671. Its design, a triumphal arch with two orders of columns, corinthian and doric, copying that of the Grand Loggia. The large niche in the center, now empty, held a sculpture &quot;Europa Embracing the Bull&quot; which is now in the Villa Albani in Rome.

=== The upper garden ===

Two ramps lead down to the upper garden from Fountain of the Tripod, and there are symmetrical double flights of stairs at either end. The Cardinal&#x27;s Walk is a shaded path, attached to the retaining wall of the terrace, which leads from one side of the garden to the other, passing by several grottos which are built into the retaining wall. At the southeast end of the walk, just below the Fountain of Europa, is the Grotto of Aegle and Aesculpius. The grotto is decorated with tartar flakes, mosaics and colored fragments of sea shells, and a small portion of the original fresco. It originally held two statues; that of Aesculpius, the god of medicine, now found in the Louvre, and of Aegle, the daughter of Auesculpius, the goddess of healing (now in the Vatican Museum).

The Loggia of Pandora is found in the middle of the Cardinal&#x27;s Walk, just below the center of the Villa. This portion of the walk is covered, with arcades looking out at the garden. It contained a nymphaeum built into the wall, and originally was decorated with mosaics and with a statue of Pandora and two statues of Minerva. The statue of Pandora carried a vase of water, symbolizing the evils of the world. The vase was a concealed fountain, pouring out water. The statues were sold in the 18th century; Pandora and one of the Minervas are now in the Capitoline Museum. In the 19th century the nymphaeum was converted into a Christian chapel; it was a favorite place of the composer Franz Liszt, who dedicated two pieces of music to the chapel.

The Fountain of the Bicchierone is one of two fountains created for the Villa by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It was made between 1660 and 1661 on a commission from Cardinal Rinaldo I d&#x27;Este. The basin of the fountain is in the form of a large shell, which reaches up to the level of the terrace. In the center is a toothed &quot;Bicchierone&quot; (cup or chalice) from which the water sprays upwards. Bernini supervised the building of the fountain, and, following its inauguration in May 1661, he had the height of the spouting water reduced, to avoid blocking the view from the Loggia of Pandora. Though not part of the original design of the garden, the fountain became a link between the architecture of the palace and the garden.

The Loggetta of the Cardinal is a small balustraded terrace surrounded by high laurel hedges and stone benches, between the Fountain of the Biccherone and the garden. This was said to be the Cardinal&#x27;s favorite spot for reading and discussing poetry and art, and watching the construction of the garden around him. Shortly after his death, a large statue of Hercules, with the boy Achilles in his arms, was placed there, overlooking the garden below. It was one of three statues of Hercules in central positions along the central axis. When seen from the bottom the garden, they were all visible, aligned with the Loggia of the Villa at the top. The statue is now found in the Louvre.

The Grotto of Diana is located at the end of the Cardinal&#x27;s Walk, below the Gran Loggia. It is a large underground vaulted chamber, decorated in 1570–72 by Paolo Caladrino, and completely covered with mosaics of mythological scenes, with images of fish, dragons, dolphins, pelicans and other animals, as well as the eagles and apples of the d&#x27;Este family. Its central feature was a rustic fountain with statue of the goddess Diana, in a large niche decorated with stuccol reliefs of landscapes, the sea and a ship. All of the statues were sold in the 18th century and are now in the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Some of the original majolica floor tiles from the 16th century can still be seen.

Below the Loggetta of the Cardinal is a walkway which traverses the garde passes by three grottos. In the center is the Grotto of Hercules, which is covered by the Loggetta of the Cardinal. Beneath this grotto was a cistern and some of the hydraulic machinery for the fountains below. The grotto once had stucco reliefs of either animals or the labors of Hercules. The statue of Hercules in repose formerly in the grotto is now in the Vatican Museum. The Grotto of Pomona is similar in design to the Grotto of Hercules. Some of the original mosaic decoration is still visible. The water poured into a fountain from a white marble mask, which was found when the fountain was restored in 2002.

===The Oval Fountain (&quot;Fontana dell&#x27;Ovato&quot;)===

The Oval Fountain was one of the first fountains in the garden, and among the most famous. It was designed by Pirro Ligorio, the architect of the villa, as a water theater, spraying water in variety of forms. It was begun in 1565 and finished in 1570. It was made by fountain engineers Tomasso de Como and Curzio Maccarono, with sculpture by Raffaello Sangallo. A massive stone basin against the semicircular back wall cascades water into the fountain, and sprays it into the air, while water jets into the basin from vases in the hands of statues of Nereids, and also sprays in fan shapes from vases in niches in the semi-circular wall behind the fountain. An artificial mountain rises above the fountain, symbolizing the Tiburtine landscape; the mountain is pierced by three grottos, each pouring forth water, and is decorated with statues representing Albunea, with her son Melicerte, by Gillis van den Vliete (1568), and statues representing rivers Ercolaneo and Aniene, by Giovanni Malanca (1566), all of which pour water into the Oval Fountain. An upper walkway above the fountain leads past the ring of basins and cascades. The fountain also has its own grotto, the Grotto of Venus, designed by Pirro Ligorio, and built in 1565–68. It served as a meeting place for guests on hot summer days. The original statues of the grotto; a figure of Venus similar to the Capitoline Venus and two &quot;putti&quot; are no longer there, but traces of the monochrome murals of grotesque figures, tiles and sculpted grotto walls still remain.

===The Hundred Fountains (&quot;Cento Fontane&quot;)===

The Hundred Fountains were another celebrated marvel of the gardens in the Renaissance. They are located between the oval fountain and the Fontana di Rometta, and there are actually nearly three hundred spouts fed by three parallel canals, one above the other. Along the edge of the upper canal there are spouts in the form of lilies, the emblem of France, alternating with the d&#x27;Este eagle, boats and obelisks; all spraying water in a fan shape. The water is captured by the second canal, which feeds it into spouts in the form of masks, from which it reaches the lower canal.

The fountains were constructed between 1566 and 1577. The original alley of fountains had more decoration, including small boats alternating with terra cotta vases along the upper canal, planted with fruit trees; and the wall was decorated with sculptural plaques showing scenes from the &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; of Ovid. These deteriorated quickly and were largely removed or replaced. The wall is now so overgrown with vegetation that little of remaining decoration can be seen. It was restored in the 17th century, then abandoned for a long period, and finally restored again in 1930 to its present form. Like every other feature of the garden, canals and the hundred fountains had their part in the symbolic plan; they represented the aqueducts the Romans built to supply water to Rome. The Hundred Fountains have been celebrated in Italian art and literature, particularly in the &quot;Roman Elegies&quot; of Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio.

To descend to the next level, there are stairs at either end – the elaborate fountain complex called the &quot;Rometta&quot; (&quot;the little Rome&quot;) is at the far left – to view the full length of the &quot;Hundred Fountains&quot; on the next level, where the water jets fill the long rustic trough, and Pirro Ligorio&#x27;s &quot;Fontana dell&#x27;Ovato&quot; ends the cross-vista. A visitor may walk behind the water through the rusticated arcade of the concave nymphaeum, which is peopled by marble nymphas by Giambattista della Porta. Above the nymphaeum, the sculpture of &quot;Pegasus&quot; recalls to the visitor the fountain of Hippocrene on Parnassus, haunt of the Muses.

This terrace is united to the next by the central Fountain of the Dragons, dominating the central perspective of the gardens, erected for a visit in 1572 of Pope Gregory XIII whose coat-of-arms features a dragon. The sound of this fountain was in contrast to a nearby &quot;Uccellario&quot; with artificial birds. Central stairs lead down a wooded slope to three rectangular fishponds set on the cross-axis at the lowest point of the gardens, terminated at the right by the water organ (now brought back into use) and Fountain of Neptune (belonging to the 20th century restorations).

===The Fountain of Rometta ()===

The Fountain of Rometta is located at the opposite end of the Hundred Fountains from the Oval Fountain. It is an important piece of the symbolic story told by the upper gardens; the waters of the Tiber River emerge in the Tiburtin Mountains, symbolized by the Oval Fountain, run through the valley (The Hundred Fountains) and arrive at the gates of Rome; the Rometta Fountain is ancient Rome in miniature; the real city was visible in the distance behind the Fountain. The fountain was designed by Pirro Ligorio and built by Curzio Maccarone between 1567 and 1570. The fountain and its architecture are built on a wide semicircular Terrace supported by pilasters connected with a double arcades. The back portion of the fountain represents the buildings the monuments if Rome; deteriorated greatly in the early 19th century, and a large part was demolished in 1850, but a portion of this architecture still stands on the left side of the fountain. The small buildings were divided into seven sections, representing the seven hills of Rome and their most famous monuments. The little city included gates and arches, and even small marble statues. In the center of the miniature city is a large statue of &quot;Rome Victorious,&quot; made in 1568 by the Fliemish sculptor Pierre de la Motte, facing the statue of the Tiburtine Sibyl at the other end of the row of Hundred Fountains. Another statue by the same artist, &quot;The She Wolf nurses her Twins&quot;, was placed in the garden in 1611. The water flowing through fountain basin next to the city represents the Tiber River; the boat in the fountain, with a mast in the form an obelisk, symbolizes the Tiburtina Island.

A new feature was added to the Fountain of Rometta in the early 17th century; an artificial mountain, pierced by grottos and caves, to left of the city buildings. On the top of the artificial mountain is a statue of the river god Aniene, holding in his hand a miniature of the Temple of the Sibyl. A statue of a figure representing the Apennine mountains, holding a mountain in his arms. is half-hidden in a grotto.

===The Fountain of the Dragons (&quot;Fontana dei Draghi&quot;)===

The Fountain of the Dragons was designed by Pirro Ligorio to illustrate the story of Hercules fulfilling one of his labors by stealing the golden apples of the Garden of the Hesperides, which were guarded by the dragon Ladon. The same story is illustrated in frescoes in the interior decoration of the Villa.

The fountain is located on the central vertical axis of the gardens, aligned with the Villa, and in the center of the original garden. just below the Hundred Fountains. It is enclosed by two semi-circular ramps which lead to the level above. The walls of the ramps around it are covered with pebbly tartar and ornamented with bands of mosaic and majolica tile, and contain two large niches. Ligorio planned this fountain to illustrate the theme of war and combat against evil; he intended that one niche would be occupied by a statue of Hercules with his club, before he killed the dragon Ladon; and the second with statues of Mars, the god of War, Perseus, and gladiators. In the center of the fountain is a small &quot;scogliera&quot; or island, which holds four sculpted dragons, which jet water from their mouths into the fountain, while a powerful central fountain shoots a column of water vertically high in the air, visible from all around the garden This idea of a vertical jet of water as the centerpiece of the garden was copied in many baroque gardens in the 17th and 18th centuries. In addition to the dragons, two sculpted dolphins spray water across the pool. More water flows down from above, running in channels attached to the parapets of the ramps. The water emerges from the breasts of two sphinxes- half-women, half sea horses; flows down a channel, enters the mouth of a sculpted frog, and emerges again through the mouth of a carved salamander. In keeping with the theme of combat against evil, in Ippolito&#x27;s time the fountains also produced dramatic sound effects heard throughout the garden; water kept under pressure was suddenly released, imitating the sound of fireworks or cannons firing. To make more noise, the flow of water from above could also be from a fine spray to a heavy downpour.

Ippolito had the fountain altered for the visit of Pope Gregory in 1572. The dragon with one hundred heads was replaced by four dragons, the family emblem of the Pope. Ippolito died three months later, and the fountain was still not completed. It was not finished until late in the 17th century with a different sculptural program; Instead of a statue of Hercules, a statue of the god Jupiter holding lightning bolts in his hands was placed in the central niche. The cannon-like sound effects from the fountain now were meant to be the sound of his thunderbolts.

===The Fountain of the Owl (&quot;Fontana della Civetta&quot;)===

The Fountain of the Owl is located in the Southwest part of the garden, below the Fountain of Rometta and the Fountain of Persephone, These three fountains form a single unit of architecture, their terraces connected by stairways, with nymphaeums placed beneath the terraces. The Fountain of the Owl was built between 1565 and 1569 by Giovanni del Duca. Compared with other fountains in the garden, it is very formal, placed on a terrace surrounded by walls with niches, crowned with the white eagles and lily symbols of the d&#x27;Este. The fountain itself is a separate structure, entirely covered with polychrome tiles. At the top, above the niche, is the coat of arms of the d&#x27;Este, held by two angels. The niche is flanked by ionic columns. Originally it contained the statues of two youths holding a goatskin which poured water into a basin held by three satyrs. The sculpture in the niche, believed lost, was rediscovered during a renovation in 2001–02, hidden under mineral deposits and earth. The architectural elements were intact, but the figures of the youths and satyrs were missing or destroyed.

This fountain also produced music, thanks to an ingenious automaton made by the French fountain engineer Luc Leclerc, installed in 1566, before the Fountain of the Organ on the other side of the garden. It featured twenty painted bronze birds placed in the niche, posed on two metal olive branches. Each bird sang an individual song, produced by piped water and air. A mechanical owl appeared, and the birds stopped singing; then, at the end of the performance, all the birds sang together. This musical feature was admired and copied in other European gardens and functioned until the end of the 17th century. It needed constant repair due to the action of the water on its delicate mechanism, and by the 19th century were completely ruined. The decorative elements of the fountain were completely restored in the 1930s, and restored again in 2001–2002.

During the restoration work of 2001–02, the workers found some of the original mechanism that produced the bird songs, including the wind chamber, the tubes that moved the air and water, and the machinery that made the owl move. Using modern materials, Leonardo Lombardi was able to make a new version of the old machinery so the birds can sing and move again.

===The Fountain of Persephone (&quot;Fontana di Proserpina&quot;)===

The Fountain of Persephone is located just above the Fountain of the Owl; a stairway connects them. It was sometimes called the Fountain of the Emperors, because it was originally intended to display statues of four Roman Emperors who had villas in the region: Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, Trajan and Hadrian. It was designed and built by Alberto Galvani in 1569–70. It was connected with the Rometta Fountain above by two stairways (only one remains today) whose parapets support channels of water pouring through shells and masks. The stairways close two sides of the small fountain courtyard. The fountain is placed in a triumphal arch between the stairways. The arch is framed by twisting columns, similar to those in Saint Peter&#x27;s basilica in Rome. The central niche held a statue of the goddess of fertility Persephone being kidnapped by Pluto, placed there in about 1640. The statue of Persephone has disappeared; Pluto remains, carried on a shell supported by two sea horses. Niches on the sides hold statues of Tritons riding dolphins and blowing on their &quot;buccina&quot;, or seashell trumpets.

===The Fountain of the Organ (&quot;Fontana dell&#x27;Organo&quot;)===

The Fountain of the Organ (&quot;Fontana dell&#x27;Organo&quot;) is one of the most famous features of the garden; it was described and imitated throughout Europe. Work on the masonry structure began in 1566. The fountain itself was made by the French fountain engineer Luc Leclerc and his nephew Claude Venard. After the death of Leclerc, Venard invented the ingenious mechanism of the water organ, which was installed in 1571.

The fountain was the first of its kind, and astonished everyone who heard it; when Pope Gregory XIII visited the villa in 1572, accompanied by his court of cardinals and princes, he insisted on inspecting the interior of the fountain, to learn if someone was not concealed inside making the music.

A massive masonry arch behind the fountain, the &quot;castellum aquae&quot; or water castle, conceals the water reservoir and the hydraulic machinery of the fountain. The original design featured a grotto in the niche of the arch, with a view of the twenty-two pipes of the organ. A statue of &quot;Mother Nature&quot; or the &quot;Ephesian Diana&quot; was placed in front of the arch in 1569; it now has its own fountain in the lower garden.

The water creating the music arrived first at the top of the &quot;Castellum aquae&quot;. It went first through a series of whirlpools, which mixed air with the water; then it dropped down a pipe into the &quot;camera aeolia&quot;, or wind chamber, where the air and water were separated; the water turned a wheel, rotating a cylinder which opened the valves of the twenty-two pipes, so the air could pass through the pipes and make the music.

The original performances of the fountain began with the sound of two trumpets, held by the statue of Fame on the cornice of the fountain. Then came the music, likely madrigals played by four or five pipes; then the climax: &quot;The Flood&quot;, a cascade of water from the top of the fountain, and jets of water shooting up from the fountain below. This was accompanied by the sound of a horn held by a &quot;Triton&quot; in the fountain; the horn blew softly, then loudly, then softly again.

The mechanism of the fountain was extremely delicate and required continual cleaning and maintenance. The fountain was restored in the early 18th century by Cardinal Alessandro d&#x27;Este, who added the white d&#x27;Este eagle to the top of the &quot;castellum aquae&quot;, and ornamented the facade with statues of Orpheus and Apollo; Caryatids and Winged Victories; and bas-reliefs of Orpheus entrancing the animals and a musical contest between Apollo and Marsia. The organ itself was entirely redone. It was given a keyboard with a wider range of notes and was housed in an octagonal kiosk with a cupola. The organ was restored several more times in the 17th century, but by the end of the 18th century, it had deteriorated beyond hope of repair.

In 2003, after a long and delicate restoration, the organ was able to play again. The original wind chamber and tank for creating whirlpools were retained, and the rest of the mechanism was replaced with new machinery in modern materials following the original principles. It now has 144 pipes, and is controlled by a cylinder, operated by the water, which can play four pieces of late Renaissance music for a total of four minutes.

===The Fountain of Neptune (&quot;Fontana di Nettuno&quot;) and the Fish ponds (&quot;Peschiere&quot;)===
Directly below the Fountain of the Organ, and receiving the water from the upper fountain, is the Fountain of Neptune, a work created in the 20th century to replace a garden landmark which had deteriorated.

The space was originally occupied by a rocky cascade, created in the 17th century by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It was commissioned by Cardinal Rinado I d&#x27;Este as a background for the lateral axis of the garden, unfinished by Cardinal Ippolito. Bernini&#x27;s plan called for a waterfall from the Fountain of the Organ which leaped over the grottoes of the Sibyls, then cascaded down a rocky slope to a lake decorated with reefs and statues. Two additional cascades entered the lake from the sides. Bernini designed the cascade to produce a thunderous sound of falling water. Bernini&#x27;s cascade was reproduced in paintings and engravings, and was imitated in other gardens in Italy and as far away as England. The cascade was entirely neglected for two centuries, dry, crumbling and overgrown with vegetation. In the 1930s the architect Attilio Rossi created the present fountain, using what remained of Bernini&#x27;s cascade. Against the wall of the Grottoes of the Sibyls, he built rectangular pools with powerful water jets, the tallest jets in the center. The centerpiece was a grotto beneath the waterfall from the Fountain of the Organ; the grotto contained a 16th-century torso of a statue of Neptune, which had originally been intended for an unfinished fountain of the seas. Other jets of water in fan shapes rise from pools on the sides of the fountain.

The three fish ponds (&quot;Peschiere&quot;) cross the garden from the Fountain of Neptune. They served originally to provide fresh fish, duck, and swan for the table of the Cardinal, and also, in the plan of Pirro Ligorio, were intended to connect two fountains; the Fountain of the Organ and the cascade and the Fountain of the Seas. In the center of the ponds, Ligorio had originally planned to create a central pond with monumental fountains. However, when Ippolito died in 1572 only two of the ponds had been completed. In the late 16th century the ponds were lined by sixteen tall pilasters in the form of &quot;ermes&quot; which jetted out fan-shaped sprays of water, creating a multitude of rainbows on a sunny day.

In 1632 the Duke of Modena, in charge of the Villa, entirely remodeled the ponds. The pilasters were removed and replaced with eight pedestals with vases which spouted water, and with twenty-four large pots containing a variety of citrus trees. The ponds now serve primarily as a picturesque foreground for cascades and fountains of the Fountain of Neptune.

==The lower garden – The Rotonda of the Cypresses and the Fountain of Diana of Ephesus==
In the 16th century the lower garden, below the fishponds, was originally largely a kitchen garden. The center of the lower garden was divided into sixteen large squares, with a pergola in the center of each section, surrounded by beds of medicinal herbs and flowers, and large pots of fruit trees. The main paths dividing the garden were covered with trellises on which grew grapes, heather and jasmine. In the center was a large wooden pavilion, which contained four small fountains in the form of flowers, jetting water. The pergolas and pavilion were demolished in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and replaced by the Rotonda of the Cypresses, a circular alley which originally contained sixteen cypress trees, and offered shade to visitors arriving in the gardens, as well as a dramatic view of the rest of the garden, the fountains and the Villa high above. By the 19th century the cypress trees were huge, and were among the most famous features of gardens, painted by artists and inspiring music by Franz Liszt and poetry by Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio. Two of the original cypress trees are still there; the other cypresses and laurel hedges were planted at the end of the 20th century.

The Fountains of the d&#x27;Este eagle are a group of small rustic fountains, with water spurting up from stone bowls, with a variety of themes. One contains a group of statues of the white eagle, the emblem of the d&#x27;Este family. These fountains are a vestige the formal gardens that occupied that part of the garden before the Rotonda of Cypresses was built.

The lower garden also contains two large rustic fountains, called the Mete, located on the northwest corner of the garden near the entrance. They were designed to look like natural rock, with grottos and niches. Created in 1568–69, they were made by Tommaso da Como, and were originally intended to feature two large statues of giants, the guardians of the garden. A smaller rustic fountain, called the Fontana Rustca dell&#x27;Inverno, holds a 16th-century statue of Winter that originally was in the Gran Loggia.

The most famous fountain in the lower garden is the Fountain of Diana of Ephesus, also known as the Fountain of Mother Nature. This statue originally stood next to the Fountain of the Organ; it was moved to the lower garden by Alessandro d&#x27;Este in the 16th century. It was made by the Flemish sculptor Gillis van den Vliete in 1568, and modeled after a classical Roman statue of Diana of Ephesus from the second century, now in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples. It stands in a grotto made of tartar flakes; jets of water spurt from the multiple breasts of the goddess.

==In art==
Few gardens have been painted or drawn by as many notable artists than the Villa d&#x27;Este, particularly during the Renaissance and in the 19th century. As a result, features of the garden influenced and were imitated in other gardens across Europe, from England to Russia. In the Renaissance, the garden was seen as a showcase of classical art and new technology, but by the end of the 18th century, when the garden was overgrown and crumbling, it helped created the image of the picturesque romantic garden. 
The garden is the setting and filming location of Kenneth Anger&#x27;s 1953 short film, &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot;, as well as the 1972 film &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot;, where Bruce Lee and Nora Miao take a tour of the gardens. Filming also took place at the Villa d&#x27;Este for &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; (2003) and &quot;To Rome with Love&quot;.

== Visiting the Villa ==

<text>Abu&#x27;l Hasan Yamīn ud-Dīn Khusrau (1253 – 1325 AD), better known as Amīr Khusrau, sometimes spelled as, Amir Khusrow or Amir Khusro, was an Indo-Persian Sufi singer, musician, poet and scholar, who lived during the period of the Delhi Sultanate. 

He is an iconic figure in the cultural history of the Indian subcontinent. He was a mystic and a spiritual disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi, India. He wrote poetry primarily in Persian, but also in Hindavi and Punjabi. A vocabulary in verse, the &quot;Ḳhāliq Bārī&quot;, containing Arabic, Persian and Hindavi terms is often attributed to him. Khusrau is sometimes referred to as the &quot;voice of India&quot; or &quot;Parrot of India&quot; (&quot;Tuti-e-Hind&quot;).

Khusrau is regarded as the &quot;father of qawwali&quot; (a devotional form of singing of the Sufis in the Indian subcontinent), and introduced the ghazal style of song into India, both of which still exist widely in India and Pakistan.
Khusrau was an expert in many styles of Persian poetry which were developed in medieval Persia, from Khāqānī&#x27;s &quot;qasidas&quot; to Nizami&#x27;s &quot;khamsa&quot;. He used 11 metrical schemes with 35 distinct divisions. He wrote in many verse forms including ghazal, masnavi, qata, rubai, do-baiti and tarkib-band. His contribution to the development of the ghazal was significant.

==Family background==
Amīr Khusrau was born in 1253 in Patiyali, Kasganj district, in modern-day Uttar Pradesh, India, in what was then the Delhi Sultanate, the son of Amīr Saif ud-Dīn Mahmūd, a man of Turkic extraction and Bibi Daulat Naz, a native Indian mother. Amir Saif ud-Din Mahmud was a Sunni Muslim. He grew up in Kesh, a small town near Samarkand in what is now Uzbekistan. When he was a young man, the region was destroyed and ravaged by Genghis Khan&#x27;s invasion of Central Asia, and much of the population fled to other lands, India being a favored destination. A group of families, including that of Amir Saif ud-Din, left Kesh and travelled to Balkh (now in northern Afghanistan), which was a relatively safe place; from there, they sent representatives to the Sultan of distant Delhi seeking refuge. This was granted, and the group then travelled to Delhi. Sultan Shams ud-Din Iltutmish, ruler of Delhi, was also Turkic like them; indeed, he had grown up in the same region of Central Asia and had undergone somewhat similar circumstances in earlier life. This was the reason the group had turned to him in the first place. Iltutmish not only welcomed the refugees to his court but also granted high offices and landed estates to some of them. In 1230, Amir Saif ud-Din was granted a fief in the district of Patiyali.

Amir Saif ud-Din married Bibi Daulat Naz, the daughter of Rawat Arz, an Indian noble and war minister of Ghiyas ud-Din Balban, the ninth Sultan of Delhi.

==Early years==
Amir Saif ud-Din and Bibi Daulatnaz became the parents of four children: three sons (one of whom was Khusrau) and a daughter. Amir Saif ud-Din Mahmud died in 1260, when Khusrau was only eight years old. Through his father&#x27;s influence, he imbibed Islam and Sufism coupled with proficiency in Turkish, Persian, and Arabic languages. He was known by his sobriquet &quot;Tuti-i Hind&quot; (&quot;Parrot of India&quot;), which according to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; &quot;compares the eloquent poet to the sweet-talking parrot, indicates his canonical status as a poet of Persian.&quot; Khusrau&#x27;s love and admiration for his motherland is transparent through his work.

Khusrau was an intelligent child. He started learning and writing poetry at the age of nine. His first divan, &quot;Tuhfat us-Sighr&quot; (The Gift of Childhood), containing poems composed between the ages of 16 and 18, was compiled in 1271. In 1273, when Khusrau was 20 years old, his grandfather, who was reportedly 113 years old, died.

==Career==
After Khusrau&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s death, Khusrau joined the army of Malik Chajju, a nephew of the reigning Sultan, Ghiyas ud-Din Balban. This brought his poetry to the attention of the Assembly of the Royal Court where he was honoured.

Nasir ud-Din Bughra Khan, the second son of Balban, was invited to listen to Khusrau. He was impressed and became Khusrau&#x27;s patron in 1276. In 1277 Bughra Khan was then appointed ruler of Bengal, and Khusrau visited him in 1279 while writing his second divan, &quot;Wast ul-Hayat&quot; (The Middle of Life). Khusrau then returned to Delhi. Balban&#x27;s eldest son, Khan Muhammad (who was in Multan), arrived in Delhi, and when he heard about Khusrau, he invited him to his court. Khusrau then accompanied him to Multan in 1281. Multan at the time was the gateway to India and was a center of knowledge and learning. Caravans of scholars, tradesmen and emissaries transited through Multan from Baghdad, Arabia and Persia on their way to Delhi. Khusrau wrote that:
On 9 March 1285, Khan Muhammad was killed in battle while fighting Mongols who were invading the Sultanate. Khusrau wrote two elegies in grief of his death. In 1287, Khusrau travelled to Awadh with another of his patrons, Amir Ali Hatim. At the age of eighty, Balban called his second son Bughra Khan back from Bengal, but Bughra Khan refused. After Balban&#x27;s death in 1287, his grandson Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad, Bughra Khan&#x27;s son, was made the Sultan of Delhi at the age of 17. Khusrau remained in Qaiqabad&#x27;s service for two years, from 1287 to 1288. In 1288, Khusrau finished his first masnavi, &quot;Qiran us-Sa&#x27;dain&quot; (Meeting of the Two Auspicious Stars), which was about Bughra Khan meeting his son Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad after a long enmity. After Qaiqabad suffered a stroke in 1290, nobles appointed his three-year-old son Shams ud-Din Kayumars as Sultan. A Turko-Afghan named Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji then marched on Delhi, killed Qaiqabad and became Sultan, thus ending the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate and starting the Khalji dynasty.

Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji appreciated poetry and invited many poets to his court. Khusrau was honoured and respected in his court and was given the title &quot;Amir&quot;. He was given the job of &quot;Mushaf-dar&quot;. Court life made Khusrau focus more on his literary works. Khusrau&#x27;s ghazals which he composed in quick succession were set to music and were sung by singing girls every night before the Sultan. Khusrau writes about Jalal ud-Din Firuz:
In 1290, Khusrau completed his second masnavi, &quot;Miftah ul-Futuh&quot; (Key to the Victories), in praise of Jalal ud-Din Firuz&#x27;s victories. In 1294, Khusrau completed his third divan, &quot;Ghurrat ul-Kamaal&quot; (The Prime of Perfection), which consisted of poems composed between the ages of 34 and 41.

After Jalal ud-Din Firuz, Ala ud-Din Khalji ascended to the throne of Delhi in 1296. Khusrau wrote the &quot;Khaza&#x27;in ul-Futuh&quot; (The Treasures of Victory) recording Ala ud-Din&#x27;s construction works, wars and administrative services. He then composed a khamsa (quintet) with five masnavis, known as &quot;Khamsa-e-Khusrau&quot; (Khamsa of Khusrau), completing it in 1298. The khamsa emulated that of the earlier poet of Persian epics, Nizami Ganjavi. The first masnavi in the khamsa was &quot;Matla ul-Anwar&quot; (Rising Place of Lights) consisting of 3310 verses (completed in 15 days) with ethical and Sufi themes. The second masnavi, &quot;Khusrau-Shirin&quot;, consisted of 4000 verses. The third masnavi, &quot;Laila-Majnun&quot;, was a romance. The fourth voluminous masnavi was &quot;Ayina-i Iskandari&quot;, which narrated the heroic deeds of Alexander the Great in 4500 verses. The fifth masnavi was &quot;Hasht-Bihisht&quot;, which was based on legends about Bahram V, the fifteenth king of the Sasanian Empire. All these works made Khusrau a leading luminary in the world of poetry. Ala ud-Din Khalji was highly pleased with his work and rewarded him handsomely. When Ala ud-Din&#x27;s son and future successor Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji was born, Khusrau prepared the horoscope of Mubarak Shah Khalji in which certain predictions were made. This horoscope is included in the masnavi &quot;Saqiana&quot;.

In 1300, when Khusrau was 47 years old, his mother and brother died. He wrote these lines in their honour:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
A double radiance left my star this year
Gone are my brother and my mother,
My two full moons have set and ceased to shine
In one short week through this ill-luck of mine.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Khusrau&#x27;s homage to his mother on her death was:
In 1310, Khusrau became a disciple of Sufi saint of the Chishti Order, Nizamuddin Auliya. In 1315, Khusrau completed the romantic masnavi &quot;Duval Rani - Khizr Khan&quot; (Duval Rani and Khizr Khan), about the marriage of the Vaghela princess Duval Rani to Khizr Khan, one of Ala ud-Din Khalji&#x27;s sons.

After Ala ud-Din Khalji&#x27;s death in 1316, his son Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji became the Sultan of Delhi. Khusrau wrote a masnavi on Mubarak Shah Khalji called &quot;Nuh Sipihr&quot; (Nine Skies), which described the events of Mubarak Shah Khalji&#x27;s reign. He classified his poetry in nine chapters, each part of which is considered a &quot;sky&quot;. In the third chapter he wrote a vivid account of India and its environment, seasons, flora and fauna, cultures, scholars, etc. He wrote another book during Mubarak Shah Khalji&#x27;s reign by name of &quot;Ijaz-e-Khusravi&quot; (The Miracles of Khusrau), which consisted of five volumes. In 1317 Khusrau compiled &quot;Baqia-Naqia&quot; (Remnants of Purity). In 1319 he wrote &quot;Afzal ul-Fawaid&quot; (Greatest of Blessings), a work of prose that contained the teachings of Nizamuddin Auliya.

In 1320, Mubarak Shah Khalji was killed by Khusro Khan, who thus ended the Khalji dynasty and briefly became Sultan of Delhi. Within the same year, Khusro Khan was captured and beheaded by Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq, who became Sultan and thus began the Tughlaq dynasty. In 1321, Khusrau began to write a historic masnavi named &quot;Tughlaq Nama&quot; (Book of the Tughlaqs) about the reign of Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq and that of other Tughlaq rulers.

Khusrau died in October 1325, six months after the death of Nizamuddin Auliya. Khusrau&#x27;s tomb is next to that of his spiritual master in the Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi. &quot;Nihayat ul-Kamaal&quot; (The Zenith of Perfection) was compiled probably a few weeks before his death.

===Shalimar Bagh Inscription===
A popular fable which has made its way into scholarship ascribes the following famous Persian verse to Khusrau:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Agar Firdaus bar ru-ye zamin ast,
Hamin ast o hamin ast o hamin ast.
&lt;/poem&gt;
In English: &quot;If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this.&quot;
This verse is believed to have been inscribed on several Mughal structures, supposedly in reference to Kashmir, specifically a particular building at the Shalimar Garden in Srinagar, Kashmir (built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir).

However, recent scholarship has traced the verse to a time much later than that of Khusrau and to a place quite distant from Kashmir. Historian Rana Safvi inspected all probable buildings in the Kashmir garden and found no such inscription attributed to Khusrau. According to her the verse was composed by Sa&#x27;adullah Khan, a leading noble and scholar in the court of Jahangir&#x27;s successor and son Shah Jahan. Even in popular memory, it was Jahangir who first repeated the phrase in praise of Kashmir.

==Contributions to Hindustani music==
=== Qawwali ===

Khusrau is credited with fusing the Persian, Arabic, Turkic, and Indian singing traditions in the late 13th century to create qawwali, a form of Sufi devotional song. A well-punctuated chorus emphasising the theme and devotional refrain coupled with a lead singer utilising an ornate style of fast taans and difficult svara combinations are the distinguishing characteristics of a qawwali. Khusrau&#x27;s disciples who specialised in Qawwali singing were later classified as Qawwals (they sang only Muslim devotional songs) and Kalawants (they sang mundane songs in the Qawwali style). The musical flow of some of his poems has made them favorites of musicians even today.

=== Tarana and Trivat ===
Tarana and Trivat are also credited to Khusrau. Musicologist and philosopher Jaidev Singh has said:
Tarana was entirely an invention of Khusrau. Tarana is a Persian word meaning a song. Tillana is a corrupt form of this word. True, Khusrau had before him the example of Nirgit songs using śuṣk-akṣaras (meaningless words) and pāṭ-akṣaras (mnemonic syllables of the mridang). Such songs were in vogue at least from the time of Bharat. But generally speaking, the Nirgit used hard consonants. Khusrau introduced two innovations in this form of vocal music. Firstly, he introduced mostly Persian words with soft consonants. Secondly, he so arranged these words that they bore some sense. He also introduced a few Hindi words to complete the sense…. It was only Khusrau&#x27;s genius that could arrange these words in such a way to yield some meaning. Composers after him could not succeed in doing so, and the tarana became as meaningless as the ancient Nirgit.
It is believed that Khusrau invented the tarana style during his attempt to reproduce Gopal Naik&#x27;s exposition in raag Kadambak. Khusrau hid and listened to Gopal Naik for six days, and on the seventh day, he reproduced Naik&#x27;s rendition using meaningless words (mridang bols) thus creating the tarana style.

=== Sitar ===
Khusrau is credited for the invention of the sitar. At the time, there were many versions of the Veena in India. He modified the three stringed Tritantri Veena as a &quot;Setar&quot; (Persian for 3 stringed), which eventually became known as the &quot;sitar&quot;.

==Legacy==
Amir Khusrau was a prolific classical poet associated with the royal courts of more than seven rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. He wrote many playful riddles, songs and legends which have become a part of popular culture in South Asia. His riddles are one of the most popular forms of Hindavi poetry today. It is a genre that involves double entendre or wordplay. Innumerable riddles by the poet have been passed through oral tradition over the last seven centuries. Through his literary output, Khusrau represents one of the first recorded Indian personages with a true multicultural or pluralistic identity. Musicians credit Khusrau with the creation of six styles of music: , but there is insufficient evidence for this.

===Development of Hindavi===

Khusrau wrote primarily in Persian. Many Hindustani (or Hindi-Urdu) verses are attributed to him, since there is no evidence for their composition by Khusrau before the 18th century. The language of the Hindustani verses appears to be relatively modern. He used the term &#x27;Hindavi&#x27; (meaning &#x27;of Hindu, i.e. India or Indians&#x27; in Persian) for the Hindustani language, and gave shape to it in the Islamic literature.

He also wrote a war ballad in Punjabi. In addition, he spoke Arabic and Sanskrit. His poetry is still sung today at Sufi shrines throughout India and Pakistan.

== In popular culture ==
The 1978 film &quot;Junoon&quot; opens with a rendition of Khusrau&#x27;s &quot;Aaj Rung Hai&quot;, and the film&#x27;s plot sees the poem employed as a symbol of rebellion.

&quot;Amir Khusro&quot;, a documentary feature covering his life and works directed by Om Prakash Sharma released in 1974. It was produced by the Government of India&#x27;s Film&#x27;s Division.

&quot;Amir Khusro&quot;, an Indian television series based on Khusrau&#x27;s life and works aired on DD National, the national public broadcaster, in the 1980s. He was portrayed by actor Bhawani Muzamil as a court poet of Alauddin Khalji in the 2018 Indian film &quot;Padmaavat&quot; by Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

One of Khusro&#x27;s poems on Basant, &quot;Sakal bun phool rahi sarson&quot;, was quoted in an episode of Saladin Ahmed&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ms. Marvel.&quot; Various renditions of this poem have been recorded time and again, including one sung by Rizwan-Muazzam in Season 8 of &quot;Coke Studio Pakistan&quot;, as well as another rendition by Pakistani singer Meesha Shafi in collaboration with the instrumental funk band Mughal-e-Funk. It was also recreated in the Netflix web series &quot;Heeramandi&quot;, sung by Raja Hassan.

<text>Americana is the fifth studio album by American rock band the Offspring, released on November 17, 1998, by Columbia Records. Following a worldwide tour in support of &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; (1997), the band commenced work on a new album in July 1998, with the recording sessions lasting for about two months. It was The Offspring&#x27;s second and last album to be produced by Dave Jerden.

&quot;Americana&quot; was a major success, debuting at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling over 198,000 copies in its first week. It is the band&#x27;s second best-selling album after their 1994 breakout, &quot;Smash&quot;, and has sold over ten million copies worldwide. &quot;Americana&quot; spawned the hit singles &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Get a Job?&quot; and &quot;The Kids Aren&#x27;t Alright&quot;, and was promoted with a worldwide tour and an appearance at the Woodstock &#x27;99 festival.

==Background and recording==
After the unexpected success of &quot;Smash&quot; (1994), the Offspring were signed to Columbia Records in 1996, releasing the fourth studio album, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; (1997). Although &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; was not as well received as &quot;Smash&quot;, it managed simultaneous gold and platinum certifications in the United States in April 1997. After touring in support of &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;, the Offspring began writing new material for their next album. Frontman Dexter Holland told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in August 1998, &quot;I wanted to write a record that wasn&#x27;t a radical departure from what we&#x27;ve done before. I feel like we have managed to change stuff up from &quot;Ignition&quot; to &quot;Smash&quot; to &quot;Ixnay&quot;. We&#x27;re in a place where we more or less set the boundaries where we can do a lot of stuff without having to stretch it out farther ... and do a swing song or something.&quot;

Recording took place from July to September 1998 at Eldorado Recording Studios with producer Dave Jerden, who also produced &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;. Holland told &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;The idea wasn&#x27;t to reinvent the wheel. We expanded our horizons on our last record and that&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t feel like you have to be a completely different band on every record.&quot; While most songs are the regular punk rock the band popularized, others such as the Latino-influenced &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; and the psychedelic &quot;Pay the Man&quot; add variety, &quot;so that there&#x27;s enough in there so people don&#x27;t get bored&quot;. &quot;Pay the Man&quot; was even left off &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; for sounding too different from anything else the band had currently made at that time. The structure of the song more resembles progressive rock (having no repetitive sections and no continuous musical theme). Holland also contributed the song &quot;Too Much Drama&quot; to the Vandals&#x27; album &quot;Hitler Bad, Vandals Good&quot;, which was released five months before &quot;Americana&quot;. The chorus melody is reused on this album on the song &quot;Walla Walla&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Americana&quot; contains themes of unhappy American lifestyles. Speaking of the album shortly after its release, Holland explained, &quot;The songs on &quot;Americana&quot; aren&#x27;t condemnations, they&#x27;re short stories about the state of things and what we see going on around us. We want to expose the darker side of our culture. It may look like an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; out there in America, but it feels more like &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.&quot; He detailed that &quot;Americana&quot; was not thought right away as a concept album and &quot;this really cool social statement&quot;, though once the band recorded a few songs complaining about 1998 America, &quot;then we realized we had a theme&quot;.

Holland also explained that &quot;Americana &quot; served as &quot;a commentary on American culture&quot;, satirizing hypocritical lives and political correctness. One of the influences was &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, with the band even considering naming the album after the show&#x27;s news tickers such as &quot;Stripper Wars&quot;. A major source of inspiration was seeing the people in Holland&#x27;s hometown of Huntington Beach, such as the &quot;wiggers&quot; who were mocked in &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;. Despite dealing with aimlessness and disillusionment, derived from how the generation that had just got to adulthood was having problems in getting jobs and sustaining themselves, Holland declared that &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it to be a record that made you feel hopeless. At the end of the day I hope that you can get something positive out of it.&quot;

==Packaging==
Artist Frank Kozik was hired to do the artwork for the album, as Holland found that his concert tour posters &quot;had all the connotations we associated with &quot;Americana&quot;: very glossy, innocent and 1950s, but with a twisted aspect.&quot; Kozik, who had known the singer for a long time, was reluctant to work for the band due to the reception his fans would have, eventually demanding $75,000 to do the &quot;Americana&quot; illustrations. The album&#x27;s cover art features a blond boy with an orthopedic boot seated on a swing holding a sand flea. From out of the frame, a tentacle reaches toward the boy. Kozik had originally done said illustration for a Nebraskan band, Ritual Device, and reused it as the cover of his book &quot;Man&#x27;s Ruin: The Poster Art Of Frank Kozik&quot;. On the booklet, which Holland described as &quot;a little Kozik picture book&quot;, every song has its own accompanying illustration.

Some pressings of &quot;Americana&quot; are also enhanced CDs and contain the karaoke videos of &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Get a Job?&quot;, and the previous MTV music videos from its predecessor, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Americana&quot; was released on November 17, 1998, and peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, the highest position the band has attained as of 2023. Shortly after its release, the album was certified gold and then later platinum.

The album received mixed reviews. Michael Gallucci of AllMusic described the album as a &quot;raucous ride through America as seen through the eyes of a weary, but still optimistic, young kid&quot;. Gallucci praised the music as &quot;a hearty combination of poppy punk&quot; and a &quot;blend of salsa and alterna-rock sounds&quot;, stating the band&#x27;s music was taking a different direction. The album received a rating of three out of five stars, while &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Get a Job?&quot;, &quot;The Kids Aren&#x27;t Alright&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got Issues&quot; earned the Offspring its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Dan Snierson considered &quot;Americana&quot; as post-punk done right, &quot;with crafty yell-odies and winky lyrics&quot;. In his review for the Offspring&#x27;s next album &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; critic Stephen Thompson called &quot;Americana&quot; &quot;the unbearable result being the kind of stupidity that thinks it&#x27;s clever&quot;, considering it &quot;bad enough to create a backlash against not only pop-punk, but also novelty songs, guitars, smug thirtysomethings, and the human race.&quot;

&quot;Americana&quot; is the 224th best selling album of all time according to &quot;Billboard&quot; as of 2009. The album was included in &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 101 Modern Classics list at number 79. The album was included at number 23 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list. &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic&quot;.

The album was named at the 2000 Juno Awards as one of the best-selling albums that year.

==Track listing==
All songs written and composed by Dexter Holland, except where noted.
* &quot;Pay the Man&quot; ends at 8:10, followed by the hidden track &quot;Pretty Fly (Reprise)&quot; at 9:15. The track is a mariachi reprise of the song &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;. The online download release of &quot;Americana&quot; has &quot;Pay the Man&quot; and &quot;Pretty Fly (Reprise)&quot; separately, with the reprise as track 14. The main riff on &quot;Pay the Man&quot;, particularly the drum part, is the same as found on the title track of &quot;Smash&quot; during the acoustic version of &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;.

<doc id="517360" wikidata="Q6980429" url="?curid=517360" title="Natural Area Code">
<text>Natural Area Code, also called Universal Address, is a geocode generated by the Natural Area Coding System - a public domain geocode system for identifying an area (also a location when the area is relatively small enough) anywhere on the Earth, or a volume of space anywhere around and inside the Earth. The use of thirty alphanumeric characters instead of only ten digits makes a NAC shorter than its numerical latitude/longitude equivalent.

== Two-dimensional system ==
Instead of numerical longitudes and latitudes, a grid with 30 rows and 30 columns - each cell denoted by the numbers 0-9 and the twenty consonants of the Latin alphabet - is laid over the flattened globe. A NAC cell (or block) can be subdivided repeatedly into smaller NAC grids to yield an arbitrarily small area, subject to the ±1 m limitations of the World Geodetic System (WGS) data of 1984.

A NAC represents an area on the Earth—the longer the NAC, the smaller the area (and thereby, location) represented. A ten-character NAC can uniquely specify any building, house, or fixed object in the world. An eight-character NAC specifies an area no larger than 25 metres by 50 metres, while a ten-character NAC cell is no larger than 0.8 metres by 1.6 metres.

Using a base 30 positional numeral system, NAC uses an alternate method which excludes vowels and avoids potential confusion between &quot;0&quot; (zero) and &quot;O&quot; (capital &quot;o&quot;), and &quot;1&quot; (one) and &quot;I&quot; (capital &quot;i&quot;):

For example, the ten-character NAC for the centre of the city of Brussels is HBV6R RG77T.

== Extension to three dimensions ==
The full NAC system provides a third coordinate: altitude. This coordinate is the arctangent of the altitude, relative to the Earth&#x27;s radius, and scaled so that the zero point (000...) is at the centre of the Earth, the midpoint (H00...) is the local radius of the geoid, i.e. the Earth&#x27;s surface, and the endpoint (ZZZ...) is at infinity.

For example, the three-dimensional NAC for the centre of Brussels, at ground level, is HBV6R RG77T H0000.

<doc id="517367" wikidata="Q512410" url="?curid=517367" title="Qawwali">
<text>Qawwali is a form of Sufi Islamic devotional singing originating in India. Originally performed at Sufi shrines or dargahs throughout The Indian subcontinent, it is famous throughout Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and has also gained mainstream popularity and an international audience as of the late 20th century.

While hereditary performers continue to perform Qawwali music in traditional and devotional contexts, Qawwali has received international exposure through the work of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Aziz Mian and Sabri Brothers largely due to several releases on the Real World label, followed by live appearances at WOMAD festivals. Other famous Qawwali singers include Abida Parveen, Fareed Ayyaz &amp; Abu Muhammad, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Badar Miandad, Rizwan &amp; Moazzam Duo, Qutbi Brothers, the late Amjad Sabri, Wadali Brothers, Nizami Bandhu, Bahauddin Qutbuddin, Aziz Naza, among others. Most modern Qawwali singers belong to the famed &#x27;Qawwal Bachon ka Gharana&#x27; school of Qawwali, which was based in Delhi before 1947 and migrated to Pakistan after the Partition of British India.

==Terminology==
&quot;Qawl&quot; () is an &quot;utterance (of the prophet)&quot;, Qawwāl is someone who often repeats (sings) a Qaul, Qawwāli is what a Qawwāl sings.

==Origins==

Delhi&#x27;s Sufi saint Amir Khusrow of the Chisti order of Sufis is credited with fusing the Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Indian traditions in the late 13th century in India to create Qawwali as we know it today. The word &quot;sama&quot; is often still used in Central Asia and Turkey to refer to forms very similar to Qawwali, and in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, the formal name used for a session of Qawwali is &quot;Mehfil-e-Sama&quot;.

Originally, musical instrument use in Qawwali was prohibited. The following conditions were initially placed on Qawwali:
Sufi Saints such as Nizamuddin Auliya, the teacher of the famous Sufi singer Amir Khusrow, were quite blunt about the prohibition:
Eventually, however, musical instrument use found its way into Qawwali. Instruments such as the harmonium, tabla and dholak are now common in many Qawwali parties.

== Historical practice and training ==
Traditional qawwali practice is built upon a system of hereditary training, in which qawwals are part of the service community connected to a particular shrine. Their primary function to the shrine is to service formal activities, primarily the death anniversaries of Sufi saints (&quot;Urs&quot;).

Since the intention of qawwali is to act as a bridge toward the experience of Sufi mystical love and builds upon religious chants and chanted poetry, the practice is viewed as permissible in what Islamic scholar Lois Lamya al-Faruqi refers to as non-musiqa. Qawwals themselves are central figures within qawwali ritual but are not regarded as the focus and are still regarded as part of the servant class.

Qawwals are trained in two primary ways: (1) as part of a &quot;bradri&quot; or brotherhood of performers in which they learn the fundamentals of the music, and (2) within Sufic teaching circles typically reserved for the higher classes in which they learn about Sufism. The understanding of the spiritual aspects but also the form&#x27;s reliance on poetry requires a level of literacy in order to fulfill the role.

==Qawwali repertory==
Ethnomusicologist Regula Qureshi distinguishes between &quot;old&quot; tunes (purānī dhuneṅ, purānī bandisheṅ) and &quot;tunes of nowadays&quot; (ājkal kī dhuneṅ). The &quot;old&quot; tune repertory includes movable tunes that can be adapted to multiple poems as well as &quot;special&quot; (makhsūs, khās) settings of poems, which are identified by their text. Qureshi also includes &quot;typical Qawwal tunes&quot; (Qawwālī kī thet dhunen) in this category, referring to tunes that can be used for a variety of poems based on the music&#x27;s structural features.
The songs which constitute the qawwali repertoire are primarily in Persian, Urdu, and Hindi, although Sufi poetry appears in local languages as well (including Punjabi, Saraiki, and dialects of northern India like Braj Bhasha and Awadhi.) The sound of regional language qawwali can be totally different from that of mainstream qawwali, as in the case of Chhote Babu Qawwal, whose style of singing is much closer to the Bengali Baul music than to the qawwali of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, for example.

The central themes of qawwali are love, devotion and longing for the Divine. The Sufi poets whose texts have made up the qawwali repertory often used worldly images to convey mystic spiritual love. As such, it is not uncommon to see mentions of worldly or forbidden concepts such as romantic longing, wine, and drunkenness, which are used as metaphors for the mystic state. Qawwals bear the responsibility of maintaining a spiritually appropriate context for such songs, so as not to distract from the religious focus of the Qawwali occasion.

Qawwali songs are classified by their content into several categories:
* A Qaul, Arabic for &#x27;saying,&#x27; is a basic ritual song of Sufism in India, often used as an opening or closing hymn for a Qawwali occasion. The texts contain sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (hence the form&#x27;s name), and they form an obligatory part of the Qawwali occasion. The Qaul may be followed by one or more obligatory hymns that refer to the founding saint of a given Sufi lineage.
* A hamd (حمد), Arabic for &#x27;praise,&#x27; is a song (or poem) in praise of Allah. A hamd traditionally begins the thematic sequence of songs in a Qawwali occasion (after the obligatory hymns).
* A na`at (نعت), Arabic for &#x27;description,&#x27; is a song (or poem) in praise of Muhammad. The hamd is traditionally followed by a na`at.
* A manqabat (plural manaqib, مناقب, which means &#x27;characteristics&#x27;) is a song in praise of either Imam Ali or one of the Sufi saints. Manaqib in praise of Ali are sung at both Sunni and Shi&#x27;a gatherings. If one is sung, it will follow right after the na`at. There is usually at least one manqabat in a traditional program.
* A marsiya (مرثية), Arabic for &#x27;lamentation for a dead person&#x27;, is a lamentation over the death of much of Imam Husayn&#x27;s family in the Battle of Karbala. This would typically be sung only at a Shi&#x27;a gathering.
* A ghazal (غزل), Arabic for &#x27;love song&#x27; and based on the poetic genre of the same name, is a song made up of thematically independent couplets in Farsi or Urdu. The ghazal is found in the majority of qawwali songs, and has been considered an ideal form for the mystical experience because its emphasis on repetition allows a qawwal to reiterate a central theme or phrase, which can be used as a way to engage in dhikr. To create a sense of thematic unity, ghazals often draw from conventional metaphors, imagery, and topics throughout the form, such as themes of unrequited love, separation from (or reunion with) the beloved, the beauty of nature, and consuming wine. In the context of , these songs of yearning and intoxication use secular metaphors to poignantly express mystical concepts like the soul&#x27;s longing for union with the Divine and its joy in loving the Divine. Intoxication is understood as a metaphor for attaining spiritual knowledge, or being filled with the joy of loving the Divine. In the songs of yearning, the scorned lover becomes a metaphor for the soul that has been abandoned in this world by God and longs for reunion. While ghazals take on a specifically devotional context in qawwali performance, the form exists beyond devotional music, constituting a distinct secular musical genre in Pakistan and India where the poetry&#x27;s worldly themes may be taken at face value.
* A kafi is a poem in Punjabi, Seraiki or Sindhi, which is in the unique style of poets such as Sultan Bahoo, Shah Hussain, Bulleh Shah and Sachal Sarmast. Two of the more well-known Kafis include &quot;Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal&quot; and &quot;Mera Piya Ghar Aaya&quot;.
* A munajaat (مناجاة), Arabic for a conversation in the night or a form of prayer, is a song where the singer displays his thanks to Allah through a variety of linguistic techniques. It is often sung in Persian, with Mawlana Jalāl-ad-Dīn Rumi credited as its author.

==Composition of a qawwali party==
A group of qawwali musicians, called a &quot;party&quot; (or Humnawa in Urdu), typically consists of eight or nine men including a lead singer, one or two side singers, one or two harmoniums (which may be played by the lead singer, side singer or someone else), and percussion. If there is only one percussionist, he plays the tabla and dholak, usually the tabla with the dominant hand and the dholak with the other one (i.e. a left-handed percussionist would play the tabla with his left hand). Often there will be two percussionists, in which case one might play the tabla and the other the dholak. There is also a chorus of four or five men who repeat key verses, and who aid percussion by hand-clapping.

The performers sit cross-legged on the ground in two rows — the lead singer, side singers and harmonium players in the front row, and the chorus and percussionists in the back row.

Before the fairly recent introduction of the harmonium, qawwalis were usually accompanied by the sarangi. The sarangi had to be retuned between songs; the harmonium didn&#x27;t, and was soon preferred.

Women used to be excluded from traditional Muslim music, since they are traditionally prohibited from singing in the presence of men. These traditions have changed, however, as is evident by the popularity (and acceptance) of female singers such as Abida Parveen. However, qawwali has remained a predominantly male business and there are still not many mainstream female qawwals.

==Musical structure of Qawwali==
The longest recorded commercially released qawwali runs slightly over 115 minutes (Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga by Aziz Mian Qawwal). The qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has at least two songs that are more than 60 minutes long.

Qawwalis tend to begin gently and build steadily to a very high energy level in order to induce hypnotic states both among the musicians and within the audience. Almost all Qawwalis are based on a Raga from the Hindustani classical music tradition. Songs are usually arranged as follows:

# They start with an instrumental prelude where the main melody is played on the harmonium, accompanied by the tabla, and which may include improvised variations of the melody.
# Then comes the alap, a long tonal improvised melody during which the singers intone different long notes, in the raga of the song to be played.
# The lead singer begins to sing some preamble verses which are typically not part of the main song, although thematically related to it. These are sung unrhythmically, improvised following the raga, and accompanied only by the harmonium. After the lead singer sings a verse, one of the side singers will repeat the verse, perhaps with his own improvisation. A few or many verses will be sung in this way, leading into the main song.
# As the main song begins, the tabla, dholak and clapping begin. All members join in the singing of the verses that constitute the refrain. The lyrics of the main verses are never improvised; in fact, these are often traditional songs sung by many groups, especially within the same lineage. However, the tunes are subtly improvised within the framework of the main melody. As the song proceeds, the lead singer or one of the side singers may break out into an alap. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan also popularised the interjection of sargam singing at this point. The song usually builds in tempo and passion, with each singer trying to outdo the other in terms of vocal acrobatics. Some singers may do long periods of sargam improvisation, especially alternating improvisations with a student singer. The songs usually end suddenly.

The singing style of qawwali is different from Western singing styles in many ways. For example, in words beginning with an &quot;m&quot;, Western singers are apt to stress the vowel following the &quot;m&quot; rather than the &quot;m&quot; itself, whereas in qawwali, the &quot;m&quot; will usually be held, producing a muted tone. Also in qawwali, there is no distinction between what is known as the chest voice and the head voice (the different areas that sound will resonate in depending on the frequency sung). Rather, qawwals sing very loudly and forcefully, which allows them to extend their chest voice to much higher frequencies than those used in Western singing, even though this usually causes a more noisy or strained sound than what would be acceptable in the West.

<text>The French School of the Far East (, ; also translated as The French School of Asian Studies), abbreviated EFEO, is an associated college of PSL University dedicated to the study of Asian societies. It was founded on 20 January 1900 with headquarters in Hanoi in what was then Tonkin protectorate of French Indochina. After the independence of Vietnam, its headquarters were transferred to Phnom Penh in 1957, and subsequently to Paris in 1975. Its main fields of research are archaeology, philology and the study of modern Asian societies. Since 1907, the EFEO has been in charge of conservation work at the archeological site of Angkor.

Paul Mus was a member of EFEO since 1927, and &quot;returned to Hanoi in 1927 as a secretary and librarian with the Research Institute of the French School of the Far East until 1940.&quot;

== EFEO romanization system ==

A romanization system for Mandarin was developed by the EFEO. It shares a few similarities with Wade-Giles and Hanyu Pinyin. In modern times, it has been superseded by Hanyu Pinyin.

The differences between the three romanization systems are shown in the following table:
==Directors==
*1900: Louis Finot
*1905: Alfred Foucher
*1908: 
*1920: Louis Finot
*1926:

*1998: Jean-Pierre Drège
*2004: Franciscus Verellen
*2014: Yves Goudineau
*2018: Christophe Marquet
*2022: Nicolas Fiévé

== Publications ==
The catalog of EFEO Publications, of some 600 titles, includes works on a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences (archaeology, history, anthropology, literature, philology, etc.), centered on Asia, from India to Japan. These publications are directed at specialists and a wider public interested in Asian civilizations and societies.

The EFEO in publishes five scholarly journals on an annual or twice-yearly basis:
*&quot;Bulletin de l&#x27;École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient&quot; – BEFEO (Bulletin of the French School of Asian Studies), published since 1901
*&quot;Arts Asiatiques&quot; (Asian Arts), published jointly with the Musée Guimet and the CNRS
*&quot;Cahiers d&#x27;Extrême-Asie&quot; (East Asian Journal), published in Kyoto
*&quot;Aséanie&quot; (Southeast Asian Studies), published in Bangkok
*&quot;Sinologie française&quot; [S: 法国汉学, T: 法國漢學, P: &quot;Fǎguó Hànxué&quot;] (French Sinology), published in Chinese in Beijing

<doc id="517371" wikidata="Q492663" url="?curid=517371" title="Jesus and the woman taken in adultery">
<text>Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (or the ) is considered by many to be a pseudepigraphical passage (pericope) found in John 7:53–8:11 of the New Testament.

In the passage, Jesus was teaching in the Temple after coming from the Mount of Olives. A group of scribes and Pharisees confronts Jesus, interrupting his teaching. They bring in a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she was caught in the very act. They tell Jesus that the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by Mosaic Law. Jesus begins to write something on the ground using his finger; when the woman&#x27;s accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone at her. The accusers depart, realizing not one of them is without sin either, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her and she answers no. Jesus says that he too does not condemn her and tells her to go and sin no more.

There is now a broad academic consensus that the passage is a later interpolation added after the earliest known manuscripts of the Gospel of John. However, that does not necessarily mean that the episode is not historical, as the Early Church Fathers mention similar versions of it. It was likely saved through oral tradition. Although it is included in most modern translations (one notable exception being the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures) it is typically noted as a later interpolation, as it is by Novum Testamentum Graece NA28. This has been the view of &quot;most NT scholars, including most &quot;evangelical&quot; NT scholars, for well over a century&quot; (written in 2009). However, its originality has been defended by a minority of scholars who believe in the Byzantine priority hypothesis. The passage appears to have been included in some texts by the 4th century and became generally accepted by the 5th century.

==The passage==
John 7:53–8:11 in the New Revised Standard Version reads as follows:

==Interpretation==
This episode and its message of mercy and forgiveness balanced with a call to holy living have endured in Christian thought. Both &quot;let him who is without sin cast the first stone&quot; and &quot;go, and sin no more&quot; have found their way into common usage. The English idiomatic phrase to &quot;&quot; is derived from this passage.

The passage has been taken as confirmation of Jesus&#x27;s ability to write, otherwise only suggested by implication in the Gospels, but the word (&quot;egraphen&quot;) in John 8:8 could mean &quot;draw&quot; as well as &quot;write&quot;.

==History of textual criticism==
The first to systematically apply the critical marks of the Alexandrian critics was Origen:

Early textual critics familiar with the use and meaning of these marks in classical Greek works like Homer, interpreted the signs to mean that the section (John 7:53–8:11) was an interpolation and not an original part of the Gospel.

During the 16th century, Western European scholars – both Catholic and Protestant – sought to recover the most correct Greek text of the New Testament, rather than relying on the Vulgate Latin translation. At this time, it was noticed that a number of early manuscripts containing the Gospel of John lacked John 7:53–8:11 inclusive; and also that some manuscripts containing the verses marked them with critical signs, usually a lemniscus or asterisk. It was also noted that, in the lectionary of the Greek church, the Gospel-reading for Pentecost runs from John 7:37 to 8:12, but skips over the twelve verses of this pericope.

Beginning with Karl Lachmann (in Germany, 1840), reservations about the became more strongly argued in the modern period, and these opinions were carried into the English world by Samuel Davidson (1848–51), Samuel Prideaux Tregelles (1862), and others; the argument against the verses being given body and final expression in F. J. A. Hort (1886). Those opposing the authenticity of the verses as part of John are represented in the 20th century by men like Henry Cadbury (1917), Ernest Cadman Colwell (1935), and Bruce M. Metzger (1971).

19th-century text critics Henry Alford and F. H. A. Scrivener suggested that the passage was added by John in a second edition of the Gospel along with 5:3.4 and the 21st chapter.

A number of scholars have strongly defended the Johannine authorship of these verses. This group of critics is typified by such scholars as Frederick Nolan (1865), and John Burgon (1886), and Herman C. Hoskier (1920). More recently it has been defended by David Otis Fuller (1975), and is included in the Greek New Testaments compiled by Wilbur Pickering (1980/2014), Hodges &amp; Farstad (1982/1985), and Robinson &amp; Pierpont (2005). Rather than endorsing Augustine&#x27;s theory that some men had removed the passage due to a concern that it would be used by their wives as a pretext to commit adultery, Burgon proposed a theory that the passage had been lost due to a misunderstanding of a feature in the lection-system of the early church.

Almost all modern critical translations that include the pericope adulterae do so at John 7:53–8:11. Exceptions include the New English Bible and Revised English Bible, which relocate the pericope after the end of the Gospel. Most others enclose the pericope in brackets, or add a footnote mentioning the absence of the passage in the oldest witnesses (e.g., NRSV, NJB, NIV, GNT, NASB, ESV). Since the passage is accepted as canonical by Catholics, however, some Catholic editions of these critical translations will remove the brackets while retaining the footnote explanation of their uncertainty (e.g. RSV-CE/2CE and ESV-CE); others, like the NRSV-CE, nevertheless retain the brackets.

== Textual history ==
The pericope does not occur in the Greek Gospel manuscripts from Egypt. The Pericope Adulterae is not in 𝔓66 or in 𝔓75, both of which have been assigned to the late 100s or early 200s, nor in two important manuscripts produced in the early or mid 300s, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus. The first surviving Greek manuscript to contain the pericope is the Latin-Greek diglot Codex Bezae, produced in the 400s or 500s (but displaying a form of text which has affinities with &quot;Western&quot; readings used in the 100s and 200s). Codex Bezae is also the earliest surviving Latin manuscript to contain it. Out of 23 Old Latin manuscripts of John 7–8, seventeen contain at least part of the pericope, and represent at least three transmission-streams in which it was included.

=== Eastern Christianity ===
According to Eusebius of Caesarea (in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, composed in the early 300s), Papias () refers to a story of Jesus and a woman &quot;accused of many sins&quot; as being found in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which might refer to this passage or to one like it. However, according to the later writer Agapius of Hierapolis, Papias wrote a treatise on the Gospel of John, where he included the story within the Gospel itself. Possibly the earliest evidence for the existence of the pericope adulterae within the Gospel of John is from the 2nd century Protoevangelium of James, which contains the words &quot;οὐδὲ ἐγὼ [κατα]κρίνω ὑμᾶς&quot; (neither do I condemn you) in Greek, which are identical to the text of John 8:11. Other parallels between this story within Protoevangelium and the Johannine pericope adulterae include: (1) a woman is accused of adultery, (2) the accusation is made by the Jews, (3) the woman is brought by a crowd to stand before a religious figure, (4) the accused woman is presented to the judge for a ruling and (5) both accounts are a part of a &quot;confrontation story&quot;. However, it is not certain if the author borrowed directly from the Gospel of John or from a now-unknown document such as the Gospel according to the Hebrews.

In the Syriac , composed in the mid-200s, the author, in the course of instructing bishops to exercise a measure of clemency, states that a bishop who does not receive a repentant person would be doing wrong – &quot;for you do not obey our Savior and our God, to do as He also did with her that had sinned, whom the elders set before Him, and leaving the judgment in His hands, departed. But He, the searcher of hearts, asked her and said to her, &#x27;Have the elders condemned thee, my daughter?&#x27; She said to Him, &#x27;No, Lord.&#x27; And He said unto her, &#x27;Go your way; neither do I condemn thee.&#x27; In Him therefore, our Savior and King and God, be your pattern, O bishops.&quot; The &quot;Constitutions of the Holy Apostles&quot; Book II.24, composed , echoes the , alongside a utilization of Luke 7:47. Further, Didymus the Blind (c. 313–398) states that &quot;We find in certain gospels&quot; an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened &quot;and said to those who were about to cast stones, &#x27;He who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it. If anyone is conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.&#x27; And no one dared,&quot; and so forth. It is also shortly mentioned by the 6th century author of the Greek treatise &quot;Synopsis Scripturae Sacrae&quot;. Among the early Greek attestations of the pericope adulterae are the 6th century canon tables found in the Monastery of Epiphanus in Egypt. Although fragmentary, the manuscript likely contained the story of the adulteress and contained its own section number. Evidence of its existence within some Egyptian manuscripts additionally comes from two ivory pyxides dated to around the 5th or 6th century, which depict the story of the adulteress.

Within the Syriac tradition, the anonymous author of the 6th century Syriac Chronicle, called Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor mentioned the translation of the pericope Adulterae into Aramaic from a Greek manuscript from Alexandria. The story of the adulteress is also found in manuscripts of the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary, including MS &quot;A&quot; (1030ad), MS &quot;C&quot; (1118ad) and MS &quot;B&quot; (1104ad). 

An author by the name of &quot;Nicon&quot; wrote a treatise called &quot;On the Impious Religion of the Vile Armenians&quot;, in which he argued that the Armenian Christians tried to remove the passage from their manuscripts. This has been often attributed to the 10th century author Nicon, however Wescott and Hort argued that it is a later 13th century Nicon. They argued that this writing was made in response to the claims of Vardan Areveltsi, who stated that Papias is responsible for the inclusion of the story in the Gospel of John. Later on, in the 12th century the passage was mentioned by Euthymius Zigabenus, who doubted the authenticity of the passage. However, his contemporary Eustathios of Thessaloniki commented on the passage as an authentic part of John&#x27;s Gospel.

=== Western Christianity ===
The story of the adulteress was quoted by multiple Latin speaking early Christians, and appears within their quotations of the New Testament often. It is quoted by church fathers such as Hilary of Poitiers, Gregory the Great, Leo the Great, Ambrose, Ambrosiaster and Augustine among many others. However, it is not quoted by either Tertullian or Cyprian, which might imply that it was missing from their manuscripts. The story is present in the vast majority of Vetus Latina manuscripts and in all except one manuscript of the Latin Vulgate. 

Pacian of Barcelona (bishop from 365 to 391), in the course of making a rhetorical challenge, opposes cruelty as he sarcastically endorses it: &quot;O Novatians, why do you delay to ask an eye for an eye? [...] Kill the thief. Stone the petulant. Choose not to read in the Gospel that the Lord spared even the adulteress who confessed, when none had condemned her.&quot; Pacian was a contemporary of the scribes who made Codex Sinaiticus.

The writer known as Ambrosiaster, , mentioned the occasion when Jesus &quot;spared her who had been apprehended in adultery.&quot; The unknown author of the composition &quot;Apologia David&quot; (thought by some analysts to be Ambrose, but more probably not) mentioned that people could be initially taken aback by the passage in which &quot;we see an adulteress presented to Christ and sent away without condemnation.&quot; Later in the same composition he referred to this episode as a &quot;lection&quot; in the Gospels, indicating that it was part of the annual cycle of readings used in the church-services.

Peter Chrysologus, writing in Ravenna , clearly cited the in his Sermon 115. Sedulius and Gelasius also clearly used the passage. Prosper of Aquitaine, and Quodvultdeus of Carthage, in the mid-400s, utilized the passage.

The Latin Vulgate Gospel of John, produced by Jerome in 383, was based on the Greek manuscripts which Jerome considered ancient exemplars at that time and which contained the passage. Jerome, writing around 417, reports that the was found in its usual place in &quot;many Greek and Latin manuscripts&quot; in Rome and the Latin West. This is confirmed by some Latin Fathers of the 300s and 400s, including Ambrose of Milan, and Augustine of Hippo. The latter claimed that the passage may have been improperly excluded from some manuscripts in order to avoid the impression that Christ had sanctioned adultery:

Codex Fuldensis, which was produced in AD 546, and which, in the Gospels, features an unusual arrangement of the text that was found in an earlier document, contains the adulterae pericope, in the form in which it was written in the Vulgate. More significantly, Codex Fuldensis also preserves the chapter-headings of its earlier source-document (thought by some researchers to echo the Diatessaron produced by Tatian in the 170&#x27;s), and the title of chapter 120 refers specifically to the woman taken in adultery.

The subject of Jesus&#x27;s writing on the ground was fairly common in art, especially from the Renaissance onwards, with examples by artists including a painting by Pieter Bruegel and a drawing by Rembrandt. There was a medieval tradition, originating in a comment attributed to Ambrose, that the words written were (&quot;earth accuses earth&quot;; a reference to the end of verse Genesis 3:19: &quot;for dust you are and to dust you will return&quot;), which is shown in some depictions in art, for example, the &quot;Codex Egberti&quot;.

==Manuscripts==
Both the (NA28) and the United Bible Societies (UBS4) provide critical text for the pericope, but mark this off with double square brackets, indicating that the is regarded as a later addition to the text.

Various manuscripts treat, or include, the passage in a variety of ways. These can be categorised into those that exclude it entirely, those that exclude only a shortened version of the passage (including 7:53-8:2 but excluding 8:3-11), those that include only a shortened version of the passage (8:3–11), those that include the passage in full, those that question the passage, those that question only the shorter passage, those that relocate it to a different place within the Gospel of John, and those that mark it as having been added by a later hand.

#Added by a later hand: Codex Ebnerianus (Min. 105), Codex Rehdigeranus (&quot;l&quot;, VL11), 19, 284, 431, 391, 461, 470, 501 (8:3-11), 578, 794, 1141, 1357, 1593, 2174, 2244, 2860, MS 14470 (added in the 9th century by a later scribe).
#Lacuna: Codex Regius (L) (8th century) and Codex Sangallensis (Δ) (9th century) contain a large gap after John 7:52, thus indicating possible knowledge of the passage despite being omitted.

The was never read as a part of the lesson for the Pentecost cycle, but John 8:3–8:11 was reserved for the festivals of such saints as Theodora, 18 September, or Pelagia, 8 October.

==Authorship==
===Arguments against Johannine authorship===
Bishop J. B. Lightfoot wrote that absence of the passage from the earliest manuscripts, combined with the occurrence of stylistic characteristics atypical of John, together implied that the passage was an interpolation. Nevertheless, he considered the story to be authentic history. As a result, based on Eusebius&#x27; mention that the writings of Papias contained a story &quot;about a woman falsely accused before the Lord of many sins&quot; (H.E. 3.39), he argued that this section originally was part of Papias&#x27; &quot;Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord&quot;, and included it in his collection of Papias&#x27; fragments. Bart D. Ehrman concurs in &quot;Misquoting Jesus&quot;, adding that the passage contains many words and phrases otherwise alien to John&#x27;s writing. The evangelical Bible scholar Daniel B. Wallace agrees with Ehrman.

There are several excerpts from other authors that are consistent with this:
Fragment 1 (Eusebius - 4th century):
 And he relates another story of a woman, who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is contained in the Gospel according to the Hebrews. These things we have thought it necessary to observe in addition to what has been already stated. 
Fragment 2 (Agapius of Hierapolis - 10th century):
 And there was at that time in Menbij [Hierapolis] a distinguished master who had many treatises, and he wrote five treatises on the Gospel. And he mentions in his treatise on the Gospel of John, that in the book of John the Evangelist, he speaks of a woman who was adulterous, so when they presented her to Christ our Lord, to whom be glory, He told the Jews who brought her to Him, “Whoever of you knows that he is innocent of what she has done, let him testify against her with what he has.” So when He told them that, none of them responded with anything and they left.
Fragment 3 (Vardan Areveltsi - 13th century):
 The story of that adulterous woman, which other Christians have written in their gospel, was written about by a certain Papias, a student of John, who was declared a heretic and condemned. Eusebius wrote about this. There are laws and that matter which Pilate, the king of the Jews, wrote of. And it is said that he wrote in Hebrew with Latin and Greek above it.

However, Michael W. Holmes says that it is not certain &quot;that Papias knew the story in precisely this form, inasmuch as it now appears that at least two independent stories about Jesus and a sinful woman circulated among Christians in the first two centuries of the church, so that the traditional form found in many New Testament manuscripts may well represent a conflation of two independent shorter, earlier versions of the incident.&quot; Kyle R. Hughes has argued that one of these earlier versions is in fact very similar in style, form, and content to the Lukan special material (the so-called &quot;L&quot; source), suggesting that the core of this tradition is in fact rooted in very early Christian (though not Johannine) memory.

===Arguments for Johannine authorship===
The story of the adulteress has been defended by those who teach the Byzantine priority theory and also by those who defend the superiority of the Textus Receptus. Among these, Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L. Farstad argue for Johannine authorship of the pericope. They suggest there are points of similarity between the pericope&#x27;s style and the style of the rest of the gospel. They claim that the details of the encounter fit very well into the context of the surrounding verses. They argue that the pericope&#x27;s appearance in the majority of manuscripts, if not in the oldest ones, is evidence of its authenticity. Biblical scholar Maurice Robinson argued that the anomalies in the transmission of the Pericope Adulterae may be explained by the Lectionary system, where due to the Pericope Adulterae being skipped during the Pentecost lesson, some scribes would relocate the story to not intervene with the flow of the Pentecost lesson. He also argued that mistakes arising from the Lectionary system are able to explain the omission of the story in some manuscripts.

== Status in the Bible ==
According to , &quot;the question of the &quot;Pericope Adulterae&quot;&#x27;s canonicity does not follow automatically from a literary historical judgment about its origin.&quot; The Catholic Church regards it as canonical, following the precepts of the Council of Trent. Many Protestants reject it as non-canonical. From a Protestant point of view, Baum argues that its canonicity can be &quot;determined according to the same historical and content-related criteria that the ancient church applied during the development of the canon of Scriptures.&quot; He further argues, however, that it should be separated from the Gospel of John.

== Art and culture ==
The story is the subject of several paintings, including:

* &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot;, a series of works by Lucas Cranach the Elder and the Younger (1520-1560)
* &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot; by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1565)
* &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens (1614)
* &quot;The Woman Taken in Adultery&quot; by Rembrandt (1644)
* &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot; by Mattia Preti (c. 1650)
* &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (He That Is Without Sin?)&quot; by Vasily Polenov (1888)
* &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot; by Max Beckmann (1917)
* &quot;Christ with the Adulteress&quot; by Han van Meegeren (1942), but sold as an original Vermeer

Variations of the story are told in the 1986 science fiction novel &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; by Orson Scott Card, as part of &quot;Letters to an Incipient Heretic&quot; by the character San Angelo.

===Chinese distortion===
In September 2020, the Chinese textbook(&quot;Professional Ethics and Law&quot;) was alleged to inaccurately recount the story with a changed narrative in which Jesus stones the woman, while stating &quot;I too am a sinner. But if the law could only be executed by men without blemish, the law would be dead.&quot; The publisher claims that this was an inauthentic, unauthorized publication of its textbook.

<text>In rhetoric, a pericope (; Greek , &quot;a cutting-out&quot;) is a set of verses that forms one coherent unit or thought, suitable for public reading from a text, now usually of sacred scripture.

==Description==

The term can also be used as a way to identify certain themes in a chapter of sacred text. Its importance is mainly felt in, but not limited to, narrative portions of Sacred Scripture (as well as poetic sections).

Manuscripts—often illuminated—called pericopes, are normally evangeliaries, that is, abbreviated Gospel Books only containing the sections of the Gospels required for the Masses of the liturgical year. Notable examples, both Ottonian, are the Pericopes of Henry II and the Salzburg Pericopes.

Lectionaries are normally made up of pericopes containing the Epistle and Gospel readings for the liturgical year. A pericope consisting of passages from different parts of a single book, or from different books of the Bible, and linked together into a single reading is called a &quot;&quot; or &quot;composite reading&quot;.

<doc id="517376" wikidata="Q509799" url="?curid=517376" title="The Boondock Saints">
<text>The Boondock Saints is a 1999 vigilante action thriller film written and directed by Troy Duffy in his feature directorial debut. Starring Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, David Della Rocco, and Billy Connolly, the film follows Irish fraternal twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus (Flanery and Reedus), who become vigilantes after killing two members of the Russian mafia in self defense. After both experience an epiphany, the twins, together with their best friend &quot;Funny Man&quot; Rocco (Rocco), set out on a mission to rid Boston of the criminal underworld in the name of God, all the while being pursued by FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Dafoe).

Duffy, who had never written a screenplay before, said he was inspired by personal experience while living with his brother Taylor in Los Angeles. Initially regarded as one of the hottest scripts in Hollywood, the film had a troubled production. Miramax Films dropped the project in 1997 before Franchise Pictures acquired the rights the following year. Principal photography began in Boston and Toronto on August 10, 1998, and concluded on September 26.

The theatrical release of &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; was significantly affected by the Columbine High School massacre, which had taken place just two weeks before test screenings. Amidst concerns that the film would inspire copycat crimes, it was given a limited release in only five theaters across the United States on January 21, 2000. Consequently, the film was a box office failure and received negative reviews from critics, with criticism aimed at its perceived glorification of vigilante justice and violence. Despite this, &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; became a cult classic through word of mouth and its home video release, ultimately grossing $50 million in sales.

A successful 2006 theatrical rerelease led to a sequel, &quot;The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day&quot; (2009), with Flanery, Reedus, Connolly, and Rocco reprising their roles, and Dafoe making an uncredited cameo appearance. &quot;Overnight&quot; (2003), a documentary about the making of the film, was also released. A third film is currently in development, with Flanery and Reedus expected to return.

==Plot==

In Boston, Irish American fraternal twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus attend Mass, where the priest mentions the fate of Kitty Genovese. Later, while Connor and Murphy are celebrating Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day with friends, three Russian mobsters arrive and try to shut down the pub so they can demolish it for the valuable land underneath. Despite Connor and Murphy&#x27;s attempt to talk them down, a brawl ensues, in which the Russians are defeated and humiliated. The next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge, the brothers beat them to death in self-defense.

FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case and finds that the police and the press see the MacManus twins as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After the twins retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive a &quot;calling&quot; from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.

Connor learns that a local hotel is hosting a meeting of the Russian mob. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from an underground gun dealer, the twins kill nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the twins and errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe &quot;Papa Joe&quot; Yakavetta, surprises them after being sent by his boss to carry out a hit. Realizing that he was set up, Rocco agrees to help Connor and Murphy. That night, they hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lapazzi, Papa Joe&#x27;s underboss, at a peep show.

Falsely believing that Rocco is behind the murders, Papa Joe hires the legendary hitman, &quot;Il Duce&quot;, to deal with the problem. Rocco takes revenge on his former crew and convinces the twins to shoot up a gambling den so he can execute a criminal he was once forced to assist in a heinous crime. The three men are then ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to escape, the three men suffer serious wounds, including the loss of Rocco&#x27;s finger.

Hours later, as the police secure the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the twins covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia. However, Smecker happens upon Rocco&#x27;s finger and analyzes it, eventually tracing the clues back to Rocco and his allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult conundrum; he struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men or join them in their cause as he believes they are doing the right thing. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently taking advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.

Later, the twins and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to assassinate Papa Joe at his mansion, but Smecker learns that they are walking into a trap. The twins are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe. As Papa Joe leaves, Smecker arrives disguised as a prostitute and tries to rescue them before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. While the twins say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer – revealing he is the twins&#x27; father and deciding to join his sons in their mission.

Three months later, Papa Joe is on trial for the third time. However, the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal. The twins and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, Dolly, Duffy and Greenly, infiltrate the courthouse and take the spectators hostage. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and publicly executing Papa Joe. The media dubs the three as &quot;the Saints&quot;.

==Cast==

* Willem Dafoe as Paul Smecker, a brilliant but emotionally troubled FBI special agent assigned to the murders linked to the MacManus twins.
* Sean Patrick Flanery as Connor MacManus, one-half of the MacManus twins. He has a tattoo on his left hand that reads &quot;Veritas&quot; (&quot;truth&quot; in Latin).

==Production==
Troy Duffy&#x27;s screenplay was inspired by his disgust at seeing a drug dealer taking money from a corpse across the hall from his apartment. Duffy, who was working as a bartender and bouncer, had never written a screenplay before.

Duffy completed the screenplay in fall of 1996 and passed it to a producer&#x27;s assistant at New Line Cinema to be read by a senior executive. The screenplay changed hands through multiple studios and Duffy was approached by multiple producers for the rights. In March 1997, he was contracted by Paramount Pictures for $500,000, and later in the month, Miramax Films won a bidding war to buy &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;. The studio offered $450,000 to Duffy to write and direct the film. The documentary &quot;Overnight&quot; (2003), which chronicled Duffy&#x27;s &quot;rags-to-riches-to-rags&quot; story, showed that the script was worth $300,000, and the film itself was originally given a $15 million budget by Miramax&#x27;s Harvey Weinstein. Duffy&#x27;s band &quot;The Brood&quot; would do the soundtrack, and as a bonus, Miramax offered to buy and throw in co-ownership of J. Sloan&#x27;s, where Duffy worked. &quot;Overnight&quot; showed that Duffy frequently exhibited abrasive behavior, causing tension for many people involved in the project. Filming of &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; was scheduled for the coming autumn in Boston.

===Casting and funding===
Duffy sought to cast Stephen Dorff and Mark Wahlberg as the brothers, though Wahlberg passed for &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997). The director also wanted to cast Billy Connolly and Kenneth Branagh in the film, with Branagh playing FBI Agent Paul Smecker. Duffy also expressed interest in casting Brendan Fraser, Nicky Katt, and Ewan McGregor, with two of them as the brothers, but no decisions were finalized. The director later sought Patrick Swayze to play Smecker, but Miramax preferred Sylvester Stallone (with whom the studio had an existing relationship), Bill Murray, or Mike Myers. Kevin Spacey and Robert De Niro were also considered for the role of Smecker. Before pre-production work was supposed to begin in Boston in December 1997, Miramax pulled out of the project. Producer Lloyd Segan said that the project had stalled because of casting and location problems. While Duffy was able to keep the writer&#x27;s fee of $300,000, the studio required the reimbursement of the $150,000 director&#x27;s fee and the $700,000 advance to develop the project.

The independent studio Franchise Pictures sought to finance the project once other elements were in place. Duffy approached Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus to play the brothers, and Willem Dafoe to play the FBI agent. Having found someone to back the film, filming began in Toronto, with the final scenes being filmed in Boston. The name of Duffy&#x27;s band, The Brood, was changed to The Boondock Saints, following the movie&#x27;s release. The film featured two songs from the band: &quot;Holy Fool&quot;, which played during Rocco&#x27;s tavern shootout, and &quot;Pipes&quot;, which played during the credits.

==Release==
&quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; had a very limited theatrical release through Indican Pictures showing the film in 2000 on only five screens in the United States for several weeks. However, the original unrated version of the film was later re-released in theaters on May 22, 2006. Duffy later funded screenings of the film with help from Blockbuster Video. &quot;Indican Pictures and Blockbuster saved us [...] They agreed to take it on exclusively, and from there the rest is history.&quot; According to Troy Duffy on his audio commentary of the film on DVD, the film&#x27;s distributor allowed the limited screening in the United States because of the then-recent Columbine High School massacre and the pending Blockbuster exclusive. The film was shown on major foreign screens (most notably in Japan) with success. Blockbuster released &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; as a &quot;Blockbuster Exclusive&quot;, a collection of independent direct-to-video films. &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; gained a following mostly due to word-of-mouth publicity and was a bestseller when released on DVD. Despite its success, Duffy and Indican Pictures never saw any of the profits from DVD distribution, having signed away the DVD rights to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment as part of the settlement with Franchise Pictures. According to Duffy, neither he, his producers, nor his principal cast got paid. He sued Franchise Pictures and other undisclosed companies for royalties of the first film and rights to the sequel. After a lengthy lawsuit, Troy Duffy, his producers, and the principal cast received an undisclosed amount of &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; royalties, as well as the sequel rights.

===Home media ===
&quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; has been released numerous times on DVD, including an import on March 13, 2001, and an uncut Japanese release published by Toshiba Entertainment, whose special features include anamorphic widescreen, audio commentary, trailers, and interviews with the Japanese media. On May 23, 2006, &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; Collector&#x27;s Edition was published and released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on DVD with THX-certified, as well as Universal Media Disc for the PlayStation Portable. The special features include English and Spanish subtitles, commentary by Billy Connolly and Troy Duffy, deleted scenes, and outtakes. It also featured the film&#x27;s trailer, cast and crew filmographies, and a printable script of the film. 20th Century Fox and Duffy showed an interest in doing a new audio commentary for the special release, but he was unable to because of unresolved legal issues.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 26% of 31 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A juvenile, ugly movie that represents the worst tendencies of directors channeling Tarantino.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described the film, in his review of the DVD, as &quot;less a proper action-thriller&quot; than &quot;a series of gratuitously violent setpieces strung together with only the sketchiest semblance of a plot&quot;. Rabin went on to describe the film as &quot;all style and no substance, a film so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice that it almost veers (or ascends) into self-parody.&quot; 

Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;A belated entry in the hipster crime movie movement that began with &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, Troy Duffy&#x27;s &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; mixes blood and Catholic-tinged vigilante justice in excessive portions for sometimes wacky and always brutal effect. [The film is] more interested in finding fresh ways to stage execution scenes than in finding meaning behind the human urge for self-appointed righting of wrongs.&quot;

Koehler also described Flanery and Reedus as &quot;curiously stolid and blank&quot;, while praising supporting actors Connolly, Dafoe, and Rota for making the most of their screen time. Koehler also praised the tech personnel: &quot;This uneven exercise in pacing and cutting is abetted by an eclectic score by Jeff Danna and whiz lensing by Adam Kane. Other tech credits fire bull&#x27;s-eyes.&quot;

Film critics have taken note of the film&#x27;s extreme violence and &quot;slow-motion bloodletting&quot;.

===Box office===
In its original run, the film only earned $30,471 at five theaters. It later developed a cult following and has grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales.

==Documentary==

The documentary film &quot;Overnight&quot; was released in 2003, following the story of Troy Duffy during his negotiations with Miramax over &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; script, as well as his band&#x27;s struggles to secure a recording contract. Duffy&#x27;s abrasive behavior strained his relationships with friends and people in the film industry and ultimately led to Miramax pulling out of the project, leaving the film to be made by another studio at half the originally proposed budget.

==Sequels==

After numerous delays, Troy Duffy shot a sequel, &quot;The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day&quot;, in which the MacManus twins return to Boston in order to continue their reign of vengeance. It was released October 30, 2009.

In an October 27, 2009, article, director Duffy and actor Connolly mention details regarding a possible third film. They maintained that &quot;it is slowly in the works and is still just an idea&quot;. Duffy insists that he wants to get a few more of his films done before returning to the Boondock Saints. Duffy also added that the proposed working title for the third film would be called &quot;Boondock Saints III: Saints Preserve Us&quot;.

Again, on February 26, 2013, Duffy stated that he was getting together with Reedus and Flanery to resume talks about &quot;The Boondock Saints 3&quot;, in hopes that they could make the film a reality for fans.

As of July 2013, Duffy has confirmed in an interview that he is working on the script for the third film, and possibly a TV series, later named as &quot;The Boondock Saints: Origins&quot;.

On September 3, 2014, the third film, subtitled &quot;Legion&quot;, was revealed to be in pre-production.

In 2017, Flanery tweeted that he and Reedus had walked away from &quot;The Boondock Saints 3&quot;. While he did not elaborate on much, he suggested that the &quot;unethical&quot; production of the project caused their departure.

In November 2021, a third &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; film was officially announced, with Reedus and Flanery reprising their roles as Connor and Murphy MacManus and Duffy returning to direct. Production was slated to begin in May 2022. In March 2024, Thunder Road Films, Dragonfly Films and Impossible Dream Entertainment announced a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the franchise, with Reedus and Flanery reprising their roles and serving as executive producers, although Duffy would not return as director.

== Comic book ==
A two-part comic-book story, serving as a companion to the movie sequel, was released in May 2010. The series is written by Troy Duffy, produced by Innfusion Inc., and released through 12 Gauge Comics. The book focuses on a more in-depth version of Il Duce&#x27;s back story, as well as telling the story of the brothers during a hit they performed that is not featured in the film. It was paired with a minibook that was featured on the official &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; website that told a ministory that takes place before the strip-club scene from the first film. These will eventually be released in one single graphic novel. &quot;The Boondock Saints: In Nomine Patris&quot; was written with J.B. Love and published in November 2011.

== Video game ==
A video game was supposed to be made based on the film, but was later cancelled. The characters of Connor and Murphy would feature in the side scroller &quot;Broforce&quot;, which released in 2015.

<doc id="517382" wikidata="Q1759086" url="?curid=517382" title="The Dells">
<text>The Dells were an American R&amp;B vocal group. Formed in high school in 1953 by founding members Marvin Junior, Verne Allison, Johnny Funches, Chuck Barksdale, and Michael and Lucius McGill, under the name the El-Rays. They released their first recording in 1954 and two years later had their first R&amp;B hit with &quot;Oh What a Night&quot;. After disbanding due to a near-fatal car crash in 1958, the band re-formed in 1960 with Funches being replaced by Johnny Carter. This lineup remained together until Carter&#x27;s death in 2009. In 2004 the Dells were inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. The group performed until illness forced longtime lead singer Marvin Junior and bass vocalist Chuck Barksdale into retirement, ending the group&#x27;s 60-year run.

==History==
===Early career===
The Dells grew up in Harvey, Illinois, and began singing together while attending Thornton Township High School. Forming in 1952 under the name the El-Rays, the group initially consisted of Marvin Junior, Michael McGill, Lucius McGill, Verne Allison, Chuck Barksdale, and Johnny Funches. Lucius McGill soon left the group and the remaining quintet signed with Checker Records, releasing their first single, &quot;Darling I Know&quot;, which flopped.

In 1955, the group renamed themselves the Dells and signed with Vee-Jay Records. In 1956, they recorded their first hit, &quot;Oh, What a Night&quot; (a song co-written by Johnny Funches, who also sang lead on the recording alongside Marvin Junior), which hit the top 5 of the R&amp;B singles chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song is ranked No. 260 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In November 1958, the Dells suffered a car accident that left McGill in a hospital in Ohio for six months. The group temporarily disbanded and Barksdale sang as a member of Harvey Fuqua&#x27;s spinoff Moonglows act, Harvey and the Moonglows, which included a young Marvin Gaye. In 1961, the Dells reunited and auditioned for Dinah Washington. After Washington agreed to hire them, Johnny Funches left the group to take care of his family. Funches was replaced by Flamingos founding member Johnny Carter and sang background for Washington for two years. In 1966, they were hired to open for Ray Charles, only to be fired after a performance resulted in several standing ovations. The group would also sing background for Barbara Lewis, mainly on Lewis&#x27; 1963 hit, &quot;Hello Stranger&quot;, while also working with Quincy Jones, who helped to fine-tune their vocals for standards and jazz material.

===Successful years===
In 1966, the Dells returned to Chess under the label&#x27;s Cadet subsidiary working with Bobby Miller and future Earth, Wind &amp; Fire arranger Charles Stepney. In 1967, the Dells issued the album &quot;There Is&quot; which included their first R&amp;B chart-topper in years with the title track, which showcased the sharp baritone of Marvin Junior and the harmonies with the four other Dells. The song was also their first top 20 pop hit.

Subsequent R&amp;B hits included &quot;Wear It on Our Face&quot;, &quot;Always Together&quot; (top 20 pop), &quot;I Can Sing a Rainbow - Love is Blue (medley)&quot; (UK No. 15), and their first No. 1 R&amp;B hit and first top ten pop hit, 1968&#x27;s &quot;Stay in My Corner&quot;, which reached No. 10 on the pop chart and showcased both Carter and Marvin in lead vocals. In the following year, 1969, The Dells&#x27; soulful remake of their debut hit, &quot;Oh What a Night&quot; gave the group their second chart-topping R&amp;B single and also reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. For a second time, the song sold over a million copies. Subsequent hits included &quot;Open Up My Heart&quot;, &quot;Oh What a Day&quot;, and &quot;On the Dock of the Bay&quot;. In 1971, the Dells&#x27; &quot;The Love We Had Stays on My Mind&quot; became another top ten hit on the R&amp;B chart, also reaching the pop top 30. By this time Charles Stepney had taken over production duties from Bobby Miller. 1973&#x27;s &quot;Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation&quot; was their third certified gold record. The song was written by L.V. Johnson and produced by Don Davis.

===Later years===
Leaving Cadet around the end of 1974 with the parent company in financial difficulties, the group would continue recording in order under the Mercury, ABC, and Virgin labels finding some hits, including 1980&#x27;s &quot;I Touched a Dream&quot;, which returned the group to the top 40 on the R&amp;B chart. The Dells were confined mostly to the oldies market afterwards until they were asked to be creative consultants to Robert Townsend&#x27;s acclaimed 1991 film, &quot;The Five Heartbeats&quot;, which was loosely based on the lives of The Dells and other groups of its era. The group recorded a composition titled &quot;A Heart Is a House for Love&quot;. The song reached number 13 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart, making them only one of two groups to have hit singles in five decades. The following year, signing with PIR, they released the album, &quot;I Salute You&quot;. The Dells continued performing and recording sporadically in the early years of the new millennium. In 2004, the group were inducted to both the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2022 into National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. The group continued performing until 2012.

===Losses===
Original Dells vocalist Johnny Funches died of pneumonia on January 23, 1998, at the age of 62.

Johnny Carter died of cancer on August 21, 2009, at the age of 75. Carter is one of the few artists to be a double Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, having been inducted with The Flamingos in 2001, and the Dells in 2004.

On May 29, 2013, founding member Marvin Junior died in his sleep at his home in Harvey, Illinois, succumbing to complications of kidney failure and a weak heart at the age of 77.

Chuck Barksdale died on May 15, 2019, at the age of 84.

<text>Dasher is an input method and computer accessibility tool which enables users to compose text without using a keyboard, by entering text on a screen with a pointing device such as a mouse, touch screen, or mice operated by the foot or head. Such instruments could serve as prosthetic devices for disabled people who cannot use standard keyboards, or where the use of one is impractical.

Dasher is free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Dasher is available for operating systems with GTK+ support, i.e. Linux, BSDs and other Unix-like including macOS, Microsoft Windows, Pocket PC, iOS and Android.

Dasher was invented by David J. C. MacKay and developed by David Ward and other members of MacKay&#x27;s Cambridge research group. The Dasher project is supported by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and by the EU aegis-project.

==Design==
For whatever the writer intends to write, they select a letter from ones displayed on a screen by using a pointer, whereupon the system uses a probabilistic predictive model to anticipate the likely character combinations for the next piece of text, and accord these higher priority by displaying them more prominently than less likely letter combinations. This saves the user effort and time as they proceed to choose the next letter from those offered. The process of composing text in this way has been likened to an arcade game, as users zoom through characters that fly across the screen and select them in order to compose text. The system learns from experience which letter combinations are the most popular, and changes its display protocol over time to reflect this.

==Features==
The Dasher package contains various architecture-independent data files:
* alphabet descriptions for over 150 languages
* letter colours settings
* training files in all supported languages

<doc id="517386" wikidata="Q373665" url="?curid=517386" title="Biblical criticism">
<text>Modern Biblical criticism (as opposed to pre-Modern criticism) is the use of critical analysis to understand and explain the Bible without appealing to the supernatural. During the eighteenth century, when it began as &quot;historical-biblical criticism,&quot; it was based on two distinguishing characteristics: (1) the concern to avoid dogma and bias by applying a neutral, non-sectarian, reason-based judgment to the study of the Bible, and (2) the belief that the reconstruction of the historical events behind the texts, as well as the history of how the texts themselves developed, would lead to a correct understanding of the Bible. This sets it apart from earlier, pre-critical methods; from the anti-critical methods of those who oppose criticism-based study; from the post-critical orientation of later scholarship; and from the multiple distinct schools of criticism into which it evolved in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

The emergence of biblical criticism is most often attributed by scholars to the German Enlightenment (), but some trace its roots back further, to the Reformation. Its principal scholarly influences were rationalist and Protestant in orientation; German pietism played a role in its development, as did British deism. Against the backdrop of Enlightenment-era skepticism of biblical and church authority, scholars began to study the life of Jesus through a historical lens, breaking with the traditional theological focus on the nature and interpretation of his divinity. This historical turn marked the beginning of the quest for the historical Jesus, which would remain an area of scholarly interest for over 200 years.

Historical-biblical criticism includes a wide range of approaches and questions within four major methodologies: textual, source, form, and literary criticism. Textual criticism examines biblical manuscripts and their content to identify what the original text probably said. Source criticism searches the text for evidence of their original sources. Form criticism identifies short units of text seeking the setting of their origination. Redaction criticism later developed as a derivative of both source and form criticism. Each of these methods was primarily historical and focused on what went on before the texts were in their present form. Literary criticism, which emerged in the twentieth century, differed from these earlier methods. It focused on the literary structure of the texts as they currently exist, determining, where possible, the author&#x27;s purpose, and discerning the reader&#x27;s response to the text through methods such as rhetorical criticism, canonical criticism, and narrative criticism. All together, these various methods of biblical criticism permanently changed how people understood the Bible. 
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, biblical criticism was influenced by a wide range of additional academic disciplines and theoretical perspectives which led to its transformation. Having long been dominated by white male Protestant academics, the twentieth century saw others such as non-white scholars, women, and those from the Jewish and Catholic traditions become prominent voices in biblical criticism. Globalization introduced a broader spectrum of worldviews and perspectives into the field, and other academic disciplines, e.g. Near Eastern studies and philology, formed new methods of biblical criticism. Meanwhile, postmodern and post-critical interpretations began questioning whether biblical criticism even had a role or function at all. With these new methods came new goals, as biblical criticism moved from the historical to the literary, and its basic premise changed from neutral judgment to a recognition of the various biases the reader brings to the study of the texts.

==Definition==
Daniel J. Harrington defines biblical criticism as &quot;the effort at using scientific criteria (historical and literary) and human reason to understand and explain, as objectively as possible, the meaning intended by the biblical writers.&quot; The original biblical criticism has been mostly defined by its historical concerns. Critics focused on the historical events behind the text as well as the history of how the texts themselves developed. So much biblical criticism has been done as history, and not theology, that it is sometimes called the &quot;historical-critical method&quot; or historical-biblical criticism (or sometimes &quot;higher criticism&quot;) instead of just biblical criticism. Biblical critics used the same scientific methods and approaches to history as their secular counterparts and emphasized reason and objectivity. Neutrality was seen as a defining requirement.

By 1990, new perspectives, globalization and input from different academic fields expanded biblical criticism, moving it beyond its original criteria, and changing it into a group of disciplines with different, often conflicting, interests. Biblical criticism&#x27;s central concept changed from neutral judgment to beginning from a recognition of the various biases the reader brings to the study of the texts. Newer forms of biblical criticism are primarily literary: no longer focused on the historical, they attend to the text as it exists now.

== History ==
=== Eighteenth century ===
In the Enlightenment era of the European West, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), Benedict Spinoza (1632–1677), and Richard Simon (1638–1712) began to question the long-established Judeo-Christian tradition that Moses was the author of the first five books of the Bible known as the Pentateuch. Spinoza wrote that Moses could not have written the preface to the fifth book, Deuteronomy, since he never crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land. There were also other problems such as which references Moses in the third person. According to Spinoza: &quot;All these details, the manner of narration, the testimony, and the context of the whole story lead to the plain conclusion that these books were written by another, and not by Moses in person&quot;.

Jean Astruc (1684–1766), a French physician, believed these critics were wrong about Mosaic authorship. According to Old Testament scholar Edward Young (1907–1968), Astruc believed that Moses the first book of the Pentateuch, the book of Genesis, using the hereditary accounts of the Hebrew people. Biblical criticism is often said to have begun when Astruc borrowed methods of textual criticism (used to investigate Greek and Roman texts) and applied them to the Bible in search of those original accounts. Astruc believed that, through this approach, he had identified the separate sources that were edited together into the book of Genesis. The existence of separate sources explained the inconsistent style and vocabulary of Genesis, discrepancies in the narrative, differing accounts and chronological difficulties, while still allowing for Mosaic authorship. Astruc&#x27;s work was the genesis of biblical criticism, and because it has become the template for all who followed, he is often called the &quot;Father of Biblical criticism&quot;.

The questioning of religious authority common to German Pietism contributed to the rise of biblical criticism. Rationalism also became a significant influence: Swiss theologian Jean Alphonse Turretin (1671–1737) is an example of the &quot;moderate rationalism&quot; of the era. Turretin believed that the Bible was divine revelation, but insisted that revelation must be consistent with nature and in harmony with reason, &quot;For God who is the author of revelation is likewise the author of reason&quot;. What was seen as extreme rationalism followed in the work of Heinrich Paulus (1761–1851) who denied the existence of miracles.

Johann Salomo Semler (1725–1791) had attempted in his work to navigate between divine revelation and extreme rationalism by supporting the view that revelation was &quot;divine disclosure of the truth perceived through the depth of human experience&quot;. He distinguished between &quot;inward&quot; and &quot;outward&quot; religion: for some people, their religion is their highest inner purpose, while for others, religion is a more exterior practice – a tool to accomplish other purposes more important to the individual, such as political or economic goals. Recognition of this distinction now forms part of the modern field of cognitive science of religion. Semler argued for an end to all doctrinal assumptions, giving historical criticism its nonsectarian character. As a result, Semler is often called the father of historical-critical research. &quot;Despite the difference in attitudes between the thinkers and the historians [of the German enlightenment], all viewed history as the key ... in their search for understanding&quot;.

Communications scholar James A. Herrick (b. 1954) says that even though most scholars agree that biblical criticism evolved out of the German Enlightenment, there are some historians of biblical criticism that have found &quot;strong direct links&quot; with British deism. Herrick references the German theologian Henning Graf Reventlow (1929–2010) as linking deism with the humanist world view, which has been significant in biblical criticism. Matthew Tindal (1657–1733), as part of British deism, asserted that Jesus taught an undogmatic natural religion that the Church later changed into its own dogmatic form. Tindal&#x27;s view of Christianity as a &quot;mere confirmation of natural religion and his resolute denial of the supernatural&quot; led him to conclude that &quot;revealed religion is superfluous&quot;. British deism was also an influence on the philosopher and writer Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768) in developing his criticism of revelation.

The biblical scholar Johann David Michaelis (1717–1791) advocated the use of other Semitic languages in addition to Hebrew to understand the Old Testament, and in 1750, wrote the first modern critical introduction to the New Testament. Instead of interpreting the Bible historically, Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752–1827), Johann Philipp Gabler (1753–1826), and Georg Lorenz Bauer (1755–1806) used the concept of myth as a tool for interpreting the Bible. Rudolf Bultmann later used this approach, and it became particularly influential in the early twentieth century.

George Ricker Berry says the term &quot;higher criticism&quot;, which is sometimes used as an alternate name for historical criticism, was first used by Eichhorn in his three-volume work &quot;Einleitung ins Alte Testament&quot; (Introduction to the Old Testament) published between 1780 and 1783. The term was originally used to differentiate higher criticism, the term for historical criticism, from lower, which was the term commonly used for textual criticism at the time. The importance of textual criticism means that the term &#x27;lower criticism&#x27; is no longer used much in twenty-first century studies.

A twenty–first century view of biblical criticism&#x27;s origins, that traces it to the Reformation, is a minority position, but the Reformation is the source of biblical criticism&#x27;s advocacy of freedom from external authority imposing its views on biblical interpretation. Long before Richard Simon, the historical context of the biblical texts was important to Joachim Camerarius (1500–1574) who wrote a philological study of figures of speech in the biblical texts using their context to understand them. Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) paved the way for comparative religion studies by analyzing New Testament texts in the light of Classical, Jewish and early Christian writings.

==== Historical Jesus: the first quest ====

The first quest for the historical Jesus is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Quest.&quot; It began with the publication of Hermann Samuel Reimarus&#x27;s work after his death. G. E. Lessing (1729–1781) claimed to have discovered copies of Reimarus&#x27;s writings in the library at Wolfenbüttel when he was the librarian there. Reimarus had left permission for his work to be published after his death, and Lessing did so between 1774 and 1778, publishing them as &quot;Die Fragmente eines unbekannten Autors&quot; (&quot;The Fragments of an Unknown Author&quot;). Over time, they came to be known as the &quot;Wolfenbüttel Fragments.&quot; Reimarus distinguished between what Jesus taught and how he is portrayed in the New Testament. According to Reimarus, Jesus was a political Messiah who failed at creating political change and was executed by the Roman state as a dissident. His disciples then stole the body and invented the story of the resurrection for personal gain.

Albert Schweitzer in &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus,&quot; acknowledges that Reimarus&#x27;s work &quot;is a polemic, not an objective historical study&quot;, while also referring to it as &quot;a masterpiece of world literature.&quot; According to Schweitzer, Reimarus was wrong in his assumption that Jesus&#x27;s end-of-world eschatology was &quot;earthly and political in character&quot; but was right in viewing Jesus as an apocalyptic preacher, as evidenced by his repeated warnings about the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of time. This eschatological approach to understanding Jesus has since become universal in modern biblical criticism. Schweitzer also comments that, since Reimarus was a historian and not a theologian or a biblical scholar, he &quot;had not the slightest inkling&quot; that source criticism would provide the solution to the problems of literary consistency that Reimarus had raised.

Reimarus&#x27;s controversial work garnered a response from Semler in 1779: &quot;Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten&quot; (Answering the Fragments of an Unknown). Schweitzer records that Semler &quot;rose up and slew Reimarus in the name of scientific theology&quot;. Respect for Semler temporarily repressed the dissemination and study of Reimarus&#x27;s work, but Semler&#x27;s response had no long-term effect. Reimarus&#x27;s writings, on the other hand, did have a long-term effect. They made a lasting change in the practice of biblical criticism by making it clear it could exist independently of theology and faith. His work also showed biblical criticism could serve its own ends, be governed solely by rational criteria, and reject deference to religious tradition. Reimarus&#x27;s central question, &quot;How political was Jesus?&quot;, continues to be debated by theologians and historians such as , Gerd Theissen and Craig S. Keener.

In addition to overseeing the publication of Reimarus&#x27;s work, Lessing made contributions of his own, arguing that the proper study of biblical texts requires knowing the context in which they were written. This is now the accepted scholarly view.

===Nineteenth century===
Professors Richard Soulen and Kendall Soulen write that biblical criticism reached &quot;full flower&quot; in the nineteenth century, becoming the &quot;major transforming fact of biblical studies in the modern period&quot;. The height of biblical criticism&#x27;s influence is represented by the history of religions school a group of German Protestant theologians associated with the University of Göttingen. In the late nineteenth century, they sought to understand Judaism and Christianity within the overall history of religion. Other Bible scholars outside the Göttingen school, such as Heinrich Julius Holtzmann (1832–1910), also used biblical criticism. Holtzmann developed the first listing of the chronological order of the New Testament texts based on critical scholarship.

Many insights in understanding the Bible that began in the nineteenth century continue to be discussed in the twenty-first; in some areas of study, such as linguistic tools, scholars merely appropriate earlier work, while in others they &quot;continue to suppose they can produce something new and better&quot;. For example, some modern histories of Israel include historical biblical research from the nineteenth century. In 1835, and again in 1845, theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur postulated the apostles Peter and Paul had an argument that led to a split between them thereby influencing the mode of Christianity that followed. This still occasions widespread debate within topics such as Pauline studies, New Testament Studies, early-church studies, Jewish Law, the theology of grace, and the doctrine of justification. Albrecht Ritschl&#x27;s challenge to orthodox atonement theory continues to influence Christian thought.

Nineteenth-century biblical critics &quot;thought of themselves as continuing the aims of the Protestant Reformation&quot;. According to Robert M. Grant and David Tracy, &quot;One of the most striking features of the development of biblical interpretation during the nineteenth century was the way in which philosophical presuppositions implicitly guided it&quot;. Michael Joseph Brown points out that biblical criticism operated according to principles grounded in a distinctively European rationalism. By the end of the nineteenth century, these principles were recognized by Ernst Troeltsch in an essay, &quot;Historical and Dogmatic Method in Theology,&quot; where he described three principles of biblical criticism: methodological doubt (a way of searching for certainty by doubting everything); analogy (the idea that we understand the past by relating it to our present); and mutual inter-dependence (every event is related to events that proceeded it).

Biblical criticism&#x27;s focus on pure reason produced a paradigm shift that profoundly changed Christian theology concerning the Jews. uses the legal meaning of emancipation, as in free to be an adult on their own recognizance, when he says the &quot;process of the from the Bible ... runs parallel with the emancipation of Christianity from the Jews&quot;. In the previous century, Semler had been the first Enlightenment Protestant to call for the &quot;de-Judaizing&quot; of Christianity. While taking a stand against discrimination in society, Semler also wrote theology that was strongly negative toward the Jews and Judaism. He saw Christianity as something that &#x27;superseded&#x27; all that came before it. This stark contrast between Judaism and Christianity produced increasingly antisemitic sentiments. Supersessionism, instead of the more traditional millennialism, became a common theme in Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette (1780–1849), Ferdinand Christian Baur (1792–1860), David Strauss (1808–1874), Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889), the history of religions school of the 1890s, and on into the form critics of the twentieth century until World War II.

==== Historical Jesus: the lives of Jesus ====
The late-nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in the quest for the historical Jesus which primarily involved writing versions of the life of Jesus. Important scholars of this quest included David Strauss (1808–1874), whose &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; used a mythical interpretation of the gospels to undermine their historicity. The book was culturally significant because it contributed to weakening church authority, and it was theologically significant because it challenged the divinity of Christ. In &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; (1900), Adolf Von Harnack (1851–1930) described Jesus as a reformer. William Wrede (1859–1906) rejected all the theological aspects of Jesus and asserted that the &quot;messianic secret&quot; of Jesus as Messiah emerged only in the early community and did not come from Jesus himself. Ernst Renan (1823–1892) promoted the critical method and was opposed to orthodoxy. Wilhelm Bousset (1865–1920) attained honors in the history of religions school by contrasting what he called the joyful teachings of Jesus&#x27;s and what Bousset saw as the gloomy call to repentance made by John the Baptist. While at Göttingen, Johannes Weiss (1863–1914) wrote his most influential work on the apocalyptic proclamations of Jesus.

In 1896, Martin Kähler (1835–1912) wrote &quot;The So-called Historical Jesus and the Historic Biblical Christ&quot;. It critiqued the quest&#x27;s methodology, with a reminder of the limits of historical inquiry, saying it is impossible to separate the historical Jesus from the Jesus of faith, since Jesus is only known through documents about him as Christ the Messiah.

The Old Quest was not considered closed until Albert Schweitzer (1875–1965) wrote &quot;Von Reimarus zu Wrede&quot; which was published in English as &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot; in 1910. In it, Schweitzer scathingly critiqued the various books on the life of Jesus that had been written in the late-nineteenth century as reflecting more of the lives of the authors than Jesus. Schweitzer revolutionized New Testament scholarship at the turn of the century by proving to most of that scholarly world that the teachings and actions of Jesus were determined by his eschatological outlook; he thereby finished the quest&#x27;s pursuit of the apocalyptic Jesus. Schweitzer concluded that any future research on the historical Jesus was pointless.

=== Twentieth century ===

In the early twentieth century, biblical criticism was shaped by two main factors and the clash between them. First, form criticism arose and turned the focus of biblical criticism from author to genre, and from individual to community. Next, a scholarly effort to reclaim the Bible&#x27;s theological relevance began. Karl Barth (1886–1968), Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976), and others moved away from concern over the historical Jesus and concentrated instead on the &quot;kerygma&quot;: the message of the New Testament.

Most scholars agree that Bultmann is one of the &quot;most influential theologians of the twentieth-century&quot;, but that he also had a &quot;notorious reputation for his de-mythologizing&quot; which was debated around the world. Demythologizing refers to the reinterpretation of the biblical myths (stories) in terms of the existential philosophy of Martin Heidegger (1889–1976). Bultmann claimed myths are &quot;true&quot; anthropologically and existentially but not cosmologically. As a major proponent of form criticism, Bultmann &quot;set the agenda for a subsequent generation of leading NT [New Testament] scholars&quot;.

Around the midcentury point the denominational composition of biblical critics began to change. This was due to a shift in perception of the critical effort as being possible on the basis of premises other than liberal Protestantism. Redaction criticism also began in the mid-twentieth century. While form criticism had divided the text into small units, redaction emphasized the literary integrity of the larger literary units instead.

The discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls at Qumran in 1948 renewed interest in archaeology&#x27;s potential contributions to biblical studies, but it also posed challenges to biblical criticism. For example, the majority of the Dead Sea texts are closely related to the Masoretic Text that the Christian Old Testament is based upon, while other texts bear a closer resemblance to the Septuagint (the ancient Greek version of the Hebrew texts) and still others are closer to the Samaritan Pentateuch. This has raised the question of whether or not there is such a thing as an &quot;original text&quot;. If there is no original text, the entire purpose of textual criticism is called into question.

New Testament scholar Joachim Jeremias (1900–1979) used linguistics, and Jesus&#x27;s first-century Jewish environment, to interpret the New Testament. The biblical theology movement of the 1950s produced debate between Old Testament and New Testament scholars over the unity of the Bible. The rise of redaction criticism closed this debate by bringing about a greater emphasis on diversity. The &quot;New&quot; quest for the historical Jesus began in 1953 and was so-named in 1959 by James M. Robinson.

After 1970, biblical criticism began to change radically and pervasively. New criticism, which developed as an adjunct to literary criticism, was concerned with the particulars of style. New historicism, a literary theory that views history through literature, also developed. Biblical criticism began to apply new literary approaches such as structuralism and rhetorical criticism, which concentrated less on history and more on the texts themselves. In the 1970s, the New Testament scholar E. P. Sanders (1937–2022) advanced the New Perspective on Paul, which has greatly influenced scholarly views on the relationship between Pauline Christianity and Jewish Christianity in the Pauline epistles. Sanders also advanced study of the historical Jesus by putting Jesus&#x27;s life in the context of first-century Second-Temple Judaism. In 1974, the theologian Hans Frei published &quot;The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative&quot;, which became a landmark work leading to the development of post-critical interpretation. The third period of focused study on the historical Jesus began in 1988.

By 1990, biblical criticism as a primarily historical discipline changed into a group of disciplines with often conflicting interests. New perspectives from different ethnicities, feminist theology, Catholicism and Judaism offered insights previously overlooked by the majority of white male Protestants who had dominated biblical criticism from its beginnings. Globalization also introduced different worldviews; these new points-of-view created awareness that the Bible can be rationally interpreted from many different perspectives. In turn, this awareness changed biblical criticism&#x27;s central concept from the criteria of neutral judgment to that of beginning from a recognition of the various biases the reader brings to the study of the texts.

==== Historical Jesus: the &quot;New&quot; quest into the twenty-first century ====


There is no general agreement among scholars on how to periodize the various quests for the historical Jesus. Most scholars agree the first quest began with Reimarus and ended with Schweitzer, that there was a &quot;no-quest&quot; period in the first half of the twentieth century, and that there was a second quest, known as the &quot;New&quot; quest that began in 1953 and lasted until 1988 when a third began. However, Stanley E. Porter (b. 1956) calls this periodization &quot;untenable and belied by all of the pertinent facts&quot;, arguing that people were searching for the historical Jesus before Reimarus, and that there never has been a period when scholars were not doing so.

In 1953, Ernst Käsemann (1906–1998), gave a famous lecture before the &quot;Old Marburgers,&quot; his former colleagues at the University of Marburg, where he had studied under Bultmann. In this stronghold of support for Bultmann, Käsemann claimed &quot;Bultmann&#x27;s skepticism about what could be known about the historical Jesus had been too extreme&quot;. Bultmann had claimed that, since the gospel writers wrote theology, their writings could not be considered history, but Käsemann reasoned that one does not necessarily preclude the other. James M. Robinson named this the &quot;New&quot; quest in his 1959 essay &quot;The New Quest for the Historical Jesus&quot;. This quest focused largely on the teachings of Jesus as interpreted by existentialist philosophy. Interest waned again by the 1970s.

N. T. Wright asserts that the third quest began with the Jesus Seminar in 1988. By then, it became necessary to acknowledge that &quot;the upshot of the first two quests... was to reveal the frustrating limitations of the historical study of any ancient person&quot;. According to Ben Witherington, probability is all that is possible in this pursuit. Paul Montgomery in &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that &quot;Through the ages scholars and laymen have taken various positions on the life of Jesus, ranging from total acceptance of the Bible to assertions that Jesus of Nazareth is a creature of myth and never lived.&quot;

Sanders explains that, because of the desire to know everything about Jesus, including his thoughts and motivations, and because there are such varied conclusions about him, it seems to many scholars that it is impossible to be certain about anything. Yet according to Sanders, &quot;we know quite a lot&quot; about Jesus. While scholars rarely agree about what is known or unknown about the historical Jesus, according to Witherington, scholars do agree that &quot;the historic questions should not be dodged&quot;.

== Major methods ==
Theologian David R. Law writes that biblical scholars usually employ textual, source, form, and redaction criticism together. The Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible), and the New Testament, as distinct bodies of literature, each raise their own problems of interpretation - the two are therefore generally studied separately. For purposes of discussion, these individual methods are separated here and the Bible is addressed as a whole, but this is an artificial approach that is used only for the purpose of description, and is not how biblical criticism is actually practiced.

=== Textual criticism ===
Textual criticism involves examination of the text itself and all associated manuscripts with the aim of determining the original text. It is one of the largest areas of biblical criticism in terms of the sheer amount of information it addresses. The roughly 900 manuscripts found at Qumran include the oldest extant manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible. They represent every book except Esther, though most books appear only in fragmentary form. The New Testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work, having over 5,800 complete or fragmented Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including Syriac, Slavic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Coptic, and Armenian texts. The dates of these manuscripts are generally accepted to range from c.110–125 (the papyrus) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the fifteenth century. There are also approximately a million direct New Testament quotations in the collected writings of the Church Fathers of the first four centuries. (As a comparison, the next best-sourced ancient text is the &quot;Iliad&quot;, presumably written by the ancient Greek Homer in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE, which survives in more than 1,900 manuscripts, though many are of a fragmentary nature.)
These texts were all written by hand, by copying from another handwritten text, so they are not alike in the manner of printed works. The differences between them are called variants. A variant is simply any variation between two texts. Many variants are simple misspellings or mis-copying. For example, a scribe might drop one or more letters, skip a word or line, write one letter for another, transpose letters, and so on. Some variants represent a scribal attempt to simplify or harmonize, by changing a word or a phrase.

The exact number of variants is disputed, but the more texts survive, the more likely there will be variants of some kind. Variants are not evenly distributed throughout any set of texts. Charting the variants in the New Testament shows it is 62.9 percent variant-free. The impact of variants on the reliability of a single text is usually tested by comparing it to a manuscript whose reliability has been long established. Though many new early manuscripts have been discovered since 1881, there are critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as NA28 and UBS5, that &quot;have gone virtually unchanged&quot; from these discoveries. &quot;It also means that the fourth century &#x27;best texts&#x27;, the &#x27;Alexandrian&#x27; codices Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, have roots extending throughout the entire third century and even into the second&quot;. 
Variants are classified into . Say scribe &quot;&#x27;A&#x27;&quot; makes a mistake and scribe &quot;&#x27;B&#x27;&quot; does not. Copies of scribe &quot;&#x27;A&#x27;s&quot; text with the mistake will thereafter contain that same mistake. Over time the texts descended from &quot;&#x27;A&#x27;&quot; that share the error, and those from &quot;&#x27;B&#x27;&quot; that do not share it, will diverge further, but later texts will still be identifiable as descended from one or the other because of the presence or absence of that original mistake. The multiple generations of texts that follow, containing the error, are referred to as a &quot;family&quot; of texts. Textual critics study the differences between these families to piece together what the original looked like. Sorting out the wealth of source material is complex, so textual families were sorted into categories tied to geographical areas. The divisions of the New Testament textual families were &quot;Alexandrian&quot; (also called the &quot;Neutral text&quot;), &quot;Western&quot; (Latin translations), and &quot;Eastern&quot; (used by churches centred on Antioch and Constantinople).

Forerunners of modern textual criticism can be found in both early Rabbinic Judaism and in the early church. Rabbis addressed variants in the Hebrew texts as early as 100CE. Tradition played a central role in their task of producing a standard version of the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew text they produced stabilized by the end of the second century, and has come to be known as the Masoretic text.

==== Problems of textual criticism ====
The two main processes of textual criticism are recension and emendation:

* Recension is the selection of the most trustworthy evidence on which to base a text.
* Emendation is the attempt to eliminate the errors which are found even in the best manuscripts.

Jerome McGann says these methods innately introduce a subjective factor into textual criticism despite its attempt at objective rules. Alan Cooper discusses this difficulty using the example of Amos 6.12 which reads: &quot;Does one plough with oxen?&quot; The obvious answer is &quot;yes&quot;, but the context of the passage seems to demand a &quot;no&quot;. Cooper explains that a recombination of the consonants allows it to be read &quot;Does one plough &quot;the sea&quot; with oxen?&quot; The amendment has a basis in the text, which is believed to be corrupted, but is nevertheless a matter of personal judgment.

This contributes to textual criticism being one of the most contentious areas of biblical criticism, as well as the largest, with scholars such as Arthur Verrall referring to it as the &quot;fine and contentious art&quot;. It uses specialized methodologies, enough specialized terms to create its own lexicon, and is guided by a number of principles. Yet any of these principles—and their conclusions—can be contested. For example, in the late 1700s, textual critic Johann Jacob Griesbach (1745 – 1812) developed fifteen critical principles for determining which texts are likely the oldest and closest to the original. One of Griesbach&#x27;s rules is &quot;lectio brevior praeferenda&quot;: &quot;the shorter reading is to be preferred&quot;. This was based on the assumption that scribes were more likely to add to a text than omit from it, making shorter texts more likely to be older.

Latin scholar Albert C. Clark challenged Griesbach&#x27;s view of shorter texts in 1914. Based on his study of Cicero, Clark argued omission was a more common scribal error than addition, saying &quot;A text is like a traveler who goes from one inn to another losing an article of luggage at each halt&quot;. Clark&#x27;s claims were criticized by those who supported Griesbach&#x27;s principles. Clark responded, but disagreement continued. Nearly eighty years later, the theologian and priest James Royse took up the case. After close study of multiple New Testament papyri, he concluded Clark was right, and Griesbach&#x27;s rule of measure was wrong. Some twenty-first century scholars have advocated abandoning these older approaches to textual criticism in favor of new computer-assisted methods for determining manuscript relationships in a more reliable way.

=== Source criticism ===
Source criticism is the search for the original sources that form the basis of biblical texts. In Old Testament studies, source criticism is generally focused on identifying sources of a single text. For example, the seventeenth-century French priest Richard Simon (1638–1712) was an early proponent of the theory that Moses could not have been the single source of the entire Pentateuch. According to Simon, parts of the Old Testament were not written by individuals at all, but by scribes recording the community&#x27;s oral tradition. The French physician Jean Astruc presumed in 1753 that Moses had written the book of Genesis (the first book of the Pentateuch) using ancient documents; he attempted to identify these original sources and to separate them again. He did this by identifying repetitions of certain events, such as parts of the flood story that are repeated three times, indicating the possibility of three sources. He discovered that the alternation of two different names for God occurs in Genesis and up to Exodus 3 but not in the rest of the Pentateuch, and he also found apparent anachronisms: statements seemingly from a later time than that in which Genesis was set. This and similar evidence led Astruc to hypothesize that the sources of Genesis were originally separate materials that were later fused into a single unit that became the book of Genesis.

Examples of source criticism include its two most influential and well-known theories, the first concerning the origins of the Pentateuch in the Old Testament (Wellhausen&#x27;s hypothesis); and the second tracing the sources of the four gospels of the New Testament (two-source hypothesis).

==== Source criticism of the Old Testament: Wellhausen&#x27;s hypothesis ====
Source criticism&#x27;s most influential work is Julius Wellhausen&#x27;s &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot; (&quot;Prologue to the History of Israel&quot;, 1878) which sought to establish the sources of the first five books of the Old Testament - collectively known as the Pentateuch. Wellhausen correlated the history and development of those five books with the development of the Jewish faith. The Wellhausen hypothesis (also known as the &quot;JEDP&quot; theory, or the Documentary hypothesis, or the Graf–Wellhausen hypothesis) proposes that the Pentateuch was combined out of four separate and coherent (unified single) sources (not fragments).

J stands for the Yahwist source, (&quot;Jahwist&quot; in German), and was considered to be the most primitive in style and therefore the oldest. E (for Elohist) was thought to be a product of the Northern Kingdom before BCE 721; D (for Deuteronomist) was said to be written shortly before it was found in BCE 621 by King Josiah of Judah (). Old Testament scholar Karl Graf (1815–1869) suggested an additional priestly source in 1866; by 1878, Wellhausen had incorporated this source, P, into his theory, which is thereafter sometimes referred to as the Graf–Wellhausen hypothesis. Wellhausen argued that P had been composed during the exile of the 6th century BCE, under the influence of Ezekiel. These sources are supposed to have been edited together by a late final Redactor (R) who is only imprecisely understood.

Later scholars added to and refined Wellhausen&#x27;s theory. For example, the &quot;Newer Documentary Thesis&quot; inferred more sources, with increasing information about their extent and inter-relationship. The &quot;fragmentary theory&quot; was a later understanding of Wellhausen produced by form criticism. This theory argues that fragments of documents — rather than continuous, coherent documents — are the sources for the Pentateuch. Alexander Geddes and Johann Vater proposed that some of these fragments were quite ancient, perhaps from the time of Moses, and were brought together only at a later time. This accounts for diversity but not structural and chronological consistency.

One can see the Supplementary hypothesis as yet another evolution of Wellhausen&#x27;s theory that solidified in the 1970s. Proponents of this view assert three sources for the Pentateuch: the Deuteronomist as the oldest source, the Elohist as the central core document, with a number of fragments or independent sources as the third. Deuteronomy is seen as a single coherent document with a uniformity of style and language in spite of also having different literary strata. This observation led to the idea there was such a thing as a &quot;Deuteronomist school&quot; that had originally edited and kept the document updated. This meant the supplementary model became the literary model most widely agreed upon for Deuteronomy, which then supports its application to the remainder of the Pentateuch as well.

===== Critique of Wellhausen =====
Advocates of Wellhausen&#x27;s hypothesis contend it accounts well for the differences and duplication found in the Pentateuchal books. Furthermore, they argue, it provides an explanation for the peculiar character of the material labeled P, which reflects the perspective and concerns of Israel&#x27;s priests. Wellhausen&#x27;s theory went virtually unchallenged until the 1970s, when it began to be heavily criticized. By the end of the 1970s and into the 1990s, &quot;one major study after another, like a series of hammer blows, has rejected the main claims of the Documentary theory, and the criteria on the basis of which they were argued&quot;. It has been criticized for its dating of the sources, and for assuming that the original sources were coherent or complete documents. Studies of the literary structure of the Pentateuch have shown J and P used the same structure, and that motifs and themes cross the boundaries of the various sources, which undermines arguments for their separate origins.

Problems and criticisms of the Documentary hypothesis have been brought on by literary analysts who point out the error of judging ancient Eastern writings as if they were the products of western European Protestants; and by advances in anthropology that undermined Wellhausen&#x27;s assumptions about how cultures develop; and also by various archaeological findings showing the cultural environment of the early Hebrews was more advanced than Wellhausen thought. As a result, few biblical scholars of the twenty-first century hold to Wellhausen&#x27;s Documentary hypothesis in its classical form. As Nicholson says: &quot;it is in sharp decline—some would say in a state of advanced &quot;rigor mortis&quot;—and new solutions are being argued and urged in its place&quot;. Yet no replacement has so far been agreed upon: &quot;the work of Wellhausen, for all that it needs revision and development in detail, remains the securest basis for understanding the Pentateuch&quot;.

==== Source criticism of the New Testament: the synoptic problem ====
In New Testament studies, source criticism has taken a slightly different approach from Old Testament studies by focusing on identifying the common sources of multiple texts instead of looking for the multiple sources of a single set of texts. This has revealed that the Gospels are both products of sources and sources themselves. As sources, Matthew, Mark and Luke are partially dependent on each other and partially independent of each other. This is called the synoptic problem, and explaining it is the single greatest dilemma of New Testament source criticism. Any explanation offered must &quot;account for (a) what is common to all the Gospels; (b) what is common to any two of them; (c) what is peculiar to each&quot;. Multiple theories exist to address the dilemma, with none universally agreed upon, but two theories have become predominant: the two-source hypothesis and the four-source hypothesis.

Mark is the shortest of the four gospels with only 661 verses, but 600 of those verses are in Matthew and 350 of them are in Luke. Some of these verses are verbatim. Most scholars agree that this indicates Mark was a source for Matthew and Luke. There is also some verbatim agreement between Matthew and Luke of verses not found in Mark. In 1838, the religious philosopher Christian Hermann Weisse developed a theory about this. He postulated a hypothetical collection of the sayings of Jesus from an additional source called Q, taken from &quot;Quelle&quot;, which is German for &quot;source&quot;.

If this document existed, it has now been lost, but some of its material can be deduced indirectly. There are five highly detailed arguments in favor of Q&#x27;s existence: the verbal agreement of Mark and Luke, the order of the parables, the doublets, a discrepancy in the priorities of each gospel, and each one&#x27;s internal coherence. Q allowed the two-source hypothesis to emerge as the best supported of the various synoptic solutions. There is also material unique to each gospel. This indicates additional separate sources for Matthew and for Luke. Biblical scholar B. H. Streeter used this insight to refine and expand the two-source theory into a four-source theory in 1925.

===== Two-source theory critique =====
While most scholars agree that the two-source theory offers the best explanation for the Synoptic problem, and some say it has been solved, others say it is not solved satisfactorily. Donald Guthrie says no single theory offers a complete solution as there are complex and important difficulties that create challenges to every theory. One example is Basil Christopher Butler&#x27;s challenge to the legitimacy of two-source theory, arguing it contains a &quot;Lachmann fallacy&quot; that says the two-source theory loses cohesion when it is acknowledged that no source can be established for Mark. F. C. Grant posits multiple sources for the Gospels.

=== Form criticism ===
Form criticism began in the early twentieth century when theologian Karl Ludwig Schmidt observed that Mark&#x27;s Gospel is composed of short units. Schmidt asserted these small units were remnants and evidence of the oral tradition that preceded the writing of the gospels. Bible scholar Richard Bauckham says this &quot;most significant insight,&quot; which established the foundation of form criticism, has never been refuted. Hermann Gunkel (1862–1932) and Martin Dibelius (1883–1947) built from this insight and pioneered form criticism. By the 1950s and 1960s, Rudolf Bultmann and form criticism were the &quot;center of the theological conversation in both Europe and North America&quot;.

Form criticism breaks down biblical pasage into short units called &quot;pericopes&quot;, which are then classified by genre: prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament, and so on. Form criticism then theorizes concerning the individual pericope&#x27;s &quot;Sitz im Leben&quot; (&quot;setting in life&quot; or &quot;place in life&quot;). Based on their understanding of folklore, form critics believed the early Christian communities formed the sayings and teachings of Jesus themselves, according to their needs (their &quot;situation in life&quot;), and that each form could be identified by the situation in which it had been created and vice versa.

==== Critique of form criticism ====
In the early- to mid- twentieth century, form critics thought finding oral &quot;laws of development&quot; within the New Testament would prove the form critic&#x27;s assertions that the texts had evolved within the early Christian communities according to &quot;sitz im leben&quot;. Since Mark was believed to be the first gospel, the form critics looked for the addition of proper names for anonymous characters, indirect discourse being turned into direct quotation, and the elimination of Aramaic terms and forms, with details becoming more concrete in Matthew, and then more so in Luke. Instead, in the 1970s, New Testament scholar E. P. Sanders wrote that: &quot;There are no hard and fast laws of the development of the Synoptic tradition... On all counts the tradition developed in opposite directions. It became both longer and shorter, both more and less detailed, and both more and less Semitic&quot;.

Scholars from the 1970s and into the 1990s, produced an &quot;explosion of studies&quot; on structure, genre, text-type, setting and language that challenged several of form criticism&#x27;s aspects and assumptions. For example, the period of the twentieth century dominated by form criticism is marked by Bultmann&#x27;s extreme skepticism concerning what can be known about the historical Jesus and his sayings. Some form critics assumed these same skeptical presuppositions based largely on their understanding of oral transmission and folklore. During the latter half of the twentieth century, field studies of cultures with existing oral traditions directly impacted many of these presuppositions. In 1978, research by linguists Milman Parry and Albert Bates Lord was used to undermine Gunkel&#x27;s belief that &quot;short narratives evolved into longer cycles&quot;. Within these oral cultures, literacy did not replace memory in a natural evolution. Instead, writing was used to enhance memory in an overlap of written and oral tradition. Susan Niditch concluded from her orality studies that: &quot;no longer are many scholars convinced ... that the most seemingly oral-traditional or formulaic pieces are earliest in date&quot;. In this manner, compelling evidence developed against the form critical belief that Jesus&#x27;s sayings were formed by Christian communities. As John Niles indicates, the &quot;older idea of &#x27;an ideal folk community—an undifferentiated company of rustics, each of whom contributes equally to the process of oral tradition,&#x27; is no longer tenable&quot;. According to Eddy and Boyd, these various conclusions directly undermine assumptions about &quot;Sitz im leben:&quot; &quot;In light of what we now know of oral traditions, no necessary correlation between [the literary] forms and &quot;life situations&quot; [sitz im leben] can be confidently drawn&quot;.

Form critics assumed the early Church was heavily influenced by the Hellenistic culture that surrounded first-century Palestine, but in the 1970s, Sanders, as well as Gerd Theissen, sparked new rounds of studies that included anthropological and sociological perspectives, reestablishing Judaism as the predominant influence on Jesus, Paul, and the New Testament. New Testament scholar N. T. Wright says, &quot;The earliest traditions of Jesus reflected in the Gospels are written from the perspective of Second Temple Judaism [and] must be interpreted from the standpoint of Jewish eschatology and apocalypticism&quot;.

According to religion scholar Werner H. Kelber, form critics throughout the mid-twentieth century were so focused on finding each pericope&#x27;s original form, that they were distracted from any serious consideration of memory as a dynamic force in the construction of the gospels or the early church community tradition. What Kelber refers to as the &quot;astounding myopia&quot; of the form critics has revived interest in memory as an analytical category within biblical criticism.

For some, the many challenges to form criticism mean its future is in doubt. Bible scholar Tony Campbell says:

Form criticism had a meteoric rise in the early part of the twentieth century and fell from favor toward its end. For some, the future of form criticism is not an issue: it has none. But if form criticism embodies an essential insight, it will continue... Two concerns ... give it its value: concern for the nature of the text and for its shape and structure. ... If the encrustations can be scraped away, the good stuff may still be there.

=== Redaction criticism ===

&quot;Redaction&quot; is the process of editing multiple sources, often with a similar theme, into a single document. It was derived from a combination of both source and form criticism. As in source criticism, it is necessary to identify the traditions before determining how the redactor used them. Form critics saw the synoptic writers as mere collectors and focused on the &quot;Sitz im Leben&quot; as the creator of the texts, whereas redaction critics have dealt more positively with the Gospel writers, asserting an understanding of them as theologians of the early church. Redaction critics reject source and form criticism&#x27;s description of the Bible texts as mere collections of fragments. Where form critics fracture the biblical elements into smaller and smaller individual pieces, redaction critics attempt to interpret the whole literary unit.

Norman Perrin defines redaction criticism as &quot;the study of the theological motivation of an author as it is revealed in the collection, arrangement, editing, and modification of traditional material, and in the composition of new material ... redaction criticism directs us to the author as editor.&quot; Redaction criticism developed after World War II in Germany and arrived in England and North America by the 1950s. It focuses on discovering how and why the literary units were originally edited—&quot;redacted&quot;—into their final forms.

==== Redaction Critique ====
Redaction critics assume an extreme skepticism toward the historicity of Jesus and the gospels, just as form critics do, which has been seen by some scholars as a bias. The process of redaction seeks the historical community of the final redactors of the gospels, though there are often no textual clues. Porter and Adams say the redactive method of finding the final editor&#x27;s theology is flawed. In the New Testament, redaction critics attempt to discern the original author/evangelist&#x27;s theology by focusing and relying upon the differences between the gospels, yet it is unclear whether every difference has theological meaning, how much meaning, or whether any given difference is a stylistic or even an accidental change. Further, it is not at all clear whether the difference was made by the evangelist, who could have used the already changed story when writing a gospel. The evangelist&#x27;s theology more likely depends on what the gospels have in common as well as their differences. Harrington says, &quot;over-theologizing, allegorizing, and psychologizing are the major pitfalls encountered&quot; in redaction criticism.

Followers of other theories concerning the Synoptic problem, such as those who support the Greisbach hypothesis which says Matthew was written first, Luke second, and Mark third, have pointed to weaknesses in the redaction-based arguments for the existence of Q and Markan priority. Mark Goodacre says &quot;Some scholars have used the success of redaction criticism as a means of supporting the existence of Q, but this will always tend toward circularity, particularly given the hypothetical nature of Q which itself is reconstructed by means of redaction criticism&quot;.

=== Literary criticism ===
In the mid-twentieth century, literary criticism began to develop, shifting scholarly attention from historical and pre-compositional matters to the text itself, thereafter becoming the dominant form of biblical criticism in a relatively short period of about thirty years. It can be said to have begun in 1957 when literary critic Northrop Frye wrote an analysis of the Bible from the perspective of his literary background by using literary criticism to understand the Bible forms. Hans Frei proposed that &quot;biblical narratives should be evaluated on their own terms&quot; rather than by taking them apart in the manner we evaluate philosophy or historicity. Frei was one of several external influences that moved biblical criticism from a historical to a literary focus. New Testament scholar Paul R. House says the discipline of linguistics, new views of historiography, and the decline of older methods of criticism were also influential in that process.

By 1974, the two methodologies being used in literary criticism were rhetorical analysis and structuralism. Rhetorical analysis divides a passage into units, observes how a single unit shifts or breaks, taking special note of poetic devices, meter, parallelism, word play and so on. It then charts the writer&#x27;s thought progression from one unit to the next, and finally, assembles the data in an attempt to explain the author&#x27;s intentions behind the piece. Critics of rhetorical analysis say there is a &quot;lack of a well-developed methodology&quot; and that it has a &quot;tendency to be nothing more than an exercise in stylistics&quot;.

Structuralism looks at the language to discern &quot;layers of meaning&quot; with the goal of uncovering a work&#x27;s &quot;deep structures&quot; – the premises as well as the purposes of the author. In 1981 literature scholar Robert Alter also contributed to the development of biblical literary criticism by publishing an influential analysis of biblical themes from a literary perspective. The 1980s saw the rise of formalism, which focuses on plot, structure, character and themes and the development of reader-response criticism which focuses on the reader rather than the author.

New Testament scholar Donald Guthrie highlights a flaw in the literary critical approach to the Gospels: the genre of the Gospels has not been fully determined. No conclusive evidence has yet been produced to settle the question of genre, and without genre, no adequate parallels can be found, and without parallels &quot;it must be considered to what extent the principles of literary criticism are applicable&quot;. The validity of using the same critical methods for novels and for the Gospels, without the assurance the Gospels are actually novels, must be questioned.

==== Canonical criticism ====

As a type of literary criticism, canonical criticism has both theological and literary roots. Its origins are found in the Church&#x27;s views of the biblical writings as sacred, and in the secular literary critics who began to influence biblical scholarship in the 1940s and 1950s. By the mid-twentieth century, the high level of departmentalization in biblical criticism, with its large volume of data and absence of applicable theology, had begun to produce a level of dissatisfaction among both scholars and faith communities. Brevard S. Childs (1923–2007) proposed an approach to bridge that gap that came to be called canonical criticism. Canonical criticism &quot;signaled a major and enduring shift in biblical studies&quot;. Canonical criticism does not reject historical criticism, but it does reject its claim to &quot;unique validity&quot;. John Barton says that canonical criticism does not simply ask what the text might have originally meant, it asks what it means to the current believing community, and it does so in a manner different from any type of historical criticism.

John H. Hayes and Carl Holladay say &quot;canonical criticism has several distinguishing features&quot;: (1) Canonical criticism is synchronic; it sees all biblical writings as standing together in time instead of focusing on the diachronic questions of the historical approach. (2) Canonical critics approach the books as whole units instead of focusing on pieces. They accept that many texts have been composed over long periods of time, but the canonical critic wishes &quot;to interpret the &quot;last edition&quot; of a biblical book&quot; and then relate books to each other. (3) Canonical criticism opposes form criticism&#x27;s isolation of individual passages from their canonical setting. (4) Canonical criticism emphasizes the relationship between the text and its reader in an effort to reclaim the relationship between the texts and how they were used in the early believing communities. Canonical critics focus on reader interaction with the biblical writing. (5) &quot;Canonical criticism is overtly theological in its approach&quot;. Critics are interested in what the text means for the community—&quot;the community of faith whose predecessors produced the canon, that was called into existence by the canon, and seeks to live by the canon&quot;.

==== Rhetorical criticism ====

Rhetorical criticism is also a type of literary criticism. While James Muilenburg (1896–1974) is often referred to as &quot;the prophet of rhetorical criticism&quot;, it is Herbert A. Wichelns who is credited with &quot;creating the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism&quot; with his 1925 essay &quot;&quot;The Literary Criticism of Oratory&quot;.&quot; In that essay, Wichelns says that rhetorical criticism and other types of literary criticism differ from each other because rhetorical criticism is only concerned with &quot;effect. It regards a speech as a communication to a specific audience, and holds its business to be the analysis and appreciation of the orator&#x27;s method of imparting his ideas to his hearers&quot;. Rhetorical criticism is a qualitative analysis. This qualitative analysis involves three primary dimensions: (1) analyzing the act of criticism and what it does; (2) analyzing what goes on within the rhetoric being analyzed and what is created by that rhetoric; and (3) understanding the processes involved in all of it. Sonja K. Foss discusses ten different methods of rhetorical criticism in her book &quot;Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice&quot; saying that each method will produce different insights.

Biblical rhetorical criticism makes use of understanding the &quot;forms, genres, structures, stylistic devices and rhetorical techniques&quot; common to the Near Eastern literature of the different ages when the separate books of biblical literature were written. It attempts to discover and evaluate the rhetorical devices, language, and methods of communication used within the texts by focusing on the use of &quot;repetition, parallelism, strophic structure, motifs, climax, chiasm and numerous other literary devices&quot;. Phyllis Trible, a student of Muilenburg, has become one of the leaders of rhetorical criticism and is known for her detailed literary analysis and her feminist critique of biblical interpretation.

==== Narrative criticism ====

In the last half of the twentieth century, historical critics began to recognize that being limited to the historical meant the Bible was not being studied in the manner of other ancient writings. In 1974, Hans Frei pointed out that a historical focus neglects the &quot;narrative character&quot; of the gospels. Critics began asking if these texts should be understood on their own terms before being used as evidence of something else. According to Mark Allen Powell the difficulty in understanding the gospels on their own terms is determining what those terms are: &quot;The problem with treating the gospels &#x27;just like any other book&#x27; is that the gospels are not like any other book&quot;. The New Critics, (whose views were absorbed by narrative criticism), rejected the idea that background information holds the key to the meaning of the text, and asserted that meaning and value reside within the text itself. It is now accepted as &quot;axiomatic in literary circles that the meaning of literature transcends the historical intentions of the author&quot;.

As a form of literary criticism, narrative criticism approaches scripture as story. Christopher T. Paris says that, &quot;narrative criticism admits the existence of sources and redactions but chooses to focus on the artistic weaving of these materials into a sustained narrative picture&quot;.

Narrative criticism was first used to study the New Testament in the 1970s, with the works of David Rhoads, Jack D. Kingsbury, R. Alan Culpepper, and Robert C. Tannehill. A decade later, this new approach in biblical criticism included the Old Testament as well. The first article labeled &quot;narrative criticism&quot; was &quot;Narrative Criticism and the Gospel of Mark,&quot; published in 1982 by Bible scholar David Rhoads. Stephen D. Moore has written that &quot;as a term, narrative criticism originated within biblical studies&quot;, but its method was borrowed from narratology. It was also influenced by New Criticism which saw each literary work as a freestanding whole with intrinsic meaning. Sharon Betsworth says Robert Alter&#x27;s work is what adapted New Criticism to the Bible. Scholars such as Robert Alter and Frank Kermode sought to teach readers to &quot;appreciate the Bible itself by training attention on its artfulness—how [the text] orchestrates sound, repetition, dialogue, allusion, and ambiguity to generate meaning and effect&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Ken and Richard Soulen say that &quot;biblical criticism has permanently altered the way people understand the Bible&quot;. One way of understanding this change is to see it as a cultural enterprise. Jonathan Sheehan has argued that critical study meant the Bible had to become a primarily cultural instrument. It could no longer be a Catholic Bible or a Lutheran Bible but had to be divested of its scriptural character within specific confessional hermeneutics. As a result, the Bible is no longer thought of solely as a religious artifact, and its interpretation is no longer restricted to the community of believers. The Bible&#x27;s cultural impact is studied in multiple academic fields, producing not only the cultural Bible, but the modern academic Bible as well. Soulen adds that biblical criticism&#x27;s &quot;leading practitioners ... have set standards of industry, acumen, and insight that remain pace-setting today.&quot;

Biblical criticism made study of the Bible more secularized, scholarly, and democratic. It began to be recognized that &quot;Literature was written not just for the dons of Oxford and Cambridge, but also for common folk... Opposition to authority, especially ecclesiastical [church authority], was widespread, and religious tolerance was on the increase&quot;. Old orthodoxies were questioned and radical views tolerated. Scholars began writing in their common languages making their works available to a larger public.

In this way, biblical criticism also led to conflict. Many like Roy A. Harrisville believe biblical criticism was created by those hostile to the Bible. There are aspects of biblical criticism that have not only been hostile to the Bible, but also to the religions whose scripture it is, in both intent and effect. So biblical criticism became, in the perception of many, an assault on religion, especially Christianity, through the &quot;autonomy of reason&quot; which it espoused. Part of the legacy of biblical criticism is that, as it rose, it led to the decline of biblical authority. J. W. Rogerson summarizes: By 1800 historical criticism in Germany had reached the point where Genesis had been divided into two or more sources, the unity of authorship of Isaiah and Daniel had been disputed, the interdependence of the first three gospels had been demonstrated, and miraculous elements in the OT and NT [Old and New Testaments] had been explained as resulting from the primitive or pre-scientific outlook of the biblical writers. Jeffrey Burton Russell describes it thus: &quot;Faith was transferred from the words of scripture itself to those of influential biblical critics ... liberal Christianity retreated hastily before the advance of science and biblical criticism. By the end of the eighteenth century, advanced liberals had abandoned the core of Christian beliefs.&quot; This created an &quot;intellectual crisis&quot; in American Christianity of the early twentieth century which led to a backlash against the critical approach. This backlash produced a fierce internal battle for control of local churches, national denominations, divinity schools and seminaries.

On one hand, Rogerson says that &quot;historical criticism is not inherently inimical to Christian belief&quot;. On the other hand, as Michael Fishbane frankly wrote in 1992, &quot;No longer are we sustained within a biblical matrix... The labor of many centuries has expelled us from this edenic womb and its wellsprings of life and knowledge... [The] Bible has lost its ancient authority&quot;. The most profound legacy of the loss of biblical authority is the formation of the modern world itself, according to religion and ethics scholar Jeffrey Stout. &quot;There are those who regard the desacralization of the Bible as the fortunate condition for the rise of new sensibilities and modes of imagination&quot; that went into developing the modern world. For many, biblical criticism &quot;released a host of threats&quot; to the Christian faith. For others biblical criticism &quot;proved to be a failure, due principally to the assumption that diachronic, linear research could master any and all of the questions and problems attendant on interpretation&quot;. Still others believed that biblical criticism, &quot;shorn of its unwarranted arrogance,&quot; could be a reliable source of interpretation.

Fishbane asserts that the significant question for those who continue in any community of Jewish or Christian faith is, after 200 years of biblical criticism: can the text still be seen as sacred? &quot;[T]his question affects our innermost cultural being and traces our relationship to the foundational text of our religious and cultural origins&quot;. He compares biblical criticism to Job, a prophet who destroyed &quot;self-serving visions for the sake of a more honest crossing from the divine &quot;textus&quot; to the human one&quot;. Or as Rogerson says: biblical criticism has been liberating for those who want their faith &quot;intelligently grounded and intellectually honest&quot;.

Fishbane writes: the traditional sacrality of the Bible is at once simple and symbolic, individual and communal, practical and paradoxical. But times have changed... [In the twenty-first century,] [c]an the notion of a sacred text be retrieved? ... It is arguably one of Judaism&#x27;s greatest contributions to the history of religions to assert that the divine Reality is communicated to mankind through words... our hermeneutical hope is in the indissoluble link between the divine and human &quot;textus&quot;... It is at such points that the ancient theophanic power of illimitable divinity may yet breakthrough swollen words... Thus, ... we may say that the Bible itself may help to retrieve the notion of a sacred text.

By the end of the twentieth century, multiple new points of view changed biblical criticism&#x27;s central concepts and its goals, leading to the development of a group of new and different biblical-critical disciplines.

=== Non-liberal Protestant criticism ===
One legacy of biblical criticism in American culture is the American fundamentalist movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Fundamentalism began, at least partly, as a response to the biblical criticism of nineteenth century liberalism. Some fundamentalists believed liberal critics had invented an entirely new religion &quot;completely at odds with the Christian faith&quot;. There have also been conservative Protestants who accepted biblical criticism, and this too is part of biblical criticism&#x27;s legacy. William Robertson Smith (1846–1894) is an example of a nineteenth century evangelical who believed historical criticism was a legitimate outgrowth of the Protestant Reformation&#x27;s focus on the biblical text. He saw it as a &quot;necessary tool to enable intelligent churchgoers&quot; to understand the Bible, and was a pioneer in establishing the final form of the supplementary hypothesis of the documentary hypothesis. A similar view was later advocated by the Primitive Methodist biblical scholar A. S. Peake (1865–1929). Conservative Protestant scholars have continued the tradition of contributing to critical scholarship. Mark Noll says that &quot;in recent years, a steadily growing number of well qualified and widely published scholars have broadened and deepened the impact of evangelical scholarship&quot;. Edwin M. Yamauchi is a recognized expert on Gnosticism; Gordon Fee has done exemplary work in textual criticism; Richard Longenecker is a student of Jewish-Christianity and the theology of Paul. &quot;[It] is safe to conclude that in many measurable features contemporary evangelical scholarship on the scriptures enjoys a considerable good health&quot;.

=== Catholic criticism ===
Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Catholic theology avoided biblical criticism because of its reliance on rationalism, preferring instead to engage in traditional exegesis, based on the works of the Church Fathers. Notable exceptions to this included Richard Simon, Ignaz von Döllinger and the Bollandist.

The Church showed strong opposition to biblical criticism during that period. Frequent political revolutions, bitter opposition of &quot;liberalism&quot; to the Church, and the expulsion of religious orders from France and Germany, made the church understandably suspicious of the new intellectual currents. In his 1829 encyclical &quot;Traditi humilitati&quot;, Pope Pius VIII lashed against &quot;those who publish the Bible with new interpretations contrary to the Church&#x27;s laws&quot;, arguing that they were &quot;skillfully distort[ing] the meaning by their own interpretation&quot;, in order to &quot;ensure that the reader imbibes their lethal poison instead of the saving water of salvation&quot;. In 1864, Pope Pius IX promulgated the encyclical letter &quot;Quanta cura&quot; (&quot;Condemning Current Errors&quot;), which decried what the Pontiff considered significant errors afflicting the modern age. These he listed in an attachment called &quot;Syllabus Errorum&quot; (&quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;), which, among other things, condemned rationalistic interpretations of the Bible. Similarly, the dogmatic constitution &quot;Dei Filius&quot; (&quot;Son of God&quot;), approved by the First Vatican Council in 1871, rejected biblical criticism, reaffirming that the Bible was written by God and that it was inerrant.

That began to change in the final decades of the nineteenth century when, in 1890, the French Dominican Marie-Joseph Lagrange (1855–1938) established a school in Jerusalem called the &quot;École prátique d&#x27;études biblique&quot;, which became the &quot;École Biblique&quot; in 1920, to encourage study of the Bible using the historical-critical method. Two years later, Lagrange funded a journal (&quot;Revue Biblique&quot;), spoke at various conferences, wrote Bible commentaries that incorporated textual critical work of his own, did pioneering work on biblical genres and forms, and laid the path to overcoming resistance to the historical-critical method among his fellow scholars.

On 18 November 1893, Pope Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical letter &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot; (&#x27;The most provident God&#x27;). The letter gave the first formal authorization for the use of critical methods in biblical scholarship. &quot;Hence it is most proper that Professors of Sacred Scripture and theologians should master those tongues in which the sacred Books were originally written, and have a knowledge of natural science. He recommended that the student of scripture be first given a sound grounding in the interpretations of the Fathers such as Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilary, Ambrose, Leo the Great, Gregory the Great, Augustine and Jerome, and understand what they interpreted literally, and what allegorically; and note what they lay down as belonging to faith and what is opinion. Although &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot; tried to encourage Catholic biblical studies, it created also problems. In the encyclical, Leo XIII excluded the possibility of restricting the inspiration and inerrancy of the bible to matters of faith and morals. 

The situation precipitated after the election of Pope Pius X: a staunch traditionalist, Pius saw biblical criticism as part of a growing destructive modernist tendency in the Church. Thus, he explicitly condemned it in the papal syllabus &quot;Lamentabili sane exitu&quot; (&quot;With truly lamentable results&quot;) and in his papal encyclical &quot;Pascendi Dominici gregis&quot; (&quot;Feeding the Lord&#x27;s Flock&quot;), which labelled it as heretical. The École Biblique and the &quot;Revue Biblique&quot; were shut down and Lagrange was called back to France in 1912.

Following Pius&#x27;s death, Pope Benedict XV once again condemned rationalistic biblical criticism in his papal encyclical &quot;Spiritus Paraclitus&quot; (&quot;Paraclete Spirit, but also took a more moderate line than his predecessor, allowing Lagrange to return to Jerusalem and reopen his school and journal.

In 1943, on the fiftieth anniversary of the &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot;, Pope Pius XII issued the papal encyclical &quot;Divino Afflante Spiritu&quot; (&#x27;Inspired by the Holy Spirit&#x27;) sanctioning historical criticism, opening a new epoch in Catholic critical scholarship. The Jesuit Augustin Bea (1881–1968) had played a vital part in its publication. The dogmatic constitution &quot;Dei verbum&quot; (&quot;Word of God&quot;), approved by the Second Vatican Council and promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1965 furtherly sanctioned biblical criticism.

Raymond E. Brown, Joseph A. Fitzmyer and Roland E. Murphy were the most famous Catholic scholars to apply biblical criticism and the historical-critical method in analyzing the Bible: together, they authored &quot;The Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot; and &quot;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot; the later of which is still one of the most used textbooks in Catholic Seminaries of the United States. &quot;The Jerome Biblical Commentary for the Twenty-First Century&quot;, a third fully revised edition, will be published in 2022 and will be edited by John J. Collins, Gina Hens-Piazza, Barbara Reid and Donald Senior.

This tradition is continued by Catholic scholars such as John P. Meier, and Conleth Kearns, who also worked with Reginald C. Fuller and Leonard Johnston preparing &quot;A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture&quot;. Meier is also the author of a multi-volume work on the historical Jesus, &quot;A Marginal Jew&quot;.

=== Jewish criticism ===
Biblical criticism posed unique difficulties for Judaism. Some Jewish scholars, such as rabbinicist Solomon Schechter, did not participate in biblical criticism because they saw criticism of the Pentateuch as a threat to Jewish identity. The growing anti-semitism in Germany of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the perception that higher criticism was an entirely Protestant Christian pursuit, and the sense that many Bible critics were not impartial academics but were proponents of supersessionism, prompted Schechter to describe &quot;Higher Criticism as Higher Anti-semitism&quot;.

One of the earliest historical-critical Jewish scholars of Pentateuchal studies was M. M. Kalisch, who began work in the nineteenth century. In the early twentieth century, historical criticism of the Pentateuch became mainstream among Jewish scholars. In 1905, Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann wrote an extensive, two-volume, philologically based critique of the Wellhausen theory, which supported Jewish orthodoxy. Bible professor Benjamin D. Sommer says it is &quot;among the most precise and detailed commentaries on the legal texts [Leviticus and Deuteronomy] ever written&quot;. According to Aly Elrefaei, the strongest refutation of Wellhausen&#x27;s Documentary theory came from Yehezkel Kaufmann in 1937. Kaufmann was the first Jewish scholar to fully exploit higher criticism to counter Wellhausen&#x27;s theory. Wellhausen&#x27;s and Kaufmann&#x27;s methods were similar yet their conclusions were opposed. Mordechai Breuer, who branches out beyond most Jewish exegesis and explores the implications of historical criticism for multiple subjects, is an example of a twenty-first century Jewish biblical critical scholar.

=== Feminist criticism ===
Biblical criticism impacted feminism and was impacted by it. In the 1980s, Phyllis Trible and Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza reframed biblical criticism by challenging the supposed disinterest and objectivity it claimed for itself and exposing how ideological-theological stances had played a critical role in interpretation. For example, the patriarchal model of ancient Israel became an aspect of biblical criticism through the anthropology of the nineteenth century. Feminist scholars of second-wave feminism appropriated it. Third wave feminists began raising concerns about its accuracy. Carol L. Meyers says feminist archaeology has shown &quot;male dominance was real; but it was fragmentary, not hegemonic&quot; leading to a change in the anthropological description of ancient Israel as heterarchy rather than patriarchy.

Feminist criticism is an aspect of the feminist theology movement which began in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the feminist movement in the United States. Three phases of feminist biblical interpretation are connected to the three phases, or &#x27;waves&#x27;, of the movement. Feminist theology has since responded to globalization, making itself less specifically Western, thereby moving beyond its original narrative &quot;as a movement defined by the USA&quot;. Feminist criticism embraces the inter-disciplinary approach to biblical criticism, encouraging a reader-response approach to the text that includes an attitude of &quot;dissent&quot; or &quot;resistance&quot;.

=== Postcolonial biblical criticism ===

In the mid to late 1990s, a global response to the changes in biblical criticism began to coalesce as &quot;Postcolonial biblical criticism&quot;. Fernando F. Segovia and Stephen D. Moore postulate that it emerged from &quot;liberation hermeneutics, or extra-biblical Postcolonial studies, or even from historical biblical criticism, or from all three sources at once&quot;. It has a focus on the indigenous and local with an eye toward recovering those aspects of culture that Colonialism had erased or suppressed. The Postcolonial view is rooted in a consciousness of the geopolitical situation for all people, and is &quot;transhistorical and transcultural&quot;. According to Laura E. Donaldson, postcolonial criticism is oppositional and &quot;multidimensional in nature, keenly attentive to the intricacies of the colonial situation in terms of culture, race, class and gender&quot;.

=== African-American biblical criticism ===

Biblical criticism produced profound changes in African-American culture. Vaughn A. Booker writes that, &quot;Such developments included the introduction of the varieties of American metaphysical theology in sermons and songs, liturgical modifications [to accommodate] Holy Spirit possession presences through shouting and dancing, and musical changes&quot;. These changes would both &quot;complement and reconfigure conventional African American religious life&quot;.

Michael Joseph Brown writes that African Americans responded to the assumption of universality in biblical criticism by challenging it. He says all Bible readings are contextual, in that readers bring with them their own context: perceptions and experiences harvested from social and cultural situations. African-American biblical criticism is based on liberation theology and black theology, and looks for what is potentially liberating in the texts.

=== Queer biblical hermeneutics ===
According to Episcopalian priest and queer theologian Patrick S. Cheng (Episcopal Divinity School): &quot;Queer biblical hermeneutics is a way of looking at the sacred text through the eyes of queer people. It is important to understand the meaning of these terms in relation to the exegetical process.&quot;

=== Social scientific criticism ===
&quot;Social scientific criticism&quot; is part of the wider trend in biblical criticism to reflect interdisciplinary methods and diversity. It grew out of form criticism&#x27;s &quot;Sitz im Leben&quot; and the sense that historical form criticism had failed to adequately analyze the social and anthropological contexts which form critics claimed had formed the texts. Using the perspectives, theories, models, and research of the social sciences to determine what social norms may have influenced the growth of biblical tradition, it is similar to historical biblical criticism in its goals and methods and has less in common with literary critical approaches. It analyzes the social and cultural dimensions of the text and its environmental context.

=== New historicism ===
&quot;New historicism&quot; emerged as traditional historical biblical criticism changed. Lois Tyson says this new form of historical criticism developed in the 1970s. It &quot;rejects both traditional historicism&#x27;s marginalization of literature and New Criticism&#x27;s enshrinement of the literary text in a timeless dimension beyond history&quot;. Literary texts are seen as &quot;cultural artifacts&quot; that reveal context as well as content, and within New Historicism, the &quot;literary text and the historical situation&quot; are equally important&quot;.

=== Post-modern biblical criticism ===
&quot;Postmodern biblical criticism&quot; began after the 1940s and 1950s when the term &quot;postmodern&quot; came into use to signify a rejection of modern conventions. Many of these early postmodernist views came from France following World War II. Postmodernism has been associated with Sigmund Freud, radical politics, and arguments against metaphysics and ideology. It questions anything that claims &quot;objectively secured foundations, universals, metaphysics, or analytical dualism&quot;. Biblical scholar A. K. M. Adam says postmodernism has three general features: 1) it denies any privileged starting point for truth; 2) it is critical of theories that attempt to explain the &quot;totality of reality;&quot; and 3) it attempts to show that all &quot;ideals&quot; are grounded in ideological, economic or political self-interest.

===Post-critical interpretation ===
&quot;Post-critical interpretation&quot;, according to Ken and Richard Soulen, &quot;shares postmodernism&#x27;s suspicion of modern claims to neutral standards of reason, but not its hostility toward theological interpretation&quot;. It begins with the understanding that biblical criticism&#x27;s focus on historicity produced a distinction between the meaning of what the text says and what it is about (what it historically references). The biblical scholar Hans Frei wrote that what he refers to as the &quot;realistic narratives&quot; of literature, including the Bible, do not allow for such separation. Subject matter is identical to verbal meaning and is found in plot and nowhere else. &quot;As Frei puts it, scripture &#x27;simultaneously depicts and renders the reality (if any) of what it talks about&#x27;; its subject matter is &#x27;constituted by, or identical with, its narrative&quot;.

<doc id="517387" wikidata="Q1151606" url="?curid=517387" title="Nevalı Çori">
<text>Nevalı Çori (, ) was an early Neolithic settlement on the middle Euphrates, in Şanlıurfa Province, Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey. The site is known for having some of the world&#x27;s oldest known temples and monumental sculpture. Together with the earlier site of Göbekli Tepe, it has revolutionised scientific understanding of the Eurasian Neolithic period. The oldest domesticated Einkorn wheat was found there.

The settlement was located about 490 m above sea level, in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, on both banks of the Kantara stream, a tributary of the Euphrates.

==Excavation==
The site was examined from 1983 to 1991 in the context of rescue excavations during the erection of the Atatürk Dam below Samsat. Excavations were conducted by a team from the University of Heidelberg under the direction of Professor Harald Hauptmann. Together with numerous other archaeological sites in the vicinity, Nevalı Çori has since been inundated by the damming of the Euphrates.

==Archaeological chronology==

Nevalı Çori could be placed within the local relative chronology on the basis of its flint tools. The occurrence of narrow unretouched Byblos-type points places it on Oliver Aurenche&#x27;s Phase 3, i.e. early to middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). Some tools indicate continuity into Phase 4, which is similar in date to Late PPNB. An even finer chronological distinction within Phase 3 is permitted by the settlement&#x27;s architecture; the house type with underfloor channels, typical of Nevalı Çori strata I-IV, also characterises the &quot;Intermediate Layer&quot; at Çayönü, while the differing plan of the single building in stratum V, House 1, is more clearly connected to the buildings of the &quot;Cellular Plan Layer&quot; at Çayönü.

===Common date===
In terms of absolute dates, four radiocarbon dates have been determined for Nevalı Çori. Three are from Stratum II and date it with some certainty to the second half of the 9th millennium BC, which coincides with early dates from Çayönü and with Mureybet IVA and thus supports the relative chronology above. The fourth dates to the 10th millennium BC, which, if correct, would indicate the presence of an extremely early phase of PPNB at Nevalı Çori.

==Houses==

The settlement had five architectural levels. The excavated architectural remains were of long rectangular houses containing two to three parallel flights of rooms, interpreted as mezzanines. These are adjacent to a similarly rectangular ante-structure, subdivided by wall projections, which should be seen as a residential space. This type of house is characterized by thick, multi-layered foundations made of large angular cobbles and boulders, the gaps filled with smaller stones so as to provide a relatively even surface to support the superstructure. These foundations are interrupted every 1-1.5m by underfloor channels, at right angles to the main axis of the houses, which were covered in stone slabs but open to the sides. They may have served the drainage, aeration or the cooling of the houses. 23 such structures were excavated, they are strikingly similar to structures from the so-called channeled subphase at Çayönü.

An area in the northwest part of the village appears to be of special importance. Here, a cult complex had been cut into the hillside. It had three subsequent architectural phases, the most recent belonging to Stratum III, the middle one to Stratum II and the oldest to Stratum I. The two more recent phases also possessed a terrazzo-style lime cement floor, which did not survive from the oldest phase. Parallels are known from Cayönü and Göbekli Tepe. Monolithic pillars similar to those at Göbekli Tepe were built into its dry stone walls, its interior contained two free-standing pillars of 3 m height. The excavator assumes light flat roofs. Similar structures are only known from Göbekli Tepe so far.

Soundings cut to examine the western side of the valley also revealed rectilinear architecture in 2-3 layers.

==Sculpture and clay figurines==
The local limestone was carved into numerous statues and smaller sculptures, including a more than life-sized bare human head with a snake or sikha-like tuft. There is also a statue of a bird. Some of the pillars also bore reliefs, including ones of human hands. The free-standing anthropomorphic figures of limestone excavated at Nevalı Çori belong to the earliest known life-size sculptures. Comparable material has been found at Göbekli Tepe.

Several hundred small clay figurines (about 5 cm high), most of them depicting humans, have been interpreted as votive offerings. They were fired at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C, which suggests the development of ceramic firing technology before the advent of pottery proper.

==Bas relief==

A bas relief on a fragment of a limestone bowl depicts two humans and one tortoise-like creature dancing.

==Burials==
Some of the houses contained depositions of human skulls and incomplete skeletons.

<text>Cardiff is a hamlet in Onondaga County, New York, United States, located south of Syracuse. It was named after Cardiff, the capital of Wales.

It was the site of the William C. &quot;Stub&quot; Newell farm where the &quot;Cardiff Giant&quot;, a famous hoax, was &quot;discovered&quot; on October 16, 1869.

<doc id="517399" wikidata="Q17020252" url="?curid=517399" title="NACDA Directors' Cup">
<text>The NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup, known for sponsorship reasons as the NACDA Learfield Directors&#x27; Cup or simply as the Directors&#x27; Cup, is an award given annually by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to the colleges and universities in the United States with the most success in collegiate athletics. Points for the NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup are based on order of finish in various championships sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) or, in the case of Division I Football, media-based polls. A first-place finish in a sport earns 100 points, second place 90 points, third place 85 points, fourth place 80 points, and lesser values for lower finishes (exact numbers beyond fourth place depend on the sport and division. 

The award originated in 1993 and was presented to NCAA Division I schools only. In 1995, it was extended to Division II, Division III, and NAIA schools as well, then extended further to junior colleges in 2011 based on standings from the NATYCAA Cup. Each division receives its own award.

The physical award is a Waterford Crystal trophy. Prior to 2003, the sponsor of the NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup was retail merchandiser Sears, and the award was known as the Sears Cup. Beginning in the 2003–04 season, the sponsor was the United States Sports Academy. In 2007–08, Learfield Sports assumed the sponsorship of the Directors&#x27; Cup. Learfield Sports rebranded to Learfield IMG College in 2016 and to simply Learfield in 2021.

== History ==
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill won the award in its inaugural year, but then Stanford University won the Division I award for 25 straight years until the streak was broken in 2020–21 by the University of Texas. Texas repeated in 2022, Stanford regained the cup in 2023, and Texas won again in 2024.

In Division II, UC Davis won six of the first eight awards, but its athletic program moved to Division I in 2003 and Grand Valley State has won 16 of the 19 awards since as of 2024 (the title went unawarded for two years due to COVID-19). The only other current Division II member with an award is 1999 winner Adams State. All other Division II winners (Bakersfield, California Baptist, and Grand Canyon) are now members of Division I.

Williams College has had by far the most success in Division III, having won the Cup 22 of the 27 times it has been awarded for that division. The only other D-III member with more than one Cup is 2023 and 2024 winner Johns Hopkins.

The NAIA division was dominated by Simon Fraser University of British Columbia in its early years, but in 2002, SFU transferred most of its sports programs to Canada&#x27;s college athletics federation, then known as Canadian Interuniversity Sport and now as U Sports. SFU left U Sports in 2011 and has since become a full member of NCAA Division II. From 2004–05 to 2011–12, Azusa Pacific University assumed the mantle at the NAIA level, winning eight consecutive championships before moving to NCAA Division II in the 2012–13 season. Oklahoma City University has been the most successful school since that year, with three Directors&#x27; Cups in the 2010s and four overall.

For two-year colleges, Iowa Central Community College has been the most successful school, winning five of the 10 titles.

==Scoring system==
* NCAA Division I: Counts top 19 sports at each school with the following breakdowns:
** Four of which must be baseball, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball
** The next highest 15 sports scored for each institution, regardless of gender, will be used in the standings (except men&#x27;s water polo)
** For FBS Football: the top 25 teams are awarded points based on their final rank in the Coaches Poll. 26th place is considered a tie between every non-ranked bowl winner, and the next available rank is considered a tie between every non-ranked bowl loser.
* NCAA Division II: Counts top 15 sports at each school with the following breakdowns:
** Four of which must be baseball, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball
** The next highest 11 sports scored for each institution, regardless of gender, will be used in the standings (except men&#x27;s water polo)
* NCAA Division III: Counts top 18 sports at each school with the following breakdowns:
** Four of which must be men&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s soccer
** The next highest 14 sports scored for each institution, regardless of gender, will be used in the standings (except men&#x27;s water polo)
* NAIA: Counts top 13 sports at each school with the following breakdowns:
** Four of which must be men&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball
** The next highest 9 sports scored for each institution, regardless of gender, will be used in the standings
* Junior/Community Colleges: The highest scoring institution in the NATYCAA Cup standings among the NJCAA Scholarship, NJCAA Non-Scholarship, and State Associations divisions will be declared the Directors&#x27; Cup winner.
=== Tiebreaking ===
If two teams have the same number of points at the end of the season, the tiebreaker is the number of national championships won. If still tied the next tiebreaker is the number of second-place finishes, then third-place finishes and so on until one team wins. The tiebreaker is only used for first place.

=== Criticism ===
The scoring structure has been criticized for several reasons, especially due to the number of sports counted per division. Although the number of sports counted in the scoring is based on the average number of sports sponsored by a team in that division, certain schools offer many more or many fewer sports than that. For example, Stanford&#x27;s dominance at the Division I level is partially attributable to them sponsoring 36 sports teams (of which 31 are NCAA sports), the most in Division I outside of the Ivy League, which does not grant athletic scholarships, and Ohio State, which sponsors 37 sports teams (of which 32 are NCAA sports). This gives Stanford more opportunities to win titles than most other schools, especially considering that some of the sports Stanford sponsors are not played by very many other schools (5 out of 31 have championship fields under 20 teams, and one [namely men&#x27;s gymnastics] has fewer than 20 sponsoring schools), all but guaranteeing a substantial number of points for the few schools that do (NACDA awards significantly fewer points for teams that finish lower than fourth in sports with less competition, but the top four teams (except in 8-team and 4-team bracket sports) always receive 100, 90, 85, and 80 points respectively). Ohio State, which sponsors teams in more NCAA sports than Stanford (5 of which, like Stanford, have championship fields under 20 teams) has never won the Cup (Ohio State has finished second 3 times, third twice, fourth 3 times, and in the top ten 7 more times).

Another common criticism is the fact that four sports are required to be counted despite some schools not sponsoring those sports. While every Division I school sponsors men&#x27;s basketball, and all but two (The Citadel and VMI) sponsor women&#x27;s basketball, a significant number of D-I schools do not sponsor the other two &quot;mandatory counters&quot; of baseball and women&#x27;s volleyball. In the 2023–24 school year, 21 schools did not sponsor women&#x27;s volleyball and 53 did not sponsor baseball, giving those schools an inherent disadvantage as they must count a sport for which they are guaranteed to receive no points.

Other reasons for criticism are over the way NACDA awards points in &quot;National Collegiate&quot; sports, which are sports where Division I, II, and III schools all compete directly against each other instead of being separated. The NCAA considers National Collegiate championships equivalent to Division I, therefore Division III schools are allowed to grant athletic scholarships in those sports, but NACDA counts points earned in National Collegiate competitions toward whatever division a team primarily competes in. Similarly, several otherwise Division III schools compete in Division I for men&#x27;s ice hockey (despite Division III having its own ice hockey tournament), so there have been instances where two different Division III teams earn 100 points in the sport.

Multiple suggestions have been made to change the scoring system. Some of the most popular of these include making each sport worth a proportional number of points to the number of schools that compete in it, to get rid of the limit on the number of sports counted, then divide a school&#x27;s total points by the number of sports it sponsors, and to count the median number of teams per division instead of the average (the median number of teams at a Division I school, for example, is 16, which is substantially lower than the 19 sports that are currently counted). However, NACDA has never seriously considered any of these suggestions.

=== Past scoring system ===
From the creation of the award until the 2017–18 season the scoring was as follows:

* NCAA Division I: Counted up to 20 total sports at each school, with a maximum of 10 sports counted for each gender
* NCAA Division II: Counted up to 14 total sports at each school, with a maximum of 7 sports counted for each gender
* NCAA Division III: Counted up to 18 total sports at each school, with a maximum of 9 sports counted for each gender
* NAIA: Counted up to 12 total sports at each school, with a maximum of 6 sports counted for each gender
* Junior/Community Colleges: Same as current

==Past winners==

* Results for years and schools shown in &quot;italics&quot; represent current standings and are not yet final.
* These results are for the &quot;final&quot; standings, calculated after spring sports end.

===NCAA Division I===

Stanford and Florida are the only schools to finish within the top 10 every season. Stanford has never finished below second.

<text>The [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] 10-4 standard, &quot;Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions&quot;, was a list of two-letter country codes that were used by the U.S. Government for geographical data processing in many publications, such as the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;. The standard was also known as DAFIF 0413 ed 7 Amdt. No. 3 (November 2003) and as DIA 65-18 (Defense Intelligence Agency, 1994, &quot;Geopolitical Data Elements and Related Features&quot;). 

The FIPS 10-4 codes are similar to (but sometimes incompatible with) the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. The standard also includes codes for the top-level subdivision of the countries, similar to but usually incompatible with the ISO 3166-2 standard.

== History ==
On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency continued to maintain the FIPS 10-4 codes in an informal document titled &quot;Geopolitical Entities and Codes&quot; (GEC) until December 31, 2014, retiring the GEC on March 31, 2015.

On January 23, 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense released the first edition of &quot;Geopolitical Entities, Names and Codes&quot; (GENC), a U.S. federal government profile of ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2. GENC is designed to be compatible with ISO 3166 but reflect U.S. government diplomatic recognition and naming decisions by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names; it is intended to be the basis for a future U.S. national profile of the ISO standards.

<doc id="517404" wikidata="Q534290" url="?curid=517404" title="Murray–Darling basin">
<text>The Murray–Darling Basin is a large geographical area in the interior of southeastern Australia, encompassing the drainage basin of the tributaries of the Murray River, Australia&#x27;s longest river, and the Darling River, a right tributary of the Murray and Australia&#x27;s third-longest river. The Basin, which includes six of Australia&#x27;s seven longest rivers and covers around one-seventh of the Australian landmass, is one of the country&#x27;s most significant agricultural areas providing one-third of Australia&#x27;s food supply. Located west of the Great Dividing Range, it drains southwest into the Great Australian Bight and spans most of the states of New South Wales and Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, and parts of the states of Queensland (the lower third) and South Australia (the southeastern corner).

The Basin is in length, with the Murray River being long. Most of the basin is flat, low-lying and far inland, and receives little direct rainfall. The many rivers it contains tend to be long and slow-flowing, and carry a volume of water that is large only by Australian standards.

The Snowy Mountains Scheme provides some security of water flows to the Murray–Darling Basin, providing approximately 2,100 gigalitres (7.4×1010 cu ft) of water a year to the Basin for use in Australia&#x27;s irrigated agriculture industry, which is worth about A$3 billion per annum, representing more than 40% of the gross value of the nation&#x27;s agricultural production.

==The original inhabitants==
The Basin was once home to a large number of Aboriginal people whose traditional lifestyle and cultures were gradually altered by the arrival of Europeans, while others were outright killed by the settlers. Although some tribes organised resistance, such as the Maraura, whose territory lay around the Rufus River above Renmark and the Tanganekald near The Coorong, they were eventually either killed, exiled, or succumbed to disease.

==Native fauna==
The Murray–Darling Basin is home to many native animal species. The true numbers may not be known, but a fairly confident estimate has been made of these animals and the current status of their population. The study found that there were:

* 80 species of mammals, with 62 extinct and 10 endangered
* 55 species of frogs, with 18 endangered
* 46 species of snakes, with five endangered
* five species of turtles, with none endangered
* 34 species of fish, with up to half of them either threatened or of conservation significance

Historical records show that the previous abundances of fish provided a reliable food source. The bountiful fish became concentrated when the early stages of a flood left shallow water across the floodplain. Today, roughly 24 native freshwater fish and another 15-25 marine and estuarine species are existent in the Basin, a very low biodiversity.

===2018–2019 fish kill===
Over Christmas 2018 and January 2019 there were two mass deaths of fish in the waters of the Basin, the first numbering 10,000, the second in the hundreds of thousands. Species affected were Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch and bony herring. Some blamed the draining of water from the Menindee Lakes by WaterNSW, with only 2.5% of the original water volume in the lakes being left; after the first fish kill, both the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and WaterNSW blamed the ongoing drought affecting Australia, while the DPI blamed the second kill on a disruption of an algal bloom caused by a sudden fall in temperature.

===2023 fish kill===
In March 2023, millions of fish were reported dead along the Darling River at Menindee, following a heatwave. As the cleanup began, police attributed the cause to (naturally occurring) hypoxic blackwater. Initial investigations by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) included single water samples at six sites and were criticised as inadequate. Subsequently it was announced that the New South Wales government will treat the deaths as a &quot;pollution incident&quot;, thus giving the EPA greater investigative powers; earlier testing was described as being primarily intended to ensure public safety.

==Introduced species==
Four varieties of carp were used to stock up fish dams. Since then they have made their way into the river systems, where they spread quite quickly. Human introduction, possibly by anglers using small carp illegally as live bait, has also increased their distribution. These fish are very mobile, breed rapidly and can survive in very shallow water and through long periods of very low dissolved oxygen content.

Carp are a problem because they feed by sucking gravel from the riverbed and taking all the edible material off it, before returning the rest to the water. This stirs up all the sediment, reducing the quality of the water. A project for developing daughterless carp shows promise for eliminating carp from the river system.

Cane toads have entered the upper reaches of the Darling Basin and there are several reports of individuals being found further down the system. Cane toads compete with native amphibians and are toxic to native carnivores.

&quot;Phyla canescens&quot; has invaded wetlands and floodplains with heavy clay soils in the Murray–Darling Basin, to the detriment of the native vegetation; the plant does best in habitats that are inundated occasionally, although it cannot compete with the grass &quot;Paspalum distichum&quot; and the sedge &quot;Eleocharis plana&quot; in more heavily inundated sites.

==Physiography==
This area is one of the physiographic provinces of the larger East Australian Basins division, and encompasses the smaller Naracoorte Platform and Encounter Shelf physiographic sections.

Total water flow in the Murray–Darling Basin 1885 to the present has averaged around per year. This is the lowest rate of the world&#x27;s major river systems. About 6.0 percent of Australia&#x27;s total rainwater falls into the Basin. In most years only half of this quantity reaches the sea and in dry years much less. Estimated total annual flows for the Basin have ranged from in 1902 to in 1956. Despite the magnitude of the Basin, the hydrology of the streams within it is quite varied.

These waters are divided into four types:

* The Darling and Lachlan basins. These have extremely variable flows from year to year, with the smallest annual flow being typically as little as &quot;1 percent&quot; of the long-term mean and the largest often more than ten times the mean. Periods of zero flow in most rivers can extend to months and in the drier parts (Warrego, Paroo and Lower Darling Basins) to years. Flows in these rivers are not strongly seasonal. In the northern regions the majority of floods occur in the summer from monsoonal penetration. For most of the Darling and Lachlan catchments it is typical to see high or low flows begin in winter and extend to the following autumn (see El Niño). High water extraction rates for irrigation and mining have heavily compromised these rivers.
* The southwestern basins (Campaspe, Loddon, Avoca, Wimmera). These have a marked winter rainfall maximum and relatively lower precipitation variability than the Lachlan or Darling. However, the age and infertility of the soils mean that run-off ratios are exceedingly low (for comparison, &quot;around a tenth that of a European or North American catchment with a similar climate&quot;). Thus, variability of runoff is very high and most of the terminal lakes found in these basins very frequently dry up. Almost all runoff occurs in the winter and spring and, in the absence of large dams for regulation, these rivers are often seasonally dry during summer and autumn.
* A number of small catchments in South Australia, of which the largest are the Angas River flowing through Strathalbyn and the Finniss River further west, are part of the Murray–Darling Basin. These catchments lead to Lake Alexandrina, one of the lakes at the end of the Murray system. The Angas River is often dry in summer because of high levels of water extraction. The Finniss River has permanent flow into Lake Alexandrina but was cut off by a weir for several years of drought in the early 21st century.
* The Murray, Murrumbidgee and Goulburn (except the Broken River which resembles the southwestern basins) basins. Because these catchments have headwaters in alpine country with relatively young peaty soils, the runoff ratios are much higher than in other parts of the Basin. Consequently, although gross precipitation variability is &quot;no lower&quot; than in the Lachlan or Darling basins, runoff variability is markedly lower than in other parts of the Basin. Typically these rivers never cease to flow and the smallest annual flow is around 30 percent of the long-term mean and the largest around three times the mean. In most cases the flow peaks very strongly with the spring snow melt and troughs in mid-autumn.

The two principal rivers of the Basin, the Murray and Darling, bring water from the high ranges of the east and carry it west then south through long flat and dry inland areas, often resulting in alluvial channel wetlands, such as The (Great) Cumbung Swamp, at the terminus of the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers. Nevertheless, these waters are subject to major diversions for municipal drinking supplies and irrigated agriculture that began in the 1890s. Currently, 4 major reservoirs, 14 lock and weir structures, and five coastal barrages interject the water flowing down the Murray–Darling. Of the approximately of flow in the Basin, which studies have shown to be divertible, are removed for irrigation, industrial use, and domestic supply. Agricultural irrigation accounts for about 95 percent of the water removed, including for the growing of rice and cotton. This extraction is highly controversial among scientists in Australia, regarding the agriculture industry&#x27;s high water use in a region extremely short of water (as much due to exceptionally low run-off coefficients as to low rainfall). These extensive irrigation systems require a reliable supply of water, not the unpredictable flows that characterise the Murray–Darling. These structures and irrigation implements were ideal when there was a steady flow of water. However, during &quot;the Big Dry&quot;, as the early 2000s drought came to be known, Australian farmers experienced a scarcity unlike ever before. The drought was so severe that numerous rivers and streams such as the Murray–Darling stopped flowing. The Basin contains more than 30,000 wetlands. Eleven of these are protected under the Ramsar Convention of Wetlands of International Importance.

===Rivers in the Murray–Darling Basin===
The rivers listed below comprise the Murray–Darling Basin and its direct significant tributaries, with elevations of their confluence with the downstream river. The tributary with the highest elevation is Swampy Plain River that rises in the Snowy Mountains, below Mount Kosciuszko at an elevation of , and ends merging with the Murray River, descending .

The ordering of the Basin, from downstream to upstream, is:

==Murray–Darling Basin Initiative==
===Background===
The Basin affects five states and territory governments, which according to the Constitution, are responsible for managing water resources. The River Murray Commission was established in 1917. Under the River Murray Waters Agreement, which did not include Queensland though about a quarter of the Basin lays in the state, the commission was an advisory body with no authority for enforcement of provisions. For a long time the commission was only concerned with water quantity until salinity became a problem. This led to minor reforms in 1982 in which water quality became part of the commission&#x27;s responsibilities.

However, it was soon recognised that a new organisational structure which considered the national perspective was needed for effective management. The Murray–Darling Basin Agreement was first adopted in 1985 but it wasn&#x27;t until 1993 that its full legal status was enacted. The Agreement led to the creation of a number of new organisations under what is known as the Murray–Darling Basin Initiative. These included the Murray–Darling Basin Ministerial Council and the Murray–Darling Basin Commission.

===Murray–Darling Basin Plan===
The Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) was formed in 2008 to manage the Murray–Darling Basin in an integrated and sustainable manner. The MDBA is responsible for preparing and overseeing a legally-enforceable management plan. In October 2010, MDBA released a draft Murray–Darling Basin Plan (MDBP) for consultation. On 22nd November 2012, Tony Burke signed the Murray–Darling Basin Plan, which passed the Australian Parliament&#x27;s disallowance period on 19 March 2013.

====Community consultation====
The MDBA&#x27;s draft Murray–Darling Basin Plan, titled the &quot;Guide to the Proposed Murray–Darling Basin Plan&quot;, was released in October 2010 as the first part of a three-stage process to address the problems of the Murray–Darling Basin. The Plan was in response to the 2000s Australian drought, and designed to secure the long-term ecological health of the Murray–Darling Basin. This entailed cutting existing water allocations and tree growth environmental flows. The Basin Plan was designed to set environmentally sustainable limits on the quantities of water that may be taken from Basin water resources, to set Basin-wide environmental, water quality and salinity objectives, to develop efficient water trading regimes across the Basin, to set requirements for state water resource plans and to improve water security for all Basin users. It also intends to minimise social and economic impacts whilst achieving the plan&#x27;s environmental outcomes.

With the release of the &quot;Guide to the Proposed Murray–Darling Basin Plan&quot; there have been a number of protests and voiced concerns about the plan in rural towns that the MDBA visited to present the plan to consultation meetings. More than 5,000 people attended a MDBA meeting in Griffith where Griffith Mayor, Mike Neville, said the plan would &quot;obliterate&quot; Murrumbidgee valley communities. Other groups also echo this feeling, such as the Victorian Farmers Federation and Wine Group Growers&#x27; Australia. Conversely, support for the Murray–Darling Basin plan has been received by various groups, including Australian Conservation Foundation, and Environment Victoria.

New legal advice from Commonwealth government lawyers is changing the plan. The Government&#x27;s interpretation is that the plan must give equal weight to the environmental, social, and economic impacts of proposed cuts to irrigation.

Environmentalists and South Australian irrigators, at the end of the river in South Australia, say that the authority should stick to its original figure.

In October 2010, a parliamentary inquiry into the economic impacts of the plan was announced.

In late October 2010 the Water Minister, Tony Burke, played down the prospect of a High Court challenge to the Murray–Darling Basin plan, as confusion continued over new legal advice released by the Government. In response to community concerns that MDBA had put environmental issues first over social and economic needs, Burke released new advice on the requirements of the &quot;Water Act&quot;. Burke stated that the Act does allow for the authority to &quot;optimise&quot; the needs of all three areas, but constitutional lawyer, George Williams, had cast doubts over the interpretation of the laws, stating it could be subject to a legal challenge.

The MDBA announced in November 2010 that it might be forced to push back the release of its final plan for the river system until early 2012.

The then MDBA chairman, Mike Taylor, reassured the public meeting that more work is being done to look at how the proposed cuts would affect regional communities. He stated: &quot;Importantly, we want to make sure the social and economic impacts—which under any sort of scenario is very significant—were fully teased out&quot;. Taylor resigned as he allegedly believed that the overriding principle should be the environmental outcome which was in conflict with the Gillard Government and following a period of sustained criticism of the Authority and the implementation of the proposed draft Basin plan. He was replaced by former New South Wales Planning Minister, Craig Knowles.

In late May 2012, the revised plan was forwarded to state water ministers. It did not alter the recommendation to cut of water entitlements.

Following much negotiation between the Commonwealth and State governments and numerous submissions from interested stakeholders and the community, the Basin Plan became law in November 2012 and can now be implemented.

<text>Thomas Gerard Weinandy (born January 12, 1946, in Delphos, Ohio) is an American Roman Catholic priest and a leading scholar. He is a prolific writer in both academic and popular works, including articles, books, and study courses.

==Biography==
Weinandy entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in 1966, was solemnly professed in 1970, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1972. He earned a BA in philosophy at St. Fidelis College, Herman, Pennsylvania, in 1969, an MA in systematic theology at Washington Theological Union in 1972, and a doctorate in historical theology at King&#x27;s College London in 1975. He lived in and was an active member of the Mother of God Community, Washington, for 14 years before leaving to teach at Oxford University.

His major fields of specialty are history of Christology, especially patristic, medieval and contemporary, history of trinitarian theology, history of soteriology, and philosophical notions of God. He has held academic positions at Georgetown University, Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland, Franciscan University of Steubenville, and Loyola College, Baltimore. Weinandy served at the University of Oxford from 1991 to 2005.

He was the Warden of Greyfriars (1993–2004; Honorary Fellow 2004) and tutor and lecturer in history and doctrine in the Faculty of Theology. He was chairman of the Faculty of Theology from 1997 to 1999. He is a member of the Catholic Theological Society of America, the Fellowship of Catholic Scholars, the Catholic Theological Society of Great Britain, the North American Patristics Society and the Association Internationale D&#x27;Etudes Patristiques, as well as the Academy of Catholic Theology. Since 2005, he has been the executive director of the Secretariat for Doctrine and Pastoral Practices of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), until he was replaced in early 2013. The Secretariat provides staff support for USCCB Committees on Doctrine, on Pastoral Practices, and on Science and Human Values, as well as for Ad Hoc Committees on Health Care Issues and the Review of Scripture Translations.

The Human Origins Initiative of the Smithsonian Institution invited Weinandy to participate as a member of the Broader Social Impacts Committee, made up of individuals from diverse religious communities, to reflect publicly on the exhibition ‘What Does It Mean To Be Human?’ and on human origins.

In October 2010, Weinandy participated in the Seventh Round of the Catholic-Reformed Dialogue concluded in Henryville, Indiana. That dialogue was jointly sponsored by the USCCB Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs, the Christian Reformed Church in North America, the Presbyterian Church-USA, the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ.

Weinandy assisted in the development of content for an iPhone app to guide Catholics through the act of confession, understood to be the first endorsed by the U.S. Catholic Church. &quot;It has been approved by Bishop Kevin Rhoades&quot;, said Weinandy.

In March 2011, Weinandy participated in a telephone press conference with scholars from Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish backgrounds the day before the release of Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week&quot;. Weinandy said that Pope Benedict &quot;sees Jesus as someone the world is longing to meet, and he’s doing his best to try to provide that opportunity.&quot;

In a May 2011 address to the Academy of Catholic Theology in Washington, DC, Weinandy, warned of a &quot;crisis&quot; in Catholic theology, precipitated by theologians who &quot;often appear to possess little reverence for the mysteries of the faith as traditionally understood and presently professed within the church.&quot; The Secretariat for Doctrine had previously criticized a book on the Trinity by St. Joseph Sr. Elizabeth Johnson of Fordham University in New York, leading to a defense of Johnson by many theologians as well as Fordham faculty. Weinandy&#x27;s address did not mention any theologian by name. &quot;Theology may be the only academic pursuit where one can seemingly be considered a theologian without actually having to know the subject matter,&quot; he said. &quot;It would appear at times that a theologian need not actually know God.&quot; Describing the theological crisis, Weinandy said: &quot;Much of what passes for contemporary Catholic theology, often is not founded upon an assent of faith in the divine deposit of revelation as proclaimed in the sacred scriptures and developed within the living doctrinal and moral tradition of the church.&quot;

Weinandy responded to a July 2012 article in Newsweek written by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss describing how confirmation of existence of the Higgs Boson particle could get rid of the idea of a supernatural creator permanently. &quot;While the Higgs particle may help us in understanding the relationship between mass and matter, it does not explain why the Higgs particle itself exists,&quot; Weinandy said. &quot;There must be a being whose very nature demands that it exists and, because of this, is able to bring other beings into existence.&quot;

Pope Francis honored Weinandy with the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for his work on behalf of the Pontiff and the Church, one of the highest honors in the Catholic Church, in 2013.

Weinandy teaches at the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, DC, and the Gregorian University in Rome.

In 2014, Pope Francis appointed Weinandy to the International Theological Commission for a five-year term.

In 2017, Weinandy wrote a letter charging that Francis is fostering &quot;chronic confusion&quot;, &quot;demeaning&quot; the importance of doctrine, appointing bishops who &quot;scandalize&quot; believers with dubious &quot;teaching and pastoral practice&quot;, giving prelates who object the impression they will be &quot;marginalized or worse&quot; if they speak out, causing many faithful Catholics to &quot;lose confidence in their supreme shepherd&quot;. Weinandy resigned from his position as consultant to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; Committee on Doctrine.

==Publications==
Some of his books on religion have been translated into several languages including Romanian and Polish. He has also published many scholarly articles in various journals including &quot;The Thomist&quot;, &quot;New Blackfriars&quot;, &quot;Communio&quot;, &quot;First Things&quot;, &quot;Pro Ecclesia&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the &quot;International Journal of Systematic Theology&quot;. He has written many popular articles including those for &quot;New Covenant&quot;, &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, &quot;Pastoral Life&quot;, &quot;Canadian Catholic Review&quot;, &quot;New Oxford Review&quot;, the &quot;Arlington Catholic Herald&quot;, and &quot;The Family&quot;.

Weinandy is one of many distinguished contributors to &quot;Benedict XVI: Essays and Reflections on His Papacy&quot;. His essay &quot;Hope for Today&quot; says “[Pope Benedict] perceives that all men and women today both desperately need hope and search for a reason for hope. He is convinced that true authentic hope is found in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”
