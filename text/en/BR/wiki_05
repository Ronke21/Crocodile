<text>Francis-Xavier de Montmorency-Laval, commonly referred to as François de Laval (; 30 April 1623 – 6 May 1708), was a French Catholic prelate who served as Apostolic Vicar of New France from 1658 to 1674 and as Bishop of Quebec from its creation in 1674 until he retired due to poor health in 1688. He continued to work in New France until his death in 1708. 

Among his accomplishments was the founding of the Séminaire de Québec in 1663. Laval was a member of the Montmorency family, but renounced his rights as heir so he could pursue his ecclesiastical career.

He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 June 1980 and Pope Francis declared him a saint on 3 April 2014.

==Early life==
Laval was born on 30 April 1623 in Montigny-Sur-Avre in the ancient Province of Perche, now the Department of Eure-et-Loir. His father Hugues de Laval, a member of the House of Laval, was the Seigneur of Montigny, Montbaudry, Alaincourt and Revercourt. His mother Michelle de Péricard was from a family of hereditary officers of the Crown in Normandy. Despite his family&#x27;s heritage, his parents were not considered to be wealthy. Montigny was considered equivalent to a good-sized market-town. Laval had five brothers and two sisters. His youngest brother Henri entered the Benedictine Order and his sister Anne Charlotte entered the Congregation of Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

Laval&#x27;s mother served as an example of piety and encouraged him to be charitable to those who were less fortunate. Often described as destined for an ecclesiastical lifestyle, Laval was recognized as a clear-sighted and intelligent boy and he was admitted into the &quot;privileged ranks of those who comprised the Congregation of the Holy Virgin.&quot; This was a society founded by the Jesuits, who aimed to inspire young people to adopt religious lifestyles, and encouraged regular prayer and spiritual practices. At the age of eight, Laval received the tonsure and took minor orders, which then allowed him to enter the College of La Flèche in 1631, an institution that educated the sons of the elite families and guaranteed him a good education. There Laval came into contact with reports of the Jesuit missions to the Huron in Canada, which inspired him to become a missionary, like his patron saint Francis Xavier. 

In 1637, Laval was appointed a canon of the Cathedral of Évreux by the Bishop of Évreux. The death of Laval&#x27;s father in September 1636 left his family in a precarious financial situation. François received revenue from the prebend attached to his position as a canon, which allowed him to continue his education. Once he completed his classical education at the age of nineteen, Laval left La Flèche to study philosophy and theology at the College de Clermont in Paris.

However the death of his two oldest brothers in the battles at Nördlingen in 1634 and Freiburg in 1644 made him the head of the family. His mother, the Bishop of Évreux, and his cousin all argued he should abandon his ecclesiastical career. Instead Laval helped his mother settle the family&#x27;s affairs and renounced his rights of primogeniture, which then passed to his brother Jean-Louis.

Laval returned to his studies in Paris and on 1 May 1647 he was ordained a priest. The Bishop of Évreux, regretting his earlier attempt to persuade Laval to change his career path, appointed him archdeacon of his diocese in December 1647. In this post Laval oversaw 155 parishes and four chapels. Laval was said to approach this task with fervour and enthusiasm. In the following years, he devoted himself to establishing order in the parishes, providing relief for the poor, caring for the sick, and engaging in various charitable activities. In 1654, presented with the possibility of serving as a missionary in Asia, he resigned as archdeacon, but the project was abandoned and he was left without a clerical position.

Freed of all responsibility, Laval spent three years at a spiritual retreat near Caen known as the Hermitage, founded by Jean de Bernières de Louvigny, a lay leader in the reform of the Catholic Church in France. There he also made the acquaintance of the founder&#x27;s nephew, Henri de Bernières, who became an invaluable assistant in later years. In addition to prayer and charitable work, he took on the responsibility of reforming a monastery whose morals were thought to be too lax and became the administrator of two monasteries of nuns. His dedication to these projects earned him commendation from François de Servien, Bishop of Bayeux, who described him as a priest &quot;of great piety, prudent and of unusually great competence in business matters, [who had set] fine examples of virtue&quot;.

==New France==
===Background===

New France had no bishop for the first 50 years of its European settlement. Colonial religious officials, either Recollects or Jesuits, managed spiritual affairs. In 1646, under pressure from Rome, the Archbishop of Rouen was recognized as the authority over the Church in New France, but his authority was limited to granting faculties to clergy traveling to the colony. Yet no one denied the need for an established ecclesiastical presence.

Appointing a bishop was a contentious issue disputed between the Jesuits and the newly arrived Sulpicians. The former were quite accustomed to working independently and they believed a Sulpician bishop would make the Church in the colony subordinate to the Crown. The Sulpicians proposed one of their own, Gabriel Thubières de Levy de Queylus, as bishop, while the Jesuits supported Laval and gained royal approval easily with the support of the queen mother, Anne of Austria. Securing papal confirmation was another challenge. 

The Holy See remained reserved regarding Laval&#x27;s nomination, as the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith wanted to assert papal authority in the colony rather than allow the Jesuits to exercise control in a new diocese that was part of the ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in France. Instead of naming Laval bishop of the diocese of New France, he was made a bishop of a newly created apostolic vicariate, a type of jurisdiction directly managed by the Holy See through the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith: the Apostolic Vicariate of New France.

===Vicariate of New France===
On 3 June 1658, the papal bulls were signed appointing Laval vicar apostolic of New France and titular bishop of Petra in Palestina. On 8 December 1658, in the church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris, Laval received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Celio Piccolomini, Apostolic Nuncio to France, assisted by Bishop Hardouin de Péréfixe de Beaumont of Rodez and Bishop André du Saussay of Toul as co-consecrators. Laval took an oath of loyalty to the French king and sailed from La Rochelle for New France on 13 April 1659. On 16 June he arrived at Quebec. He began work immediately and on the day he arrived he baptized a young Huron and gave a dying man his last sacraments.

While small in size, the colony still provided a number of challenges to Laval. He found himself having to make concessions where he never thought to before to a population that, while scarce, was spread out, and was less inclined to continue under strict church discipline. Additionally, he had to deal with the Sulpician de Queylus, who had been managing Church affairs in the colony as vicar general under the authority of the Archbishop of Rouen, who continued to claim ecclesiastical jurisdiction over New France. De Queylus continued to assert his authority for nearly two years, while Laval repeatedly appealed to the king and the Holy See for support.

Laval struggled a great deal throughout his career to defend the church&#x27;s power against state intrusion. Upon his arrival, Laval was adamant in asserting his primacy over the governor. He was immediately in opposition with Governor d’Argenson, particularly regarding ceremony and protocol. Also, the issue of selling alcohol to the natives further fueled their feud. Laval believed that intoxicated natives were an embarrassment to the colony and endangered the lives of those around them. He quickly imposed the threat of excommunication on those who continued to deal in this trade. Governor D’Argenson abhorred this action, deeming it an intrusion of church into state affairs. D’Argenson soon resigned and was replaced by d’Avaugour, who, in order to avoid any conflict with Laval, decreed harsh penalties against anyone caught selling alcohol to the natives. Again, Laval was displeased, believing that excommunication was a far more humane consequence. When alcohol was again being sold freely to natives, in a moment of despair over the state of New France, Laval departed for France in August 1662 to consult with Louis XIV on the matter. Laval succeeded in bringing about d’Avaugour&#x27;s recall the following year.

When Laval returned to New France he had increased powers. King Louis XIV had assured Laval that he would have a future appointment as bishop, requested that he establish a Sovereign Council in Quebec, and even asked Laval to choose New France&#x27;s next governor. For governor, Laval chose Chevalier de Mézy, a friend from his time at the Hermitage of Caen. In the developing Sovereign Council, which held its first session 18 September 1663, Mézy represented the first figure of authority, followed by Laval, and Gaudais-Dupon, commissioner. Laval appointed Mézy hoping to have an ally among high-ranking state official. In the trade of alcohol to the natives he did find in Mézy an ally; together the two forbade the trading of alcohol. However, constituting the Sovereign Council revealed that the two represented conflicting interests in matters of church and state. Soon, another conflict between Laval and governor ensued, leading Laval to take to the streets with drums to tell his version of the feud. Upon Mézy&#x27;s death, the Sovereign council was reorganized. Intendant Jean Talon was added, and immediately assumed the functions previously exercised by Laval. With this change in the council Laval began to attend the council&#x27;s meetings less frequently; from then on Laval retreated somewhat from state affairs and focused purely on ecclesiastical matters.

One of Laval&#x27;s principal projects as apostolic vicar was the education and training of priests and church administrators. The Major Seminary of Quebec opened on 26 March 1663. Affiliated with the Séminaire des Missions Étrangères, in Paris. In October 1668, Laval added a minor seminary to train boys It was meant to train boys who might have priestly vocation both of French and indigenous origins. It opened with eight French students and six Huron, but grew quickly as French missionaries, especially Sulpicians, arrived to serve as teachers. Laval wanted these teachers to spread the word that his institution was to establish a sense of charity and love for religion in the colony and not another source of law or authority.

Laval&#x27;s view of the Grand Séminaire was greater than a mere teaching academy. He hoped that it would become a home for all parochial priests. Laval encouraged them to see it as their true home and as a place to which they may turn to in sickness or old age. Furthermore, he wanted the seminary to become a paymaster for all priests and parishes, which meant that it had to be well funded. In order to accomplish this feat, Laval donated most of his own fortune to the seminary since it had now become his home as well. He also convinced the king, Louis XIV, to give him the income of three different abbeys in France. Moreover, since his institution was expected to pay off all priests, Laval thought it would be normal to receive the incomes levied by their parishes. This idea was however met with a lot of resistance from the population, which was not accustomed to contributing to the upkeep of religious institutions. His original goal of demanding a tax worth one-thirteenth of the produce of farms was met with violent resistance, which forced him to reduce it to one-twenty-sixth.

Laval shared a large part of his administrative work with other clerics to develop their experience. To lead the seminary he appointed his companion from France, Henri de Bernière, linking this role with Bernière&#x27;s other assignment a pastor of the parish of Quebec. Furthermore, he also appointed five other directors who would form the bishop&#x27;s advisory body. 

In 1668 he appointed the previously troublesome de Queylus as the first Superior of a new seminary in Ville-Marie. Around the same time he founded a school of arts and crafts at Saint-Joachim to provide practical education for craftsmen and farmers.

==Diocese of Quebec==
In 1674, fifteen years after his arrival in New France, Laval asked that the vicariate be promoted to a diocese. The Holy See established the Diocese of Quebec on 1 October 1674, naming Laval as its first bishop.

He revisited the issue of alcohol sales to the indigenous peoples. In 1675, Laval, over the objections of Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac, excommunicated all who sold alcohol to them. On 24 May 1679 Laval succeeded in obtaining a royal decree banning the trade.

In 1678, he obtained a royal edict stating that permanent curacies would be established in the colony. In 1681, he drew up the boundaries of parishes.

==Retirement==
Laval eventually realised that his health was declining and that he could no longer run his large diocese, which extended from Acadia to Lake Michigan. In 1688, he passed on his responsibilities as bishop to Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier.

Laval continued to collaborate with the colony&#x27;s high religious authorities, until his last days. He helped the poor with his presence and his gifts of charity. He never missed a Mass or a day of fasting, despite his ever declining health. By 1707, he had developed an ulcer which eventually took his life on 6 May 1708. His body was placed in a coffin in the cathedral; however his heart was kept in the chapel of the seminary to which he had dedicated most of his life and fortune.

==Veneration==

Laval&#x27;s remains have been entombed in a shrine for personal veneration in the Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Québec. His cause was formally opened on 24 September 1890, granting him the title of Servant of God. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1980. He was granted Equivalent canonization on 3 April 2014 by Pope Francis.

In 1663, Laval founded Séminaire de Québec and in 1852 it was named renamed to Université Laval in his honour. The city of Laval, Quebec, immediately north of Montreal, is also named after him.

<doc id="510889" wikidata="Q2470892" url="?curid=510889" title="USS Roi">
<text>USS &quot;Roi&quot; (CVE-103) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Battle of Roi, in which the United States captured the island of Roi-Namur. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in June 1944, commissioned in July, and acted as a transport and as a replenishment carrier. During the latter months of the war, she provided aircraft and supplies to the Fast Carrier Task Force, continuing until the end of the war. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in May 1946, and she was sold for scrapping in December.

==Design and description==
&quot;Roi&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses in the early engagements of the Pacific War. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Because &quot;Roi&quot; was never utilized in a combat operation, she usually operated with about 60 aircraft on board, the maximum carrying capacity at which take-offs would still be possible.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Alava Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed &quot;Roi&quot;, after the capture of the island Roi-Namur during the Battle of Kwajalein, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. The escort carrier was laid down on 3 March 1944, MC hull 1140, the forty-ninth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-103. She was launched on 2 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. William Sinton; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 6 July 1944, with Captain Percy Haverly Lyon in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Roi&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She then underwent several transport missions, first departing from San Diego on 13 August, carrying a load of 287 passengers and 71 aircraft bound for Manus Island and Espiritu Santo. She returned to port on 27 September, and conducted another transport run to Manus on 21 October. On 2 December, she made another transport run, making stops at Guam and Eniwetok. After completing her mission, she arrived at Alameda, California for overhaul. After overhaul was completed, she made two more round-trip transport missions to bases in the Marshalls and Mariana Islands. She then headed for Pearl Harbor, where she underwent training operations. There, she was also assigned to become a replenishment carrier supporting the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force, providing replacement aircraft, supplies, and fuel for the fleet carriers. The replenishment carrier fleet enabled the fast carriers to operate at sea for a sustained period of time without having to return to port to replenish.

After loading 61 replenishment aircraft, she sailed for Guam, where she joined Task Force 30.8, the replenishment escort carrier task group. She rendezvoused with the Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Group 38) on designated days, in order to replace losses sustained in operations against mainland Japan. She began operations on 4 July 1945, along with fellow escort carriers , , and . She rendezvoused with the fast carriers on 12 July, 16 July, and 20 July. After exhausting her replacement aircraft, she stopped at Guam on 21 July to replenish. She departed on 27 July, with a full load of 61 aircraft, and conducted rendezvous again with the fast carriers on 14 August. Shortly afterwards, while she was at sea, the Japanese surrender was announced. She then joined the main contingent of the Third Fleet, in support of the Occupation of Japan.

Following the end of the war, &quot;Roi&quot; joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She conducted several Magic Carpet runs throughout 1945 until she was released from the fleet. She then reported to Bremerton, Washington, where she was deactivated and decommissioned on 9 May 1946. She was struck from the Navy list on 21 May, and sold on 31 December to Zidell Machinery &amp; Supply of Portland, Oregon for scrapping. &quot;Roi&quot; was awarded one battle star for her World War II service.

<doc id="510896" wikidata="Q7867802" url="?curid=510896" title="USS Bougainville (CVE-100)">
<text>USS &quot;Bougainville&quot; (CVE-100) was the forty-sixth of fifty built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after the Bougainville campaign, a prolonged action against Japanese forces entrenched in the island of Bougainville off Papua New Guinea . The ship was launched in May 1944, and commissioned in June, and served as a replenishment carrier in support of the invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. She was decommissioned in November 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in August 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Bougainville&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, with a length at the waterline, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. The carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Because &quot;Bougainville&quot; only operated in a replenishment capability, she usually operated with about 60 aircraft on board, the maximum carrying capacity at which take-offs would still be possible.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Didrickson Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed &quot;Bougainville&quot;, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. The escort carrier was laid down on 3 March 1944, MC hull 1137, the forty-sixth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was launched on 16 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Sally A. Monfort; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 18 June 1944, with Captain Charles Alonzo Bond in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Bougainville&quot; got underway, on 7 July, on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. Upon arriving, she was assigned to the Carrier Transport Squadron of the Pacific Fleet. The carrier departed on 25 July with a load of aircraft, bound for the West Pacific. Transiting via Pearl Harbor, she headed to Majuro, in the Marshall Islands. She returned to the West Coast on 23 August, and following a seventeen-day period at port, she left on 9 September for another transport mission. She steamed to Finschhafen, New Guinea, before proceeding to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands, where she unloaded her aircraft. There, she took on an air group returning to Pearl Harbor, arriving at Oahu in mid-October.

After unloading her cargo, she took on a complement of sixty-four fighter aircraft, all bound for the Mariana Islands. After arriving at Saipan, her crew went to general quarters for the first time on 3 November in response to Japanese aircraft. Departing on 4 November, she headed to Guam, before returning to Pearl Harbor. In the closing months of 1944, &quot;Bougainville&quot; made another transport mission from Pearl Harbor to the Marianas, making a stop at Eniwetok. Upon completing her mission, she departed in mid-December for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 22 December. There, she underwent another stay of availability, until 7 January 1945, when she headed back into the Pacific.

She stopped at Pearl Harbor on 13 January, where she commenced flight training and gunnery exercises. Upon the completion of these activities, she departed Hawaiian waters on 30 January, arriving back at Eniwetok a week later. There, on 8 February, she was assigned to become a replenishment carrier as a part of Task Group 50.8.4, the mobile replenishment group supporting the frontline Fifth Fleet. She served alongside three other escort carriers, , , and . Replenishment escort carriers such as &quot;Bougainville&quot; enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time. She departed Eniwetok to commence her replenishment duties on 9 February.

For the next four months, &quot;Bougainville&quot; operated in a replenishment capability, supplying the Third Fleet&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force with supplies, replacement aircraft, and munitions. She first supported Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s carriers as they conducted operations in support of the landings on Iwo Jima. Upon the conclusion of said campaign, she provided aircraft to replace losses sustained in raids against the Japanese mainland, and she also provided support throughout the first six weeks of the Battle of Okinawa. During the Okinawa campaign, she had the task of providing replacement aircraft for both the escort carriers and the fleet carriers. Throughout her service as a replenishment carrier, she received supplies and additional aircraft from bases located within Eniwetok, Guam, and Ulithi in the Caroline Islands.
On 5 June, &quot;Bougainville&quot;, along with the ships of Task Group 38.1 and Task Group 30.8, was trapped in the path of Typhoon Connie, which was proceeding northwards, and on a course to the east of Okinawa. Admiral William Halsey Jr., which had already led the Third Fleet into the deadly Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, now managed to lead the Third Fleet yet again into another deadly storm. At the peak of the storm, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; experienced estimated winds of and waves towering some high. As Task Group 50.8 emerged from the typhoon, &quot;Bougainville&quot; had suffered considerable damage, in both her hull, and her aircraft contingent. Twenty-seven planes on &quot;Bougainville&quot; had been lost or wrecked, and most of her remaining planes, located in her hangar deck, were inaccessible, because both of her aircraft elevators had been jammed. In addition, her flight deck supports had been damaged, and she suffered much additional superficial damage.

In mid-June, &quot;Bougainville&quot; was released from her replenishment duties, when she undertook a transport mission to bases located within the Philippines, before returning to Guam. After completing her mission, she steamed eastward, pausing at Pearl Harbor, before arriving back at San Diego, where she lay in port until early August for repairs and replenishment. On 9 August, she left San Diego, bound yet again for the West Pacific. En route, her crew received news of the Japanese surrender on 15 August. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, she was anchored off of the island of Roi-Namur when the formal signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was occurring on 2 September. There, she loaded inoperational aircraft, before heading back to Oahu. At Pearl Harbor, she took on a load of aircraft and passengers, departing port on 12 September, stopping at Apra Harbor, Guam, where she disembarked some passengers and took on additional aircraft. Continuing westwards, she anchored at Nakagusuku Bay on 27 September, before leaving harbor the following day to evade Typhoon Jean, which appeared to heading for the Okinawa Islands.

&quot;Bougainville&quot; returned to port on 3 October, where she took on two Marine Corps observation squadrons, VMO-3 and VMO-6, which were headed to China for occupation duty. On 10 October, she arrived at the Taku Forts, where she disembarked VMO-3, which was attached to the 3rd Marines. Proceeding southwards, she arrived at Qingdao on 11 October, and on 12 October, VMO-6, which was attached to the 6th Marines, disembarked. After a layover of four days at Qingdao, she steamed for Okinawa on 16 October. She entered Nakagusuku Bay on 19 October, where she took on a load of inoperational aircraft and passengers. Steaming eastwards, she made a brief layover at Pearl Harbor, arriving back at the West Coast by the end of October.

After a long stay in port, &quot;Bougainville&quot; once again departed on 28 November, heading to Eniwetok, via Pearl Harbor. She returned to San Diego on 12 January 1946, whereupon she steamed northwards, arriving at Tacoma, Washington in late-January. There, inactivation work was conducted, and she was placed in reserve on 29 July. She was decommissioned on 30 November, and mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, as part of its Tacoma Group. Whilst in reserve, she was reclassified as a utility aircraft carrier (CVU-100) on 12 June 1955. She was further reclassified as an aircraft ferry (AKV-35) on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and she was sold on 9 September to the Cole Export Corp. Delivered on 7 November, she was ultimately broken up in Japan later that year. &quot;Bougainville&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>The &quot;Qahir&quot; class is a class of two corvettes designed and built by VT Group in the United Kingdom for the Royal Navy of Oman. The hull and superstructure has been designed with features including the cladding of surfaces with radar absorbent material and angled sides to reduce the radar cross section.

==Ships in Class==
Oman placed an order for two corvettes from Vosper Thornycroft as part of Project &quot;Muheet&quot; on 5 April 1992, work beginning in September 1992. The two ships were completed in 1996, with the final ship, &quot;Al Mua&#x27;zzar&quot; being delivered to Oman and commissioned in 1997.

<text>Amphictyon or Amphiktyon (; ), in Greek mythology, was a king of Thermopylae and later Athens. In one account, he was the ruler of Locris.

== Etymology ==
The name of Amphictyon is a back-formation from &quot;Amphictyons&quot;, plural, from Latin &quot;Amphictyones&quot;, from Greek &quot;Amphiktyones, Amphiktiones&quot;, literally, &quot;neighbors&quot; or &quot;those dwelling around&quot; from &quot;amphi- + -ktyones, -ktiones&quot; (from &quot;ktizein&quot; to found); akin to Sanskrit &quot;kṣeti&quot; he dwells, &quot;kṣiti&quot; abode, Avestan &quot;shitish&quot; dwelling, Armenian &quot;šen&quot; inhabited, cultivated.

== Family ==
Amphictyon was the second son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, although there was also a tradition that he was autochthonous (born from the earth); he was also said to be a son of Hellen, his brother in the first account. Amphictyon&#x27;s other (possible) siblings besides Hellen were Protogeneia, Thyia, Pandora II, Melantho (Melanthea) and Candybus.

Amphictyon married a daughter of King Cranaus of Athens.

Amphictyon had a son, Itonus, who in his turn became the father of Boeotus, Iodame and Chromia by Melanippe. He also had a daughter, never mentioned by name, who became the mother of Cercyon by Poseidon, and of Triptolemus by Rarus. Some added that Amphictyon had another son, Physcus, by Chthonopatra, daughter of his brother Hellen. However, others stated that Physcus was the grandson of Amphictyon through Aetolus. In this late account, the kingdom of Locris was ruled from Amphictyon to Aetolus, then Physcus and eventually, Locrus who gave his name to the land.

== Mythology ==
One account related that during the reign of King Cranaus, Deucalion, who founded and ruled over Lycoreia in Mt. Parnassus, was said to have fled from his kingdom during the great flood with his sons Hellen and Amphictyon, and seek refuge to Athens. Later on, the latter became king of Thermopylae and brought together those living round about the temple and named them Amphictyons, and sacrificed on their behalf. While ruling in his new kingdom, Amphictyon&#x27;s brother Hellen emigrated to Phthiotis where he became the ruler.

Eventually, Amphictyon deposed Cranaus and proclaimed himself king of Athens. Amphictyon ruled the kingdom for 10, or in some accounts, 12 years and founded the Amphictyonic League which traditionally met at Thermopylae in historical times. During his rule, Dionysus was supposed to have visited him in Athens and taught him how to mix water with wine in the proper proportions. Amphictyon was later on dethroned by Erichthonius, another autochthonous king of Athens.

<doc id="510905" wikidata="Q619798" url="?curid=510905" title="Geomatics">
<text>Geomatics is defined in the ISO/TC 211 series of standards as the &quot;discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information&quot;. Under another definition, it consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic (geospatial) data. Surveying engineering was the widely used name for geomatic(s) engineering in the past. Geomatics was placed by the UNESCO Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems under the branch of technical geography.

==History and etymology ==

The term was proposed in French (&quot;géomatique&quot;) at the end of the 1960s by scientist Bernard Dubuisson to reflect at the time recent changes in the jobs of surveyor and photogrammetrist. The term was first employed in a French Ministry of Public Works memorandum dated 1 June 1971 instituting a &quot;standing committee of geomatics&quot; in the government.

The term was popularised in English by French-Canadian surveyor Michel Paradis in his &quot;The little Geodesist that could&quot; article, in 1981 and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the Canadian Institute of Surveying (now known as the Canadian Institute of Geomatics) in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and that, in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.

Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), global navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in Canada but has since been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference for the term &quot;geospatial technology&quot;, which may be defined as synonym of &quot;geospatial information and communications technology&quot;.

Although many definitions of &quot;geomatics&quot;, such as the above, appear to encompass the entire discipline relating to geographic information – including geodesy, geographic information systems, remote sensing, satellite navigation, and cartography –, the term is almost exclusively restricted to the perspective of surveying and engineering toward geographic information. &quot;Geoinformatics&quot; and &quot;Geographic information science has been proposed as alternative comprehensive term; however, their popularity is, like geomatics, largely dependent on country.

The related field of &quot;hydrogeomatics&quot; covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of hydrographics was considered too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments. The use of different data processing technologies in hydrography does not change the purpose of its research.

&quot;Health geomatics&quot; can improve our understanding of the important relationship between location and health, and thus assist us in Public Health tasks like disease prevention, and also in better healthcare service planning. An important area of research is the use of open data in planning lifesaving activities. 

&quot;Mining geomatics&quot; is the use of information systems to integrate and process spatial data for monitoring, modelling, visualisation and design of mining operations. 

A growing number of university departments which were once titled &quot;surveying&quot;, &quot;survey engineering&quot; or &quot;topographic science&quot; have re-titled themselves using the terms &quot;geomatics&quot; or &quot;geomatics engineering&quot;, while others have switched to program titles such as &quot;spatial information technology&quot;, and similar names.

The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in computer hardware, computer science, and software engineering, as well as by airborne and space observation remote-sensing technologies.

== Geomatics engineering ==
Geomatics engineering is a rapidly developing engineering discipline which focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.

Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.

<doc id="510906" wikidata="Q7871597" url="?curid=510906" title="USS Matanikau">
<text>USS &quot;Matanikau&quot; (CVE-101) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Actions along the Matanikau, a series of engagements during the Guadalcanal campaign. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in May 1944, and commissioned in June, and served as a training and transport carrier. Notably, some 1,332 aviators earned their qualifications on-board the carrier. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in October 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in July 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Matanikau&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy war losses in the early engagements of the Pacific War. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Dolomi Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The escort carrier was laid down on 10 March 1944, MC hull 1138, the forty-seventh of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-101. On 26 April 1944, she was renamed &quot;Matanikau&quot;, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. She was named after the Actions along the Matanikau, a series of engagements conducted as part of the larger Guadalcanal campaign. She was launched on 22 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Anna McLaren Grant, the wife of United States Representative Robert A. Grant; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 24 June 1944, with Captain William Lawrence Erdmann in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Matanikau&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego, arriving on 25 July. She then underwent a transport mission, taking on 191 passengers and 56 aircraft. She departed on 1 August, bound for the South Pacific. She stopped at Espiritu Santo and Finschhafen, before arriving at Manus Island on 23 August. There, she discharged the rest of her cargo, and took on a load of 112 passengers and 41 damaged aircraft, ferrying them back to the West Coast. She arrived back at San Diego on 19 September. This transport mission would be the farthest west that she would ever sail during the course of the war. On 14 August, she took on Composite Squadron 93 (VC-93), and began pilot qualifications, serving as a training carrier off the California coast. She continued these duties for eight months, qualifying an impressive amount of aviators. Between January and June 1945, 1,332 pilots earned their qualifications onboard &quot;Matanikau&quot;, and 12,762 landings were conducted on her flight deck during this period. For example, on 25 May 1945, Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadrons 454 and 321 (CVS-454 and CVS-321) made 602 landings throughout the day. During her period as a training carrier, Captain Francis Benedict Johnson took over command of the vessel, a position that he would hold for the rest of the war.

She finished her duties as a training carrier, and departed San Diego on 28 July, yet again as a transport carrier, with 158 personnel and 68 aircraft being transported to the Marshall Islands. She arrived at Roi-Namur on 10 August, where she unloaded her cargo. She then reported to Pearl Harbor on 16 August. Whilst in Hawaii, news of the Japanese surrender broke. On 31 August, she departed Pearl Harbor, bound for the West Pacific, where she would support U.S. forces in their Occupation of Japan. She was assigned to the Ninth Fleet, and arrived at Ōminato Guard District on 11 September. She operated off the west coast of Japan, covering landings by U.S. forces, including the Eighth Army at Aomori on 25 September. Following the landings, she steamed south, and departed Tokyo Bay on 30 September, making stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor, before arriving back at San Francisco on 23 October.

At San Francisco, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She left the West Coast on 3 November, and steamed for Saipan, where she embarked more than a thousand personnel. She returned to California on 19 November, before making another run to the Marshalls between 21 November and 5 December. On 11 December, she once again departed, this time for the Marianas Islands, and as part of an operation independent of Operation Magic Carpet. She arrived at Guam on 27 December, where she took on a load of 795 troops of the 3rd Marine Division, and dropped them off at the Taku Forts, near Tianjin. There, the marines served in an advisory role, supporting the Kuomintang Republic of China in the Chinese Civil War.

She left for the United States on 9 January 1946, and returned to port in San Diego on 29 January. She departed for Tacoma, Washington on 1 February, arriving on the 5th for inactivation. There, she was moored for the next eight months, before being decommissioned on 11 October. She was mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, and she was reclassified as an escort helicopter aircraft carrier, CVHE-101 on 15 June 1955. She was reclassified as an aircraft ferry with the designation of AKV-36 on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960 and she was sold on 27 July 1960 to Jacq. Pierot, Jr. &amp; Sons, New York for scrapping.

<doc id="510910" wikidata="Q2302345" url="?curid=510910" title="The Saturday Evening Post">
<text>The Saturday Evening Post is an American magazine, currently published six times a year. It was published weekly from 1897 until 1963, and then every other week until 1969. From the 1920s to the 1960s, it was one of the most widely circulated and influential magazines among the American middle class, with fiction, non-fiction, cartoons and features that reached two million homes every week.

In the 1960s, the magazine&#x27;s readership began to decline. In 1969, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; folded for two years before being revived as a quarterly publication with an emphasis on medical articles in 1971.

As of the late 2000s, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; is published six times a year by the Saturday Evening Post Society, which purchased the magazine in 1982. The magazine was redesigned in 2013.

==History==
===19th century===

&quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; was first published in 1821 in the same printing shop at 53 Market Street in Philadelphia, where the Benjamin Franklin-founded &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; was published in the 18th century. While the &quot;Gazette&quot; ceased publication in 1800, ten years after Franklin&#x27;s death, the &quot;Post&quot; links its history to the original magazine.

Cyrus H. K. Curtis, publisher of the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, bought the &quot;Post&quot; for $1,000 in 1897. Under the ownership of the Curtis Publishing Company, the &quot;Post&quot; grew to become the most widely circulated weekly magazine in the United States. The magazine gained prominent status under the leadership of its longtime editor George Horace Lorimer (1899–1937).

&quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; published current event articles, editorials, human interest pieces, humor, illustrations, a letter column, poetry with contributions submitted by readers, single-panel gag cartoons, including &quot;Hazel&quot; by Ted Key, and stories by leading writers of the time. It was known for commissioning lavish illustrations and original works of fiction. Illustrations were featured on the cover and embedded in stories and advertising. Some &quot;Post&quot; illustrations continue to be reproduced as posters or prints, especially those by Norman Rockwell.

===20th century===
In 1929, at the beginning of the Mexican Repatriation, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; ran a series on the racial inferiority of Mexicans. 

In 1954, it published its first articles on the role of the U.S. in deposing Mohammad Mosaddegh, Prime Minister of Iran, in 1953. The article was based on materials leaked by CIA director Allen Dulles.

The &quot;Post&quot; readership began to decline in the late 1950s and 1960s. In general, the decline of general interest magazines was blamed on television, which competed for advertisers and readers&#x27; attention. The &quot;Post&quot; had problems retaining readers: the public&#x27;s taste in fiction was changing, and the &quot;Post&quot;″s conservative politics and values appealed to a declining number of people. Content by popular writers became harder to obtain. Prominent authors drifted away to newer magazines offering more money and status. As a result, the &quot;Post&quot; published more articles on current events and cut costs by replacing illustrations with photographs for covers and advertisements.

In 1967, the magazine&#x27;s publisher, Curtis Publishing Company, lost a landmark defamation suit, &quot;Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts&quot;, 388 U.S. 130 (1967), resulting from an article, and was ordered to pay in damages to the plaintiff. The &quot;Post&quot; article implied that football coaches Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant and Wally Butts conspired to fix a game between the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia. Both coaches sued Curtis Publishing Co. for defamation, each initially asking for . Bryant eventually settled for while Butts&#x27; case went to the Supreme Court, which held that libel damages may be recoverable (in this instance against a news organization) when the injured party is a non-public official, if the plaintiff can prove that the defendant was guilty of a reckless lack of professional standards when examining allegations for reasonable credibility. (Butts was eventually awarded .)

William Emerson was promoted to editor-in-chief in 1965 and remained in the position until the magazine&#x27;s demise in 1969.

In 1968, Martin Ackerman, a specialist in troubled firms, became president of Curtis after lending it . With the magazine still in dire financial straits, Ackerman announced that Curtis would reduce printing costs by cancelling the subscriptions of roughly half of its readers. Those who lost their subscriptions were offered a free transfer to a subscription to &quot;Life&quot; magazine; &quot;Life&quot; publisher Time Inc. paid Curtis for the exchange, easing the company&#x27;s mounting debts. The move was also widely seen as an opportunity for Curtis to abandon older and more rural readers, who were less valuable to the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s advertisers. Columnist Art Buchwald lampooned the decision, suggesting that &quot;if the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; considered you a deadbeat, you didn&#x27;t have much choice but to either pretend you were still getting the magazine and live a lie, or move out of the neighborhood before anyone found out.&quot;

These last-ditch efforts failed to save the magazine, and Curtis announced in January 1969 that the February 8 issue would be the magazine&#x27;s last. Ackerman stated that the magazine had lost in 1968 and would lose a projected in 1969. In a meeting with employees after the magazine&#x27;s closure had been announced, Emerson thanked the staff for their professional work and promised &quot;to stay here and see that everyone finds a job&quot;.

At a March 1969 &quot;post-mortem&quot; on the magazine&#x27;s closing, Emerson stated that &quot;The Post&quot; &quot;was a damn good vehicle for advertising&quot; with competitive renewal rates and readership reports and expressed what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;understandable bitterness&quot; in wishing &quot;that all the one-eyed critics will lose their other eye&quot;. Otto Friedrich, the magazine&#x27;s last managing editor, blamed the death of &quot;The Post&quot; on Curtis. In his &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1970), an account of the magazine&#x27;s final years (1962–69), he argued that corporate management was unimaginative and incompetent. Friedrich acknowledges that &quot;The Post&quot; faced challenges while the tastes of American readers changed over the course of the 1960s, but he insisted that the magazine maintained a standard of good quality and was appreciated by readers.

In 1970, control of the debilitated Curtis Publishing Company was acquired from the estate of Cyrus Curtis by Indianapolis industrialist Beurt SerVaas. SerVaas relaunched the &quot;Post&quot; the following year on a quarterly basis as a kind of nostalgia magazine.

In early 1982, ownership of the &quot;Post&quot; was transferred to the Benjamin Franklin Literary and Medical Society, founded in 1976 by the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s then-editor, Corena &quot;Cory&quot; SerVaas (wife of Beurt SerVaas). The magazine&#x27;s core focus was now health and medicine; indeed, the magazine&#x27;s website originally noted that the &quot;credibility of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; has made it a valuable asset for reaching medical consumers and for helping medical researchers obtain family histories. In the magazine, national health surveys are taken to further current research on topics such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, ulcerative colitis, spina bifida, and bipolar disorder.&quot; Ownership of the magazine was later transferred to the Saturday Evening Post Society; SerVaas headed both organizations. The range of topics covered in the magazine&#x27;s articles is now wide, suitable for a general readership.

By 1991, Curtis Publishing Company had been renamed Curtis International, a subsidiary of SerVaas Inc., and had become an importer of audiovisual equipment. Today the &quot;Post&quot; is published six times a year by the Saturday Evening Post Society, which claims 501(c)(3) non-profit organization status.

===21st century===
With the January/February 2013 issue, the &quot;Post&quot; launched a major makeover of the publication, including a new cover design and efforts to increase the magazine&#x27;s profile, in response to a general public misbelief that it was no longer in existence. The magazine&#x27;s new logo is an update of a logo it had used beginning in 1942. As of October 2018, the complete archive of the magazine is available online.

==Legacy==
===Illustrations===

In 1916, &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; editor George Horace Lorimer discovered Norman Rockwell, then an unknown 22-year-old New York City artist. Lorimer promptly purchased two illustrations from Rockwell, using them as covers, and commissioned three more drawings. Rockwell&#x27;s illustrations of the American family and rural life of a bygone era became icons. During his 50-year career with the &quot;Post&quot;, Rockwell painted more than 300 covers.

The &quot;Post&quot; also employed Nebraska artist John Philip Falter, who became known as &quot;a painter of Americana with an accent of the Middle West,&quot; who &quot;brought out some of the homeliness and humor of Middle Western town life and home life.&quot; He produced 120 covers for the &quot;Post&quot; between 1943 and 1968, ceasing only when the magazine began displaying photographs on its covers. 

Another prominent artist was Charles R. Chickering, a freelance illustrator who went on to design numerous postage stamps for the U.S. Post Office. Other popular cover illustrators include artists George Hughes, Constantin Alajalov,
John Clymer, Alonzo Kimball, W. H. D. Koerner, J. C. Leyendecker, Mead Schaeffer, Charles Archibald MacLellan, John E. Sheridan, Emmett Watson, Douglass Crockwell, and N. C. Wyeth.

Cartoonists have included: Irwin Caplan, Clyde Lamb, Jerry Marcus, Frank O&#x27;Neal, Charles M. Schulz, and Bill Yates. The magazine ran Ted Key&#x27;s cartoon panel series &quot;Hazel&quot; from 1943 to 1969.

===Literature===
Each issue featured several original short stories and often included an installment of a serial appearing in successive issues. Most of the fiction was written for mainstream tastes by popular writers, but some literary writers were featured. The opening pages of stories featured paintings by the leading magazine illustrators.

The &quot;Post&quot; published stories and essays by H. E. Bates, Ray Bradbury, Kay Boyle, Agatha Christie, Brian Cleeve, Eleanor Franklin Egan, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, C. S. Forester, Ernest Haycox, Robert A. Heinlein, Kurt Vonnegut, Paul Gallico, Normand Poirier, Hammond Innes, Louis L&#x27;Amour, Sinclair Lewis, Joseph C. Lincoln, John P. Marquand, Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Sax Rohmer, William Saroyan, John Steinbeck, Rex Stout, Rob Wagner, Edith Wharton, and P.G. Wodehouse.

Poetry published came from poets including: Carl Sandburg, Ogden Nash, Dorothy Parker, and Hannah Kahn.

Jack London&#x27;s best-known novel &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; was first published, in serialized form, in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1903.

Emblematic of the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; fiction was author Clarence Budington Kelland, who first appeared in 1916–17 with stories of homespun heroes, &quot;Efficiency Edgar&quot; and &quot;Scattergood Baines&quot;. Kelland was a steady presence from 1922 until 1961.

For many years William Hazlett Upson contributed a very popular series of short stories about the escapades of Earthworm Tractors salesman Alexander Botts.

Publication in the &quot;Post&quot; launched careers and helped established artists and writers stay afloat. P. G. Wodehouse said &quot;the wolf was always at the door&quot; until the &quot;Post&quot; gave him his &quot;first break&quot; in 1915 by serializing &quot;Something New&quot;.

==Politics==
After the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, &quot;Post&quot; columnist Garet Garrett became a vocal critic of the New Deal. Garrett accused the Roosevelt administration of initiating socialist strategies.

After Lorimer died, Garrett became editorial writer-in-chief and criticized the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s support of the United Kingdom and efforts to prepare to enter World War II, and allegedly showed some support for Adolf Hitler in some of his editorials. Garrett&#x27;s positions aroused controversy and may have cost the &quot;Post&quot; readers and advertisers in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor.

<text>USS &quot;Palau&quot; was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

She was laid down by the Todd-Pacific Shipyards Inc., Tacoma, Washington, 19 February 1945; launched 6 August 1945; sponsored by Mrs. J. P. Whitney; and commissioned 15 January 1946.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Palau&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. &quot;Palau&quot; was laid down at the Todd Pacific Shipyards facility in Tacoma, Washington, on 19 February 1945. She was launched on 6 August and commissioned on 15 January 1946. By that time, World War II had ended, and so &quot;Palau&quot; completed her initial shakedown cruise off California, passed through the Panama Canal, steamed to Boston, and then on 11 May, sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was laid up in reserve.

The ship was reactivated in May 1947, departing on 22 May for Cuba for training exercises in the area. She then returned to Norfolk and then New York, where her crew made preparations for a lengthy voyage abroad. She sailed south for Recife, Brazil, and then turned east to West Africa. She arrived back in the United States on 16 August, stopping first in Boston for repairs, and then proceeding back to Norfolk to return to the reserve fleet in December. 

She was reactivated again in March 1948 for training exercises off the East Coast of the United States. These included parts of the Packard series of combined amphibious and helicopter assault experiments with the recently created Marine helicopter squadron HMX-1. &quot;Palau&quot; first participated in Packard II, which involved five Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw helicopters taking part in the so-called &quot;vertical assault&quot; concept. Packard III followed in May, in which eight helicopters operated from &quot;Palau&quot;, simulating a full-scale attack by 184 helicopters. Over the course of Packard III, the helicopters carried passengers and equipment some ten miles inland to demonstrate the concept of using helicopter-borne troops to seize strategic areas behind the lines while landing craft went ashore. Following the maneuvers, she left for a cruise in the Mediterranean Sea, the purpose of which was to deliver aircraft to Turkey. She transferred the aircraft at Yeşilköy, Turkey, and then returned to Norfolk on 7 August. She spent the next four years cruising off the East Coast, from as far north as Canada and as far south as the West Indies.

In April 1952, &quot;Palau&quot; got underway from Norfolk for another voyage into the Mediterranean, this time as part of 6th Fleet. She operated in the region until late June, when she transferred back to the East Coast as part of 2nd Fleet. The ship was scheduled to be laid up again in early 1953, but the Navy decided to keep her in active service for a final voyage overseas. She embarked another group of aircraft to be transferred to an allied country, this time to Yokosuka, Japan. The voyage lasted from 8 August to 22 October, at which point she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was decommissioned for the last time on 15 June 1954. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. &quot;Palau&quot; was allocated to the Philadelphia Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained for the next six years. She was struck from the naval register on 1 April 1960 and sold on 13 July to ship breakers in New York.

Some parts were salvaged from the scrapyard in Sestao, and installed in Picos de Europa as a mountaineers&#x27; hut.

<text>USS &quot;Tinian&quot; was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

Ordered and constructed during World War II, &quot;Tinian&quot; never entered active service and was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Tacoma after being completed. In June 1955, the ship was reclassified a helicopter carrier and in May 1959, a cargo ship and aircraft ferry. The ship remained in reserve for her entire career and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1970 and sold for scrap.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Tinian&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==

The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. &quot;Tinian&quot;, named for the eponymous island captured by US forces in July 1944, was built by the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington. Her keel was laid down on 20 March 1945 and her completed hull was launched on 5 September, after the end of World War II. She was completed in mid-1946 and was accepted by the US Navy on 30 July. The ship was not commissioned, and was instead assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, based in Tacoma. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so the rest of the class remained laid up, and they were soon replaced in the ASW role by much larger s. 

She was reclassified as an escort helicopter carrier on 12 June 1955, with the hull number CVHE-123. In early June 1958 &quot;Tinian&quot; was taken in tow at Tacoma, Washington, by the US Navy MSTS tugboat USNS &quot;Yuma&quot;, destined for San Diego, California. While very near the Swiftsure Bank lightship, Neah Bay, Washington; at the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, &quot;Yuma&quot; developed engine troubles. &quot;Yuma&quot;″s distress call brought to her rescue. The crew of the &quot;Swiftsure lightship&quot; went to general quarters, ready to assist. &quot;Fir&quot; then escorted &quot;Yuma&quot; and &quot;Tinian&quot; to safety. &quot;Tinian&quot; arrived at the South Tee Pier in San Diego on 9 June.

The ship was reclassified again in May 1959, now as a cargo ship and aircraft ferry with the hull number AKV-23. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory, part of the San Diego Group of the Reserve Fleet, until she was struck from the naval register on 1 June 1970. She was eventually sold for scrap to the Levin Metals Company of San Jose, California on 15 December 1971.

<text>USS &quot;Mindoro&quot; (hull number: CVE-120) was a of the United States Navy. The ship was a converted oil tanker, and she had a capacity to carry up to thirty-three aircraft. She was built during World War II, but was completed too late to see action during the conflict. She nevertheless saw service with the 8th Fleet in the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Atlantic Ocean. She also made two deployments to the Mediterranean Sea, in 1950 and 1954, before being decommissioned in January 1955 and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was retained for just four years before being struck from the naval register in December 1959 and thereafter scrapped.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Mindoro&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The keel for &quot;Mindoro&quot; was laid down at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc., in Tacoma, Washington, on 2 January 1945. The completed hull was launched on 27 June 1945. She was commissioned at Tacoma on 4 December 1945, too late to have seen action during the war. The ship was named for the Battle of Mindoro in December 1944. Following her completion, she embarked on a shakedown cruise to test the ship along the West Coast of the United States, that lasted into January 1946; later that month, she departed for the East Coast of the United States, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, on 15 February. Despite the fact that the United States was demobilizing much of the armed forces that had been assembled during the war, the newly completed &quot;Mindoro&quot; would be kept in active service.

&quot;Mindoro&quot; was assigned to Carrier Division 14, which she soon joined for training exercises to practice carrier operations. In May, she sailed to the West Indies, where she took part in large scale maneuvers with ships from 8th Fleet. She spent the rest of the year cruising along the East Coast and as far south as Cuba; during this period, she conducted routine training exercises for her pilots and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises. In the postwar period, the Navy adopted a combined-arms approach to ASW defense for the fleet and the US coast; escort carriers like &quot;Mindoro&quot; formed hunter-killer groups, which were supported by patrol craft and blimps like the K class. The blimps frequently practiced joint operations with the escort carriers, including landing on the flight deck. She spent the next nine years operating on a similar routine of training exercises and fleet maneuvers, and she was based at Norfolk for this period. In November 1947, she took part in the Civilian Cruise Program, a public relations program the Navy had begun after the end of the war in 1945. George Whelan Anderson Jr. captained &quot;Mindoro&quot; beginning in July 1948.

She also made trips across the Atlantic to visit Britain, and in 1950, she was sent on a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea for assignment with the 6th Fleet. During the deployment, &quot;Mindoro&quot; served as part of the ASW screen for the fleet. She also brought her escorting cruisers and destroyers, which further strengthened the fleet. The deployment was in response to the outbreak of the Korean War earlier in 1950; many warships from the 6th Fleet had been transferred to the Pacific to support operations in Korea, so &quot;Mindoro&quot;″s ASW group was sent to reinforce the 6th Fleet. From 1951 to 1952, David L. McDonald served as the ship&#x27;s commander. In September 1952, &quot;Mindoro&quot; took part in the major NATO naval exercise, Exercise Mainbrace, off Norway and Denmark. In 1954, she made a second deployment to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet.

The ship took part in her final training maneuvers off the Virginia Capes in January 1955, after which she sailed to Boston on the 17th. She was decommissioned there on 4 August and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. &quot;Mindoro&quot;″s hull number was changed to AKV-20 on 7 May 1959, and later that year the navy decided to discard the ship. She was struck from the naval register on 1 December 1959, sold in June 1960, and then towed to Hong Kong later that year, where she was broken up for scrap.

<doc id="510924" wikidata="Q1321046" url="?curid=510924" title="Rhodes College">
<text>Rhodes College is a private liberal arts college in Memphis, Tennessee. Historically affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), it is a member of the Associated Colleges of the South and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Rhodes enrolls about 2,000 students, and its Collegiate Gothic campus sits on a 123-acre wooded site in Memphis&#x27; historic Midtown neighborhood.

==History==
The early origins of Rhodes can be traced to the mid-1830s and the establishment of the all-male Montgomery Academy on the outskirts of Clarksville, Tennessee. The city&#x27;s flourishing tobacco market and profitable river port made Clarksville one of the fastest-growing cities in the then-western United States and quickly led to calls to turn the modest &quot;log college&quot; into a proper university. In 1848, the Tennessee General Assembly authorized the conveyance of the academy&#x27;s property for the establishment of the Masonic University of Tennessee.

In 1855, control of the university passed to the Presbyterian Church, and it was renamed Stewart College in honor of its president and benefactor, William M. Stewart. The college&#x27;s early growth halted during the American Civil War, during which its buildings served as a headquarters for the Union Army throughout the federal occupation of Clarksville. The war was especially costly for the young institution, as the campus suffered extensive damage and looting.

The sad condition of campus and the slow recovery of the Southern economy made getting the college back on its feet a slow and difficult process. However, renewed support from the Presbyterian Church gave the college new life. In 1875 the college was renamed Southwestern Presbyterian University after it added an undergraduate School of Theology under the leadership of Joseph Ruggles Wilson, father of President Woodrow Wilson; it closed in 1917.

By the early 20th century, the college had still not fully recovered from the Civil War and faced dwindling financial support and inconsistent enrollment. Hoping to reverse the institution&#x27;s fortunes, the board of directors hired Charles E. Diehl, the pastor of Clarksville&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church, to take over as president.

In order to revive the college, Diehl implemented a number of reforms: the admission of women in 1917, an honor code for students in 1918, and the recruitment of Oxford-trained scholars to lead the implementation of an Oxford-Cambridge style of education. Diehl&#x27;s application of an Oxbridge-style tutorial system, in which students study subjects in individual sessions with their professors, allowed the college to join Harvard as the only two colleges in the United States then employing such a system. During Diehl&#x27;s tenure as president, he would add more than a dozen Oxford-educated scholars to the faculty, and their style of teaching would form the foundation of the modern Rhodes curriculum. 

Diehl&#x27;s most significant change to the college came in 1925, when he orchestrated the movement of the campus from Clarksville to its present location in Memphis, Tennessee (the Clarksville campus now forms part of the grounds of Austin Peay State University). The move provided an increase in financial contributions and student enrollment, and, despite the Great Depression and World War II, the college began to grow. In 1945, the college adopted its penultimate name Southwestern at Memphis in order to distinguish itself from other colleges and universities containing the name &quot;Southwestern.&quot;

Diehl retired in 1948, and the board of trustees unanimously chose physics professor Peyton N. Rhodes as his successor. During Rhodes&#x27; sixteen-year presidency the college admitted its first Black students; added ten new buildings, including Burrow Library, Mallory Gymnasium, and the emblematic Halliburton Tower; increased enrollment from 600 to 900; founded a campus chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society; and grew the endowment to over $14 million. In 1984, the board of trustees decided the name &quot;Southwestern&quot; needed to be retired, and the college&#x27;s name was changed to Rhodes College to honor the man who had served the institution for more than fifty years.

Rhodes has grown into a nationally ranked liberal arts and sciences college. Under the leadership of James H. Daughdrill, Jr. (president from 1973 to 1999) and William E. Troutt (president from 1999 to 2017), the college&#x27;s physical expansion continued, and Rhodes now offers more than 50 majors, interdisciplinary majors, minors, and academic programs. Additionally, the school has built partnerships with numerous Memphis institutions to provide students with a network of research, service, and internships opportunities. 

In July 2017, Marjorie Hass began her tenure as the 20th president of Rhodes College, as the college&#x27;s first female president. She departed Rhodes in June 2021 after being named the president of the Council of Independent Colleges and was succeeded by Jennifer Collins.

==Academics and reputation==

The academic environment at Rhodes centers around small classes, faculty mentorship, and an emphasis on student research and writing. The average class size is 14, and the college has a 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio. In 2017, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked Rhodes #9 for Most Accessible Professors. Rhodes is featured perennially on the &quot;US News&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot; lists of the Top 55 Liberal Arts Universities and has been hailed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of the Top 20 Colleges in the South. In US News 2020 edition, Rhodes is ranked No. 53 on its National Liberal Arts College Ranking and 28th college in the south on Forbes 2019 edition.

Through 18 academic departments and 13 interdisciplinary programs, Rhodes offers more than 50 majors, interdisciplinary majors, minors, and academic programs. If students are unable to find a major that meets their specific interests, the college may allow them to design their own major that is better tailored to their goals. Although the college is primarily focused on undergraduate education, Rhodes also offers graduate degrees in Accounting and Urban Education. 

Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Business Administration &amp; Management (63)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (46)
*Neuroscience (36)
*English Language and Literature (29)
*Chemistry (27)
*Psychology (27)
*Computer Science (24)
*International Relations &amp; Affairs (22)

At the core of the Rhodes academic experience is the Foundations Curriculum, which gives students freedom to follow their academic interests and aspirations while developing the critical-thinking and communication skills that are fundamental to a liberal arts education. It also requires students to connect their classroom experience to the real world through an internship, research, and/or study abroad opportunities. More than 400 different courses are offered to fulfill the Foundations course requirements.

=== Graduate school placement &amp; postgraduate scholarships ===
About one-third of Rhodes students go on to graduate or professional school. Rhodes is in the top 10% of all U.S. colleges for the percentage of students who earn Ph.D.s in the sciences and among the top five in the Southeast. Rhodes is also a top 10 undergraduate source of psychology Ph.D.s. The acceptance rates of Rhodes alumni to law and business schools are around 95%, and the acceptance rate to medical schools is nearly twice the national average. Additionally, Rhodes&#x27; partnership with the George Washington University School of Medicine allows Rhodes students that meet certain criteria by their sophomore year to receive a guarantee of later acceptance to the George Washington University School of Medicine.

Rhodes has produced eight Rhodes Scholars, is named perennially as a &quot;Top Producing Institution&quot; for Fulbright Scholars, and boasts numerous Truman Scholars, Goldwater Scholars, Henry Luce Scholars, National Science Foundation Graduate Fellows, and recipients of the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship.

=== Community service ===

More than 80 percent of Rhodes students are involved in some form of community service, and the college has the oldest collegiate chapter of Habitat for Humanity and the longest student-run soup kitchen in the country. Rhodes&#x27; Kinney Program provides students with a direct connection to service and social-action opportunities in Memphis by cultivating relationships with about 100 local partners. Additionally, the Bonner Scholars Program offers scholarships to up to 15 students per class who have a strong commitment to change-based service. Rhodes also offers Summer Service Fellowships that award academic credit to students working full-time with Memphis community organizations and non-profits.

The mission statement of the college reinforces community engagement, aspiring to &quot;graduate students with ... a compassion for others and the ability to translate academic study and personal concern into effective leadership and action in their communities and the world&quot;.

=== Internships and research ===

In 2017, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked Rhodes #16 for Best Schools for Internships and #16 for Best Career Services. Students are encouraged to take advantage of Rhodes&#x27; metropolitan backdrop to participate in off-campus internships and &quot;service learning&quot;. They are also given the opportunity to participate in a variety of research programs, such as the Summer Plus program at St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, the Rhodes/UT Neuroscience Fellowship, the Center for Outreach and Development of the Arts, the Mike Curb Institute for Music, the Shelby Foote Fellowship, and the Mayor&#x27;s Urban Fellows Program. 

Rhodes also helps students obtain internships across the country and overseas. As a part of one of the oldest and largest international relations undergraduate programs in the United States, Rhodes&#x27; Mertie W. Buckman International Internship Program provides funding for outstanding students majoring in International Studies to work abroad during the summer months. In addition to the work experience, Buckman interns are provided with a stipend to use for cultural enrichment while abroad. Past students have worked for the U.S. Department of Commerce in France and Croatia, the German Marshall Fund in Belgium and Poland, taught English through nonprofit organizations in Cambodia, and helped a U.S. firm set up operations in China. Additionally, the Political Science Department offers semester programs in Washington, D.C.

=== Study abroad ===

The Institute of International Education&#x27;s &quot;Open Doors Report&quot;, listed Rhodes as one of Top 35 Colleges in the United States for Students Who Study Abroad. Rhodes offers a number of its own study abroad programs, including European Studies, a fall semester program in which students travel to various locations in Europe while studying at the University of Oxford. Additionally, students can explore a variety of summer programs in locations such as Belgium, London, and Ecuador.

In order to lower the financial obstacles to studying abroad, Rhodes allows students to use their federal and institutional aid on any one of more than 300 Rhodes-affiliated semester-long study abroad programs. The college&#x27;s Buckman Center for International Education maintains a list of affiliated programs that Rhodes students can attend for one semester with no additional tuition or fees. Per their official policy &quot;students pay tuition, room, and board as normal to Rhodes, including any federal and institutional aid they normally receive, which covers their tuition, room, and board while on the program.&quot; Additionally, the college maintains a list of exceptional programs that are available via a petition process.

=== Mike Curb Institute for Music ===
The Mike Curb Institute for Music was founded in 2006 to foster awareness and understanding of the distinct musical traditions of Memphis and the South and to study the effect music has had on the region&#x27;s culture, history, and economy. Through the areas of preservation, research, leadership, and civic responsibility, the Institute provides support and opportunities for students and faculty, in partnership with the community, to experience and celebrate what Mr. Curb calls the &quot;Tennessee Music Miracle.&quot;

In addition to taking specially offered courses, students have the opportunity to work with the Curb Institute through its fellowships program. As Mike Curb Fellows, students can gain experience in public relations, marketing, video production, audio production, community engagement, and extensive research/writing projects.

==== The Audubon Sessions: &quot;An Evening at Elvis&quot;&#x27; ====
In March 1956, Elvis Presley purchased his first home—a four-bedroom ranch house at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis—with the money he earned off the royalties of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. He lived there for thirteen months with his parents and grandmother before they moved to Graceland. During this time, Elvis would make his iconic appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, record such hits as &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel,&quot; and begin his storied movie career. In 2006, Mike Curb purchased the home for Rhodes, with the idea that it would be used by the college as an extension of the Curb Institute. Curb Fellows now use the house for interviews, recording, and projects like &quot;The Audubon Sessions&quot;.

&quot;The Audubon Sessions&quot; is a student-produced house concert series that takes place at 1034 Audubon Drive. Guest artists are invited to the house to perform and discuss their careers and thoughts about music and life, especially in the context of Memphis and the region. Rhodes students produce, film, record, and edit the shows alongside professionals such as New School Media and producer/engineer Doug Easley, and partners such as the Levitt Shell and Stax Museum of American Soul Music. After 4 years as a web series, the show has now evolved into a program that launches nationally to public arts television stations through a collaboration with NECAT.

Over the last couple years the house has hosted concerts by Mississippi bluesman Bobby Rush, singer-songwriter and Memphis native Rosanne Cash, Southern roots chanteuse Valerie June, guitar great Bill Frisell, jazz giant Charles Lloyd, Memphis alt band Star and Micey, and Memphis rapper PreauXX.

=== The &quot;Search&quot; course ===

First required for entering freshman in 1945, The Search for Values in the Light of Western History and Religion, known affectionately as &quot;Search,&quot; is a two-year, intensive study of the literature, philosophy, religion, and history of the West from &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; to modern times. The course is a central facet of Rhodes&#x27; Foundations Curriculum and can be seen as the college&#x27;s take on the Great Books Program. Although Search has evolved over its history, the course remains a rite of passage for all Rhodes students and is seen as &quot;the defining academic experience at Rhodes&quot; and &quot;the soul of the college.&quot; The success of the program has inspired similar efforts at other colleges and universities, such as Davidson, LSU, and .

The 2016 Rhodes College Course Catalogue offers this description the Search course: Throughout its sixty-six year history, Search has embodied the College&#x27;s guiding concern for helping students to become men and women of purpose, to think critically and intelligently about their own moral views, and to approach the challenges of social and moral life sensitively and deliberately. Students are encouraged to engage texts directly and to confront the questions and issues they encounter through discussions with their peers, exploratory writing assignments, and ongoing personal reflection. Special emphasis is given to the development and cultivation of critical thinking and writing skills under the tutelage of a diverse faculty drawn from academic disciplines across the Humanities, Fine Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.Although the exact assignments vary year to year, students read from primary sources that span the millennia of recorded Western history and thought. The curriculum has included readings from: &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh,&quot; the Bible, the Quran, Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Aristophanes, Sophocles, Thucydides, Euripides, Livy, Plutarch, Horace, Ovid, Lucretius, Seneca, Cicero, Augustine, Dante, Aquinas, Chaucer, Machiavelli, Petrarch, More, Luther, Shakespeare, Descartes, Locke, Milton, Voltaire, Hume, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Goethe, Swift, Burke, Adam Smith, Benjamin Franklin, Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Kant, Marx, Emerson, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, de Tocqueville, Nietzsche, Darwin, Huxley, Planck, and many more.

Rhodes students are required to take one class from either the Search course or the Life: Then and Now course (&quot;Life&quot;) during each of their first three semesters at Rhodes (4 hours each for a total of 12 credit hours). As such, the course constitutes more than 10% of a student&#x27;s total credits toward graduation.

==Campus==
The campus covers a 123-acre tract in Midtown, Memphis across from Overton Park and the Memphis Zoo. Often cited for its beauty, the campus design is notable for its stone Collegiate Gothic buildings, thirteen of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, Rhodes is a certified Class IV Arboretum, the highest designation granted by the Tennessee Urban Forestry Council, and contains over 120 tree species and more than 1,500 individual trees. In 2017, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; named Rhodes the #1 Most Beautiful College Campus in America in its edition of &quot;The Best 381 Colleges&quot;.

The architecture of Rhodes College is the legacy of President Charles Diehl. The original buildings, including Southwestern Hall (1925), Kennedy Hall (1925), and Robb and White dormitories (1925), were designed by Henry Hibbs in consultation with Charles Klauder, the architect of many buildings at Princeton University. Palmer Hall was renamed Southwestern Hall in April 2019 after the board of trustees unanimously accepted the recommendation of the Palmer Hall Discernment Committee.

Every building on the Rhodes campus is built from three types of stone: the walls are sandstone from Arkansas, the roofs are slate from Vermont, and the door/window frames and decorative carvings are crafted from Indiana limestone. Additionally, each slate roof is built at a precise 52 degree angle and every structure (except for the visual arts building) has leaded stained-glass windows. The visual arts building was designed with standard clear glass windows at the request of the arts faculty and students, who wished to preserve the uncolored natural light to better create and evaluate their work.

President Diehl was particularly concerned about ensuring unity and consistency of design. When the first buildings were being planned in the early 1920s, architect Henry Hibbs chose for the walls a uniquely colorful sandstone with a range of reds, yellows, and browns from a quarry near Bald Knob, Arkansas. To ensure a continuous supply, Rhodes purchased the quarry. After the state decided to build a highway through the quarry in the 1960s, Rhodes was forced to sell the property. Since then, the college has been able to continue the uniformity of its buildings by sourcing the sandstone for the college&#x27;s new buildings from other quarries within a five-mile range of the original source.

Keen-eyed visitors to the Rhodes campus may also spot four limestone gargoyles hidden among the stones of the college&#x27;s buildings. These likenesses of former college presidents Peyton Rhodes, James Daughdrill, and Bill Troutt, in addition to a tribute to former college first lady Carole Troutt, are tokens of gratitude added by the generations stonecutters who enjoyed employment from the college.

The campus was used as the setting of the 1984 movie &quot;Making the Grade&quot;.
==Students and faculty==
The Rhodes student body represents 46 states, the District of Columbia, and 43 foreign countries. Additionally, 20% are minorities, and 30% are multicultural and international students. The student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1 and the average class size is 14. Some of the college&#x27;s approximately 50 majors and minors include International Studies, Economics, Computer Science, Commerce and Business, Biology, Political Science, and Political Economy. Over 95% of Rhodes&#x27; 224 faculty members hold the highest degree in their field, and no classes at the college are taught by teaching assistants.

== Honor Code and other traditions ==
Central to the life of the college is its Honor Code, administered by students through the Honor Council. Every student is required to sign the Code, which reads, &quot;As a member of the Rhodes College community, I pledge my full and steadfast support to the Honor System and agree neither to lie, cheat, nor steal and to report any such violation that I may witness.&quot; Because of this, students enjoy a campus-wide community of trust and mutual respect.

The Seal of Rhodes College is located in the Cloister of Southwestern Hall. Tradition holds that students stepping on the seal will not graduate on time, if at all. The senior class finally gets a chance to cross the seal during their procession to Fisher Garden during Commencement.

&quot;Rites of Spring&quot; is Rhodes&#x27; annual three-day music festival in early April that typically attracts several major bands from around the country. Past performers include The Black Keys, Coolio, Old Crow Medicine Show, Grace Potter, and G-Easy. Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Rites to Play&quot; has in recent years brought elementary-school-age children to the campus. Rhodes students plan, organize, and execute a carnival for the children, who are sponsored by community agencies and schools that partner with Rhodes.

==Athletics==
Rhodes&#x27; mascot is the lynx, and the school colors are cardinal and black.

The Lynx compete in NCAA Division III in the Southern Athletic Association. Prior to joining the SAA, Rhodes was a founding member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

Rhodes has four team athletic national championships to its credit, with the baseball team earning a title in 1961 and the women&#x27;s golf team earning three from 2014 to 2017.

=== Rivalry with Sewanee ===

In 2012, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that the annual football rivalry between Rhodes and is the longest continuously running college football rivalry in the Southern United States:The longest consecutively played college football game below the Mason-Dixon line (since 1899) has the manners and traditions of the South without all the excesses of big-time conferences.The exchange of the Edmund Orgill Trophy was added to the series in 1954, and the prize takes the form of a large silver bowl that is engraved with the result of each year&#x27;s game. The name honors the Memphis mayor that served on the boards of both colleges.

Rhodes currently leads the trophy series 32–28–1, and is one game behind Sewanee in the overall series, with Rhodes winning thirteen of the last sixteen meetings.

==Mock trial==
Rhodes College provides an undergraduate mock trial program that has won four national championships and participated in ten national final rounds. The program was founded in 1986 by Professor Marcus Pohlmann. Rhodes qualified to the American Mock Trial Association&#x27;s National Championship tournament every year since its inception (a national record) until 2021, with thirty-two top ten or Honorable Mention finishes and over one hundred and thirty All-American attorney and witness awards.

Buckman Hall houses a replica courtroom used by the teams for practicing. Every spring, Rhodes hosts one of the nine AMTA Opening Round Championship tournaments in the Shelby County Courthouse in downtown Memphis. The program also hosts an informal invitational scrimmage tournament in Buckman Hall every autumn.

==Greek system==
There are a number of social fraternities and sororities at Rhodes.

President Charles Diehl prescribed certain rules regarding the design of the fraternity and sorority lodges. Each features the same Arkansas sandstone walls, Vermont slate roofs, Indiana limestone trim, and stained glass windows as the rest of campus. As a result, Rhodes&#x27; fraternity and sorority rows are composed of domestic-scale Gothic lodges featuring variations on the college&#x27;s distinctive architecture.

<text>Baron Brocket, of Brocket Hall in the County of Hertford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 19 January 1933 for the businessman Sir Charles Nall-Cain, 1st Baronet. He was chairman of the brewing firm of Robert Cain &amp; Sons (later Walker Cain Ltd), which had been founded by his father Robert Cain. Before his elevation to the peerage, Nall-Cain had been created a baronet, of the Node, in 1921. His son, the second Baron, represented Wavertree in the House of Commons as a Conservative. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron, who succeeded in 1967.

Another member of the family was William Ernest Cain, elder brother of the first Baron Brocket. He was created a baronet, of Wargrave in the County of Berkshire, in 1920. This title became extinct in 1969.

The barons&#x27; Latin motto is &quot;Felis demulcta mitis&quot; (A stroked cat is gentle).

The family seat is Brocket Hall, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The family also previously owned Bramshill Park, near Bramshill, Hampshire and Carton House, County Kildare, Ireland.

<text>USS &quot;Point Cruz&quot; was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

Originally named &quot;Trocadero Bay&quot; until 5 June 1944 when it was renamed after the Honiara suburb Point Cruz, which was the site of heavy fighting during the Guadalcanal Campaign. She was laid down on 4 December 1944 by Todd Pacific Shipyards Incorporated, Tacoma, Washington; launched on 18 May 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Earl R. DeLong; and commissioned on 16 October 1945.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Point Cruz&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was laid down at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, originally under the name &quot;Trocadero Bay&quot;, on 4 December 1944. During construction, she was renamed &quot;Point Cruz&quot;, after a significant battle fought during the Guadalcanal campaign in November 1942. The completed hull was launched on 18 May 1945 and commissioned into active service on 16 October, after the end of World War II. The ship thereafter conducted acceptance sea trials, followed by a shakedown cruise. From October 1945 to March 1946, she carried out pilot qualification training off the West Coast of the United States. &quot;Point Cruz&quot; was then used to transfer aircraft to American military bases in the western Pacific over the next year. She returned to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 3 March 1947, where she was mothballed and then decommissioned on 30 June. She was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, based in Bremerton, Washington.

The Korean War broke out in 1950, preparations were made to reactivate &quot;Point Cruz&quot; as part of wartime mobilization. She was recommissioned on 26 July 1951, and then underwent extensive modifications to convert the ship for helicopter operations. She got underway on 4 January 1953 for operations off the coast of Korea as part of an anti-submarine warfare hunter-killer group. During this period, she was based in Sasebo, Japan. During this period, she carried squadrons VMA-332, flying Vought F4U Corsair fighters and Grumman TBF Avenger anti-submarine patrol bombers, respectively. She patrolled the coast of Korea through early 1953, until the Korean Armistice Agreement ended hostilities in July. &quot;Point Cruz&quot; thereafter contributed her helicopters to an airlift effort to move Indian soldiers to Panmunjon to supervise the exchange of prisoners of war at the Joint Security Area.

&quot;Point Cruz&quot; arrived back in San Diego, California, in late December 1953. She took part in training exercises and then underwent an overhaul for periodic maintenance. On 24 August 1955, she got underway for another deployment to the western Pacific, serving as the flagship of Carrier Division 15, part of 7th Fleet. Her stay in the western Pacific was short, and on 31 January 1956, she left Yokosuka, Japan, to return home, arriving in Long Beach, California, in early February. From there, she returned to Puget Sound to be mothballed again. She was decommissioned on 31 August and allocated to the Bremerton Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. During this period, on 17 May 1957, she received the new hull number AKV-19. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships were no longer useful to the Navy, as they were to small to operate the latest generation of anti-submarine aircraft, which were much larger and heavier; instead, over the course of the mid-1950s, they replaced them with much larger s. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive.

On 23 August 1965, &quot;Point Cruz&quot; was recommissioned and transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service, now using the hull number T-AKV-19. She was used as an aircraft transport in Southeast Asia, supporting American forces during the Vietnam War. The ship was eventually struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1970.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The keel for the ship, originally named &quot;Saltery Bay&quot;, was laid down on 5 June 1944 at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington. She was launched on 17 March 1945, and during construction, she was renamed &quot;Saidor&quot;, after the eponymous village that had been invaded by Allied forces in January 1944. After work was completed on the ship, she was commissioned on 4 September 1945, shortly after the surrender of Japan ended World War II. &quot;Saidor&quot; conducted her initial training and shakedown cruise off the West Coast of the United States, and then operated out of Pearl Harbor from 12 December to 20 March 1946. &quot;Saidor&quot; was thereafter temporarily transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, operating from Norfolk, Virginia, from 16 to 22 April. She then returned to California.

On 6 May, she departed for the Bikini Atoll in support of the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests. From 1 to 25 July, men from the ship photographed the tests to document their effects and processed the film. She got underway again on 4 August to return to San Diego. She remained there for the rest of the year, and in 1947, her crew began work to deactivate the ship. &quot;Saidor&quot; was decommissioned on 12 September 1947 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, still based in San Diego. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so the rest of the class remained laid up, and they were soon replaced in the ASW role by much larger s. She was reclassified with the hull number CVHE-117 on 12 June 1955, and then again with the number AKV-17 on 7 May 1959. She remained in the fleet&#x27;s inventory for another decade, before ultimately being struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1970. She was then sold on 22 October 1971 to the Portland, Oregon, based ship breaking firm American Ship Dismantlers.

<text>USS &quot;Sicily&quot; was a in the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

She was named in honor of the successful Allied invasion of Sicily during World War II. &quot;Sicily&quot; was laid down on 23 October 1944 by Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Tacoma, Washington, as &quot;Sandy Bay&quot;; launched on 14 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Julius Vanderwiele; renamed &quot;Sicily&quot; on 5 June 1945; and commissioned on 27 February 1946, Capt. B. W. Wright in command.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Sicily&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was laid down at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, on 23 October 1944. She was launched on 14 April, originally named &quot;Sandy Bay&quot;, but on 5 June was renamed &quot;Sicily&quot; for the Battle of Sicily, fought in July and August 1943. After completing fitting-out work, she was commissioned into active service on 27 February 1946, by which time World War II had ended. She moved to Portland, Oregon, for final fitting out, before continuing on to Seattle, Washington, for supplies, and then sailing on to San Diego, California. &quot;Sicily&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise off the coast of California in April and early May. On 15 May, the ship received orders to proceed to New York. After passing through the Panama Canal and stopping briefly at Norfolk, Virginia, she arrived in New York on 6 June and entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard. On 30 September, she departed for Argentia, Newfoundland, to participate in cold weather training. &quot;Sicily&quot; operated as part of the Atlantic Fleet for the next three years, based in Norfolk.

On 3 April 1950, &quot;Sicily&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet, based in San Diego, California, where she arrived on 28 April. The outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June interrupted plans for anti-submarine warfare training over the summer, leading to &quot;Sicily&quot;″s deployment to East Asian waters on 2 July. The ship got underway on 4 July to begin operations off Korea as the flagship of Carrier Division 15. She launched air strikes against North Korean positions using the fighters of VMF-214 on 3 August. She supported Allied ground operations at Pohang, the Battle of Inchon, the Second Battle of Seoul, and the marines&#x27; withdrawal after the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. On 5 February 1951, &quot;Sicily&quot; returned to San Diego. Her next deployment to Korea began on 13 May, which saw the ship resume combat operations off the eastern and western coasts of Korea until 12 October. Her third and final tour of the war lasted from 8 May 1952 to 4 December; during this period, she served with the United Nations Escort and Blockading Force.

&quot;Sicily&quot; made a fourth cruise in East Asian waters beginning on 14 July 1953, shortly before the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the fighting in Korea. &quot;Sicily&quot; received five battle stars for her operations during the war. Her voyage in the region lasted until 25 February 1954. After arriving back in California, the ship was decommissioned and allocated to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. She remained in the reserve fleet for the next six years. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1960 before being sold on 31 October to the Nicolai Joffe Corporation, to be broken up.

<text>Baron Birdwood, of Anzac and of Totnes in the County of Devon, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

It was created on 25 January 1938 for Sir William Birdwood, 1st Baronet. He is chiefly remembered as the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) during the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915. Birdwood had already been created a Baronet, of Anzac and Totnes, on 29 December 1919.

The first two barons had only one son each; on the death of the 3rd Baron without male issue in 2015, the barony and baronetcy became extinct.

The politician Jane Birdwood, Baroness Birdwood, was the second wife of the second Baron.

<text>Edward Joseph Blackwell (October 10, 1929 – October 7, 1992) was an American jazz drummer, best known known for his work with saxophonist Ornette Coleman.

==Biography==
Blackwell was born in New Orleans on October 10, 1929. His career began there in the 1950s, where he played in a bebop quintet with pianist Ellis Marsalis and clarinetist Alvin Batiste and briefly toured with Ray Charles. The second line brass band music of New Orleans greatly influenced Blackwell&#x27;s drumming style. He has also credited his inspiration for playing the drums to his time growing up trying to mimic and match the sounds of his older sisters tap dancing. He would use pots and pans, and old trash cans until he finally received his first drum. 

Blackwell first came to national attention as a member of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s quartet around 1960, when he took over for Billy Higgins during Coleman&#x27;s residency at the Five Spot Café in Manhattan. Blackwell became a pioneering free jazz drummer, fusing New Orleans and African rhythms with bebop. Blackwell later toured and recorded extensively with fellow Coleman veterans Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Dewey Redman, both individually and as the quartet Old and New Dreams.

In 1973, Blackwell became an artist in residence at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.

In 1981, Blackwell performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival, held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Creative Music Studio, alongside Mark Helias, Carlos Ward, and Graham Haynes.

==Life and Career==
===Early Life===
Blackwell was born on October 10, 1929, in New Orleans, and grew in the city’s Garden District. Blackwell grew up in a family rich with diverse indigenous musical tradition, as well as connections to prominent musicians and the recording industry in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. The music of “Dizzy” Gillespie and Charlie Parker, supplied by Blackwell’s older brothers, fostered an early interest in jazz; as well as, the percussive influence of dance as seen in the clubs of New Orleans and from his sister who tap danced. Blackwell began studying under Wilbur Hogan and learned to read music as well as the basics of drumming. This encouraged Blackwell joined his high school’s drum corps. Blackwell did not begin playing the drum set until his first professional gig at the age of 19. 
===Early Career===
Blackwell was first hired as a drummer in 1949 for the Jonson Brothers Band, playing a selection of jump blues, rhythm and blues, as well as shuffle. Blackwell worked with Ray Johnson and John “Plas” Johnson until 1951 when he moved to Los Angeles. During this time in Los Angeles, Blackwell become acquainted with Ornette Coleman. This would be a pivotal connection throughout the rest of Blackwell&#x27;s career. Despite this, he would return to New Orleans in 1956 to play in the American Jazz Quintet with musicians Alvin Batiste, Peter &quot;Chuck&quot; Badie, Ellis Marsalis, Nat Perrilliat. In 1957, Blackwell toured with the Ray Charles Orchestra. After this, Blackwell spent much time playing rhythm and blues in New Orleans despite his personal affinity for bebop to make a living. 
====Early Musical Style====
Much of the earlier playing of Blackwell was inspired by the distinctive second line parade rhythms found in New Orleans in the 30s and 40s, as well as rhythm and blues. Blackwell&#x27;s drumming style in the 50s was heavily influenced by bebop. This most prominently includes the drumming of Kenny Clarke and Max Roach. This is most evident in some earlier recordings from the American Jazz Quintet. During this period, much of Blackwell&#x27;s playing can be described as song like in nature, being repetitive and often combing high and low-pitched beats found on the drum set. Blackwell&#x27;s playing is typically phrased in groups of 4, 8, or 12. Despite the influence of bebop, much of Blackwell&#x27;s original influences can be found in his playing around this time, for example, utilizing combinations of bass drum and cymbal common in the parade music of his childhood.
===Free Jazz Years===
This is the period in which Blackwell is most commonly associated with. By 1960, Blackwell had accepted an invitation to join Ornette Coleman&#x27;s band in New York City. This resulted in a three-month engagement at with Coleman at the Five-Spot as well as going on the road. During this time, he appeared on a number of influential free jazz albums, including This is our Music and Free Jazz. However, after this time Blackwell and other members of the ensemble had very little work otherwise, causing himself and Don Cherry to leave Coleman&#x27;s band. Together they went on to record the albums Complete Communion, Symphony for Improvisers, and Where Is Brooklyn?. That same year, he played drums on The Avant-garde with John Coltrane. In 1961, Blackwell played in the Eric Dolphy-Booker Little Quintet, resulting in a series of successful recordings like the album At The Five Spot. Once again, after this success, Blackwell struggled to find work for a number of years except for a number of small gigs in and around New York City.
====Free Jazz Musical Style====
Despite the avant-garde nature of free jazz, Blackwell&#x27;s playing remains structured and influenced by his previous experiences. Much of free jazz lacks a traditional jazz structure, however, Blackwell frequently incorporates different motivic patterns to create a sense of structure. Typically, the song like aspects of his style also remain present during this time.
===African Influence===
In 1967 and 1968, Blackwell traveled with Randy Weston on a state-funded tour to West Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East. During the tour, Blackwell transcribed many of the traditional rhythms of the places he visited. This exposure coincided with much of the Black Nationalism movement taking hold in the United States throughout the 60s. However, Blackwell never expressed these sentiments and maintained that his connection to Africa during this time was for cultural and musical edification rather than political. During this period, much of Blackwell’s drumming becomes reminiscent of West African drumming techniques, exhibiting a dance-like quality relying heavily on layered polyrhythmic sequences.
===Later Years===
In 1969, Blackwell once again played with Coleman. Short thereafter, he would take a position as an artist-in-residence at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he would teach until his death. Only a few years later in 1973 would his health begin to decline, he would develop chronic kidney malfunction which would require frequent dialysis and limit his ability to travel. This led to a development of frequent health complications like pneumonia, which often made it difficult for him to work. Despite these complications, Blackwell went on to co-found Old and New Dreams with former bandmates Don Cherry and Charlie Haden, they were joined by Dewey Redmen. They recorded two albums under that name in 1976 and 1979. Throughout the 80s Blackwell performed with a number of top free jazz artists including but not limited to: Dennis Charles, Sunny Murray, Steve McCall, Jane Ira Bloom, Anthony Braxton, and David Murray.
==Death==
On October 7, 1992, Blackwell died at the age of 62 years old due to his complications related to chronic kidney failure at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut. He was survived by his wife, Frances Blackwell, and their three children. He was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame the following year.

He was also a Conservative politician and served as Leader of the House of Lords from 1988 to 1990. After the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, Lord Belstead was created a life peer as Baron Ganzoni, of Ipswich in the County of Suffolk, on 17 November 1999, in order to allow him to remain in the House of Lords.

<text>Collin College is a public community college district in Texas. Established in 1985, the district has grown as the county has grown from around 5,000 students in 1986 to more than 58,800 credit and noncredit students.

Formerly known as the Collin County Community College District, CCCCD, or CCCC, the college rebranded itself &quot;Collin College&quot; in March 2007. The district headquarters is in the Collin Higher Education Center in McKinney.

As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of Collin College includes all of Collin County and Rockwall County and the portions of Denton County within the cities of Frisco and The Colony and the portions included within the Celina and Prosper school districts.

==Campuses==

The McKinney Campus (also known as Central Park Campus) opened in 1985. The campus features include a multistory parking garage, library, classrooms, offices, and a student development center. The campus library totals . In January 2016, Collin College added a 125,000-square-foot state-of-the-art Health Sciences Center named after former Collin College district president Cary A. Israel.The Plano Campus (also known as Spring Creek Campus) opened in fall of 1988. By number of students, this campus is the largest and hosts the college district&#x27;s fine arts and athletics programs. The campus features a art gallery, theatre center, gymnasium (Cougar Hall), and tennis facilities. In January 2013, the college opened an 88,000-square-foot library building with majestic architecture inspired by Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s design for the University of Virginia.

The Frisco Campus (also known as Preston Ridge Campus) opened in July 1995. In 2014, thanks to a $2 million gift for scholarships by Roger and Jody Lawler of Frisco, the campus renamed their building from &quot;D Building&quot; to &quot;Lawler Hall&quot; in honor of the donation. Collin College&#x27;s business and high-tech programs are centered at Frisco Campus. The culinary arts program moved there in 2009.

The district administration is located in the Collin Higher Education Center (CHEC) in McKinney. The CHEC hosts – among other things – a number of bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral programs from five North Texas universities: Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, Texas Woman&#x27;s University, the University of Texas at Dallas, Texas Tech University, and the University of North Texas. Offerings vary per university. The center is located at the intersection of the Central Expressway (U.S. Route 75) and Texas State Highway 121.

The Public Safety Training Center (PSTC) in McKinney provides reality-based training for law enforcement and firefighter cadets and active first responders. Training elements include law enforcement and firefighter training areas with simulated retail spaces, office buildings, and living areas for reality-based scenario training, three firearms ranges, specialized gas-fired burn structures, a confined-space rescue simulator, and other training obstacles. The facility, which was built in partnership with the cities of McKinney and Allen, opened in September 2018.

The Technical Campus, located in Allen, opened in the fall of 2020.

The Wylie Campus also opened in the fall of 2020. Designed to support 7,500 students at capacity, the campus&#x27;s opening allowed for the expansion of the college&#x27;s veterinary medicine program. The campus was built in cooperation with the city of Wylie, which donated about 44 acres across the street from the city&#x27;s municipal complex toward the project.

Farmersville Campus opened in March 2021. The first building, a roughly 52,000-square-foot facility, is designed to accommodate 1,250 learners.

Celina Campus opened in the fall of 2021. The first phase of the campus is 96,000 square feet and support up to 2,500 students.

Collin College also educates students at an education center in Rockwall. The following is a list of the college district&#x27;s current and planned campuses.

===2017 bond program and current master plan===
The residents of Collin County approved a $600 million bond proposition in May 2017 to fund the college district&#x27;s master plan. Master plan projects funded by the bond included the Technical Campus, the Wylie Campus, the Public Safety Training Center in McKinney, and safety upgrades to existing campuses. Outstanding projects funded by the bond include planned campuses in Celina and Farmersville, an information technology building at the Frisco Campus, welcome centers at the college&#x27;s existing campuses, and other upgrades to improve student experiences throughout the district.

===Coronavirus deaths===
Collin College has been repeatedly criticized for its lack of transparency regarding COVID-19 on campus and risks of in-person classes. College president Matkin overruled faculty concerns about virus protections in June 2020, stating the campus would remain open. In August 2020, he downplayed the virus, stating the national case count is &quot;clearly inflated&quot;.

During that Fall 2020 semester, a faculty member, a student and a staff member all died of COVID-19. Iris Meda, a recently retired nurse, had begun teaching nursing assistant classes in August 2020. According to her family, she came in contact with a sick student in October and died in mid-November. The staff were informed of her death as an information item 22 paragraphs deep in an email titled &quot;College Update &amp; Happy Thanksgiving!&quot; A student died of COVID-19 in October 2020, and a food-service employee infection led to the closure of the cafeteria, though faculty only learned about the infections informally. The school&#x27;s services went virtual after classes ended for the semester on December 14. Services resumed in-person, in January, after the normal holiday break.

Later, in August 2021, dean of nursing Jane Leach also died from COVID-19.

=== Free speech controversy ===
On February 17, 2021, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) named Collin College to its 10th annual list of the &quot;10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech: 2021&quot; list. FIRE cited Collin College president Neil Matkin&#x27;s public condemnation of a tweet sent by history professor Lora Burnett from her personal account that was critical of then Vice President Mike Pence. FIRE also referenced the senior administration&#x27;s overturning of recommended contract renewals of two faculty members, Audra Heaslip and Suzanne Jones. Both professors had publicly criticized Collin College&#x27;s handling of COVID-19, and they were members of the Collin College chapter of the Texas Faculty Association, a non-bargaining union disliked by college administration. Collin College declined to renew Lora Burnett&#x27;s teaching contract for the following year and later settled a lawsuit over her non-renewal for $70,000 and attorney&#x27;s fees. Jones also sued the university in September 2021 and the litigation for her case is ongoing.

In January 2022, shortly after settling the lawsuit by Professor Burnett, Collin College fired history professor Michael Phillips following his suggestion that students in his classes consider wearing masks. Phillips had served for 13 years as a professor at the college. Earlier in the academic year, Collin College had disciplined Professor Phillips for a Twitter post that revealed the college&#x27;s gag rule banning even the suggestion that students wear masks. According to Professor Phillips, in 2017, President Matkin and other members of the administration admonished him and threatened his job following his campaign to press the city of Dallas to remove its Confederate monuments. On March 8, 2022, Phillips, in conjunction with FIRE, sued the college.

Several Collin College employees have claimed that the college requires many employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, an unusual practice in higher education.

On April 24, 2023, the American Association of University Professors issued a report titled &quot;Egregious Violations of Academic Freedom at Collin College.&quot; It documents the dismissals of Professors Lora Burnett, Suzanne Jones, and Michael Phillips and concludes that they were &quot; compelled to find that general conditions for academic freedom at Collin College are severely degraded.&quot; In a statement, the college replied to the report, maintaining that &quot;that tenure and academic freedom are not unqualified privileges that can be extorted by external groups for their own purposes.&quot;

==Academics==
In addition to associate degrees, the college has bachelor&#x27;s degrees in cybersecurity and nursing established in 2019; this was the first time Collin College made its own bachelor&#x27;s degrees available. The college had worked with university partners to offer their bachelor&#x27;s degrees at its Collin Higher Education Center. In 2021–22, the college conferred 26 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, all of which were in nursing.

==Athletics==
Collin College&#x27;s athletic program offers scholarships in men and women&#x27;s basketball and tennis. The teams are known as the Cougars and Lady Cougars, respectively. They compete in the North Texas Junior College Athletic Conference in the NJCAA Region 5. The Lady Cougars won NTJCAC conference championships in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020.

The competition gym and tennis facilities are located on the Plano (Spring Creek) Campus.

==Awards==
In 2020, the college applied for and was classified among &quot;community engaged&quot; institutions. Collin College was one of three two-year institutions in the nation and one of 119 U.S. colleges and universities to receive the classification; only 11 institutions in Texas were awarded this distinction in 2015 and 2020 combined. That same year, the college was also named a center of excellence in nursing education by the National League for Nursing. The following year, the college&#x27;s respiratory care program received the Distinguished Registered Respiratory Therapist Credentialing Success Award from the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care for the eighth consecutive year. The college was named one of the best higher-education employers in the nation for the second year in a row, according to a survey by The Great Colleges to Work For® program.

<doc id="510969" wikidata="Q273057" url="?curid=510969" title="Discography">
<text>Discography is the study and cataloging of published sound recordings, often by specified artists or within identified music genres. The exact information included varies depending on the type and scope of the discography, but a discography entry for a specific recording will often list such details as the names of the artists involved, the time and place of the recording, the title of the piece performed, release dates, chart positions, and sales figures.

A discography can also refer to the recordings catalogue of an individual artist, group, or orchestra. This is distinct from a sessionography, which is a catalogue of recording sessions, rather than a catalogue of the records, in whatever medium, that are made from those recordings. The two are sometimes confused, especially in jazz, as specific release dates for jazz records are often difficult to ascertain, and session dates are substituted as a means of organizing an artist&#x27;s catalogue.

Another, more recent, definition of discography refers to a collection of musical recordings by a performer or composer, considered as a body of work. For instance, all studio albums by a performer could collectively be considered their discography.

A compilation of a performer&#x27;s piano rolls is called a &quot;rollography.&quot;

== History ==
The term &quot;discography&quot; was popularized in the 1930s by collectors of jazz records, i.e. &#x27;to study and write about the discs of music&#x27;. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records, as record companies did not commonly include that information on or with the records at that time. Two early jazz discographies were &quot;Rhythm on Record&quot; by Hilton Schleman and &quot;Hot Discography&quot; by Charles Delaunay.

==Notable books of discography==
The following books list detailed information on the complete discographies of specific record labels, music scenes or genres.

<doc id="510972" wikidata="Q207205" url="?curid=510972" title="Goldhorn">
<text>In Slovene folklore, Goldhorn or Goldenhorn () is a legendary white chamois buck, or alternatively, an Alpine ibex, that had his realm in the heights of Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia and the highest peak of the Julian Alps. The legend is well known throughout Slovenia (specifically Carinthia), as well as in Austrian Carinthia, and Italian Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

The story about Zlatorog was first written down, adapted to the late Romantic style and published by Karl Deschmann (Karel Dežman) in the &quot;Laibacher Zeitung&quot;, no. 43, on 21 February 1868.

==Story==

===Summary of the story as written by Karl Deschmann===
Goldhorn&#x27;s golden horns were the key to a treasure hidden in the mountains around Triglav. A young and brave hunter from the Trenta Valley fell in love with a beautiful girl and managed to win her heart by bringing her beautiful flowers. However, one day, a rich merchant from Venice came by and tried to gain her attention by giving her golden jewelry and dancing with her. As the hunter approached the girl, she mocked him. The hunter was desperate and left. Persuaded by another hunter, called the green hunter, who was said to have brought about the fate of several honest boys, he decided to go that very night to find Goldhorn and claim his treasure. In the morning, they found the animal, shot it, and pursued it. The dying animal dragged itself onto a narrow, rocky ledge. Suddenly the boy saw on a dangerous trail the most beautiful and healing flowers. The green hunter forced him on to catch the Goldhorn before it ate the magic Triglav flowers that grew from its blood, but it was too late. The Goldhorn had already eaten one and the flower gave it tremendous life power. It ran towards the hunter, who being blinded by the bliss of its golden horns, lost balance and fell from the mountain. The river Soča brought his corpse to the vale.

==Recasts==
The story of Goldhorn was put into verses by Rudolf Baumbach and published in 1877, becoming his most popular work. It was turned into an opera by Camilla and Eduard Lucerna.

==Cultural references==
The first Slovene-language, full-length film, recorded in 1931 by Janko Ravnik, was titled &quot;In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn&quot;.

Zlatorog is also a brand of beer produced by the Laško Brewery.

<text>Baron Bruntisfield, of Boroughmuir in the City of Edinburgh, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1942 for the Scottish Conservative politician and former Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, Sir Victor Warrender, 8th Baronet. The Warrender family descends from George Warrender. He was Lord Provost of Edinburgh and represented Edinburgh in Parliament. In 1715 he was created a baronet, of Lochend in the County of Haddington, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. His grandson, the third Baronet, fought at the Battle of Minden in 1759, represented Haddington Burghs in the House of Commons and served as King&#x27;s Remembrancer of the Court of Exchequer from 1771 to 1791. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baronet. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Haddington Burghs, Truro, Sandwich, Westbury and Honiton and notably served as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1812 to 1812. In 1822 Warrender was admitted to the Privy Council. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the fifth Baronet. His grandson, the seventh Baronet, was a Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy. He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Baronet, who was raised to the peerage as Baron Bruntisfield, of Boroughmuir in the City of Edinburgh, in 1942. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron, who succeeded in 2007. He is a retired officer in the British Army and investment banker.

<doc id="510990" wikidata="Q515880" url="?curid=510990" title="Dutch Reformed Church">
<text>The Dutch Reformed Church (, , abbreviated NHK ) was the largest Christian denomination in the Netherlands from the onset of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century until 1930. It was the traditional denomination of the Dutch royal family and the foremost Protestant denomination until 2004, the year it helped found and merged into the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (the largest Protestant and second largest Christian communion in the Netherlands). It was the larger of the two major Reformed denominations, after the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (&quot;Gereformeerde kerk&quot;) was founded in 1892. It spread to the United States, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and various other world regions through Dutch colonization. Allegiance to the Dutch Reformed Church was a common feature among Dutch immigrant communities around the world and became a crucial part of Afrikaner nationalism in South Africa.

The Dutch Reformed Church was founded in 1571 during the Protestant Reformation in the Calvinist tradition, being shaped theologically by John Calvin, but also other major Reformed theologians. The church was influenced by various theological developments and controversies during its history, including Arminianism, the Nadere Reformatie, and a number of splits in the 19th century that greatly diversified Dutch Calvinism. The church functioned until 2004, the year it merged with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a united church of both Reformed and Evangelical Lutheran theological orientations. At the time of the merger, the Church had 2 million members organised in 1,350 congregations. A minority of members of the church chose not to participate in the merger and instead formed the Restored Reformed Church (HHK).

==Status==

Before the demise of the Dutch Republic in 1795, the Dutch Reformed Church enjoyed the status of &quot;public&quot; or &quot;privileged&quot; church. Though it was never formally adopted as the state religion, the law demanded that every public official should be a communicant member. Consequently, the Church had close relations with the Dutch government. A privilege of members of the Dutch Reformed Church was that they could have their businesses open on Sundays, otherwise considered a religious day and not one for business.

===Disestablishment===
The Dutch Reformed Church was officially disestablished in 1795 with the end of the Republic. Although it remained endorsed by the royal family, the Netherlands never had any public church afterwards.

== History ==
=== Reformation and the Synod of Emden ===

The Reformation was a time of religious violence between the established Catholic Church, Protestants and governments, in some cases. Efforts to form a Reformed church in the southern provinces stemmed from a secret meeting of Protestant leaders at Antwerp in 1566, and despite Spanish repression, many nobles joined the Protestant movement. Two years later, in 1568, following an attack on the Netherlands by the forces of the Duke of Alba, many Netherlanders fled to the German city of Wesel, where a Synod was convened at which the Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism were adopted, and provisions were made for the offices of pastor, elder, teacher and deacon. The first Synod of 23 Dutch Reformed leaders was held in October 1571 in the German city of Emden. The Synod of Emden is generally considered to be the founding of the Dutch Reformed Church, the oldest of the Reformed churches in the Netherlands. The Synod both affirmed the actions of the earlier Synod of Wesel, as well as established presbyterian church government for the Dutch Reformed Church.
=== Synod of Dort ===

The first Synod to be located in the Dutch Republic was held in Dordrecht in 1578. This synodical meeting is not to be confused with the better known Second Synod of Dort of 1618. Large groups of Marranos settled in Emden and converted to Christianity. Mostly all Marranos, many Jewish groups converted to Christianity around 1649 to the Nederduitsche, Niederdeutsche church later on Dutch Reformed Church. In the latter meeting, the Church fathers expelled Arminians and added the Canons of Dort to the Confessions. The Canons of Dort, together with the previously adopted Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism, were called the &quot;Drie formulieren van Enigheid&quot; (Three Forms of Unity). Most conflicts and splits in the Church arose because of disagreement over the substance and interpretation of these doctrinal documents. The government of the Dutch Republic, which had instigated the Arminians&#x27; expulsion, subsequently prohibited the Reformed Church from assembling synodically. No Synod was held in the Netherlands until after the end of the Republic in 1795.

=== Further Reformation ===

The 17th and early 18th centuries were the age of the Dutch Nadere Reformatie (best translated in English as the &quot;Further Reformation&quot;), led primarily by Gisbertus Voetius and Wilhelmus à Brakel, which was greatly influenced by English Puritanism.

=== 19th century splits ===

In the 19th century, theological liberalism led to splits in the Dutch Reformed Church. King William I of the Netherlands imposed a new form of government for the church, in which the civil authorities selected the commissioners to the National Synod in 1816, making it increasingly difficult for ministers to speak out against perceived errors. In 1834, the minister Hendrik de Cock of the town of Ulrum was told by church leaders that he could not preach against certain colleagues, who he believed held erroneous views. He and his congregation seceded from the Dutch Reformed Church. In time, the &quot;Afscheiding&quot; (the Separation) led to the departure of 120 congregations from the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1886, another separation, the &quot;Doleantie&quot;, occurred, led by Dutch Reformed journalist, theologian and politician Abraham Kuyper.

=== 20th century to the present ===
The Dutch Reformed Church remained the largest church body in the Netherlands until the middle of the 20th century, when it was overtaken by the Catholic Church. The rapid secularisation of the Netherlands in the 1960s dramatically reduced participation in the mainstream Protestant church. From the &#x27;60s onward, a number of attempts were made to effect a reunion with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (&quot;Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland&quot;). This led to the two churches uniting with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands (&quot;Evangelisch-Lutherse Kerk in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden&quot;) to establish the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004.

The 2004 merger led to a separation in which a number of congregations and members of the Dutch Reformed Church separated to form the Restored Reformed Church (&quot;Hersteld Hervormde Kerk&quot;). Estimations of their membership vary from 35,000 up to 70,000 in about 120 local congregations served by 88 ministers. The Restored Reformed Church disapproves of the pluralistic nature of the merged church, which they allege contains partly contradicting Reformed and Lutheran confessions. This conservative group also opposes the ordination of women and the blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches, which have been adopted as practices by the merged church.

== International distribution ==
=== Africa ===

Dutch migrants carried the Dutch Reformed Church with them, planting several Reformed denominations in Kenya (The Reformed Church of East Africa), South Africa, including the Three Sister Churches of South Africa (the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) (&quot;Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk&quot;), the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHKA) (&quot;Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk&quot;), the Reformed Churches in South Africa (&quot;Gereformeerde Kerke in Suid-Afrika&quot;)), the Afrikaans Protestant Church (&quot;Afrikaanse Protestantse Kerk&quot;), and the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa (&quot;Verenigende Gereformeerde Kerk in Suid-Afrika&quot;).

=== Asia ===

Through the Dutch East India Company and its workers, the Dutch Reformed Church was established in Ceylon in 1642. The Groote Kerk, built in 1755, still stands in Galle. The Dutch Reformed Church of Ceylon officially changed its name in 2007 to the Christian Reformed Church of Sri Lanka to reflect its Christian identity in the nation, rather than on its Dutch colonial heritage. As of 2007, its membership stands around 5,000, comprising both communicant and baptised members in 29 congregations, preaching stations, and mission outposts. Christianity in Indonesia is strongly influenced under the Dutch reformed church, the first known church established in the country is &quot;De Oude kerk&quot; in Batavia in 1640. Christianity in Indonesia, like Sri Lanka, has been nationalised into different branches of Protestantism while retaining many of the reformed church elements, such as Protestant Church in Indonesia.

=== Americas ===
The Dutch Reformed Church went with migrants to the Americas, beginning in 1628 in New Amsterdam. St. Thomas Reformed Church, founded in 1660 in St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, became the first Dutch Reformed Church in the Caribbean. During the period of Dutch settlement in Brazil in the 17th century colonists organised the Reformed Church
in Pernambuco.

In Canada and the United States, the oldest and second largest body is the Reformed Church in America, which was the American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Netherlands between 1628 and 1819. The Brookville Reformed Church is one of the oldest Dutch Reformed Church built in America. The largest Dutch Reformed body in North America, the Christian Reformed Church in North America, split off from Reformed Church in America in 1857 under the leadership of Gijsbert Haan. Smaller related denominations and federations include the Canadian and American Reformed Churches, the Free Reformed Churches of North America (FRC), the Heritage Reformed Congregations (HRC), the Netherlands Reformed Congregations (NRC), the Protestant Reformed Churches in America (PRC), and the United Reformed Churches in North America (URC). The Dutch were mainly Protestant and Catholic before arrival to America, but became dominantly Protestant after settling in America. They spread their religion by forming bonds with the natives in The Ohio River Valley.

In 1766, ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church founded Queen&#x27;s College, which would later become Rutgers College, in the Province of New Jersey. Today, Rutgers University is a major public research institution in the state of New Jersey. As one of nine colonial colleges clustered in the eastern United States, Rutgers serves as a reminder of early Dutch cultural influence in the North American colonies.

Former U.S. Presidents Martin Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt, both of Dutch descent, were affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church.

<text>California State University, East Bay (Cal State East Bay, CSU East Bay, or CSUEB) is a public university in Hayward, California. The university is part of the California State University system and offers 136 undergraduate and 60 post-baccalaureate areas of study. Founded in 1957, California State University, East Bay has a student body of almost 14,000. As of Fall 2021, it had 863 faculty, of whom 358 (41%) were on the tenure track. The university&#x27;s largest and oldest college campus is located in Hayward, with additional centers in the nearby cities of Oakland and Concord.

With multiple locations across the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area, the school changed its name from California State University, Hayward to its present name in 2005. Cal State East Bay is a Hispanic-serving institution and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution.

== History ==
The university was established as State College for Alameda County (Alameda State College), with its primary mission to serve the higher education needs of both Alameda County and Contra Costa County. Its construction was part of the California Master Plan for Higher Education as proposed by Clark Kerr and the original site for the school was Pleasanton, California. The campus was moved to Hayward before plans were finalized due to the efforts of State Assembly member Carlos Bee and other boosters from the Hayward community, including S.E. Bond Jr, and E. Guy Warren, namesake of Warren Hall. At the time of its opening in 1959, classes were first held on the campus of Sunset High School and then Hayward High School. With the addition of the school, higher education in the San Francisco Bay Area became more accessible. To the south was San Jose State College (now San Jose State University) serving the South Bay counties. To the west was San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) serving San Francisco and San Mateo Counties. To the north is Sonoma State University, serving Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties. Chabot College, a part of the California Community College system, opened nearby in Hayward in 1961.

The university has undergone numerous transitions in its history, making name changes accordingly. In 1961, the school was moved to its present location in the Hayward Hills and renamed Alameda County State College. In 1963, the name was changed to California State College at Hayward. The school was granted university status in 1972, changing its name to California State University, Hayward. In 2005, the university implemented a new, broader mission to serve the eastern San Francisco Bay Area and adopted the name California State University, East Bay. The proposal to rename the campus to California State University, East Bay was approved by the California State University Board of Trustees on January 26, 2005.

=== Presidents ===
Cathy Sandeen, an Oakland native and alumnus of two other California State University institutions: Humboldt State University (B.S. in Speech Pathology &quot;summa cum laude&quot;) and San Francisco State University (M.A. in Broadcast &amp; Electronic Communication Arts), became the sixth president of CSU East Bay on January 4, 2021, following the announcement of her appointment to the position by the Board of Trustees on October, 29, 2020. She previously served as chancellor of the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA). Prior to her time at UAA, Sandeen served as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin Colleges and University of Wisconsin-Extension from 2014 to 2018. In that role, she served as leader and chief administrator and was responsible for the academic, financial and administrative activities of two statewide higher education institutions.

==== Former presidents ====
* Fred F. Harcleroad (1959–1967)
* Ellis E. McCune (1967–1990)
* Norma S. Rees (1990–2006)
* Mohammad H. Qayoumi (2006–2011)
* Leroy M. Morishita (2011–2020)

== Campus ==

The school&#x27;s main campus is located in Hayward, California on a plateau east of the Hayward fault that overlooks the southeast part of the city. CSUEB also has a branch in Concord, California in Contra Costa County, and a professional development center in Oakland. Continuing education programs are available at all three locations.

For 40 years, Warren Hall was CSUEB&#x27;s signature building; the building was visible from cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and served as a landmark for Hayward and the surrounding Eastern San Francisco Bay Area. Warren Hall was rated the least earthquake-safe building in the California State University system by the CSU Seismic Review Board. In January 2013 the CSU Board of Trustees authorized $50 million to demolish the former administrative building and replace it with a new structure. Warren Hall was demolished by implosion on August 17, 2013. Construction for the new 67,000 square foot-building began in November 2013, and doors opened in December 2015 on the completed structure.

California State University, East Bay is also known for its Solar Energy Project. Solar panels were installed on four campus rooftops and are used to generate supplemental power during peak periods and is one of the largest photovoltaic systems in Northern California. Since its completion in 2004 the university has received recognition on a regional and national level for the project; those include:
* A $3.4 million rebate from PG&amp;E, the largest rebate issued to date for solar power installation
* The 2004 Business Environmental Achievement Award from the Hayward City Council
* The 2004 Green Power Leadership Award at the National Green Power Marketing Conference
* A 2005 Exceptional Project Award from the Western Council of Construction Consumers

On April 8, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a fuel cell project of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) allowing Cal State East Bay&#x27;s Hayward campus to become one of the first college campuses in Northern California to have a fuel cell. Once installed, the waste heat generated by the fuel cell will be converted into hot water to be used in campus buildings.

Since 2004, the Pioneer Amphitheatre on campus has been home of the KBLX Stone Soul Picnic, a day-long festival of R&amp;B, soul and Urban Adult Contemporary music. Featured performers have included Ronald Isley, The Whispers, Teena Marie, Rick James, and The O&#x27;Jays. California State University, East Bay&#x27;s Associated Student Incorporated also hosts concerts with artists like Lupe Fiasco and Goapele.

In 2005, Cal State East Bay began to build three new facilities: the Wayne and Gladys Valley Business and Technology Center (VBT), the Pioneer Heights student housing expansion and the University Union annex. The VBT center was dedicated on in February 2007, making it the first new academic building on the Hayward Campus in more than 30 years. The building houses programs in business, technology management, engineering, multimedia, science, and online degree programs. An expansion to Pioneer Heights was dedicated in fall 2008. Student housing was able to accommodate more than 450 new residents and offer a dining commons. An annex to the existing University Union opened in January 2007.

Construction continued with the anticipated dedication of the new Student Services and Administration building in Summer 2010 and the Recreation and Wellness Center in Fall 2010.

The campus is home to the C. E. Smith Museum of Anthropology, created in 1975. The museum, open to the public, has rotating exhibits, and archives including records of 18 Bay Area archaeological sites.

===Mascot===
The mascot of the university is the Pioneer. At the inception of the athletic program in 1961 the student body chose an astronaut as the mascot. In the years since, the mascot took a more terrestrial image; first as a frontiersman with a coonskin cap and then as a cowboy named Pioneer Pete. In October 2018, the Pioneer Pete image was retired, although the university retains the concept of students being &quot;Pioneers&quot;.

<text>Actor–observer asymmetry (also actor–observer bias or actor–observer difference) is a bias one makes when forming attributions about the behavior of others or themselves. When people judge their own behavior, they are more likely to attribute their actions to the particular situation rather than their personality also known as a situational attribution. However, when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person, they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actors&#x27; personality rather than situational factors, also known as dispositional attribution. For example, a politician explaining why they voted against war may say it is because the war is not needed. Whereas a person judging why the politician voted in this way may say it is because the politician is too liberal. Showing how the actor (the politician) explains their behaviour using the situation (the war), but the observer (the civilian) explains their behaviour using the politicians personality (their political standpoint).

Sometimes the actor–observer asymmetry is defined as the fundamental attribution error, which is when people tend to explain behavior on the internal, personal characteristics rather than the external factors or situational influences. However, Malle (2006) highlights that these two phenomena should be distinguished because the fundamental attribution error refers to inferring stable internal traits from behaviour, whereas actor-observer asymmetry specifically refers to explanations of behaviour.

Actor-observer asymmetry is often explained using perspectives and salience. When we are forming attributions for ourselves our perspective highlights the situation, what is occurring around us is most salient. Due to situational factors standing out to us, we may be more likely to make attributions based on that (therefore making situational attributions). Versus when we are judging someone else&#x27;s behaviour, they are the focal point. What they are doing is most salient to us rather than what is occurring in the around them, which may explain more dispositional attributions. Furthermore, when we judge our own behaviour we have much more information available, such as all of the ways we have acted in the past. Whereas, when we judge other people&#x27;s behaviour we have much less information available. This lack of quality information likely also contributes to differences in attributions made. 

The specific hypothesis of an actor–observer asymmetry in attribution was originally proposed by Edward Jones and Richard Nisbett, where they said that &quot;actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor&quot;. Supported by initial evidence, the hypothesis was long held as firmly established. However, a meta-analysis of all the published tests of the hypothesis between 1971 and 2004 found that there was no actor–observer asymmetry of the sort that had been previously proposed. The author of the study interpreted this result not so much as proof that actors and observers explained behavior exactly the same way but as evidence that the original hypothesis was fundamentally flawed in the way it framed people&#x27;s explanations of behavior as attributions to either stable dispositions or the situation.

Considerations of actor–observer differences can be found in other disciplines as well, such as philosophy (e.g. privileged access, incorrigibility), management studies, artificial intelligence, semiotics, anthropology, and political science.

==Background and initial formulation==
The background of this hypothesis was in the 1960s, with social psychology&#x27;s increasing interest in the cognitive mechanisms by which people make sense of their own and other people&#x27;s behavior. This interest was instigated by Fritz Heider&#x27;s book, &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot;, and the research in its wake has become known as &quot;attribution research&quot; or &quot;attribution theory.&quot;

The specific hypothesis of an &quot;actor–observer asymmetry&quot; was first proposed by social psychologists Jones and Nisbett in 1971. Jones and Nisbett hypothesized that these two roles (actors and observers) produce asymmetric explanations. Their research findings were that &quot;there is pervasive tendency for actors to attribute their actions to situational requirements, whereas observers tend to attribute the same actions to stable personal dispositions&quot;. By this theory, a student who studies hard for an exam is likely to explain her own (the actor&#x27;s) intensive studying by referring to the upcoming difficult exam (a situational factor), whereas other people (the observers) are likely to explain her studying by referring to her dispositions, such as being hardworking or ambitious.

==Early evidence==
Soon after the publication of the actor–observer hypothesis, numerous research studies tested its validity, most notably the first such test in 1973 by Nisbett et al. The authors found initial evidence for the hypothesis, and so did Storms, who also examined one possible explanation of the hypothesis: actors explain their behaviors because they attend to the situation (not to their own behaviors) whereas observers attend to the actor&#x27;s behavior (not to the situation). Based largely on this initial supporting evidence, the confidence in the hypothesis became uniformly high.

In the Nisbet et al. (1973) study, actor-observer asymmetry was tested by having participants select between two traits (such as energetic and relaxed), choosing which trait best matched the personality of the target, or if the trait that best matched them depended on the situation. They had participants chose between traits many times to see if participants mainly chose a specific trait or said it depended on the situation. Participants repeated the task saying what trait best matched for different people: their best friend, father, a famous news anchor, and themselves. The results showed that participants more frequently stated that the trait depended on the situation for themselves whereas for others&#x27; they often chose one trait that best described them. This provided evidence for actor-observer asymmetry because participants viewed other&#x27;s personality traits as stable whereas their own as dependent on the situation.

==Recent evidence and refutation==
Over 100 studies have been published since 1971 in which the hypothesis was put to further tests (often in the context of testing another hypothesis about causal attributions). Bertram Malle examined this entire literature in a meta-analysis, finding that, across 170 individual tests, the asymmetry practically did not exist. The average effect sizes, computed in several accepted ways, ranged from d = -0.016 to d = 0.095; corrected for publication bias, the average effect size was 0. Under circumscribed conditions (i.e. if the actor was portrayed as highly idiosyncratic, or in negative events), it could sometimes be found, but under other conditions, the opposite was found. The conclusion was that the widely held assumption of an actor–observer asymmetry was false.

== Cross Cultural Perspective ==

When analyzing actor-observer asymmetry cross-culturally, it is important to understand if there are differences in how cultures make attributions. If it is assumed that the attribution process is universal, then each culture should be equally prone to the actor-observer bias. However, a significant body of literature exists to support the idea that there are cross-cultural differences in the attribution process. Even when considering the fundamental attribution error, it has been extended to be known as the &quot;ultimate attribution error&quot; instead, for initially in its discovery it was assumed to be a universal, or a &quot;fundamental,&quot; phenomenon. It has since been demonstrated that Western cultures are more susceptible to making the fundamental attribution error in comparison to Eastern cultures. Today, the ultimate attribution error is understood to occur when members of an ingroup attribute negative behaviours of an outgroup to their disposition, while they attribute positive behaviours to situational factors. Accordingly, the opposite is true for when members of their own ingroup engage in positive or negative behaviours.

Returning to culture, it is widely understood that collectivist cultures lean towards making situational attributions for the behaviour of others, whereas individualistic cultures opt for dispositional attributions. More specifically, in an 1985 study by Cha &amp; Nam, it was found that Korean individuals used more situationally-relevant information than Americans when making causal attributions. Notably, Choi &amp; Nisbett conducted an experiment where participants witnessed an individual writing an essay maintaining a certain view, and both Americans and Koreans believed that the essay reflected the true views of the writer. However, when put in the same position and asked to write an essay about a particular topic themselves, only the Americans continued to believe that the essay was reflective of the writer&#x27;s attitudes, whereas the Korean participants took into account the situational restraints, and acknowledged that the content of the essay may not truly represent the views held by the writer. Even in regards to interpreting one&#x27;s own behaviour, individualistic cultures possess the tendency to make situational attributions for their own behaviours. This variation may arise out of one&#x27;s need to protect their self-esteem or confidence, but also illustrates the differences in cognition and perception between actors and observers.

Understanding and acknowledging the cultural differences regarding attributional processes is necessary in discussions of the actor-observer effect. If individualistic, collectivist, Eastern, or Western cultures do not emphasize situational and dispositional factors in the same manner, then they are not all equally susceptible to the actor-observer asymmetry. At the same time, there is so much more cross-cultural variance that exists within the general categories of &#x27;Eastern&#x27; and &#x27;Western&#x27; cultures, which is why this perspective of this topic is deserving of significantly more attention and research.

==Related concepts==

===Self-serving bias===
The actor–observer asymmetry is often confused with the hypothesis of a self-serving bias in attribution — the claim that people choose explanations in a strategic way so as to make themselves appear in a more positive light. The difference between the two hypotheses is that the actor–observer asymmetry is expected to hold for all events and behaviors (whether they are positive or negative) and require a specific comparison between actor explanations and observer explanations. The self-serving bias is often formulated as a complete reversal in actors&#x27; and observers&#x27; explanation tendencies as a function of positive or negative events. For example, the self-serving bias holds that for positive events, actors will select explanations that refer to their own dispositions, (e.g., &quot;I am smart&quot;); however, for negative events, actors will select explanations that refer to the situation, (e.g., &quot;the test was hard&quot;).

===Positivity bias===
The actor–observer asymmetry can seem similar to the hypothesis of a positivity bias in attribution — the claim that people are biased toward favorable evaluations. This hypothesis states that people will attribute their behavior with positive consequences to internal factors and their behavior with negative consequences to external factors. 

===Correspondence bias===
Observers tend to attribute the actions of others to their future behavior. When someone witnesses another person&#x27;s actions, they are likely to attribute those same actions to that person&#x27;s future behavior, which is why first impressions are so important. Once an action is observed, it can be difficult for the observer to imagine the actor behaving differently. On the other hand, actors may find it difficult to attribute a single action to their overall behavior. They view themselves as more responsive and in control of situational matters. While actors can attribute their past actions, observers can only attribute the one action they have witnessed to the actor, leading them to attribute dispositional rather than situational factors to the actor&#x27;s behavior.

<doc id="511000" wikidata="Q1984607" url="?curid=511000" title="Phosphocreatine">
<text>Phosphocreatine, also known as creatine phosphate (CP) or PCr (Pcr), is a phosphorylated form of creatine that serves as a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates in skeletal muscle, myocardium and the brain to recycle adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of the cell.

==Chemistry==
In the kidneys, the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of two amino acids — arginine and glycine — into guanidinoacetate (also called glycocyamine or GAA), which is then transported in the blood to the liver. A methyl group is added to GAA from the amino acid methionine by the enzyme GAMT, forming non-phosphorylated creatine. This is then released into the blood by the liver where it travels mainly to the muscle cells (95% of the body&#x27;s creatine is in muscles), and to a lesser extent the brain, heart, and pancreas. Once inside the cells it is transformed into phosphocreatine by the enzyme complex creatine kinase.

Phosphocreatine is able to donate its phosphate group to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process is an important component of all vertebrates&#x27; bioenergetic systems. For instance, while the human body only produces 250 g of ATP daily, it recycles its entire body weight in ATP each day through creatine phosphate.

Phosphocreatine can be broken down into creatinine, which is then excreted in the urine. A 70 kg man contains around 120 g of creatine, with 40% being the unphosphorylated form and 60% as creatine phosphate. Of that amount, 1–2% is broken down and excreted each day as creatinine.

Phosphocreatine is used intravenously in hospitals in some parts of the world for cardiovascular problems under the name Neoton, and also used by some professional athletes, as it is not a controlled substance.

==Function==
Phosphocreatine can anaerobically donate a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP during the first five to eight seconds of a maximal muscular effort. Conversely, excess ATP can be used during a period of low effort to convert creatine back to phosphocreatine.

The reversible phosphorylation of creatine (i.e., both the forward and backward reaction) is catalyzed by several creatine kinases. The presence of creatine kinase (CK-MB, creatine kinase myocardial band) in blood plasma is indicative of tissue damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

The cell&#x27;s ability to generate phosphocreatine from excess ATP during rest, as well as its use of phosphocreatine for quick regeneration of ATP during intense activity, provides a spatial and temporal buffer of ATP concentration. In other words, phosphocreatine acts as high-energy reserve in a coupled reaction; the energy given off from donating the phosphate group is used to regenerate the other compound - in this case, ATP. Phosphocreatine plays a particularly important role in tissues that have high, fluctuating energy demands such as muscle and brain.

== History ==
The discovery of phosphocreatine was reported by Grace and Philip Eggleton of the University of Cambridge and separately by Cyrus Fiske and Yellapragada Subbarow of the Harvard Medical School in 1927. A few years later David Nachmansohn, working under Meyerhof at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Dahlem, Berlin, contributed to the understanding of the phosphocreatine&#x27;s role in the cell.

<doc id="511002" wikidata="Q599675" url="?curid=511002" title="Nwankwo Kanu">
<text>Nwankwo Kanu (born 1 August 1976) is a Nigerian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He was a member of the Nigeria national team, and played for Nigerian club Iwuanyanwu Nationale, Dutch side Ajax, Inter Milan of Italy, and English clubs Arsenal, West Bromwich Albion and Portsmouth. He is widely considered one of the greatest African footballers of all time. A member of the Arsenal &#x27;Invincibles&#x27;, he was named by the club as one of its greatest ever players. He is one of the few Africans to win the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and an Olympic gold medal.

Kanu won a FIFA U-17 World Cup medal, a UEFA Champions League medal, a UEFA Cup medal, a UEFA Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup, 3 Eredivisie titles, three FA Cup medals and two African Player of the Year awards amongst others. He is one of few players to have won the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, UEFA Cup and an Olympic gold medal. As of April 2021, he made the ninth-most substitute appearances in Premier League history, appearing from the bench 118 times, and is regarded as one of the best players in African football history.

He is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and African brand ambassador for digital TV operator StarTimes. He is also the owner of Kanu Sports TV, an Internet sports television company.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Owerri, Imo State, Kanu began his career at local side Federation Works before moving to Iwuanyanwu Nationale. After a notable performance in Nigeria&#x27;s victorious U-17 World Championship campaign, he was signed by Dutch giants AFC Ajax in 1993 for an undisclosed fee. He made his Ajax debut that year and went on to score 25 goals in 54 appearances. Kanu also came on as a sub in Ajax&#x27;s 1995 UEFA Champions League final 1–0 win over AC Milan. The next year, Ajax reached the final again, but lost to Juventus on penalties. Kanu started and played the entirety of that match.

===Inter Milan===
In 1996, Ajax sold Kanu to Serie A side Inter Milan for around $4.7 million. That summer he captained the Nigeria national team that won gold at the Olympics, and scored two late goals in the semi-finals against powerhouses Brazil to overturn a 2–3 scoreline into a 4–3 win in extra time. Kanu was also named African Footballer of the Year for that year.

However, soon after returning from the Olympics, Kanu underwent a medical examination at Inter, which revealed a serious heart defect, and it was believed by doctors that his career was over. He underwent successful surgery in November to replace an aortic valve, and did not return to his club until April 1997. In interviews, Kanu frequently cites his faith as a Christian, and has often mentioned this trying time of his career as an occasion when he prayed to God. Kanu&#x27;s experience also led to his founding the Kanu Heart Foundation, an organisation that helps predominantly young African children who suffer heart defects and whose work was expanded to provide aid for homeless children in 2008.

===Arsenal===
In February 1999, after just twelve league games and one goal for Inter, Kanu was signed by Arsenal for approximately £4.15 million. He made his debut for Arsenal, against Sheffield United in the FA Cup. With the score 1–1 and ten minutes to go, the Sheffield United goalkeeper Alan Kelly kicked the ball out of touch so that treatment could be given to Lee Morris. When the ball was thrown back into play by Ray Parlour, although it was intended for Kelly, Kanu chased the throw-in down the right wing unchallenged and centered the ball for Marc Overmars, who scored to make the match 2–1. After the match, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger accepted that it was not correct sportsmanship and offered to re-play the match which was again won by Arsenal.

Despite the events overshadowing his debut, Kanu&#x27;s career was quickly revived at Arsenal. He scored his first goal for the club in the next round of the cup against Derby County, coming off the bench to net the only goal of the game. He quickly became known for his goal scoring prowess from the bench, scoring important goals against Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa as a substitute. He became very popular among the fans for his two-fingered salute which started in 1999 against Middlesbrough – something that he later explained was based on the team&#x27;s nickname, The Gunners.

Kanu was named African Footballer of the Year for the second time in 1999. In the 1999–2000 season he scored 17 times in 50 matches for the Gunners, including a hat-trick in fifteen minutes against Chelsea in October 1999 to turn a 2–0 deficit into a 3–2 victory. In August 2001, Arsenal rejected a bid from Fulham of around £7m for Kanu. However, Kanu&#x27;s appearances for Arsenal gradually became less frequent, particularly after the emergence of Thierry Henry as Arsenal&#x27;s first choice striker with Kanu being mainly used as a substitute. Kanu then won the 2003 FA Cup with Arsenal. Along with other famous players, such as Henry and Robert Pires, Kanu is a member of the &quot;Invincibles&quot;, the Arsenal side that finished the 2003–04 season of the Premier League undefeated. He played 197 games for Arsenal, scoring 44 goals. In the summer of 2004, after his contract with Arsenal ended, he moved to West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer. In 2008, Kanu was voted 13th in the &quot;Gunners&#x27; Greatest 50 Players&quot; poll.

In the summer of 2006, Kanu played as a guest for Arsenal in Dennis Bergkamp&#x27;s testimonial game, the first match to be played in Arsenal&#x27;s new Emirates Stadium. The game was tied 1–1 when Kanu scored the winning goal, making him the third person to score in the stadium. At the end of the match, Kanu joined the rest of the Arsenal side in hoisting the retired Dutchman on their shoulders as fans gave him a standing ovation.
He remains a popular figure at Arsenal, being applauded when he appears at the Emirates Stadium. During his time with the club, he wore the number 25 shirt.

===West Bromwich Albion===
West Bromwich Albion had just been promoted to the Premier League for the second time in the space of two years. Kanu started as a regular for the club, making his debut in a 1–1 draw away at Blackburn Rovers on 14 August 2004. He scored his first goal for Albion on 18 September 2004, an 88th-minute equalizer in a 1–1 home draw against Fulham. In a match against Middlesbrough on 14 November 2004, Kanu was guilty of an incredible miss in injury time, with Albion 2–1 down. Kanu had sent a low cross over the bar from a yard away from the goal line. Manager Bryan Robson was seen in TV footage mouthing the words &quot;How did he miss that?&quot;, and Kanu&#x27;s howler was crowned &quot;Miss of the Season&quot; by many media outlets in their end-of-season reviews. Nevertheless, the 2004–05 season was ultimately a memorable one for West Bromwich Albion, as they became the first club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being bottom of the table at Christmas.

One of the most memorable games of the 2005–06 season for Kanu came with the visit of his former club Arsenal to The Hawthorns on 15 October 2005. Philippe Senderos put the visitors ahead in the 17th minute, but Kanu equalised shortly before half time. West Brom went on to win the match 2–1 with a spectacular strike from Darren Carter. It was their first home win over Arsenal since 1973, and the first time that they had come from behind to win a Premier League game. But such highlights were rare for Albion that season, and the club was relegated at the end of 2005–06. Kanu&#x27;s contract had expired, and he chose not to renew it. In his two years at The Hawthorns he made a total of 58 appearances – 16 of them as a substitute – and scored nine goals.

===Portsmouth===
Kanu was a free agent following his departure from West Brom, and he signed for Portsmouth on a one-year deal shortly before the start of the 2006–07 season. Pompey had undergone a revival in the second half of the previous campaign, following the return of Harry Redknapp as manager, avoiding relegation by four points after being in serious danger at the turn of the year. At the start of the 2006–07 season, they were undefeated in their first five games, during which they did not concede a single goal. Kanu made his debut for Portsmouth as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers on 19 August 2006, the opening day of the 2006–07 Premier League season. He scored twice and missed a penalty. Kanu went on to finish the season as the top goal scorer for Portsmouth, with 12 goals altogether. He then signed a new one-year deal with the club.

In his second season at Portsmouth, Kanu scored in both the FA Cup 1–0 semi-final win against West Bromwich Albion and the 1–0 win in the final against Cardiff City, earning him a third FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal.

His first goal of the 2008–09 season put Portsmouth 2–0 up in their eventual 2–2 UEFA Cup draw with Italian club AC Milan. He later scored the winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, which ensured Pompey&#x27;s safety. It was his only Premier League goal of 2008–09. He re-signed with Pompey in August 2010, with an eye on becoming a coach when he retired. Kanu signed a three-year deal and kept the number 27 shirt, but was not a regular starter throughout the course of the season and only managed two goals.

During the 2011–12 season, his playing time was reduced, appearing only from the bench. After the departure of Steve Cotterill, and the arrival of Michael Appleton, he was also removed from the bench, due to fitness and injury problems. By May 2012, aided by a point deduction for entering administration Portsmouth had found themselves in a relegation battle which eventually ended in them relegated to League One. To cut costs the Administrator hoped to reach agreement to terminate the contracts of Kanu along with six other players due to them being the highest-earning players at the club. On 9 July 2012, it was announced that Kanu and Aaron Mokoena were expected to leave the club after failing to attend the first day back at pre-season training. Kanu threatened to sue Portsmouth for unpaid back wages. On 30 July, Kanu agreed to leave Portsmouth, but he reiterated that he was still in a dispute over the unpaid wages that the club owed him. In April 2013 he confirmed that he had dropped the case and let the club off the £3 million he claimed he was owed.

==International career==
Kanu was a member of the Nigeria national team from 1994 to 2011, making his debut in a friendly against Sweden. Earlier on at the start of his career, Kanu was instrumental in Nigeria&#x27;s overall success at the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan and their subsequent 2–1 victory over Ghana in the final. With five goals, he was the second joint-scorer in the tournament with Peter Anosike and Manuel Neira, behind compatriot and captain Wilson Oruma.

As well as winning the Olympic gold in the football event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he scored the winning goal in the 4–3 semi-final win over Brazil, his second goal of the match, Kanu participated at the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups. On 24 June 2010, Kanu ended his international career following Nigeria&#x27;s exit from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The Super Eagles lost their group matches against Argentina and Greece, before drawing 2–2 with South Korea. He won 86 caps and scored 13 goals for his country and was the joint most capped Nigerian player of all-time alongside Muda Lawal, until Joseph Yobo surpassed both players in 2012, winning his 87th cap. Despite being a striker, he wore the number 4 shirt for the national team. In 2022, his status was further cemented when he was voted the best Nigerian football player of all time by the prominent Nigerian football site, BetwithMusa.com. This honour recognizes Kanu&#x27;s significant contribution to Nigerian football and his enduring influence on generations of players.

==Style of play==
Despite his physical strength, slender frame, and large stature of 1.97 m (6 ft 6 in), Kanu was a talented player, who was quick and elegant in possession, and who possessed an excellent touch on the ball and nimble footwork; he was also highly regarded in the media for his technical skills, dribbling ability, and close control, as well as his flair and use of feints, which made him an unpredictable player on the pitch. He was also an intelligent player, who possessed good vision and movement, as well as being a good passer, who had the ability to read the game and an eye for the final ball, which – along with his timing and finishing ability – allowed him both to score and create goals; however, he also lacked significant pace, and drew criticism at times in the media over his work-rate, &quot;languid&quot; playing style, and occasional tendency to miss easy goalscoring opportunities.

Although he was often deployed as a striker, his creativity also allowed him to operate in a more withdrawn attacking role behind or supporting the main striker, or even in an advanced playmaking role. Although his height made him a strong presence in the air, he was more adept at scoring with his feet than with his head, despite his size, although he improved upon his aerial game in his later career. He was also known for his determination and ability to hold-up the ball with his back to goal. Moreover, his ability to score decisive goals when coming off the bench earned him a reputation as a &quot;super sub&quot; in the media during his time with Arsenal. However, despite being a gifted player, he was also known for being inconsistent, and his congenital heart defect is thought to have had a negative impact on his career and fitness, although he was able to improve his stamina following corrective surgery through his training. He is considered by pundits to be one of the greatest African players of all time, and by some, as the greatest Nigerian player ever.

==Personal life==
Kanu is a native of Abia State, southeast Nigeria, and a member of the Aro sub-group of the Igbo ethnic group. Nwankwo means &quot;Child born on Nkwo market day&quot; in the Igbo language.

Kanu&#x27;s younger brother, Christopher, was also a footballer, who played as a defender; he also has another younger brother, Ogbonna. Kanu is a Christian.

Kanu was born with a congenital heart defect, which impeded his aortic valve from closing properly; it was discovered and operated on in 1996. Although it was feared that he would not play again, and that it would affect his career, he made a full recovery. He undergoes an annual medical check-up for the condition. In March 2014, he successfully underwent corrective heart surgery once again, in the United States.

==Philanthropy==
Kanu&#x27;s own experience with a congenital heart defect moved him to set up the &quot;Kanu Heart Foundation&quot; in 2000, a foundation which aims to tackle homelessness, and which also built five hospitals in Africa to treat children with undiagnosed heart disease and provide them surgery.

The Kanu Heart Foundation has spent about $4.2 million, an average of $10,000.00 per person, on surgeries outside Nigeria. Tackling homelessness in Africa, Kanu Heart Foundation has to date funded the construction of five hospitals across the continent to treat children with undiagnosed heart disease and provide them life-changing medical care.

<text>Tahoma is a humanist sans-serif typeface that Matthew Carter designed for Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft first distributed it, along with Carter&#x27;s Verdana, as a computer font with Office 97.

While similar to Verdana, Tahoma has a narrower body, smaller counters, much tighter letter spacing, and a more complete Unicode character set. Carter first designed Tahoma as a bitmap font, then &quot;carefully wrapped&quot; TrueType outlines around those bitmaps. Carter based the bold weight on a double pixel width, rendering it closer to a heavy or black weight. In contrast with some other sans-serif typefaces, including Arial, the uppercase &quot;I&quot; (eye) is distinguishable from lowercase &quot;l&quot; (ell), which is especially important in technical publications. Since 2010, Ascender Corporation has offered italic and small caps versions of Tahoma.

Tahoma is often compared with Frutiger, another humanist sans-serif typeface. In an interview by Daniel Will-Harris, Carter acknowledged that Tahoma has some similarities with his earlier Bell Centennial typeface.

The Tahoma typeface family was named after the Native American name for the stratovolcano Mount Rainier (Mount Tahoma), which is a prominent feature of the southern landscape around the Seattle metropolitan area.

==Bundling==
Tahoma was an official font supplied with Office 97, Office 2000, and Office XP, and was freely distributed with Word Viewer 97.

Tahoma was the default screen font used by Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 (replacing MS Sans Serif) and was also used for Skype and Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast packaging and promotional material. Bundled in the font library of Windows, the typeface was widely used as an alternative to Arial. Tahoma was also the default screen font of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 when used Windows Classic theme.

In 2007, Apple announced that Tahoma would be bundled with the next version of Mac OS X v10.5 (&quot;Leopard&quot;). Leopard also shipped with several other previously Microsoft-only fonts, including Microsoft Sans Serif, Arial Unicode, and Wingdings.

As of 2016, Tahoma is still widely in use as a standard in multiple applications and programming environments. For example, a new Delphi VCL application uses Tahoma as its default font.

==Free replacement==
The Wine project includes the free and open-source fonts &quot;Wine Tahoma Regular&quot; and &quot;Wine Tahoma Bold&quot; released under GNU Lesser General Public License designed to have identical metrics to the Tahoma font. This was done because Tahoma is available by default on Windows, and many applications expect the font to be available. Before Wine included a Tahoma replacement font, some applications, such as Steam, would not display any text at all, rendering them nearly unusable.

<doc id="511014" wikidata="Q849538" url="?curid=511014" title="Attribution bias">
<text>In psychology, an attribution bias or attributional errors is a cognitive bias that refers to the systematic errors made when people evaluate or try to find reasons for their own and others&#x27; behaviors. It refers to the systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, often leading to perceptual distortions, inaccurate assessments, or illogical interpretations of events and behaviors.

Attributions are the judgments and assumptions people make about why others behave a certain way. However, these judgments may not always reflect the true situation. Instead of being completely objective, people often make errors in perception that lead to skewed interpretations of social situations. Attribution biases are present in everyday life. For example, when a driver cuts someone off, the person who has been cut off is often more likely to attribute blame to the reckless driver&#x27;s inherent personality traits (e.g., &quot;That driver is rude and incompetent&quot;) rather than situational circumstances (e.g., &quot;That driver may have been late to work and was not paying attention&quot;). 

Additionally, there are many different types of attribution biases, such as the ultimate attribution error, fundamental attribution error, actor-observer bias, and hostile attribution bias. Each of these biases describes a specific tendency that people exhibit when reasoning about the cause of different behaviors.

This field of study helps to understand how people make sense of their own and others&#x27; actions. It also shows us how our preconceptions and mental shortcuts can impact our decision-making. Researchers have delved deeper into these biases and explored how they influence emotions and actions.

==History==

=== Early influences ===

====Attribution theory====
Research on attribution biases is founded in attribution theory, which was proposed to explain why and how people create meaning about others&#x27; and their own behavior. This theory focuses on identifying how an observer uses information in his/her social environment in order to create a causal explanation for events. Attribution theory also provides explanations for why different people can interpret the same event in different ways and what factors contribute to attribution biases.

Psychologist Fritz Heider first discussed attributions in his 1958 book, &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot;. Heider made several contributions that laid the foundation for further research on attribution theory and attribution biases. He noted that people tend to make distinctions between behaviors that are caused by personal disposition versus environmental or situational conditions. He also predicted that people are more likely to explain others&#x27; behavior in terms of dispositional factors (i.e., caused by a given person&#x27;s personality), while ignoring the surrounding situational demands.

====Correspondent inference theory====
Building on Heider&#x27;s early work, other psychologists in the 1960s and 1970s extended work on attributions by offering additional related theories. In 1965, social psychologists Edward E. Jones and Keith Davis proposed an explanation for patterns of attribution termed &quot;correspondent inference theory&quot;. A correspondent inference assumes that a person&#x27;s behavior reflects a stable disposition or personality characteristic instead of a situational factor. They explained that certain conditions make us more likely to make a correspondent inference about someone&#x27;s behavior:

* Intention: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when they interpret someone&#x27;s behavior as intentional, rather than unintentional.
* Social desirability: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when an actor&#x27;s behavior is socially undesirable than when it is conventional.
* Effects of behavior: People are more likely to make a correspondent, or dispositional, inference when someone else&#x27;s actions yield outcomes that are rare or not yielded by other actions.

====Covariation model====
Soon after Jones and Davis first proposed their correspondent inference theory, Harold Kelley, a social psychologist famous for his work on interdependence theory as well as attribution theory, proposed a &quot;covariation model&quot; in 1973 to explain the way people make attributions. This model helped to explain how people choose to attribute a behavior to an internal disposition versus an environmental factor. Kelley used the term &#x27;covariation&#x27; to convey that when making attributions, people have access to information from many observations, across different situations, and at many time points; therefore, people can observe the way a behavior varies under these different conditions and draw conclusions based on that context. He proposed three factors that influence the way individuals explain behavior: 
* Consensus: The extent to which other people behave in the same way. There is high consensus when most people behave consistent with a given action/actor. Low consensus is when not many people behave in this way.
* Consistency: The extent to which a person usually behaves in a given way. There is high consistency when a person almost always behaves in a specific way. Low consistency is when a person almost never behaves like this.
* Distinctiveness: The extent to which an actor&#x27;s behavior in one situation is different from his/her behavior in other situations. There is high distinctiveness when an actor does not behave this way in most situations. Low distinctiveness is when an actor usually behaves in a particular way in most situations.

Kelley proposed that people are more likely to make dispositional attributions when consensus is low (most other people do not behave in the same way), consistency is high (a person behaves this way across most situations), and distinctiveness is low (a person&#x27;s behavior is not unique to this situation). Alternatively, situational attributions are more likely reached when consensus is high, consistency is low, and distinctiveness is high. His research helped to reveal the specific mechanisms underlying the process of making attributions.

===Later development===
As early researchers explored the way people make causal attributions, they also recognized that attributions do not necessarily reflect reality and can be colored by a person&#x27;s own perspective. Certain conditions can prompt people to exhibit attribution bias, or draw inaccurate conclusions about the cause of a given behavior or outcome. In his work on attribution theory, Fritz Heider noted that in ambiguous situations, people make attributions based on their own wants and needs, which are therefore often skewed. He also explained that this tendency was rooted in a need to maintain a positive self-concept, later termed the self-serving bias.

Kelley&#x27;s covariation model also led to the acknowledgment of attribution biases. The model explained the conditions under which people will make informed dispositional versus situational attributions. But, it assumed that people had access to such information (i.e., the consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness of a person&#x27;s behavior). When one does not have access to such information, like when they interact with a stranger, it will result in a tendency to take cognitive shortcuts, resulting in different types of attribution biases, such as the actor-observer bias.

====Cognitive explanation====
Although psychologists agreed that people are prone to these cognitive biases, there existed disagreement concerning the cause of such biases. On one hand, supporters of a &quot;cognitive model&quot; argued that biases were a product of human information processing constraints. One major proponent of this view was Yale psychologist Michael Storms, who proposed this cognitive explanation following his 1973 study of social perception. In his experiment, participants viewed a conversation between two individuals, dubbed Actor One and Actor Two. Some participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor One, such that they were unable to see the front of Actor Two, while other participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor Two, obstructed from the front of Actor One.

Following the conversation, participants were asked to make attributions about the conversationalists. Storms found that participants ascribed more causal influence to the person they were looking at. Thus, participants made different attributions about people depending on the information they had access to. Storms used these results to bolster his theory of cognitively-driven attribution biases; because people have no access to the world except through their own eyes, they are inevitably constrained and consequently prone to biases. Similarly, social psychologist Anthony Greenwald described humans as possessing a &quot;totalitarian ego&quot;, meaning that people view the world through their own personal selves. Therefore, different people may interpret the world differently and in turn reach different conclusions.

====Motivational explanation====
Some researchers criticized the view that attributional biases are a sole product of information processing constraints, arguing that humans do not passively interpret their world and make attributions; rather, they are active and goal-driven beings. Building on this criticism, research began to focus on the role of motives in driving attribution biases. Researchers such as Ziva Kunda drew attention to the motivated aspects of attributions and attribution biases. Kunda in particular argued that certain biases only appear when people are presented with motivational pressures; therefore, they cannot be exclusively explained by an objective cognitive process. More specifically, people are more likely to construct biased social judgments when they are motivated to arrive at a particular conclusion, so long as they can justify this conclusion.

==Current theory==
Early researchers explained attribution biases as cognitively driven and a product of information processing errors. In the early 1980s, studies demonstrated that there may also be a motivational component to attribution biases, such that their own desires and emotions affect how one interprets social information. Current research continues to explore the validity of both of these explanations by examining the function of specific types of attribution biases and their behavioral correlates through a variety of methods (e.g., research with children or using brain imaging techniques).

Recent research on attribution biases has focused on identifying specific types of these biases and their effect on people&#x27;s behavior. Additionally, some psychologists have taken an applied approach and demonstrated how these biases can be understood in real-world contexts (e.g., the workplace or school). Researchers have also used the theoretical framework of attributions and attribution biases in order to modify the way people interpret social information. For example, studies have implemented attributional retraining to help students have more positive perceptions of their own academic abilities (see below for more details).

=== Mental health ===
Studies on attribution bias and mental health suggest that people who have mental illnesses are more likely to hold attribution biases. People who have mental illness tend to have a lower self-esteem, experience social avoidance, and do not commit to improving their overall quality of life, often as a result of lack of motivation. People with these problems tend to feel strongly about their attribution biases and will quickly make their biases known. These problems are called social cognition biases and are even present in those with less severe mental problems. There are many kinds of cognitive biases that affect people in different ways, but all may lead to irrational thinking, judgment, and decision-making.

===Aggression===
Extensive research in both social and developmental psychology has examined the relationship between aggressive behavior and attribution biases, with a specific focus on the hostile attribution bias.

In particular, researchers have consistently found that children who exhibit a hostile attribution bias (tendency to perceive others&#x27; intent as hostile, as opposed to benign) are more likely to engage in aggressive behaviors. More specifically, hostile attribution bias has been associated with reactive aggression, as opposed to proactive aggression, as well as victimization. Whereas proactive aggression is unprovoked and goal-driven, reactive aggression is an angry, retaliatory response to some sort of perceived provocation. Therefore, children who are victims of aggression may develop views of peers as hostile, leading them to be more likely to engage in retaliatory (or reactive) aggression.

Research has also indicated that children can develop hostile attribution bias by engaging in aggression in the context of a video game. In a 1998 study, participants played either a violent or non-violent video game and were then asked to read several hypothetical stories where a peer&#x27;s intent was ambiguous. For example, participants may have read about their peer hitting someone in the head with a ball, but it was unclear whether or not the peer did this intentionally. Participants then responded to questions about their peer&#x27;s intent. The children who played the violent video game were more likely to say that their peer harmed someone on purpose than the participants who played the nonviolent game. This finding provided evidence that exposure to violence and aggression could cause children to develop a short-term hostile attribution bias.

=== Intergroup relations ===
Research has found that humans often exhibit attribution biases when interpreting the behavior of others, and specifically when explaining the behavior of in-group versus out-group members. A review of the literature on intergroup attribution biases noted that people generally favor dispositional explanations of an in-group member&#x27;s positive behavior and situational explanations for an in-group&#x27;s negative behavior. Alternatively, people are more likely to do the opposite when explaining the behavior of an out-group member (i.e., attribute positive behavior to situational factors and negative behavior to disposition). Essentially, group members&#x27; attributions tend to favor the in-group. This finding has implications for understanding other social psychological topics, such as the development and persistence of out-group stereotypes.

Attribution biases in intergroup relations are observed as early as childhood. In particular, elementary school students are more likely to make dispositional attributions when their friends perform positive behaviors, but situational attributions when disliked peers perform positive behaviors. Similarly, children are more likely to attribute friends&#x27; negative behaviors to situational factors, whereas they attribute disliked peers&#x27; negative behaviors to dispositional factors. These findings provide evidence that attribution biases emerge very early on.

=== Academic achievement ===
Although certain attribution biases are associated with maladaptive behaviors, such as aggression, some research has also indicated that these biases are flexible and can be altered to produce positive outcomes. Much of this work falls within the domain of improving academic achievement through attributional retraining. For example, one study found that students who were taught to modify their attributions actually performed better on homework assignments and lecture materials. The retraining process specifically targeted students who tended to attribute poor academic performance to external factors. It taught these students that poor performance was often attributable to internal and unstable factors, such as effort and ability. Therefore, the retraining helped students perceive greater control over their own academic success by altering their attributional process.

More recent research has extended these findings and examined the value of attributional retraining for helping students adjust to an unfamiliar and competitive setting. In one study, first year college students went through attributional retraining following their first exam in a two-semester course. Similar to the previous study, they were taught to make more controllable attributions (e.g., &quot;I can improve my test grade by studying more&quot;) and less uncontrollable attributions (e.g., &quot;No matter what I do, I&#x27;ll fail&quot;). For students who performed low or average on their first exam, attributional retraining resulted in higher in-class test grades and GPA in the second semester. Students who performed well on the first exam were found to have more positive emotions in the second semester following attributional retraining. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for the flexibility and modifiability of attributional biases.

==Limitations of the theory==

There is inconsistency in the claims made by scientists and researchers that attempt to prove or disprove attribution theories and the concept of attributional biases. The theory was formed as a comprehensive explanation of the way people interpret the basis of behaviors in human interactions; however, there have been studies that indicate cultural differences in the attribution biases between people of Eastern, collectivistic societies and Western, individualistic societies. A study done by Thomas Miller shows that when dealing with conflict created by other people, individualistic cultures tend to blame the individual for how people behave (dispositional attributions), whereas collectivist cultures blame the overall situation on how people behave (situational attributions). 

These same findings were replicated in a study done by Michael Morris where an American group and a Chinese group were asked their opinions about the killings perpetrated by Gang Lu at the University of Iowa. The American group focused on the killer&#x27;s own internal problems. The Chinese group focused more on the social conditions surrounding the killing. This reinforces the notion that individualistic and collectivistic cultures tend to focus on different aspects of a situation when making attributions.

Additionally, some scientists believe that attributional biases are only exhibited in certain contexts of interaction, where possible outcomes or expectations make the forming of attributions necessary. These criticisms of the attribution model reveal that the theory may not be a general, universal principle.

==Major attribution biases==
Researchers have identified many different specific types of attribution biases, all of which describe ways in which people exhibit biased interpretations of information. Note that this is not an exhaustive list (see List of attribution biases for more).

===Fundamental attribution error===

The fundamental attribution error refers to a bias in explaining others&#x27; behaviors. According to this error, when someone makes attributions about another person&#x27;s actions, they are likely to overemphasize the role of dispositional factors while minimizing the influence of situational factors. For example, if a person sees a coworker bump into someone on his way to a meeting, that person is more likely to explain this behavior in terms of the coworker&#x27;s carelessness or hastiness rather than considering that he was running late to a meeting.

This term was first proposed in the early 1970s by psychologist Lee Ross following an experiment he conducted with Edward E. Jones and Victor Harris in 1967. In this study, participants were instructed to read two essays; one expressed pro-Castro views, and the other expressed anti-Castro views. Participants were then asked to report their attitudes towards the writers under two separate conditions. When participants were informed that the writers voluntarily chose their position towards Castro, participants predictably expressed more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. However, when participants were told that the writers&#x27; positions were determined by a coin toss rather than their own free will, participants unpredictably continued to express more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. These results demonstrated that participants did not take situational factors into account when evaluating a third party, thus providing evidence for the fundamental attribution error.

===Actor-observer bias===

The actor-observer bias (also called actor–observer asymmetry) can be thought of as an extension of the fundamental attribution error. According to the actor-observer bias, in addition to over-valuing dispositional explanations of others&#x27; behaviors, people tend to under-value dispositional explanations and over-value situational explanations of their &quot;own&quot; behavior. For example, a student who studies may explain her behavior by referencing situational factors (e.g., &quot;I have an exam coming up&quot;), whereas others will explain her studying by referencing dispositional factors (e.g., &quot;She&#x27;s ambitious and hard-working&quot;). This bias was first proposed by Edward E. Jones and Richard E. Nisbett in 1971, who explained that &quot;actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor.&quot;

There has been some controversy over the theoretical foundation of the actor-observer bias. In a 2006 meta-analysis of all published studies of the bias since 1971, the author found that Jones&#x27; and Nisbett&#x27;s original explanation did not hold. Whereas Jones and Nisbett proposed that actors and observers explain behaviors as attributions to either dispositions or situational factors, examining past studies revealed that this assumption may be flawed. Rather, the theoretical reformulation posits that the way people explain behavior depends on whether or not it is intentional, among other things. For more information on this theoretical reformulation, see actor-observer asymmetry, or refer to Malle&#x27;s meta-analysis in #Further reading.

===Self-serving bias===

A self-serving bias refers to people&#x27;s tendency to attribute their successes to internal factors but attribute their failures to external factors. This bias helps to explain why individuals tend to take credit for their own successes while often denying responsibility for failures. For example, a tennis player who wins his match might say, &quot;I won because I&#x27;m a good athlete,&quot; whereas the loser might say, &quot;I lost because the referee was unfair.&quot;

The self-serving bias has been thought of as a means of self-esteem maintenance. A person will feel better about themselves by taking credit for successes and creating external blames for failure. This is further reinforced by research showing that as self-threat increases, people are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias. For example, participants who received negative feedback on a laboratory task were more likely to attribute their task performance to external, rather than internal, factors. The self-serving bias seems to function as an ego-protection mechanism, helping people to better cope with personal failures.

===Hostile attribution bias===
Hostile attribution bias (HAB) has been defined as an interpretive bias wherein individuals exhibit a tendency to interpret others&#x27; ambiguous behaviors as hostile, rather than benign. For example, if a child witnesses two other children whispering, they may assume that the children are talking negatively about them. In this case, the child made an attribution of hostile intent, even though the other children&#x27;s behavior was potentially benign. Research has indicated that there is an association between hostile attribution bias and aggression, such that people who are more likely to interpret someone else&#x27;s behavior as hostile are also more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. See the previous section on aggression for more details on this association.

<doc id="511015" wikidata="Q3830988" url="?curid=511015" title="Let's Go Bang">
<text>Let&#x27;s Go Bang is the second studio album by American actress and singer Jennifer Love Hewitt.

It was released by Atlantic Records on September 12, 1995. It is also the first Hewitt album distributed by Atlantic. The producer, Angelo Montrone, had noticed her musical talents and brought her to the attention of then CEO of Atlantic Records, Doug Morris who then signed her. The album was received with enthusiasm by several program directors at pop radio, however, with the departure of Doug Morris from Atlantic in 1995 the plans for promotion were canceled which led to the album&#x27;s commercial failure, failing to chart on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The album features contributions from Pino Palladino, Steve Ferrone, John Robinson, and Harvey Mason.

One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Free to Be a Woman&quot;, written by Hewitt and Angelo Montrone, would go on to become the theme song for the series &quot;The Modern Girl&quot;, that aired on the Style Network.

==Album title==
For many years, audiences misinterpreted the meaning of going to &quot;bang&quot; and mistook it as a sexual innuendo. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Maxim&quot;, Hewitt was asked to elaborate on the meaning of the song: &quot;It was supposed to be this dance called the &#x27;Bang&#x27;, and the song never hit so we never came up with the dance. Everybody just thought I was a really dirty 16-year-old.&quot;

<text>Media Player Classic (MPC), Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC), and Media Player Classic - Black Edition (MPC-BE) are a family of free and open-source, compact, lightweight, and customizable media players for 32- and 64-bit Microsoft Windows. The original MPC, along with the MPC-HC fork, mimic the simplistic look and feel of Windows Media Player 6.4, but provide most options and features available in modern media players. Variations of the original MPC and its forks are standard media players in the K-Lite Codec Pack and the Combined Community Codec Pack.

This project is now principally maintained by the community at the Doom9 forum. The active forks are Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC) by clsid2 (same developer known as clsid responsible for MPC 6.4.9.1), and Media Player Classic - Black Edition (MPC-BE) by aleksoid.

==Media Player Classic==

The original Media Player Classic was created and maintained by a programmer named &quot;Gabest&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sourceforge/gabest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who also created PCSX2 graphics plugin GSDX. It was developed as a closed-source application, but later relicensed as free software under the terms of the GPL-2.0-or-later license. MPC is hosted under the codice_1 project at SourceForge.net. The project itself is something of an umbrella organization for works by Gabest.

&quot;Media Player Classic&quot; development stalled in May 2006. Gabest, the main developer of the original version, stated in March 2007 that development of &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; is not dead but that he was unable to work on it. MPC 6.4.9.0, released March 20, 2006, is the final official version.

== Forks ==

=== Media Player Classic 6.4.9.1 ===

In August 2007, an unofficially patched and updated build became available, from Doom9 member clsid, hosted under the codice_2 project at SourceForge.net. Known as Media Player Classic 6.4.9.1, it was meant for fixing bugs and updating outdated libraries; its branch&#x27;s development has been inactive since 2011. MPC 6.4.9.1 Revision 107, released February 14, 2010, is the final release version. The community at the Doom9 forum has since further continued the project with MPC-HC.

=== Media Player Classic - Home Cinema ===

A fork, called &quot;Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC)&quot;, adds new features, as well as fixes bugs and updates libraries. It also updated the license to GPL-3.0-or-later.

MPC-HC updates the original player and adds many useful functionalities including the option to remove tearing, additional video decoders (in particular H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-2 with DirectX Video Acceleration support), Enhanced Video Renderer support, and multiple bug fixes. There is also a 64 bit-version of &quot;Media Player Classic - Home Cinema&quot; for the various Windows x64 platforms. MPC-HC requires at least Windows XP Service Pack 3.

As of version 1.4.2499.0, MPC-HC implemented color management support, an uncommon feature that nearly all video players on Microsoft Windows lack. Windows 8 support was introduced in version 1.6.5. Beginning with version 1.6.6 the stable releases are signed.

Apart from stable releases as published, nightly builds are also publicly available. MPC-HC is also distributed in the PortableApps format. MPC-HC 1.7.8 released in 2015 was built with the MediaInfoLib 0.7.71.

MPC-HC 1.7.1 adds support for H.265/HEVC codec.

MPC-HC 1.7.13 is the final version of the program that was officially discontinued as of July 16, 2017 due to a shortage of active developers with C/C++ experience. Its source code on GitHub was last updated on August 27, 2017, a month and a half after the official final version. It requires CPUs with SSE2 support and no longer runs on Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon XP.

==== clsid2&#x27;s fork ====
Updated builds of MPC-HC, a fork from the same developer (known as clsid2 on GitHub/SourceForge) responsible for MPC 6.4.9.1, started appearing in January 2018. This fork contains updated internal codecs (LAV Filters&lt;ref name=&quot;free-codecs/lav_filters&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), AV1 support, youtube-dl integration, a new dark theme, video preview on seekbar, support for MPC Video Renderer, A-B Repeat, subtitle performance improvements; support for Windows XP was dropped in these builds. Binary releases are available, as well as source code.

=== Media Player Classic - Black Edition ===


&quot;Media Player Classic - Black Edition (MPC-BE)&quot; is a fork of MPC and MPC-HC. It moved away from MPC&#x27;s aim to mimic the look and feel of Windows Media Player with updated player controls and provides additional features on top of MPC-HC such as a video preview tooltip when hovering the mouse cursor over the seek bar, as known from video platforms such as YouTube and Dailymotion, though many of these features, including the video preview on seekbar, were added to MPC-HC at a later date.

MPC-BE, however, doesn&#x27;t include LAV filters by default, making it less efficient than MPC-HC for decoding. This is most noticeable with higher resolution files, newer codecs, or on lower end hardware.

Player development began in February 2011. Developers used a modification of MPC-HC made by a programmer nicknamed &quot;bobdynlan&quot;.

The first version (1.0.1.0) was released on September 12, 2012.

Starting with version 1.5.0, released in December 2016, MPC-BE no longer supports Windows XP. Support for Windows Vista ended at version 1.6.7, released May 2023.

MPC-BE version 1.5.1 and newer require SSE2 supporting CPU and no longer run on Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon XP.

Nightly builds are also available.

== Media formats and features ==
:&quot;In this section Media Player Classic and MPC refer to both the original MPC and its forks, unless otherwise specified.&quot;

Media Player Classic is capable of VCD, SVCD, and DVD playback without installation of additional software or codecs. MPC has built-in codecs for MPEG-2 video with support for subtitles and codecs for LPCM, MP2, 3GP, AC3, and DTS audio; along with native playback of the Matroska container format. MPC also contains an improved MPEG splitter that supports playback of VCDs and SVCDs using its VCD/SVCD/XCD Reader. On October 30, 2005, Gabest added MP4 and MPEG-4 Timed Text support. Adobe Flash movies (SWF) can be played and frames jumped to.

Supported media formats within the latest builds of MPC-HC and MPC-BE have been considerably expanded compared to the original MPC, as these builds are bundled with iterations of libavcodec and libavformat. MPC-HC version 1.7.0 and newer utilize LAV filters, while MPC-BE uses FFmpeg directly. Consequently, they support all formats from those libraries.

MPC-HC is also one of the first media players to support Dolby Atmos audio natively. 

MPC can use an INI file in its application folder, making it a portable application.

=== DirectShow ===
Media Player Classic is primarily based on the DirectShow architecture and therefore automatically uses installed DirectShow decoding filters. For instance, after the open source DirectShow decoding filter ffdshow has been installed, fast and high quality decoding and postprocessing of the MPEG-4 ASP, H.264, and Flash Video formats is available in the original MPC. MPC-HC and MPC-BE, however, can play videos in these formats directly without ffdshow.

MPC-HC and MPC-BE also provide DXVA support for compatible Intel, Nvidia, and ATI/AMD video cards when using a compatible codec. This provides hardware-acceleration for playback.

In addition to DirectShow, MPC can also use the QuickTime, RealPlayer, and SHOUTcast codecs and filters (if installed on the computer) to play their native files. Though some of these files may play without the external codecs or filters installed. Alternatively, QuickTime Alternative and Real Alternative can be used in place of their player installations for expanded support of their respective file formats.

=== TV tuners ===
MPC supports playback and recording of television if a supported TV tuner is installed.

<text>HOME STAR, (also spelled &quot;HOMESTAR&quot;), informally known as Cash for Caulkers, is a United States government program proposed in November 2009 to encourage economic growth by offering incentives to homeowners and retailers for improving the energy efficiency of existing homes.

==Background==
In late 2009 there was a broad perception that the United States economy was beginning to recover from the Late-2000s recession. There was a broad perception that government spending authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 had contributed to the recovery, and some desire for the government to do more to encourage job growth and a faster recovery.

In mid-November former president Bill Clinton, and John Doerr of Barack Obama&#x27;s President&#x27;s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, proposed different versions of an economic stimulus program by which the government would offer tax incentives to encourage people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Doerr, in public speeches, called the proposal &quot;cash for caulkers&quot;. Separately U.S. Representative Peter Welch proposed a system of energy rebates to Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s Chief of Staff. Obama, in turn, proposed the idea as part of a larger new stimulus program, at a speech at the Brookings Institution on December 8, 2009.

The stated goals of the proposed program are to reduce pollution, particularly greenhouse gases, by reducing household energy use, to save consumers money in the long term through lower power bills, and to stimulate American businesses through the money spent on appliances, materials, and installation. Improving the energy efficiency of &quot;fixed infrastructure&quot;, which accounts for approximately 40% of all energy use in the United States, is considered the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; of energy conservation - a step that achieves results relatively inexpensively and does not require any new technologies or changes to production or consumption methods.

The name &quot;Homestar&quot; is a reference to the popular energy star electronic device efficiency rating system, and the nickname &quot;Cash for Caulkers&quot; is a play on the earlier cash for clunkers automobile trade-in incentive.

==Structure==
As of December 2009, no proposed legislation had been released, and there were few specific details of how the program would be administered, which federal agencies would be involved, or how the tax incentives would be paid (or to whom). The program is expected to involve preliminary energy audits by private contractor energy experts, who then recommend a series of steps for each homeowner to upgrade their home&#x27;s energy efficiency. As proposed the plan was for the government to pay 50% of the cost of each home improvement project through a rebate, tax credit, or funds paid to manufacturers and retailers, up to a maximum of $12,000 (~$ in ) paid for each home. Alternatively, there was speculation that the federal government might give funds to local governments to run their own programs. There was no limitation on eligibility based on tax bracket or income.

Items under consideration for the program included weatherization of home by installing additional insulation, new doors, and windows, and replacing old appliances with more energy-efficient new ones. Expensive items such as washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, air conditioners, and heaters, would be covered.

The program was expected to cost approximately $10 billion over the course of one year, paid for out of unspent Troubled Asset Relief Program funds, and would reduce energy consumption of homes that took full advantage of the program by up to 20%. To become effective it would have to be part of a bill passed by the United States Congress.

<text>Nkayishana Maphumzana &#x27;Phumuzuzulu&#x27; Solomon kaDinuzulu (1891 – 4 March 1933) was the king of the Zulu nation from 1913 until his death on 4 March 1933 at Kambi at the age of 41 or 42. He was born on the island of St. Helena during the exile there of his father, king Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo.

In conjunction with the ANC he was a founder of the original Inkatha (or &quot;Inkatha kaZulu&quot; as it was known) in the 1920s. It was mainly formed to act as a rallying point against Jan Smuts&#x27; Native Affairs Bill of 1920.

One of his sisters was Princess Magogo kaDinuzulu, who became famous as a singer of traditional Zulu songs as well as for being the mother of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).

He was succeeded by his son Cyprian Bhekuzulu kaSolomon.

<text>Love Songs is the debut studio album by actress and recording artist Jennifer Love Hewitt, released only in Japan on March 21, 1992 by Meldac and distributed by Nippon Crown.

==Background==
Jennifer Love Hewitt recorded a cover version of the Blondie song &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; as a single for release only in Japan. However, that song was not included in the final track list for this album. Production of &quot;Love Songs&quot; began in 1991. The first single released from the album was a cover of the ABBA song &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, on June 21, 1991. The second single, &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Take&quot; which features a rap verse by Hewitt, was released that November. The third and final single, &quot;Please Save Us the World&quot;, was released in 1992. A music video for &quot;Please Save Us the World&quot; was made as part of a United Nations charity effort.

<doc id="511043" wikidata="Q2900783" url="?curid=511043" title="Egocentric bias">
<text>Egocentric bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on one&#x27;s own perspective and/or have a higher opinion of oneself than reality. It appears to be the result of the psychological need to satisfy one&#x27;s ego and to be advantageous for memory consolidation. Research has shown that experiences, ideas, and beliefs are more easily recalled when they match one&#x27;s own, causing an egocentric outlook. Michael Ross and Fiore Sicoly first identified this cognitive bias in their 1979 paper, &quot;Egocentric Biases in Availability and Attribution&quot;. Egocentric bias is referred to by most psychologists as a general umbrella term under which other related phenomena fall.

The effects of egocentric bias can differ based on personal characteristics, such as age and the number of languages one speaks. Thus far, there have been many studies focusing on specific implications of egocentric bias in different contexts. Research on collaborative group tasks have emphasized that people view their own contributions differently than they view that of others. Other areas of research have been aimed at studying how mental health patients display egocentric bias, and at the relationship between egocentric bias and voter distribution. These types of studies surrounding egocentric bias usually involve written or verbal questionnaires, based on the subject&#x27;s personal life or their decision in various hypothetical scenarios.

== History and analysis ==
The term &quot;egocentric bias&quot; was first coined in 1980 by Anthony Greenwald, a psychologist at The Ohio State University. He described it as a phenomenon in which people skew their beliefs so that what they recall from their memory or what they initially understood is different than what actually occurred. He cites research by Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker, who explain that the self-reference effect is the ability of people to recall information better if they think about how the information will affect them during the encoding process (recording memories in their brain). Greenwald argues that the self-reference effect causes people to exaggerate their role in a situation. Furthermore, information is better encoded, and thus people are more likely to suffer from egocentric bias, if they produce information actively rather than passively, such as by having a direct role in the outcome of a situation.

Egocentric bias occurs when people fail to consider situations from other people&#x27;s perspectives. Egocentric bias has influenced ethical judgements to the point where people not only believe that self-interested outcomes are preferential but are also the morally sound way to proceed. People are more inclined to be aware of their own behaviors since they can use their thoughts and emotions to gain more information about themselves. These thoughts and emotions can affect how people view themselves in relation to others in specific situations. A common example arises when people are asked to explain how much credit should be given to each person in a collaborative project. Daniel Schacter, a psychology professor at Harvard University, considers egocentric bias as one of the &quot;seven sins&quot; of memory and essentially reflects the prominent role played by the self when encoding and retrieving episodic memories. As such, people often feel that their contributions to a collaborative project are greater than those of other members, since people tend to focus more on how much they have done.

In social context, egocentric bias influences people to choose a social circle that is capable of maintaining one&#x27;s positive traits. Studies show that one&#x27;s choice of friend or social circle is likely to be dependent on the amount of positive feedback received.

== Examples ==
In a 1993 study conducted in Japan, subjects were asked to write down fair or unfair behaviors that they themselves or others did. When writing about fair behavior, they tended to start with the word &quot;I&quot; rather than &quot;others&quot;. Likewise, they began unfair behaviors with &quot;others&quot; rather than &quot;I&quot;. This demonstrates that people tend to attribute successes and positive behaviors to themselves, while placing the burden of failures and negative behaviors on others. Furthermore, in this study there were gender differences detected; Japanese women, compared to men, remembered the behaviors of others more than their own, and were also more probable to characterize fair or unfair behavior to others compared to themselves.

Another study found that egocentric bias influences perceived fairness. Subjects felt that overpayment to themselves were more fair than overpayment to others; by contrast, they felt the underpayment to themselves were less fair than underpayment to others. Greenberg&#x27;s studies showed that this egocentrism was eliminated when the subjects were put in a self-aware state, which was applied in his study with a mirror being placed in front of the subjects. When a person is not self-aware, they perceive that something can be fair to them but not necessarily fair to others. Therefore, fairness was something biased and subjective. When a person is self-aware, there is a uniform standard of fairness and there is no bias. When made self-aware, subjects rated overpayment and underpayment to both themselves and to others as equally unfair. It is believed that these results were obtained because self-awareness elevated subjects&#x27; concerns about perceived fairness in payment, thereby overriding egocentric tendencies.

The egocentric bias can also be clearly observed in young children, especially those who have not yet developed theory of mind, or the ability to understand concrete situations from the perspective of others. In one study by Wimmer and Perner, a child and a stuffed animal were presented with two differently colored boxes and both are shown that one contains an object of interest. The experimenter then removed the stuffed animal from the room and moved the object into the other box. When asked where the stuffed animal should search for the object, the children overwhelmingly tended to point to the box that they knew the object was in. Rather than thinking about the animal&#x27;s perspective, the children displayed an egocentric bias in assuming that the animal would share their point of view, even though the animal had no way of knowing the same information as them.

== Causes ==
The causes and motivations for egocentric bias were investigated in a 1983 journal entry by Brian Mullen of Murray State University. Inspired by the study by Ross et al. demonstrating the false consensus effect, Mullen&#x27;s paper focused on the overestimation of consensus. Mullen analyzed the NBC television show &quot;Play the Percentages&quot; to determine whether egocentric bias was rooted in a perceptual and unintentional distortion of reality versus a conscious, intentional motivation to appear normalized. Subjects in this analysis were contestants from the show, 20–30 year old middle class married couple with equal gender distribution. At the start of each show, studio audiences were asked several trivia questions, and the percentage of correct answers was recorded for later use in the game. During each round of the game, opposing contestants estimated the percentage of correct answers. The contestant who had a closer estimate wins the percentage of correct answer as a score, and then if they answer said trivia question correctly, wins the remaining percentage for a maximum possible 100 points. The first couple to win 300 points received a cash prize, with the opportunity to win more prizes in bonus rounds. Thus, the show provided incentive for unbiased estimates of consensus. Statistical analysis of the collected data showed that the &quot;egocentric bias of false consensus was observed in spite of the potent incentive for unbiased estimates of consensus.&quot; This analysis ultimately supports the hypothesis that egocentric bias is a result of unintentional perceptual distortion of reality rather than a conscious, intentional motivation to appear normalized.

From a psychological standpoint, memories appear to be stored in the brain in an egocentric manner: the role of oneself is magnified in one&#x27;s experiences to make them more personally relevant and thereby easier to recall. Early childhood memories, therefore, may be more difficult to recall since one&#x27;s sense of self is less developed, so old memories do not connect as strongly to oneself as newer ones. Moreover, egocentric bias may have evolved from hunter-gatherer times, in which communities were small and interdependent enough that individuals could assume that others around them had very similar outlooks. An egocentric view would have reduced cognitive load and increased communication efficiency.

== Effects of personal characteristics ==

=== Age ===
A 2016 study published by Riva, Triscoli, Lamm, Carnaghi, and Silani found that egocentric bias tends to be experienced in a much greater degree by adolescents and older adults than by young and middle aged adults. They examined the emotional effect of visuo-tactile stimulation on pairs of participants from a population of 114 female of varying ages. The varying degree of egocentric bias with age was attributed to the developmental cycle of the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) of the parietal lobe, which finishes developing at the end of adolescence and decays early.

=== Bilingualism ===
Recent studies of egocentric bias have been done in many different subgroups of people, such as bilingual people. A study done by Paula Rubio-Fernández and Sam Glucksberg found that bilingual people are less prone to egocentric bias because they have grown to pay more attention to others&#x27; thoughts. Thus, it is less difficult for them to differentiate between their own opinions and those of others.

== Related phenomena ==

=== False-consensus effect ===

Considered to be a facet of egocentric bias, the false-consensus effect states that people believe their thoughts, actions, and opinions are much more common than they are in reality. When people are asked to make an estimate of a population&#x27;s statistic, they often only have data from themselves and tend to assume that others in the population are similar to them due to egocentric bias. In turn, people tend to overestimate the extent to which their opinion is shared by the rest of the population. Moreover, people tend to believe that those who differ in opinion must be part of a minority and that the majority actually agrees with them. Therefore, the false-consensus effect, or the tendency to deduce judgements from one&#x27;s own opinions, is a direct result of egocentric bias.

A well known example of false-consensus effect is a study published by Ross, Greene and House in 1977. Students are asked to walk around a campus with a sandwich board that bearing the word &quot;repent&quot;. People who agreed to do so (50%) estimated that most of their peers would also agree to do so (average estimation 63.5%). Conversely, those who refused to do the experiment reported that most of their peers would refuse as well.

People who exhibit the false consensus effect take egocentric bias a step further: they not only forgo thinking of other perspectives, but they believe that their viewpoints are those accepted by the majority of people. Nevertheless, some psychologists do not distinguish between egocentric bias and the false consensus effect. For example, in the paper published by Ross, Greene, and House, the terms &quot;false consensus&quot; and &quot;egocentric attribution bias&quot; are used interchangeably. In the second part of their study, they gave out a questionnaire which asked participants which option (out of two choices) they would choose in specified situations, and what percentage of the population would choose which option. In all four scenarios that were given, subjects rated the option that they chose as the most probable. Ross, Greene, and House conclude that their results support the false consensus hypothesis, and that &quot;intuitive estimates of deviance and normalcy, and the host of social inferences and interpersonal responses that accompany such estimates, are systematically and egocentrically biased in accord with his own behavioral choices.&quot;

===Self-serving bias===

A related concept to egocentric bias is self-serving bias, in which one takes undue credit for achievements and blames failures on external forces. However, egocentric bias differs from self-serving bias in that egocentric bias is rooted in an erroneous assumption of other&#x27;s perception of reality, while self-serving bias is an erroneous perception of one&#x27;s own reality. For example, consider a student who earns a low grade in a class. Self-serving bias would result in the assumption that the student&#x27;s low grade is a result of poor teaching, which would direct the fault of one&#x27;s reality away from one&#x27;s own actions.

Egocentric bias might also result in an overestimation of the number of students that received low grades in the class for the purpose to normalize these students&#x27; performance. However, similar to the false-consensus effect, the self-serving bias and the egocentric bias have also been used as interchangeable terms.

Both concepts may be the product of individualistic cultures that usually stress independence and personal achievement over group-oriented success. Cross-cultural studies have found a strong presence of the egocentric bias in the primarily individualistic American, South African, and Yugoslavian communities, but noted the opposite effect in the collectivistic Japanese, Nepali, and Indian societies. People from these cultures tend to demonstrate a bias toward modesty, in which success is attributed to external or group-related factors and failures are seen as the result of personal shortcomings.

=== Bayesian inference ===
Bayesian reasoning is a form of statistical inference that relies on Bayes&#x27; rule to make probability prediction based on given information. In Bayesian updating, people use prior probabilities to make estimates, and then gradually change these probabilities as they gain more information. Bayesian inference is often used by psychologists to determine whether subjects who exhibit the false-consensus effect have a rational thought process. To understand Bayes&#x27; rule, consider an example from an experiment by Kreuger and Clement: there is an urn with 100 chips, some blue and some red, and then subjects are told that the first chip drawn from the urn is blue. Subjects are asked to estimate the probability that the urn contains predominantly blue chips. Using Bayes&#x27; rule, the probability that a blue chip is drawn given that the urn contains predominantly blue chips is equal to the probability of the urn being predominantly blue multiplied by the probability of the urn being predominantly blue given that a blue chip was drawn, all divided by the probability that the urn is predominantly blue. Most participants overestimated the requested probability. Data shows that subjects tend not to pay attention to sample size when making probability predictions. For example, although it has statistically been proven by the law of large numbers that larger samples have less variability, people tend to claim that large and small samples have the same amount of variability. Studies like the urn experiment above provide evidence that the false-consensus effect is not entirely rational, and that egocentric viewpoints tend to be predominant.

== Real-world implications ==

===Collaboration===
Egocentric bias can lead to the devaluation of peer contributions and the amplification of one&#x27;s own work when in a collaborative setting. For example, when group members have been asked to report what percentage of the output they created, the total summed to greater than 100%. Usually, individuals are more easily able to recall their personal contributions and thus believe them to greater or more important. This applies to both positive and negative inputs: in a study of married couples, each spouse rated themselves as more responsible for helpful (cleaning) and detractive activities (causing arguments). Research has shown that feelings of sibling caregivers and their siblings depend on the contact between siblings and their feelings of closeness. Each of these two groups believed that their siblings contributed less to the needs of their family than themselves, and were more resistant to increasing these types of contributions. The closer that siblings were to each other, measured through observation and self reports, the smaller the extent of egocentric bias they felt in reporting each sibling&#x27;s contribution.

===Mental health===
An overly exaggerated or extremely low demonstration of egocentric bias could be an indicator of mental illness. Those with anxiety tend to view themselves as the center of all events around them, regardless of their nature or how unrelated they are to oneself. On the other hand, people suffering from depression may have a lower tendency towards egocentricity, as evidenced by the fact that they tend to more realistically rate their contributions to group work, while non-depressed participants often overreport their additions.

===Voting===
The egocentric bias has also been shown to contribute to a citizen&#x27;s decision to vote in elections. Firstly, people tend to view their personal choice between voting and abstinence as a reflection of those who support the same candidates and issues. Secondly, although each individual vote has very little power in large-scale elections, those who vote overestimate the significance of their ballot. Moreover, citizens demonstrate egocentric bias, in conjunction with the false-consensus effect, in their predictions of election outcomes. A study examining the 2008 American presidential election found that the more strongly people favor a certain candidate, the higher they estimate that candidate&#x27;s likelihood of winning the election. For instance, those who strongly preferred Barack Obama predicted that he had a 65% chance of becoming the president, while those who preferred another candidate approximated that he only had a 40% chance of victory.

<text>Copper(I) oxide or cuprous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Cu2O. It is one of the principal oxides of copper, the other being copper(II) oxide or cupric oxide (CuO).The compound can appear either yellow or red, depending on the size of the particles. Cuprous oxide is found as the mineral cuprite. It is a component of some antifouling paints, but also has other applications including some that exploit its property as a semiconductor.

==Preparation==
Copper(I) oxide may be produced by several methods. Most straightforwardly, it arises via the oxidation of copper metal:
Additives such as water and acids affect the rate as well as the further oxidation to copper(II) oxides. It is also produced commercially by reduction of copper(II) solutions with sulfur dioxide. 

Alternatively, it may be prepared via the reduction of copper(II) acetate with hydrazine:

Aqueous cuprous chloride solutions react with base to give the same material. In all cases, the color of the cuprous oxide is highly sensitive to the procedural details. Cu2O degrades to copper(II) oxide in moist air.

Formation of copper(I) oxide is the basis of the Fehling&#x27;s test and Benedict&#x27;s test for reducing sugars. These sugars reduce an alkaline solution of a copper(II) salt, giving a bright red precipitate of Cu2O.

It forms on silver-plated copper parts exposed to moisture when the silver layer is porous or damaged. This kind of corrosion is known as red plague.

==Properties==
Like all copper(I) compounds, cuprous oxide is diamagnetic. It does not readily hydrate to cuprous hydroxide.

Copper(I) oxide dissolves in concentrated ammonia solution to form the colourless complex [Cu(NH3)2]+, which is easily oxidized in air to the blue [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+. 

Cuprous oxide is attacked by acids. Hydrochloric acid gives the chloride complex . Sulfuric acid and nitric acid produce copper(II) sulfate and copper(II) nitrate, respectively.

== Structure ==

In terms of their coordination spheres, copper centres are 2-coordinated and the oxides are tetrahedral. The structure thus resembles in some sense the main polymorphs of SiO2, but cuprous oxide&#x27;s lattices interpenetrate. Cu2O crystallizes in a cubic structure with a lattice constant &quot;a&quot;l = 4.2696 Å. The copper atoms arrange in a fcc sublattice, the oxygen atoms in a bcc sublattice. One sublattice is shifted by a quarter of the body diagonal. The space group is Pnm, which includes the point group with full octahedral symmetry.

==Applications==
The dominant use of cuprous oxide is as a component of antifouling paints.

Cuprous oxide is also commonly used as a pigment and a fungicide.

===Semiconductor and related uses===
Rectifier diodes based on this material have been used industrially as early as 1924, long before silicon became the standard. Copper(I) oxide is also responsible for the pink color in a positive Benedict&#x27;s test.
In the history of semiconductor physics, Cu2O is one of the most studied materials. Many Semiconductor applications have been demonstrated first in this material:
*Semiconductor diodes
*Phonoritons (&quot;a coherent superposition of exciton, photon, and phonon&quot;)
The lowest excitons in Cu2O are extremely long lived; absorption lineshapes have been demonstrated with neV linewidths, which is the narrowest bulk exciton resonance ever observed. The associated quadrupole polaritons have low group velocity approaching the speed of sound. Thus, light moves almost as slowly as sound in this medium, which results in high polariton densities.
Another unusual feature of the ground state excitons is that all primary scattering mechanisms are known quantitatively. Cu2O was the first substance where an entirely parameter-free model of absorption linewidth broadening by temperature could be established, allowing the corresponding absorption coefficient to be deduced. It can be shown using Cu2O that the Kramers–Kronig relations do not apply to polaritons.

In December 2021, Toshiba disclosed a transparent cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin-film solar cell. The cell achieved an 8.4% energy conversion efficiency, the highest efficiency ever reported for any cell of this type as of 2021. The cells could be used for high-altitude platform station applications and electric vehicles.

==Similar compounds==
An example of natural copper(I,II) oxide is the mineral paramelaconite, Cu4O3 or CuCuO3.

<doc id="511047" wikidata="Q367140" url="?curid=511047" title="Tubular Bells 2003">
<text>Tubular Bells 2003 is the 22nd studio album by English musician Mike Oldfield, released on 26 May 2003 by Warner Music Spain. It is a digital re-recording of his 1973 album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, released almost 30 years earlier. This is the final album in the &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; series.

== Background ==
In 2003, the re-recording rights to Oldfield&#x27;s debut album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; returned to him, which brought about the idea to re-record it to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original. He had always been uncomfortable with the original recording because he had only a few weeks to record it and the technology at the time was unable to cope with all of his requirements. As a result, mistakes could not be fixed and some instruments were out of tune on the 1973 release. Due to contractual reasons no re-recordings were allowed for 25 years after the original release. The release of &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot; took place in the year when Oldfield celebrated his 50th birthday and the 30th anniversary of the original version.

To remain faithful to the original album, Oldfield obtained a copy of the original 16 track tape, from Richard Barrie of AIR Studios; this multitrack was then recorded into Digidesign Pro Tools. There were a few parts of the multitrack recording missing however; this included parts of the &quot;Finale&quot;, &quot;Caveman&quot; and &quot;The Sailors Hornpipe&quot; sections. These original tracks were then moved into Emagic Logic, where Oldfield used MIDI to create a tempo and time signature map; some sections of the original album had not been in time. A guide MIDI keyboard was laid on top, for which Oldfield usually used some Roland Strings. The first instrument to be recorded was the Glockenspiel at the beginning of Part One&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot;, and the final part to be recorded was the &quot;Caveman&quot; vocal track.

The album was released in four versions: a CD in Europe, a CD in North America, and a DVD-Audio edition. The copy protection on the CDs caused many complaints about playback difficulties, including claims of damage to CD and DVD players.

Due to the extensive use of digital technology, &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot; has a more synthesised and brighter sound than the original. Because of the death of Vivian Stanshall, who was the original master of ceremonies on the 1973 release, Oldfield had actor John Cleese introduce the instruments in the &quot;Finale&quot; part.

A CD audio/DVD Video-audio 5.1, was released in Spain and México.

There is a facetious warning inside the cover of CD: &quot;This stereo record can &quot;still&quot; not be played on old tin boxes no matter what they are fitted with. If you are in possession of such equipment please hand it into the nearest police station&quot;. This warning references a similar note, without the word &quot;still&quot;, from the original album.

=== Promo single ===

A video and Spanish promo single were produced for a remix version of the &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; &quot;Introduction&quot; theme, entitled &quot;Introduction 2003&quot;. Released as a single in Spain on 24 April 2003, it features drums and more synthesized instruments, and a conceptual video was also produced. This video is available on the DVD Audio version of &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;.

The second publicly released MusicVR game, &quot;Maestro&quot;, used various extracts from &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;.

<text>Antithrombin (AT) is a small glycoprotein that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system. It is a 464-amino-acid protein produced by the liver. It contains three disulfide bonds and a total of four possible glycosylation sites. α-Antithrombin is the dominant form of antithrombin found in blood plasma and has an oligosaccharide occupying each of its four glycosylation sites. A single glycosylation site remains consistently un-occupied in the minor form of antithrombin, β-antithrombin. Its activity is increased manyfold by the anticoagulant drug heparin, which enhances the binding of antithrombin to factor IIa (thrombin) and factor Xa.

== Structure ==
Antithrombin is also termed antithrombin III (AT III). The designations antithrombin I through to antithrombin IV originate in early studies carried out in the 1950s by Seegers, Johnson and Fell.

Antithrombin I (AT I) refers to the binding of thrombin to fibrin, after thrombin has activated fibrinogen, at a non-catalytic binding site of thrombin. Antithrombin II (AT II) refers to a cofactor in plasma, which together with heparin interferes with the interaction of thrombin and fibrinogen. Antithrombin III (AT III) refers to a substance in plasma that inactivates thrombin. Antithrombin IV (AT IV) refers to an antithrombin that becomes activated during and shortly after blood coagulation. Only AT III and possibly AT I are medically significant. AT III is generally referred to solely as &quot;antithrombin&quot; and it is antithrombin III that is discussed in this article.
Antithrombin has a half-life in blood plasma of around 3 days.
The normal antithrombin concentration in human blood plasma is high at approximately 0.12 mg/ml, which is equivalent to a molar concentration of 2.3 μM.
Antithrombin has been isolated from the plasma of a large number of species additional to humans. As deduced from protein and cDNA sequencing, cow, sheep, rabbit and mouse antithrombins are all 433 amino acids in length, which is one amino acid longer than human antithrombin. The extra amino acid is thought to occur at amino acid position 6. Cow, sheep, rabbit, mouse, and human antithrombins share between 84 and 89% amino acid sequence identity. Six of the amino acids form three intramolecular disulfide bonds, Cys8-Cys128, Cys21-Cys95, and Cys248-Cys430.
They all have four potential N-glycosylation sites. These occur at asparagine (Asn) amino acid numbers 96, 135, 155, and 192 in humans and at similar amino acid numbers in other species. All these sites are occupied by covalently attached oligosaccharide side-chains in the predominant form of human antithrombin, α-antithrombin, resulting in a molecular weight for this form of antithrombin of 58,200. The potential glycosylation site at asparagine 135 is not occupied in a minor form (around 10%) of antithrombin, β-antithrombin (see Figure 1).

Recombinant antithrombins with properties similar to those of normal human antithrombin have been produced using baculovirus-infected insect cells and mammalian cell lines grown in cell culture. These recombinant antithrombins generally have different glycosylation patterns to normal antithrombin and are typically used in antithrombin structural studies. For this reason many of the antithrombin structures stored in the protein data bank and presented in this article show variable glycosylation patterns.

Antithrombin begins in its native state, which has a higher free energy compared to the latent state, which it decays to on average after 3 days. The latent state has the same form as the activated state - that is, when it is inhibiting thrombin. As such it is a classic example of the utility of kinetic vs thermodynamic control of protein folding.

== Function ==
Antithrombin is a serpin (serine protease inhibitor) and is thus similar in structure to most other plasma protease inhibitors, such as alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-antiplasmin and Heparin cofactor II.

The physiological target proteases of antithrombin are those of the &quot;contact activation pathway&quot; (formerly known as the intrinsic pathway), namely the activated forms of Factor X (Xa), Factor IX (IXa), Factor XI (XIa), Factor XII (XIIa) and, to a greater extent, Factor II (thrombin) (IIa), and also the activated form of Factor VII (VIIa) from the &quot;tissue factor pathway&quot; (formerly known as the extrinsic pathway). The inhibitor also inactivates kallikrein and plasmin , also involved in blood coagulation. However it inactivates certain other serine proteases that are not involved in coagulation such as trypsin and the C1s subunit of the enzyme C1 involved in the classical complement pathway.

Protease inactivation results as a consequence of trapping the protease in an equimolar complex with antithrombin in which the active site of the protease enzyme is inaccessible to its usual substrate. The formation of an antithrombin-protease complex involves an interaction between the protease and a specific reactive peptide bond within antithrombin. In human antithrombin this bond is between arginine (arg) 393 and serine (ser) 394 (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).

It is thought that protease enzymes become trapped in inactive antithrombin-protease complexes as a consequence of their attack on the reactive bond. Although attacking a similar bond within the normal protease substrate results in rapid proteolytic cleavage of the substrate, initiating an attack on the antithrombin reactive bond causes antithrombin to become activated and trap the enzyme at an intermediate stage of the proteolytic process. Given time, thrombin is able to cleave the reactive bond within antithrombin and an inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex will dissociate, however the time it takes for this to occur may be greater than 3 days. However, bonds P3-P4 and P1&#x27;-P2&#x27; can be rapidly cleaved by neutrophil elastase and the bacterial enzyme thermolysin, respectively, resulting in inactive antithrombins no longer able to inhibit thrombin activity.

The rate of antithrombin&#x27;s inhibition of protease activity is greatly enhanced by its additional binding to heparin, as is its inactivation by neutrophil elastase.

==Antithrombin and heparin==
Antithrombin inactivates its physiological target enzymes, Thrombin, Factor Xa and Factor IXa with rate constants of 7–11 x 103, 2.5 x 103 M−1 s−1 and 1 x 10 M−1 s−1 respectively. The rate of antithrombin-thrombin inactivation increases to 1.5 - 4 x 107 M−1 s−1 in the presence of heparin, i.e. the reaction is accelerated 2000-4000 fold. Factor Xa inhibition is accelerated by only 500 to 1000 fold in the presence of heparin and the maximal rate constant is 10 fold lower than that of thrombin inhibition. The rate enhancement of antithrombin-Factor IXa inhibition shows an approximate 1 million fold enhancement in the presence of heparin and physiological levels of calcium.

AT-III binds to a specific pentasaccharide sulfation sequence contained within the heparin polymer

GlcNAc/NS(6S)-GlcA-GlcNS(3S,6S)-IdoA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)

Upon binding to this pentasaccharide sequence, inhibition of protease activity is increased by heparin as a result of two distinct mechanisms. In one mechanism heparin stimulation of Factor IXa and Xa inhibition depends on a conformational change within antithrombin involving the reactive site loop and is thus allosteric. In another mechanism stimulation of thrombin inhibition depends on the formation of a ternary complex between AT-III, thrombin, and heparin.

===Allosteric activation===

Increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition requires the minimal heparin pentasaccharide sequence. The conformational changes that occur within antithrombin in response to pentasaccharide binding are well documented.

In the absence of heparin, amino acids P14 and P15 (see Figure 3) from the reactive site loop are embedded within the main body of the protein (specifically the top of beta sheet A). This feature is in common with other serpins such as heparin cofactor II, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and MENT.

The conformational change most relevant for Factor IXa and Xa inhibition involves the P14 and P15 amino acids within the N-terminal region of the reactive site loop (circled in Figure 4 model B). This region has been termed the hinge region. The conformational change within the hinge region in response to heparin binding results in the expulsion of P14 and P15 from the main body of the protein and it has been shown that by preventing this conformational change, increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition does not occur. It is thought that the increased flexibility given to the reactive site loop as a result of the hinge region conformational change is a key factor in influencing increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition. It has been calculated that in the absence of the pentasaccharide only one in every 400 antithrombin molecules (0.25%) is in an active conformation with the P14 and P15 amino acids expelled.

===Non-allosteric activation===

Increased thrombin inhibition requires the minimal heparin pentasaccharide plus at least an additional 13 monomeric units. This is thought to be due to a requirement that antithrombin and thrombin must bind to the same heparin chain adjacent to each other. This can be seen in the series of models shown in Figure 5.

In the structures shown in Figure 5 the C-terminal portion (P&#x27; side) of the reactive site loop is in an extended conformation when compared with other un-activated or heparin activated antithrombin structures. The P&#x27; region of antithrombin is unusually long relative to the P&#x27; region of other serpins and in un-activated or heparin activated antithrombin structures forms a tightly hydrogen bonded β-turn. P&#x27; elongation occurs through the breaking of all hydrogen bonds involved in the β-turn.

The hinge region of antithrombin in the Figure 5 complex could not be modelled due to its conformational flexibility, and amino acids P9-P14 are not seen in this structure. This conformational flexibility indicates an equilibrium may exist within the complex between a P14 P15 reactive site loop inserted antithrombin conformation and a P14 P15 reactive site loop expelled conformation. In support of this, analysis of the positioning of P15 Gly in the Figure 5 complex (labelled in model B) shows it to be inserted into beta sheet A (see model C).

==Effect of glycosylation on activity==
α-Antithrombin and β-antithrombin differ in their affinity for heparin. The difference in dissociation constant between the two is threefold for the pentasaccharide shown in Figure 3 and greater than tenfold for full length heparin, with β-antithrombin having a higher affinity. The higher affinity of β-antithrombin is thought to be due to the increased rate at which subsequent conformational changes occur within the protein upon initial heparin binding. For α-antithrombin, the additional glycosylation at Asn-135 is not thought to interfere with initial heparin binding, but rather to inhibit any resulting conformational changes.

Even though it is present at only 5–10% the levels of α-antithrombin, due to its increased heparin affinity, it is thought that β-antithrombin is more important than α-antithrombin in controlling thrombogenic events resulting from tissue injury. Indeed, thrombin inhibition after injury to the aorta has been attributed solely to β-antithrombin.

== Deficiencies ==

Evidence for the important role antithrombin plays in regulating normal blood coagulation is demonstrated by the correlation between inherited or acquired antithrombin deficiencies and an increased risk of any affected individual developing thrombotic disease. Antithrombin deficiency generally comes to light when a patient suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

===Acquired antithrombin deficiency===
Acquired antithrombin deficiency occurs as a result of three distinctly different mechanisms. The first mechanism is increased excretion which may occur with renal failure associated with proteinuria nephrotic syndrome. The second mechanism results from decreased production as seen in liver failure or cirrhosis or an immature liver secondary to premature birth. The third mechanism results from accelerated consumption which is most pronounced as consequence of severe injury trauma but also may be seen on a lesser scale as a result of interventions such as major surgery or cardiopulmonary bypass.

===Inherited antithrombin deficiency===
The incidence of inherited antithrombin deficiency has been estimated at between 1:2000 and 1:5000 in the normal population, with the first family suffering from inherited antithrombin deficiency being described in 1965. Subsequently, it was proposed that the classification of inherited antithrombin deficiency be designated as either type I or type II, based upon functional and immunochemical antithrombin analyses. Maintenance of an adequate level of antithrombin activity, which is at least 70% that of a normal functional level, is essential to ensure effective inhibition of blood coagulation proteases. Typically as a result of type I or type II antithrombin deficiency, functional antithrombin levels are reduced to below 50% of normal.

====Type I antithrombin deficiency====
Type I antithrombin deficiency is characterized by a decrease in both antithrombin activity and antithrombin concentration in the blood of affected individuals. Type I deficiency was originally further divided into two subgroups, Ia and Ib, based upon heparin affinity. The antithrombin of subgroup Ia individuals showed a normal affinity for heparin while the antithrombin of subgroup Ib individuals showed a reduced affinity for heparin. Subsequent functional analysis of a group of 1b cases found them not only to have reduced heparin affinity but multiple or &#x27;pleiotrophic&#x27; abnormalities affecting the reactive site, the heparin binding site and antithrombin blood concentration. In a revised system of classification adopted by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type Ib cases are now designated as type II PE, Pleiotrophic effect.

Most cases of type I deficiency are due to point mutations, deletions or minor insertions within the antithrombin gene. These genetic mutations result in type I deficiency through a variety of mechanisms:
* Mutations may produce unstable antithrombins that either may be not exported into the blood correctly upon completion biosynthesis or exist in the blood for a shortened period of time, e.g., the deletion of 6 base pairs in codons 106–108.
* Mutations may affect mRNA processing of the antithrombin gene.
* Minor insertions or deletions may lead to frame shift mutations and premature termination of the antithrombin gene.
* Point mutations may also result in the premature generation of a termination or stop codon e.g. the mutation of codon 129, CGA→TGA (UGA after transcription), replaces a normal codon for arginine with a termination codon.

====Type II antithrombin deficiency====
Type II antithrombin deficiency is characterized by normal antithrombin levels but reduced antithrombin activity in the blood of affected individuals. It was originally proposed that type II deficiency be further divided into three subgroups (IIa, IIb, and IIc) depending on which antithrombin functional activity is reduced or retained.
* Subgroup IIa - Decreased thrombin inactivation, decreased factor Xa inactivation and decreased heparin affinity.
* Subgroup IIb - Decreased thrombin inactivation and normal heparin affinity.
* Subgroup IIc - Normal thrombin inactivation, normal factor Xa inactivation and decreased heparin affinity.

In the revised system of classification again adopted by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type II antithrombin deficiency remains subdivided into three subgroups: the already mentioned type II PE, along with type II RS, where mutations effect the reactive site and type II HBS, where mutations effect the antithrombin heparin binding site. For the purposes of an antithrombin mutational database compiled by members of the Plasma Coagulation Inhibitors Subcommittee of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type IIa cases are now classified as type II PE, type IIb cases as type II RS and type IIc cases as type II HBS.

===Toponyms===
Presently it is relatively easy to characterise a specific antithrombin genetic mutation. However prior to the use of modern characterisation techniques investigators named mutations for the town or city where the individual suffering from the deficiency resided i.e. the antithrombin mutation was designated a toponym. Modern mutational characterisation has since shown that many individual antithrombin toponyms are actually the result of the same genetic mutation, for example antithrombin-Toyama, is equivalent to antithrombin-Kumamoto, -Amien, -Tours, -Paris-1, -Paris-2, -Alger, -Padua-2 and -Barcelona.

==Medical uses==
Antithrombin is used as a protein therapeutic that can be purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly (for example Atryn, which is produced in the milk of genetically modified goats).

It is approved by the FDA as an anticoagulant for the prevention of clots before, during, or after surgery or birthing in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency.

It has been studied in sepsis to reduce diffuse intravascular coagulation and other outcomes. It has not been found to confer any benefit in critically ill people with sepsis.

==Cleaved and latent antithrombin==

Cleavage at the reactive site results in entrapment of the thrombin protease, with movement of the cleaved reactive site loop together with the bound protease, such that the
loop forms an extra sixth strand in the middle of beta sheet A. This movement of the reactive site loop can also be induced without cleavage, with the resulting crystallographic structure being identical to that of the physiologically latent conformation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). For this reason the conformation of antithrombin in which the reactive site loop is incorporated uncleaved into the main body of the protein is referred to as latent antithrombin. In contrast to PAI-1 the transition for antithrombin from a normal or native conformation to a latent conformation is irreversible.

Native antithrombin can be converted to latent antithrombin (L-antithrombin) by heating alone or heating in the presence of citrate. However, without extreme heating and at 37 °C (body temperature) 10% of all antithrombin circulating in the blood is converted to the L-antithrombin over a 24-hour period. The structure of L-antithrombin is shown in Figure 6.

The 3-dimensional structure of native antithrombin was first determined in 1994. Unexpectedly the protein crystallized as a heterodimer composed of one molecule of native antithrombin and one molecule of latent antithrombin. Latent antithrombin on formation immediately links to a molecule of native antithrombin to form the heterodimer, and it is not until the concentration of latent antithrombin exceeds 50% of the total antithrombin that it can be detected analytically. Not only is the latent form of antithrombin inactive against its target coagulation proteases, but its dimerisation with an otherwise active native antithrombin molecule also results in the native molecules inactivation. The physiological impact of the loss of antithrombin activity either through latent antithrombin formation or through subsequent dimer formation is exacerbated by the preference for dimerisation to occur between heparin activated β-antithrombin and latent antithrombin as opposed to α-antithrombin.

A form of antithrombin that is an intermediate in the conversion between native and latent forms of antithrombin has also been isolated and this has been termed prelatent antithrombin.

==Antiangiogenic antithrombin==
Angiogenesis is a physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Under normal physiological conditions angiogenesis is tightly regulated and is controlled by a balance of angiogenic stimulators and angiogenic inhibitors. Tumor growth is dependent upon angiogenesis and during tumor development a sustained production of angiogenic stimulatory factors is required along with a reduction in the quantity of angiogenic inhibitory factors tumor cells produce. The cleaved and latent form of antithrombin potently inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in animal models. The prelatent form of antithrombin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in-vitro but to date has not been tested in experimental animal models.

<doc id="511063" wikidata="Q7531755" url="?curid=511063" title="Site Finder">
<text>Site Finder was a wildcard DNS record for all .com and .net unregistered domain names, run by .com and .net top-level domain operator VeriSign between 15 September 2003 and 4 October 2003.

==Site Finder==
All Internet users who accessed any unregistered domains in the .com and .net domain space were redirected to a VeriSign web portal with information about VeriSign products and links to &quot;partner&quot; sites. This gave VeriSign the advantage of receiving greater revenue from advertising and from users wishing to register these domain names. It had the effect of capturing the web traffic for several million mistyped or experimental web accesses per day, and meant that VeriSign effectively owned all possible .com and .net domains that had not been bought by others, and could use them as an advertising platform.

VeriSign described the change as an attempt to improve the Web browsing experience for the naive user, without mentioning any use of the domain name system other than by browsers. VeriSign&#x27;s critics saw this claim as disingenuous. The change led to a dramatic increase in the amount of Internet traffic arriving at verisign.com. According to the web traffic measurement company Alexa, in the year prior to the change verisign.com was around the 2,500th most popular website. In the weeks following the change, the site came into the top 20 most popular sites, and reached the top 10 in the aftermath of the change and surrounding controversy.

==Issues and controversy== 
There was a storm of controversy among network operators and competing domain registrars, particularly on the influential NANOG and ICANN mailing lists, some of whom asserted:
* that the redirection was contrary to the proper operation of the DNS, ICANN policy, and the Internet architecture in general;
* that VeriSign breached its trust with the Internet community by using technical architecture for marketing purposes;
* that the redirection broke various RFCs and disrupted existing Internet services, such as email relay and filtering (spam filters were not able to detect the validity of domain names);
* that the redirection amounted to typosquatting where the unregistered domain being resolved is a spelling mistake for a famous registered domain;
* that VeriSign abused its technical control over the .com and .net domains by exerting a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly control;
* that VeriSign may have been in breach of its contracts for running the .com and .net domains;
* that the Site Finder service assumed that all DNS traffic was caused by Web clients, ignoring the fact that DNS is used by other applications such as networked printers, FTP software, and dedicated communications applications. If users of these applications accidentally entered a wrong host name, instead of a meaningful &quot;host not found&quot; error they would get a &quot;request timed out&quot; error, making it look like the server existed but is not responding. No statement by VeriSign in support of Site Finder even acknowledged the existence of DNS traffic not caused by Web clients, although they published implementation details which mentioned this traffic.
* that Site Finder contained an end-user license agreement which stated that the user accepts the terms by using the service—but since mistyping an address automatically caused the service to be used, users could not refuse to accept the terms.

Others were concerned that the Site Finder service was written entirely in English and therefore was not accessible by non-English readers.

The Internet Architecture Board composed a document detailing many of the technical arguments against registry-level wildcards; this was used by ICANN as part of its supporting arguments for its action.

==Fallout==
A number of workarounds were developed to locally disable the effects of Site Finder on a per-network basis. Most notably, the Internet Systems Consortium announced that it had produced a version of the BIND DNS software that could be configured by Internet service providers to filter out wildcard DNS from certain domains; this software was deployed by a number of ISPs.

On October 4, 2003, as a result of a strong letter from ICANN, VeriSign disabled Site Finder. However, VeriSign has made public statements that suggest that they may be considering whether they will change this decision in the future. On February 27, 2004, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN, claiming that ICANN had overstepped its authority. The claim regarded not only Site Finder, but also VeriSign&#x27;s much-criticised Wait Listing Service. The claim was dismissed in August 2004; parts of the lawsuit continued, and culminated in a March 1, 2006 settlement between VeriSign and ICANN which included &quot;a new registry agreement relating to the operation of the .COM registry.&quot;

On July 9, 2004, the ICANN &quot;Security and Stability Advisory Committee&quot; (SSAC) handed down its findings after an investigation on Site Finder. It found that the service should not be deployed before ICANN and/or appropriate engineering communities were offered the opportunity to review a proposed implementation, and that domain name registries that provide a service to third parties should phase out wildcard records if they are used.

<doc id="511068" wikidata="Q1156820" url="?curid=511068" title="Self-serving bias">
<text>A self-serving bias is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem, or the tendency to perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner. It is the belief that individuals tend to ascribe success to their own abilities and efforts, but ascribe failure to external factors. When individuals reject the validity of negative feedback, focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures, or take more credit for their group&#x27;s work than they give to other members, they are protecting their self-esteem from threat and injury. These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but they also serve the self&#x27;s need for esteem. For example, a student who attributes earning a good grade on an exam to their own intelligence and preparation but attributes earning a poor grade to the teacher&#x27;s poor teaching ability or unfair test questions might be exhibiting a self-serving bias. Studies have shown that similar attributions are made in various situations, such as the workplace, interpersonal relationships, sports, and consumer decisions.

Both motivational processes (i.e. self-enhancement, self-presentation) and cognitive processes (i.e. locus of control, self-esteem) influence the self-serving bias. There are both cross-cultural (i.e. individualistic and collectivistic culture differences) and special clinical population (i.e. depression) considerations within the bias. Much of the research on the self-serving bias has used participant self-reports of attribution based on experimental manipulation of task outcomes or in naturalistic situations. Some more modern research, however, has shifted focus to physiological manipulations, such as emotional inducement and neural activation, in an attempt to better understand the biological mechanisms that contribute to the self-serving bias.

==History==
The theory of self-serving biases first came to attention in the late 1960s to early 1970s. As research on this topic grew, some people had concerns about it. In 1971, a fear emerged that the hypothesis would prove to be incorrect, much like the perceptual defense hypothesis by Dixon. However, the theory now holds strong. When this theory was still being developed it was during the research of attribution bias. Fritz Heider found that in ambiguous situations people made attributions based on their own needs, in order to maintain a higher self-esteem and viewpoint. This specific tendency became what we now know as the self-serving bias. Miller and Ross conducted a study in 1975 that was one of the earliest to assess not only self-serving bias but also the attributions for successes and failures within this theory. They argued that the self-serving bias people create is rational and not dependent on one&#x27;s need for self-esteem. This means that if the outcome of an event is consistent with the person&#x27;s expectation, then they will attribute dispositional (internal) factors. On the other hand, if the outcome of the event does not match the person&#x27;s expectations, they will make situational attributions by blaming their surroundings instead of themselves.

==Methods==

===Laboratory testing===
Investigations of the self-serving bias in the laboratory differ depending on the experimental goals, but have basic fundamental aspects. Participants perform some task, often of intelligence, social sensitivity, teaching ability, or therapy skills. Participants may be asked to work alone, in pairs, or in groups. After task completion, participants are given randomized bogus feedback. Some studies employ emotion-induction mechanisms to investigate moderating effects on the self-serving bias. Finally, participants make attributions for the given outcomes. These attributions are assessed by the researchers to determine implications for the self-serving bias.

===Neural experimentation===
Some more modern testing employs neural imaging techniques to supplement the fundamental self-serving bias laboratory procedures. Neural correlates of the self-serving bias have been investigated by electroencephalography (EEG), as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These procedures allow for insight into brain area activity during exhibition of a self-serving bias, as well as a mechanism to differentiate brain activity between healthy and clinical populations.

===Naturalistic investigation===
Retrospective performance outcomes can be used in investigation of the self-serving bias. An example of this is reported company performance followed up by self-report of outcome attributions. These self-report attributions can then be used to assess how successes and failures are viewed by company employees and executives. This method can be used for numerous outcome variables to determine the presence or absence of the self-serving bias.

==Factors and variables==

===Motivation===
Two types of motivation affect the self-serving bias: self-enhancement and self-presentation. Self-enhancement aims to uphold self-worth; attributing successes internally and failures externally helps people in their self-enhancement. Self-presentation refers to the drive to convey a desired image to others and make self-serving attributions to manage impressions. For example, they claim personal responsibility for successes but not failures in an attempt to influence how others perceive them. Motivation works in conjunction with cognitive factors to produce personally satisfying and self-preserving attributions for outcomes.

===Locus of control===
Locus of control is one of the main influences of attribution style. Individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they have personal control over situations and that their actions matter. Those with an external locus of control believe that outside forces, chance, and luck determine situations and that their actions cannot change anything. Individuals with an external locus of control are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias following failure than those with an internal locus of control. The difference in attribution style between individuals with internal and external loci of control, however, is not as marked in successful outcomes, as individuals with both types attribution style have less need to defend their self-images in success. Airplane pilots with an internal locus of control were likely to exhibit a self-serving bias in regard to their skill and levels of safety.

===Gender===
Studies have shown a slight discrepancy in males&#x27; and females&#x27; use of the self-serving bias. In self-report surveys investigating partner interactions of romantic couples, men tended to attribute negative interactions to their partners more than women did. This is evidence that men may exhibit the self-serving bias more than women, although the study did not look at positive interaction attributions.

===Age===
Older adults have been shown to make more internal causal attributions for negative outcomes. Differential attribution style at different ages indicates that the self-serving bias may be less likely in older adults. These older adults who attributed negative outcomes to more internal factors also rated themselves to be in poorer health, so negative emotional factors may confound the found age effects.

===Culture===
There is evidence of cross-cultural differences in the tendency to exhibit the self-serving bias, particularly when considering individualistic (Western) versus collectivistic (non-Western) societies. Family and group goals are important in collectivistic cultures. In contrast, the individual goals and identity focused on in individualistic societies increases the need for people within those cultures to guard and boost their personal self-esteem. While differences have been shown, conflicting literature has cited similarity in causal attributions across both individual and collective cultures, specifically between Belgium, West Germany, South Korea, and England. Naturalistic observation and information comparing United States and Japanese companies outcome attributions shows that the meaning and psychological function of internal versus external attributions are similar across cultures but that the difference is in the strategy of attribution. No consensus has been reached on cross-culture influences on the self-serving bias, though some systematic differences do seem to be present, especially between Western and non-Western cultures. For example, a study conducted by Kudo and Numuzaki showed that the participants in the success condition provided more internal attributions than the participants in the failure condition even though past research has constantly shown that Japanese people do not tend to show a self-serving bias. Another study conducted by Hugten and Witteloostuijn displayed the results that student participants between the ages of 13 and 15 who mainly process feedback in a non-native English tend to show more self-serving bias than those who process feedback in their native Dutch language.

===Role===
Investigations of self-serving bias distinguish between the role of participants as the actor of a task or as the observer of someone else performing a task, relating closely to actor–observer asymmetry. Actors of a task exhibit the self-serving bias in their attributions to their own success or failure feedback, whereas observers do not make the same attributions about another person&#x27;s task outcome. Observers tend to be more objective in their tendency to ascribe internal or external attributions to other people&#x27;s outcomes. This may be due to the fact that the self-image of actors is challenged directly and therefore actors feel the need to protect their own self-image, but do not feel the same inclination to do so when the self-image of others is threatened.

===Self-esteem and emotion===
Emotions can influence feelings of self-esteem, which in turn alters the need to protect one&#x27;s self-identity. Individuals with higher self-esteem are thought to have more to protect in their self-image, and therefore exhibit the self-serving bias more often than those individuals with lower self-esteem. In a study, participants who were induced to feel the emotions of guilt or revulsion were less likely to make self-serving attributions for success and less likely to make self-protecting attributions for failure. Coleman concluded that the two emotions of guilt and revulsion lead to a drop in self-esteem, and thus a reduction in the use of the self-serving bias.

===Self-awareness and probability of improvement===

The relationship between individuals&#x27; awareness levels and perceived probability of improvement also influences the activation of the self-serving bias. Individuals with high self-awareness attribute failure internally when they perceive a high probability of improvement. However, they will engage in self-serving bias, attributing failure externally when they perceive a low probability of improvement. Individuals low in self-awareness will attribute failure externally regardless of their perceived probability of improvement.

==Real-world implications==

===Interpersonal relations===
Whether the self-serving bias is exhibited may depend on interpersonal closeness, relationships in a social context. When working in pairs to complete interdependent outcome tasks, relationally close pairs did not show a self-serving bias while relationally distant pairs did. A study on self-serving bias in relational context suggests this is due to the idea that close relationships place limits on an individual&#x27;s self enhancement tendencies. The individual becomes more modest, when in a close relationship, and is less likely to use that relationship for his or her own benefit. Understanding why partners refrain from the self-serving bias is still in question but can partially be explained by favorable impression those in close relationships have for one another. A similar result was shown when looking at pairs of friends and strangers. Pairs performed an interdependent outcomes creativity test and were then given a bogus pipeline for a success or failure outcome. Strangers exhibited the self-serving bias in responsibility attributions, but friends tended to make joint attributions for both success and failure. Researchers have taken this as evidence for &quot;boundaries on self-enhancement&quot;. In another study conducted in 2016, the implicit and explicit evaluation of 108 partners and exes as parents who were either married, separated or divorced was researched to investigate if the self-serving bias influenced them. Using two Implicit Association tests, one measuring Self vs Partner and the other measuring Self vs Ex, results showed that most of the time, men and women consider their exes or partners as less suitable parents which demonstrates the self-serving bias as they &quot;ascribe more easily successes to internal factors&quot; and failures towards their partners. Also, another result demonstrated that &quot;women revealed a higher self-serving bias than men on both implicit and explicit measures, but only toward exes and not toward current partners&quot; because they consider their exes as an out-group and their partners as an in-group.

===Workplace===
The self-serving bias can be found in several aspects of the workplace. Research shows that the self-serving bias is used to explain employment: being hired for a job is attributed to personal factors, whereas failure to obtain a job is attributed to external factors. Experimental investigation of the explanations for unemployment through asking participants to imagine particular job opportunities and likelihood of getting those jobs, however, did not show such a self-serving bias. Researchers claim that this may be due to the actor-observer role differences in the self-serving bias. Within the workplace, victims of serious occupational accidents tend to attribute their accidents to external factors, whereas their coworkers and management tend to attribute the accidents to the victims&#x27; own actions. Interpersonal dynamics of the self-serving bias in the previous section have implications for attributions for outcomes in the workplace. In an investigation of group dynamics, virtual group members had to complete a decision-making task via computer-mediated communication. Results showed that the self-serving bias was present in negative outcomes, and that greater interpersonal distance from group members increased blame for negative outcomes.

====Narcissism====
Studies revealed that narcissism was related to enhanced self-ratings of leadership, even when controlling for the Big Five traits. Another study showed that narcissism was related to enhanced leadership self-perceptions; indeed, whereas narcissism was significantly positively correlated with self-ratings of leadership, it was significantly negatively related to other ratings of leadership. This study also revealed that narcissism was related to more favorable self-ratings of workplace deviance and contextual performance compared to other (supervisor) ratings. Because narcissism broadly reflects strong self-admiration and behavioral tendencies which may not be viewed positively by others it is possible that narcissism influences self- and other perceptions differently, and insight into this possibility may be important given that differences in perceptions are the foundation for certain types of performance management and development practices.

===Classroom===
Studies in both lab and field settings have shown both teachers and students hold self-serving biases in regard to outcomes in the classroom. These attributions hold the potential for conflict between teacher and student since neither will take personal responsibility, as the student may blame the teacher while the teacher holds the student accountable. However, both teachers and students also reported being aware of the others&#x27; bias, which indicated there may be a feasible conflict resolution mechanism.

===Computer technology===
Computers have become an integral part of everyday life, and research has shown that individuals may subconsciously treat interactions with computers as they would treat a social situation. This finding combined with what is known about the self-serving bias in interpersonal relations indicates that consumers that use a computer to buy products will take personal credit for successful purchases but blame the computer for negative purchase experiences. It was also found, however, that consumers are more willing to attribute successful purchases to the computer and not ascribe blame to the computer for failed purchases if they have &quot;intimate self-disclosure&quot; with the computer, which Moon describes as revelation of personal information that makes the discloser feel vulnerable. Another reason is that people are so used to bad functionality, counterintuitive features, bugs, and sudden crashes of most contemporary software applications that they tend not to complain about computer problems. Instead, they believe it is their personal responsibility to predict possible issues and to find solutions to computer problems. This unique phenomenon has been recently observed in several human-computer interaction investigations.

===Sports===
Individuals have been shown to exhibit the self-serving bias in regard to sports outcomes. In one study, collegiate wrestlers at the Division I level made self-reported attributions of the outcomes in their preseason matches. Winners were more likely than losers to attribute the match outcome to internal causes. The researchers note that wrestling is a one-on-one sport and has clearly defined winners. Therefore, other sports of this nature may show similar results, but other team sports or sports with more ambiguous outcomes may not show the same pattern for the self-serving bias. In another study conducted in 1987, the research focused on comparing the self-serving attributions made by individuals who played single sports and those who played in teams. The study gathered 549 statements that were coded for attributional content from lone performers such as tennis and golf players and team performers such as baseball, football or basketball players. The results showed that &quot;lone performers made more self-serving attributions than team performers&quot; because their performance outcomes have a greater effect on their individual esteem unlike for group outcomes where it &quot;must often be distributed among all participants.&quot; To expand upon self-serving attributions made by team sports, a study conducted in 1980 coded &quot;newspaper accounts of baseball and football for attributional content.&quot; The coding of the newspaper accounts showed that there was a &quot;tendency to make internal attributions for success and external attributions for failure&quot; which supports the self-serving bias as about 75% of the attributions from winning teams were internal while about 55% of attributions from losing teams were internal.

===Depression===
Clinically depressed patients tend to show less of a self-serving bias than individuals in the general population. In a study exploring the effects of mood on the self-serving bias, the moods of participants were manipulated to be either positive or negative. Negative mood participants were less likely to attribute successful outcomes to the self than positive mood participants, attributing success to external factors. It has been suggested that the negative mood in depressed individuals as well as their self-focused attention explains why clinically depressed populations are less likely to exhibit the self-serving bias than normal populations.

===Impacts in negotiation===
Self-Serving bias is defined also by Kaplan et al. to individual&#x27;s preferences, which effects to his/her beliefs in an optimistic way. Kaplan et al. also defines, that SSB should be termed as ‘self-defeating’ phenomenon as it appears for persons, who does not give up. Furthermore, Kaplan et al. state, that specific type of self-serving bias is wishful thinking. This is typically present, when unpleasant surprise pops up in the negotiation, particularly when the opponent has made preparations carefully. Another example is well-known phenomenon from law-court and is commonly used also in law-based TV-series. We can say, that according to Kaplan et al.&#x27;s finding, that self-serving bias is playing a major role in negotiation context. There is an emotional effect to the negotiations and there seems to be a reflection between self-serving bias and emotions.

==Neural research outcomes==

===Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)===
The self-serving bias has been investigated by the fMRI method in normal populations. Attributions using the bias show activation in the dorsal striatum, which plays a role in motivated behavior, as well as in the dorsal anterior cingulate. In clinically depressed patients, there appear to be weaker connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and limbic areas of the brain, so this connection may play a role in self-serving attributions.

===Electroencephalography (EEG)===
In a study employing the EEG method of examining brain activation, participants were given bogus outcome feedback that indicated either success or failure and told to make attributions. Different from non-self-serving responses, self-serving responses did not show increased dorsomedial frontal cortex activity preceding attribution decisions. Such lack of brain activity implies that self-control, which is controlled by the dorsomedial frontal cortex, is not as prominent in self-serving attributions as non-self-serving ones.

<text>Baron Tollemache, of Helmingham Hall near Ipswich in the County of Suffolk, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Tollemache family&#x27;s surname and the title of the barony is pronounced .

==History==
The title was created in 1876 for John Tollemache, who had earlier represented Cheshire South and Cheshire West in the House of Commons as a Conservative. He was the son of Admiral of the Fleet John Halliday (who in 1821 assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Tollemache in lieu of Halliday), eldest son of Lady Jane Halliday, youngest daughter of Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart.

The first Baron was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He also sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Cheshire West. On the death of his grandson, the third Baron, this line of the family failed, and the title passed to the late Baron&#x27;s second cousin, the fourth Baron. He was the son of Major-General Edward Tollemache, son of the Hon. Hamilton James Tollemache, fourth son of the first Baron. , the title is held by the fourth Baron&#x27;s son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 1975. He was Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk from 2003 to 2014.

The actor Danny Dyer is distantly related to the family, through his 11-times great-grandmother, Anne Tollemache, which he discovered during an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;.

The family seat is Helmingham Hall, near Helmingham in Suffolk.

<doc id="511082" wikidata="Q887978" url="?curid=511082" title="Cyprian Bhekuzulu">
<text>Cyprian Bhekuzulu Nyangayezizwe kaSolomon (4 August 1924 – 17 September 1968) was the king of the Zulu nation from 1948 until his death at Nongoma in 1968. He succeeded his father, king Solomon kaDinuzulu, after a lengthy succession dispute with his elder sibling, Zacharia, which was eventually resolved in 1944. Zacharia left for Mtubatuba where he would raise 7 children with his wife Phumzile. Cyprian&#x27;s uncle, Arthur Mshiyeni kaDinuzulu, functioned as regent during both the succession dispute and Cyprian&#x27;s minority. 

Cyprian ascended the throne as a chief of uSuthu rather than a Paramount Chief until 1951 when he was recognised as such by the white minority government of South Africa. Even then, he was a social head with no real power. Not since 1879 has anyone been recognised as a head of the Zulu people with an exception of Cyprian&#x27;s uncle (acting Paramount Chief Mshiyeni) but even he was a regent. This title was granted to him because the government wanted to secure a Bantustan and not out of genuine care for the man or the Zulu people.

== Early years ==
Cyprian had an upbringing similar to those of other children in the Zulu Kingdom, herding cattle with his siblings and cousins, and one of those cousins was Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi who later became one of the prominent politicians in South Africa and Prime Minister to King Zwelithini (Cyprian&#x27;s son and successor). Cyprian&#x27;s father Solomon died in 1933 and there was no heir to immediately succeed him because of the princes’ minority, this led to Solomon&#x27;s full brother, Arthur Edward Mshiyeni, being appointed the regent.

== Succession and disputes ==
The late king, Solomon, did not appoint an heir and as a result a candidate had to be nominated once the princes reached maturity. The first of these candidates was Solomon&#x27;s eldest son, Victor Phikokwaziyo but there was a lot of dispute within the royal family on his candidature. Another candidate was Thandayiphi Absalom, the prince regent preferred candidate. His nomination, however, brought discontent amongst the Zulu people as the prince regent and the nominee were perceived as being too accommodating to the Apartheid regime. 
It is this growing unpopularity of the two princes that resulted in a legend that a true and rightful heir is yet to avail himself and consequently fueled Cyprian&#x27;s ambition to inherit the throne. A while back, there was a primary school book of which the writer names Cyprian as the heir. Although the copies were abruptly modified and the claim removed, it did leave Cyprian with a confidence that he was “nominated by the books” and he pursued this claim. The momentum built around the prince and within a few months he had enough following to make the government reconsider Thandayiphi&#x27;s candidacy. An inquiry was made into the succession issue by the government and in the end, Cyprian was accepted as the heir. His mother had managed to provide a signed letter by the late Chief stating that Cyprian is his heir; the letter was verified to be authentic by the technical experts.

== Death ==
Cyprian was succeeded by his son, king Goodwill Zwelethini kaBhekuzulu (d. 2021) and his daughter Princess Nomusa kaBhekuzulu (d. 2020) was Regent Queen to AmaRharhabe (sub-group of Xhosa) as Queen Noloyiso after the death of husband King Maxhob&#x27;ayakhawuleza Sandile in 2011.

<text>Wite-Out is a registered trademark for a brand of correction fluid, originally created for use with photocopies, and manufactured by the BIC corporation.

==History==

Wite-Out dates to 1966, when Edwin Johanknecht an insurance-company clerk, sought to address a problem he observed in correction fluid available at the time: a tendency to smudge ink on photostatic copies when it was applied. Johanknecht enlisted the help of his associate George Kloosterhouse, a basement waterproofer who experimented with chemicals, and together they developed their own correction fluid, introduced as &quot;Wite-Out WO-1 Erasing Liquid&quot;.

In 1971, they incorporated as Wite-Out Products, Inc. The trademark &quot;Wite-Out&quot; was registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 5, 1974. The application listed the date of &quot;first use in commerce&quot; as January 27, 1966.

Early forms of Wite-Out sold through 1981 were water-based and hence water-soluble. While this allowed simple cleaning, it also had the problem of long drying times. The formula also did not work well on non-photostatic media such as typewritten copy. 

The company was bought in 1981 by Archibald Douglas. Douglas, as chairman, led the company toward solvent-based formulas with faster drying times. Three different formulas were created, each optimized for different media. New problems arose: a separate bottle of thinner was required, and the solvent used was known to contribute to ozone depletion. The company addressed these problems in July 1990 with the introduction of a reformulated &quot;For Everything&quot; correction fluid.

The French corporation Société Bic acquired Wite-Out Products in 1992.

In 2017, sales of Wite-Out grew nearly 10 percent globally with &quot;AdWeek&quot; suggesting that the increase in sales was due to artists using the fluid as paint.

<doc id="511090" wikidata="Q331368" url="?curid=511090" title="Yat">
<text>Yat or jat (Ѣ ѣ; italics: &quot;Ѣ ѣ&quot;) is the thirty-second letter of the old Cyrillic alphabet. It is usually romanized as E with a haček: &quot;Ě ě&quot;.

There is also another version of yat, the iotated yat (majuscule: , minuscule: ), which is a Cyrillic character combining a decimal I and a yat. There was no numerical value for this letter and it was not in the Glagolitic alphabet. It was encoded in Unicode 5.1 at positions U+A652 and U+A653.

== Usage ==
Yat represented a Common Slavic long vowel, usually notated as . It is generally believed to have represented the sound or , like the pronunciation of in &quot;cat&quot; or in &quot;egg&quot;, which was a reflex of earlier Proto-Slavic * and *. That the sound represented by yat developed late in the history of Common Slavic is indicated by its role in the Slavic second palatalization of the Slavic velar consonants.

The Glagolitic alphabet contained only one letter for both yat and the Cyrillic iotated a . According to Kiril Mirchev, this meant that after in the Thessaloniki dialect (which served as a basis for Old Church Slavonic) mutated into a wide vowel that resembled or was the same as yat ().

To this day, the most archaic Bulgarian dialects, i.e., the Rup and Moesian dialects feature a similar phonetic change where after iota and the formerly palatal consonants (), () and () becomes , e.g. -&gt; (&quot;(I) was standing&quot;), -&gt; (&quot;drunkard&quot;), -&gt; (&quot;frogs&quot;), etc. Dialects that still feature this phonetic change include the Razlog dialect, the Smolyan dialect, the Hvoyna dialect, the Strandzha dialect, individual subdialects in the Thracian dialect, the Shumen dialect, etc.

This problem did not exist in the Cyrillic alphabet, which had two separate letters for yat and iotated a, and . Any subsequent mix-ups of yat and iotated a and/or other vowels in Middle Bulgarian manuscripts are owing to the ongoing transformation of the Bulgarian vowel and consonant system in the Late Middle Ages.

An extremely rare &quot;iotated yat&quot; form also exists, documented only in Svyatoslav&#x27;s Izbornik from 1073.

=== Standard reflexes ===
In various modern Slavic languages, yat has reflected into various vowels. For example, the Proto-Slavic root &quot;*bělъ&quot; &quot;white&quot; became:

* in Standard Russian (dialectal , or even in some regions) 
* in Ukrainian and Rusyn
* in Belarusian
* - in Bulgarian ( - in Western dialects) 
* in Macedonian 
* in the standard Serbian Ekavian variant of Serbo-Croatian (genitive )
* in Ikavian Serbo-Croatian
* in the standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian Ijekavian variants of Serbo-Croatian (genitive ) 
* in Slovenian
* in Polish 
* in Czech
* in Slovak.

===Other reflexes===
Other reflexes of yat exist; for example:
*Proto-Slavic &quot;telěga / телѣга&quot; became (; ѣ &gt; i reflex) in Serbo-Croatian.
*Proto-Slavic &quot;orěhъ / орѣхъ&quot; became (; ѣ &gt; a reflex) in Serbo-Croatian.

===Confusion with other letters===
Due to these reflexes, yat no longer represented an independent phoneme but an already existing one, represented by another Cyrillic letter. As a result, children had to memorize by rote whether or not to write yat. Therefore, the letter was dropped in a series of orthographic reforms: in Serbian with the reform of Vuk Karadžić, in Ukrainian-Ruthenian with the reform of Panteleimon Kulish, later in Russian and Belarusian with the Bolshevik reform in 1918, and in Bulgarian and Carpathian dialects of Ruthenian language as late as 1945.

The letter is no longer used in the standard modern orthography of any of the Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic script, but survives in Ukrainian (Ruthenian) liturgical and church texts of Church Slavonic in Ruthenian (Ukrainian) edition and in some written in the Russian recension of Church Slavonic. It has, since 1991, found some favor in advertising to deliberately invoke an archaic or &quot;old-timey&quot; style.

===Bulgarian===
The open articulation of yat (as or ) and the reflexes of Proto-Slavic *tj/*ktĭ/*gtĭ and *dj as () and () have traditionally been considered the two most distinctive phonetic features of Old Bulgarian. Based on
* the preserved articulation of yat as in the remote eastern Albanian villages of Boboshticë and Drenovë;
* preserved archaic Slavic toponyms in southern and eastern Albania, Thessaly and Epirus featuring &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;ea&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in yat&#x27;s etymological place, e.g., or (renamed Moschopotamos in 1926) from , &quot;cornel-tree&quot; (see also Dryanovo); (renamed :el:Λεπτοκαρυά Ιωαννίνων in 1927) from , &quot;hazel&quot; (see also Lyaskovets); Labovë e Kryqit and Labovë e Madhe from , &quot;bread&quot; (see also Hlyabovo), etc.;
* the consistent etymological use of at the Ohrid Literary School until the mid-1200s;
* the use of &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;ea&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in yat&#x27;s etymological place in a number of toponyms in a 1019 Greek-language charter by Byzantine emperor Basil II &quot;the Bulgar Slayer&quot; relating to the newly created Theme of Bulgaria, e.g., for (Prizren); for (Sofia); for (Prilep); for the medieval fortress of (Devol, now in eastern Albania); for the medieval fortress of (Prosek), etc.;
* the use of &quot;ea&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in yat&#x27;s etymological place in a number of local toponyms in the area of modern-day Strumica in a 1152 Greek-language charter by Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, relating to the Holy Mother of God monastery in Veljusa, e.g., for (), for , for , for ;
* the 16th-century Greek-Bulgarian lexicon from Bogatsko in southwestern Macedonia written in Greek letters, which featured &quot;ia&quot; in yat&#x27;s etymological place, e.g., , mliako (&quot;milk&quot;); , želiazo (&quot;iron&quot;); , viadro (&quot;pale&quot;); , vriateno (&quot;spindle&quot;); , poviasmo (&quot;distaff&quot;); , viaždi (&quot;eyebrows&quot;); , koliano (&quot;knee&quot;); , neviasta (&quot;bride&quot;), , riaka (&quot;river&quot;), , viater (&quot;wind&quot;), etc., indicating that the Kostur dialect was still yakavian at the time; etc. etc.
the entire areas of modern Bulgarian and Macedonian are assumed to have been ѣkavian/yakavian until the Late Middle Ages.

In addition to the replacement of with in a number of Old and Middle Bulgarian Cyrillic manuscripts—reflecting the mutation of iotated a into , the opposite process of mutation of yat into palatalised consonant + was also underway. The process affected primarily yat in stressed syllables followed by hard consonant, with multiple examples present in manuscripts from both West and East, e.g. the Grigorovich Prophetologion of the late 1100s (e.g., instead of , &quot;body&quot;), the Tarnovo Gospel of 1273 (e.g, instead of , &quot;them&quot;), the Strumitsa Apostle of the mid-1200s (e.g., instead of , &quot;all-wise&quot;), etc.

However, the most certain proof of yakavian pronunciation of —and another confirmation that currently Ekavian dialects used to be Yakavian in the Middle Ages—comes from the use of hardened consonant + &quot;a&quot; in yat&#x27;s etymological place. While individual examples of hardened () or () + can be found even in Old Bulgarian manuscripts, the mutation is most consistent after hardened () and () in Middle Bulgarian manuscripts. Thus, the Strumitsa Apostle, for example, features hosts of examples, e.g., instead of (&quot;whole&quot;, neutr. sing.), instead of (&quot;to kiss&quot;), instead of (&quot;chastely&quot;), instead of (&quot;hands&quot;, dual), etc. etc.

An opposite process of narrowing of yat into started in the west in the 1200s, with a first example of consistent replacement of with in Tsar Constantine Tikh&#x27;s Virgin Charter of the early 1260s. The Charter, which was written in Skopje, predates the first Ekavian Serbian document (dated to 1289) by 15–20 years, which refutes the nationalistic claims of Serbian linguists, e.g. Aleksandar Belić that Ekavism is a uniquely Serbian phenomenon and confirms, e.g., Nicolaas van Wijk&#x27;s theory that it is a native Western Bulgarian development.

Mirchev and Totomanova have linked the mutation of yat into to either consonant depalatalization in stressed syllables or to unstressed syllables. Thus, those Bulgarian dialects that retained their palatalized consonants remained Yakavian in stressed syllables, whereas those that lost them moved towards Ekavism; unstressed yat, in turn, became practically everywhere. This eventually led to the current dialectal division of Eastern South Slavic into Eastern Bulgarian Yakavian and Western Bulgarian and Macedonian Ekavian.

The different reflexes of yat define the so-called yat boundary (), which currently runs roughly from Nikopol on the Danube to Thessaloniki on the Aegean Sea. West of that isogloss, &quot;yat&quot; is always realized as . East of it, there are different types of yakavism. Standard Bulgarian&#x27;s alternation of yat between or in stressed syllable before a hard syllable/consonant and in all other cases is only characteristic of the Balkan dialects (cf. Maps no. 1 &amp; 2).

Examples of the alternation in the standard language (and the Balkan dialects) in the form (&quot;stressed, followed by hard consonant/syllable&quot;)→(&quot;stressed, followed by soft consonant/syllable&quot;)→(&quot;unstressed&quot;) follow below:

* (&quot;white&quot;, masc. sing.) [adj.] → (&quot;white&quot;, pl.) [adj.] → (&quot;whiteness&quot;) [n.] 
* (&quot;milk&quot;) [n.] → (&quot;milky&quot;) [adj.] → (&quot;milkman&quot;) [n.] 
* (&quot;foam&quot;) [n.] → (&quot;to foam&quot;) [v.] → (&quot;foamy&quot;) [adj.]
* (&quot;laughter&quot;) [n.] → (&quot;to laugh&quot;) [v.] → (&quot;laughable&quot;) [adj.]
* (&quot;(I) succeeded&quot;) [v.] → (&quot;successful&quot;) [adj.] → (&quot;success rate&quot;) [n.]
* (&quot;coast&quot;) [n.] → (&quot;coastal&quot;) [adj.] → (&quot;the coast&quot;) [n.]

The Moesian dialects in the northeast and the Rup dialects in the southeast feature a variety of other alternations, most commonly or in stressed syllable before hard consonant/syllable, in stressed syllable before soft consonant/syllable and in unstressed syllables (cf. Maps no. 1 &amp; 2). The open articulation as before hard consonant/syllable has survived only in isolated dialects, e.g., Banat Bulgarian and in clusters along the &quot;yat boundary&quot;. The open articulation as after hardened () survives as a remnant of former yakavism in a number of western Bulgarian and eastern Macedonian dialects (cf. Map no. 3).

As the yat boundary is only one of many isoglosses that divides the dialects of Eastern South Slavic into Western and Eastern, the term &quot;&quot;Yat Isogloss Belt&quot; has recently superseded the term &quot;yat boundary&quot;&quot;. The Belt unifies Yakavian and Ekavian dialects with mixed, Western and Eastern traits into a buffer zone that ensures a gradual transition between the two major dialect groups.

From the late 19th century until 1945, standard Bulgarian orthography did not reflect the and alternation and used the Cyrillic letter for both in yat&#x27;s etymological place. This was regarded as a way to maintain unity between Eastern and Western Bulgarians, as much of what was then seen as Western Bulgarian dialects was under foreign control. However, this also complicated orthography for a country that was generally Eastern-speaking. There were several attempts to restrict the use of the letter only to those word forms where there was a difference in pronunciation between Eastern and Western Bulgarian (e.g., in the failed orthographic reform of 1892 and in several proposals by professor Stefan Mladenov in the 1920s and 1930s), but the use of the letter remained largely etymological. In response, in the Interwar period, the Bulgarian Communist Party started referring to the letter as a manifestation of &quot;class elitism&quot; and &quot;Greater Bulgarian Chauvinism&quot; and made its elimination a top priority.

Consequently, after Bulgaria&#x27;s occupation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and the installation of a puppet government headed by the communists, was summarily thrown of the Bulgarian alphabet and the spelling changed to conform to the Eastern pronunciation by an orthographic reform in 1945 despite any objections. After 1989, the elimination of yat from the alphabet has generally been regarded as a violation of the unity of the Bulgarian language, in particular, in right-leaning circles, and nationalistic parties like VMRO-BND have campaigned, unsuccessfully, for its reintroduction.

Notably, the Macedonian Patriotic Organization, an organisation of Macedonian Bulgarian emigrants in North America, continued to use in the Bulgarian edition of newsletter, Macedonian Tribune, until it switched to an English-only version in the early 1990s.

===Russian===


In Russian, written confusion between the yat and appears in the earliest records; when exactly the distinction finally disappeared in speech is a topic of debate. Some scholars, for example W. K. Matthews, have placed the merger of the two sounds at the earliest historical phases (the 11th century or earlier), attributing its use until 1918 to Church Slavonic influence. Within Russia itself, however, a consensus has found its way into university textbooks of historical grammar (e.g., V. V. Ivanov), that, taking all the dialects into account, the sounds remained predominantly distinct until the 18th century, at least under stress, and are distinct to this day in some localities. Meanwhile, the yat in Ukrainian usually merged in sound with instead (see below).

The story of the letter yat and its elimination from the Russian alphabet makes for an interesting footnote in Russian cultural history. See Reforms of Russian orthography for details. A full list of words that were written with the letter yat at the beginning of 20th century can be found in the Russian Wikipedia.

A few inflections and common words were distinguished in spelling by / (for example: &quot;to eat&quot; / &quot;(there) is&quot;; &quot;I heal&quot; / &quot;I fly&quot;; , &quot;bluer&quot; / &quot;blue&quot; (n.); , &quot;knowledge&quot; / &quot;leadership&quot;).

The retention of the letter without discussion in the Petrine reform of the Russian alphabet of 1708 indicates that it then still marked a distinct sound in the Moscow &quot;koiné&quot; of the time. However, in 1748 an early proposal for partial revision of the usage of was made by Vasily Trediakovsky. The polymath Lomonosov in his 1755 grammar noted that the sound of was scarcely distinguishable from that of the letter , although he firmly defended their distinction in spelling. A century later (1878) the philologist Grot stated flatly in his standard &quot;Russian orthography&quot; (, ) that in the common language there was no difference whatsoever between their pronunciations. However, dialectal studies in the 20th century have shown that, in certain regional dialects, a phonemically distinct reflex of *ě has still been retained.
Some reflexes of have further evolved into , especially in inflected forms of words where have become stressed, while the dictionary form has it unstressed. One such example is &quot;star&quot; against &quot;stars&quot;. Some dictionaries used a &quot;yat&quot; with a diaeresis, , to denote this sound, in a similar fashion to the creation of the letter .

A proposal for spelling reform from the Russian Academy of Science in 1911 included, among other matters, the systematic elimination of the yat, but was declined at the highest level. According to Lev Uspensky&#x27;s popular linguistics book &quot;A Word on Words&quot; (), yat was &quot;the monster-letter, the scarecrow-letter ... which was washed with the tears of countless generations of Russian schoolchildren&quot;. The schoolchildren made use of mnemonic nonsense verses made up of words with :

The spelling reform was promulgated by the Provisional Government in the summer of 1917. However, it was not implemented under the prevailing conditions. After the Bolshevik Revolution, the new regime took up the Provisional Drafts, implementing them minor deviations. Orthography came to be viewed by many as an issue of politics, and the letter yat its primary symbol. Émigré Russians generally adhered to the old spelling until after World War II; long and impassioned essays were written in its defense, as by Ivan Ilyin in 1952 (, ). Even in the Soviet Union, it is said that some printing shops continued to use the eliminated letters until their blocks of type were forcibly removed; the Academy of Sciences published its annals in the old orthography until approximately 1924. The older spelling practice within Russia was ended through government pressure as well as by the large-scale campaign for literacy in 1920s and 1930s, conducted in accordance with the new norm.

According to the reform, yat was replaced by in most words, e.g. , became , ; for a small number of words it was replaced by instead, according to pronunciation: (&#x27;those&#x27;, feminine), (&#x27;one&#x27;, feminine plural), , , (declined forms of were replaced with , , , , .

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as a tendency occasionally to mimic the past appeared in Russia, the old spelling became fashionable in some brand names and the like, as archaisms, specifically as &quot;sensational spellings&quot;. For example, the name of the business newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; appears on its masthead with a word-final hard sign, which is superfluous in modern orthography: &quot;&quot;. Calls for the reintroduction of the old spelling were heard, though not taken seriously, as supporters of the yat described it as &quot;that most Russian of letters&quot;, and the &quot;white swan&quot; () of Russian spelling.

===Ukrainian===

In Ukrainian, yat has traditionally represented or . In modern Ukrainian orthography its reflexes are represented by or . As Ukrainian philologist Volodymyr Hlushchenko notes that initially in proto-Ukrainian tongues yat used to represent or which around 13th century transitioned into . Yet, in some phonetic Ukrainian orthographies from the 19th century, it was used to represent both or as well as . This corresponds more with the Russian pronunciation of yat rather than actual word etymologies. Return to or pronunciation was initiated by the Pavlovsky &quot;Grammar of the Little Russian dialect&quot; (1818) according to Hryhoriy Pivtorak. While in the same &quot;Grammar&quot; Pavlovsky states that among Little Russians &quot;yat&quot; is pronounced as (Ѣ произносится какъ Россїйское мягкое j. на пр: ні́жный, лі́то, слідъ, тінь, сі́но.). The modern Ukrainian letter has the same phonetic function. Several Ukrainian orthographies with the different ways of using yat and without yat co-existed in the same time during the 19th century, and most of them were discarded before the 20th century. After the middle of the 19th century, orthographies without yat dominated in the Eastern part of Ukraine, and after the end of the 19th century they dominated in Galicia. However, in 1876–1905 the only Russian officially legalized orthography in the Eastern Ukraine was based on Russian phonetic system (with yat for ) and in the Western Ukraine (mostly in Carpathian Ruthenia) orthography with yat for was used before 1945; in the rest of the western Ukraine (not subjected to the limitations made by the Russian Empire) the so-called &quot;orthographic wars&quot; ended up in receiving a uniformed phonetic system which replaced yat with either or (it was used officially for Ukrainian language in the Austrian Empire).

&#x27;New yat&#x27; is a reflex of (which merged with yat in Ukrainian) in closed syllables. New yat is not related to the Proto-Slavic yat, but it has frequently been represented by the same sign. Using yat instead of in this position was a common after the 12th century. With the later phonological evolution of Ukrainian, both yat and new yat evolved into or . Some other sounds also evolved to the sound so that some Ukrainian texts from between the 17th and 19th centuries used the same letter ( or yat) uniformly rather than variation between yat, new yat, , and reflex of in closed syllables, but using yat to unify all i-sounded vowels was less common, and so &#x27;new yat&#x27; usually means letter yat in the place of i-sounded only. In some etymology-based orthography systems of the 19th century, yat was represented by and new yat was replaced with ( with circumflex). At this same time, the Ukrainian writing system replaced yat and new yat by or .

===Rusyn===
In Rusyn, yat was used until 1945. In modern times, some Rusyn writers and poets try to reinstate it, but this initiative is not really popular among Rusyn intelligentsia.

===Romanian===
In the old Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, the yat, called , was used as the diphthong. It disappeared when Romanian adopted the transitional alphabet, first in Wallachia, then in Moldavia.

===Serbo-Croatian===
The Old Serbo-Croatian &quot;yat&quot; phoneme is assumed to have a phonetic value articulatory between the vowels and . In the Štokavian and Čakavian vowel systems, this phoneme lost a back vowel parallel; the tendency towards articulatory symmetry led to its merging with other phonemes.

On the other hand, most Kajkavian dialects did have a back vowel parallel (a reflex of *ǫ and *l̥), and both the front and back vowels were retained in most of these dialects&#x27; vowel system before merging with a reflex of a vocalized Yer (*ь). Thus the Kajkavian vowel system has a symmetry between front and back closed vocalic phonemes: */ẹ/ (&lt; */ě/, */ь/) and */ọ/ (&lt; */ǫ/, */l̥/).

Čakavian dialects utilized both possibilities of establishing symmetry of vowels by developing Ikavian and Ekavian reflexes, as well as &quot;guarding the old yat&quot; at northern borders (Buzet dialect). According to yat reflex Čakavian dialects are divided to Ikavian (mostly South Čakavian), Ekavian (North Čakavian) and mixed Ikavian-Ekavian (Middle Čakavian), in which mixed Ikavian-Ekavian reflex is conditioned by following phonemes according to Jakubinskij&#x27;s law (e.g. : &lt; PSl. *slědъ : *slěditi; : &lt; *dělъ : *děliti). Mixed Ikavian-Ekavian Čakavian dialects have been heavily influenced by analogy (influence of nominative form on oblique cases, infinitive on other verbal forms, word stem onto derivations etc.). The only exception among Čakavian dialects is Lastovo island and the village of Janjina, with Jekavian reflex of yat.

The most complex development of yat has occurred in Štokavian, namely Ijekavian Štokavian dialects which are used as a dialectal basis for modern standard Serbo-Croatian variants, and that makes the reflexes of yat one of the central issues of Serbo-Croatian orthoepy and orthography. In most Croatian Štokavian dialects yat has yielded diphthongal sequence of in long and short syllables. The position of this diphthong is equally unstable as that of closed *, which has led to its dephonologization. Short diphthong has thus turned to diphonemic sequence , and long to disyllabic (triphonemic) , but that outcome is not the only one in Štokavian dialects, so the pronunciation of long yat in Neo-Štokavian dialects can be both monosyllabic (diphthongal or triphthongal) and disyllabic (triphonemic). However, that process has been completed in dialects which serve as a dialectal basis for the orthographical codification of Ijekavian Serbo-Croatian. In writing, the diphthong is represented by the trigraph – this particular inconsistency being a remnant of the late 19th century codification efforts, which planned to redesign common standard language for Croats and Serbs. This culminated in the Novi Sad agreement and &quot;common&quot; orthography and dictionary. Digraphic spelling of a diphthong as e.g. was used by some 19th-century Croat writers who promoted so-called &quot;etymological orthography&quot; – in fact morpho-phonemic orthography which was advocated by some Croatian philological schools of the time (Zagreb philological school), and which was even official during the brief period of the fascist Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945). In standard Croatian, although standard orthography is for long yat, standard pronunciation is . Serbian has two standards: Ijekavian is for long yat and Ekavian which uses for short and for long yat.

Standard Bosnian and Montenegrin use for short and for long yat.

Dephonologization of diphthongal yat reflex could also be caused by assimilation within diphthong itself: if the first part of a diphthong assimilates secondary part, so-called &quot;secondary Ikavian reflex&quot; develops; and if the second part of a diphthong assimilates the first part &quot;secondary Ekavian reflex&quot; develops. Most Štokavian Ikavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian are exactly such – secondary Ikavian dialects, and from Ekavian dialects secondary are the Štokavian Ekavian dialects of Slavonian Podravina and most of Serbia. They have a common origin with Ijekavian Štokavian dialects in a sense of developing yat reflex as diphthongal reflex. Some dialects also &quot;guard&quot; older yat sound, and some reflexes are probably direct from yat.

Direct Ikavian, Ekavian and mixed reflexes of yat in Čakavian dialects are a much older phenomenon, which has some traces in written monuments and is estimated to have been completed in the 13th century. The practice of using old yat phoneme in Glagolitic and Bosnian Cyrillic writings in which Serbo-Croatian was written in the centuries that followed was a consequence of conservative scribe tradition. Croatian linguists also speak of two Štokavians, Western Štokavian (also called Šćakavian) which retained yat longer, and Eastern Štokavian which &quot;lost&quot; yat sooner, probably under (western) Bulgarian influences.
Areas which bordered Kajkavian dialects mostly retained yat, areas which bordered Čakavian dialects mostly had secondary Ikavisation, and areas which bordered (western) Bulgarian dialects mostly had secondary Ekavisation. &quot;Core&quot; areas remained Ijekavian, although western part of the &quot;core&quot; became monosyllabic for old long yat.

Reflexes of yat in Ijekavian dialects are from the very start dependent on syllable quantity. As it has already been said, standard Ijekavian Serbo-Croatian writes trigraph at the place of old long yat, which is in standard pronunciation manifested disyllabically (within Croatian standard monosyllabic pronunciation), and writes at the place of short yat. E.g. &lt; PSl. *bělъ, &lt; *mlěko &lt; by liquid metathesis from *melkò, &lt; *brěgъ &lt; by liquid metathesis from *bȇrgъ, but &lt; *mě̀sto, &lt; *vě̀ra, &lt; *mě̀ra. There are however some limitations; in front of and (&lt; word-final ) yat has a reflex of short . In scenarios when is not substituted by , i.e. not word-finally (which is a common Štokavian isogloss), yat reflex is also different. E.g. &lt; *grějati, &lt; *sějati, &lt; *bějaše; but : &lt; *htělъ : *htěla, : (&lt; *letělъ : *letěla). The standard language also allows some doublets to coexist, e.g. and &lt; *cě̑lъ, and &lt; *bě́lъ.

Short yat has reflexes of and behind in consonant clusters, e.g. and , and , and , etc.

If short syllable with yat in the word stem lengthens due to the phonetic or morphological conditions, reflex of is preserved, e.g. – , – .

In modern standard Ijekavian Serbo-Croatian varieties syllables that carry yat reflexes are recognized by alternations in various inflected forms of the same word or in different words derived from the same stem. These alternating sequences are dependent on syllable quantity. Beside modern reflexes they also encompass apophonic alternations inherited from Proto-Slavic and Indo-European times, which were also conditioned by quantitative alternations of root syllable, e.g. – , – etc. These alternations also show the difference between the diphthongal syllables with Ijekavian reflex of yat and syllables with primary phonemic sequence of , which has nothing to do with yat and which never shows alternation in inflected forms, e.g. , etc.

<doc id="511091" wikidata="Q11089636" url="?curid=511091" title="Dipstick">
<text>A dipstick is one of several measurement devices.

Some dipsticks are dipped into a liquid to perform a chemical test or to provide a measure of quantity of the liquid.

Since the late 20th century, a flatness/levelness measuring device trademarked &quot;Dipstick&quot; has been used to produce concrete and pavement surface profiles and to help establish profile measurement standards in the concrete floor and paving industries.

== Testing dipstick ==

A testing dipstick is usually made of paper or cardboard and is impregnated with reagents that indicate some feature of the liquid by changing color. In medicine, dipsticks can be used to test for a variety of liquids for the presence of a given substance, known as an analyte. For example, urine dipsticks are used to test urine samples for haemoglobin, nitrite (produced by bacteria in a urinary tract infection), protein, nitrocellulose, glucose and occasionally urobilinogen or ketones.

They are usually brightly coloured, and extremely rough to the touch.

== Measuring dipstick ==

Dipsticks can also be used to measure the quantity of liquid in an otherwise inaccessible space, by inserting and removing the stick and then checking the extent of it covered by the liquid. The most familiar example is the oil level dipstick found on most internal combustion engines.

Other kinds of dipsticks are used to measure everything from fuel levels to the amount of beer left in an ale cask (Firkin).

==Floor &amp; pavement profiler==

&quot;Dipstick&quot; is the trade name of a profiling device manufactured by Face Construction Technologies of Norfolk, Virginia USA. The instrument is used in 66 countries on six continents to measure the flatness and levelness of concrete floor slabs and pavements.

The Dipstick measures concrete floor slab flatness/levelness in terms of Face Floor Profile Numbers (&quot;F-Numbers&quot;), a profile measurement system adopted in 1990 by the American Concrete Institute. The Dipstick is &#x27;walked&#x27; across sections of the floor between two successive points and data is collated. This is now regarded by some in the industry as a long slow process with other profiling devices available offering accurate results in less time. The Dipstick can have a variable sampling rate from 75mm up to 300mm.

F-Number measurement procedures were established by ASTM Standard E1155. The instrument also measures TR-34 Free Movement (FM); TR-34 Defined Movement (DM); Gap under Sliding Unleveled Straightedge; Gap under Rolling Straightedge; and DIN 18202.

The U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the World Bank (with its International Roughness Index... or &quot;IRI&quot;) have established measurement procedures using Dipstick profiler data.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has established its Standard R 41 (most recently published as R 41-05 (2010)) to, &quot;... manually collect precision profile data utilizing the Face Technologies Dipstick. The instrument measures profiles (relative elevation differences) at a rate and accuracy greater than traditional rod and level surveys. Procedures for measuring both longitudinal and transverse profiles are described.&quot;

The Dipstick, with a reported accuracy of .01 mm ( 0.0004 inches), measures &quot;true&quot; profiles and is the most widely used and accepted Class 1 profiler for the purposes of calibrating other profilers. Although, most state DOTs now use rolling inclinometer based systems for AASHTO r56 certification procedures which collect at the same 25mm sampling interval as highway profilers.

Dipstick was used to obtain data that were used as ground truth in FHWA evaluations of the repeatability of IRI values as measured by other profilers and in Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTTP) studies conducted by several states.

The instrument was similarly used to produce reference measurements by the World Road Association (PIARC) in its 1998 &quot;International Experiment to Harmonise Longitudinal and Transverse Profile Measurement and Reporting Procedures.&quot; The PIARC experiment was conducted in the US, Japan, Holland and Germany and included IRI values from airport runways and super highways to rough unpaved roads.

<doc id="511094" wikidata="Q1155838" url="?curid=511094" title="Correspondent">
<text>A correspondent or on-the-scene reporter is usually a journalist or commentator for a magazine, or an agent who contributes reports to a newspaper, or radio or television news, or another type of company, from a remote, often distant, location. A foreign correspondent is stationed in a foreign country. The term &quot;correspondent&quot; refers to the original practice of filing news reports via postal letter. The largest networks of correspondents belong to ARD (Germany) and BBC (UK).

==Vs. reporter==

In Britain, the term &#x27;correspondent&#x27; usually refers to someone with a specific specialist area, such as health correspondent. A &#x27;reporter&#x27; is usually someone without such expertise who is allocated stories by the newsdesk on any story in the news. A &#x27;correspondent&#x27; can sometimes have direct executive powers, for example a &#x27;Local Correspondent&#x27; (voluntary) of the Open Spaces Society (founded 1865) has some delegated powers to speak for the Society on path and commons matters in their area including representing the Society at Public Inquiries.

==Common types of correspondents==

===Capitol correspondent===
A capitol correspondent is a correspondent who reports from headquarters of government.

===Legal/justice correspondent===
A legal or justice correspondent reports on issues involving legal or criminal justice topics, and may often report from the vicinity of a courthouse. 

===Red carpet correspondent===
A red carpet correspondent is an entertainment reporter who reports from the red carpet of an entertainment or media event, such as a premiere, award ceremony or festival.

===Foreign correspondent===
A foreign correspondent is any individual who reports from primarily foreign locations.

====War correspondent====
A war correspondent is a foreign correspondent who covers stories first-hand from a war zone.

====Foreign bureau====
A foreign bureau is a news bureau set up to support a news gathering operation in a foreign country.

===Cost of living correspondent===
Cost of living correspondents have been employed by several news agencies in the light of the &quot;cost of living&quot; crisis in the United Kingdom from 2021 onwards.

==On-the-scene TV news==
In TV news, a &quot;live on-the-scene&quot; reporter reports from the field during a &quot;live shot&quot;. This has become an extremely popular format with the advent of Eyewitness News.

A recent cost-saving measure is for local TV news to dispense with out-of-town reporters and replace them with syndicated correspondents, usually supplied by a centralized news reporting agency. The producers of the show schedule time with the correspondent, who then appears &quot;live&quot; to file a report and chat with the hosts. The reporter will go and do a number of similar reports for other stations. Many viewers may be unaware that the reporter does not work directly for the news show. This is also a popular way to report the weather. For example, AccuWeather does not just supply data, they also supply on-air meteorologists from television studios at their headquarters.

<doc id="511096" wikidata="Q725233" url="?curid=511096" title="Bjarni Tryggvason">
<text>Bjarni Valdimar Tryggvason (September 21, 1945 – April 5, 2022) was an Icelandic-born Canadian engineer and a NRC/CSA astronaut. He served as a Payload Specialist on Space Shuttle mission STS-85 in 1997, a nearly 12-day mission to study changes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Bjarni is the first, and , only Canadian astronaut of Icelandic birth.

== Early life ==
Tryggvason was born in Reykjavík, Iceland, on September 21, 1945. He moved to Canada with his parents when he was eight years old, and grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia. After attending high school in Richmond, British Columbia, he obtained a B.A.Sc. degree in engineering physics from the University of British Columbia in 1972, and subsequently studied at the postgraduate level in engineering with specialization in applied mathematics and fluid dynamics at the University of Western Ontario.

== Academic career ==
Tryggvason worked as a meteorologist with the cloud physics group at the Atmospheric Environment Service in Toronto in 1972 and 1973. In 1974, he joined the University of Western Ontario to work as a research associate at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory working on projects involving rigid and aero-elastic model studies of wind effects on structures. In 1987, he was a guest research associate at Kyoto University, Japan. This was followed by a similar position at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. In late 1979, he returned to the University of Western Ontario as a lecturer in applied mathematics.

In 1982, Tryggvason joined the Low Speed Aerodynamics Laboratory at the National Research Council (NRC) in Ottawa. He became part of the NRC team assembled to study the sinking of the &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; oil rig in support of the Royal Commission investigation. He designed and led the aerodynamics tests, which established the wind loads acting on the rig. Between 1981 and 1992, he was also a part-time lecturer at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University, teaching graduate courses on structural dynamics and random vibrations.

Tryggvason had about 4,000 hours of flight experience, held an Airline Transport Rating and had experience as a flight instructor. He was active in aerobatic flight and once qualified as captain in the Tutor jet trainer with the Royal Canadian Air Force.

== CSA career ==
Tryggvason was one of the six Canadian astronauts selected in December 1983, and was the first Canadian astronaut born in Iceland. He was back-up Payload Specialist to Steven MacLean for the CANEX-2 set of experiments which flew on Mission STS-52, October 22 to November 1, 1992. He was the Project Engineer for the design of the SVS target spacecraft which was deployed during that mission.

He was the principal investigator in the development of the Large Motion Isolation Mount, which has flown numerous times on the NASA Boeing KC-135 and DC-9 aircraft, for the Microgravity vibration Isolation Mount (MIM), which operated on the Russian Mir space station from April 1996 until January 1998, and for the MIM-2, which flew on STS-85 in August 1997. The MIM was used on the Mir to support several Canadian and US experiments in material science and fluid physics.

Tryggvason served as a payload specialist on STS-85 (August 7–19, 1997), a 12-day mission to study changes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. During the flight, his primary role was testing MIM-2 and performing fluid dynamics experiments designed to examine sensitivity to spacecraft vibrations. This work was directed at developing better understanding of the need for systems such as the MIM on the International Space Station (ISS) and on the effect of vibrations on the many experiments to be performed on the ISS. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, traveling 4.7 million miles in 284 hours and 28 minutes.

In August 1998, Tryggvason became part of NASA Astronaut Group 17. Training consisted of two years of physical and academic training relating to future missions. The class was the first group of astronauts to be trained as both mission specialist for the Space Shuttle and as potential crewmembers for the ISS. He was initially assigned as a Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) crew representative. SAIL is used to test, check out, and verify Shuttle flight software prior to use. He also supported integrated simulations on the ISS Training Facility. This facility is used for ISS crew training as well as in support of training the ISS Mission Control team.

== Post-CSA career ==
Tryggvason retired from the Canadian Space Agency in June 2008. He returned to teaching at the University of Western Ontario. He also taught at the International Test Pilots School in London, Ontario, and continued to serve as a test pilot.

On February 22, 2009, Tryggvason piloted a replica of Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s Silver Dart, from the ice on Baddeck Bay, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The flight commemorated the centennial of the first flight in Canada and the British Empire. Due to poor weather conditions expected on the next day, the flight occurred one day before the actual centenary of the original Silver Dart&#x27;s flight.

==Personal life and death==
Tryggvason had two children. His son also went into aviation as a commercial pilot, while his daughter was a veterinarian. He died on April 5, 2022, at the age of 76.

==Honors and affiliations==

Tryggvason was a member of the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute. He was awarded an honorary D.Sc. degree from the University of Western Ontario in 1998, an honorary Dr. Techn. degree from the University of Iceland in 2000, and an honorary D.Eng. degree from the University of Victoria in 2005. He was furthermore awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal in 1997, the Innovators Award of the Canadian Space Agency in 2004, and the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Icelandic Order of the Falcon in 2000.

<doc id="511100" wikidata="Q5176561" url="?curid=511100" title="Council on Environmental Quality">
<text>The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is a division of the Executive Office of the President that coordinates federal environmental efforts in the United States and works closely with agencies and other White House offices on the development of environmental and energy policies and initiatives.

==Mission==
The CEQ produces an annual report for the president on the state of the environment, oversees federal agency implementation of environmental impact assessments, and acts as a referee when agencies disagree over the adequacy of such assessments. The National Environmental Policy Act tasks CEQ with ensuring that federal agencies meet their obligations under the Act, granting the body a significant role in environmental protection. Through inter-agency working groups and coordination with other EOP bodies, CEQ also works to advance the president&#x27;s agenda on the environment, natural resources, and energy.

==History==
===Origins===
The United States Congress established the CEQ within the Executive Office of the President as part of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), during the Richard Nixon administration. The CEQ was assigned additional responsibilities by the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970. In enacting NEPA, Congress recognized that nearly all federal activities affect the environment in some way, and mandated that federal agencies must consider the environmental effects of their actions during their planning and decision-making processes. Under NEPA, CEQ works to balance environmental, economic, and social objectives in pursuit of NEPA&#x27;s goal of &quot;productive harmony&quot; between humans and their environment.

===Clinton administration===
President Bill Clinton appointed Kathleen McGinty and then George T. Frampton Jr. to chair the agency. Clinton started his administration in 1993 with an announcement that CEQ would be &quot;replaced&quot; with a new White House Office on Environmental Policy with McGinty as director before later merging that office back into CEQ with McGinty formally nominated as chair.

===George W. Bush administration===
President George W. Bush&#x27;s CEQ chairman was James L. Connaughton, serving from 2001 to 2009. He was formerly a partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he lobbied to reduce government regulation on behalf of clients including the Aluminum Company of America and the Chemical Manufacturers Association of America.

During the Bush administration, there were concerns over links between CEQ staffers and the industries it oversaw. BBC Environment Analyst Roger Harrabin described it as &quot;a hard-line group of advisers with close links to the U.S. oil industry.&quot; One CEQ chief of staff under President Bush, Philip Cooney, was previously a lobbyist employed by the American Petroleum Institute. In June 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an internal CEQ memo provided by federal whistleblower Rick Piltz. The memo showed Cooney had repeatedly edited government climate reports in order to play down links between emissions and global warming. Cooney, who claimed he had been planning to resign for two years, resigned two days after the scandal broke &quot;to spend more time with his family.&quot; Immediately after resigning, Cooney went to work for ExxonMobil in their public affairs department. In 2005 Piltz created a watchdog organization Climate Science Watch, a program of the Government Accountability Project.

===Obama administration===
Under President Barack Obama, Nancy Sutley served as Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality from January 2009 until February 2014. Following Sutley&#x27;s departure, Michael Boots served as acting head of the Council until March 2015. Christy Goldfuss was appointed to succeed Boots, and served in the same capacity, as &quot;managing director&quot;, until the end of Obama&#x27;s term, in January 2017.

===First Trump administration===
In October 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White—former chair of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality—to be chair of the CEQ. However, her nomination was withdrawn in February 2018 as she did not garner enough support in the Senate. CEQ chief of staff and acting head Mary Neumayr was nominated and considered in summer 2018 as chair. She was confirmed in January 2019.

===Biden administration===
In December 2020, president-elect Joe Biden nominated Brenda Mallory—then-director of regulatory policy at the Southern Environmental Law Center, and general counsel of the CEQ during the Obama administration—to serve as chair of the CEQ. Mallory was confirmed by the Senate on April 14, 2021, becoming the first African American chair of the CEQ. 
Mallory took part in the virtual 2021 Leaders&#x27; Climate Summit.

In November 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in &quot;Marin Audubon Society v. FAA&quot; that the CEQ does not have the authority to create binding regulations under the National Environmental Policy Act.

==Chair==
The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality serves as the principal environmental policy adviser to the US President. In addition, CEQ reports annually to the President on the state of the environment; oversees federal agency implementation of the environmental impact assessment process; and acts as a referee when agencies disagree over the adequacy of such assessments. The Council coordinates federal environmental efforts and works closely with agencies and other White House offices in the development of environmental policies and initiatives.

<text>Baron Tennyson, of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1884 for the poet Alfred Tennyson. His son, the second Baron, served as Governor-General of Australia, and his grandson, the third Baron, as a captain for the English cricket team.

The title was inherited by the late Baron&#x27;s second cousin once removed, the sixth and present holder of the peerage. He is the great-grandson of Hon. Lionel Tennyson, second son of the first Baron.

Another member of the Tennyson family was the naval architect Sir Eustace Tennyson-d&#x27;Eyncourt, 1st Baronet. He was the grandson of Charles Tennyson-d&#x27;Eyncourt, uncle of the first Baron Tennyson.

<doc id="511106" wikidata="Q348593" url="?curid=511106" title="Hisham I of Córdoba">
<text>Hisham I Al-Reda ibn Abd ar-Rahman () was the second Emir of Cordoba, ruling from 788 to 796 in al-Andalus.

Hisham was born April 26, 757 in Cordoba. He was the first son of Abd al-Rahman I (r. 756-788) and his wife, Halul, and the younger half brother of Suleiman.

==Domestic rebellions==
At the beginning of his reign, in 788, he faced rebellions from his brothers, Suleiman and &#x27;Abd Allah.
==Expedition to Septimania== 

Faced with Carolingian penetration south across the western and eastern Pyrenees, in 793 he called a &quot;jihad&quot; against the Christian Franks, sent over troops to Girona and Narbonne, but those strongholds stood firm. The Umayyad general Abd al-Malik ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mughith was more fortunate on his approach to Carcassonne, where he defeated Louis the Pious&#x27; Carolingian mentor William of Orange. However, surprisingly, the expedition did not advance deeper into Carolingian territory, but resulted in hefty loot and numerous slaves, which in turn provided the funds to expand the Great Mosque of Cordoba and build many mosques.

==Expeditions against Asturians and Basques==
As of 794, his generals, the above-mentioned Abd al-Malik and his brother Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mughith, campaigned every year of his reign against the northern principalities, namely Álava, Old Castile, and Asturias, deep into the last&#x27;s newly established capital city of Oviedo (794). The city in turn was sacked. Alfonso II of Asturias fled, and initiated contacts with Charlemagne. These expeditions didn&#x27;t aim to destroy the northern Christian principalities, but seem to have been a goal in themselves, raids for the purpose of amassing loot and re-asserting Cordovan military superiority over both restive local Andalusian garrisons and lords prone to detachment, the Kingdom of Asturias, and the Basques.

==Death and assessment==
Hisham died in 796 C.E. at the age of forty, after a rule of eight years. He was a prototype of Umar II, and strove to establish the Islamic way of life, living simply and avoiding ostentation. He was a God-fearing man and was known for his impartial justice and sound administration. After his death, &#x27;Abd Allah returned from exile and claimed Valencia and Suleiman claimed Tangiers against Hisham&#x27;s son, al-Hakam I.

Hisham was dubbed “the just.”

Hisham was a model of righteousness and a loyal prince. He lived in hopes of salvation and at the time of his succession to the throne, he believed, on the basis of his horoscope, that he had just eight years to live. He, therefore, abandoned all earthly enjoyments and sought redemption through charitable giving. He wore the simplest clothes, he would walk alone through the roads of Cordova, mingle with the ordinary people, visit the sick, enter the dwellings of the poor, and with genuine concern showed interest in all of their needs, requests, and complaints. At night, even in the pouring rain, he would take food from his palace and bring it to the poor. He was prompt in his religious duties, he urged his subjects to follow his example, and on rainy nights would dispense his wealth to those taking part in evening services at the mosques. After eight years, Hisham died as predicted and left to his successor a respectable kingdom.

<text>Fathers 4 Justice (or F4J) is a fathers&#x27; rights organisation in the United Kingdom. Founded in 2003, the group aims to gain public and parliamentary support for changes in UK legislation on fathers&#x27; rights mainly by staging stunts and protests, often conducted in costume.

==History==
F4J was founded in the UK by Matt O&#x27;Connor, a marketing consultant. He is the sole shareholder and a director of Fathers For Justice Limited.

==Activities==
=== 2003 ===
On 21 October 2003, campaigners Eddie &quot;Goldtooth&quot; Gorecki and Jonathan &quot;Jolly&quot; Stanesby scaled the Royal Courts of Justice in London while dressed respectively as Batman and Robin. The following day, the group&#x27;s members protested through London in a military tank in support of Goreckwi and Stanesby. Nine days later, David Chick climbed a crane near Tower Bridge while dressed as Spider-Man. The Metropolitan Police subsequently set up a cordon around the area that disrupted traffic through some of East London for several days. Chick was later cleared of criminal charges.

=== 2004 ===
In 2004, Stanesby carried out a &quot;citizen&#x27;s arrest&quot; of the then-Minister of State for Children Margaret Hodge at a conference, handcuffing himself to her and stating: &quot;Margaret Hodge, I&#x27;m arresting you for covering up child abuse.&quot; Both Stanseby and Jason Hatch (who had also attempted to handcuff himself to Hodge) were later cleared of false imprisonment charges by a jury.

On 19 May 2004, an alert was caused when two members of the group threw purple flour bombs at Tony Blair during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions at the House of Commons. Charged with public order offences, activist Guy Harrison was fined £600, and Ron Davis given a conditional discharge. Following the House of Commons incident, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the group &quot;has succeeded in becoming the most prominent guerrilla pressure group in Britain... within eighteen months of its founding&quot;.

In September 2004, member Jason Hatch climbed the walls of Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman; all charges relating to his protest were later dropped. Also in September, David Chick climbed the London Eye, forcing the attraction to close. He was found not guilty of charges of causing a public nuisance.

=== 2005 ===
In May 2005, campaigners dressed as superheroes protested on top of the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield during the World Snooker Championship.

Protester Ray Barry also climbed St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton on Fathers Day in June. He was later cleared of a public order offence charge, after which he repeated the protest on Christmas Day. On 27 September 2005, protester Guy Harrison climbed the Palace of Westminster unveiling a banner stating &quot;Does Blair care? For Fawkes sake change family law.&quot; A jury acquitted him of the charge of committing a public nuisance offence.

=== 2006 ===
During January 2006, &quot;The Sun&quot; published a story in which it claimed F4J members planned to kidnap Leo Blair, the young son of former Prime Minister Tony Blair &quot;for a few hours as a symbolic gesture&quot;. The police said they were aware of such a plan but added it had probably never progressed beyond the &quot;chattering stage&quot;. However, F4J Founder O&#x27;Connor condemned the alleged plot and threatened to shut down the group because of it. Within days, the group was disbanded.

In March 2006, F4J member and barrister Michael Cox was jailed for refusing to pay money he owed to the Child Support Agency. Cox told a hearing in Southampton he refused to pay on principle, as he had joint custody of his children, and his former wife wrote to the court in support of him.

F4J then re-formed again in May and protested during the showing of the BBC lottery show &quot;The National Lottery: Jet Set&quot; on 20 May. The show was taken off-air for several minutes after six F4J protesters ran from the audience onto the stage displaying posters bearing the words: &#x27;Family Law Lotto, Next Time It Could Be You!&#x27;.

=== 2008 ===
On 8 June 2008, two fathers from F4J climbed onto the roof of Labour Party deputy leader Harriet Harman&#x27;s house while wearing superhero-style costumes; they called themselves &quot;Captain Conception&quot; and &quot;Cash Gordon&quot;. One of the fathers, Mark Harris, said he wanted fathers to have the same rights as their children&#x27;s mothers&#x27; new partners. He also said they would not come down unless Harman read Harris&#x27; book, &quot;Family Court Hell&quot;. In the same month, Bristol Family Court was evacuated after a fire alarm was set off in the building during a F4J protest outside the building.

On 9 July, F4J members Nigel Ace and Tony Ashby, this time in Spider-Man and Batman outfits, climbed Harman&#x27;s roof and draped a banner that read &quot;Stop The War On Dads.&quot;

=== 2010 ===
In 2010, campaigners interrupted an interview with snooker player Steve Davis, causing the BBC to cut to a pre-recorded video segment.

=== 2011 ===
In July 2011, O&#x27;Connor staged a hunger strike just outside UK Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s home in Oxfordshire, demanding that he honour what O&#x27;Connor said were pledges about grandparents&#x27; rights to see their grandchildren, as well as rights governing shared parenting.

=== 2012 ===
In 2012, F4J staged a naked protest inside the Oxford Street branch of retailer Marks and Spencer in order to protest the shop&#x27;s advertising on parenting website Mumsnet which F4J believed &quot;promotes gender hatred&quot;.

=== 2013 ===
In June 2013, Paul Manning glued a picture of his 11-year-old son to John Constable&#x27;s 1821 painting &quot;The Hay Wain&quot; in the National Gallery in London. However, F2J later publicly withdrew support for Manning in January 2014, following alleged breaches of their terms and conditions.

Also in 2013, Tim Haries spray-painted the word &quot;Help&quot; on a portrait of Queen Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey. O&#x27;Connor announced that he would additionally target other art works in order to highlight his campaign.

On 9 August 2013, F4J protester Martyn Judd climbed onto the balcony of the Hilton Birmingham Metropole Hotel to protest what he asserted to be the inequality of fathers&#x27; treatment in family court cases during a CAFCASS conference at the hotel. The protest came to an end when sprinklers flooded the hotel.

=== 2014 ===
On 8 January 2014, Tim Haries was found guilty of defacing the portrait of the Queen. On 5 February 2014, Haries was sentenced by Judge McCreath at Southwark Crown Court to six months in custody.

=== 2015 ===
On 30 November 2015, two men involved with the group were arrested after a few hours of standing on the roof of Queens Gallery, an art gallery on Buckingham Palace grounds.

=== 2016 ===
On 15 June 2016, three F4J protesters stormed the stage of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot; shouting &quot;No Kids No Cash.&quot; The show was briefly taken off air.

On 22 August 2016, O&#x27;Connor walked on stage dressed as a priest during a live broadcast of the Rose of Tralee during Cavan Rose Lisa Reilly&#x27;s interview with host Dáithí Ó Sé. He was subsequently removed from the stage by security staff before being taken away by Gardaí.

=== 2018 ===
On 4 September 2018, while streamed live on the F4J Facebook page, O&#x27;Connor and his fellow protester Paul Robinson staged a messy protest at an ASDA Supermarket in Peterborough by pouring Coco Pops and milk all over the floor in the cereal aisle. The pair claimed that Kellogg&#x27;s latest slogan &quot;Loved By Kids, Approved By Mums&quot; was promoting cereal discrimination against dads. The pair paid for the items afterwards when police were called to the protest.

=== 2024 ===
On 15 December 2024, F4J protester Christopher Todd scaled the Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree whilst dressed as Santa and hung up a poster of Keir Starmer bearing the words: &#x27;Put the father back into Xmas&#x27;, and then proceeded to hang another poster of himself and his daughter on the Norwegian Spruce. The incident resulted in the temporary closure of Trafalgar Square whilst the police tried to talk him into coming down from the tree. He was eventually arrested and charged for causing criminal damage to the Christmas Tree, and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on January 22.

==Criticism==
Members of the group have been accused of conducting intimidating attacks in order to upset court staff, family lawyers, and Members of Parliament. During protests outside the offices of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), individual case workers were identified by name. One office of CAFCASS was forcibly entered by F4J members who then detained an unnamed employee; no criminal proceedings are known to have resulted.

Former members of the group have claimed F4J and the O&#x27;Connor family have &quot;lost its way&quot; by being sidetracked from reforming family law and instead descending into personal attacks on Twitter, libel (for which they were sued), and allegations of illegal acts such as putting an MP under surveillance and tracking her movements with a GPS tracking unit. Former members who do not agree with O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s leadership went on to form the New Fathers 4 Justice group in 2008.

==Impact==
An unintended result of the F4J campaign has been the exposure of flaws in security at Buckingham Palace, resulting in security enquiries or reviews there and also at the House of Commons.

<doc id="511110" wikidata="Q2043601" url="?curid=511110" title="P. N. Menon (director)">
<text>Palissery Narayanankutty Menon alias P. N. Menon (2 January 1926 – 9 September 2008) was an Indian film director and art director in the Malayalam cinema. He is also famous as the Designer of Promotional Posters. Menon was also the uncle of another popular film director Bharathan, being the younger brother of the latter&#x27;s father. In 2001, he was honoured with the J. C. Daniel Award, Kerala government&#x27;s highest honour for contributions to Malayalam cinema.

==Early life==
Born in Wadakkancherry, he completed his studies at Thrissur and from School of Art in Chennai. He came to Chennai when he was only 20 years old. He couldn&#x27;t find any job in Chennai, so travelled to Salem and become a production boy in a Studio. But, after two-and-a-half years, the studio was shut down and went back to Chennai. He got back to sketches, then painting, then doing magazine covers. One of his designing assignments was for one of Producer B. Nagi Reddy&#x27;s magazines. The production house was so impressed with his talent that when they bought Vahini Studio in 1951, Nagi Reddy&#x27;s son appointed him as a paid apprentice in the painting department.

He got a job as an art director in an English play produced by the daughter of the then Andhra Chief Minister. They had three performances in Delhi, one for the then Vice President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, another for then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the third for then Army Chief Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa. &quot;Ninamaninja Kalpadukal&quot; was his first movie Malayalam movie as the art director and his debut in the field of film direction in the 60s with the film &quot;Rosie&quot; (1965).

==Career==
Menon&#x27;s &quot;Olavum Theeravum&quot; based on M. T. Vasudevan Nair&#x27;s script and released in 1970. It won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film. Menon&#x27;s boldest film is &quot;Kuttiyedathi&quot; (Eldest Sister), again based on a short story by M. T. Vasudevan Nair.

Perhaps his most successful commercial film was &quot;Chembarathi&quot; (Hibiscus) which was based on a script by Malayattoor Ramakrishnan and starred newcomers like Raghavan, Sudhir and Roja Ramani (Sobhana) along with veteran actors like Madhu and Rani Chandra. Another script of Malayattoor Ramakrishnan named &quot;Gayathri&quot; which was directed by him was awarded the President&#x27;s Special Film Award Medal for National Integration. Menon&#x27;s film &quot;Malamukalile Daivam&quot;, has won National Award too.

After a long period of absence lasting more than a decade, he directed a film, &quot;Nerkkuneraey&quot; (&quot;Face to Face&quot;), in (2004).

==Poster Designer==

Menon made a name as a versatile Poster Designer as well. He artistic posters always helped the film to gain attention of cinegoers. He has also done posters even for Bollywood films like &quot;Anokha Rishta&quot; starring Rajesh Khanna. Some of the Malayalam films he had designed posters are &quot;Oomakkuyil&quot;, &quot;Kakkothikkavile Appooppan Thaadikal&quot;, &quot;Itha Innu Muthal&quot;, &quot;Poomadhathe Pennu&quot;, &quot;Aavanazhi&quot;, &quot;Amrutham Gamaya&quot; and &quot;Manivathoorile Aayiram Sivarathrikal&quot;.

==Personal life==

His wife&#x27;s name was Bharathi Menon and they had two daughters, named Rajasree and Jayasree. Popular film director Bharathan was his nephew, and was trained by him in direction. Bharathan predeceased his uncle.

==Death==
During his last years, Menon lived with his daughter in Kochi. He suffered from many serious illnesses like Alzheimer&#x27;s disease during this period. Finally, he died on 9 September 2008 aged 82, at a private hospital in Kochi. He was cremated with full state honours at Ravipuram Crematorium the next day.

<text>In published academic research, publication bias occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study biases the decision to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings in favor of positive results. The study of publication bias is an important topic in metascience.

Despite similar quality of execution and design, papers with statistically significant results are three times more likely to be published than those with null results. This unduly motivates researchers to manipulate their practices to ensure statistically significant results, such as by data dredging.

Many factors contribute to publication bias. For instance, once a scientific finding is well established, it may become newsworthy to publish reliable papers that fail to reject the null hypothesis. Most commonly, investigators simply decline to submit results, leading to non-response bias. Investigators may also assume they made a mistake, find that the null result fails to support a known finding, lose interest in the topic, or anticipate that others will be uninterested in the null results. The nature of these issues and the resulting problems form the five diseases that threaten science: &quot;&quot;significosis&quot;, an inordinate focus on statistically significant results; &quot;neophilia&quot;, an excessive appreciation for novelty; &quot;theorrhea&quot;, a mania for new theory; &quot;arigorium&quot;, a deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work; and finally, &quot;disjunctivitis&quot;, a proclivity to produce many redundant, trivial, and incoherent works.&quot;

Attempts to find unpublished studies often prove difficult or are unsatisfactory. In an effort to combat this problem, some journals require studies submitted for publication pre-register (before data collection and analysis) with organizations like the Center for Open Science.

Other proposed strategies to detect and control for publication bias include p-curve analysis and disfavoring small and non-randomized studies due to high susceptibility to error and bias.

==Definition==
Publication bias occurs when the publication of research results depends not just on the quality of the research but also on the hypothesis tested, and the significance and direction of effects detected. The subject was first discussed in 1959 by statistician Theodore Sterling to refer to fields in which &quot;successful&quot; research is more likely to be published. As a result, &quot;the literature of such a field consists in substantial part of false conclusions resulting from errors of the first kind in statistical tests of significance&quot;. In the worst case, false conclusions could canonize as being true if the publication rate of negative results is too low.

One effect of publication bias is sometimes called the file-drawer effect, or file-drawer problem. This term suggests that negative results, those that do not support the initial hypotheses of researchers are often &quot;filed away&quot; and go no further than the researchers&#x27; file drawers, leading to a bias in published research. The term &quot;file drawer problem&quot; was coined by psychologist Robert Rosenthal in 1979.

Positive-results bias, a type of publication bias, occurs when authors are more likely to submit, or editors are more likely to accept, positive results than negative or inconclusive results. Outcome reporting bias occurs when multiple outcomes are measured and analyzed, but the reporting of these outcomes is dependent on the strength and direction of its results. A generic term coined to describe these post-hoc choices is HARKing (&quot;Hypothesizing After the Results are Known&quot;).

==Evidence==
There is extensive meta-research on publication bias in the biomedical field. Investigators following clinical trials from the submission of their protocols to ethics committees (or regulatory authorities) until the publication of their results observed that those with positive results are more likely to be published. In addition, studies often fail to report negative results when published, as demonstrated by research comparing study protocols with published articles.

The presence of publication bias was investigated in meta-analyses. The largest such analysis investigated the presence of publication bias in systematic reviews of medical treatments from the Cochrane Library. The study showed that statistically positive significant findings are 27% more likely to be included in meta-analyses of efficacy than other findings. Results showing no evidence of adverse effects have a 78% greater probability of inclusion in safety studies than statistically significant results showing adverse effects. Evidence of publication bias was found in meta-analyses published in prominent medical journals.

Meta-analyses (reviews) have been performed in the field of ecology and environmental biology. In a study of 100 meta-analyses in ecology, only 49% tested for publication bias. While there are multiple tests that have been developed to detect publication bias, most perform poorly in the field of ecology because of high levels of heterogeneity in the data and that often observations are not fully independent.

, &quot;No trial published in China or Russia/USSR found a test treatment to be ineffective.&quot;

==Impact on meta-analysis==
Where publication bias is present, published studies are no longer a representative sample of the available evidence. This bias distorts the results of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. For example, evidence-based medicine is increasingly reliant on meta-analysis to assess evidence.

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews can account for publication bias by including evidence from unpublished studies and the grey literature. The presence of publication bias can also be explored by constructing a funnel plot in which the estimate of the reported effect size is plotted against a measure of precision or sample size. The premise is that the scatter of points should reflect a funnel shape, indicating that the reporting of effect sizes is not related to their statistical significance. However, when small studies are predominately in one direction (usually the direction of larger effect sizes), asymmetry will ensue and this may be indicative of publication bias.

Because an inevitable degree of subjectivity exists in the interpretation of funnel plots, several tests have been proposed for detecting funnel plot asymmetry. These are often based on linear regression including the popular Eggers regression test, and may adopt a multiplicative or additive dispersion parameter to adjust for the presence of between-study heterogeneity. Some approaches may even attempt to compensate for the (potential) presence of publication bias, which is particularly useful to explore the potential impact on meta-analysis results.

In ecology and environmental biology, a study found that publication bias impacted the effect size, statistical power, and magnitude. The prevalence of publication bias distorted confidence in meta-analytic results, with 66% of initially statistically significant meta-analytic means becoming non-significant after correcting for publication bias. Ecological and evolutionary studies consistently had low statistical power (15%) with a 4-fold exaggeration of effects on average (Type M error rates = 4.4).

The presence of publication bias can be detected by Time-lag bias tests, where time-lag bias occurs when larger or statistically significant effects are published more quickly than smaller or non-statistically significant effects. It can manifest as a decline in the magnitude of the overall effect over time. The key feature of time-lag bias tests is that, as more studies accumulate, the mean effect size is expected to converge on its true value.

==Compensation examples==
Two meta-analyses of the efficacy of reboxetine as an antidepressant demonstrated attempts to detect publication bias in clinical trials. Based on positive trial data, reboxetine was originally passed as a treatment for depression in many countries in Europe and the UK in 2001 (though in practice it is rarely used for this indication). A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that reboxetine was ineffective and that the preponderance of positive-outcome trials reflected publication bias, mostly due to trials published by the drug manufacturer Pfizer. A subsequent meta-analysis published in 2011, based on the original data, found flaws in the 2010 analyses and suggested that the data indicated reboxetine was effective in severe depression (see Reboxetine § Efficacy). Examples of publication bias are given by Ben Goldacre and Peter Wilmshurst.

In the social sciences, a study of published papers exploring the relationship between corporate social and financial performance found that &quot;in economics, finance, and accounting journals, the average correlations were only about half the magnitude of the findings published in Social Issues Management, Business Ethics, or Business and Society journals&quot;.

One example cited as an instance of publication bias is the refusal to publish attempted replications of Bem&#x27;s work that claimed evidence for precognition by &quot;The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot; (the original publisher of Bem&#x27;s article).

An analysis comparing studies of gene-disease associations originating in China to those originating outside China found that those conducted within the country reported a stronger association and a more statistically significant result.

==Risks==
John Ioannidis argues that &quot;claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.&quot; He lists the following factors as those that make a paper with a positive result more likely to enter the literature and suppress negative-result papers:
* The studies conducted in a field have small sample sizes.
* The effect sizes in a field tend to be smaller.
* There is both a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships.
* There is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes.
* There are prejudices (financial interest, political, or otherwise).
* The scientific field is hot and there are more scientific teams pursuing publication.

Other factors include experimenter bias and white hat bias.

==Remedies==
Publication bias can be contained through better-powered studies, enhanced research standards, and careful consideration of true and non-true relationships. Better-powered studies refer to large studies that deliver definitive results or test major concepts and lead to low-bias meta-analysis. Enhanced research standards such as the pre-registration of protocols, the registration of data collections, and adherence to established protocols are other techniques. To avoid false-positive results, the experimenter must consider the chances that they are testing a true or non-true relationship. This can be undertaken by properly assessing the false positive report probability based on the statistical power of the test and reconfirming (whenever ethically acceptable) established findings of prior studies known to have minimal bias.

===Study registration===

In September 2004, editors of prominent medical journals (including the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot;, and &quot;JAMA&quot;) announced that they would no longer publish results of drug research sponsored by pharmaceutical companies unless that research was registered in a public clinical trials registry database from the start. Furthermore, some journals (e.g. &quot;Trials),&quot; encourage publication of study protocols in their journals.

The World Health Organization (WHO) agreed that basic information about all clinical trials should be registered at the study&#x27;s inception and that this information should be publicly accessible through the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Additionally, the public availability of complete study protocols, alongside reports of trials, is becoming more common for studies.

===Megastudies===

In a megastudy, a large number of treatments are tested simultaneously. Given the inclusion of different interventions in the study, a megastudy&#x27;s publication likelihood is less dependent on the statistically significant effect of any specific treatment, so it has been suggested that megastudies may be less prone to publication bias. For example, an intervention found to be ineffective would be easier to publish as part of a megastudy as just one of many studied interventions. In contrast, it might go unreported due to the file-drawer problem if it were the sole focus of a contemplated paper. For the same reason, the megastudy research design may encourage researchers to study not only the interventions they consider more likely to be effective but also those interventions that researchers are less sure about and that they would not pick as the sole focus of the study due to the perceived high risk of a null effect.

<doc id="511119" wikidata="Q929760" url="?curid=511119" title="Epeli Ganilau">
<text>Brigadier-General Ratu Epeli Ganilau, MC, MSD, (10 October 1951 – 23 March 2023) was a Fijian military officer and politician. His career previously encompassed such roles as Commander of the Fiji Military Forces and Chairman of the &quot;Bose Levu Vakaturaga&quot; (Great Council of Chiefs). On 15 January 2007 he was sworn in as Minister for Fijian Affairs in the interim Cabinet formed in the wake of the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état which deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006.

==Early life==

Ganilau was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School, in New Zealand, from 1965. He later graduated from the University of the South Pacific and from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force Staff College.

==Military career==

He enlisted in the Royal Fiji Military Forces in June 1972, and attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK. He had served several tours of duty with the UN forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and with the Multinational Force &amp; Observers (MFO) in Sinai, Egypt. In 1979, as a company commander with the Fijian battalion serving with UN forces in Lebanon (1st Battalion, Fiji Infantry Regiment) Ganilau was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his leadership on operations at a time when UN forces and the Fijian battalion in particular, was being frequently attacked by armed groups in southern Lebanon. He attended the RNZAF Staff College in Auckland, NZ, and rose through the ranks to attain the rank of Brigadier. In July 1991, he was appointed Commander of the Military, succeeding Sitiveni Rabuka. He held this office for eight years, retiring in 1999 to pursue a career in politics.

==First foray into politics==

In 1998, he helped to found the Christian Democratic Alliance, which won three seats in the House of Representatives in the 1999 election, although he personally was not elected. He chose not to run in the 2001 elections. He also contested the traditional title of Tui Cakau in 2001 which was vacant at the time. Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu succeeded to the title of Tui Cakau, the Paramount Chief of the Tovata Confederacy which encompasses the provinces of Cakaudrove and Lau.

==Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs==

Ganilau was appointed to the &quot;Bose Levu Vakaturaga&quot; (Great Council of Chiefs) in 1999 as one of six representatives of the Fijian government. Ganilau was elected chairman on 3 May 2001 after his predecessor, Sitiveni Rabuka, stepped down amid accusations that he (Rabuka) may have been involved in the George Speight-led ethno-nationalist coup that deposed Fiji&#x27;s elected government in May 2000. The &quot;Bose Levu Vakaturaga&quot; was a formal assembly of Fijian hereditary chiefs, along with a number of specially qualified commoners, chosen mainly by Fiji&#x27;s provincial councils. The Council of Chiefs also had a constitutional role in functioning as an electoral college to elect the President of the Republic of Fiji, the Vice-President of Fiji, as well as 14 of the 32 Senators.

As chairman, Ganilau took a strong stand for law and order, and supported the prosecution of persons implicated in the 2000 coup. On 11 April 2003, he was quoted as saying that the ethnic politics promoted by nationalist politicians had resulted in coups that caused immense damage to the country. He spoke in support of Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who was then becoming increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Qarase government&#x27;s ethno-nationalist leanings and sympathies for the 2000 coupists.

Both Ganilau and Army Commander, Frank Bainimarama, viewed Qarase&#x27;s appeals to the primordial instincts of indigenous Fijians with deep suspicion. They saw Qarase&#x27;s affirmative action policies and his subtle use of imagined threats to indigenous Fijian interests as polarising society along ethnic lines. They resented Qarase&#x27;s use of ethnicity as a device to mobilise indigenous Fijian support. As far as Ganilau and Bainimarama were concerned, Fiji under Qarase was sliding headlong down a slippery slope towards a divided society with the spectre of a failed state looming large on the horizon. More importantly, it was a view shared by the Army.

On 6 August that year, Ganilau said that all persons implicated in that coup should be brought to justice, regardless of their position in the community. Culture and tradition should not, he said, impede the investigation of chiefs who had participated in the George Speight coup. He also rejected a call from Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, a Cabinet Minister and the Paramount Chief of the Tovata Confederacy, for the Great Council of Chiefs to replace the Senate as the upper house of the legislature. Ganilau argued that the chiefly system with its class distinctions and quasi-feudal values was incompatible with the democratic values underpinning modern representative government. To merge the two would create further confusion in the minds of indigenous Fijians who were already subject to two different administrative systems i.e. the laws and regulations of the central government viz a viz the laws regulating indigenous Fijian society under the Fijian Affairs Act (administered by the Ministry of i&#x27;Taukei Affairs).

Ganilau held the chairmanship until 21 July 2004 when Prime Minister Qarase did not renew Ganilau&#x27;s membership on the Council and replaced him with &quot;Ratu&quot; Ovini Bokini, a former deputy chairman and the chief of Tavua.

He was a government appointee to the Council and the government decision not to renew his membership effectively removed him from that body.

The Qarase government gave no reason for its decision not to reappoint Ganilau but there were strained relations between Ganilau and the ethno-nationalists in Qarase&#x27;s Cabinet who did not agree with Ganilau&#x27;s multiracial agenda. Information Minister and staunch nationalist, Simione Kaitani, had criticised Ganilau for calling for the resignation of Vice-President &quot;Ratu&quot; Jope Seniloli, who in 2004 was on trial for his involvement in the 2000 ethno-nationlist coup led by George Speight. Defending Seniloli, Kaitani argued that Seniloli was legally entitled to a presumption of innocence until proven guilty and until such guilt was proven, Seniloli should remain as President. Kaitani went on to accuse Ganilau of hypocrisy, saying that he (Ganilau) was involved in the forced resignation of his father-in-law, &quot;Ratu Sir&quot; Kamisese Mara, as President on 29 May 2000.

There were also accusations that Ganilau was undermining the so-called political neutrality of the &quot;Bose Levu Vakaturaga&quot; with his calls for a revival of the defunct Alliance Party, the multi-racial political party founded by Ratu Mara, which governed Fiji from 1967 to 1987. Ganilau&#x27;s call received support from a number of political factions, including the Indo-Fijian-dominated National Federation Party, but received a cold reception from Prime Minister Qarase&#x27;s Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua. They saw Ganilau&#x27;s multiracial agenda as an unwelcome threat to the nationalist i&#x27;taukei vote they required to remain in power. Ganilau had hinted that he himself would play a role in reviving the proposed Alliance with its focus on multiracialism. The decision to oust Ganilau from the leadership of the Great Council of Chiefs was widely seen as a move by Qarase to prevent Ganilau from using the Council as a platform to advance his (Ganilau) political agenda. Clearly, Qarase regarded Ganilau as a threat and had set a course to neutralise him.

Both Qarase and Ganilau held visions of Fiji that were incompatible. Ganilau had ideas of a united multiracial Fiji that was modelled on Ratu Mara&#x27;s Alliance government that governed the Dominion of Fiji from 1970 to 1987. In that set up the chiefs played an important mediating role among the various races in Fiji. Ganilau yearned for a return to those heady days when leadership was respected, political power was in the hands of respected Fijian high chiefs and race relations were stable. But in 1987 Mara and his chiefs lost power and indigenous Fijian paramountcy was restored through the Rabuka coup. After the coup of 1987, race and racial issues dominated the political discourse. Indigenous Fijian ethno-nationalism ran rampant. It divided Fiji society along racial lines. Ethnic minorities were marginalised. The Indo-Fijian community in particular was targeted. Many of them were thrown off the land they leased. Displaced Indo-Fijians congregated in refugee camps in some of the major towns. For the first time refugee camps were established in Fiji; indeed the whole South Pacific region. Thousands migrated overseas depriving Fiji of valuable human capital. This was the spectre that haunted Ganilau and other moderates like him who represented the silent majority in Fiji. They saw first hand the cost of racial politics and undertook to guard against its re-emergence. These issues provided the context for Ganilau&#x27;s multiracial vision. It was a vision that competed against the primordialism pursued by Qarase and the ethno-nationalists behind him.

==Founder of the National Alliance Party==

On 18 January 2005, Ganilau formally registered the National Alliance Party of Fiji. Joining him were university lecturer Meli Waqa as party secretary, and Manu Korovulavula as treasurer. Ganilau said the party would be multiracial and would pursue national reconciliation, something he had attempted without success as Chairman of the &quot;Bose Levu Vakaturaga.&quot; &quot;I was quite outspoken about the need to respect the rights all citizens in Fiji during my role as chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs,&quot; he said, &quot;but that did not go down well with some. That is why I decided it was best to continue the fight on a political platform.&quot;

In a speech to the Fiji Institute of Accountants on 28 April 2005, Ganilau called for a sense of national unity to be built by an emphasis on common values, shared by Indo-Fijians as well as indigenous Fijians. These values should, he said, include a vision of the kind of society Fiji should be – &quot;&quot;a Fiji where people of different ethnicities, religions and cultures can live and work together for the good of all, can differ without rancour, govern without violence and accept responsibility as reasonable people intent on serving the best interest of all&quot;.&quot; He called racism &quot;a primary force of evil designed to destroy good men,&quot; and asked all Fijian citizens to learn from the past to build a better future. &quot;I would like to make the point that we cannot undo the past but we can learn from it, and we cannot predict the future but we can shape and build it,&quot; Ganilau said.

On 3 May 2005, Ganilau strongly criticised Prime Minister Qarase for his calls for ethnic Fijians to unite politically to provide stable national leadership. Ganilau said this policy was &quot;divisive and a travesty of good governance and responsible leadership in a multiracial country like Fiji.&quot; He called on his fellow-chiefs to take a stand against what he considered a move to pit indigenous Fijians against other races. Ganilau also spoke of the importance of chiefly institutions, saying that chiefs provided permanent leadership for the Fijian people, unlike politicians who could be dismissed at the ballot box and were susceptible to the temptation to appeal to voters&#x27; racist sympathies to win power. &quot;Very often, to remain in power the easiest option for them would be to play the racist card, drum up fears of marginalisation and extinction of other ethnic groups,&quot; he said. He said the country would prosper if all political leaders would support the role of chiefly leaders and make &quot;a serious effort&quot; to bring together all the people of Fiji.

In a speech to the Lautoka Rotary Club on 13 May 2005, Ganilau called for better pay for professional and skilled workers, and also attacked racial discrimination in the employment, saying that it was socially and economically harmful and resulted in second rate replacements for talented people. &quot;&quot;When we leave out people on the grounds of ethnicity we limit our options,&quot; he said. &quot;As such, we become poorer because we are not making optimum use of our human resources, thereby depriving us of the returns and full benefit of our capabilities.&quot;

==Domestic policies==

Ganilau was an outspoken but moderate chief and politician, who opposed the divisive and inflammatory statements of political leaders. He was an idealist in many respects with a vision for a united, multicultural Fiji. Perhaps his greatest error as a politician lay in his underestimation of the strength and persistence of ethnic politics in Fiji. In opposition, Laisenia Qarase, advocated for policies to benefit indigenous Fijians, who are the majority population compared to the ethnic Indian minority.

===Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill===

Ganilau spoke against the plans of the Qarase government to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, with the power to grant amnesty to perpetrators of the 2000 coup and compensation to its victims. Ganilau first aired his opposition to the bill on 4 May 2005, saying that it was an unwarranted interference in the judicial process and represented a naïve and uncaring attitude to people who had suffered as a result of the coup. On 18 May he went further, saying that he saw &quot;nothing reconciliatory about the bill&quot; and that &quot;To use the word reconciliation is a gross violation of the rights of everyone in this nation.&quot;

On 16 June, Ganilau continued his attack on the legislation. He said that there was a widespread belief in Fiji that it was designed to provide for the freeing of coup perpetrators, a belief supported by the &quot;Tui Vaturova,&quot; Ratu Ilisoni Rokotuibua who said early in June that it would allow members of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit, who had been jailed for mutiny, to be released. Having built up such expectations, Ganilau said, the government had better be prepared for a strong backlash if they are not fulfilled. He criticised Qarase for expecting the people, as ordinary mortals, to do as only God could do by legislating forgiveness and freeing people from the consequences of their actions.

On 23 June, Ganilau accused the Prime Minister of having committed a &quot;monumental deception&quot; by asking church leaders to support the legislation without honestly explaining its real purpose to them. He was reacting to revelations from Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca and other church leaders that at a meeting with the Prime Minister on 2 May, they had been told of the reconciliation and compensation provisions of the legislation, but not about its amnesty provisions. &quot;It does not say much about the credibility of the Prime Minister for him to be saying publicly that the Christian churches support the bill after these deliberate acts of deception.&quot; Ganilau said. He called on churches to join with other religions to put together an alternative blueprint to the government&#x27;s reconciliation proposals.

===Law and order, moral values===

Speaking at the Crime Prevention/Reconciliation Sports Day in Flagstaff on 4 June 2005, Ganilau called on the older generation to instill basic moral values in their children. &quot;Increasing lawlessness and criminal activity can be interpreted as discourteous behaviour and lack of respect for other people and their property. So what we need to do if we want to salvage the situation is to go back to the basics,&quot; he said. The same day, he strongly criticised the country&#x27;s leadership, saying that they were taking Fiji in the wrong direction, &quot;spreading their gospel of fear and hate and not doing anything to help the ordinary people put bread on their table for their families.&quot; He warned against retaliation, however: &quot;I believe we must not fight fire with fire, we will be burnt.&quot; The only way extremist ethno-nationalists could be stopped from destroying the nation, he said, was to deny them the opportunity to control the destiny of the nation. This was seen as an oblique reference to the ethno-nationalists in Qarase&#x27;s cabinet. He also called on people to respect one another, saying that it was the only way for lasting unity and reconciliation.

At the 80th birthday celebration of Satya Sai Baba at Lautoka&#x27;s Girmit Centre on 23 November 2005, Ganilau called for more religious programs to promote morality in private and public life. Most politicians were selfish and lacked moral values, he claimed. Teaching young people good values at home and at school would be &quot;useless&quot; if adults and political leaders were doing what children were taught not to do, he declared. He said that the country had strayed from spiritual values and had lost its way, with bribery, extortion, misuse of public funds, abuse of office, and racism having become common place at all levels of government. He claimed that the number of beggars and unschooled children was increasing while politicians were engaged in &quot;egotistical pursuits.&quot;

In the same address, Ganilau also declared that all religions have the same essential teaching about the unity of divinity and the cultivation of universal love, and condemned those he considered responsible for creating &quot;confusion&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; by &quot;fragmenting divinity&quot;. &quot;How often have we seen the bigotry of the religious fanaticisms and intolerance that have occurred in Fiji?&quot; he asked. &quot;Temples have been desecrated, places of worship are destroyed, all in the prejudice view that one religion is the true one and others are not.&quot;

===Ethnic relations===

Ganilau was a guest speaker at the Lautoka conference of the Fiji Labour Party, with which his own party subsequently formed a coalition to contest the general election scheduled for 2006, on 30 July 2005. Calling for changes in the attitudes of indigenous Fijians to allow everyone born in Fiji to be classified as &quot;Fijian,&quot; he said that the country could not afford to remain fragmented and polarised on racial lines, and that racially based measures enacted by the present government were shortening the fuse on a time bomb. &quot;Government seems unaware that the more race-based measures it tries to put in place the faster that time bomb burns to detonation point,&quot; Ganilau said. He said that until Fiji Islanders got out of their ethnic boxes and embraced multiculturalism, Fiji&#x27;s future as a nation would not be secure. He expressed disbelief that after a century and a quarter of sharing the land, the level of cultural interaction between the major racial groups was so low.

Speaking at the launch in Rakiraki of his own party&#x27;s campaign for the 2006 election on 6 August 2005, Ganilau said that the future of the nation&#x27;s children would not be secure unless the people freed themselves from what he called &quot;the comfort zone of our race.&quot; He said it was important to break down the imaginary ethnic wall separating the people. &quot;We should not allow ourselves, individually or our ethnic communities to become easy tools for politics of race that will continue to segregate us mentally and emotionally,&quot; he said. He strongly criticised recent moves to form an ethnic Fijian electoral block, saying that would be divisive and would never lead to national unity. He accused &quot;unscrupulous politicians&quot; of promoting racially divided visions for Fiji.

He continued his attack on racially divisive politics with a number of speeches and interviews in the last week of August. He condemned Senator Apisai Tora for saying that indigenous Fijians would not accept a non-indigenous Prime Minister, and charged the government with fostering ethnic tensions to distract the public from its own &quot;non-performance&quot;. He also accused the government of handling its relations with Opposition parties in a &quot;crude and amateurish way&quot; which prevented any cross-party agreement on land reform, necessary for obtaining the two-thirds parliamentary majority for amending the Constitution. This would create a mess for the next government to clean up after the 2006 election, Ganilau said on 27 August.

===Chiefs and the political order===

On 4 September, Ganilau strongly criticised Prime Minister Qarase for comments made at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Nadi on 29 August. Qarase had said that while Fiji &quot;accepted&quot; western-style democracy, it was an alien concept and certain aspects of it clashed with Fijian traditions, in which chiefs were at the apex by virtue of their birth and rank. Ganilau ridiculed Qarase&#x27;s speech, saying that Fiji&#x27;s political and judicial institutions were firmly rooted in western democracy and that the Fijian people should not be &quot;misled&quot; by the Prime Minister&#x27;s claims that democracy was alien to the country. &quot;Mr Qarase should answer whether he wants the western system of governance which allows him to be Prime Minister, or the Fijian tradition which requires the chiefs to rule by virtue of their birthright and rank. Otherwise, he is just being hypocritical to save face,&quot; Ganilau said.

Ganilau spoke out on 16 September to dismiss claims that most of Fiji&#x27;s problems were being caused by the &quot;disrespect&quot; of Indo-Fijians and other non-indigenous communities towards the country&#x27;s chiefs. Making a parliamentary submission on controversial Unity Bill, Masi Kaumaitotoya had declared that the jailing of chiefs on coup-related offences was a clear sign of disrespect, and that indigenous Fijians were being taken advantage of by others. In response, Ganilau said as the former Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs that he believed that the chiefs were well respected by all communities. He also called on his fellow chiefs to play a greater role in promoting national unity by serving all citizens in their district or confederacy, regardless of race. Chiefs who had participated in the 2000 coup should not get preferential treatment, he added.

===The AIDS crisis===

There was a spike in AIDS cases in Fiji, jumping from only 10 cases in the year 2000 to 111 in 2003, with indigenous Fijians making up 80% of cases. Ganilau signed an agreement with the UN AIDS Pacific in 2004, and planned follow up meetings to determine how to combat the spread of the virus. Fiji&#x27;s Great Council of Chiefs hosted a week-long workshop called &#x27;Accelerating Action Against Aids in the Pacific&#x27; that was also sponsored by UNAIDS.

Speaking at the Pan Pacific HIV/AIDS Conference in Auckland, New Zealand in late October 2005, Ganilau called for strong leadership to confront HIV/AIDS, saying that it was a global war which threatened the very future of Pacific Islands nations. &quot;We can only ignore this battle at the cost of being regarded by future generations of Pacific Islanders as lacking the will, the foresight, the understanding to tackle this issue, which threatens our very future,&quot; he told the delegates.

===Criticism of affirmative action===

Launching the Lautoka branch of his party on 24 November 2005, Ganilau said that affirmative action in favour of indigenous Fijians had not benefited ordinary Fijians, but had served only to facilitate the survival of the government in power and acted as a cover-up for the lack of effective policies. Instead of affirmative action, he said, the government should do more to assist Fijian landowners to develop their land commercially, and to improve educational and economic opportunities for ordinary people.

===The politicisation of the military===

In an interview with Australian ABC Television&#x27;s Asia Pacific Focus programme on 27 November 2005, Ganilau regretted the way the military had become politicised since the 1987 coups. People including former failed politicians with no military training whatsoever were rewarded for their political support of Rabuka by being commissioned as officers. These included senior NCOs who were promoted beyond their competence to commissioned rank thus leaving a yawning gap at the NCO level that resulted in a loss of capability. The high standards of professionalism of the Fijian military was seriously compromised. Its reputation as an apolitical professional military organisation was in tatters. It would take several years, he said, before the military could regain its professional standards and the respect it previously enjoyed from the community.

==2006 election==

The National Alliance Party announced on 17 March 2006 that Ganilau would lead the party into the election scheduled for 6–13 May, and that he would contest the Suva City Open Constituency. The attempt was unsuccessful; neither Ganilau nor any of his party&#x27;s candidates were elected.

==2006 coup d&#x27;état==

Months of tension between the government and the Republic of Fiji Military Forces culminated in a military coup on 5 December 2006. Citing alleged governmental corruption, Ganilau told Fiji Television that he supported the &quot;cause&quot; of the military, but not its method, and denied public rumours that he had been a party to the planning of the coup. He called on his fellow-chiefs, however, to accept the &quot;reality&quot; of the Military takeover and work to move the country forward. He also claimed that he had been asked to mediate between the Great Council of Chiefs and the Military, as a former head of both bodies, but the council chairman, Ratu Ovini Bokini, angrily denied making any such request. &quot;I never made a request to meet the commander. Whoever said that is lying. I don&#x27;t intend to see the commander. He has to make a request to me if he wants to meet me,&quot; Bokini declared. In making that statement Bokini regarded the Great Council of Chiefs as remaining above secular politics as well as the various institutions of government, including the Army. It was an unrealistic and erroneous notion given the history of chiefly support for the ethno-nationalist coups of 1987 and 2000.

In the interim government that was formed after the coup, Ganilau served for one year as Minister of Defense, at the request of President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, but resigned a year later when it became clear that the interim government was not delivering on its promise to hold elections.

Ganilau was the Minister of Defense under Bainimarama, but resigned in 2010.

==2013 Constitution== 

Frank Bainimarama and those behind him had ideas to create another Constitution that would purportedly assuage ethic Fijian fears and form the basis of a united, multicultural Fiji. The drawing up of a new Constitution was a complicated process that needed time. Indeed, it was not until 2014 that national elections under a new (2013) Constitution took place. Critics of the 2013 Constitution of Fiji say it should have been put to a referendum to give it credibility. They say it was foisted upon the people without their consent. For the Bainimarama government the elections of 2014 and 2018 gave legitimacy to the Constitution.

The unfettered powers the Bainimarama government enjoyed during its term as an unelected military government (2006-2014) led it to retain some of the draconian laws and decrees it had introduced during its tenure. It retained the modus operandi of maintaining a very close watch over the population where dissenters and potential dissenters were victimised. New rules and regulations covering virtually every activity in society led some to complain that Fiji was a small country with so many rules. Those who disagreed with the decisions of government were soon marginalised. Fijians living overseas including academics who were critical of government policy were banned from ever returning to Fiji. Senior public servants who did not toe the government line were soon pushed out to pasture and investigated by the government&#x27;s &#x27;anti corruption&quot; watchdog. The security forces exceeded their powers in the bashing of dissenters. It created a climate of fear. Government was accused of paranoia.

Democracy was a facade,the critics argued. Real power was being exercised by two men backed by the Army and Police: viz the inarticulate Prime Minister reading from prepared scripts written for him by hired US publicity agents QORVIS; backed by his ambitious Indo-Fijian Attorney General and Deputy Prime Minister who saw things in black and white and who micro-managed all aspects of government policy and administration. He was regarded as the &#x27;real prime minister&#x27; making decisions behind the scenes for his bumbling leader. He was a man not to be crossed, a highly polarising figure.

The i&#x27;Taukei (indigenous population) felt their rights were being eroded and their identity disrespected. The results of the 2018 elections confirmed the polarisation of races. The noble aims of the 2013 Constitution existed only in theory. At the practical level, the personal attacks and mudslinging against the indigenous leaders and those opposed to government served to galvanise political unity within the indigenous population against the Bainimarama government. Group identity and solidarity in the face of perceived threats was being emphasised by the Opposition. Ironically, the political behaviour of the Bainimarama government towards its political opponents compelled the latter to play upon the primordial instincts of indigenous Fijians. Backed into a corner the Opposition had no other choice. They were between a rock and a hard place.

Ratu Epeli Ganilau was named a presidential candidate in 2015, but the position was won by Jioji Konrote. Konrote was not a member of the Council of Chiefs. This election was the first secret ballot cast under the 2013 Fijian Constitution.

In the November 2018 elections, the governing Fiji First Party was returned with a very much reduced majority securing just over 50% of the votes and losing six seats in the process. A strategic shift in voting patterns against the Fiji First government had taken place. In the face of perceived threats to its identity indigenous Fijian group interests increasingly came to determine their political choices. Whether this trend will gain sufficient momentum over the next four years to bring about a change of government in 2022 remains to be seen. Ni sa moce.

==Personal life==

Ganilau hailed from the village of Somosomo, in Taveuni. He was the son of the late Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the first President of the Republic of Fiji (1987–1993). Like his late father, Ratu Epeli was a member of the same Mataqali Valelevu (the tribal landowning unit) of which the Tui Cakau is the head. Originally they were a migrant tribe who referred to themselves as the Ai Sokula who settled and subsequently merged with their host society, the Cakaudrove people on the south coast of Vanua Levu near the village of Vunisavisavi. The Ai Sokula led by their chief, the Tui Cakau, achieved ascendancy over others through conquest. They subsequently moved to Taveuni and later occupied the village site of Somosomo which became the seat of the Tui Cakau and the Vanua of Lalagavesi. Ratu Epeli was a member of the Ai Sokula (the term refers to the chiefs of the Vanua of Lalagavesi). He was a relative of the current Tui Cakau (Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu). Ratu Epeli Ganilau was married to Adi Ateca Mara, the eldest daughter of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the founding father of modern Fiji. Adi Ateca died in November 2018. They had two sons and two daughters. Ganilau also had nine grandchildren. His hobbies included rugby, boxing, and shooting.

Ganilau died on 23 March 2023, at the age of 71.

<doc id="511120" wikidata="Q2946066" url="?curid=511120" title="United States Navy reserve fleets">
<text>The United States Navy maintains a number of its ships as part of a reserve fleet, often called the &quot;Mothball Fleet&quot;. While the details of the maintenance activity have changed several times, the basics are constant: keep the ships afloat and sufficiently working as to be reactivated quickly in an emergency.

In some cases (for instance, at the outset of the Korean War), many ships were successfully reactivated at a considerable savings in time and money. The usual fate of ships in the reserve fleet, though, is to become too old and obsolete to be of any use, at which point they are sold for scrapping or are scuttled in weapons tests.

In rare cases, the general public may intercede for ships from the reserve fleet that are about to be scrapped – usually asking for the Navy to donate them for use as museum ships, memorials, or artificial reefs.

== Administration ==

In November 1976, the controlling organization was the Inactive Ship Division of the Naval Ship Systems Command. As of 2011, the controlling organization actually appears to be the Inactive Ships Management Office of the Program Executive Officer – Ships, Naval Sea Systems Command, Portsmouth, Virginia.

Merchant ships held in reserve are managed as part of the separate National Defense Reserve Fleet within MARAD (US Maritime Administration). Several of its sites, such as at Suisun Bay in California, are also used to store regular Navy ships.

===Maintenance categories===
Ships placed in the reserve fleets are categorized depending on priority, funding and the planned disposition.

Category B
Ships in this category are prioritized over the other categories when it comes to maintenance and funding. They are retained for possible future mobilization and will receive updates and upgrades as funding permits.

Category C
These are ships that will be maintained as-is; meaning no updates or improvements unless funding becomes available after that assigned for category B ships has been exhausted.

Category D
Temporary state pending planned usage by the Navy, will be maintained as-is.

Category X
Ships stricken from the Naval Vessel Register awaiting disposal. Receives no maintenance except ships on donation hold, which undergo dehumidification and cathodic protection.

Category Z
This category is for nuclear-powered ships and related support ships pending disposal.

==History==
Around 1912, the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and the Pacific Reserve Fleet were established as reserve units with still operating ships, but on a greatly reduced schedule.

After the Second World War, with hundreds of ships no longer needed by a peacetime navy, each fleet consisted of a number of groups corresponding to storage sites, each adjacent to a shipyard for easier reactivation. For example, was underway for Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 11 April 1945. &quot;Brock&quot; arrived there on 13 April 1945, and joined the Florida Group, 16th Fleet, which later became the Florida Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Many of the deactivated World War II merchant vessels were of a class called Liberty ships which were mass-produced ocean-going transports used primarily in the convoys going to/from the U.S., Europe, and Russia. Liberty ships were also used as the navy&#x27;s support vessels for its fleet of warships and to ferry forces across the Pacific and Atlantic.

Most Liberty ships when deactivated were put into &quot;mothball fleets&quot; strategically located around the coasts of the U.S., or sold into commercial service. They began to be deactivated and scrapped in the early 1970s.

=== Atlantic Reserve Fleet ===
Vice Admirals Herbert F. Leary and Thomas C. Kinkaid served as Commanders, Sixteenth Fleet, after World War II. Sixteenth Fleet later became the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

The groups of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet were at Boston, Charleston, Green Cove Springs, Florida, New London, MOTBY/New York Harbor, Norfolk, Philadelphia, and Texas.

=== Pacific Reserve Fleet ===
The Nineteenth Fleet became the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

The groups of the Pacific Reserve Fleet were at Alameda, Bremerton, Columbia River, Long Beach, Mare Island, San Diego, San Francisco, Stockton, Tacoma, and Olympia, Washington (Budd Inlet).

===James River Reserve Fleet===

The James River Reserve Fleet consists of a small number of decommissioned U.S. Navy auxiliaries and warships anchored in Virginia&#x27;s James River near Newport News.
The fleet originally comprised approximately 60 ships, most of which were gradually towed away for scrapping.
From 2012 to 2016, among its few remaining vessels was , previously a NASA recovery ship for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s solid rocket boosters, which was then loaned out to the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education in Piney Point, Maryland, as a training vessel.

===Suisun Bay===

A similar fleet, the National Defense Reserve Fleet, is anchored in Suisun Bay near Benicia, California, and has similarly been reduced. This location is known for hosting the &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot; after its recovery of portions of Soviet submarine &quot;K-129&quot; during the Cold War before its subsequent reactivation as a minerals exploration ship.

===Beaumont===
The Beaumont Reserve Fleet, anchored in the Neches River near Beaumont, Texas, contains a number of transport ships.

==Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facilities==

A Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF) is a facility owned by the U.S. Navy as a holding facility for decommissioned naval vessels, pending determination of their final fate. All ships in these facilities are inactive, but some are still on the Naval Vessel Register, while others have been struck from that Register.

===Philadelphia===
The Philadelphia Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility holds several dozen inactive warships, including the aircraft carrier , Ticonderoga class cruisers, Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, and numerous supply ships.

===Bremerton===
The Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, located next to Bremerton, Washington, hosts, among its other ships two dozen decommissioned submarines, several frigates, and numerous supply ships. It is the former home of the nuclear cruiser , which was scrapped.

===Pearl Harbor===
The Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, holds logistic support ships and amphibious transport dock ships. Several of these ships have served as target ships for Sink Exercises (SINKEX) during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercises.

==Ready Reserve Force==

*The Ready Reserve Force (RRF) is a subset of ships in MARAD&#x27;s National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). Ready Reserve Force supports the rapid worldwide deployment of U.S. military forces.

<text>Baron Trevethin, of Blaengawney in the County of Monmouth, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1921 for the prominent judge Sir Alfred Lawrence, Lord Chief Justice of England from 1921 to 1922.

The first baron&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Hon. Clive Lawrence, predeceased him; he had been HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor from 1923 until his death in 1926. Hence, on the first baron&#x27;s death, the title passed to his second son, Charles. 

The first baron&#x27;s third son, the Hon. Geoffrey Lawrence, was also a noted jurist and served as the main British judge at the Nuremberg trials. In 1947 he was himself raised to the peerage as Baron Oaksey, of Oaksey in the County of Wilts. In 1959 he succeeded his elder brother Charles as third Baron Trevethin, although he continued to be known as Lord Oaksey.

 the titles are held by his grandson, the fifth Baron Trevethin and third Baron Oaksey, who succeeded in 2012. He is a KC who sits in the House of Lords as a Crossbench excepted hereditary peer following a by-election in 2015.

<doc id="511129" wikidata="Q1126314" url="?curid=511129" title="Orphaned Land">
<text>Orphaned Land is an Israeli heavy metal band formed in 1991. They are known to combine Mizrahi and Maghrebi Jewish, Arabic, Turkish, and other Middle Eastern and North African musical elements, with metal (with particular influence from Yemenite Jewish and, in their early years, Moroccan Jewish music), as well as from Sephardic music, and other sounds from the Mediterranean Region. They have also included &quot;metalized&quot; versions of various piyyutim in all of their albums since &quot;El Norra Alila&quot;. The band are considered to be the pioneers of oriental metal. Orphaned Land have gone through several lineup changes over the years, but have retained two founding members of the band, Kobi Farhi (vocals) and Uri Zelcha (bass). They are joined by Matan Shmuely (drums), Chen Balbus (guitars/saz) who replaced co-founding member Matti Svatizky in 2011, and Idan Amsalem (guitars/bouzouki) who replaced co-founding member Yossi Sassi in early 2014. Their lyrics promote a message of peace and unity, particularly between the three main Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). The name &quot;Orphaned Land&quot; comes from the lyrics of a Yehuda Poliker song and reflects &quot;a paradox&quot; to the term &quot;Holy Land&quot;. Four of their six albums are concept albums relating to the concept of light and darkness.

Despite Orphaned Land&#x27;s songs drawing on biblical themes, the band have said that they are not religious, with the majority of the band members identifying as atheist or agnostic, and are known for their ambivalence towards organized religion, blaming it as the cause of bloodshed and hatred. Orphaned Land&#x27;s frontman Kobi Farhi claims that metal is a kind of &quot;religion&quot;.

Orphaned Land has developed a large following, &quot;tens of thousands of fans&quot;, across the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Iran, and have been described as &quot;ambassadors of peace&quot; for their message of unity, despite the heavy metal genre being considered taboo in, and with the State of Israel being considered an enemy of many of these countries. In the Arab world, metal music is part of the underground; Orphaned Land once toured in Europe with a Jordanian band who wasn&#x27;t allowed to play in their home country. In 2013, Orphaned Land toured Europe with the Palestinian band Khalas which Farhi claims proved that Jewish-Muslim coexistence is possible. The two bands would issue a split album with each other in 2021, entitled &quot;&quot;The Peace Series Vol 1&quot;.&quot; The only Muslim-majority country in which the band has played is Turkey; however, they were invited to play Dubai, but the show was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have played in Turkey over 25 times which Muslim fans all over the world would attend, especially those from the Middle East, Iran, and Morocco.

==History==
=== Resurrection (1991-1992) ===
At the start of the band&#x27;s formation, they played &quot;regular&quot; death metal under the name &quot;Resurrection&quot;, with the goal to sound like At the Gates, Morbid Angel, Death, Deicide, and other similar sounding bands, and sang about topics like &quot;death from radiation decay.&quot; They quickly realized, however, that they are &quot;from a different place, a place with different temperature, culture, and colours, that is also the source of all the monotheistic beliefs&quot;, as explained by frontman Kobi Farhi. The band chose to write music that better projected this, incorporating Middle Eastern and North African melodies and folk rhythms into their sound. In 1992, they changed their name to &quot;Orphaned Land&quot;, believing that this name better suits their newer, more melodic style, which they dubbed oriental metal. This new style fused melodic death metal and melodic death-doom with elements of progressive metal, incorporating Middle Eastern and North African musical traditions as well as those of Mizrahi, Maghrebi Jewish, and Arabic origins, which has been described as a kind of early folk metal.

=== Sahara, El Norra Alila, and hiatus (1993-2001) ===
In 1993, Orphaned Land released their demo &quot;The Beloved&#x27;s Cry&quot;, and in 1994, they released their first album &quot;&quot;Sahara&quot;&quot;, in which the band reworked four of the demo&#x27;s six songs and wrote four new ones.

In 1996, they released their second album &quot;El Norra Alila&quot;, their first concept album, in which they amplified the &quot;oriental&quot; elements. The name of the album is based on the piyyut of the same name, which is recited during Yom Kippur as a plea of forgiveness, but also acts as a play on words using both Hebrew and Arabic, and can be translated as &quot;God of Light, Evil of the Night,&quot; referring to the album&#x27;s concept. The album also includes traditional Mizrahi piyyutim as songs, as well as sporadic use of Jewish liturgy, with heavier emphasis on Arabic melodies from their previous release. It explored the themes of light and darkness, conveying the message of commonality between the three main Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). This is a theme they would continue to use throughout their next three concept albums, as well.

After the release of &quot;El Norra Alila&quot; in 1996, Orphaned Land went into &quot;this unknown hiatus&quot;, during which &quot;nothing happened&quot;. However, in 2001, Farhi received an email from a Jordanian fan who sent him a video of himself revealing a tattoo of the Orphaned Land logo on his arm. Farhi, who was &quot;shocked&quot; by this, given the geopolitical circumstances, considers this the motivating factor to get the band back together, and began recording their next album. They played several shows in Tel Aviv and one in Turkey, their first show abroad. The Jordanian fan who sent Farhi the video came to the show in Turkey, where he brought an Arabic book written by an Egyptian sheikh about Satanism. The book, which detailed how to avoid Satanic groups in Egypt, displayed the lyrics to an Orphaned Land song that contains verses from the Quran. When asked for elaboration by Farhi, the fan explained how the Egyptian National Police raided an Egyptian metalhead&#x27;s house and discovered a CD with this song on it; the Egyptian fan was sent to prison for six months as this was enough to charge him of blasphemy.

=== Mabool (2002-2009) ===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Mabool: The Story of the Three Sons of Seven&quot; was released in 2004, and was the band&#x27;s second concept album. &quot;&quot;Mabool&quot; (מבול) is the Hebrew word for &quot;flood&quot;, and refers to the Genesis flood narrative from which the album&#x27;s concept, the band&#x27;s reinterpretation of Noah&#x27;s Ark, is derived. It tells the story of three sons (one for each Abrahamic religion) who try to warn humanity of a flood coming as punishment for their sins. The album retains the &quot;oriental&quot; instruments from their previous two albums, and also includes two choruses, traditional Yemenite Jewish chants sung by Shlomit Levi, and quotes of biblical verses from chapters 6–9 in Genesis, read by Kobi Farhi.

In 2005, Orphaned Land released the EP &quot;Ararat&quot;, named after Mount Ararat where Noah&#x27;s Ark landed, which contains two demos of songs &quot;Mabool&quot;, and one reworked track from it, as well as a cover of the song &quot;Mercy&quot; from Paradise Lost. The band describes their first two concept albums as &quot;a meeting of East and West, past and present, light and darkness, and a tango between God and Satan.

In 2008, Orphaned Land was featured in the documentary &quot;Global Metal&quot;, a film by the creators of &quot;&quot;.

=== The Never Ending Way of ORwarriOR (2010-2012) ===
In January, 2010, Orphaned Land released the follow-up to &quot;Mabool&quot;, and their fourth album, entitled &quot;The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR&quot;. In Hebrew, the word &quot;or&quot; (אור) means &quot;light&quot;, thus &quot;ORwarriOR&quot; can be translated as &quot;light warrior&quot; or &quot;warrior of light&quot;, and is the band&#x27;s third concept album. Like &quot;El Norra Alila&quot;, &quot;ORwarriOR&quot; explores themes light and darkness; this time the album is about the battle between the darkness, a place of questions, and the light, a place of answers. The album has a different sound than &quot;Mabool&quot;, was produced and mixed by Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, and made free to download for any fan who lives in a &quot;number of&quot; MENA countries. The first single from the CD was titled &quot;Sapari&quot; and was put on Myspace with two other tracks, &quot;Vayehi OR&quot; and &quot;Disciples of the Sacred Oath II&quot;, a sequel to a song from the deluxe edition of &quot;El Norra Alila&quot;. In early 2011, &quot;ORWarriOR&quot; was rated the Metal Storm number one progressive metal album of 2010 by users with 421/1130 total votes.

On May 22, 2010, Orphaned Land performed as the opening act to Metallica&#x27;s show in Israel. Orphaned Land then went on a festival tour in the summer of 2010, promoting &quot;The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR&quot;, with appearances at festivals such as Wacken Open Air, Summer Breeze Open Air, Sonisphere Festival, Gods of Metal, Rock Hard Festival, and more. After the summer festival tour, Orphaned Land, along with Swallow the Sun, went on a North American tour in support of Katatonia. Orphaned Land then followed this with a tour of Europe alongside Ghost Brigade supporting Amorphis. In February 2011, Orphaned Land performed at the Riviera cultural festival at VIT University in Vellore, India. In February 2012, they returned to India and played at the Alcheringa festival at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.

On June 19, 2011, Orphaned Land performed at the Hellfest metal festival held in Clisson, France. Orphaned Land is known to employ belly dancers at their shows, however for this show, Lebanese belly dancer Johanna Fakhry reached out to Orphaned Land and requested to perform with the band there. While Kobi Farhi agreed to this request, he warned her that it could be dangerous for her. Fakhri decided to join them on stage anyway. At this performance, Farhi and Fakhry held up the Israeli and Lebanese flags side-by-side at the end of the concert as a gesture of peace. After word in Lebanon spread about this performance, Fakhry&#x27;s parents expressed outrage towards her for this action, she was ridiculed online by Arab communities, and the Shia Islamist organization Hezbollah issued a death warrant to her. Fakhry has not returned to Lebanon since then, and has remained in France. According to Farhi, Orphaned Land has invited her to shows in Israel, but she has rejected the offers out of respect for her parents&#x27; wishes.

In 2011, Orphaned Land played two concerts in Israel to celebrate their 20th anniversary. On October 24, the band released a live music and video album entitled &quot;The Road to Or-Shalem&quot;, featuring recordings of this concert to celebrate their milestone. On June 11, 2012, guitarist Matty Svatitzky announced his departure from the band, citing personal issues. Matti Svatitzky was replaced by Chen Balbus, a young musician who was had performed live with them, previously.

In 2012 an online petition opened up requesting the Norwegian Nobel Committee consider Orphaned Land to be awarded the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize, which the band&#x27;s label, Century Media Records, supported.

=== All Is One (2013-2016) ===
Orphaned Land released their fifth album, entitled &quot;All is One&quot;, on June 24, 2013. This album featured a shift in sound for Orphaned Land, who took a lusher, more symphonic approach to the album than their previous releases, and who experienced a line-up change beforehand. Despite its optimistic title, the band considers it their darkest album thematically; albeit, musically it is their most accessible, least progressive, and lightest album, being nearly devoid of death metal influence. Farhi provided very few death growls on this album, and the highly acclaimed Israeli-Arab singer, Mira Awad, provided female vocals for it.

On January 7, 2014, Orphaned Land announced on their Facebook page that guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and co-founding band member Yossi Sassi had left the band. He was replaced by guitarist Idan Amsalem.

Orphaned Land won the Metal Hammer award for &quot;Global Metal Band of the Year 2014&quot;. The band also released a new music video for the track &quot;Let the Truce Be Known,&quot; directed by Vadim Machona.

=== Unsung Prophets &amp; Dead Messiahs (2017-present) ===
In 2017, former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett contacted Farhi, in his search for artists that work for peace between people, and asked him to perform in a song about peace. The two sides immediately clicked and started collaborating. Together with Mira Awad, Farhi sings in the song &quot;West to East&quot; on Hackett&#x27;s album, &quot;The Night Siren&quot;. According to Farhi, Hackett offered to either play a guitar solo on an Orpahend Land album or to pay Farhi directly for his performance, and Farhi chose the guitar solo. Hackett appears on the song &quot;Chains Fall to Gravity&quot; from their upcoming album.

On January 26, 2018, Orphaned Land released their sixth album, entitled &quot;Unsung Prophets &amp; Dead Messiahs&quot;, and is the band&#x27;s fourth concept album. Once again utilizing the concepts of light and darkness to convey their message, the album is based around Plato&#x27;s Allegory of the cave to explain how humanity embraces the darkness and are afraid to break their chains and embrace the light. Farhi considers it to be their &quot;protest album&quot;. For &quot;Unsung Prophets &amp; Dead Messiahs&quot;, Orphaned Land wanted to combine the accessible, &quot;upfront&quot; sound of &quot;All Is One&quot; with the conceptual and progressive sound of &quot;Mabool&quot; and &quot;ORwarriOR&quot;, believing that would lead to the creation of &quot;the best Orphaned Land album&quot;.

In September 2018, Orphaned Land won the Video Of The Year award at the Progressive Music Awards 2018 in London, for their video, &quot;Like Orpheus&quot;. The music video is based on a true story about a Muslim girl who used to attend metal shows in Israel. A photo taken of her in a hijab with the lead singer of Behemoth in his corpse paint went viral, after which her parents forbade her from associating with the &quot;metal world&quot;. The music video depicts a Haredi Jewish man and a Muslim woman attending a Kreator concert at night, while hiding their association with the metal community from their families.

In June 2021, Orphaned Land celebrated their 30th anniversary by playing a concert at the prestigious Heichal HaTarbut, the largest concert hall in Israel. Backed by the 45-piece Israel Chamber Opera Orchestra and Noa Gruman&#x27;s Hellscore Choir, they are the first Israeli metal band to ever play a concert there. The show was attended by 2,400 people despite restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic. The show was livestreamed, and thus the band had footage of the whole concert. On December 1, 2023, the show was released as a music and video album, named &quot;A Heaven You May Create&quot;. On December 10, 2021, the band released a box set containing all six of their solo studio albums, and the bonus songs from them, entitled &quot;30 Years of Oriental Metal - Anniversary Album Collection&quot;, in tribute to their 30th anniversary.
