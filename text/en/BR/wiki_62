<text>Israeli literature is literature written by Israelis. Most works classed as Israeli literature are written in the Hebrew language, although some Israeli authors write in Yiddish, English, Arabic and Russian.

==History==
===Hebrew writers===
The foundations of modern Israel writing were laid by a group of literary pioneers from the Second Aliyah including Shmuel Yosef Agnon, the only Nobel Prize winner for literature in Hebrew and the only one for Israeli literature, Moshe Smilansky, Yosef Haim Brenner, David Shimoni, and Jacob Fichman. Until World War I, Hebrew literature was centered in Eastern Europe. After the war and the Russian Revolution many Hebrew writers found their way to Palestine, so that at the time Palestinian writing was essentially a continuation of the European tradition. In 1921, 70 writers met in Tel Aviv and founded the Hebrew Writers&#x27; Association. About this time the first literary periodicals made their appearance—&quot;Ha-Adamah&quot;, edited by Brenner, and &quot;Ma&#x27;abarot&quot;, edited by Fichman. The 1920 and 1930s witnessed the emergence of Palestine as the dominant center of Hebrew literary activity. Many of the pioneers of Hebrew literature were Zionists, and eventually made their way to Palestine. The great figures of the early part of the century—Bialik, Ahad Ha-Am, Tchernichovsky—all spent their last years in Tel Aviv, and although this was not the period of their greatest creativity, they exerted a great influence on younger Hebrew writers. 

Among the earliest modern Hebrew writers was a small minority of writers who were born in Palestine. This cadre includes Yitzhaq Shami and Yehuda Burla , Sepharadi Jews whose families migrated to Palestine in the 19th and 18th centuries, respectively. The writing of this group stands out for its authentic depiction of the Arab and Jewish population of Palestine, told from the vantage point of those who grew up in its midst.

The most important writers of the first generation, S.Y. Agnon and Haim Hazaz, were deeply rooted in their European background, and served as links between the classical writers of the early decades of the Hebrew revival and the Hebrew writers in Palestine during the following generations.

For the next generation of writers, the center of focus was Palestine, even when they were writing about other parts of the world. Their framework was the period of aliyah and, very often, life in the kibbutz. Among the outstanding names are Uri Zvi Greenberg and Avraham Shlonsky, who found in Palestine the antidote to the rootlessness of the Diaspora.

The third generation of writers emerged around the time of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Its key figures (S. Yizhar, Moshe Shamir, Hanoch Bartov, Haim Gouri, Benjamin Tammuz, Aharon Megged) were all sabras or had been brought to the country at an early age. Strong influences now came in from other countries, especially Western. A group called the &quot;Canaanites&quot; even sought to deny the connection between Israelis and Jews elsewhere. But after 1948, a feeling of emptiness and of searching for new values was leading to experiments in exploring the Jewish past. 

The subsequent generation of the 1960s (A. B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Natan Yonatan, Yoram Kaniuk, Yaakov Shabtai) has endeavoured to place Israeli culture within a world context and stresses not so much the unique aspects of Jewish life and Israel as the universal. This school of writers often identifies itself with the protest literature of other countries.

The following generation, writers who were born in the 1960s and 1970s and made their debut in the 1980s and 1990s, examined the basic questions of Jewish-Israeli existence by exposing the collective tensions in individual characters and fates. Notable writers from this era include Etgar Keret and Sayed Kashua.

===Yiddish writers===
Apart from Hebrew writers, there is considerable creative productivity in Israel in other languages, notably in Yiddish. Before World War II, Warsaw, Moscow, and New York were the main centers of Yiddish activity. In Palestine there was still a certain hostility to the Yiddish language, which was felt as a challenge to the Hebrew revival. However, with World War II the whole picture changed. The European centers were liquidated by Hitler and Stalin, and the New York center declined. Immigration brought many of the leading Yiddish writers to Israel. Here the internal attitude relaxed and became friendly, in view of the Holocaust in Europe, on the one hand, and the secure position attained by Hebrew, on the other. 

Yiddish writing in Israel can be marked by generations, similar to those in Hebrew literature. The first consisted of writers such as David Pinski and Sholem Asch, who passed their last years in Israel. The second generation, led by Abraham Sutzkever, started its career in Eastern Europe but continued in Israel. The third generation was centered on &quot;Young Israel&quot;, a modernist group of poets and prose writers, most of whom are kibbutz members, whose work has been influenced by the avant-garde schools of English and French writing.

Yiddish writing in Israel is concentrated on the European Holocaust (the leading writer on this is Ka-Tzetnik), and life among new immigrants. Yiddish authors in Israel are organized in a Yiddish authors&#x27; association.

===Arabic writers===
The presence of Arabic-language literature in Israeli society can be initially attributed to Emile Habibi, an Israeli-Palestinian writer and a communist politician. In 1992, he was awarded the Israel Prize for Arabic literature. A fervent communist, Habibi helped created the Israeli Communist Party and established &quot;Al-Ittihad&quot;, a communist daily Arabic language newspaper published in Haifa. Habibi&#x27;s works, while often a critique of Israeli society, are nevertheless part of Israeli culture.

==Publication of books in Israel==
By law, the Jewish National and University Library of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem receives two copies of each book published in Israel. In 2004 it reported that it received 6,436 new books. Most of them were published in Hebrew, and 89% those books published in Hebrew were original to the Hebrew language. Almost 8% of the 2004 crop were children&#x27;s books and another 4% were textbooks. According to the type of publisher, the books were 55% commercial, 14% self-published, 10% governmental, 7% educational, and 14% published by other types of organizations. The orthodox and ultra-orthodox sector was responsible for 21% of the total titles. 2017 figures show that 17% of books were Torah-related, 16% were literature and 14% children&#x27;s books.

<doc id="524319" wikidata="Q1603162" url="?curid=524319" title="Shake (software)">
<text>Shake is a discontinued image compositing package used in the post-production industry developed by Nothing Real for Windows and later acquired by Apple Inc. Shake was widely used in visual effects and digital compositing for film, video and commercials. Shake exposed its node graph architecture graphically. It enabled complex image processing sequences to be designed through the connection of effects &quot;nodes&quot; in a graphical workflow interface. This type of compositing interface allowed great flexibility, including the ability to modify the parameters of an earlier image processing step &quot;in context&quot; (while viewing the final composite). Many other compositing packages, such as Blender, Blackmagic Fusion, Nuke and Cineon, also used a similar node-based approach.

Shake 4 was available for Mac OS X and Linux. Support for Microsoft Windows and IRIX was discontinued in previous versions.

On July 30, 2009, Apple discontinued Shake. No direct product replacement was announced by Apple, but some features are now available in Final Cut Studio and Motion, such as the SmoothCam filter.

== History ==

In 1996, Arnaud Hervas and Allen Edwards founded Nothing Real, and released Shake 1.0 as a command-line tool for image processing to high-end visual effects facilities in early 1997.

Emmanuel Mogenet joined the R&amp;D as a senior developer in the summer of 1997 as Shake 2.0 was being rewritten with a full user interface. In the fall of 1997, Dan Candela (R&amp;D), Louis Cetorelli (head of support) and Peter Warner (designer/expert user) were added to the team. After initially working as a consultant in early 1998, Ron Brinkmann also joined in early 1998 as a product manager. This core group was all among the original Sony Imageworks employees.

Shake 2.0 was first shown at the 1998 NAB conference as an alpha demo with a minimal set of nodes, a node view and the player. A more complete beta version of Shake was shown at the 1998 SIGGRAPH conference.

Version 2 was released in early 1999 for Windows NT and IRIX, costing $9900 US per license, or $3900 for a render-only license. Over the next few years, Shake rapidly became the standard compositing software in the visual effects industry for feature films.

In 2002, Apple Computer acquired Nothing Real. A few months later, version 2.5 was released, introducing Mac OS X compatibility. To strengthen the Mac&#x27;s position in production studios, the Mac version held a price of , and users of the non-Mac operating systems were given the offer of doubling the number of licenses at no extra cost by migrating to Mac OS X. In 2003, version 3 of Shake was announced, which introduced the Qmaster software, discontinued support for Microsoft Windows, and allowed unlimited network render clients at no additional cost. A year later, the release of Shake 3.5 at the National Association of Broadcasters show saw the price drop to $2999 for Mac OS X and $4999 for Linux and IRIX.

In April 2005 Apple announced Shake 4 at a pre-NAB event. New features included 3D multi-plane compositing, 32-bit Keylight and Primatte keying, optical flow image processing (time-remapping and image stabilization), Final Cut Pro 5 integration and extensions to their open, extensible scripting language and SDK. Shake 4 had no IRIX version.

At the NAB event in April 2006, Apple announced that Shake 4.1 would be a Universal Binary version and would ship in May that year. It was actually released on June 20, 2006 and was rebranded as a companion for Final Cut Studio; as such, its price was dropped from $2999 to $499 for Mac OS X but remained the same for Linux. At the same time, Apple announced that they would end support for Shake. Rumor web sites claimed that Apple was working on a next-generation compositing application codenamed Phenomenon. Existing maintenance program subscribers had the option to license the Shake source code for .

Shake&#x27;s final release, version 4.1.1, was issued in 2008 to make it compatible with revised Apple 16-bit QuickTime codecs that used a different byte order (Endianness) than they had previously.

On July 30, 2009, Apple removed Shake from its online store and website. Shake had been officially been declared end of life status 3 years prior but continued being sold in the Apple Store for $499 until that time. The Shake website now redirects to Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro X website.

== Uses ==

Shake was used in such films as Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot;, as well as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films and &quot;Cloverfield&quot;. It was used by The Embassy to create a television advertisement for Citroën with a dancing car. Shake was used by Broadway Video for restoring the release of &quot;Saturday Night Live: The Complete First Season&quot; DVD box set. It was in use by CBS Digital for creating new visual effects for &quot;Star Trek Remastered&quot;.

Other major productions using Shake include the 2005 adaptation of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Poseidon&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, and for the restoration of &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

Shake was used for video post-production, but in this field Autodesk&#x27;s Flint, Flame, and Inferno systems were usually used in conjunction with Shake for a fast turnaround of projects. Shake&#x27;s historical strength had been the ability to work better with very high resolution formats such as 2K, 4K, and IMAX used in the motion picture industry.

<text>South Dublin () is a county in Ireland, within the province of Leinster and the Eastern and Midland Region. It is one of three successor counties to County Dublin, which was disestablished for administrative purposes in 1994. South Dublin County Council is the local authority for the county. The county contains both dense suburbs of Dublin and stretches of unpopulated mountains. In 2022 it had a population of 301,705, making it the fourth most populous county in the state.

==Geography and population==
South Dublin has an area of , making it the second-largest of the four local government areas in Dublin. It is bounded by Dublin City ( to the northeast), the River Liffey (separating it from Fingal to the north), Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown (to the east), County Kildare (to the west) and its hills adjoin the mountains of County Wicklow to the south.

The county town is Tallaght. Other important centres of population are Lucan and Clondalkin. Much of the county is heavily urbanised but small rural settlements exist in the southern and western parts. South Dublin&#x27;s population increased from 278,767 in 2016 to 301,075 in 2022, according to the latest census.

===Towns and villages===
Several urban areas in South Dublin County are also traditionally suburbs of Dublin city. For the purposes of planning and management, the County Council designates the status of towns, villages and suburbs in three tiers – town, district centre and local centre. In the 2022 development plan, the towns and district centres are listed as:
* Tallaght, the county seat and the location of The Square Shopping Centre which was opened in October 1990
* Clondalkin (&quot;to be facilitated and developed as a Town Centre ... including northward development&quot;)
* Lucan (with notes on the Liffey Valley Centre, and the developing Adamstown area – a future &quot;district centre&quot; – and a stated aim to avoid Lucan merging with Leixlip)
* and with a proposal to develop a Town Centre around the Liffey Valley Centre at Quarryvale
while the more local centres are noted in three groups:
* city suburbs including at least Rathfarnham, Ballyroan, Palmerstown, Terenure, Templeogue, Knocklyon, Firhouse, Ballycullen and Greenhills
* villages such as Rathcoole, Newcastle(-Lyons), and Saggart
* new neighbourhoods, some within bigger, older areas – including such as Kilnamanagh, Ballyowen, Finnstown, and, in development, Adamstown (mentioned in the county plan as an extension of Lucan).

==Terminology==

In Ireland, the usage of the word &quot;county&quot; nearly always comes before rather than after the county name; thus &quot;&quot;County&quot; Clare&quot; in Ireland as opposed to &quot;Clare &quot;County&quot;&quot; in Michigan, USA. In the case of those counties created after 1994, they often drop the word &quot;county&quot; entirely, or use it after the name; thus for example internet search engines show many more uses (on Irish sites) of &quot;South Dublin&quot; than of either &quot;County South Dublin&quot; or &quot;South Dublin County&quot;. The 2003 placenames order lists South Dublin without any modification.

==History==
In 1985, County Dublin was divided into three electoral counties: Dublin–Fingal, Dublin–Belgard, and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown. At the 1991 local election, the area of Dublin–Belgard was renamed as South Dublin. The name Belgard did have a historical association with the area, being the designation of one of the border fortresses of the Pale that existed in that area. It was altered due to a view that the name Belgard might create associations with areas of modern development in Tallaght that now also uses that name.

On 1 January 1994, under the provisions of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993, County Dublin ceased to exist, and was succeeded by the counties of Fingal, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and South Dublin in the areas of the electoral counties. The boundaries of South Dublin were finalised in 1993, to accommodate the M50 motorway.

Various organs of state use alternative subdivisions of Dublin for administrative reasons, for example, the Dublin postal codes.

==Local government and politics==
South Dublin County Council is the local authority for the county. It was established on 1 January 1994 with the establishment of the county. It is one of local authorities in County Dublin. The county is divided into seven local electoral areas: Clondalkin (7 councillors), Firhouse–Bohernabreena (5 councillors), Lucan (5 councillors), Rathfarnham–Templeogue (7 councillors), Tallaght Central (6 councillors), and Tallaght South (5 councillors).

The Dáil constituencies of Dublin Mid-West (4 seats) and Dublin South-West (5 seats) are wholly within South Dublin, and the constituency of Dublin South-Central is partially within South Dublin.

In 2015, South Dublin became part of the Eastern and Midland Region. South Dublin County Council sends three members to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly.

==Demographics==

==Symbols==
The heraldic crest for South Dublin has the inscription &quot;This We Hold in Trust&quot; in both English and Irish, while incorporating elements relating to the history, geography and present day infrastructure of the area.

==Sport==
The League of Ireland club Shamrock Rovers plays at Tallaght Stadium. The stadium hosted the 2009 FAI Cup final and the Setanta Sports Cup final in 2010 &amp; 2011.

The National Basketball Arena in Tallaght is the home venue for both the Ireland national basketball team and Ireland women&#x27;s national basketball team. The arena also hosts various National Cup &amp; League matches.

==Twinning==
South Dublin is twinned with the London Borough of Brent, United Kingdom.

<doc id="524323" wikidata="Q380272" url="?curid=524323" title="Ivan Reitman">
<text>Ivan Reitman (; October 27, 1946 – February 12, 2022) was a Canadian film director and producer. He was known for his comedy films, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. Reitman was the owner of The Montecito Picture Company, founded in 1998.

Films he directed include &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979), &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989), &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990), &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), &quot;Junior&quot; (1994) and &quot;Draft Day&quot; (2014). Reitman also served as producer for such films as &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978), &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981), &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996) and &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997).

==Early life==
Ivan Reitman was born in the town of Komárno, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), on October 27, 1946, the son of Klara (Raab) and Ladislav &quot;Leslie&quot; Reitman. Both of Reitman&#x27;s parents were Hungarian Jews; his mother survived the Auschwitz concentration camp, and his father was an underground resistance fighter. His family arrived in Canada as refugees when Reitman was four years old. Reitman attended Oakwood Collegiate in Toronto and was a member of the Twintone Four singing group. He attended McMaster University, receiving a Bachelor of Music in 1969. At McMaster he produced and directed many short films.

==Career==
Reitman&#x27;s first producing job was with the then-new station CITY-TV in Toronto. CITY was also the home of the first announcing job of his later friend and collaborator Dan Aykroyd. However, Reitman&#x27;s tenure at CITY was short and he was fired during his first year by station owner Moses Znaimer.

In Toronto, he produced the stage production &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1973) starring his university friend, magician Doug Henning, with a script by David Cronenberg and score by Howard Shore. This show evolved into the 1974 Broadway production &quot;The Magic Show&quot;, which ran for four and a half years at the Cort Theatre. Reitman and Henning also collaborated on the 1983 musical &quot;Merlin&quot;, for which Reitman was nominated for the Tony Awards for Best Musical (as a producer) and Best Direction of a Musical.

Reitman&#x27;s first commercial film ventures were as producer of two films for director David Cronenberg, &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rabid&quot; (1977). His big break came when he produced &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; in 1978 and directed &quot;Meatballs&quot; in 1979. From there, he directed and produced a number of comedies including &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989), &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990), &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), &quot;Junior&quot; (1994), &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; (1998), &quot;Evolution&quot; (2001), &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot; (2006), and &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2011).

In the early 1990s, Reitman began to direct fewer films, but increased his role as a producer and executive producer through his company, Northern Lights Entertainment. He helped to produce the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981), as well as the live-action films &quot;&quot; (1983), &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992), &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot; (1993), &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996), Howard Stern&#x27;s film &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997)

In 1998, Reitman (alongside former Universal Pictures chairman Tom Pollock) founded The Montecito Picture Company, a film production company located just south of Santa Barbara. In 2007, Reitman was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

He next produced the comedy &quot;I Love You, Man&quot; (2009), starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segel. Also in 2009, he produced the Academy Award-nominated film, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;, directed by his son Jason Reitman. Later, Reitman had planned to direct the erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot; (2009) but he couldn&#x27;t attract the cast he wanted so Reitman decided to only serve as a producer and asked Atom Egoyan to direct the film. &quot;Chloe&quot; has since enjoyed commercial success and became Egoyan&#x27;s biggest moneymaker ever.

In his final decade, Reitman also co-produced the biographical film &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, released on November 23, 2012, directed the 2014 sports drama &quot;Draft Day&quot;, starring Kevin Costner, and served as executive producer on 2021&#x27;s &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; as he had done for the first film.

In mid-January 2019, news of a new &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film, &quot;&quot;, came through with Ivan&#x27;s son Jason Reitman taking over as co-writer and director. Ivan remained producer, and stood in for the late Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler using visual effects. The film was released on November 19, 2021, marking his final film before his death. However, Reitman received a posthumous producer credit for the sequel to &quot;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&quot;, &quot;&quot;, which was released on March 22, 2024. The film is also dedicated to his memory.

===Unmade projects===
In the early 1980s, Tom Mankiewicz wrote a script for a film titled &quot;The Batman&quot;, with Reitman attached to direct. He planned to cast &quot;Meatballs&quot; star Bill Murray as Batman, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, William Holden as Commissioner James Gordon, and singer David Bowie as Joker. Following the deaths of Holden and Niven and rewrites of the script, Reitman left the project and was replaced by &quot;Gremlins&quot; director Joe Dante, but the film was never made.

In the mid-1980s, Reitman was in contention to direct &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot;, but departed from the project due to creative differences with star Chevy Chase.
In February 1996, it was reported that Reitman was planning a remake of &quot;Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot; at Universal with a script by Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris, as well as a potential Marx brothers feature, but neither materialized.

In April 1996, it was reported that Reitman was attached to produce, and possibly direct, a &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; film. However, three years later, he passed the project on to writer Jon Cohen and left for unknown reasons.

In 2000, Reitman along with Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, M. Night Shyamalan, Alan Parker, Tim Robbins, Terry Gilliam, Brad Silberling and Peter Weir were considered to direct &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; but the directing job was given to Chris Columbus instead.

In 2001, Reitman revealed he would direct MGM&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, with Mike Myers in the role of Inspector Clouseau. A 2006 iteration starred Steve Martin in the role instead.

In March 2007, &quot;New York&quot; magazine, citing no sources, stated that Sony Pictures Entertainment wanted to replace Reitman on &quot;Ghostbusters III&quot; with a younger director, but that Reitman&#x27;s original contract precluded this. In early 2010, it appeared as if Reitman would direct the film, but in September 2014, after Harold Ramis&#x27; death, Paul Feig was officially set to direct a new film, which was released in 2016 as a reboot of the franchise.

In March 2012, it was reported that a sequel to &quot;Twins&quot;, titled &quot;Triplets&quot;, was in the works, and that Reitman would co-produce the film. &quot;Deadline&quot; reported in September 2021 that Reitman would both direct and produce &quot;Triplets&quot; and that shooting was scheduled to begin in January 2022. The status of the film is unclear following Reitman&#x27;s death, with Arnold Schwarzenegger suggesting that Reitman&#x27;s son Jason &quot;stopped the project when his father died&quot; and that the younger Reitman &quot;never liked the idea.&quot;

In 2013, it was revealed that Reitman had plans to make a sequel to &quot;Evolution&quot;, but they never came to fruition.

In June 2016, it was reported that Reitman would produce a prospective animated series &quot;Ghostbusters: Ecto Force&quot;. In July 2017, Reitman stated that &quot;Ecto Force&quot; had been postponed to focus on an animated &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film that he would produce and co-direct alongside Fletcher Moules.

==Personal life and death==
Reitman married Geneviève Robert in 1976. He had two daughters and a son, Jason, who is a film director best known for his films &quot;Juno&quot;, &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;, &quot;Up in the Air&quot; and &quot;&quot;. His daughter Catherine is the creator, executive producer, writer and star of the CBC comedy series &quot;Workin&#x27; Moms&quot;. His other daughter, Caroline, is a nurse in San Diego, California. He and his French-Canadian wife, who converted to Judaism, brought up their children in the same tradition.

In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions as a director and producer, and for his promotion of the Canadian film and television industries&quot;. In April 2011, he received the Mayor&#x27;s Prize at his native city of Komárno, Slovakia. He received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

In 2014, he said &quot;I&#x27;ve always been something of a conservative-slash-libertarian.&quot; Reitman had previously appeared in the 2004 documentary, &quot;Rated R: Republicans in Hollywood&quot;.

Reitman died in his sleep at home in Montecito, California, on February 12, 2022, at the age of 75.

<text>Forest River Inc. is an American manufacturer of recreational vehicles, cargo trailers, utility trailers, pontoon boats, and buses.

==History==
Forest River, Inc. was founded in 1996 by Peter Liegl after purchasing certain assets of Cobra Industries, where CEO Peter Liegl worked from 1985 to 1993.
The company started by manufacturing tent campers, travel trailers, fifth wheels, and park models under the model lines Salem, Sierra, Sandpiper, Wildwood, Rockwood, Flagstaff, Summit, and Quailridge. Later that same year, they began producing cargo utility trailers as Cargo Mate.

In 1997, Forest River established a second cargo trailer line in 1997 called Continental Cargo.

In 1998, Forest River Launched Forest River Marine and began producing pontoon boats. That same year the company purchased certain assets of Firan Motorhomes to begin manufacturing class A motorhomes.

In 2000, Forest River acquired US Cargo, another manufacturer of utility trailers.

In 2001, Forest River entered the bus business through the acquisitions of Starcraft Bus and Glaval Bus.

In 2002, Rockport Commercial Vehicles, a brand of commercial vehicles and cargo trucks, was launched. That same year, the company acquired Vanguard Industries and the assets of Palomino.

In 2005, Forest River, Inc., was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway for an undisclosed price. In the same year, a new luxury coach brand, Elkhart Coach, was launched.

Forest River continued to expand with the acquisition of Rance Aluminum Fabrication and Priority One Financial Services in 2007.

The following year, the company acquired assets of Coachmen RV, a subsidiary of Coachmen Industries and a manufacturer of class A motorhomes, class C motorhomes, travel trailers, fifth wheels, tent campers and sport utility trailers.

Prime Time Manufacturing, which builds towable recreational vehicles, was established in 2009 followed by the revival of the Shasta product line in 2010, one of the intellectual properties of the Coachmen asset acquisition.

In 2011, Forest River acquired Dynamax Corporation, which builds luxury motorhomes (class C and super class C).

In 2014, the company expanded further with the addition of production facilities in Silverton, Oregon, Hemet, California, and White Pigeon, Michigan. That same year, the company acquired StarTrans Bus.

In 2016, Forest River Marine added the Trifecta Pontoon line.

In January 2017, Forest River launched its new line of luxury buses, Berkshire Coach. In June of the same year, Battisti Customs was acquired.

In May 2020, Forest River acquired the REV Group shuttle bus brands Champion, Federal Coach, World Trans, Krystal Coach, ElDorado, and Goshen Coach. In 2020, they closed the Federal Coach, Goshen Coach, Krystal Coach, and World Trans brands soon after acquisition.

In January 2024, Forest River acquired the school bus manufacturer Collins Bus from REV Group.

On November 18, 2024, Forest River, Inc. Founder and CEO Peter J. Liegl died. He is survived by his wife Sharon, daughter and two 2 grandchildren.

==Early life==
Pollak was born on October 30, 1957, in San Francisco, California. He is the younger son of Elaine Klein and Robert Pollak. He has one older brother, Craig, who lives in San Jose, California. He attended high school at Pioneer High School in San Jose. Pollak was raised in Reform Judaism.

==Career==

===Acting===

As an actor, Pollak&#x27;s roles include the best friend, family or confidant characters to the leading men, as he did in &quot;Ricochet&quot; (1991), &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993) and its sequel &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; (1995), &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), &quot;End of Days&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; (2001). However, he has also played a wide variety of parts, such as a comical brownie in &quot;Willow&quot; (1988), the philandering brother of Sarah Jessica Parker in &quot;Miami Rhapsody&quot; (1995), a criminal in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), a father in &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999), and a gangster in &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; (2000). His most substantial role to date was in &quot;Deterrence&quot; (1999), in which he played the main character, a vice president who must take over for a deceased President and deal with a nuclear crisis.

Pollak briefly hosted &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; in its first season. In December 2006, he played Karl Kreutzfeld in the Sci Fi Channel miniseries &quot;The Lost Room&quot;. Through 2008, he had a recurring role as a district attorney on the television series &quot;Shark&quot;. In March 2008, Pollak played himself in the web series &quot;The Writers Room&quot; on Crackle. In 2010, he portrayed Sheriff Tom Wagner in &quot;Choose&quot;.

In January 2010, Pollak was scheduled to host &quot;Our Little Genius&quot; on FOX, but the series was pulled before it could air on television. Pollak was then seen hosting &quot;Million Dollar Money Drop&quot; for FOX at the end of 2010; the show ran for 12 episodes.

In 2014, Pollak began a recurring role as Alvin Biletnikoff on the CBS sitcom &quot;Mom&quot;. His time on the show ended with the death of his character.

Starting in 2016, Pollak played the role of Marion in the FX series Better Things. His character was recurring throughout all five seasons.

In 2017, Pollak joined the cast of the Golden Globe–winning &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, an original series from Amazon, as Moishe Maisel, the main character&#x27;s father-in-law.

In 2019, Pollak appeared in five episodes of the fourth season on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Billions&quot;, as Douglas Mason.

===Directing===
Pollak&#x27;s directorial debut was on the horror web series &quot;Vamped Out&quot;, featured on the internet television platform Babelgum. Jason Antoon, Seana Kofoed, Samm Levine and Pollak all acted in the ensemble cast. The screenbook was based on a simple joke that Antoon and Pollak had between them. Pollak&#x27;s feature film directorial debut, the comedy documentary &quot;Misery Loves Comedy&quot;, premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The film sold North American rights to Tribeca Film, a US distribution company.

Pollak directed the comedy film &quot;The Late Bloomer&quot;, starring Johnny Simmons, which was released in 2016.

===Stand-up===
As a comedian, Pollak&#x27;s most famous work was his 1991 HBO special &quot;Stop with the Kicking&quot;, directed by fellow comedian David Steinberg and produced by comedy writer Martin Olson. In July 2010, &quot;The Littlest Suspect&quot;, his most recent comedy special, was aired on Showtime. Comedy Central named Pollak one of the Top 100 Comedians of All Time.

Celebrity impressions
===Podcasting===
In April 2009, Pollak partnered with Jason Calacanis on a weekly Internet talk show, &quot;Kevin Pollak&#x27;s Chat Show&quot;. Guests for the show include film directors Kevin Smith and Mike Binder, comedians Jimmy Pardo and Bill Burr, and actors Nia Vardalos, Illeana Douglas, Bryan Cranston, Dana Carvey, Billy West, John DiMaggio, Matthew Perry, Jon Hamm, Paul Rudd, Adam Carolla, Anthony Cumia, Jason Alexander, Seth MacFarlane, Tom Hanks, Larry David and Jason Lee.

The guest interviews are very in-depth and typically longer than an hour in duration, sometimes exceeding two hours. Common topics include the guests&#x27; childhoods, how they got into the business they are in (typically show business), how they got inspired to start certain creative endeavors, and unique experiences they have had while working. Viewers can interact via chat room during the show, and sometimes questions for the guest posed in the chat room are answered live.

The show&#x27;s self-described &quot;Paul Shaffer&quot; is actor Samm Levine.

Recurring segments and bits on the show include:
* &quot;The Larry King Game&quot;, which requires the guest to do a bad Larry King impression, reveal something about oneself (in the persona of Larry King) and then go to the phones and say a funny-sounding city
* &quot;Tweet Five&quot;, where Pollak reads the guest five questions from a Twitter user, usually in a this-or-that style
* &quot;Who Tweeted&quot;, in which a host (typically Samm Levine) reads tweets from the Twitter accounts of three female celebrities (the list of actresses varies, but typically includes Demi Moore (or, more recently, Justin Bieber), Tyra Banks, and Paris Hilton) and Pollak and his guest compete against each other game-show-style to guess who authored each tweet.
* &quot;You&#x27;re Not Buffering&quot;, in which Pollak freezes mid-statement during his interview as though the show has paused due to internet lag, but he&#x27;s actually still live. He then breaks his pause and says, &quot;You&#x27;re not buffering.&quot;

In 2012, Pollak began a new podcast called &quot;Talkin Walkin&quot; in which he spends an hour or more with a new guest in character as Christopher Walken. After three episodes, the show was rated in the top 5 of all comedy podcasts by iTunes.

He is the only person to ever go &quot;2 for 2&quot; (two exact matches), as a guest on the Sklar Brothers/Daniel Van Kirk podcast &quot;Dumb People Town&quot;, in the &quot;Guess the Age&quot; game. The feat was completed on the episode released on April 2, 2018.

In 2018, Pollak began hosting a comedy improvisation podcast called &quot;Alchemy This&quot;, on the network iHeartRadio. It features a regular cast of 5 members, Craig Cackowski, James Heaney, Chris Alvarado, Vanessa Ragland, and Joey Greer, as well as several guests.

===Poker===
Pollak is an avid poker player. He finished 134th out of 6,598 entrants in the 2012 World Series of Poker and won $52,718. He also hosts weekly home games with Hollywood celebrities.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Pollak married comedian Lucy Webb. They separated in 2005 and divorced in 2008.

<text>The Cape May County Park &amp; Zoo in the Cape May Court House section of Middle Township, New Jersey, provides free year-round admission to a collection of more than 550 animals representing 250 species in of exhibits. The zoo is located at 707 U.S. Route 9 North, in the center of Cape May County&#x27;s Central Park. Together, the zoo and the park cover about . The zoo began operation in 1978. Its principal exhibit areas are a &quot;African Savanna&quot;, a free-flight aviary, and a reptile collection. In addition to the Zoo and Park Central, there is also Park East, Park North and Park South.

The zoo is open every day except for Christmas, weather permitting. The hours of operation are from 10:00 am until 3:30 pm in the winter and 10:00 am until 4:30 pm in the summer. Time changes occur with daylight saving time. The zoo also has a train ride and carousel. The train is trackless and can take visitors all around the zoo. The carousel has zoo animals for riding seats unlike the traditional horses on most carousels.

Cape May County Zoological Society/ZooFriends, a 501(c)3 non-profit NJ corporation, is the official Support Organization of the Cape May County Park &amp; Zoo. Since 1986 the Society has continuously provided the private sector funding needed to develop new exhibits, improve facilities, purchase zoo equipment and make acquisitions for the animal collection. The Society makes significant contributions to conservation and endeavors to encourage the community&#x27;s interest and enjoyment of the Zoo.

==History==
In 1942, a area of wooded land, formerly a plantation owned by the Matthews family, was donated to Cape May County. The area later housed the 4-H fair. In 1967, the Cape May Park Commission was established to maintain the county&#x27;s parks. The land originally donated in 1942 became Park Central, which increased in size eventually to . In 1978, the Cape May County Park &amp; Zoo was created within Park Central.

In the February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard, the enclosure of the bald eagle habitat was destroyed by the heavy snow fall. It has since been rebuilt.

The Walter Trettin Snow Leopard Habitat was completed in 2016. In 2024, frequent visitor Charles Muller bequeathed 1.4 million dollars to zoo- the largest single donation in the zoo&#x27;s history.

==Reputation==
The zoo was voted the 13th best zoo in the world and the 5th best zoo in the United States in TripAdvisor&#x27;s Traveler&#x27;s Choice 2015. TripAdvisor also named the zoo the 3rd best in the nation in 2012.

==Conservation==

The zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and participates in a number of its species survival programs. In particular, a Mountain Bongo Antelope from the zoo&#x27;s collection was sent to the Mount Kenya World Heritage Site in 2004 to join a captive breeding population intended to reestablish a wild population in future generations.

On May 10, 2010, the Cape May County Zoo welcomed two snow leopard cubs born to parents Himani and Vijay. They are the first snow leopard cubs born at the zoo and the first cubs for mother ‘Himani’. Only eleven snow leopards were born and survived last year in the United States. The two male cubs, Kaba and Sabu are part of the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) Program. The mission of an AZA SSP Program is to cooperatively manage specific, and typically threatened or endangered species populations within AZA-accredited Zoos and Aquariums. Kaba now resides at the Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester and Sabu is at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.

<text>Silvia Farina-Elia (; born 27 April 1972) is a former professional tennis player from Italy. She won three WTA singles titles, reached the quarterfinals of the 2003 Wimbledon Championships and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 11 in May 2002. Farina-Elia won her first ITF title at Caltagirone in 1991 and her first WTA tournament at Strasbourg in 2001. She made her debut Grand Slam appearance at the 1991 French Open and was coached by husband Francesco Elia, whom she married September 1999.

==Career==
Farina-Elia made steady progression on the ITF circuit during the early 1990s and finished her first year in the top 100 in 1991. She completed her first victory over a top ten player (Gabriela Sabatini, Roland Garros) in 1994 and won her first doubles title the next year. In 1996, she represented Italy at the Atlanta Olympics. 1998 was considered her breakthrough year, reaching the final of four tournaments and in the process securing a place in the year end top 20. She was 26 at the time and thus considered a &quot;late bloomer&quot;. She only reached one singles final in 1999 but made a greater impact in doubles, winning three tournaments.

In 2001, Farina-Elia won a belated first WTA Tour title, at the Internationaux de Strasbourg. She ended the year No. 14, what was to be her best year end finish and played in the WTA Tour Championships of 2001 and 2002. She consolidated the Strasbourg win with two more wins at the tournament. In 2003, she achieved her best Grand Slam result at the unlikely venue of Wimbledon, home of her least favourite surface, losing to Kim Clijsters, 7–5, 0–6, 1–6 in the quarterfinals.

Farina-Elia represented Italy at nine Federation Cups and also at three Olympics.

On Monday 24 October 2005, she announced her retirement from the tour due a recurrence of a shoulder injury, saying, &quot;My body has given all it can.&quot;

==Personal life==
Farina-Elia began playing tennis aged 10; introduced to the sport by her mother, who played recreationally. Her parents are both insurance agents, as is her sister, Olga. Her brother, Enrico, restores furniture. She married Francesco Elia on 22 September 1999 and described the prospect of life after tennis as &quot;exciting&quot;.

<doc id="524350" wikidata="Q925995" url="?curid=524350" title="Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad">
<text>The Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad was a Class I railroad company in the United States, with its last headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Established in 1865 under the name Union Pacific Railroad (UP), Southern Branch, it came to serve an extensive rail network in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. In 1988, it merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad; today, it is part of UP.

In the 1890s, the MKT was commonly referred to as &quot;the K-T&quot;, because for a time it was the Kansas–Texas division of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and &quot;KT&quot; was its abbreviation in timetables as well as its stock exchange symbol. This soon evolved into the nickname &quot;the Katy&quot;.

The Katy was the first railroad to enter Texas from the north. Eventually, the Katy&#x27;s core system linked Parsons, Emporia, Fort Scott, Junction City, Olathe, and Kansas City, Kansas; Kansas City, Joplin, Columbia, McKittrick, Jefferson City, and St. Louis, Missouri; Tulsa, Wagoner; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Temple, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and Galveston, Texas. An additional mainline between Fort Worth and Salina, Kansas, was added in the 1980s after the collapse of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad; this line was operated as the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad (OKKT). Former Rock Island trackage rights acquired by the Katy also gave it access to Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa.

At the end of 1970, MKT operated of road and of track.

==History==

=== Formation and construction ===
The Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway was incorporated in May 1870 in Junction City, Kansas. The company received government land grants to build a supply railroad connecting the frontier military posts of Fort Riley, Fort Gibson, and Fort Scott; and eventually Fort Worth, as well as establishing connections with other railroads that served Fort Leavenworth, Fort Wallace and Fort Smith — but its broader ambitions were to connect Chicago and New Orleans. Upon its incorporation, the MK&amp;T acquired the Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch (est. 1865) and its of track in Kansas.

At the time of its incorporation, consolidations were also made with the Labette &amp; Sedalia Railway Co. and the Neosho Valley &amp; Holden Railway Co.; MK&amp;T also acquired the Tebo and Neosho Railroad, the St. Louis &amp; Santa Fe Railroad Co., and the Hannibal &amp; Central Missouri Railroad Co. Combined with the UP Southern Branch, these small, newly built railroads formed the foundation on which the Katy built. In the late 1890s, a subsidiary once called the Missouri-Kansas-Eastern railroad was established to run from existing MKT rails approaching Kansas City into St Louis via the Missouri River basin.

Congress had passed acts promising land grants to the first railroad to reach the Kansas border via the Neosho Valley. The Katy portion of the former UP Southern Branch, which had begun building from Fort Riley just north of Junction City, Kansas, was in a heated competition for the prize. On June 6, 1870, Katy workers laid the first rails across the Kansas border, winning the race. Congress&#x27; promised land grants were never made, as the courts overturned the grants because the land was in Indian Territory and was the property of the Indian tribes.

The Katy continued its push southward, laying track through the territory and reaching Texas in 1872, acquiring other small railroads while extending its reach to Dallas in 1886, Waco in 1888, Houston in April 1893, and to San Antonio in 1901.

When the Katy railroad reached Houston, its joint ownership of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad gave it immediate access to the Port of Galveston and its ocean-going shipping on the Gulf of Mexico.

=== Operations ===
A Katy train was robbed by the Dalton Gang on July 14, 1892, at Adair, Oklahoma, in what was then Indian Territory. The gang got away after a gun battle.

In 1896, as a publicity stunt set up by William Crush, the Katy crashed two locomotives head-on, pulling loaded trains, at a site that came to be known thereafter as Crush, Texas. The collision occurred before more than 40,000 spectators, three of whom died (and several were injured) by debris from the exploding boilers. Ragtime composer and pianist Scott Joplin, who was performing in the area at the time, commemorated the event in his piano piece, &quot;The Great Crush Collision March&quot; (which he dedicated to the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway).

The Katy acquired the Beaver, Meade and Englewood Railroad in 1931. This trackage, like the length between Altus and Forgan, was abandoned in January 1973.

From 1915 until January 4, 1959, the Katy, in a joint venture with the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway (popularly known as the &quot;Frisco&quot;), operated the &quot;Texas Special&quot; from St. Louis to Dallas, Ft. Worth, and San Antonio. It sported rail cars with names including &quot;Sam Houston&quot;, &quot;Stephen F. Austin&quot;, &quot;David Crockett&quot;, and &quot;James Bowie&quot; after prominent men of the state.

The city of Parsons was at the crossroads of the mainlines to St. Louis, Kansas City, and south to Oklahoma, so it was chosen as the first heavy repair shop site. In 1905 the shops were expanded with a new machine shop 860 by 153 feet in size, blacksmith shop, and storehouse. The primary freight car repair shops were located in Sedalia, Missouri. After extending the mainline into Texas, shops were established at the new center of the system in Denison, Texas, however, these were downgraded when a new shop site was built at Waco, Texas. The Waco Shops were established in 1910 in a section called Bellmead and renamed as the Warden Shops during World War II. Upon transitioning to diesel power, the Warden Shops were closed and diesel maintenance work was concentrated mainly at Parsons.

=== Merger and legacy ===

On August 12, 1988, the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac) and its owner, Union Pacific Corporation, purchased the Katy with approval from the Interstate Commerce Commission. The merging and restructuring of railroads during the 1980s had cost the Katy much overhead traffic, and it had been seeking a merger partner. On December 1, 1989, the Katy was merged into the MoPac, which is now part of the Union Pacific Railroad system.

In the &quot;rails to trails&quot; program, much of the Missouri track line has been adapted for use as the Katy Trail State Park, including a spur to Columbia, a Missouri State Park, which runs along the Missouri River for the major portion of its route. In downtown Dallas, a 3.5-mi-long section called the Katy Trail is being converted into a multiuse trail linking Southern Methodist University to the American Airlines Center.

In 1997, the segment linking Katy, Texas, to downtown Houston was abandoned, and stripped of rails soon after. The section between Katy and Interstate 610 was purchased by the Texas Department of Transportation in 1998 for the expansion of Katy Freeway. The line that went into Houston was purchased by the city&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department. In 2009, it was adapted and paved as the Heights Bike Trail.

In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Katy trail follows an old corridor of the railroad between the northwest edge of downtown Tulsa and its suburb of Sand Springs.

As part of a new heritage program, in July 2005, Union Pacific unveiled a new EMD SD70ACe locomotive, Union Pacific 1988, painted in traditional MKT colors.


===Passenger trains===
The Katy operated these named passenger trains:
(On its main line routes, trains originated in St. Louis or in Kansas City, linking in Parsons, KS, split in Denison, TX, with sections going via either through Dallas or Fort Worth, linking again in Waco, then heading south to either San Antonio or Houston.)
* Train numbers 1 and 2: The &quot;Texas Special&quot;:
** St. Louis, Missouri - San Antonio, Texas (March 4, 1917 – 1959) jointly with the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway), then

** Kansas City-Dallas (July 27, 1964 to June 30, 1965)
* Train numbers 3 and 4: &quot;Katy Limited&quot;
** Kansas City-Dallas, with sections to Oklahoma City, Fort Worth and San Antonio

<doc id="524362" wikidata="Q6106711" url="?curid=524362" title="J. P. Ricciardi">
<text>John Paul Ricciardi (born September 26, 1959) is an American Major League Baseball executive currently serving as a special advisor to the president of baseball operations with the San Francisco Giants. He previously served as the general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays from 2001 to 2009.

==Early life and career==
Ricciardi went to and played baseball for St. Peter&#x27;s/St. Peter-Marian High School in Worcester, Massachusetts, and then played for the Saint Leo University Lions from 1979 through 1980. He then spent two years as an infielder in the New York Mets minor league system, playing for the Mets&#x27; A-class league affiliates in Little Falls in 1980 and Shelby in 1981. He finished his playing career with a batting average below .200.

After the conclusion of his playing career, Ricciardi became a coach in the New York Yankees farm system in the early 1980s before joining the Oakland Athletics organization in 1986 as a minor league instructor and scout. By the early 1990s he had risen to the rank of East Coast scouting supervisor and later national crosschecker. Ricciardi made his break into the front office in 1996, when he became special assistant to Athletics general manager Sandy Alderson. Under new general manager Billy Beane, who was hired in 1997 and had been Ricciardi&#x27;s former teammate with the Little Falls Mets, his role became director of player personnel.

==Toronto Blue Jays==
Impressed by the success Ricciardi and Beane were having with the low-budget Athletics, the Toronto Blue Jays, who sought to cut payroll while becoming more competitive after their acquisition by Canadian media giant Rogers Communications, sought Ricciardi&#x27;s services after firing then-general manager Gord Ash. During his tenure, the Blue Jays never made the playoffs, coming closest in 2006, when they finished second in their division.

===2001-2004===
On November 14, 2001, Ricciardi was hired as general manager of the Blue Jays. He signed a five-year contract with Toronto after the 2002 season, which was extended to 2010 after the 2005 season.

After arriving in Toronto, one of Ricciardi&#x27;s first deals was to send hard-throwing reliever Billy Koch to the Athletics for third baseman Eric Hinske and pitcher Justin Miller. Over the next few years, Ricciardi would develop a reputation for coziness with his former team, making deals with Oakland for starting pitcher Cory Lidle in November 2002 and another starting pitcher, Ted Lilly, in November 2003. After a surprising 2003 campaign, which saw the emergence of Roy Halladay and Vernon Wells, the team suffered its worst season since 1980, in 2004, mainly due to injuries to key players such as Wells and star slugger Carlos Delgado. Delgado became a free agent in the off-season, and for financial reasons the Blue Jays did not seriously pursue re-signing him; the Florida Marlins eventually inked him to a contract. During the 2004 season, Ricciardi hired former Shelby teammate John Gibbons as the Blue Jays&#x27; new manager. Gibbons remained as Blue Jays&#x27; manager until being fired on June 20, 2008.

Ricciardi&#x27;s arrival in Toronto had been greeted with great optimism and enthusiasm after the team had suffered through several disappointing seasons. The enthusiasm steadily waned, however, as the team repeatedly failed to qualify for the postseason.

===2005===
Ricciardi was given more freedom to move after Blue Jays owner Ted Rogers expanded the team&#x27;s payroll to $210 million over three years prior to the 2005 season. In the 2005 MLB Draft, Ricciardi famously drafted Ricky Romero instead of Troy Tulowitzki, overruling the recommendations of his scouting staff. While Romero would have modest success, even being named to the 2011 MLB All-Star Game as a Blue Jay before eventually being released by the team, Tulowitzki would have the better career, winning multiple awards with the Colorado Rockies. Coincidentally, Tulowitzki would join the Blue Jays 10 years later in a trade executed by Riccardi&#x27;s successor, Alex Anthopoulos.

===2006===
After the 2005 season (in which the Blue Jays posted an 80–82 record), Ricciardi began working to improve Toronto&#x27;s pitching, signing free agent starter A. J. Burnett and closer B.J. Ryan. He also secured two big bats in first baseman Lyle Overbay and slugging third baseman Troy Glaus via the trade bloc, and signed Gold Glove-winning catcher Bengie Molina as well. The additions paid significant dividends for the team in 2006, as the Blue Jays finished second in the tough American League East with an 87–75 record. It was the first time Toronto had finished above third in the division since winning the 1993 World Series.

===2007===
Seeking to upgrade the everyday lineup as well, Ricciardi signed a two-year contract with experienced slugger and designated hitter Frank Thomas. However, due to his slow start in 2008, in which he batted just .167 with three home runs in his first 60 at-bats, Thomas was released in April of that year. Ricciardi also signed veteran shortstop Royce Clayton as a &quot;stopgap&quot; measure to shore up the middle infield for the 2007 season.

During spring training of 2007, B.J. Ryan was suffering from an injury that Ricciardi initially reported to be a result of a bad back. It was later revealed that it was not a back injury that he was suffering from at all, but rather a more severe elbow injury which subsequently required season ending Tommy John surgery. When asked why he was not more upfront about Ryan&#x27;s injury situation, Ricciardi responded by saying, &quot;They&#x27;re not lies if we know the truth.&quot;

===2008===
Despite the lack of hitting on his 2008 ball club, Ricciardi had assembled one of the more effective pitching staffs in Major League Baseball, bolstered by bullpen pick-ups such as Scott Downs, Brian Tallet, Jesse Carlson, and Shawn Camp. Over the season, the team had the best ERA in baseball at 3.49 and the bullpen ERA of 2.94. Early in the season, the Jays struggled, and the team fired manager John Gibbons, replacing him with former manager Cito Gaston. Toronto ended the season on a high note, finishing with a final record of 86 wins and 76 losses, the organization&#x27;s third-best showing since the 1993 season.

In the middle of June 2008, with the Jays in last place in the American League East, Ricciardi appeared on local Toronto sports radio station The FAN 590, in which he fielded questions from fans. One fan insisted that the Jays should actively seek to acquire Cincinnati Reds outfielder Adam Dunn, to which Ricciardi responded with very negative personal comments about Dunn&#x27;s passion for the game of baseball:

On June 24, 2008, Ricciardi told Toronto media that he received a personal phone call from Dunn and personally apologized for the ad-lib comments, a conversation Dunn vehemently refuted in an interview with MLB.com. Some again questioned Ricciardi&#x27;s trustworthiness, but Ricciardi said, &quot;All I know is the person I talked to said it was Adam Dunn. That&#x27;s quite a prank to pull.&quot;

===2009===
During Roy Halladay&#x27;s last home start of the 2009 season on September 25, a sign in the 500 level stating &quot;Fire JP!&quot; was hung over the railing. The sign was taken away by security at the bottom of the 2nd inning.

With two games remaining in what was a disappointing 2009 season, Ricciardi was fired on October 3, 2009. The day before Blue Jays players had gone public with criticism over Gaston&#x27;s managing style, and had asked for a meeting with team president Paul Beeston. His firing was widely expected. Ricciardi was replaced by assistant vice-president of baseball operations and assistant general manager, Alex Anthopoulos. Anthopoulos was eventually made the permanent general manager for the Jays.

==New York Mets==
Ricciardi joined the Mets front office in November 2010.

From 2011 to 2018 Ricciardi served as special assistant to former New York Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson. In July 2018 Alderson took a leave of absence from the Mets due to a recurrence of cancer. Ricciardi along with John Ricco and Omar Minaya assumed the responsibilities of general manager. Ricciardi and the Mets mutually parted ways after the 2018 season.

==San Francisco Giants==
In December 2018, Ricciardi was hired by the San Francisco Giants as a senior adviser of baseball operations.

==Television career==
On February 25, 2010, ESPN announced that Ricciardi would join &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; as an analyst after spending three decades in Major League Baseball.

Ricciardi left ESPN to join the Mets front office in November 2010.

==Personal life==
Ricciardi is married and lives with his family in West Boylston, Massachusetts. He and his wife Diane have two sons, Dante and Mariano, both of whom would play for their hometown Worcester Bravehearts. He also has a brother, Stephan Ricciardi, and sister, Mary Sivo.

Ricciardi&#x27;s son Dante was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 39th round of the 2015 MLB June Amateur Draft from Worcester Academy.

Ricciardi&#x27;s father, John, was an outstanding athlete at Worcester Boys&#x27; Trade High School. Johnny was named three-time, &quot;All City&quot; in baseball and won multiple batting crowns as a varsity third baseman. Johnny won the batting crown in the Worcester Parks Community League and also was one of the youngest athletes to play with the Norton Abrasives, a semi-pro team that competed against several barnstorming major league players. He signed a contract with the Boston Red Sox in 1948. He played professional baseball in Canada with Fredericton, New Brunswick, in the Can-Am League. He also played for the Worcester Hawks, a professional fast-pitch softball team. Johnny was later inducted into both the Worcester Public Schools Hall of Fame and the Sons of Italy of Worcester Hall of Fame.

Ricciardi is also a fan of the Boston Bruins, New England Patriots and Boston Celtics.

<text>Qamishli is a city in northeastern Syria on the Syria–Turkey border, adjoining the city of Nusaybin in Turkey. The Jaghjagh River flows through the city. With a 2004 census population of 184,231, it is the ninth most-populous city in Syria and the second-largest in Al-Hasakah Governorate after Al-Hasakah. Qamishli has traditionally been a Christian Assyrian majority city, but is now predominantly populated by Kurds with large numbers of Arabs and Assyrians and a smaller number of Armenians. It is northeast of Damascus.

The city is the administrative capital of the Qamishli District in Al-Hasakah Governorate, and the administrative center of Qamishli Subdistrict, consisting of 92 localities with a combined population of 232,095 in 2004. Qamishli was the de facto capital of the AANES, until it was moved to Ayn Issa.

==Etymology==
The city was initially a small village inhabited by Assyrians called (&quot;Bēṯ Zālīn&quot;) meaning &quot;House of Reeds&quot;. The modern name is the Turkish calque of this name. &quot;Kamış&quot; means &quot;reed&quot; and &quot;-lı&quot; suffix denotes &quot;place with&quot; in Turkish.

==History==

The city dates back to the 1920s, when a sizable amount of Assyrians, escaping the Assyrian genocide carried out by the Ottoman Empire, fled from northwestern Iran and southern Turkey and built a small town, under the French Mandate authorities, which they initially called Bet-Zalin. The city itself was officially founded as Qamishli in 1926 as a railway station on the Taurus railway. One of the most important funders of the early development projects in the city was Masoud Asfar, an Assyrian who survived the Massacres of Diyarbakır (1895) as a young child. Masoud, along with stepbrother, whose last name was Najjar, established the Asfar &amp; Najjar Corporation, a company that produced wheat in Qamishli. Throughout the 1920s–1940s, the Asfar &amp; Najjar Corporation funded hospitals, Assyrian schools, and churches throughout the city. At the same time, many Armenians and Assyrians, fleeing persecution in Iraq and Turkey, moved into the region. This was followed by the emigration of Kurds from Turkey, most of whom settled in the countryside and then began to move to the city. However, in the 1960s and until the late 1970s, when Assyrians still constituted two-thirds of the city&#x27;s population, the government of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party – Syria Region actively confiscated Assyrian farms, lands, and areas, causing an Assyrian exodus.

Qamishli is considered a center for both the Kurdish and the Assyrian ethnic groups in Syria. It was heavily settled by refugees from the Assyrian genocide. Assyrians were the majority in the city until the 1970s, when Kurds from the surrounding countryside moved into the city in numbers. Qamishli is renowned for its large Christmas parade, and Newroz and Kha b-Nisan festivals.

===21st century===
In March 2004, during a chaotic soccer match, the Qamishli riots began when visiting Arab fans from Deir ez-Zor started praising Saddam Hussein to taunt the Kurdish home fans. The riot expanded out of the stadium and weapons were used against people of Kurdish background. In the aftermath, at least 30 Kurds were killed as the Syrian security services took over the city.

In June 2005, thousands of Kurds demonstrated in Qamishli to protest the assassination of Sheikh Khaznawi, a Kurdish cleric in Syria, resulting in the death of one policeman and injury to four Kurdish civilians.

In March 2008, according to Human Rights Watch, three more Kurds were killed when Syrian security forces opened fire on people celebrating the spring festival of Newroz.

===Civil war===

With the civil war and the Rojava conflict from 2011, the city grew into a major political role, being the de facto capital of the AANES. Part of the city, as well as an area to the south which includes Qamishli Airport, remained under the administration of the Syrian government until the rebel offensive in December 2024. Unlike many Syrian cities, Qamishli has not seen large-scale fighting during the war, although it has been attacked by unknown perpetrators in 2015 and by Islamic State in 2016, as well as brief skirmishes between AANES and Syrian forces in 2016 and 2018. Qamishli is home to Chirkin prison, which houses detained Islamic State militants.

On 17 August 2020, Syrian forces reportedly clashed with US troops near Qamishli, which resulted in the death of one Syrian. Two other Syrian soldiers were said to have been injured during the clash, state media added.

In 2022, the Syrian government remained in control of a large part of the city centre as well as a substantial rural area to the south, including the airport, the border crossing, various government buildings, and many residential neighbourhoods. The government still organised the production and the distribution of the harvest in the southern countryside, and organised flights between Qamishli and other Syrian cities, as well as Beirut. However, most of the city was under the administration of the AANES.

The city came fully under Kurdish forces control in December 2024, when Syrian Government forces handed over control with little fighting.

==Climate==
The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Csa&quot; (Mediterranean climate; dry-summer subtropical climate). The summers tend to be dry and warm, with July being the hottest month of the year, while the winters are usually cold and wet, with January being the coldest month and having an average of 11 days of rain. In total, around 53 days of rain occur every year.

==Demographics==


In 1939, French mandate authorities reported the following population numbers for different ethnic/religious groups in Qamishli city centre.

Qamishli is an ethnically mixed city. Kurds make up a majority of the city&#x27;s population, which also has many Arabs, Assyrians, and Armenians.

==Religion==
===Muslims===
More than 80% of Qamishli&#x27;s inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. They are mainly Kurds, followed by Arabs.

===Christians===
The city is considered to be a Christian center in Syria, and was a Christian-majority city for much of its history.

In the 1930s it is estimated that out of the town&#x27;s population of 23,000 individuals, 20,000 of those were Christians.

Before the civil war, the Christian population of Qamishli was about 40,000, of whom 25,000 belonged to the Syriac Orthodox Church, the biggest church in the city. As of 2014 it was believed that half of all Christians had left the city.

Once a Christian-majority city, the rural migration to Qamishli has increased the Kurdish population of the city. In addition, since the PYD militia took control of the city in 2012 they carried out a Kurdification process touching all aspects of life, starting by changing the name of the city to Qamishlo, to cultural and social aspects of the city. The Christian and Arab population in the city were fiercely opposed to the PYD rule. Half the Christian population left by 2017 although no fighting happened in the city.

===Churches in the city===
* Syriac Orthodox Church of Saint Jacob of Nisibis (كنيسة القديس مار يعقوب النصيبيني للسريان الأرثوذكس)
* Syriac Orthodox Church of Our Lady (كنيسة السيده العذراء للسريان الأرثوذكس)

===Jews===
Historically, Qamishli was also home to a significant Jewish community. The origin of the Jews of Qamishli (unlike the Jews of Damascus and Aleppo who are a mixture of Sephardi Jews and Musta&#x27;arabi Jews) is the adjoining city of Nusaybin, on the other side of the Turkish-Syrian border. As after the foundation of Turkey in 1923, the major economic hubs were allocated to Turkey, the French Mandate authorities deemed it necessary to encourage the settlement or foundation of new villages and towns in the region. The current town was founded in 1926 by the French Mandate, which following encouraged the settlement of the population in Nusaybin, which is located just across the border. Within a few years, Qamishli was more populous than Nusaybin. The major part of the Christian, and also of the Jewish population from Nusaybin moved to Qamsihli. In the 1930s the Jewish population of Qamishli numbered 3,000. After the escalation of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 1947, the situation of the Jews of Qamishli deteriorated. The exodus of Jews from Syria peaked due to violence, such as the 1947 anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo. By 1963, the community had dwindled to 800, and after the Six-Day War it went down further to 150, of whom no one remain today.

<text>Jamie-Lynn Sigler (born May 15, 1981) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Meadow Soprano on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; from 1999 to 2007.

==Early life==
Sigler was born in Jericho, New York, on May 15, 1981, the daughter of Steve and Connie Sigler. She has two brothers, Adam and Brian. Her father was the founder of the Men&#x27;s Senior Baseball League. Sigler is of Greek-Jewish and Romanian-Jewish descent through her father, and of Cuban descent through her mother.

Sigler&#x27;s mother was raised Catholic but converted to Judaism upon marrying Sigler&#x27;s father. She attended Jericho High School and studied at the Cultural Arts Playhouse in Old Bethpage, New York.

==Career==
===Acting===
In 1997, Sigler was cast as Meadow Soprano, daughter of New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. When her manager first told her about auditioning for &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Sigler thought she would have to sing soprano. She continued to play the role through the series finale in 2007.

Sigler played the title role in &quot;Cinderella&quot; on tour and at The Theatre at Madison Square Garden in 2001. She then spent five months on Broadway from October 2002 through February 2003 playing Belle in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

In 2004, Sigler starred as &quot;Hollywood Madam&quot; Heidi Fleiss in the USA television movie &quot;Call Me: The Rise and Fall of Heidi Fleiss&quot;. In that same year, she had her first starring feature film role, &quot;Extreme Dating&quot;, an independent film. In 2005, Sigler starred in &quot;Love Wrecked&quot; and the following year in &quot;Homie Spumoni&quot;, when she played the role of Alli, the girlfriend of Renato/Leroy (Donald Faison) directed by Mike Cerron.

In 2008, Sigler appeared as herself in 13 episodes of the fifth and sixth season of the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot;. In the fifth season, she appeared as the love interest of the character Sal &#x27;Turtle&#x27; Assante, portrayed by Jerry Ferrara. She returned as a recurring guest star for season six of the series, after becoming Ferrara&#x27;s real-life girlfriend. On November 17, 2008, Sigler guest-starred as Jillian on the TV series &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; in the episode &quot;Woooo!&quot;. On the December 6, 2008, airing of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, she appeared as the checkout girl for the Digital Short music video &quot;Jizz in My Pants&quot; by The Lonely Island.

In 2009, Sigler starred in the psychological thriller film &quot;Beneath the Dark&quot;, which originally had a working title of &quot;Wake&quot;. The same year, she appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; in a five-episode arc. From 2012 to 2013, she appeared as a main character in the short-lived series &quot;Guys with Kids&quot;.

In 2019, Sigler appeared on the game show &quot;Pyramid&quot; alongside Steve Schirripa.

In 2020, Sigler starred as a featured player in the Adult Swim sitcom &quot;Beef House&quot;.

=== Other endeavors ===
In 2001, Sigler released a pop album called &quot;Here to Heaven&quot;, which featured the single &quot;Cry Baby.&quot; In 2012, she collaborated with Romeo Santos on the single &quot;You&quot; and appeared in its music video.

In 2002, Sigler co-authored her autobiography, &quot;Wise Girl: What I&#x27;ve Learned About Life, Love, and Loss&quot;.

In 2024, Sigler began a podcast with fellow actress Christina Applegate called &quot;MeSsy&quot; about their friendship based on both being diagnosed with MS.

==Personal life==
Sigler met Abraxas &quot;A.J.&quot; DiScala when she was 19, and he became her manager. They began dating shortly before she turned 21, and married on July 11, 2003. She subsequently changed her name to Jamie-Lynn DiScala. They separated in September 2005, and she resumed using her maiden name. She then dated restaurateur Scott Sartiano from 2006 to 2008.

In 2008, Sigler visited Israel through the Birthright Israel program and was moved by the trip, calling Israel &quot;one of the most beautiful, inspiring places [she&#x27;s] ever been to&quot;. She said that the trip gave her a greater understanding of her Jewish ancestry. Also in 2008, she began a relationship with actor Jerry Ferrara, whom she met while guest-starring on &quot;Entourage&quot; as a love interest of Ferrara&#x27;s character. They split up in 2009. She later dated football player Mark Sanchez.

In 2012, Sigler began dating baseball player Cutter Dykstra, the son of former Major League Baseball player Lenny Dykstra. The two became engaged on January 28, 2013, and announced in February 2013 that they were expecting their first child. Sigler gave birth to their first son on August 28, 2013. They were married in Palm Springs, California, on January 16, 2016. The couple had their second son on January 15, 2018.

In January 2016, Sigler revealed that she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was 20 years old. In 2000, while filming &quot;Campfire Stories&quot; in Hamburg, New Jersey, Sigler was paralyzed from the waist down for several days. This symptom turned out to be related to multiple sclerosis, but it was misdiagnosed as Lyme disease at the time. In 2023, Novartis hired Sigler to star in a TV commercial for their multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.

<text>University Radio Nottingham is the university radio station of the University of Nottingham, England, where it is part of the Students&#x27; Union. During term-time it broadcasts locally on University Park Campus on 1350 AM and worldwide via its website. It is run by student volunteers from the University of Nottingham.

==History==
URN was established from the university&#x27;s Radio Broadcasting Club, who, in the late 1970s had an hour&#x27;s slot on BBC Radio Nottingham. The station set up its first studio in the Cherry Tree buildings in 1978 and &quot;University Radio Nottingham&quot; started broadcasting to Hugh Stewart Hall and Cripps Hall of residence on 963 kHz (312m) in November 1979. Additional induction loops were set up over the next few years in other halls on campus. A fifth induction loop was installed on Sutton Bonington Campus in 1990, financed by their Guild.

In 1997, URN became one of the first radio stations to broadcast on the internet using the MP3 format. The station started broadcasting in the Ogg Vorbis format in 2002.

The station was one of the first to broadcast using an LPAM long-term restricted service licence to the whole of University Park on 1350AM in 2001.

In 2004, URN moved into new purpose build studios located in the university&#x27;s Portland Building. This was due to the demolition of the Cherry Tree buildings in 2003.
During the summer of 2012, the whole station was refitted to use a Studer digital system for audio routing and mixing.

In 2014 the station won the Student Radio Awards Best Station for a record breaking fifth year in a row and still holds the record for the most consecutive Best Station awards to this day.
In the summer of 2018, the station was relocated in the Students&#x27; Union Building to the new MediaZone. A brand new AoIP Studio was installed in spring 2020.

==Programming==
URN broadcasts twenty-four hours a day during Nottingham term time, with shows from 07:00 a.m to 3:00 a.m. The station is split into three sections: Daytime, After Dark, and Speech shows.
URN&#x27;s programming includes news-show The Pulse, feature-based speech programming, including sport and a large variety of other topics, daytime personality-based programming and evening specialist music shows. URN has a strong focus on Nottingham University students in all areas of its programming.

==Stunts==
Steve Doran accomplished a 40-hour continuous broadcast in November 2005 for Children in Need. In 2016, four teams walked 50 miles in under 24 hours in aid of Sport Relief.

During December 2020, presenters George Scotland and Damian Stephen attempted to get Russ Abbot&#x27;s novelty track &#x27;Atmosphere&#x27; to Christmas number 1, gaining endorsements from Paul Chuckle, Scott Muslin and Alistair Griffin. All proceeds were to go to charity with Abbot and his family fully behind the campaign.

==Famous alumni==
The former head of music for URN presented BBC 6 Music&#x27;s weekly chart show. Philippa Treverton-Jones graduated in 2007. She is now a TV producer.
Another former presenter on the station; Ian Chaloner is the current producer of the Greg James Show on BBC Radio 1. Katie Baxter was a previous member of URN and now produces the Happy Hour Podcast. Rob Howard was another former presents; he now hosts Capital (radio network) Breakfasts.

<text>Metacity 
was the default window manager used by the GNOME 2 desktop environment until it was replaced by Mutter in GNOME 3. It is still used by GNOME Flashback, a session for GNOME 3 that provides a similar user experience to the Gnome 2.x series sessions.

The development of Metacity was started by Havoc Pennington and it was released under the GNU General Public License. Before the introduction of Metacity in GNOME 2.2, GNOME used Enlightenment and then Sawfish as its window manager. Although Metacity was designed to integrate into the GNOME desktop, it does not require it to run, while GNOME can be used with different window managers provided that they support the part of the ICCCM specification that GNOME requires.

Metacity uses the GTK graphical widget toolkit to create its user interface components, which makes it themeable and makes it blend in with other GTK applications. Originally, Metacity used GTK 2 however as of version 3.12.0 it has been ported to GTK 3.

== Aim ==
Metacity&#x27;s focus is on simplicity and usability rather than novelties. Its author has characterized it as a &quot;Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like Cheerios.&quot; People in favour of Metacity say that it is aimed at new computer users who do not need the abundant options and functionality of Sawfish or Enlightenment. Havoc Pennington wrote an essay explaining why he wrote Metacity and simplified the GNOME desktop.

== Themes ==
Despite the incomplete state of Metacity theme development documentation, many themes have been written for Metacity. A popular theme engine is Clearlooks, which was the default in GNOME from version 2.12 until the release of GNOME 3 and GNOME Shell.

<doc id="524383" wikidata="Q146130" url="?curid=524383" title="Ranunculus">
<text>Ranunculus is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.

The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup &quot;Ranunculus repens&quot;, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup &quot;Ranunculus bulbosus&quot; and the much taller meadow buttercup &quot;Ranunculus acris&quot;. In ornamental gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.

Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.

The water crowfoots (&quot;Ranunculus&quot; subgenus &quot;Batrachium&quot;), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus &quot;Batrachium&quot; (from Greek , &quot;frog&quot;). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as &quot;R. aquatilis&quot;, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.

&quot;Ranunculus&quot; species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

== Distribution ==
Buttercups are found in both hemispheres on all continents aside from Antarctica, and are primarily found in temperate or montane habitats. They likely originated in northern Eurasia during the late Eocene or Oligocene and rapidly radiated up to the present, dispersing worldwide. Fossil evidence suggests that despite no longer occurring there, they inhabited Antarctica up to the mid-late Pliocene, even while glaciations were rapidly altering the landscape.

=== Fossil record ===
&quot;Ranunculus gailensis&quot; and &quot;Ranunculus tanaiticus&quot; seed fossils have been described from the Pliocene Borsoni Formation in the Rhön Mountains, central Germany. Achenes labelled &quot;Ranunculus cf. tachiroei&quot; is known from the Pliocene of the Hengduan Mountains of China. Indeterminate achenes have been found from Neogene strata from the Meyer Desert Formation biota in the Transantarctic Mountains, which appear to have inhabited a periglacial environment. The oldest potential fossil is from the Late Eocene (initially identified as Miocene) Florissant Formation of Colorado, identified by Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell in 1922.

== Description ==
=== Plant ===
Buttercups are mostly perennial, but occasionally annual or biennial, herbaceous, aquatic or terrestrial plants, often with leaves in a rosette at the base of the stem. In many perennial species runners are sent out that will develop new plants with roots and rosettes at the distanced nodes.

The leaves lack stipules, have petioles, are palmately veined, entire, more or less deeply incised, or compound, and leaflets or leaf segments may be very fine and linear in aquatic species.

===Flowers===
The hermaphrodite flowers are single or in a cyme, have usually five (but occasionally as few as three or as many as seven) sepals and usually, five yellow, greenish or white petals that are sometimes flushed with red, purple or pink (but the petals may be absent or have a different, sometimes much higher number).

At the base of each petal is usually one nectary gland that is naked or may be covered by a scale. Anthers may be few, but often many are arranged in a spiral, are yellow or sometimes white, and with yellow pollen. The sometimes few but mostly many green or yellow carpels are not fused and are also arranged in a spiral, mostly on a globe or dome-shaped receptacle.

==== Reflective petals ====
The petals of buttercups are often highly , especially in yellow species, owing to a special coloration mechanism: the petal&#x27;s upper surface is very smooth causing a mirror-like reflection. The flash aids in attracting pollinating insects and temperature regulation of the flower&#x27;s reproductive organs.

=== Fruit ===
The fruits (in this case called achenes) may be smooth or hairy, winged, nobby or have hooked spines.

==Naming==
The genus name &quot;Ranunculus&quot; is Late Latin for &quot;little frog&quot;, the diminutive of &quot;rana&quot;. This probably refers to many species being found near water, like frogs.

The common name &quot;buttercup&quot; may derive from a false belief that the plants give butter its characteristic yellow hue (in fact it is poisonous to cows and other livestock). A popular children&#x27;s game involves holding a buttercup up to the chin; a yellow reflection is supposed to indicate a fondness for butter. In ancient Rome, a species of buttercup was held to the skin by slaves attempting to remove forehead tattoos made by their owners.

In the interior of the Pacific Northwest of the United States, the buttercup is called &quot;Coyote&#x27;s eyes&quot;— in Nez Perce and in Sahaptin. In the legend, Coyote was tossing his eyes up in the air and catching them again when Eagle snatched them. Unable to see, Coyote made eyes from the buttercup.

==Splitting of the genus==
Molecular investigation of the genus has revealed that &quot;Ranunculus&quot; is not monophyletic with respect to a number of other recognized genera in the family—e.g. &quot;Ceratocephala&quot;, &quot;Halerpestes&quot;, &quot;Hamadryas&quot;, &quot;Laccopetalum&quot;, &quot;Myosurus&quot;, &quot;Oxygraphis&quot;, &quot;Paroxygraphis&quot; and &quot;Trautvetteria&quot;. A proposal to split &quot;Ranunculus&quot; into several genera has thus been published in a 2010 classification for the tribe Ranunculeae. The split (and often re-recognized) genera include &quot;Arcteranthis&quot; Greene, &quot;Beckwithia&quot; Jeps., &quot;Callianthemoides&quot; Tamura, &quot;Coptidium&quot; (Prantl) Beurl. ex Rydb., &quot;Cyrtorhyncha&quot; Nutt. ex Torr. &amp; A.Gray, &quot;Ficaria&quot; Guett., &quot;Krapfia&quot; DC., &quot;Kumlienia&quot; E. Greene and &quot;Peltocalathos&quot; Tamura. Not all taxonomists and users accept this splitting of the genus, and it can alternatively be treated in the broad sense.

==Pharmacological activity==
The most common uses of &quot;Ranunculus&quot; species in traditional medicines are as an antirheumatic, as a rubefacient, and to treat intermittent fever. The findings in some &quot;Ranunculus&quot; species of, for example, protoanemonin, anemonin, may justify the uses of these species against fever, rheumatism and rubefacient in Asian traditional medicines.

==Toxicity==
All &quot;Ranunculus&quot; (buttercup) species are poisonous when eaten fresh, but their acrid taste and the blistering of the mouth caused by their poison means they are usually left uneaten. Poisoning in livestock can occur where buttercups are abundant in overgrazed fields where little other edible plant growth is left, and the animals eat them out of desperation. Symptoms of poisoning include bloody diarrhea, excessive salivation, colic, and severe blistering of the mouth, mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract. When &quot;Ranunculus&quot; plants are handled, naturally occurring ranunculin is broken down to form protoanemonin, which is known to cause contact dermatitis in humans and care should therefore be exercised in extensive handling of the plants. The toxins are degraded by drying, so hay containing dried buttercups is safe.

<text>Lorraine Bracco (born October 2, 1954) is an American actress best known for her performance as psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi on the HBO crime drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999–2007) and for her breakthrough role portraying Karen Hill in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990). Bracco began her career modeling in France and appeared in Italian-language films in the 1980s. Her English-language debut came in &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot; (1987), which was followed by roles in &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987), &quot;Sing&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Dream Team&quot; (1989). She has been nominated for an Academy Award, four Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Early life==

Bracco was born on October 2, 1954, in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York. She is the daughter of Eileen (&quot;née&quot; Molyneux) and Salvatore S. Bracco Sr. She has a sister, actress Elizabeth Bracco, and a brother, Salvatore Jr. Her father was of Italian descent, while her mother was born in England, and had some French ancestry. Her parents met during World War II, marrying in Andover in 1946; Eileen came with Salvatore to the United States as a war bride. Bracco grew up in Hicksville, New York, on Long Island, from fourth grade, and graduated from Hicksville High School in 1972.

==Career==
=== 1974–1989: Rise to prominence ===
Bracco moved to France in 1974, where she became a fashion model for Jean-Paul Gaultier. She lived there for about a decade. While still modeling, Bracco was approached by Marc Camoletti, who offered her a major role in the film adaptation of one of his plays, &quot;Duos sur canapé&quot; (1979). Bracco did not imagine that she could be an actress, and initially refused. She eventually made the film, but found the experience &quot;boring&quot; and her performance &quot;terrible.&quot; Nevertheless, she played supporting roles in two other French films &quot;for the money.&quot;

After one of her friends suggested that she might enjoy acting if she took some training, she took seminars with John Strasberg. Although she loved the lessons, she was still unsure of her talents. During the 1980s, she worked as a disc jockey for Radio Luxembourg. She also appeared as Paul Guilfoyle&#x27;s hostage in the first season of the series &quot;Crime Story&quot;, in the episode &quot;Hide and Go Thief&quot;. Her sister Elizabeth played a coffee shop waitress in the series pilot.

Eventually, Italian director and novelist Lina Wertmüller gave Bracco a small part in the film &quot;Camorra&quot;. &quot;She dressed me up like an Italian woman of no means. A street woman clad in disheveled clothes, hair unkempt and all that, and threw me on the set. She was so creative. I mean, Lina accentuated my eyes with dark make-up, the way Sophia Loren used to appear in those epic roles in the &#x27;60s. And talk about talent. She&#x27;s so bright and perceptive. I mean, she&#x27;s just fantastic. And yes, I learned a lot from her. She&#x27;s a master of her profession, and I&#x27;ve been blessed not only with her, but also with so many masters,&quot; recounted Bracco to Daniel Simone during a 2007 interview. The experience inspired Bracco to pursue acting.

=== 1990–2007: &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot; ===
Bracco received her big career break when she was offered the role of mobster wife Karen Hill in the Martin Scorsese directed crime drama &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990). Her performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. She won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other films include &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987), &quot;Switch&quot; (1991), &quot;Medicine Man&quot; (1992), &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; (1992), &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995), &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (1995), and &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; (2001).
During the audition process for &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, David Chase wanted Bracco to audition for the lead female role of Carmela Soprano. However, Bracco had read the script and was drawn to the part of psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi as she wanted to try something different and felt that the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Bracco felt so strongly about her ability and desire to play the part that she arranged a meeting with Chase and talked him into letting her have a chance as Melfi. The role netted her three consecutive nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the Emmy Awards in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and at the Golden Globe awards for Best TV Actress in a Drama in 2000, 2001, and 2002. She lost out at the Emmys in 1999 and 2001, and at the Golden Globes in 2000 to her co-star Edie Falco. She was nominated again at the 2007 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and thus was pitted against her &quot;The Sopranos&quot; co-star Aida Turturro for the award.

=== 2008–present ===
Bracco is the owner of Bracco Wines, in association with Straight-Up Brands LLC. Her line of wines was featured on the Season 1 finale of Bravo&#x27;s show &quot;Top Chef&quot; in 2006. She appeared as a guest judge for the show&#x27;s two-episode finale and as a special judge on &quot;Top Chef: All-Stars&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;An Offer They Can&#x27;t Refuse&quot;, which featured Italian cuisine. Bracco also appeared on a season 6 episode of &quot;Throwdown! with Bobby Flay&quot;, as a guest judge for the ravioli throwdown. From 2010 to 2016, Bracco co-starred on the TNT crime drama &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; as Angela Rizzoli, mother of Jane Rizzoli, portrayed by Angie Harmon. She appeared in all 105 episodes of the series over its seven-season run. Beginning in 2016, Bracco had a recurring role as Toni on the Showtime comedy series &quot;Dice&quot;. In 2017–2018, she had a five-episode recurring role as Mayor Margaret Dutton in the CBS police drama series &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

Also in 2020, Bracco starred in the HGTV documentary television series &quot;My Big Italian Adventure&quot;. Shot in Sambuca di Sicilia, it chronicled her renovation of a 200-year-old house she purchased for €1 at Via Guglielmo Marconi. In 2022, Bracco worked in the Robert Zemeckis remake of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; where she voiced Sofia the Seagull. In 2023, Bracco starred in Waheed AlQawasmi&#x27;s debut film &quot;Jacir&quot; as Meryl, an opioid addicted next-door neighbor of a Syrian refugee living in poverty in Memphis, Tennessee, delivering an emotionally charged performance that was dubbed &quot;her best performance since &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;&quot;

==Personal life==
Bracco married Frenchman Daniel Guerard in 1979; they divorced in 1982. They have one daughter, actress Margaux Guerard.

Bracco was in a 12-year relationship with actor Harvey Keitel, whom she met while living in Paris. They have one daughter, Stella Keitel (born 1985). Bracco and Keitel fought a lengthy custody battle over Stella, resulting in Bracco&#x27;s depression and $2 million in legal fees.

Bracco&#x27;s second marriage was to actor Edward James Olmos in 1994; they divorced in 2002.

Bracco is a practitioner of Shotokan Karate. In 2015, she wrote a self help book, &quot;To the Fullest: The Clean Up Your Act Plan to Lose Weight, Rejuvenate, and Be the Best You Can Be&quot;.

<doc id="524385" wikidata="Q821701" url="?curid=524385" title="Megakaryocyte">
<text>A megakaryocyte () is a large bone marrow cell with a lobated nucleus that produces blood platelets (thrombocytes), which are necessary for normal clotting. In humans, megakaryocytes usually account for 1 out of 10,000 bone marrow cells, but can increase in number nearly 10-fold during the course of certain diseases. Owing to variations in combining forms and spelling, synonyms include megalokaryocyte and megacaryocyte.

==Structure==
In general, megakaryocytes are 10 to 15 times larger than a typical red blood cell, averaging 50–100 μm in diameter. During its maturation, the megakaryocyte grows in size and replicates its DNA without cytokinesis in a process called endomitosis. As a result, the nucleus of the megakaryocyte can become very large and lobulated, which, under a light microscope, can give the false impression that there are several nuclei. In some cases, the nucleus may contain up to 64N DNA, or 32 copies of the normal complement of DNA in a human cell.

The cytoplasm, just as the platelets that bud off from it, contains α-granules and dense bodies.

==Development==

The megakaryocyte develops through the following lineage:
:CFU-Meg (hematopoietic stem cell/hemocytoblast) → megakaryoblast → promegakaryocyte → megakaryocyte

Megakaryocytes are derived from hematopoietic stem cell precursor cells in the bone marrow. They are produced primarily by the liver, kidney, spleen, and bone marrow. These multipotent stem cells live in the marrow sinusoids and are capable of producing all types of blood cells depending on the signals they receive. The primary signal for megakaryocyte production is thrombopoietin (TPO). TPO is sufficient but not absolutely necessary for inducing differentiation of progenitor cells in the bone marrow towards a final megakaryocyte phenotype. Other molecular signals for megakaryocyte differentiation include GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, chemokines (SDF-1, FGF-4), and erythropoietin. 

The cell eventually reaches megakaryocyte stage and loses its ability to divide. However, it is still able to replicate its DNA and continue development, becoming polyploid. The cytoplasm continues to expand and the DNA amount can increase up to 64n in humans and 256n in mice. Many of the morphological features of megakaryocyte differentiation can be recapitulated in non-hematopoietic cells by the expression of Class VI β-tubulin (β6) and they provide a mechanistic basis for understanding these changes.

==Function==
===Platelet release===
Once the cell has completed differentiation and become a mature megakaryocyte, it begins the process of producing platelets. The maturation process occurs via endomitotic synchronous replication whereby the cytoplasmic volume enlarges as the number of chromosomes multiplies without cellular division. The cell ceases its growth at 4N, 8N or 16N, becomes granular, and begins to produce platelets. Thrombopoietin plays a role in inducing the megakaryocyte to form small proto-platelet processes. Platelets are held within these internal membranes within the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. There are two proposed mechanisms for platelet release. In one scenario, these proto-platelet processes break up explosively to become platelets. It is possible to visualize the spontaneous release of platelets using holotomographic live-cell imaging. Alternatively, the cell may form platelet ribbons into blood vessels. The ribbons are formed via pseudopodia and they are able to continuously emit platelets into circulation. In either scenario, each of these proto-platelet processes can give rise to 2000–5000 new platelets upon breakup. Overall, 2/3 of these newly produced platelets will remain in circulation while 1/3 will be sequestered by the spleen.

Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a 353-amino acid protein encoded on chromosome 3p27. TPO is primarily synthesized in the liver but can be made by kidneys, testes, brain, and even bone marrow stromal cells. It has high homology with erythropoietin. It is essential for the formation of an adequate quantity of platelets.

After budding off platelets, what remains is mainly the cell nucleus. This crosses the bone marrow barrier to the blood and is consumed in the lung by alveolar macrophages.

===Effects of cytokines===
Cytokines are signals used in the immune system for intercellular communication. There are many cytokines that affect megakaryocytes. Certain cytokines such as IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, LIF, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin all stimulate the maturation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells. Other signals such as PF4, CXCL5, CXCL7, and CCL5 inhibit platelet formation.

==Clinical significance==
Megakaryocytes are directly responsible for producing platelets, which are needed for the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot. There are several diseases that are directly attributable to abnormal megakaryocyte function or abnormal platelet function.

===Essential thrombocythemia===

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a disorder characterized by elevated numbers of circulating platelets. The disease occurs in 1–2 per 100,000 people. The 2016 WHO requirements for diagnosis include &gt; 450,000 platelets/μL of blood (normal 150,000–400,000) and characteristic findings in a bone marrow biopsy. Some of the consequences of having such high numbers of platelets include thrombosis or clots in blood vessels. Thrombi form more frequently in arteries than veins. It seems ironic that having platelet counts above 1,000,000 platelets/μL can lead to hemorrhagic events. Approximately half ET cases are due to a mutation in the JAK2 protein, a member of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This mutation induces an unregulated proliferative signal from the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor in the absence of TPO causing clonal expansion of bone marrow cells, especially megakaryocytes. There is a low risk of transformation to leukemia with this disorder. The primary treatment consists of anagrelide or hydroxyurea to lower platelet levels.

===Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia===
Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare inherited disorder. The primary manifestations are thrombocytopenia and megakaryocytopenia, for example low numbers of platelets and megakaryocytes. There is an absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow with no associated physical abnormalities. The cause for this disorder appears to be a mutation in the gene for the TPO receptor, &quot;c-mpl&quot;, despite high levels of serum TPO. In addition, there may be abnormalities with the central nervous system including the cerebrum and cerebellum that could cause symptoms. The primary treatment for CAMT is bone marrow transplantation.

Bone marrow/stem cell transplant is the only remedy for this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death until transplant has been completed, although this is not always the case.

There appears to be no generic resource for CAMT patients on the web and this is potentially due to the rarity of the disease.

==History==
 In 1906, James Homer Wright provided evidence that megakaryocytes give rise to blood platelets.

Kelemen first coined the term &quot;thrombopoietin&quot; to describe the humoral substance responsible for the production of platelets.

<doc id="524390" wikidata="Q1503538" url="?curid=524390" title="Mississippi River (Ontario)">
<text>The Mississippi River is a tributary of the Ottawa River in Eastern Ontario, Canada which has no relation with the Mississippi River in the United States. It is in length from its source at Mackavoy Lake, has a drainage area of , and has a mean discharge of . There are more than 250 lakes in the watershed.

Communities along the river include the village of Lanark, the towns of Carleton Place, Mississippi Mills (including towns of Almonte and Pakenham), and Galetta. Here it enters the Ottawa River.

==Etymology==
The origin of the river&#x27;s name is likely derived from its proximity to the nearby Kichisìpi, meaning &quot;Great River&quot; in Anicinàbemowin, the Algonquin language. The Misi-ziibi (Big River) is a minor tributary of Kichisìpi (Ottawa River) and the largest river in the area. Alternatively, the name may originate from &quot;Mazinaa[bikinigan]-ziibi&quot;, Algonquian for &#x27;[painted] image river&#x27;, referring to the pictographs found on Mazinaw Lake, though this is by no means proven. According to the Algonquins of Ontario, the river&#x27;s name is S&#x27;ni&#x27;miko&#x27;bi, or &quot;beaver creek.&quot;

==Description==
From its headwaters at Mackavoy Lake to its confluence at the Ottawa River near Fitzroy Harbour, the river drops in elevation. It begins on the Canadian Shield (mostly gneiss and marble), and then, after Carleton Place, flows through limestone and clay plains. At Carleton Place, there are rapids with limestone cliffs. This area supports the largest stand of hackberry trees in the region.

Most of the upper landscape is temperate deciduous forest dominated by sugar maple, American beech, and red oak. At one time, the forests had much more eastern hemlock, but this was logged out to produce bark for the tanning industry. Now, large hemlock stands are uncommon. Most forests are less than a century old.

The irregular terrain of the upper watershed is produced by the remnants of an ancient mountain chain, the Grenville Mountains, which arose on the supercontinent of Rodinia more than a billion years ago. These mountains have since been eroded to mostly gneiss and marble hills, with occasional outcrops of granite. Lower in the watershed, there are younger limestone rocks. Most of these are covered by clay deposited when this area was covered by the Champlain Sea.

Occasional large wetlands occur along the river. One of the largest is the Innisville Wetlands, a provincially significant wetland that is also designated an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. Another large wetland is the Appleton Silver Maple Swamp. These wetlands depend upon the seasonal cycles of the river. High water periods in the spring flood large areas creating wetland soils and large areas of marsh. As water levels slowly fall, conditions suitable for swamp forests occur. This natural seasonal alternation between high and lower water levels is essential for creating the natural diversity of wetlands along the river.

Upstream, in Lanark County, there are two sections of the river that are important for their plant communities. The first section of interest includes the east end of Dalhousie Lake and the swamp- and marsh-lined portion of the Mississippi River from the lake almost to Sheridans Rapids. Shallow lakes and adjacent river make up the provincially significant McCullochs Mud Lake Wetland. The second portion of interest is the rocky, rapid-filled section of the river from Sheridans Rapids down to just past Playfairville. Here there are small populations of unusual species including &quot;Parnassia glauca&quot; (Grass-of-parnassus), &quot;Platanthera flava&quot; (Tubercled Orchid) and &quot;Spiranthes lucida&quot; (Shining Ladies&#x27;-tresses).

Downstream, where the Mississippi enters the Ottawa River, there are several important shorelines and wetlands, including the Mississippi Snye, which has a rich aquatic flora over marble bedrock, and has recorded observations for the musk turtle.

The river originally powered textile mills. Today, it provides hydroelectric power. Such power dams, however, have all but eliminated American eels from the river. These eels were once an abundant source of food for aboriginal populations, as well as providing a source of food for great blue herons, otters, and other animals.

There are many important natural areas along the river. Purdon Conservation Area supports Canada&#x27;s largest native colony of showy lady slipper orchids, comprising about 16,000 plants. The Carleton Place Hackberry stand, and the Innisville Wetlands, have both been mentioned above. In drier areas, there are several provincially significant alvars, limestone plains with exposed rock and many rare plants. These include the Burnt Lands Alvar and the Panmure Alvar.

The river has a surprising diversity of turtles, including painted turtles, snapping turtles, Blanding&#x27;s turtles, musk turtles and map turtles. The last four are considered species at risk, probably because nesting beaches have been degraded by human settlement.

<doc id="524391" wikidata="Q1344639" url="?curid=524391" title="La Bottine Souriante">
<text>La Bottine Souriante (LBS) is a folk band from Canada. The band specializes in traditional Québécois music, often with a modern twist.

Formed in 1976 by Yves Lambert, Andre Marchand, and Mario Forest, they have toured extensively through Europe and North America. In 1990, the band integrated a four-piece horn section with traditional instruments, such as the accordion, fiddle, guitar, piano and double bass, in order to add an element of jazz to their music. In 1998, they contributed a song to the Canadian Celtic music compilation album by The Chieftains, &quot;Fire in the Kitchen&quot;.

The group&#x27;s name means &quot;the smiling boot&quot;, which refers to the appearance of a work boot with worn-out soles.

== Members ==
The line-up for LBS has changed numerous times (which is not unusual for folk groups), and its sound has evolved accordingly. The band started out with a very French Canadian feel with guitar, accordion and fiddle, but has expanded to include other styles and instruments. Although all of the founders have left the group, LBS continues to perform, and a new wave of young musicians joined the group in 2002.

LBS&#x27;s current line-up is:
* Éric Beaudry (podorythmie, guitar, bouzouki, mandolin, (solo) vocals) 2002-
* David Boulanger (violin, podorythmie, percussion, vocals) 2007-
* Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Ellis (bass trombone, tuba, percussion) 1990-
* Jean Fréchette (saxophone, flute, penny whistle, clarinet, percussion, vocals) 1990-
* Jean-François Gagnon-Branchaud (violin, (solo) vocals, podorythmie, guitar, mandolin) 2011-
* Mathieu Gagné (electric bass, acoustic bass guitar) 2022-
* Jocelyn Lapointe (trumpet, flugelhorn) 1993-
* Olivier Salazar (keyboards, piano) 2022-
* Sandy Silva (percussive dance) 1998-
* Timi Turmel (accordion, vocals) 2023-
* André Verreault (trombone) 1990-

Past members include:
* (accordion, jaw harp, harmonica, melodeon, (solo) vocals) 1976-2002 (founding member)

<doc id="524392" wikidata="Q706937" url="?curid=524392" title="Species diversity">
<text>Species diversity is the number of different species that are represented in a given community (a dataset). The effective number of species refers to the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the dataset of interest (where all species may not be equally abundant). Meanings of species diversity may include species richness, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, and/or species evenness. Species richness is a simple count of species. Taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity is the genetic relationship between different groups of species. Species evenness quantifies how equal the abundances of the species are.

==Calculation of diversity==

Species diversity in a dataset can be calculated by first taking the weighted average of species proportional abundances in the dataset, and then taking the inverse of this. The equation is:

:formula_1

The denominator equals mean proportional species abundance in the dataset as calculated with the weighted generalized mean with exponent &quot;q&quot; - 1. In the equation, &quot;S&quot; is the total number of species (species richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the &quot;i&quot;th species is formula_2. The proportional abundances themselves are used as weights.
The equation is often written in the equivalent form:

:formula_3

The value of &quot;q&quot; determines which mean is used. &quot;q&quot; = 0 corresponds to the weighted harmonic mean, which is 1/&quot;S&quot; because the formula_2 values cancel out, with the result that &quot;0&quot;&quot;D&quot; is equal to the number of species or species richness, &quot;S&quot;. &quot;q&quot; = 1 is undefined, except that the limit as &quot;q&quot; approaches 1 is well defined:

:formula_5
which is the exponential of the Shannon entropy.

&quot;q&quot; = 2 corresponds to the arithmetic mean. As &quot;q&quot; approaches infinity, the generalized mean approaches the maximum formula_2 value. In practice, &quot;q&quot; modifies species weighting, such that increasing &quot;q&quot; increases the weight given to the most abundant species, and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to reach mean proportional abundance. Consequently, large values of &quot;q&quot; lead to smaller species diversity than small values of &quot;q&quot; for the same dataset. If all species are equally abundant in the dataset, changing the value of &quot;q&quot; has no effect, but species diversity at any value of &quot;q&quot; equals species richness.

Negative values of &quot;q&quot; are not used, because then the effective number of species (diversity) would exceed the actual number of species (richness). As &quot;q&quot; approaches negative infinity, the generalized mean approaches the minimum formula_2 value. In many real datasets, the least abundant species is represented by a single individual, and then the effective number of species would equal the number of individuals in the dataset.

The same equation can be used to calculate the diversity in relation to any classification, not only species. If the individuals are classified into genera or functional types, formula_2 represents the proportional abundance of the &quot;i&quot;th genus or functional type, and &quot;q&quot;&quot;D&quot; equals genus diversity or functional type diversity, respectively.

==Diversity indices==

Often researchers have used the values given by one or more diversity indices to quantify species diversity. Such indices include species richness, the Shannon index, the Simpson index, and the complement of the Simpson index (also known as the Gini-Simpson index).

When interpreted in ecological terms, each one of these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness quantifies the actual rather than effective number of species. The Shannon index equals log(&quot;1&quot;&quot;D&quot;), that is, q approaching 1, and in practice quantifies the uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/&quot;2&quot;&quot;D&quot;, q = 2, and quantifies the probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species. The Gini-Simpson index equals 1 - 1/&quot;2&quot;&quot;D&quot; and quantifies the probability that the two randomly taken individuals represent different species.

==Sampling considerations==

Depending on the purposes of quantifying species diversity, the data set used for the calculations can be obtained in different ways. Although species diversity can be calculated for any data-set where individuals have been identified to species, meaningful ecological interpretations require that the dataset is appropriate for the questions at hand. In practice, the interest is usually in the species diversity of areas so large that not all individuals in them can be observed and identified to species, but a sample of the relevant individuals has to be obtained. Extrapolation from the sample to the underlying population of interest is not straightforward, because the species diversity of the available sample generally gives an underestimation of the species diversity in the entire population. Applying different sampling methods will lead to different sets of individuals being observed for the same area of interest, and the species diversity of each set may be different. When a new individual is added to a dataset, it may introduce a species that was not yet represented. How much this increases species diversity depends on the value of &quot;q&quot;: when &quot;q&quot; = 0, each new actual species causes species diversity to increase by one effective species, but when &quot;q&quot; is large, adding a rare species to a dataset has little effect on its species diversity.

In general, sets with many individuals can be expected to have higher species diversity than sets with fewer individuals. When species diversity values are compared among sets, sampling efforts need to be standardised in an appropriate way for the comparisons to yield ecologically meaningful results. Resampling methods can be used to bring samples of different sizes to a common footing. Species discovery curves and the number of species only represented by one or a few individuals can be used to help in estimating how representative the available sample is of the population from which it was drawn.

==Trends==

The observed species diversity is affected not only by the number of individuals but also by the heterogeneity of the sample. If individuals are drawn from different environmental conditions (or different habitats), the species diversity of the resulting set can be expected to be higher than if all individuals are drawn from a similar environment. Increasing the area sampled increases observed species diversity both because more individuals get included in the sample and because large areas are environmentally more heterogeneous than small areas.

Andrei Aleksandrovich Zhdanov ({{lang-rus|Андрей Александрович Жданов|p=ɐnˈdrʲej ɐlʲɪkˈsandrəvʲɪdʑ ˈʐdanəf|a=Ru-Андрей Жданов.ogg|links=yes}}; {{OldStyleDate|26 February|1896|14 February}} – 31 August 1948) was a Soviet politician. He was the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;propagandist-in-chief&quot; after the Second World War, and was responsible for developing the Soviet cultural policy, the Zhdanov Doctrine, which remained in effect until the death of Joseph Stalin. Zhdanov was considered Stalin&#x27;s most likely successor but died before him.

Zhdanov joined the Bolsheviks in 1915 and quickly rose through the party ranks. A close associate of Stalin, he became a secretary of the Central Committee in 1934, and later that year he was promoted to Leningrad party chief following the assassination of Sergei Kirov. He would go on to play a major role during the Great Purge. In 1939, he was promoted to full membership of the Politburo and as head of the Central Committee&#x27;s Propaganda Department. Zhdanov&#x27;s political standing was undermined during the Second World War due to his association with the Soviet–Finnish War and the failed Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Nevertheless, he played a leading role in the Soviet takeover of Estonia and defense of Leningrad.

After the war, Zhdanov was tasked by Stalin with directing cultural policy. His campaign, known as the &quot;Zhdanovshchina&quot;, was strictly enforced and led to the denouncement of artists including Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich. He also oversaw the creation of the Cominform in 1947. Initially considered the successor-in-waiting to Stalin, Zhdanov suffered from ill health and fell out of favour as a result of the Tito–Stalin split. He died of heart failure in 1948, resulting in a rise in the political fortunes of Georgy Malenkov.

== Early life ==
Zhdanov was born on {{OldStyleDate|26 February|1896|14 February}} in Mariupol, Mariupol uezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), where his father, Alexander Alekseevich Zhdanov (1860-1909), was a school inspector. His maternal grandfather was the former rector of the Moscow Theological Academy. He studied at the Moscow Commercial Institute. In 1914, he was drafted into the Russian army, graduated from an officers&#x27; school and served in the reserves. He joined the Bolsheviks in 1915. In 1917, he was chairman of the Shadrinsk committee of the Bolsheviks. He was a political commissar in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and was elected chairman of the Tver Governorate soviet in 1923. From 1924 to 1934, he was first secretary of the Nizhny Novgorod provincial party committee.

== Party secretary ==
Zhdanov&#x27;s first major promotion came at the end of the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in February 1934, when he was transferred to Moscow as a secretary of the Central Committee, responsible for ideology. In that capacity, he inserted his protégé, Aleksandr Shcherbakov, as secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers, and gave the opening address to the first Soviet Writers&#x27; Congress in August 1934. In his speech, as well as paying tribute to &quot;the guiding genius of our great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin&quot;, he repeated Stalin&#x27;s famous line that writers are &quot;engineers of human souls&quot;. He declared that the only good literature was political:

{{blockquote|Our Soviet literature is not afraid of the charge of being &quot;tendentious&quot;. Yes, Soviet literature is tendentious, for in an epoch of class struggle there is not and cannot be a literature which is not class literature, not tendentious, allegedly non-political.|}}

Zhdanov&#x27;s second great promotion followed the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, when he succeeded Kirov as first secretary of the Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) provincial party and was co-opted as a candidate member of the Politburo. Early in 1935, he and the head of the Leningrad NKVD, Leonid Zakovsky, organised the deportation of 11,702 so-called &quot;Leningrad aristocrats&quot;, people who had belonged to the nobility or the middle class before the revolution. They also hunted any current or former party members suspected of having supported Leon Trotsky or the former Leningrad party boss, Grigory Zinoviev.

=== Role in the Great Purge ===

Zhdanov has been described by J. Arch Getty as a key figure in the Great Purge, who advocated an approach that would make the party a vehicle for political education, ideological agitation and cadre preparation on a mass scale. Zhdanov&#x27;s encouragement of rank-and-file mobilisation helped create momentum for the Great Terror. Though somewhat less active than Vyacheslav Molotov, Joseph Stalin, Lazar Kaganovich and Kliment Voroshilov, Zhdanov was a major perpetrator of the Great Terror and personally approved 176 documented execution lists. 
On a holiday with Stalin in August 1936, he co-signed the telegram that brought about the dismissal of the head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda, who was accused, among other failings, of having impeded Zhdanov and Leonid Zakovsky in their purge of the Leningrad party organisation. During a Central Committee plenum in March 1937, Zhdanov announced that all provincial party secretaries were to be subject to re-election, a device that was used to remove them. Zhdanov was one of the few provincial party leaders in Russia to remain in post throughout the Great Purge.

In May 1937, he called leaders of the Leningrad party together to tell them that the long-time second secretary of the provincial party, Mikhail Chudov, and the former Mayor of Leningrad, Ivan Kodatsky, had been arrested. When an Old Bolshevik, Dora Lazurkina, went up to him afterwards to vouch for Kodatsky, Zhdanov warned her that such talk &quot;will end badly for you&quot;. She was arrested and survived 17 years in the gulag.

=== After the Great Purge ===
In September 1938, Zhdanov was appointed head of the reorganised Central Committee Directorate for Propaganda and Agitation, which brought all branches of the news media and arts under centralised party control. He was also Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from July 1938 to June 1947 and from 1938 he was on the military council of the Soviet Navy.

His rise coincided with the fall of Nikolai Yezhov. At the 18th Party Congress, Zhdanov noted that &quot;other means apart from repression&quot; could be used to enforce &quot;state and labour discipline&quot;. Zhdanov gave a key speech in which he proposed &quot;to abolish mass Party purges... now that the capitalist elements have been eliminated&quot;. He declared that the purges had been co-opted by &quot;hostile elements&quot; to &quot;persecute and ruin honest people&quot;.

At the conclusion of the Congress in March 1939, Zhdanov was promoted to full membership of the Politburo. He was still one of four secretaries of the Central Committee—the others being Stalin, Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev, and Georgy Malenkov—but Malenkov was not a member of the Politburo, which meant that Zhdanov had replaced Lazar Kaganovich as Stalin&#x27;s deputy in the party apparatus and appeared to be his most likely successor.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} 

On 29 June 1939, he had a signed article in &quot;Pravda&quot; in which he expressed what he called his &quot;personal&quot; view &quot;with which my friends do not agree&quot; that Britain and France did not seriously want a military alliance with the Soviet Union. In retrospect, it was the first public hint of the Soviets signing the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact three months later.

== Wartime ==

Zhdanov was very publicly associated with the decision to invade Finland in November 1939. In December, he signed the treaty between the Soviets and Finnish puppet government, headed by Otto Wille Kuusinen. As the Leningrad party boss and the official overseeing the navy, he had an interest in increasing the Soviet presence in the Baltic Sea at the expense of Finland, Estonia and Latvia. The final peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union was signed by Zhdanov on 12 March 1940.

In June 1940, Zhdanov was sent to Estonia to supervise the establishment of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and its annexation by the Soviet Union. In the United States House of Representatives&#x27; 1953–1954 Kersten Committee investigation Zhdanov was one of the accused charged with the 1940 Soviet aggression and forced incorporation of the Baltic states into the USSR.

The Finnish debacle weakened Zhdanov&#x27;s political standing. In September 1940 he was removed from direct control of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, which was taken over by Georgy Aleksandrov, an ally of his rival Malenkov. He was undermined further by the German invasion of the Soviet Union because he had been so publicly associated with the failed pact with Hitler. He was excluded from the State Defense Committee (GOKO), which directed the war effort and was initially controlled by Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria. According to the historian Anton Antonov-Ovseenko:

{{blockquote|Beria and Malenkov zealously sawed away at the chair holding Andrei Zhdanov, the first in line to succeed Stalin. They laid the groundwork for his transfer to the doomed city of Leningrad. No place was found for Zhdanov, Stalin&#x27;s favourite, even when the State Defence Committee was revamped.}}

Along with Georgy Zhukov, Zhdanov took a leading role during the Siege of Leningrad in the Second World War. In August 1941, he created a City Defence Council but was ordered by Stalin to disband it. When the siege was lifted, he was not officially given credit for saving the city.

After the Moscow Armistice between Finland and the Soviet Union was signed on 4 September 1944, Zhdanov directed the Allied Control Commission in Finland to the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947. That meant that he had to spend several months in Helsinki and relinquish his position as head of the Leningrad party organisation, which he had held for nine years, but he was able to leave it in the hands of his ally, Alexey Kuznetsov. In January 1945, when &quot;Pravda&quot; celebrated the lifting of the Siege of Leningrad, it emphasised that Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov had been dispatched to the city in 1941 and implied that they shared the credit with Zhdanov.

==Post-war ascendancy==
{{see also|Zhdanov Doctrine}}
Zhdanov made a political comeback during 1946, when his main rival, Malenkov, temporarily lost his position as a party secretary. For the next two years, he was delegated by Stalin to direct the Soviet Union&#x27;s cultural policy and to handle relations with the Eastern European states under or coming under communist control. He formulated what became known as the Zhdanov Doctrine (&quot;The only conflict that is possible in Soviet culture is the conflict between good and best&quot;). In December 1946, he launched the attack on Anna Akhmatova and Mikhail Zoshchenko, two writers living in Zhdanov&#x27;s former Leningrad fiefdom. He described Akhmatova, arguably then the greatest living Russian poet, as &quot;half nun, half whore&quot;. Zhdanov was the founding editor-in-chief of the Agitprop journal &quot;Kultura i zhizn&quot; which he held until 1948.

In 1947, he organised the Cominform, which was designed to coordinate and control the communist parties around the world. At a famous speech at Szklarska Poręba in September 1947, Zhdanov warned his fellow communists that the world was now split into two hostile camps and that the Cominform was needed to oppose the &quot;frank expansionist programme&quot; of the US.

In January 1948, he presided over a three-day conference in the Kremlin, to which more than 70 composers, musicians and music critics, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Aram Khachaturian, and Nikolai Myaskovsky were summoned to be lectured by Zhdanov on why they should avoid &quot;formalism&quot; in music. A persistent story is that Zhdanov played the piano during the conference to demonstrate how music should be written, but years later that story was furiously denied by Shostakovich, who attributed it to &quot;toadies&quot;. Zhdanov&#x27;s cultural policy rested on the Soviets&#x27; &quot;critically assimilating the cultural heritage of all nations and all times&quot; to &quot;take what was most inspiring&quot;.

== Fall from power and later life ==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2022}}

In June 1948, Stalin sent Zhdanov to the Cominform meeting in Bucharest. Its purpose was to condemn Yugoslavia, but Zhdanov took a more restrained line than his co-delegate and rival, Georgy Malenkov. That infuriated Stalin, who removed Zhdanov from all his posts and replaced him with Malenkov. Zhdanov was soon transferred to a sanatorium.

==Death==
{{see also|Doctors&#x27; plot}}
Zhdanov died on 31 August 1948 in Moscow of heart failure. It is possible that his death was the result of an intentional misdiagnosis. Zhdanov was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum and the Moscow Kremlin Wall.

== Legacy ==
{{see also|Leningrad Affair}}

Despite his bullying of Akhmatova, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and other cultural figures, and the apparent threat that the founding of Cominform posed to peace, Zhdanov is reckoned by many Soviet scholars to have been a &quot;moderate&quot; within the context of the post-war Stalinist regime. The worst events of Stalin&#x27;s final years, such as the rift with Yugoslavia, the Leningrad affair, the show trials in Bulgaria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and the anti-Semitic Doctors&#x27; plot all occurred after Zhdanov was dead. The Leningrad Affair was a brutal purge of Zhdanov&#x27;s former allies, notably Kuznetsov and Nikolai Voznesensky. The most notable survivor of that purge was future Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin.

In &quot;Khrushchev Remembers&quot;, Nikita Khrushchev recalled that Zhdanov was an alcoholic and that during his last days, Stalin would shout at him to stop drinking and insist on him drinking only fruit juice. Stalin had talked of Zhdanov being his successor, but Zhdanov&#x27;s ill health gave his rivals in the Politburo Lavrentiy Beria, Georgy Malenkov, and Nikita Khrushchev, an opportunity to undermine him. Stalin would later blame Zhdanov&#x27;s death on Kremlin doctors and &quot;Zionist&quot; conspirators.

==Zhdanovshchina==
Zhdanovshchina was the emphasis on purified communist ideology developed during the war by Zhdanov. It emerged from his arguments inside the party hierarchy opposing the pragmatist faction of Georgy Malenkov. Malenkov stressed the universal values of science and engineering, and proposed to promote the technological experts to the highest positions in the Soviet administrative elite. Zhdanov&#x27;s faction said proper ideology trumped science and called for prioritizing political education and ideological purity.

However, the technocrats had proven amazingly successful during the war in terms of engineering, industrial production, and the development of advanced munitions. Zhdanov sought to use the ideological purification of the party as a vehicle to restore the Kremlin&#x27;s political control over the provinces and the technocrats. He worried that the provincial party bosses and the heads of the economic ministries had achieved too high a degree of autonomy during the war, when the top leadership realized the urgent necessity of maximum mobilization of human and material resources. The highest priority in the post-war era was physical reconstruction after the massive wartime destruction.

The same argument that strengthened the technocrats continued to operate, and the united opposition of Malenkov, the technocrats, the provincial party bosses, and the key ministries doomed Zhdanov&#x27;s proposals. He therefore pivoted to devote his attention to purification of the arts and culture.

== Cultural standards ==
{{see also|Zhdanov Doctrine}}
Originating in 1946 and lasting until the late 1950s, Zhdanov&#x27;s ideological code, known as the Zhdanov Doctrine or Zhdanovism (&quot;zhdanovshchina&quot;), defined cultural production in the Soviet Union. Zhdanov intended to create a new philosophy of artistic creation valid for the entire world. His method reduced all of culture to a sort of chart, wherein a given symbol corresponded to a simple moral value.

Zhdanov and his associates further sought to eliminate foreign influence from Soviet art, proclaiming that &quot;incorrect art&quot; was an ideological diversion. This doctrine suggested that the world was split into two opposing camps, namely the &quot;imperialistic&quot;, led by the United States; and the &quot;democratic&quot;, led by the Soviet Union. The one sentence that came to define his doctrine was &quot;The only conflict that is possible in Soviet culture is the conflict between good and best&quot;.

This cultural policy became strictly enforced, censoring writers, artists and the intelligentsia, with punishment being applied for failing to conform to what was considered acceptable by Zhdanov&#x27;s standards. This policy officially ended in 1952, seen as having a negative impact on culture within the Soviet Union. The origins of this policy can be seen before 1946 when critics proposed (wrongly according to Zhdanov) that Russian classics had been influenced by famous foreign writers, but the policy came into effect specifically to target &quot;apolitical, &#x27;bourgeois&#x27;, individualistic works of the satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko and the poet Anna Akhmatova&quot;, respectively writing for the literary magazines &quot;Zvezda&quot; and &quot;Leningrad&quot;. On 20 February 1948, Zhdanovshchina shifted its focus towards anti-formalism, targeting composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich. That April, many of the persecuted composers were pressed into repenting for displaying formalism in their music in a special congress of the Union of Soviet Composers.

Zhdanov was the most openly cultured of the leadership group and his treatment of artists was mild by Soviet standards of the time. He even wrote a satirical sketch ridiculing the attack on modernism.

== Family ties ==
Zhdanov&#x27;s son Yuri (1919–2006) married Stalin&#x27;s daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva in 1949. She described the Zhdanov household as imbued with &quot;an inveterate spirit of bourgeois acquisitiveness ... There were trunkloads of possessions ... The place was presided over by Zinaida Zhdanova, the widow, and the ultimate embodiment of this mixture of Party bigotry and the complacency of the bourgeois woman.&quot; In 1952, Yuri Zhdanov was raised to membership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as head of its Department of Science and Culture, but was sacked very soon after Stalin&#x27;s death. That marriage ended in divorce in 1952. They had one daughter, Yekaterina.

<text>Ecosystem diversity deals with the variations in ecosystems within a geographical location and its overall impact on human existence and the environment.

Ecosystem diversity addresses the combined characteristics of biotic properties which are living organisms (biodiversity) and abiotic properties such as nonliving things like water or soil (geodiversity). It is a variation in the ecosystems found in a region or the variation in ecosystems over the whole planet. Ecological diversity includes the variation in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Ecological diversity can also take into account the variation in the complexity of a biological community, including the number of different niches, the number of and other ecological processes. An example of ecological diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems, such as deserts, forests, grasslands, wetlands and oceans. Ecological diversity is the largest scale of biodiversity, and within each ecosystem, there is a great deal of both species and genetic diversity.

== Impact ==

Diversity in the ecosystem is significant to human existence for a variety of reasons. Ecosystem diversity boosts the availability of oxygen via the process of photosynthesis amongst plant organisms domiciled in the habitat. Diversity in an aquatic environment helps in the purification of water by plant varieties for use by humans. Diversity increases plant varieties which serves as a good source for medicines and herbs for human use. A lack of diversity in the ecosystem produces an opposite result.

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecosystems that are rich in diversity are:
* Deserts
* Forests
* Large marine ecosystems
* Marine ecosystems
* Old-growth forests
* Rainforests
* Tundra
* Coral reefs
* Marine

== Ecosystem diversity as a result of evolutionary pressure ==
Ecological diversity around the world can be directly linked to the evolutionary and selective pressures that constrain the diversity outcome of the ecosystems within different niches. Tundras, Rainforests, coral reefs and deciduous forests all are formed as a result of evolutionary pressures. Even seemingly small evolutionary interactions can have large impacts on the diversity of the ecosystems throughout the world. One of the best studied cases of this is of the honeybee&#x27;s interaction with angiosperms on every continent in the world except Antarctica.

In 2010, Robert Brodschneider and Karl Crailsheim conducted a study on the health and nutrition in honeybee colonies. The study focused on overall colony health, adult nutrition, and larva nutrition as a function of the effect of pesticides, monocultures and genetically modified crops to see if the anthropogenically created problems can have an effect pollination levels. The results indicate that human activity does have a role in the destruction of the fitness of the bee colony. The extinction or near extinction of these pollinators would result in many plants that feed humans on a wide scale needing alternative pollination methods. Crop pollinating insects are worth annually $14.6 billion to the US economy and the cost to hand pollinate over insect pollination is estimated to cost $5,715-$7,135 more per hectare. Not only will there be a cost increase but also an decrease in colony fitness, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity, which studies have shown has a direct link to the long-term survival of the honeybee colonies.

According to a study, there are over 50 plants that are dependent on bee pollination, many of these being key staples to feeding the world. Another study conducted states that a lack of plant diversity will lead to a decline in the bee population fitness, and a low bee colony fitness has impacts on the fitness of plant ecosystem diversity. By allowing for bee pollination and working to reduce anthropogenically harmful footprints, bee pollination can increase genetic diversity of flora growth and create a unique ecosystem that is highly diverse and can provide a habitat and niche for many other organisms to thrive. Due to the evolutionary pressures of bees being located on six out of seven continents, there can be no denying the impact of pollinators on the ecosystem diversity. The pollen collected by the bees is harvested and used as an energy source for wintertime; this act of collecting pollen from local plants also has a more important effect of facilitating the movement of genes between organisms.

The new evolutionary pressures that are largely anthropogenically catalyzed can potentially cause widespread collapse of ecosystems. In the north Atlantic Sea, a study was conducted that followed the effects of the human interaction on surrounding ocean habitats. They found that there was no habitat or trophic level that in some way was affected negatively by human interaction, and that much of the diversity of life was being stunted as a result.

<text>Elston Gene Howard (February 23, 1929 – December 14, 1980) was an American professional baseball player who was a catcher and a left fielder. During a 14-year baseball career, he played in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball from 1948 through 1968, primarily for the New York Yankees. A 12-time All-Star, he also played for the Kansas City Monarchs and the Boston Red Sox. Howard served on the Yankees&#x27; coaching staff from 1969 to 1979.

In 1955, he was the first African American player on the Yankees roster, eight years after Jackie Robinson had broken MLB&#x27;s color barrier in 1947. Howard was named the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player for the 1963 pennant winners after finishing third in the league in slugging average and fifth in home runs, becoming the first black player in AL history to win the honor. He won Gold Glove Awards in 1963 and 1964, in the latter season setting AL records for putouts and total chances in a season. His lifetime fielding percentage of .993 as a catcher was a major league record from 1967 to 1973, and he retired among the AL career leaders in putouts (7th, 6,447) and total chances (9th, 6,977).

==Early life==
Elston Gene Howard was born on February 23, 1929, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Travis Howard and Emaline Hill, a nurse at a local hospital. When he was six years old, his parents divorced and his mother remarried. Howard was a standout athlete at Vashon High School.

==Professional career==
===Negro leagues===
In 1948, nineteen-year-old Howard turned down college football scholarship offers from Illinois, Michigan, and Michigan State and instead signed to play professional baseball for $500 a month with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League under manager Buck O&#x27;Neil. He was an outfielder for three seasons and in 1950 roomed with Ernie Banks.

===Minor leagues===
The Yankees signed Howard on July 19, 1950, after purchasing his contract along with the contract of Frank Barnes. They were assigned to the Muskegon Clippers, the Yankees&#x27; farm team in the Central League. Howard missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons due to his military service in the U.S. Army.

In 1953, Howard played for the Kansas City Blues of the Class AAA American Association. The next year, the Yankees invited Howard to spring training and converted him into a catcher, despite the presence of Yogi Berra as the Yankees&#x27; starting catcher.

He played with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class AAA International League in 1954, where he led the league in triples, with 16, to go along with 22 home runs, 109 runs batted in and a .330 average, winning the league&#x27;s MVP award.

The Yankees assigned Bill Dickey to work with Howard in order to develop his catching skills.

===New York Yankees (1955–1967)===
====1950s====

Howard made the Yankees&#x27; Major League roster at the start of the 1955 season. On April 14, 1955 (the second game of the season), Howard made his major league debut when he entered the game in the sixth inning as a left fielder. Howard hit a single in his only plate appearance of the day. He became the first black player to play for the Yankees. Howard was known to be very slow afoot. When Howard first came to the Yankees, manager Casey Stengel referred to him as &quot;Eightball&quot;. Howard made his first start on April 28, because it was difficult to find room for Howard in the lineup. Berra won his third MVP award in 1955, and Mickey Mantle and Hank Bauer were solid outfield regulars. Stengel used Howard as a backup catcher and occasional outfielder; he competed for playing time with Norm Siebern and Enos Slaughter. He hit .290 with 10 home runs and 43 runs batted in (RBIs) in 97 games played for the season.

In the 1955 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, Howard hit a home run off Don Newcombe in his first at bat in the second inning of Game 1. The round tripper tied the game at 2-2 and the Yankees went on to win the game, 6–5. Howard&#x27;s ground ball out to Pee Wee Reese in Game 7 ended the Series; it was the first time in six meetings the Yankees had lost to Brooklyn. In the 1956 World Series against Brooklyn he played only in Game 7, but his solo home run off Newcombe in the fourth inning was one of four Yankee HRs in Johnny Kucks&#x27; 9–0 victory. Against the Milwaukee Braves in the 1957 World Series, his three-run homer off Warren Spahn with two outs in the ninth inning of Game 4 tied the score 4-4, though Milwaukee won 7–5 in the 10th inning on a Eddie Mathews’ walk-off home run. As the Yankees again met the Braves in the 1958 World Series, his impact did not become notable until Game 5, when he caught Red Schoendienst&#x27;s sinking fly ball in the sixth inning and made a throw to catch Bill Bruton off first base for a double play, preserving a 1–0 lead. In Game 6, he threw Andy Pafko out at the plate in the second inning, and singled and scored with two out in the tenth inning for a 4-2 Yankee lead; the run proved decisive, as the Braves came back to score once in the bottom of the frame. In Game 7, his two-out RBI single scored Berra for a 3–2 lead in the eighth inning, with New York going on to a 6–2 win, completing only the second comeback by a team from a 3–1 deficit in a Series. Howard was later given the Babe Ruth Award, presented by the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, as the top player in the Series, although the World Series MVP Award was won by teammate Bob Turley.

By 1959, Howard was often playing at first base in order to remain in the lineup. Despite not finding a regular position yet, he was first selected to the All-Star team in 1957, the first of nine consecutive years through 1965 in which he made the squad; he would appear in six of the games (1960–1964), including both 1961 contests.

====1960s====
In 1960, Howard took over the majority of Berra&#x27;s catching duties, although his .245 batting average was his lowest to date. The Yankees met the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series, and Howard&#x27;s two-run pinch-hit homer off Roy Face in the ninth inning of Game 1 brought the Yankees within two runs, though they lost 6–4. Howard hit .462 in the Series, but did not play in Game 7 after being hit on the hand by a pitch in the second inning of Game 6, and could only watch as the Pirates won the Series, 10–9, on Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s home run leading off the bottom of the ninth.
In 1961, he raised his average 103 points to a career-best .348 mark on a team that featured Roger Maris&#x27;s record 61-home run season; Howard also enjoyed his first 20-homer campaign, along with 77 RBI, as the Yankees set a major league record with 240 HRs. He finished tenth in the MVP voting that year, won by Maris. Meeting the Cincinnati Reds in the 1961 Series, he and Bill Skowron had solo home runs in the 2-0 Game 1 victory, and he scored three runs in the final 13–5 win in Game 5. He followed up with a 1962 season in which he batted .279 with a career-best 91 RBI, again hitting over 20 homers, and collecting eight RBI in an August 19 game in Kansas City which the Yankees won, 21–7. Although Howard batted only .143 in the 1962 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, the Yankees won in seven games.

In his 1963 MVP season, he batted .287 with 28 home runs, 85 RBI and a .528 slugging average, also winning his first Gold Glove. The Yankees were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1963 Series, though Howard hit .333 and drove in the only Yankees run of Game 2. He batted .313 (just ten points behind batting champion Tony Oliva) with 84 RBI in 1964, again winning the Gold Glove and placing third in the MVP vote as Berra took over Ralph Houk&#x27;s post as manager. His totals of 939 putouts and 1,008 total chances broke the AL records of 872 and 963 set by Earl Battey with the 1962 Minnesota Twins; Bill Freehan would top Howard&#x27;s marks with the 1967 Detroit Tigers. Howard also led the AL in fielding average in 1964 with a .998 mark. Playing in his ninth World Series in ten years against the St. Louis Cardinals, he batted .292, though the Yankees were overcome in seven games; he tied a Series record with three passed balls, including two in the 9-5 Game 1 loss. In 1965, Howard injured his elbow during spring training. He played in four games through April, then had surgery, missing five more weeks.

Howard struggled in 1967. He backed up Jake Gibbs and batted only .198 through the start of August.

===Boston Red Sox (1967–1968)===
On August 3, 1967, Howard was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Pete Magrini and a player to be named later, Ron Klimkowski. Though he batted only .147 for Boston, he was effective in handling the pitchers; teammate Tony Conigliaro noted, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever saw a pitcher shake off one of his signs. They had too much respect for him.&quot; In 1967, Howard also took over Sherm Lollar&#x27;s major-league record for career fielding average; Freehan moved ahead of him in 1973.

One of Howard&#x27;s highlights during his time with the Red Sox occurred on August 27, 1967, when the Chicago White Sox were battling the Red Sox for the pennant. With Ken Berry on third base with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Red Sox leading 4–3, Duane Josephson lined out to Jose Tartabull in right field. Not known for having a strong arm, Tartabull&#x27;s throw sailed high and was caught by a leaping Howard, who blocked the plate with his left foot as he came down, and swipe tagged Berry — ending the game. For Red Sox fans, the play was considered a key event during their &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; season.

Howard had his last postseason highlight in the 1967 World Series against the Cardinals when his bases-loaded single in the ninth inning of Game 5 drove in two runs for a 3–0 lead. The hit was crucial, as former teammate Maris homered in the bottom of the inning for the Cardinals before the Red Sox closed out the 3–1 win. St. Louis, however, won the Series in seven games. It was the sixth losing World Series team Howard played on; he and Pee Wee Reese have the dubious distinction for playing on the most losing World Series teams.

On October 29, 1968, Howard was released by the Red Sox. Over his 14-year career, he batted .274 with 167 home runs, 1,471 hits, 762 RBI, 619 runs, 218 doubles, 50 triples and nine stolen bases in 1,605 games. His .427 slugging average trailed those of only Dickey (.486), Berra (.482) and Mickey Cochrane (.478) among AL catchers. Defensively, he recorded a .993 fielding percentage as a catcher and an overall .992 fielding percentage. Howard also played at left and right field and first base. His 54 total World Series games placed him behind only teammates Berra and Mantle. Howard is also credited with being the first to use the extended index and pinky finger (corna) to indicate that there were two out in the inning, this being more visible to teammates in the outfield than the usual &quot;two&quot; gesture of the index and middle fingers.

==Coaching career==
===New York Yankees (1969–1979)===
Howard returned to the Yankees the following year, where he served as first-base coach from 1969 to 1979. He was the first black coach in the American League. The team won the AL pennant in 1976 and the World Series in 1977 and 1978. During a game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park in June 1977, Howard and Yogi Berra were peacemakers during a dugout incident between Yankees player Reggie Jackson and Yankees manager Billy Martin.

After Howard&#x27;s coaching career ended, he became an administrative assistant with the Yankees; however, that position did not last long due to declining health.

==Death==
Howard was diagnosed with myocarditis, a rare heart disease that causes rapid heart failure. He was considering a heart transplant, but his condition quickly deteriorated. After staying a week at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, Howard died of the heart ailment at age 51 on December 14, 1980. He was interred at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.

Red Smith, a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reacted by writing, &quot;The Yankees&#x27; organization lost more class on the weekend than George Steinbrenner could buy in 10 years.&quot;

==Legacy==
In Howard&#x27;s memory, the Yankees wore black armbands on their sleeve during the 1981 season. On July 21, 1984, the Yankees retired Howard&#x27;s uniform number 32 and dedicated a plaque in his honor for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. On that day the Yankees also bestowed the same honors to Roger Maris who, unlike Howard, was still living. Howard&#x27;s plaque describes him as &quot;A man of great gentleness and dignity&quot; and &quot;one of the truly great Yankees.&quot;

Howard is credited with inventing the batting &quot;doughnut&quot;, a circular lead weight with a rubber shell used by batters in the on-deck circle by placing it around a bat to make it feel heavier, so that it will feel lighter at the plate and easier to swing. Its widespread use caused the discontinuation of the practice of hitters swinging multiple bats at the same time while waiting to hit. Howard helped two New Jersey entrepreneurs, Frank Hamilton and Vince Salvucci, to market the bat weight and lent his name to the product.

In 2020, the baseball field on the former site of Yankee Stadium was renamed in Howard&#x27;s honor. The field sits directly across the street from the new Stadium.

Howard was portrayed by Bobby Hosea in the 2001 film &quot;61*&quot; and in the 2014 Broadway play &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot;.

His great-nephew is NBA player Josh Hart, who has described him as a role model.

<text>North Tipperary () was a county in Ireland in the province of Munster. It was named after the town of Tipperary (which was in South Tipperary) and consisted of 48% of the land area of the traditional county of Tipperary. North Tipperary County Council was the local authority for the county. In 2011, the population of the county was 70,322.

It was abolished on 1 June 2014, amalgamated with South Tipperary to form County Tipperary, administered by a new Tipperary County Council.

==Geography and subdivisions==

The county was part of the central plain of Ireland, but the diversified terrain contained several mountain ranges: the Arra Hills, Silvermine Mountains and the Devil&#x27;s Bit. The county was landlocked. The southern part of the former county is drained by the River Suir; the northern part is drained by tributaries of the River Shannon which widens into Lough Derg. The centre of the county included much of the Golden Vale, a rich pastoral stretch of land in the Suir basin which extends into counties Limerick and Cork.

Its population centres included Nenagh (the county town), Borrisoleigh, Templemore, Thurles, and Roscrea.

===Baronies===
There were six historic baronies in North Tipperary: Eliogarty, Ikerrin, Ormond Upper, Ormond Lower, Owney and Arra and Kilnamanagh Upper.

===Civil parishes and townlands===

Civil parishes in Ireland were delineated after the Down Survey as an intermediate subdivision, with multiple townlands per parish and multiple parishes per barony. The civil parishes had some use in local taxation and were included on the nineteenth century maps of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. For poor law purposes district electoral divisions replaced the civil parishes in the mid-nineteenth century. There were 86 civil parishes in the county.

==Local government==

The North Riding had existed as a judicial county following the establishment of assize courts in 1838. The administrative county of Tipperary, North Riding was created under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 as the area of the existing judicial county of the North Riding of the county of Tipperary, except for the district electoral divisions of Cappagh, Curraheen and Glengar (which were transferred to the South Riding). It took effect on 1 April 1899.

In 2002, the county&#x27;s name was changed under the Local Government Act 2001 to North Tipperary, and the council&#x27;s name to North Tipperary County Council. The council oversaw the county as a local government area. The council comprised 21 representatives, directly elected through the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote (PR-STV).

Under the Regional Authorities established in 1994, North Tipperary was part of the Mid-West Region, a NUTS III region of the European Union, whereas South Tipperary was part of the South-East Region. At a NUTS II level, both counties were in the Southern and Eastern region. A revision to the NUTS regions, after the amalgamation of the counties, brought both under the Mid-West Region.

The council also claimed the title of &quot;The Premier County&quot;, a title which was usually taken to refer to the undivided territory of both north and south Tipperary. Following the division of the original county, North Tipperary was not granted its own coat of arms.

<doc id="524407" wikidata="Q2356240" url="?curid=524407" title="Munio of Zamora">
<text>Munio of Zamora, [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], (1237 – 19 February 1300) was a Spanish Dominican friar who became the seventh Master General of the Dominican Order in 1285, and later a bishop.

==Life==

===Spain===
No details of Munio&#x27;s early life are recorded, but he is assumed to have been born in Zamora. What is known of him comes from diverse sources, of varying value, and giving contradictory judgments. It would appear that he had a reputation of being an excellent administrator, when he was appointed as Prior Provincial of his native country in 1281. He was also known as being an ascetic man, practicing perpetual abstinence, though he also came to be known for his leniency towards those under his authority.

One notable difference he had from his predecessors was that he did not have the academic background which they did, never having studied at the great universities of Italy or France, and thus not having a Master&#x27;s degree. Administration was his sole talent.

===Master General===
Munio, in his office as Prior Provincial, took part in the General Chapter of the Order, held in Bologna in 1285. When he was nominated as Master of the Order at that gathering, the French contingent of the Chapter objected to him based on his alleged lack of studies appropriate to the office. Nevertheless, the Chapter elected him.
The state of the Order as a whole at the time of Munio&#x27;s election required a man of his gifts. The rapid growth of the Order had often been accomplished with minimal training of its new members. Discipline had become a major concern of Munio&#x27;s predecessors, who issued frequent appeals to the friars and nuns of the Order to maintain the spirit of the Rule. Men were joining who claimed to have already the gift of preaching, and demanded to do so without any restrictions on the part of the Order.

In his first letter to the Order at large after his election, Munio issues a serious call to the friars and nuns to keep a spirit of poverty more strenuously, as well as an adherence to solitude and silence. He concludes:

====The Third Order====
Shortly after his election as Master, Munio promulgated the &quot;Rule of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance of the Blessed Dominic&quot; (&quot;Regula Fratrum et Sororum Ordinis de Paenitentiae Beati Dominici&quot;), which provided a rule of life (lasting into the 21st century) for the &quot;penitent&quot; laymen and women who had been leading lives inspired by the friars, long called the Third Order of St. Dominic. In the opening passages, the Rule lays down these prerequisites: &quot;They must be filled with the utmost jealous, burning zeal, after their own fashion, for the truth of Catholic faith&quot;.

The Master of the Order thus offered an opportunity to lay people and secular clergy, who had been independent until then, to adopt a rule of life and to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Dominican Order, by making a promise of obedience to the Master General of the Order. The laity were here being given an ecclesiastical mission and were being placed at the service of the preaching of truth &quot;in accordance with their own life&quot;.

With this formal incorporation into the structure of the Dominican Order, the groups of Dominican penitents began to grow and flourish. With their legitimization through their Rule, they were able to withstand the accusations of the Franciscans, who might have felt some competition with their own Third Order.

This was a major development in the life of the Order, and was taken upon his initiative. Thus Munio played a significant role in the history of the Dominican Order. There were consequences, however. Upon the ascension to the Throne of St. Peter, the Franciscan friar, Pope Nicholas IV, took Munio&#x27;s legislation as a reason to edit the Dominican Rule in its entirety.

===Resignation===
After Nicholas&#x27; election, rumors and stories about Munio&#x27;s past started to circulate in Rome. Among them were the charges that he had been elected thanks, in large part, to the manipulations and bribery of his patron, King Sancho IV of Castile.

It was further alleged that Munio was also in the background when Sancho had authorized a payment of 30,000 &quot;maravedís&quot; to Cardinal Ordoño in 1285, just one month after Munio had been elevated to Master General. This was to cover the fact that Munio, dissolute and violent, made an earlier appearance in an affair involving a monastery of Dominican nuns in the small provincial city of his hometown of Zamora, which had occasioned a canonical visitation by the Bishop of Zamora in 1279. The community of Dominican nuns was split into factions, and the Dominican friars were behaving like characters from the &quot;Decameron.&quot; The resulting depositions survive, to form the basis of a highly readable history by Peter Linehan (1997) that lays open more than just the social history of Dominican friars and nuns in 13th-century Castile. Following Munio, his friends and his enemies, from Zamora to the papal court over a twenty-year period, Linehan shows how events in a Castilian monastery could influence high politics in the medieval Church.

Despite the shaky foundations of the rumors, in 1289 Pope Nicholas chose to believe them, and made a personal appeal to Munio that he resign his office. Munio did not act on this request. Then came the General Chapter of 1290, in which Munio was re-elected, despite the allegations. The capitulars in attendance declared that Munio&#x27;s reputation for abstinence was so well-founded that the only infractions were of such a nature that it would have involved morsels &quot;without which life was not worth living&quot;. Seeing this support, the pope offered Munio the position of Archbishop of Compostella, if he were to resign. Munio&#x27;s response was that he would remove himself from office, if that was the Holy Father&#x27;s will. Pope Nicholas demurred from taking such a responsibility.

The pope&#x27;s indecision did not last long, however, for, the following year (1291), Pope Nicholas, with the support of the Archbishop of Genoa, Jacobus de Voragine (the author of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;), ordered that Munio be removed from his office. Nicholas did so in a papal bull dated April 12, 1291, which he sent to the General Chapter for that year, which was being held in Palencia, Spain. The dismissal was not carried out, as King Sancho attacked the convoy of the papal messengers and seized the bull. Nevertheless, in 1292 the pope dramatically demanded that his command to the Order be implemented.

===Bishopric and death===
Munio&#x27;s career was rehabilitated in 1294, when he was appointed Bishop of Palencia, thanks to the interventions 
of his protector, King Sancho. He had been in Palencia only two years, when, tired and disillusioned, he resigned his office and retired to the international motherhouse of the Order, the Monastery of Santa Sabina in Rome. It was there that he died on 19 February 1300. His body was entombed in the ancient Basilica of Santa Sabina.

<text>Perth-Andover is a former village in Victoria County, New Brunswick, Canada. It held village status prior to 2023. It is now part of the village of Southern Victoria.

==History==
Andover was originally called Little Tobique, the community was given the name Andover, from the town in Hampshire, England. Much of Andover&#x27;s original land grants were to English soldiers and Loyalist from the American Revolution.

Much of Perth (originally called Larlee) was originally part of the territory of the Tobique First Nation, whose reserve was established in 1801, at the band&#x27;s request. Due to squatters, the First Nation were forced to surrender a total of 2,539 acres, much in Perth-Andover.

In 1878 the New Brunswick Railway opened its line through the community connecting Fredericton and Edmundston, crossing the river from the east bank at Perth to the west bank at Andover. In 1890 the NBR was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). In 1894 the Tobique Valley Railway constructed a line from a junction with the CPR at Perth to Plaster Rock; it was leased by CPR in 1897.

Until the end of county government in New Brunswick in 1966, Andover was the shire town of Victoria County.

In March 1987 the spring freshet caused several severe ice jams on the Saint John River upstream of the railway bridge in Perth-Andover. On the night of April 1, 1987 an extremely high water level forced residents to evacuate, including a seniors home and the hospital. The morning of April 2, 1987 the Canadian Pacific Railway bridge was demolished by the large ice jam, and many buildings and homes along the river in Perth-Andover were flooded. The destruction of the railway bridge cut off CP Rail&#x27;s network north of Perth from the railway lines in the southern part of western New Brunswick. This contributed to CP Rail&#x27;s abandonment of these rural branchlines, which were considered unprofitable by the railway. CP Rail tried to blame NB Power for failing to control water discharges from its hydro-electric dams on the river. By the early 1990s, the railroad had ended railway from the northern end of the Saint John River valley.

In 2009 the Canadian government accepted the Tobique Specific Land Claim of 10,533 acres for negotiation; this relates to the 1892 surrender which the First Nation claims is invalid due to the failure of the government to get approval by Order in Council. Settlement of the claim will result in compensation; existing landowners will not be affected. The governments and the Tobique First Nation have three years to negotiate a settlement.

On March 23, 2012, a high spring freshet coupled with an ice jam caused a rise in water levels surpassing those in the 1987 flood. A mandatory evacuation order was issued. About 500 people were affected.

On 1 January 2023, Perth-Andover amalgamated with the village of Aroostook and parts of two local service districts to form the new village of Southern Victoria. The community&#x27;s name remains in official use.

==Geography==
The village is divided by the Saint John River with Perth on the east bank and Andover on the west bank; each was a separate community until municipal amalgamation in 1966. Perth-Andover&#x27;s population meets the requirements for &quot;town&quot; status under the provincial Municipalities Act; however, it has not applied to change from village designation. It was decided by the council at the time to keep the &#x27;Village &#x27; designation.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Perth-Andover had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Attractions ==
Perth-Andover is host to the annual Gathering of the Scots Festival at Veteran&#x27;s Field on the last weekend in May and the Larlee Creek Hullabaloo in August, held at Baird&#x27;s Campground. Other major events in the Village are the Tuff Muck Challenge on the last Saturday in July and the Dam Run marathon on the first Saturday in October. Neat Perth Andover, the Tomlinson Lake Hike to Freedom Trail explores New Brunswick&#x27;s role in the Underground Railroad for African Americans escaping enslavement who crossed the border from the Maple Grove Friends Church near Fort Fairfield, Maine.

== Infrastructure ==
Perth-Andover Electric Light Commission (PAELC) is one of three municipal power utilities left in New Brunswick, and the only one completely independent of NB Power. The residents of the municipality pay the lowest power rates in the province.

<doc id="524409" wikidata="Q1076415" url="?curid=524409" title="South Tipperary">
<text>South Tipperary () was a county in Ireland in the province of Munster. It was named after the town of Tipperary and consisted of 52% of the land area of the traditional county of Tipperary. South Tipperary County Council was the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 88,433 according to the 2011 census. It was abolished on 1 June 2014, and amalgamated with North Tipperary to form County Tipperary under a new Tipperary County Council.

== Geography and subdivisions ==

The county was part of the central plain of Ireland, but the diversified terrain contained several mountain ranges, notably the Knockmealdowns and the Galtees. The county was landlocked and drained by the River Suir. The centre of the county included much of the Golden Vale, a rich pastoral stretch of land in the Suir basin which extends into counties Limerick and Cork.

The county town was Clonmel; other important urban centres included Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Cahir and Tipperary. The county&#x27;s motto was &quot;Vallis Aurea Siurensis&quot; ().

===Baronies===
There were six historic baronies in South Tipperary: Clanwilliam, Iffa and Offa East, Iffa and Offa West, Kilnamanagh Lower, Middle Third and Slievardagh.

===Civil parishes and townlands===

Civil parishes in Ireland were delineated after the Down Survey as an intermediate subdivision, with multiple townlands per parish and multiple parishes per barony. The civil parishes had some use in local taxation and were included on the nineteenth century maps of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. For poor law purposes, district electoral divisions replaced civil parishes in the mid-nineteenth century. There were 123 civil parishes in the county.

==Local government==
The South Riding of Tipperary had been a judicial county following the establishment of assize courts in 1838. 

The administrative county of Tipperary, South Riding was created under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 as the area of the existing judicial county of the South Riding of the county of Tipperary, with the addition of the district electoral divisions previously in the North Riding of Cappagh, Curraheen and Glengar, and the portions of the town of Carrick-on-Suir and the borough of Clonmel previously in County Waterford. It took effect on 1 April 1899.

In 2002, under the Local Government Act 2001, the county&#x27;s name was changed to South Tipperary, and the council&#x27;s name to South Tipperary County Council. The council oversaw the county as a local government area. The council was composed of 26 representatives, directly elected through the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote (PR-STV).
South Tipperary was part of the South-East Region, a NUTS III region of the European Union, whereas North Tipperary was part of the Mid-West Region. At a NUTS II level, both counties were in the Southern and Eastern region. A revision to the NUTS regions, after the amalgamation of the counties, brought both under the Mid-West Region.

==Irish language==
There were native speakers of Irish in South Tipperary until the middle of the 20th century. Recordings of their dialect, made before the last native speakers died, have been made available through a project of the Royal Irish Academy Library.

<text>CARNET (Croatian Academic and Research Network, ) is the national research and education network of Croatia. It is funded from the government budget and it operates from offices in Zagreb and five other cities.

CARNET was established in 1991 as a project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Croatia. In March 1995 the Government of the Republic of Croatia passed the Decree on founding of the CARNET institution with the purpose of facilitating progress of individuals, as well as of the society as a whole, through the use of new information technologies.

CARNET&#x27;s activities can be divided in three basic areas: Internet service provision, encouragement of information society development and education for the new era.

==History==

===The institution===
A body responsible for coordinating the establishment of the Croatian educational computer network has been established on 3 October 1991. That was the beginning of the work of the Croatian Academic and Research Network - CARNET, the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Croatia. In the several years that followed CARNET was the only Internet service provider in Croatia, providing the service free of charge, not only to the academic community, but to all citizens of the Republic of Croatia as well.

In November 1992 the first international communication connection was established, which connected CARNET Internet exchange point in Zagreb to Austria. By that act Croatia became a part of the world computer network – the Internet.

During 1992, the first equipment was procured and the backbone of the CARNET network was built. Institutions in Croatia were connected at the speed of 19 - 200 kbit/s, while the whole network was connected to the Internet through Austria at the speed of 64 kbit/s.
The first institutions to be connected to the Internet were the University Computing Centre - SRCE, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, the Ruđer Bošković Institute, the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture in Split, the Faculty of Engineering in Rijeka, the Faculty of Economics in Osijek and the Ministry of Science and Technology.

During the first months of 1993, CARNET was assigned the administration over the top-level .hr domain by the international organisation called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
In October 1994, CARNET started offering the first Internet courses to its users and, in time, user education became one of CARNET’s most important activities.

===Network===
In 1996, the backbone of CARNET network was upgraded by introducing the ATM technology which enables real-time transfer of image and sound at the basic speed of 155 Mbit/s.

In January 1997, the first distance lecture in Croatia was organized through the CARNET ATM core between the Rectorate of the Osijek University and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb.
GÉANT, the pan-European academic and research network, was put into service on 1 December 2001, and CARNET, among others, connected to it.

In cooperation with the University Computing Centre - SRCE, in 2003 CARNET released the Giga CARNET project in order to use gigabit technologies to develop a high quality infrastructure for CARNET member institutions, faculties and research institutes. In the framework of the Giga CARNET project, in February 2004 CARNET was enabled, through the connection to the GÉANT network, to have a twice-faster connection to similar academic and research networks in Europe and all over the world (at the speed of 1.2 Gbit/s instead of the former 622 Mbit/s).

As a necessary requirement for further cooperation between CARNET and the world&#x27;s academic and research communities, in June 2007 the speed of CARNET&#x27;s connection towards the GÉANT network was increased to 10 Gbit/s.

Chronology 

===2020 Cyberattack===

On 16 March, Minister of Education Blaženka Divjak confirmed that the same day CARNET, responsible for online classes in Croatia, was a victim of a cyberattack making the online classes impossible at that moment.

==Organisation==

CARNET operates through services and projects integrated in eight departments:
* Network Infrastructure Department
* Computer and IT Systems and Services Department
* Computer Security Department
* National CERT Department
* User Support Department
* Education Support Department
* General and Financial Activities Department
* Office of the CEO

The CEO coordinates the activities at the level of the entire institution and outside it, acts on behalf of the institution and represents CARNET in public. CARNET Executive Committee consists of the CEO, the vice CEO and deputy CEOs (heads of the said departments). The Committee coordinates short- and long-term planning, makes decisions on business organisation and is responsible for the relations with the government bodies, users, partners and the public.

CARNET is run by the Managing Council which represents the interests of CARNET founders, the Government of the Republic of Croatia. Managing Council members are appointed by the Minister of Science, Education and Sports.

The Users Board is CARNET&#x27;s advisory body consisting of all CARNET coordinators at CARNET member institutions as the representatives of the academic community, heads of county-level computer science councils as the representatives of school system users, and the CARNET CEO.

==Infrastructure==
Basic activities of the Croatian Academic and Research Network - CARNET are network development, building and maintenance. CARNET network is a private network of the Croatian academic, scientific and research community and the primary and secondary school system institutions.

Network infrastructure is owned by the CARNET institution, but cables are rented from a number of telecommunication providers. CARNET network is an example of a WAN network which enables CARNET members throughout Croatia to be connected into a compact information and communication system.

CARNET network is a data network whose principal purpose is to transfer data through the TCP/IP protocol. The currently supported version of the TCP/IP protocol in the CARNET network as its integral part is version 4 (IPv4). The key characteristic of every private network is its connection to the global network - the Internet. The CARNET network established this connection through the GÉANT pan-European research network, with the current connection speed of 10 Gbit/s. The connection to other Internet service providers in Croatia has been implemented through the Croatian Internet Exchange Point – CIX.

In Croatia, the CARNET network connects the major Croatian towns and cities on the mainland and a number of settlements on the islands. The larger university centres (Dubrovnik, Osijek, Pula, Rijeka, Split, Zadar, Zagreb) have high speed connections (ranging from 155 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s), while smaller centres are connected at the speeds ranging from 2 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. Zagreb has a particularly advanced infrastructure, connecting larger faculties and scientific institutions at the speeds of up to 10 Gbit/s. Thanks to the project &quot;e-Split&quot;, which CARNET has accomplished in cooperation with the City of Split, Split is the first city in which CARNET has its own optical network. Through that optical network 158 CARNET member institutions, in the city area, are connected to CARNET network.

More than 900 institutions from the primary and secondary school systems are also connected to the CARNET network via ADSL connections, and schools on Croatian islands have been connected to CARNET network in the framework of the e-Islands project.

==International cooperation==
As part of its vision of inclusion of the Republic of Croatia in modern information society, CARNET participates in a series of international activities.

Parallel with the increase of physical link speed on GEANT network, there is an increased development of CARNET&#x27;s parallel (human) link towards European and international academic Internet community. CARNET activities in the sphere of international cooperation are forming a stable communication channel towards foreign countries, providing CARNET with an opportunity to present Croatia and its academic research community.

International cooperation includes following the activities of other academic networks in Europe and participating in the work of international organisations that gather national, educational, academic and research networks. CARNET also promotes the inclusion of the Croatian academic community into international projects in the field of information technologies research and application and coordinates the participation of CARNET employees in international projects.

CARNET is active member of several international organisations:

* Trans - European Research and Education Networking Association
* The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
* Réseaux IP Européens
* Council of European National Top-Level Domain Registries
* Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)
* NREN Consortium

==Users==
CARNET users are member institutions and individual users.

CARNET member institutions are institutions belonging to the science and higher education system, as well as those belonging to the primary and secondary school systems. By obtaining the member status, institutions are connected to the CARNET network and entitled to use the CARNET services. CARNET has 241 member institutions from the academic community connected to the CARNET network at 418 locations. There are 1385 members from the primary and secondary school systems, connected at 1283 locations.

Individual users are higher education students and professors, scientists and persons employed in the academic and higher education community, primary and secondary school students, teachers and employees at primary and secondary schools and student homes.

At their respective central institution individual users obtain electronic identities in the AAI@EduHr system. Electronic identity is a virtual identity on the CARNET network which serves for user authentication and authorisation for different CARNET services and is necessary for the use of CARNET services.

<text>Computer science and engineering (CSE) or computer science (CS) also integrated as electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) in some universities, is an academic subject comprising approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are historically more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms), and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture). CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of technical or engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.

== Academic courses ==
Academic programs vary between colleges, but typically include a combination of topics in computer science,computer engineering, and electrical engineering. Undergraduate courses usually include programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, machine learning, programming theory and paradigms. Modern academic programs also cover emerging computing fields like image processing, data science, robotics, bio-inspired computing, computational biology, autonomic computing and artificial intelligence. Most CSE programs require introductory mathematical knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses, primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability, and statistics, as well as the introduction to physics and electrical and electronic engineering. Students usually also have the opportunity to choose one social science subject.

<doc id="524434" wikidata="Q1041962" url="?curid=524434" title="Philae (spacecraft)">
<text>Philae ( or ) was a robotic European Space Agency lander that accompanied the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft until it separated to land on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, ten years and eight months after departing Earth. On 12 November 2014, &quot;Philae&quot; touched down on the comet, but it bounced when its anchoring harpoons failed to deploy and a thruster designed to hold the probe to the surface did not fire. After bouncing off the surface twice, &quot;Philae&quot; achieved the first-ever &quot;soft&quot; (nondestructive) landing on a comet nucleus, although the lander&#x27;s final, uncontrolled touchdown left it in a non-optimal location and orientation.

Despite the landing problems, the probe&#x27;s instruments obtained the first images from a comet&#x27;s surface. Several of the instruments on &quot;Philae&quot; made the first in-situ analysis of a comet nucleus, sending back data regarding the composition of the surface and outgassing from the subsurface. In October 2020, scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published an article revealing what &quot;Philae&quot; had discovered while it was operational on the surface of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

On 15 November 2014 &quot;Philae&quot; entered safe mode, or hibernation, after its batteries ran down due to reduced sunlight and an off-nominal spacecraft orientation at the crash site. Mission controllers hoped that additional sunlight on the solar panels might be sufficient to reboot the lander. &quot;Philae&quot; communicated sporadically with &quot;Rosetta&quot; from 13 June to 9 July 2015, but contact was then lost. The lander&#x27;s location was known to within a few tens of metres but it could not be seen. Its location was finally identified in photographs taken by &quot;Rosetta&quot; on 2 September 2016 as the orbiter was sent on orbits closer to the comet. The now-silent &quot;Philae&quot; was lying on its side in a deep crack in the shadow of a cliff. Knowledge of its location would help in interpretation of the images it had sent. On 30 September 2016, the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft ended its mission by crashing in the comet&#x27;s Ma&#x27;at region.

The lander is named after the Philae obelisk, which bears a bilingual inscription and was used along with the Rosetta Stone to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs. &quot;Philae&quot; was monitored and operated from DLR&#x27;s Lander Control Center in Cologne, Germany, supported by the CNES&#x27; SONC in Toulouse, France.

== Mission ==

&quot;Philae&quot; mission was to land successfully on the surface of a comet, attach itself, and transmit data about the comet&#x27;s composition. The &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft and &quot;Philae&quot; lander were launched on an Ariane 5G+ rocket from French Guiana on 2 March 2004, 07:17 UTC, and travelled for 3,907 days (10.7 years) to Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Unlike the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe, which by design struck comet Tempel 1&#x27;s nucleus on 4 July 2005, &quot;Philae&quot; is not an impactor. Some of the instruments on the lander were used for the first time as autonomous systems during the Mars flyby on 25 February 2007. CIVA, one of the camera systems, returned some images while the &quot;Rosetta&quot; instruments were powered down, while ROMAP took measurements of the Martian magnetosphere. Most of the other instruments needed contact with the surface for analysis and stayed offline during the flyby. An optimistic estimate of mission length following touchdown was &quot;four to five months&quot;.

=== Scientific goals ===
The goals of the scientific mission have been summarised as follows: &quot;The scientific goals of its experiments focus on elemental, isotopic, molecular and mineralogical composition of the cometary material, the characterization of physical properties of the surface and subsurface material, the large-scale structure and the magnetic and plasma environment of the nucleus. In particular, surface and sub-surface samples will be acquired and sequentially analyzed by a suite of instruments. Measurements will be performed primarily during descent and along the first five days following touch-down. &quot;

== Landing and surface operations ==

&quot;Philae&quot; remained attached to the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft after rendezvousing with Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 6 August 2014. On 15 September 2014, ESA announced &quot;&quot; on the smaller lobe of the comet as the lander&#x27;s destination. Following an ESA public contest in October 2014, was renamed &quot;Agilkia&quot; in honour of Agilkia Island.

A series of four go/no-go checks were performed on 11–12 November 2014. One of the final tests before detachment from &quot;Rosetta&quot; showed that the lander&#x27;s cold-gas thruster was not working correctly, but the &quot;go&quot; was given anyway, as it could not be repaired. &quot;Philae&quot; detached from &quot;Rosetta&quot; on 12 November 2014 at 08:35 UTC SCET.

=== Landing events ===
&quot;Philae&quot; landing signal was received by Earth communication stations at 16:03 UTC after a 28-minute delay. Unknown to mission scientists at that time, the lander had bounced. It began performing scientific measurements while slowly moving away from the comet and coming back down, confusing the science team. Further analysis showed that it bounced twice.

&quot;Philae&quot; first contact with the comet occurred at 15:34:04 UTC SCET. The probe rebounded off the comet&#x27;s surface at and rose to an altitude of approximately . For perspective, had the lander exceeded about , it would have escaped the comet&#x27;s gravity. After detecting the touchdown, &quot;Philae&quot; reaction wheel was automatically powered off, resulting in its momentum being transferred back into the lander. This caused the vehicle to begin rotating every 13 seconds. During this first bounce, at 16:20 UTC SCET, the lander is thought to have struck a surface prominence, which slowed its rotation to once every 24 seconds and sent the craft tumbling. &quot;Philae&quot; touched down a second time at 17:25:26 UTC SCET and rebounded at . The lander came to a final stop on the surface at 17:31:17 UTC SCET. It sits in rough terrain, apparently in the shadow of a nearby cliff or crater wall, and is canted at an angle of around 30 degrees, but is otherwise undamaged. Its final location was determined initially by analysis of data from CONSERT in combination with the comet shape model based on images from the &quot;Rosetta&quot; orbiter, and later precisely by direct imaging from &quot;Rosetta&quot;.

An analysis of telemetry indicated that the initial impact was softer than expected, that the harpoons had not deployed, and that the thruster had not fired. The harpoon propulsion system contained 0.3 grams of nitrocellulose, which was shown by Copenhagen Suborbitals in 2013 to be unreliable in a vacuum.

=== Operations and communication loss ===
The primary battery was designed to power the instruments for about 60 hours. ESA expected that a secondary rechargeable battery would be partially filled by the solar panels attached to the outside of the lander, but the limited sunlight (90 minutes per 12.4-hour comet day) at the actual landing site was inadequate to maintain &quot;Philae&quot; activities, at least in this phase of the comet&#x27;s orbit.

On the morning of 14 November 2014, the battery charge was estimated to be only enough for continuing operations for the remainder of the day. After first obtaining data from instruments whose operation did not require mechanical movement, comprising about 80% of the planned initial science observations, both the MUPUS soil penetrator and the SD2 drill were commanded to deploy. Subsequently, MUPUS data as well as COSAC and Ptolemy data were returned. A final set of CONSERT data was also downlinked towards the end of operations. During the evening&#x27;s transmission session, &quot;Philae&quot; was raised by and its body rotated 35 degrees to more favourably position the largest solar panel to capture the most sunlight in the future. Shortly afterwards, electrical power dwindled rapidly and all instruments were forced to shut down. The downlink rate slowed to a trickle before coming to a stop. Contact was lost on 15 November at 00:36 UTC.

The German Aerospace Center&#x27;s lander manager Stephan Ulamec stated:
=== Instrument results ===
Data from the SESAME instrument determined that, rather than being &quot;soft and fluffy&quot; as expected, &quot;Philae&quot; first touchdown site held a large amount of water ice under a layer of granular material about deep. It found that the mechanical strength of the ice was high and that cometary activity in that region was low. At the final landing site, the MUPUS instrument was unable to hammer very far into the comet&#x27;s surface, despite power being gradually increased. This area was determined to have the consistency of solid ice or pumice.

In the atmosphere of the comet, the COSAC instrument detected the presence of molecules containing carbon and hydrogen. Soil elements could not be assessed, because the lander was unable to drill into the comet surface, likely due to hard ice. The SD2 drill went through the necessary steps to deliver a surface sample to the COSAC instrument, but nothing entered the COSAC ovens.

Upon &quot;Philae&quot; first touchdown on the comet&#x27;s surface, COSAC measured material at the bottom of the vehicle, which was disturbed by the landing, while the Ptolemy instrument measured material at the top of the vehicle. Sixteen organic compounds were detected, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde.

=== Reawakening and subsequent loss of communication ===

On 13 June 2015 at 20:28 UTC, ground controllers received an 85-second transmission from &quot;Philae&quot;, forwarded by &quot;Rosetta&quot;, indicating that the lander was in good health and had sufficiently recharged its batteries to come out of safe mode. &quot;Philae&quot; sent historical data indicating that although it had been operating earlier than 13 June 2015, it had been unable to contact &quot;Rosetta&quot; before that date. The lander reported that it was operating with 24 watts of electrical power at .

A new contact between &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot; was confirmed on 19 June 2015. The first signal was received on the ground from &quot;Rosetta&quot; at 13:37 UTC, while a second signal was received at 13:54 UTC. These contacts lasted about two minutes each and delivered additional status data. By 26 June 2015, there had been a total of seven intermittent contacts between the lander and orbiter. There were two opportunities for contact between the two spacecraft each Earth day, but their duration and quality depended on the orientation of the transmitting antenna on &quot;Philae&quot; and the location of &quot;Rosetta&quot; along its trajectory around the comet. Similarly, as the comet rotated, &quot;Philae&quot; was not always in sunlight and thus not always generating enough power via its solar panels to receive and transmit signals. ESA controllers continued to try to establish a stable contact duration of at least 50 minutes.

Had &quot;Philae&quot; landed at the planned site of Agilkia in November 2014, its mission would probably have ended in March 2015 due to the higher temperatures of that location as solar heating increased. , &quot;Philae&quot; key remaining experiment was to drill into the comet&#x27;s surface to determine its chemical composition. Ground controllers sent commands to power up the CONSERT radar instrument on 5 July 2015, but received no immediate response from the lander. Confirmation was eventually received on 9 July, when the lander transmitted measurement data from the instrument.

Immediately after its reawakening, housekeeping data suggested that the lander&#x27;s systems were healthy, and mission control uploaded commands for &quot;Rosetta&quot; to establish a new orbit and nadir so as to optimize communications, diagnostics, and enable new science investigations with &quot;Philae&quot;. However, controllers had difficulties establishing a stable communications connection with the lander. The situation was not helped by the need to keep &quot;Rosetta&quot; at a greater and safer distance from the comet as it became more active. The last communication was on 9 July 2015, and mission controllers were unable to instruct &quot;Philae&quot; to carry out new investigations. Subsequently, &quot;Philae&quot; failed to respond to further commands, and by January 2016, controllers acknowledged no further communications were likely.

On 27 July 2016, at 09:00 UTC, ESA switched off the Electrical Support System Processor Unit (ESS) onboard &quot;Rosetta&quot;, making further communications with &quot;Philae&quot; impossible.

===Location===
The lander was located on 2 September 2016 by the narrow-angle camera aboard &quot;Rosetta&quot; as it was slowly making its descent to the comet. The search for the lander had been on-going during the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, using telemetry data and comparison of pictures taken before and after the lander&#x27;s touchdown, looking for signs of the lander&#x27;s specific reflectivity.

The search area was narrowed down to the most promising candidate, which was confirmed by a picture taken at a distance of , clearly showing the lander. The lander sits on its side wedged into a dark crevice of the comet, explaining the lack of electrical power and proper communication with the probe. Knowing its exact location provides information needed to put &quot;Philae&quot; two days of science into proper context.

== Design ==

The lander was designed to deploy from the main spacecraft body and descend from an orbit of along a ballistic trajectory. It would touch down on the comet&#x27;s surface at a velocity of around . The legs were designed to dampen the initial impact to avoid bouncing as the comet&#x27;s escape velocity is only around , and the impact energy was intended to drive ice screws into the surface. &quot;Philae&quot; was to then fire a harpoon into the surface at to anchor itself. A thruster on top of &quot;Philae&quot; was to have fired to lessen the bounce upon impact and to reduce the recoil from harpoon firing. During the landing, the harpoons did not fire and the thruster failed to operate, leading to a multiple-contact landing.

Communications with Earth used the &quot;Rosetta&quot; orbiter as a relay station to reduce the electrical power needed. The mission duration on the surface was planned to be at least one week, but an extended mission lasting months was considered possible.

The main structure of the lander is made from carbon fiber, shaped into a plate maintaining mechanical stability, a platform for the science instruments, and a hexagonal &quot;sandwich&quot; to connect all the parts. The total mass is about . Its exterior is covered with solar cells for power generation.

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission was originally planned to rendezvous with the comet 46P/Wirtanen. A failure in a previous Ariane 5 launch vehicle closed the launch window to reach the comet with the same rocket. It resulted in a change in target to the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The larger mass of Churyumov–Gerasimenko and the resulting increased impact velocity required that the landing gear of the lander be strengthened.

=== Power management ===
&quot;Philae&quot; power management was planned for two phases. In the first phase, the lander operated solely on battery power. In the second phase, it was to run on backup batteries recharged by solar cells.

The power subsystem comprises two batteries: a non-rechargeable primary 1000 watt-hour battery to provide power for the first 60 hours and a secondary 140 watt-hour battery recharged by the solar panels to be used after the primary is exhausted. The solar panels cover and were designed to deliver up to 32 watts at a distance of 3 AU from the Sun.

=== Instruments ===
The science payload of the lander consists of ten instruments totalling , making up just over one quarter of the mass of the lander.

; APXS
:The &quot;Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer&quot; detects alpha particles and X-rays, which provide information on the elemental composition of the comet&#x27;s surface. The instrument is an improved version of the APXS on the Mars Pathfinder.

; CIVA
:The &quot;Comet Nucleus Infrared and Visible Analyser&quot; (sometimes given as ÇIVA) is a group of seven identical cameras used to take panoramic pictures of the surface plus a visible-light microscope and an infrared spectrometer. The panoramic cameras (CIVA-P) are arranged on the sides of the lander at 60° intervals: five mono imagers and two others making up a stereo imager. Each camera has a 1024×1024 pixel CCD detector. The microscope and spectrometer (CIVA-M) are mounted on the base of the lander, and are used to analyse the composition, texture and albedo (reflectivity) of samples collected from the surface.

; CONSERT
:The &quot;Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission&quot; used electromagnetic wave propagation to determine the comet&#x27;s internal structure. A radar on &quot;Rosetta&quot; transmitted a signal through the nucleus to be received by a detector on &quot;Philae&quot;.

; COSAC
:The &quot;Cometary Sampling and Composition&quot; instrument is a combined gas chromatograph and time-of-flight mass spectrometer to perform analysis of soil samples and determine the content of volatile components.

; MUPUS
:The &quot;Multi-Purpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science&quot; instrument measured the density, thermal and mechanical properties of the comet&#x27;s surface.

; Ptolemy
:An instrument measuring stable isotope ratios of key volatiles on the comet&#x27;s nucleus. Parts of the instrument were manufactured by the Special Techniques Group at UKAEA.

; ROLIS
:The &quot;Rosetta Lander Imaging System&quot; is a CCD camera used to obtain high-resolution images during descent and stereo panoramic images of areas sampled by other instruments. The CCD detector consists of 1024×1024 pixels.

; ROMAP
:The &quot;Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor&quot; is a magnetometer and plasma sensor to study the nucleus&#x27; magnetic field and its interactions with the solar wind.

; SD2
:The &quot;Sampling, Drilling and Distribution&quot; system obtains soil samples from the comet and transfers them to the Ptolemy, COSAC, and CIVA instruments for in-situ analysis. SD2 contains four primary subsystems: drill, ovens, carousel, and volume checker. The drill system, made of steel and titanium, is capable of drilling to a depth of , deploying a probe to collect samples, and delivering samples to the ovens. There are a total of 26 platinum ovens to heat samples—10 medium temperature ovens at and 16 high temperature ovens at —and one oven to clear the drill bit for reuse. The ovens are mounted on a rotating carousel that delivers the active oven to the appropriate instrument. The electromechanical volume checker determines how much material was deposited into an oven, and may be used to evenly distribute material on CIVA&#x27;s optical windows. Development of SD2 was led by the Italian Space Agency with contributions by prime contractor Tecnospazio S.p.A. (now Selex ES S.p.A.) in charge of the system design and overall integration; the Italian company Tecnomare S.p.A., owned by Eni S.p.A., in charge of the design, development, and testing of the drilling/sampling tool and the volume checker; Media Lario; and Dallara. The instrument&#x27;s principal investigator is Amalia Ercoli-Finzi (Politecnico di Milano).

; SESAME
:The &quot;Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiments&quot; used three instruments to measure properties of the comet&#x27;s outer layers. The &quot;Cometary Acoustic Sounding Surface Experiment&quot; (CASSE) measures the way in which sound travels through the surface. The &quot;Permittivity Probe&quot; (PP) investigates its electrical characteristics, and the &quot;Dust Impact Monitor&quot; (DIM) measures dust falling back to the surface.

==Analysis of comet==
On 28 October 2020, it was reported that Philae had discovered, among other things, &quot;low-strength primitive ice inside cometary boulders.&quot; This also included primitive water ice from the comet&#x27;s estimated formation 4.5 billion years prior. This occurred primarily at the site of Philae&#x27;s second touchdown onto the 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, where the spacecraft successfully produced four distinct surface contacts on two adjoining cometary boulders. Philae was also able to drill into the comet&#x27;s boulder ice.

== International contributions ==
;Austria
:The Austrian Space Research Institute developed the lander&#x27;s anchor and two sensors within MUPUS, which are integrated into the anchor tips.

:The Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology developed CIVA.

;United Kingdom
:The Open University and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) developed PTOLEMY. RAL also constructed the blankets that kept the lander warm throughout its mission. Surrey Satellites Technology Ltd. (SSTL) constructed the momentum wheel for the lander. It stabilised the module during the descent and landing phases. Manufacturer e2v supplied the CIVA and Rolis camera systems used to film the descent and take images of samples, as well as three other camera systems.
== Media coverage ==
The landing was featured heavily in social media, with the lander having an official Twitter account portraying a personification of the spacecraft. The hashtag &quot;#CometLanding&quot; gained widespread traction. A Livestream of the control centres was set up, as were multiple official and unofficial events around the world to follow &quot;Philae&quot; landing on Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Various instruments on &quot;Philae&quot; were given their own Twitter accounts to announce news and science results.

=== Popular culture ===
Vangelis composed the music for the trio of music videos released by ESA to celebrate the first-ever attempted soft landing on a comet by ESA&#x27;s Rosetta mission.

On 12 November 2014, the search engine Google featured a Google Doodle of &quot;Philae&quot; on its home page. On 31 December 2014, Google featured &quot;Philae&quot; again as part of its New Year&#x27;s Eve 2014 Doodle.

Online comic author Randall Munroe wrote a live updating strip on his website &quot;xkcd&quot; on the day of the landing.

<doc id="524440" wikidata="Q1542533" url="?curid=524440" title="Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone">
<text>The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is the first large canyon on the Yellowstone River downstream from Yellowstone Falls in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The canyon is approximately long, between deep and from wide.

==History==

Although trappers and prospectors who visited the Yellowstone region had knowledge of the canyon, the first significant descriptions were publicized after the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition of 1869 and the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition of 1870.

When Charles W. Cook first viewed the canyon after traveling west from the Lamar Valley on September 20, 1869, he subsequently wrote these words in his journal:

I was riding ahead, the two pack animals following, and then Mr. Folsom and Mr. Peterson on their saddle horses. I remembered seeing what appeared to be an opening in the forest ahead, which I presumed to be a park, or open country. While my attention was attracted by the pack animals, which had stopped to eat grass, my saddle horse suddenly stopped. I turned and looked forward from the brink of the great canyon, at a point just across from what is now called &quot;Inspiration Point&quot;. I sat there in amazement, while my companions came up, and after that, it seemed to me that it was five minutes before anyone spoke.

A year later during the Washburn expedition, on August 30–31, 1870, Lt. Gustavus C. Doane described the canyon with a bit more scientific detail:

In 1890, Bozeman resident H.F. Richardson (known as &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;) was given a permit to operate a ferry across the Yellowstone River near the site of today&#x27;s Chittenden Memorial Bridge and take tourists down into the canyon below the lower falls on &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Trail.&quot; Although the original trail no longer exists, there is still a steep stairway down to the base of the lower falls that is called &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Trail.&quot; &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Trail&quot; is approximately a 3-mile hike.
==Geology==

The specifics of the geology of the canyon are not well understood, except that it is the result of erosion by the Yellowstone River, not by glaciation. After the Yellowstone Caldera eruption of about 600,000 years ago, the area was covered by a series of lava flows. The area was also faulted by the doming action of the caldera before the eruption. The site of the present canyon, as well as any previous canyons, was probably the result of this uplift and related faulting, which allowed erosion to proceed at an accelerated rate. The area was also covered by the glaciers that formed during several ice ages. Glacial deposits probably filled the canyon at one time, but have since been eroded away, leaving little or no evidence of their presence.

The canyon below the Lower Yellowstone Falls was at one time the site of a geyser basin that was the result of rhyolite lava flows, extensive faulting, and heat beneath the surface (related to the hot spot). No one is sure exactly when the geyser basin was formed in the area, although it was probably present at the time of the last glaciation. The chemical and heat action of the geyser basin caused the rhyolite rock to become hydrothermally altered, making it very soft and brittle and more easily erodible (sometimes likened to baking a potato). Evidence of this thermal activity still exists in the canyon in the form of geysers and hot springs that are still active and visible. The Clear Lake area, which is fed by hot springs, south of the canyon is probably also a remnant of this activity.
According to Ken Pierce, U.S. Geological Survey geologist, at the end of the last glacial period, about 14,000 to 18,000 years ago, ice dams formed at the mouth of Yellowstone Lake. When the ice dams melted, a great volume of water was released downstream causing massive flash floods and immediate and catastrophic erosion of the present-day canyon. These flash floods probably happened more than once. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than glaciation. Today the canyon is still being eroded by the Yellowstone River.

The colors in the canyon are also a result of hydrothermal alteration. The rhyolite in the canyon contains a variety of different iron compounds. When the old geyser basin was active, the &quot;cooking&quot; of the rock caused chemical alterations in these iron compounds. Exposure to the elements caused the rocks to change colors. The rocks are oxidizing; in effect, the canyon is rusting. The colors indicate the presence or absence of water in the individual iron compounds. Most of the yellows in the canyon are the result of iron present in the rock.

<text>Billy Bailey (January 1947 – January 25, 1996) was a convicted murderer who was hanged in Delaware in 1996. He became the third person to be hanged in the United States since 1965 (the previous two were Charles Rodman Campbell and Westley Allan Dodd, both in Washington), and the first person hanged in Delaware in 50 years. As of 2025, he remains the last person to be lawfully executed by hanging in the United States.

== Early life ==
The ninth of 23 children, Bailey lived in stark poverty and suffered chronic physical abuse, state records show. His mother died when he was less than a year old. As an adult, Bailey was known to police as a brawler and a thief.

==The crime==
In 1979, after being convicted of forgery, Bailey was assigned to the Plummer House, a work release facility in Wilmington, Delaware, but soon escaped. He later appeared at the home of his foster sister, Sue Ann Coker, in Cheswold, Delaware, saying he was upset and was not going back to the Plummer House.

He and Charles Coker, his foster sister&#x27;s husband, went on an errand in Coker&#x27;s truck. Bailey asked Coker to stop at a liquor store. Bailey entered the store and robbed the clerk at gunpoint. Emerging from the store with a pistol in one hand and a bottle in the other, Bailey told Coker that the police would be arriving, and asked to be dropped at Lambertson&#x27;s Corner, about away.

At Lambertson&#x27;s Corner, Bailey entered the farmhouse of Gilbert Lambertson, aged 80, and his wife, Clara Lambertson, aged 73. Bailey shot Gilbert Lambertson twice in the chest with a pistol, and once in the head with the Lambertsons&#x27; shotgun. He also shot Clara Lambertson once in the shoulder with the pistol, and once each in the abdomen and neck with the shotgun. Both Lambertsons died. Bailey arranged their bodies in chairs, and then fled from the scene. He was spotted by a Delaware State Police helicopter as he ran across the Lambertsons&#x27; field. He attempted to shoot the helicopter co-pilot with the pistol, and was later arrested.

==Conviction==
Bailey was found guilty of the murders in 1980. After his conviction, the jury found that his crimes &quot;were outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman&quot;, and recommended a death sentence. Bailey was sentenced to be hanged by his neck until dead.

== Preparations ==

Although the method of execution in Delaware had been changed to lethal injection in 1986, he had the legal option of choosing to be hanged instead. Bailey refused to accept lethal injection, telling a visitor, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to let them put me to sleep.&quot;

As Delaware had not carried out a hanging in 50 years, state officials sought advice from corrections officials at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington, where hangings had recently been performed.

The wooden gallows were built on the grounds of the Delaware Correctional Center at Smyrna in 1986. The structure required renovation and strengthening before Bailey could be executed on it. The platform housing the trap door was from the ground and accessed by 23 steps.

Delaware used an execution protocol written by Fred Leuchter. Leuchter&#x27;s protocol specified the use of of diameter Manila hemp rope, boiled to take out stretch and any tendency to coil. The length of the rope sliding inside the knot was lubricated with melted paraffin wax, to allow it to slide freely. A black hood was specified by the protocol, as was a sandbag to test the trap door and a &quot;collapse board&quot; to which a prisoner could be strapped if necessary.

The day before, Bailey was weighed at , and the drop was determined to be around .

Bailey was moved from his prison cell to the execution trailer used for lethal injection prior to the execution. There, he spent his last 24 hours, sleeping, eating, watching television, talking with staff, and meeting with his fifty-three-year-old sister, Betty Odom, the prison chaplain, and his attorney. For his last meal, he requested a well-done steak, a baked potato with sour cream and butter, buttered rolls, peas, and vanilla ice cream.

His final appeals having failed, Bailey was executed on January 25, 1996. The gallows in Delaware were dismantled in 2003, because from that year, none of its death row inmates remained eligible to choose hanging over lethal injection.

<doc id="524445" wikidata="Q424519" url="?curid=524445" title="Thrombopoietin">
<text>Thrombopoietin (THPO) also known as megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;THPO&quot; gene.

Thrombopoietin is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the liver and kidney which regulates the production of platelets. It stimulates the production and differentiation of megakaryocytes, the bone marrow cells that bud off large numbers of platelets.

Megakaryocytopoiesis is the cellular development process that leads to platelet production. The protein encoded by this gene is a humoral growth factor necessary for megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation, as well as for thrombopoiesis. This protein is the ligand for MLP/C_MPL, the product of myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene.

== Genetics ==
The thrombopoietin gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (q26.3-27). Abnormalities in this gene occur in some hereditary forms of thrombocytosis (high platelet count) and in some cases of leukemia. The first 155 amino acids of the protein share homology with erythropoietin.

== Function and regulation ==
Thrombopoietin is produced in the liver by both parenchymal cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, as well as in the kidney by proximal convoluted tubule cells. Small amounts are also made by striated muscle and bone marrow stromal cells. In the liver, its production is augmented by interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, the liver and the kidney are the primary sites of thrombopoietin production.

Thrombopoietin regulates the differentiation of megakaryocytes and platelets, but studies on the removal of the thrombopoietin receptor show that its effects on hematopoiesis are more versatile.

Its negative feedback is different from that of most hormones in endocrinology: The effector regulates the hormone directly. Thrombopoietin is bound to the surface of platelets and megakaryocytes by the mpl receptor (CD 110). Inside the platelets it gets destroyed, while inside the megakaryocytes it gives the signal of their maturation and consecutively more platelet production. The bounding of the hormone at these cells thereby reduces further megakaryocyte exposure to the hormone. Therefore, the rising and dropping platelet and megakaryocyte concentrations regulate the thrombopoietin levels. Low platelets and megakaryocytes lead a higher degree of thrombopoietin exposure to the undifferentiated bone marrow cells, leading to differentiation into megakaryocytes and further maturation of these cells. On the other hand, high platelet and megakaryocyte concentrations lead to more thrombopoetin destruction and thus less availability of thrombopoietin to bone marrow.

TPO, like EPO, plays a role in brain development. It promotes apoptosis of newly generated neurons, an effect counteracted by EPO and neurotrophins.

== Therapeutic use ==
Despite numerous trials, thrombopoietin has not been found to be useful therapeutically. Theoretical uses include the procurement of platelets for donation, and recovery of platelet counts after myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

Trials of a modified recombinant form, megakaryocyte growth and differentiation factor (MGDF), were stopped when healthy volunteers developed autoantibodies to endogenous thrombopoietin and then developed thrombocytopenia. Romiplostim and Eltrombopag, structurally different compounds that stimulate the same pathway, are used instead.

A quadrivalent peptide analogue is being investigated, as well as several small-molecule agents, and several non-peptide ligands of &quot;c-Mpl&quot;, which act as thrombopoietin analogues.

== Discovery ==
Thrombopoietin was cloned by five independent teams in 1994. Before its identification, its function has been hypothesized for as much as 30 years as being linked to the cell surface receptor &quot;c-Mpl&quot;, and in older publications &quot;thrombopoietin&quot; is described as &quot;c-Mpl ligand&quot; (the agent that binds to the c-Mpl molecule). Thrombopoietin is one of the Class I hematopoietic cytokines.

<text>Sir Monier Monier-Williams (; né Williams; 12 November 1819 – 11 April 1899) was a British scholar who was the second Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University, England. He studied, documented and taught Asian languages, especially Sanskrit, Persian and Hindustani.

==Early life==

Monier Williams was born in Bombay, the son of Colonel Monier Williams, surveyor-general in the Bombay presidency. His surname was &quot;Williams&quot; until 1887, when he added his given name to his surname to create the hyphenated &quot;Monier-Williams&quot;. In 1822, he was sent to England to be educated at private schools at Hove, Chelsea and Finchley. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School, Balliol College, Oxford (1838–40), the East India Company College (1840–41) and University College, Oxford (1841–44). He took a fourth-class honours degree in Literae Humaniores in 1844.

He married Julia Grantham, daughter of Rev. Francis Joseph Faithfull, in 1848. They had six sons and one daughter. He died, aged 79, in Cannes, France.

In 1874 he bought and lived in Enfield House, Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight where he and his family lived until at least 1881. (The 1881 census records the occupant was 61-year-old Professor Monier Monier-Williams; his wife, Julia; and two children, Montague (20) and Ella (22).)

==Career==

Monier Williams taught Asian languages at the East India Company College from 1844 until 1858 when company rule in India ended after the 1857 rebellion. He came to national prominence during the 1860 election campaign for the Boden Chair of Sanskrit at Oxford University, in which he stood against Max Müller.

The vacancy followed the death of Horace Hayman Wilson in 1860. Wilson had started the university&#x27;s collection of Sanskrit manuscripts upon taking the chair in 1831, and had indicated his preference that Williams should be his successor. The campaign was notoriously acrimonious. Müller was known for his liberal religious views and his philosophical speculations based on his reading of Vedic literature. Monier Williams was seen as a less brilliant scholar, but had a detailed practical knowledge of India itself, and of actual religious practices in modern Hinduism. Müller, in contrast, had never visited India.
Both candidates had to emphasise their support for Christian evangelisation in India, since that was the basis on which the professorship had been funded by its founder. Monier Williams&#x27; dedication to Christianisation was not doubted, unlike Müller&#x27;s. Monier Williams also stated that his aims were practical rather than speculative. &quot;Englishmen are too practical to study a language very philosophically&quot;, he wrote.

After his appointment to the professorship Williams declared from the outset that the conversion of India to the Christian religion should be one of the aims of orientalist scholarship. In his book &quot;Hinduism&quot;, published by SPCK in 1877, he predicted the demise of the Hindu religion and called for Christian evangelism to ward off the spread of Islam. According to Saurabh Dube this work is &quot;widely credited to have introduced the term Hinduism into general English usage&quot; while David N. Lorenzen cites the book along with &quot;India, and India Missions: Including Sketches of the Gigantic System of Hinduism, Both in Theory and Practice : Also Notices of Some of the Principal Agencies Employed in Conducting the Process of Indian Evangelization&quot;

==Writings and foundations==

When Monier Williams founded the University&#x27;s Indian Institute in 1883, it provided both an academic focus and also a training ground for the Indian Civil Service. Since the early 1870s Monier Williams planned this institution. His vision was the better acquaintance of England and India. On this account he supported academic research into Indian culture. Monier Williams travelled to India in 1875, 1876 and 1883 to finance his project by fundraising. He gained the support of Indian native princes. In 1883 the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone; the building was inaugurated in 1896 by Lord George Hamilton. The Institute closed on Indian independence in 1947.

In his writings on Hinduism Monier Williams argued that the Advaita Vedanta system best represented the Vedic ideal and was the &quot;highest way to salvation&quot; in Hinduism. He considered the more popular traditions of karma and bhakti to be of lesser spiritual value. However, he argued that Hinduism is a complex &quot;huge polygon or irregular multilateral figure&quot; that was unified by Sanskrit literature. He stated that &quot;no description of Hinduism can be exhaustive which does not touch on almost every religious and philosophical idea that the world has ever known.&quot;

Monier-Williams compiled a Sanskrit–English dictionary, based on the earlier &quot;Petersburg Sanskrit Dictionary&quot;, which was published in 1872. A later revised edition was published in 1899 with collaboration by Ernst Leumann and Carl Cappeller (sv).

==Honours==

He was knighted in 1876, and was made KCIE in 1887, when he adopted his given name of Monier as an additional surname. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1886.

He also received the following academic honours: Honorary DCL, Oxford, 1875; LLD, Calcutta, 1876; Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, 1880; Honorary PhD, Göttingen, 1880s; Vice-President, Royal Asiatic Society, 1890; Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, 1892.

<doc id="524457" wikidata="Q2399551" url="?curid=524457" title="Technology Student Association">
<text>The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national non-profit career and technical student organization (CTSO) of over 300,000 middle and high school student members engaged in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). TSA&#x27;s mission is to enhance personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.

== Competition ==
Competitive events are separated into middle school and high school levels, with students competing only with their respective age group. Competitions take place at the local, regional, state, and national level. A component of leadership is often entailed in events at both levels, with some events being devoted to leadership (such as Leadership Strategies MS).

All TSA competitions are correlated with national science, technology, engineering and mathematics and business standards. Sample middle school events include Biotechnology, Career Prep, Video Game Design, and Inventions and Innovations. High school events include Animatronics, Computer Aided Design (CAD), Dragster Design, Promotional Design, System Control Technology, Flight Endurance, Software Development, and Webmaster. For the 2022–2023 season Audio Podcasting, Drone Challenge (UAV), and Virtual Reality Visualization were added as high school events and the Cybersecurity event was removed. For the 2024-2025 season, Robotics and STEM Mass Media were added as high school events and VEX Robotics and Essays on Technology were removed.

Scores are based upon a nationally developed rubric. Winners are chosen based on these scores. In many events, semi-finalists (top 12) move onto a second round of competition which usually involves an interview with the judges about the project. First, second, and third-place winners are awarded a trophy, and finalists (top 10) are recognized at the national level.

===Program initiatives===

The Technology Student Association has partnered with many groups to promote other skills. Junior Solar Sprint is a national program allows students to design solar-powered cars. Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics, and Science (TEAMS) is an annual one-day competition. TSA has partnered with the VEX Robotics Competition to allow students to design and create robots to complete specific tasks. UNITE is a summer program funded by the U.S. Army Research Office that encourages high school students to pursue engineering careers. Every TSA middle school and high school member is required to submit LEAP (Leadership. Education. Achievement. Personal Growth.) documentation as part of every competition in which they compete. LEAP documentation tracks the leadership activities and experiences a TSA member has completed as part of each competition.

==History==
TSA became an independent organization in 1978, when AIASA Inc. was formed to oversee the activities of the American Industrial Arts Student Association. Between the foundation of AIASA as an independent organization (it had formerly been a part of the American Industrial Arts Association) and 1988, the association grew and began to take shape.

In 1988, the AIASA changed its name to the Technology Student Association as part of a shift in focus from industrial arts to mainstream technology. This action followed a similar name change by the Texas state delegation the previous year. In 1989, the official logo, submitted by a chapter advisor, was adopted. In 1990, the logo received a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Today, the association has grown to include more than 300,000 members in more than 2,300 secondary schools across 48 states. It has established an Honor Society, manages numerous competitive events and has partnerships with several organizations. Since TSA was chartered in 1978, more than five million students have participated as members.

As part of its national service project, TSA has a partnership with the American Cancer Society (ACS). TSA members raise money to help fund research, education, advocacy, and patient support. The ACS presents Spirit of Service awards to chapters that participate in fundraising.

==National conferences==
Students elect a National Officer team annually at the Technology Student Association national conference. The 2023 national conference was held at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky. The 2024 national conference was held at the Rosen Shingle Creek Resort in Orlando, Florida. The 2025 national conference will be held at the Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

<text>Davíð Stefánsson (21 January 1895 – 1 March 1964) was an Icelandic poet and novelist, best known for his ten volumes of poetry.

He was born on 21 January 1895, in Fagriskógur, Eyjafjörður, Iceland and he died on 1 March 1964, in Akureyri, Iceland.

Davíð came of a cultured yeoman family and was brought up with a love for his homeland, its literature, and its folklore. He frequently journeyed abroad but lived most of his life in the town of Akureyri, where he was a librarian (1925–52).

==Novels and plays==
In 1926, he wrote &quot;Munkarnir á Möðruvöllum&quot; (&quot;The Monks of Möðruvellir&quot;) and in 1941, the powerful novel &quot;Sólon Islandus&quot; (I - II), a novel about Sölvi Helgason, a daydreaming 19th-century vagabond whose intellectual ambitions are smothered by society.

In 1941, he wrote the successful play, &quot;Gullna hliðið&quot; (&quot;The Golden Gate&quot;) and in 1944, &quot;Vopn guðanna&quot; (&quot;Weapons of the Gods&quot;) and in 1953, his play &quot;Landið gleymda&quot; (&quot;The Forgotten Country&quot;).

==Poetry==
Davíð&#x27;s early poetry, including most of his folk themes and love lyrics, appeared in:
*1919: &quot;Svartar fjaðrir&quot; (&quot;Black Feathers&quot;)
*1922: &quot;Kvæði&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;)
*1924: &quot;Kveðjur&quot; (&quot;Greetings&quot;)
*1929: &quot;Ný Kvæði&quot; (&quot;New Poems&quot;)

They were combined and published as a collected volume in 1930.

His later poetry—darkening in social satire, reformatory zeal against capitalism and organized religion, and despair over the war—was published as:
*1933: &quot;Í byggðum&quot; (&quot;Among Human Habitations&quot;)
*1936: &quot;Að norðan&quot; (&quot;From the North&quot;)
*1947: &quot;Ný kvæðabók&quot; (&quot;A New Book of Poems&quot;)
*1966: &quot;Síðustu ljóð&quot; (&quot;Last Poems&quot;) (posthumously)

<doc id="524461" wikidata="Q80594" url="?curid=524461" title="Self-destruct">
<text>A self-destruct is a mechanism that can cause an object to destroy itself or render itself inoperable after a predefined set of circumstances has occurred.

Self-destruct mechanisms are typically found on devices and systems where malfunction could endanger large numbers of people.

==Uses==
===Land mines===

Some types of modern land mines are designed to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of friendly casualties during the conflict or civilian casualties after the conflict&#x27;s end. The Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), amended in 1996, requires that anti-personnel land mines deactivate and self-destruct, and sets standards for both. Landmines currently used by the United States military are designed to self-destruct after between 4 hours and 15 days depending upon the type. The landmines have a battery and when the battery dies, the land mine self-destructs. The self-destruct system never failed in over 67,000 tested landmines in a variety of conditions. Not all self-destruct mechanisms are absolutely reliable, and most landmines that have been laid throughout history are not equipped to self-destruct. Landmines can also be designed to self-deactivate, for instance by a battery running out of a charge, but deactivation is considered a different mechanism from self-destruction.

===Military ships===
Another form of a self-destruct system can be seen in the naval procedure of scuttling, which is used to destroy a ship or ships to prevent them from being seized and/or reverse engineered.

Generally the scuttling of a ship uses strategically-placed explosive charges by a demolition crew and/or the deliberate cutting open of the hull rather than an in-built self-destruct system.

===Rockets===

Launch vehicles self-destruct when they go errant, to prevent the endangerment of nearby ground personnel, spectators, buildings and infrastructure. When a rocket flies outside of a prescribed safety zone, personnel monitoring the launch or onboard computers activate the rocket&#x27;s flight termination system. This usually detonates explosives mounted on the rocket, which sever its propellant tanks or solid fuel casing, leading to a controlled breakup of the vehicle. 

===Anti-aircraft cannon shells===

Since anti-aircraft weapons are used in the home front or in the rear of friendly forces anti-aircraft cannon shells are often equipped with self-destruct mechanisms to prevent missed shots from falling down and causing damage to friendly targets. Different self-destruct types exists: in tracer ammunition the burning tracer material can trigger a self-destruct fuse at the end. Other self-destruct types are mechanical where a spring is held back by the centrifugal force of the rotating projectile; as the drag slows down the rotation the force is eventually no longer able to prevent the spring from triggering the self-destruct fuse. Heavy anti-aircraft cannons typically fired time fused shells which did not need a separate self-destruct since they were intended to detonate in the air after a set time.

===Deep-sea oil drilling===
A form of self-destruct system can also be observed in deep-sea oil drilling. In the event of an oil well becoming disconnected from its oil rig, a dead man&#x27;s switch may trigger activation of a blowout preventer blind shear ram, which cuts the drill pipe and permanently seals the well to prevent an oil leak. The oil spill that followed the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; explosion is an example where the self-destruct system failed to operate correctly (due to the pipe buckling and moving outside of the blind shear ram&#x27;s reach).

===Data storage===
Self-destruct mechanisms are sometimes employed to prevent an apparatus or information from being used by unauthorized persons in the event of loss or capture. For example, they may be found in high-security data storage devices (e.g. IronKey), where it is important for the data to be destroyed to prevent compromise.

Similarly, some online social media platforms are equipped with a &quot;Stories&quot; feature, where posted content is automatically erased after a predetermined time, commonly 24 hours. This concept has been popularized by Snapchat and later adapted by Instagram and YouTube.

=== Artwork ===
Some artworks may have mechanisms in them to destruct themselves in front of many eyes watching. An example is the painting Love is in the Bin by Banksy, which shredded itself right after a £1 million auction at Sotheby&#x27;s London on 5 October 2018.

==Use in fiction==
In the 1960s television series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and &quot;&quot;, sensitive intelligence or equipment is shown to self-destruct in order to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Notably, the usage of &quot;self-destruct&quot; as a verb is said to have been coined on &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;.

Self-destruct mechanisms are frequent plot devices in science fiction stories, such as those in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Alien&quot; fictional universes. They are generally found on military installations and starships too valuable to allow an enemy to capture. In many such stories, these mechanisms not only obliterate the object protected by the device, but cause massive destruction in a large surrounding area. Often, the characters have a limited amount of time to escape the destruction, or to disable the mechanism, creating story tension. In some cases, an artificial intelligence will invoke self-destruct due to cognitive dissonance.

Usually the method required to initiate a self-destruct sequence is lengthy and complex, as in &quot;Alien&quot;, or else requires multiple officers aboard the ship with individual passcodes to concur, while audible and/or visible countdown timers allow audiences to track the growing urgency of the characters&#x27; escape. Passwords in 1970s and 1980s movies are often clearly insecure for their purposes as self-destruct triggers, considering accounts with even low-level security—let alone the high-security measures which would come for a self-destruct mechanism—in modern times generally have far more complex password requirements (the writers of the era not anticipating the issues soon to be raised by the easy affordability of fast computer hardware for conducting brute-force attacks).

<text>In graph theory, a clique ( or ) is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. That is, a clique of a graph formula_1 is an induced subgraph of formula_1 that is complete. Cliques are one of the basic concepts of graph theory and are used in many other mathematical problems and constructions on graphs. Cliques have also been studied in computer science: the task of finding whether there is a clique of a given size in a graph (the clique problem) is NP-complete, but despite this hardness result, many algorithms for finding cliques have been studied.

Although the study of complete subgraphs goes back at least to the graph-theoretic reformulation of Ramsey theory by , the term &quot;clique&quot; comes from , who used complete subgraphs in social networks to model cliques of people; that is, groups of people all of whom know each other. Cliques have many other applications in the sciences and particularly in bioinformatics.

==Definitions==
A clique, , in an undirected graph is a subset of the vertices, , such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent. This is equivalent to the condition that the induced subgraph of induced by is a complete graph. In some cases, the term clique may also refer to the subgraph directly.

A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, that is, a clique which does not exist exclusively within the vertex set of a larger clique. Some authors define cliques in a way that requires them to be maximal, and use other terminology for complete subgraphs that are not maximal.

A maximum clique of a graph, , is a clique, such that there is no clique with more vertices. Moreover, the clique number of a graph is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in .

The intersection number of is the smallest number of cliques that together cover all edges of .

The clique cover number of a graph is the smallest number of cliques of whose union covers the set of vertices of the graph.

A maximum clique transversal of a graph is a subset of vertices with the property that each maximum clique of the graph contains at least one vertex in the subset.

The opposite of a clique is an independent set, in the sense that every clique corresponds to an independent set in the complement graph. The clique cover problem concerns finding as few cliques as possible that include every vertex in the graph.

A related concept is a biclique, a complete bipartite subgraph. The bipartite dimension of a graph is the minimum number of bicliques needed to cover all the edges of the graph.

==Mathematics==
Mathematical results concerning cliques include the following.
* Turán&#x27;s theorem gives a lower bound on the size of a clique in dense graphs. If a graph has sufficiently many edges, it must contain a large clique. For instance, every graph with formula_3 vertices and more than formula_4 edges must contain a three-vertex clique.
* Ramsey&#x27;s theorem states that every graph or its complement graph contains a clique with at least a logarithmic number of vertices.
* According to a result of , a graph with 3&quot;n&quot; vertices can have at most 3&quot;n&quot; maximal cliques. The graphs meeting this bound are the Moon–Moser graphs &quot;K&quot;3,3..., a special case of the Turán graphs arising as the extremal cases in Turán&#x27;s theorem.
* Hadwiger&#x27;s conjecture, still unproven, relates the size of the largest clique minor in a graph (its Hadwiger number) to its chromatic number.
* The Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture relates graph coloring to cliques.
* The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture states that families of graphs defined by forbidden graph characterization have either large cliques or large cocliques. 

Several important classes of graphs may be defined or characterized by their cliques:
* A cluster graph is a graph whose connected components are cliques.
* A block graph is a graph whose biconnected components are cliques.
* A chordal graph is a graph whose vertices can be ordered into a perfect elimination ordering, an ordering such that the neighbors of each vertex &quot;v&quot; that come later than &quot;v&quot; in the ordering form a clique.
* A cograph is a graph all of whose induced subgraphs have the property that any maximal clique intersects any maximal independent set in a single vertex.
* An interval graph is a graph whose maximal cliques can be ordered in such a way that, for each vertex &quot;v&quot;, the cliques containing &quot;v&quot; are consecutive in the ordering.
* A line graph is a graph whose edges can be covered by edge-disjoint cliques in such a way that each vertex belongs to exactly two of the cliques in the cover.
* A perfect graph is a graph in which the clique number equals the chromatic number in every induced subgraph.
* A split graph is a graph in which some clique contains at least one endpoint of every edge.
* A triangle-free graph is a graph that has no cliques other than its vertices and edges.

Additionally, many other mathematical constructions involve cliques in graphs. Among them,
* The clique complex of a graph &quot;G&quot; is an abstract simplicial complex &quot;X&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with a simplex for every clique in &quot;G&quot;
* A simplex graph is an undirected graph κ(&quot;G&quot;) with a vertex for every clique in a graph &quot;G&quot; and an edge connecting two cliques that differ by a single vertex. It is an example of median graph, and is associated with a median algebra on the cliques of a graph: the median &quot;m&quot;(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) of three cliques &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; is the clique whose vertices belong to at least two of the cliques &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;.
* The clique-sum is a method for combining two graphs by merging them along a shared clique.
* Clique-width is a notion of the complexity of a graph in terms of the minimum number of distinct vertex labels needed to build up the graph from disjoint unions, relabeling operations, and operations that connect all pairs of vertices with given labels. The graphs with clique-width one are exactly the disjoint unions of cliques.
* The intersection number of a graph is the minimum number of cliques needed to cover all the graph&#x27;s edges.
* The clique graph of a graph is the intersection graph of its maximal cliques.

Closely related concepts to complete subgraphs are subdivisions of complete graphs and complete graph minors. In particular, Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem and Wagner&#x27;s theorem characterize planar graphs by forbidden complete and complete bipartite subdivisions and minors, respectively.

==Computer science==

In computer science, the clique problem is the computational problem of finding a maximum clique, or all cliques, in a given graph. It is NP-complete, one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems. It is also fixed-parameter intractable, and hard to approximate. Nevertheless, many algorithms for computing cliques have been developed, either running in exponential time (such as the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm) or specialized to graph families such as planar graphs or perfect graphs for which the problem can be solved in polynomial time.

==Applications==
The word &quot;clique&quot;, in its graph-theoretic usage, arose from the work of , who used complete subgraphs to model cliques (groups of people who all know each other) in social networks. The same definition was used by in an article using less technical terms. Both works deal with uncovering cliques in a social network using matrices. For continued efforts to model social cliques graph-theoretically, see e.g. , , and .

Many different problems from bioinformatics have been modeled using cliques. For instance, model the problem of clustering gene expression data as one of finding the minimum number of changes needed to transform a graph describing the data into a graph formed as the disjoint union of cliques; discuss a similar biclustering problem for expression data in which the clusters are required to be cliques. uses cliques to model ecological niches in food webs. describe the problem of inferring evolutionary trees as one of finding maximum cliques in a graph that has as its vertices characteristics of the species, where two vertices share an edge if there exists a perfect phylogeny combining those two characters. model protein structure prediction as a problem of finding cliques in a graph whose vertices represent positions of subunits of the protein. And by searching for cliques in a protein–protein interaction network, found clusters of proteins that interact closely with each other and have few interactions with proteins outside the cluster. Power graph analysis is a method for simplifying complex biological networks by finding cliques and related structures in these networks.

In electrical engineering, uses cliques to analyze communications networks, and use them to design efficient circuits for computing partially specified Boolean functions. Cliques have also been used in automatic test pattern generation: a large clique in an incompatibility graph of possible faults provides a lower bound on the size of a test set. describe an application of cliques in finding a hierarchical partition of an electronic circuit into smaller subunits.

In chemistry, use cliques to describe chemicals in a chemical database that have a high degree of similarity with a target structure. use cliques to model the positions in which two chemicals will bind to each other.

<text>Baron Adrien Victor Joseph de Gerlache de Gomery (; 2 August 1866 – 4 December 1934) was a Belgian officer in the Belgian Royal Navy who led the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–99.

==Early years==
Born in Hasselt in eastern Belgium as the son of an army officer, de Gerlache was educated in Brussels. From a young age, he was deeply attracted by the sea, and made three voyages in 1883 and 1884 to the United States as a cabin boy on an ocean liner. He studied engineering at the Free University of Brussels. After finishing his third year in 1885, he quit the university and joined the Belgian Navy on 19 January 1886.
After graduating from the nautical college of Ostend he worked on fishery protection vessels as second and third lieutenant. In October 1887 he signed on as a seaman on the &quot;Craigie Burn&quot;, an English ship, for a voyage to San Francisco, but the ship failed to round Cape Horn and was sold for scrap in Montevideo. He returned to Europe after spending time in Uruguay and Argentina. After a trip to Constantinople and the Black Sea, he worked for the Holland-America Line as fourth officer, before obtaining an appointment as lieutenant in the Belgian Navy. Until July 1894 he was an officer on Ostend-Dover ferries, meanwhile taking courses and becoming a captain on 22 August 1894.

Frustrated by the monotonous work aboard the Ostend-Dover ferries, de Gerlache offered his services to Belgian King Leopold II and Welsh-American adventurer Henry Morton Stanley, for an expedition to the Congo, but the offer was turned down. A letter to polar explorer Otto Nordenskiöld went unanswered. Finally he started planning and promoting his own Antarctic expedition, proposing his plan in 1894 to the Belgian Royal Geographical Society.

==First expedition==

In 1896, de Gerlache purchased the Norwegian-built whaling ship &quot;Patria&quot;, which he extensively refitted and renamed &quot;Belgica&quot;. With a multinational crew including Roald Amundsen, Frederick Cook, Antoni Bolesław Dobrowolski, Henryk Arctowski and Emil Racoviță, he set sail from Antwerp on 16 August 1897.

The &quot;Belgica&quot; reached the coast of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula in January 1898. Sailing between the Graham Land coast and a string of islands to the west, de Gerlache named the passage Belgica Strait. This strait was later renamed Gerlache Strait in his honour. After charting and naming several islands during some 20 separate landings, they crossed the Antarctic Circle on 15 February 1898.
On 28 February 1898, de Gerlache&#x27;s expedition became trapped in the ice of the Bellinghausen Sea, near Peter I Island. Despite their efforts, they quickly realised that they would be forced to spend the winter in Antarctica. Total darkness set in on 17 May, lasting until 23 July. Another seven months of hardship followed as the crew laboured to free the vessel from the ice. Several men lost their sanity, including one Belgian sailor who left the ship &quot;announcing he was going back to Belgium&quot;. The party also suffered from scurvy.

On 15 February 1899, the vessel was able to begin moving through the channel that the crew had cleared. It took them nearly a month to cover 7 miles, and on 14 March they cleared the ice. The expedition returned to Antwerp on 5 November 1899. In 1902, de Gerlache&#x27;s book &quot;Quinze Mois dans l&#x27;Antarctique&quot; (&#x27;Fifteen Months in Antarctica&#x27;), published in 1901, was awarded a prize by the Académie française.

The fungi collected during the expedition were described in a paper published in 1905 by Marietta Hanson Rousseau and Elisa Caroline Bommer.

==Later years==
de Gerlache participated in several other expeditions, including:
* a commercial and scientific expedition to the Persian Gulf in 1901
* the first Antarctic expedition (1903-1905) of Jean-Baptiste Charcot. de Gerlache began on this voyage but returned to Belgium when the ship reached Madeira
* expedition to the Greenland Sea on board the &quot;Belgica&quot; (1905)
* expedition to the Barents Sea and Kara Sea (1907)
* expedition to Greenland, Spitsbergen and the Franz Jozef archipelago on board the &quot;Belgica&quot; (1909)

He had two children with his first wife, Suzanne Poulet, whom he married in 1904: Philippe (born 1906) and Marie-Louise (born 1908). After this marriage ended in 1913, de Gerlache married Elisabeth Höjer from Sweden. With her, he had another son, the explorer Gaston de Gerlache in 1919. In the 1950s, Gaston followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, participating in a Belgian research station in Antarctica.

Adrien de Gerlache died in Brussels in 1934, aged 68, from paratyphoid fever.

==Tributes==
Several geographical features were named in his honour, mostly in Antarctica: Cape Gerlache, Mount Gerlache, Gerlache Inlet, Gerlache Island, Gerlache Strait and the de Gerlache seamounts, as well as Pic de Gerlache in Greenland and de Gerlache crater, near the lunar south pole. One of Antwerp&#x27;s quays is named De Gerlachekaai.

<doc id="524469" wikidata="Q1542855" url="?curid=524469" title="Grand River (Ontario)">
<text>The Grand River, formerly known as the River Ouse, is a large river in Ontario, Canada. It lies along the western fringe of the Greater Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario which overlaps the eastern portion of southwestern Ontario, sometimes referred to as Midwestern Ontario, along the length of this river. From its source near Wareham, Ontario, it flows south through Grand Valley, Fergus, Elora, Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge, Paris, Brantford, Ohsweken, Six Nations of the Grand River, Caledonia, and Cayuga before emptying into the north shore of Lake Erie south of Dunnville at Port Maitland. One of the scenic and spectacular features of the river is the falls and Gorge at Elora.

The Grand River is the largest river that is entirely within southern Ontario&#x27;s boundaries. The river owes its size to the unusual fact that its source is relatively close to the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, yet it flows southwards to Lake Erie, rather than westward to the closer Lake Huron or northward to Georgian Bay (most southern Ontario rivers flow into the nearest Great Lake, which is why most of them are small), thus giving it more distance to take in more water from tributaries.

The river&#x27;s mostly rural character (even when flowing through the edges of Waterloo and Kitchener), ease of access and lack of portages make it a desirable canoeing location, especially the stretch between West Montrose and Paris. A number of conservation areas have been established along the river, and are managed by the Grand River Conservation Authority.

The Grand Valley Trail stretches 275 km along the river&#x27;s valley between the town of Dundalk and Lake Erie.

In 1669 the indigenous name &quot;Tinaouatoua&quot; was recorded by Galinée. A 1945 book about the Grand River recorded the spelling &#x27;Tinaatoua&#x27; and attributed it to the Seneca, though its sources are unclear.

The Mohawk name for the Grand River, &quot;O:se Kenhionhata:tie&quot; means &quot;Willow River,&quot; for the many willows in the watershed. During the 18th century, the French colonists named it &quot;Grande-Rivière.&quot; &quot;It was later renamed as Ouse River by John Graves Simcoe for the River Great Ouse near his childhood home in Lincolnshire on the east coast of England. The anglicized form of the French name has remained in common use.&quot;

The Ojibwe name for Grand River is Owaashtanong-ziibi. A. Jones, the General Surveyor of Upper Canada reported the name of the river among the Mississaugas to be &#x27;O-es-shin-ne-gun-ing&#x27;, and he wrote &quot;the one that washes the timber down and carries away the grass and the weeds&quot; as the meaning of the name.

==Watershed==

The Grand River watershed consists of all the land that drains into the Grand River through tributary creeks and rivers such as the Conestogo, Speed, Eramosa, Irvine and Nith rivers. The Grand River has Southern Ontario&#x27;s largest watershed.

Because the watershed is an ecosystem with natural borders, it includes and crosses many municipal boundaries and can be considered a transitional area between Southwestern Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe region that surrounds the west end of Lake Ontario. Its headwaters are near Dundalk in the north. The Grand River flows south-south-east.

Luther Marsh, a 52-square-kilometre wetland on the upper Grand, is one of the largest inland wetlands in southern Ontario and provides habitat for waterfowl, including least bittern and black tern, and amphibians. It is also an important staging area during bird migrations. The importance of the watershed (7000 square kilometers or 2600 square miles) has been recognized by the designation of the Grand as a Canadian Heritage River.

The Grand Valley Dam, located near the village of Belwood, helps to control the flow of water, especially during periods of spring flooding. The dam, completed in 1942, is commonly referred to as Shand Dam, named for a local family who were displaced by filling of the dam&#x27;s reservoir, Lake Belwood.

===Lakes, creeks and rivers===
With a watershed area of , the Grand River flows from Dundalk to Lake Erie with numerous tributaries flowing into it:

* Canagagigue Creek
* Chilligo Creek
* Conestogo River
* Eramosa River
* Fairchild Creek
* Idlewood Creek
* Irvine Creek
* Knob Creek
* Laurel Creek
* McKenzie Creek
* Mill Creek
* Moffat Creek
* Nith River
* Schneider Creek
* Speed River
* Spencer Creek
* Whitemans Creek

The Conestogo River joins the Grand at the village of Conestogo just north of Waterloo. The Eramosa River joins the Speed River in Guelph. The Speed River joins the Grand in Cambridge. The Nith River joins the Grand in Paris.

===Pre-Laurentide hydrology===

Prior to the most recent glaciation—the Laurentide—an earlier river flowed through a gorge roughly parallel to the current Grand River.
Evidence of the &quot;buried gorge&quot; of the previous river has been found when wells have been drilled. Rather than finding water-bearing bedrock at a depth of a dozen metres or less, the path of the buried gorge can be found with overburden of dozens of metres.

==History==
===Prehistory===

====Archaic period====

The Laphroaig site (AgHa-54) on the lower Grand River shows evidence of occupation in the latter part of the Early Archaic period.

During the Late Archaic period ( RCYBP to RCYBP), water levels in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario were higher due to drainage reasons as the land continued to deglaciate. The people of the Late Archaic were mobile hunter-gatherers who had not yet developed ceramics. While Late Archaic people in what is now southern Ontario used a variety of projectile point types, one distinct type, the Innes point, was associated with the Grand River drainage basin and took its name from a type site a few kilometres west of Brantford, which sits on the lower Grand River. Due to high water levels at the start of the Late Archaic, sites which are today located inland up the river may once have been true shoreline sites, similarly to the phenomenon of site stratification observed on Lake Huron. This phenomenon is also observable in reference to Lake Erie. For example, the Canada Century site (located on the Welland River) lies north of the Lake Erie shore, but may once have been significantly closer.

Due to the absence of ceramics, it is difficult to date Archaic sites. It is generally believed that sites were occupied seasonally, though there are notable exceptions to this. The archaeologist Chris Ellis argues that in the 1950s and 1960s, there was a tendency for archaeologists in eastern North America to identify sedentarization with progress on a conceptual level. Some sites may have had a number of distinct occupations, occurring in different seasons and for different purposes. Nevertheless, there is a broad grouping of sites into warm-weather, lowland sites characterized by ground stone tools and fishing equipment, or cold-weather, upland sites with abundant scrapers and projectile points, possibly indicating fall and winter deer hunting activities. Evidence of Late Archaic fishing activities in Ontario is concentrated at lakeshore sites located at river mouths; no known site of this type, however, has been located on the Grand River. No evidence of fish at upland sites has been found, suggesting a pattern of seasonal upland hunting and lowland fishing. Tincombe points out, however, that fishing may still have occurred on the upper Grand River, notwithstanding a lack of surviving remains at sites. He further proposes areas around Caledonia and Brantford as persistent places of occupation in the Late Archaic, due to a high concentration of consecutively dated sites from that period. One especially significant site, the Johnson Flats site (Borden AgGx-214), is located on a former bar in the Grand River near Caledonia. Discovered in 1994, the site contains materials dating to the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods, as well as the later Princess Point complex.

====Woodland period====
The people of the Princess Point complex ( CE – 1000 CE) are strongly associated with the Grand River by archaeologists. Princess Point sites cluster heavily along the river&#x27;s length, where the focus and concentration of Princess Point people shifted from their earlier territory around Princess Point near Hamilton. Princess Point people were attracted to the fertile Grand River floodplains, in common with other peoples engaging in maize horticulture around the same time. Floodplains provided rich soils for cultivation, as well as easy access to riverine resources. Indeed, early evidence of lake sturgeon fishing on the Grand River has been discovered at the Cayuga Bridge site, which is also associated with the Princess Point complex and dated to AD 700900. Thousands of fish remains were also unearthed at the Porteous and Holmedale sites near Brantford, which date to around AD 1000.

===Protohistoric period===

By the 16th and 17th centuries, the Grand River valley was inhabited by the Neutral people. This was a name given to them by European settlers, as they refused to side with either the Iroquois or the Petun tribes during their conflicts in the area. An Iroquoian people, they had close trade and cultural relations with other Ontario Iroquoian societies such as the Huron and Petun.

The Wyandot, another distinct Iroquoian-speaking nation, who resided northeast of the Grand River valley, had long competed to remain independent of their enemy the Iroquois Confederacy, a powerful alliance of five nations based around the Great Lakes in the present central and western New York state area. Caught in between, the Neutrals paid dearly for their refusal to ally. Historical accounts differ on exactly how the Neutral tribe was wiped out. The consensus is that the Seneca and the Mohawk nations of the Iroquois destroyed the smaller Neutral tribe in the 17th century, in the course of attacking and severely crippling the Huron/Wyandot. The Iroquois were seeking to dominate the lucrative fur trade with the Europeans. It was during this warfare that the Iroquois attacked the Jesuit outpost of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons. The Jesuits abandoned the mission after many Wyandot and numerous priests were killed here.

To survive, remnants of The Neutral tribe migrated in 1667 to &quot;La Prairie&quot; (&quot;Caughnawaga&quot; or Kahnawake), a Catholic mission settlement just south of Montreal that was occupied primarily by converted Mohawk who had migrated north from New York. In 1674 identifiable groups of Neutrals were recorded among its population. It can be presumed that many of their descendants are still living there today. In later wars between Britain and France, the Caughnawaga people, many of whom had converted to Catholicism, were allies of the French. The Iroquois League in New York then was neutral or sided with the British. Because different nations were on different sides in this war, it was difficult for the Iroquois nations to adhere to the Great Law of Peace and avoid killing each other. They managed to avoid such bloodshed until the American Revolution (1775–83).

Other descendants of the Neutrals may have joined the Mingo, a loose confederacy of peoples who moved west in the 1720s, fleeing lands invaded by Iroquois, and settled in present-day Ohio. The Mingo were among tribes who later fought the Americans in the Northwest Indian Wars for the Ohio Valley (1774–95). During the 1840s, they were among the tribes removed to Oklahoma and Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Neutral descendants are among the people now known as the Seneca in Oklahoma.

After the desolation of the Neutral tribe, the Iroquois Confederacy used the Grand River Valley as a hunting ground and trapping territory. Though the Six Nations (by then including the Tuscarora) held the territory by right of conquest, they did not settle it, apart from a limited presence on the northern and western shores of Lake Ontario.

When the French explorers and &quot;Coureurs de bois&quot; came to the region in search of fur and other items of value to Europeans, the Grand River Valley was among the last areas of southern Ontario to be explored. Since the French worked closely with their Native allies in the acquisition of fur and trading of European goods for it, they went only where the natives resided. Even after the English conquered New France in 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Grand River Valley remained largely unoccupied and largely uncharted.

An explorers&#x27; map in 1669 showed the River as being called the Tinaatuoa or Riviere Rapide. A 1775 map shows it as Urse, a name which also appeared on a 1708 map and on Bellin’s Carte des Lacs of 1744. The d’Anville map of 1755 shows the river Tinaatuoa but adds the words Grande River at its mouth. Other 18th Century names were Oswego and Swaogeh. In 1792, Simcoe tried to change the name of Grande Riviere to Ouse, after a river in England and the Thomas Ridout map of 1821 shows &quot;Grand R or Ouse&quot;. Simcoe failed because the name Grand River had been in common usage for some time by then.

===Six Nations of the Grand River===

Apart from large numbers of Tuscarora and Oneida, who mainly allied with the American colonists, the other four nations of the Iroquois Confederacy sided with the British during the American War of Independence. Warfare throughout the frontier of the Mohawk Valley had resulted in massacres and atrocities on both sides, aggravating anti-Iroquois feelings among the colonists. Without consultation or giving the Iroquois a place in negotiations, the British ceded their land in New York to the new United States.

The Iroquois were unwelcome in the newly created nation. After the war, Six Nations leader Joseph Brant appealed to the British Crown for help, as they had promised aid for allies. In gratitude for their assistance during the war, the Crown awarded the Iroquois land in Upper Canada. Brant led Mohawk from the Upper Castle and families of the other Six Nations to Upper Canada. They first settled at what is present-day Brantford, where Brant crossed, or ‘forded’ the Grand River. It was also called Brant&#x27;s Town. Not all members of the Six Nations moved north. Remnants of the past confederacy live today throughout New York state, some on federally recognized reservations. 
In 1784 the British Crown awarded to the Six Nations the &quot;Haldimand Tract&quot;, a tract of land &quot;six miles deep from each side of the river beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the [source] of the said river.&quot; Much of this land was later sold or otherwise lost to the Six Nations.

A portion of this tract near Caledonia, Ontario, is the basis for the 2006 Caledonia land dispute, in which the Six Nations filed a land claim with the government. The Six Nations reserve south of Brantford, Ontario, is what remains of the Haldimand Tract. Throughout the 19th century, many Anglo-Canadian settlements developed along the Grand within former Six Nations territory, including Waterloo, Berlin (now Kitchener), Cambridge, Paris, Brantford, Caledonia, Dunnville and Port Maitland.

After the American War of Independence, the Crown purchased land from the &quot;Mississaugas&quot; in Upper Canada to award as grants to Loyalist refugees as compensation for their property losses in the colonies. Loyalists from New York, New England and the South were settled in this area, as the Crown hoped they would create new towns and farms on the frontier. In the 19th century, many new immigrants came to Upper Canada from England, Scotland, Ireland and Germany seeking opportunity. Settlements were popping up all over Southern Ontario, and many colonists coveted the prize Grand River Valley.

The 1846 Gazetteer relates the history of the First Nations of the area as follows:
&quot;In 1784, Sir F. Haldimand ... granted to the Six Nations and their heirs for ever, a tract of land on the Ouse, or Grand River, six miles in depth on each side of the river, beginning at Lake Erie, and extending to the head of the river. This grant was confirmed, and its conditions defined, by a patent under the Great Seal, issued by Lieutenant Governor Simcoe, and bearing date January 14, 1793 ... The original extent of the tract was 694,910 acres, but the greater part of this has been since surrendered to the Crown, in trust, to be sold for the benefit of these tribes. And some smaller portions have been either granted in fee simple to purchasers with the assent of the Indians, or have been alienated by the chiefs upon leases; which, although legally invalid, the government did not at the time consider it equitable or expedient to cancel.&quot;

<text>Gold Box is a series of role-playing video games produced by Strategic Simulations from 1988 to 1992. The company acquired a license to produce games based on the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game from TSR, Inc. These games share a common game engine that came to be known as the &quot;Gold Box Engine&quot; after the gold-colored boxes in which most games of the series were sold.

==History==
===Licensing and development===
In the mid-1980s TSR, after seeing the success of the &quot;Ultima&quot; series and other computer role-playing games (CRPGs), offered its popular &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) property to video game companies. Ten companies, including Electronic Arts, &quot;Ultima&quot; creator Origin Systems, and Sierra Entertainment applied for the license. Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI) president Joel Billings had, along with many other companies, earlier contacted TSR about licensing &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, but TSR was not interested at that time. Although smaller and less technically advanced than other bidders, SSI unexpectedly won the license in 1987 because of its computerized wargaming experience, and instead of releasing a single &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game as soon as possible, the company proposed a broad vision of multiple series of games and spinoffs that might become as sophisticated as TSR&#x27;s tabletop original.

After winning the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; license, the number of SSI&#x27;s in-house developers increased from seven to 25, including the company&#x27;s first full-time computer-graphic artists. TSR significantly participated in the games&#x27; development, including designing a tabletop module on which the first SSI game would be based. Using &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown″s&quot; detailed combat system as a base for their work, the development of the Gold Box engine and the original games was managed by SSI&#x27;s Chuck Kroegel and George MacDonald. Later versions were led by Victor Penman and Ken Humphries.

===The series===

The first game produced in the series was &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, released in 1988. This was followed by &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; (1989), &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot; (1990), and &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; (1991), the games forming one continuous story rooted in the once-glorious city of Phlan, later encompassing the entire Moonsea Reaches and four outer regions: Dalelands, Cormyr, Cormanthyr (where Myth Drannor is located), and Thar. The original four titles were developed in-house at SSI, and the first three titles were the best selling Gold Box games. A series of TSR novels paralleled the stories in the games.

Released in 1990, &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot; was the first of SSI&#x27;s Gold Box spin-offs based on TSR&#x27;s very popular &quot;Dragonlance&quot; universe, and roughly in the novels by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. Chronologically, it was the third Gold Box game and employed some innovations that showed up in later games, like the moon phases for mages, the choice of deities for clerics, and the level difficulty selector. The following titles were &quot;Death Knights of Krynn&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Dark Queen of Krynn&quot; (1992). While the games give players a chance to meet &quot;Dragonlance&quot; characters like Tanis Half-Elven and Raistlin Majere, the gameplay is far more linear.

When SSI began working on the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; game in 1989, all the programmers in-house had to stop the development of Gold Box games and start working on the Dark Sun engine. After &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot; came out, Chuck Kroegel passed the Gold Box engine and the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; location to Beyond Software (later Stormfront Studios). They set their first &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; Gold Box title, &quot;Gateway to the Savage Frontier&quot; (1991), in the Savage Frontier, an area to the extreme west of the previous games location. Following the events of the first game, &quot;Treasures of the Savage Frontier&quot; (1992) added a weather system and an innovative romance system between party members and NPCs.

SSI also adapted the Gold Box engine from fantasy to science fiction for a pair of Buck Rogers games: &quot;Countdown to Doomsday&quot; (1990) and &quot;Matrix Cubed&quot; (1992). They were based on the Buck Rogers XXVc tabletop RPG by TSR, with rules heavily based on those of the company&#x27;s flagship game. According to Keith Brors (former technical director of SSI), the company was pressured by TSR into developing their Buck Rogers computer game against their better judgment, due to TSR president Lorraine Williams personally owning the Buck Rogers IP. The games did not perform as well as the fantasy settings, but they do represent some enhancements to the Gold Box engine.

Apart from the main games, &quot;&quot; was launched in 1992. Based on the 2nd edition&#x27;s Spelljammer rule set, it combined real-time ship combat, turn-based melee battles, and interplanetary trade. Besides the innovations, many gamers and critics took issue with its occasional bugs and lengthy load times.

Sales declined over time, as the engine—originally designed for the Commodore 64—aged, and SSI released too many games (11 Gold Box games over four years). When SSI and TSR extended the original contract expiring in January 1993 for 18 months, SSI was required to discontinue the engine, moving to new developing technologies. In March of the same year, SSI&#x27;s last release was &quot;Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures&quot;, an editor that allows players to create their own games using the Gold Box engine. Game developers had access to 127 different monsters, 100 different event triggers, and a framework that could hold an adventure consisting of four different wilderness areas or 36 dungeon levels. It also included a mini-adventure called &quot;The Heirs to Skull Crag&quot;. An active community grew up around this game, including hacks that expanded its powers and its graphical capabilities.

===Spin-off to MMO===
All of the online RPGs of the 1980s were text-based MUDs, describing the action in the style of &quot;Rogue&quot; or Will Crowther&#x27;s original &quot;Adventure&quot; game. Stormfront&#x27;s Don Daglow had been designing games for AOL for several years, and the new alliance of SSI, TSR, America On-Line, and Stormfront led to the development of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, the first graphical MMORPG, which ran on AOL from 1991 to 1997. &quot;NWN&quot; was a multi-player implementation of the Gold Box engine, and was the most popular features on AOL&#x27;s service, raising between US$5 million and US$7 million annually to the company from 1992 to 1997. It paved the way for later hits such as &quot;Ultima Online&quot; (1997) and &quot;EverQuest&quot; (1999).

===Closure and legacy===
When SSI and TSR announced in 1994 that the latter would not renew the former&#x27;s &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; license, the two companies described the end of the relationship as amicable. A SSI spokesperson said that the company disliked the license&#x27;s restrictions. With the Gold Box engine&#x27;s sales finally fading after a six-year run, the losses SSI absorbed during those two years of delays played a critical role in the sale of SSI to Mindscape in 1994.

Although the interest in the series eventually waned, the mantle of this genre was later assumed by more recent role-playing games such as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;.

==Features==
===Interface===
The &quot;Gold Box Engine&quot; has two main game play modes. Outside of character creation, game play takes place on a screen that displays text interactions, the names and current status of your party of characters, and a window which displays images of geography, pictures of characters or events. When combat occurs, the screen changes to a top-down mode resembling the one found in &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown&quot;, in which player character icons can move about to cast spells or attack icons representing the enemies. All the games typically involve long dungeon crawls, and are heavier on combat than on role-playing.

The Gold Box games form a number of series in which you can move characters who finish one game to the next one in the series. In addition, characters from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; can be imported into &quot;Hillsfar&quot;, a game based on an entirely different engine, and then exported into &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;. The system was improved over time, adding better colors, graphics, more player-class levels, new story lines, and real-time multiplayer gameplay.

===Platforms===
Games were released for the Amiga, Apple II, Mac, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, PC-98, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Genesis.

===Languages===
The C64 and Apple II versions were written completely in 6502 assembly, and were extremely advanced for the time, since those computers had around 64 KB of RAM. Most of the later ports and releases were written in Pascal. The latest official releases, &quot;Pirates of Realmspace&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Adventures&quot; are C/C++ based.

==Developers and ports==
Although the engine creation and most of the games were initially developed by SSI, there were many official ports and titles from other companies. Westwood Associates was in charge of some ports for the Amiga, which added mouse support and improved the graphics well before SSI&#x27;s own MS-DOS versions going to VGA display mode. MicroMagic made the only port of the series for the Atari ST home computer, &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;; following this, they developed &quot;The Dark Queen of Krynn&quot; and the &quot;Unlimited Adventures&quot; for SSI. Stormfront Studios did all the development for the &quot;Savage Frontier&quot; series and also the remarkable &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. Also mentionable, Cybertech was responsible for the development of &quot;Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace&quot;. For video game consoles, there were only two ports: &quot;Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday&quot; for the Sega Genesis and &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; for the Famicom/NES (from the Japanese company Marionette).

==Reception==
With 264,536 copies sold for computers in North America, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; became by far the most-successful game in SSI&#x27;s history, outselling &quot;Ultima V&quot; and &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale III&quot;. It was given a score of 90% by &quot;Commodore User&quot;. The reviewer Tony Dillon was impressed with the features.

The next game in the series, &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;, was also well received. It was given a score of 90% by magazine &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, and 89% on &quot;CU Amiga-64&quot;. Dave Arneson, one of the creators of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, expressed his disappointment that the Gold Box games did not innovate enough from previous CRPGs, comparing them to &quot;a cross ... between &quot;Questron&quot; and &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown&quot; presented in a new setting&quot;.

The final Gold Box game, &quot;The Dark Queen of Krynn&quot; (1992), sold 40,640 copies. SSI had sold over &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; products by 1992, and more than two million &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;-licensed games when it announced the end of the TSR license in 1994.

==On modern systems==
The games run well in DOSBox on modern operating systems. Also the Gold Box Companion has been developed to smooth out some of the rough edges in the programming of some of the games. Some of the early games, for instance, do not allow turning off Quick Fight, which sets characters to automatic in combat. The Gold Box Companion was included in the 2022 Steam release of the Gold Box games.

GOG.com released the &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; and &quot;Savage Frontier&quot; Gold Box series digitally on August 20, 2015, as a part of &quot;Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Two&quot;. Later on October 27, they released the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series as part of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Krynn Series&quot;.

SNEG released the Gold Box Classics digitally through Steam on March 9, 2022.

<text>Genaro Anthony Sirico Jr. (; July 24, 1942 – July 8, 2022) was an American actor who portrayed Paulie Gualtieri in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

Born in Brooklyn to an Italian-American family, Sirico had a tumultuous early life marked by multiple arrests and periods of imprisonment for crimes including robbery, assault, and extortion. His interest in acting was sparked during a prison sentence, following a visit by an acting troupe of ex-convicts. Sirico&#x27;s acting career began with minor roles in films such as &quot;Crazy Joe&quot; and eventually led to significant roles in movies including &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;, as well as appearances in six other Woody Allen films.

Aside from his film career, Sirico made notable contributions to television and animation, voicing characters in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. His role in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; earned him acclaim. Sirico&#x27;s life off-screen was marked by his service in the United States Army, and his philanthropic efforts, including USO visits to Southwest Asia. He died in 2022, aged 79.

==Early life==
Sirico was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on July 24, 1942, to a family of Italian descent. He grew up in the East Flatbush and Bensonhurst neighborhoods of Brooklyn, and attended Midwood High School, but did not graduate. Sirico&#x27;s brother, Robert Sirico, is a Catholic priest and co-founder of the free-market Acton Institute. As a teenager, Sirico was shot in a dispute over a girl. He subsequently served in the United States Army.

Sirico was convicted of several crimes and was arrested 28 times, including for disorderly conduct, assault, and robbery, before taking up acting. In 1967, he served time in prison for the first time as an adult. On February 27, 1970, he was arrested at a restaurant, and found with a .32 caliber revolver on his person. In 1971, he was indicted for extortion, coercion, and felony weapons possession, convicted, and sentenced to four years in prison, of which he served 20 months at Sing Sing. 

According to a court transcript at the time of his sentencing, Sirico also had pending charges for criminal possession of a dangerous drug. Sirico stated that his prison was visited by an acting troupe composed of ex-convicts, which inspired him to give acting a try. He appeared in the 1989 documentary &quot;The Big Bang&quot; by James Toback, in which he discussed his earlier life.

==Career==

Sirico&#x27;s first confirmed role in film was as an extra in the 1974 film &quot;Crazy Joe&quot;, securing the role with the help of Richard Castellano. Michael Gazzo was Sirico&#x27;s first acting coach. Sirico played gangsters in a number of films, and made-for-TV films, including &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Mob Queen&quot;, &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;, &quot;Love and Money&quot;, &quot;Fingers&quot;, &quot;The One Man Jury&quot;, &quot;Defiance&quot;, &quot;The Last Fight&quot;, &quot;Innocent Blood&quot;, &quot;Bullets over Broadway&quot;, &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot;, &quot;Gotti&quot;, &quot;Witness to the Mob&quot;, &quot;The Search for One-eye Jimmy&quot;, &quot;Cop Land&quot;, &quot;Turn of Faith&quot;, &quot;Hello Again&quot;, &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Wheel&quot;. He also played policemen in the films &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; and &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;. Sirico was a close friend of Woody Allen, and appeared in seven of his films.

Sirico&#x27;s most acclaimed acting job was that of Paulie Gualtieri in David Chase&#x27;s Emmy award-winning drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He originally auditioned for the role of Uncle Junior with Frank Vincent, but Dominic Chianese landed the role. David Chase instead offered him the role of Paulie Gualtieri; Sirico agreed under the condition that his character &quot;would not become a rat&quot;.
In animation, Sirico provided the voice of &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Fairywinkle in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. On &quot;Family Guy&quot;, he voiced the character of Vinny, who for three episodes in late 2013 was the family&#x27;s pet dog, replacing Brian Griffin after his death; Brian would later be brought back via time travel. Sirico also made a live-action cameo in the episode &quot;Stewie, Chris, &amp; Brian&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, where he threatens Stewie, who had insulted Italians, calling them &quot;ridiculous people&quot;. Vinny would return in a cameo appearance at the end of the Season 15 premiere, &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;. Sirico would later voice characters on Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s other animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;.

In 2018, he reunited with former &quot;Sopranos&quot; actors Federico Castelluccio and Vincent Pastore in &quot;Sarah Q&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sirico had two children, Joanne and Richard. 
In 2008, he released a cologne called Paolo Per Uomo.

Sirico died on the afternoon of July 8, 2022, at an assisted living facility in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at the age of 79. No cause of death was given, but he had been diagnosed with dementia some years before his death. Sirico&#x27;s funeral mass was held at the Basilica of Regina Pacis, and he was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

<doc id="524493" wikidata="Q5472344" url="?curid=524493" title="Fort William Historical Park">
<text>Fort William Historical Park (formerly known as Old Fort William) is a Canadian historical site located in Thunder Bay, Ontario, that contains a reconstruction of the Fort William fur trade post as it existed in 1815. It officially opened on July 3, 1973.

The site is located on the banks of the Kaministiquia River at Point de Meuron. This point is a few kilometres upstream from the original fort&#x27;s site, Fort Kaministiquia, which has been built over as part of the city of Thunder Bay. Point de Meuron has separate historical significance, as it was the location of an Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post of the same name.

==History==
The North West Company had a major depot at Grand Portage to the west of Fort William. After the American Revolutionary War, Britain finally ceded the area to the United States (US) under the Jay Treaty of 1796, to settle the northern border. British/Canadian fur traders wanted to create a new center of operations to avoid US taxes, and so the trading post was moved north to what became Fort William on the Canadian side of the border.

Fort William Historical Park is known as a living history site. Numerous historic buildings have been reconstructed to show the range of the post, and costumed historical interpreters recreate Fort William of the year 1816. Fort William was then not primarily a settlement, but a central transport depot within the now-defunct North West Company&#x27;s network of fur trade outposts. Due to its central role, Fort William was much larger, with more facilities than the average fur trade post. Reflecting this, Fort William Historical Park contains 42 reconstructed buildings, a reconstructed Ojibwa village, and a small farm.

Historical interpreters represent the many roles and cultures involved in the fur trade, including Scottish fur traders (people of capital), who often took Native American wives and had their families living with them; French Canadian voyageurs and workers, who also had wives from among the Natives; and native hunters and trappers. The native people in the Fort William area are predominantly Ojibwa and are represented accordingly among the interpreters.

The North West Company&#x27;s &quot;winter partners&quot;, fur traders who lived at the post, in the early years married into the upper classes of the native people, strengthening their alliances. There were thus two tiers of society - the fur traders and chiefs and their daughters, and the workers, who formed liaisons or married native women. The descendants of the latter tended to stay in fur trapping and became the Métis ethnic group. While also of mixed heritage, children of fur traders and chief&#x27;s daughters tended to receive thorough English educations (as well as learning Native culture from their mothers&#x27; families) and often moved within the upper classes of Canadian society, including being selected for government posts.

Fort William Historical Park has a working community of skilled tradesmen, including a blacksmith, tinsmith, carpenter, cooper, and birch bark canoe builder. They all craft products according to traditional early 19th-century methods and tools. Many of their crafts are not widely practised elsewhere. Fort William&#x27;s canoe builder has built birch bark canoes for other Canadian cultural sites, including the Canadian Museum of Civilization.

Each summer Fort William Historical Park hosts the &quot;Great Rendezvous&quot;, a recreation of the annual meeting of company fur traders that took place at this central location. Participants from all over Canada and the United States register to camp for the weekend at Fort William Historical Park and take part in this historical reenactment.

==Legacy==
On 28 June 1985 Canada Post issued &#x27;Fort William, Ont.&#x27; one of the 20 stamps in the “Forts Across Canada Series” (1983 &amp; 1985). The stamps are perforated x 13 mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.

== Location ==
The park is located at the south end of King Road, which runs off of Broadway Avenue two kilometres west of Highway 61. Thunder Bay Transit’s route 4 Neebing makes several trips that include Fort William Historical Park throughout the daytime on weekdays.

== Amphitheatre ==
In 2008 the fort built an amphitheatre to host a variety of events. It is one of Canada&#x27;s largest purpose-built outdoor entertainment venues. The Amphitheatre is designed to host events with audience sizes up to 50,000. It is configured to be capable of hosting multiple independent events at the same time. The Amphitheatre is a year-round venue, capable of featuring six regulation-size hockey ice surfaces in the winter, and a full-service campground during special events and concerts in the summer.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<doc id="524501" wikidata="Q1060343" url="?curid=524501" title="Independent set (graph theory)">
<text>In graph theory, an independent set, stable set, coclique or anticlique is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. That is, it is a set formula_1 of vertices such that for every two vertices in formula_1, there is no edge connecting the two. Equivalently, each edge in the graph has at most one endpoint in formula_1. A set is independent if and only if it is a clique in the graph&#x27;s complement. The size of an independent set is the number of vertices it contains. Independent sets have also been called &quot;internally stable sets&quot;, of which &quot;stable set&quot; is a shortening.

A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a proper subset of any other independent set.

A maximum independent set is an independent set of largest possible size for a given graph formula_4. This size is called the independence number of &quot;formula_4&quot; and is usually denoted by formula_6. The optimization problem of finding such a set is called the maximum independent set problem. It is a strongly NP-hard problem. As such, it is unlikely that there exists an efficient algorithm for finding a maximum independent set of a graph.

Every maximum independent set also is maximal, but the converse implication does not necessarily hold.

==Properties==

===Relationship to other graph parameters===

A set is independent if and only if it is a clique in the graph’s complement, so the two concepts are complementary. In fact, sufficiently large graphs with no large cliques have large independent sets, a theme that is explored in Ramsey theory.

A set is independent if and only if its complement is a vertex cover. Therefore, the sum of the size of the largest independent set formula_6 and the size of a minimum vertex cover formula_8 is equal to the number of vertices in the graph.

A vertex coloring of a graph formula_4 corresponds to a partition of its vertex set into independent subsets. Hence the minimal number of colors needed in a vertex coloring, the &quot;chromatic number&quot; formula_10, is at least the quotient of the number of vertices in formula_4 and the independent number formula_6.

In a bipartite graph with no isolated vertices, the number of vertices in a maximum independent set equals the number of edges in a minimum edge covering; this is Kőnig&#x27;s theorem.

===Maximal independent set===

An independent set that is not a proper subset of another independent set is called &quot;maximal&quot;. Such sets are dominating sets. Every graph contains at most 3&quot;n&quot;/3 maximal independent sets, but many graphs have far fewer.
The number of maximal independent sets in &quot;n&quot;-vertex cycle graphs is given by the Perrin numbers, and the number of maximal independent sets in &quot;n&quot;-vertex path graphs is given by the Padovan sequence. Therefore, both numbers are proportional to powers of 1.324718..., the plastic ratio.

==Finding independent sets==

In computer science, several computational problems related to independent sets have been studied.
*In the maximum independent set problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a maximum independent set in the graph. If there are multiple maximum independent sets, only one need be output. This problem is sometimes referred to as &quot;vertex packing&quot;.
*In the maximum-weight independent set problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices and the output is an independent set with maximum total weight. The maximum independent set problem is the special case in which all weights are one.
*In the maximal independent set listing problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a list of all its maximal independent sets. The maximum independent set problem may be solved using as a subroutine an algorithm for the maximal independent set listing problem, because the maximum independent set must be included among all the maximal independent sets.
*In the independent set decision problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number &quot;k&quot;, and the output is a Boolean value: true if the graph contains an independent set of size &quot;k&quot;, and false otherwise.
The first three of these problems are all important in practical applications; the independent set decision problem is not, but is necessary in order to apply the theory of NP-completeness to problems related to independent sets.

===Maximum independent sets and maximum cliques===

The independent set problem and the clique problem are complementary: a clique in &quot;G&quot; is an independent set in the complement graph of &quot;G&quot; and vice versa. Therefore, many computational results may be applied equally well to either problem. For example, the results related to the clique problem have the following corollaries:
* The independent set decision problem is NP-complete, and hence it is not believed that there is an efficient algorithm for solving it.
* The maximum independent set problem is NP-hard and it is also hard to approximate.

Despite the close relationship between maximum cliques and maximum independent sets in arbitrary graphs, the independent set and clique problems may be very different when restricted to special classes of graphs. For instance, for sparse graphs (graphs in which the number of edges is at most a constant times the number of vertices in any subgraph), the maximum clique has bounded size and may be found exactly in linear time; however, for the same classes of graphs, or even for the more restricted class of bounded degree graphs, finding the maximum independent set is MAXSNP-complete, implying that, for some constant &quot;c&quot; (depending on the degree) it is NP-hard to find an approximate solution that comes within a factor of &quot;c&quot; of the optimum.

=== Exact algorithms ===
The maximum independent set problem is NP-hard. However, it can be solved more efficiently than the O(&quot;n&quot;2 2&quot;n&quot;) time that would be given by a naive brute force algorithm that examines every vertex subset and checks whether it is an independent set.

As of 2017 it can be solved in time O(1.1996&quot;n&quot;) using polynomial space. When restricted to graphs with maximum degree 3, it can be solved in time O(1.0836&quot;n&quot;).

For many classes of graphs, a maximum weight independent set may be found in polynomial time. Famous examples are claw-free graphs, &quot;P&quot;5-free graphs and perfect graphs. For chordal graphs, a maximum weight independent set can be found in linear time.

Modular decomposition is a good tool for solving the maximum weight independent set problem; the linear time algorithm on cographs is the basic example for that. Another important tool are clique separators as described by Tarjan.

Kőnig&#x27;s theorem implies that in a bipartite graph the maximum independent set can be found in polynomial time using a bipartite matching algorithm.

=== Approximation algorithms ===
In general, the maximum independent set problem cannot be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time (unless P = NP). In fact, Max Independent Set in general is Poly-APX-complete, meaning it is as hard as any problem that can be approximated to a polynomial factor. However, there are efficient approximation algorithms for restricted classes of graphs.

==== In planar graphs ====
In planar graphs, the maximum independent set may be approximated to within any approximation ratio &quot;c&quot; &lt; 1 in polynomial time; similar polynomial-time approximation schemes exist in any family of graphs closed under taking minors.

==== In bounded degree graphs ====
In bounded degree graphs, effective approximation algorithms are known with approximation ratios that are constant for a fixed value of the maximum degree; for instance, a greedy algorithm that forms a maximal independent set by, at each step, choosing the minimum degree vertex in the graph and removing its neighbors, achieves an approximation ratio of (Δ+2)/3 on graphs with maximum degree Δ. Approximation hardness bounds for such instances were proven in . Indeed, even Max Independent Set on 3-regular 3-edge-colorable graphs is APX-complete.

==== In interval intersection graphs ====

An interval graph is a graph in which the nodes are 1-dimensional intervals (e.g. time intervals) and there is an edge between two intervals if and only if they intersect. An independent set in an interval graph is just a set of non-overlapping intervals. The problem of finding maximum independent sets in interval graphs has been studied, for example, in the context of job scheduling: given a set of jobs that has to be executed on a computer, find a maximum set of jobs that can be executed without interfering with each other. This problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time using earliest deadline first scheduling.

==== In geometric intersection graphs ====

A geometric intersection graph is a graph in which the nodes are geometric shapes and there is an edge between two shapes if and only if they intersect. An independent set in a geometric intersection graph is just a set of disjoint (non-overlapping) shapes. The problem of finding maximum independent sets in geometric intersection graphs has been studied, for example, in the context of Automatic label placement: given a set of locations in a map, find a maximum set of disjoint rectangular labels near these locations.

Finding a maximum independent set in intersection graphs is still NP-complete, but it is easier to approximate than the general maximum independent set problem. A recent survey can be found in the introduction of .

==== In d-claw-free graphs ====
A &quot;d-claw&quot; in a graph is a set of &quot;d&quot;+1 vertices, one of which (the &quot;center&quot;) is connected to the other &quot;d&quot; vertices, but the other d vertices are not connected to each other. A &quot;d&quot;-claw-free graph is a graph that does not have a &quot;d&quot;-claw subgraph. Consider the algorithm that starts with an empty set, and incrementally adds an arbitrary vertex to it as long as it is not adjacent to any existing vertex. In &quot;d&quot;-claw-free graphs, every added vertex invalidates at most &quot;d&quot;-1 vertices from the maximum independent set; therefore, this trivial algorithm attains a (&quot;d&quot;-1)-approximation algorithm for the maximum independent set. In fact, it is possible to get much better approximation ratios:

* Neuwohner presented a polynomial time algorithm that, for any constant ε&gt;0, finds a (&quot;d&quot;/2-1/63,700,992+ε)-approximation for the maximum weight independent set in a &quot;d&quot;-claw free graph.
* Cygan presented a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that, for any ε&gt;0, attains a (d+ε)/3 approximation.

===Finding maximal independent sets===

The problem of finding a maximal independent set can be solved in polynomial time by a trivial parallel greedy algorithm . All maximal independent sets can be found in time O(3&quot;n&quot;/3) = O(1.4423&quot;n&quot;).

=== Counting independent sets ===

The counting problem #IS asks, given an undirected graph, how many independent sets it contains. This problem is intractable, namely, it is ♯P-complete, already on graphs with maximal degree three. It is further known that, assuming that NP is different from RP, the problem cannot be tractably approximated in the sense that it does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme with randomization (FPRAS), even on graphs with maximal degree six; however it does have an fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) in the case where the maximal degree is five. The problem #BIS, of counting independent sets on bipartite graphs, is also ♯P-complete, already on graphs with maximal degree three.
It is not known whether #BIS admits a FPRAS.

The question of counting maximal independent sets has also been studied.

== Applications ==
The maximum independent set and its complement, the minimum vertex cover problem, is involved in proving the computational complexity of many theoretical problems. They also serve as useful models for real world optimization problems, for example maximum independent set is a useful model for discovering stable genetic components for designing engineered genetic systems.

<text>A box-office bomb is a film that is unprofitable or considered highly unsuccessful during its theatrical run. Although any film for which the combined production budget, marketing, and distribution costs exceed the revenue after release has technically &quot;bombed&quot;, the term is more frequently used for major studio releases that were highly anticipated, extensively marketed, and expensive to produce, but nevertheless failed commercially. Originally, a &quot;bomb&quot; had the opposite meaning, referring instead to a successful film that &quot;exploded&quot; at the box office. The term continued to be used this way in the United Kingdom into the 1970s.

== Causes ==
=== Negative word of mouth ===
With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter in the 2000s, word of mouth regarding new films is easily spread and has had a marked effect on box office performance. A film&#x27;s ability or failure to attract positive or negative commentary can strongly impact its performance at the box office, especially on the opening weekend.

=== External circumstances ===
Occasionally, films may underperform because of issues largely unrelated to the content of the film, such as the timing of the film&#x27;s release. This was one of the reasons given for the commercial failure of &quot;Intolerance&quot;, D. W. Griffith&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. Owing to production delays, the film was not released until late 1916, when the widespread antiwar sentiment it reflected had started to shift in favor of American entry into World War I. Another example is the 2015 docudrama about FIFA entitled &quot;United Passions&quot;. A glowing portrayal of FIFA, which had mostly funded the film, &quot;United Passions&quot; was released in theaters in the United States at the same time FIFA&#x27;s leaders were under investigation for fraud and corruption. The film grossed only $918 at the US box office in its opening weekend.

Sometimes, a film&#x27;s performance may be adversely affected by national crisis or a disaster, such as the September 11 attacks in 2001, Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021.

=== High production costs ===

In evaluating box-office gross numbers, it is important to keep in mind that not all money is returned to the film studio. Some of the gross is kept by the film exhibitors and the film distributor. The scratch formula for making a rough estimate of a studio&#x27;s portion of the gross is that the studio usually gets half.

A large budget can cause a film to fail financially, even when it performs reasonably well at the box office; 1980&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, for example, exceeded its planned production schedule by three months, causing its budget to inflate from US$12 million to US$44 million. The film only earned US$3.5 million at the box office.

For the 2005 film &quot;Sahara&quot;, its budget ballooned to US$281.2 million for production, distribution, and other expenses. The film earned US$119 million in theaters and US$202.9 million overall with television and other subsidies included, resulting in a net loss of US$78.3 million. In 2012, Disney reported losses of US$200 million on &quot;John Carter.&quot; The film had made a considerable US$234 million worldwide, but this was short of its $250 million budget plus worldwide advertising.

The 2007 film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; had a production budget of US$180 million. To be able to fund the film, New Line Cinema had to sell all of the film&#x27;s international distribution rights to various film distributors around the world. The film underperformed domestically, but was an international success; New Line Cinema did not have a cut of the international box office. These events were major factors in New Line Cinema becoming a division of Warner Bros. Pictures.

== Recovery ==
Films initially thought of as &quot;flops&quot; may recover income elsewhere. Several films have underperformed in their countries of origin, but have been sufficiently successful internationally to recoup losses or even become financial successes. Films may also recover money through international distribution, sales to television syndication, distribution outside of cinemas, and releases on home media. The 1995 post-apocalyptic action film &quot;Waterworld&quot; was the most expensive film ever made at the time after undergoing significant production difficulties. While it performed relatively well in the US box office, it did not initially turn a profit and became known as a box-office flop. International box-office takings and video sales led it to turn a profit. In 2023, &quot;&quot;, which underperformed at the box office, was given a COVID-19 insurance payout, which amounted to £57 million ($71 million).

Other films have succeeded long after cinema release by becoming cult films or being re-evaluated over time. High-profile films fitting this description include &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;Showgirls&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, and &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, each of which initially lost money at the box office but has since become popular.

== Studio failure ==
It is common for a single film&#x27;s lackluster performance to push its studio into the red, in the sense of recording a net loss on its income statement. In extreme cases, a bomb may push its studio into bankruptcy or closure. Examples of this include United Artists (&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;) and Carolco Pictures (&quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;). &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; was a success at the international box office and grossed $372 million worldwide; nonetheless, its underperformance at the box office in North America was seen as a significant factor in influencing the decision by Warner Bros. Pictures to take direct control of New Line Cinema.

In 2001, Square Pictures, a division of Square, released its only film, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;. It received mixed reviews from critics and failed to recover its $145 million cost. Following the film&#x27;s struggles, Square Pictures did not make any more films and is now a consolidated subsidiary of Square Enix as Visual Works. In 2011, &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot; was the last film released by ImageMovers Digital before Disney&#x27;s stake got absorbed by ImageMovers to a loss of nearly $140 million – the largest box-office bomb of all time in nominal dollar terms. Regardless of this loss, the decision to close the production company had been made a year prior to the film&#x27;s release.

== Independent films ==
The 2006 independent movie &quot;Zyzzyx Road&quot; made just $30 at the US box office. With a budget of $1.2 million and starring Tom Sizemore and Katherine Heigl, its tiny revenue is due to its limited box-office release – just six days in a single theater in Dallas for the purpose of meeting Screen Actors Guild requirements – rather than its ability to attract viewers. According to co-star Leo Grillo, it sold six tickets, two of which were to cast members.

Previously, the 2000 British film &quot;Offending Angels&quot; had become notorious for taking in less than £100 (~$150) at the box office. It had a £70,000 (~$105,000) budget but was panned by critics, including the BBC, who called it a &quot;truly awful pile of garbage&quot;, and &quot;Total Film&quot;, who called it &quot;irredeemable&quot;.

In 2011, the film &quot;The Worst Movie Ever!&quot; opened to just $11 at the US box office. It played in only one theater.

<text>A cuban prime is a prime number that is also a solution to one of two different specific equations involving differences between third powers of two integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

== First series ==
This is the first of these equations:

:formula_1

i.e. the difference between two successive cubes. The first few cuban primes from this equation are

:7, 19, 37, 61, 127, 271, 331, 397, 547, 631, 919, 1657, 1801, 1951, 2269, 2437, 2791, 3169, 3571, 4219, 4447, 5167, 5419, 6211, 7057, 7351, 8269, 9241, 10267, 11719, 12097, 13267, 13669, 16651, 19441, 19927, 22447, 23497, 24571, 25117, 26227 

The formula for a general cuban prime of this kind can be simplified to formula_2. This is exactly the general form of a centered hexagonal number; that is, all of these cuban primes are centered hexagonal. 

 the largest known has 3,153,105 digits with formula_3, found by R.Propper and S.Batalov.

== Second series ==
The second of these equations is:

:formula_4 

which simplifies to formula_5. With a substitution formula_6 it can also be written as formula_7.

The first few cuban primes of this form are:

:13, 109, 193, 433, 769, 1201, 1453, 2029, 3469, 3889, 4801, 10093, 12289, 13873, 18253, 20173, 21169, 22189, 28813, 37633, 43201, 47629, 60493, 63949, 65713, 69313 

The name &quot;cuban prime&quot; has to do with the role cubes (third powers) play in the equations.

<text>Dominic Chianese (; ; born February 24, 1931) is an American actor, singer, and musician. He is best known for his roles as Junior Soprano on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999–2007), Johnny Ola in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), and Leander Whitlock in &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; (2011–2013).

==Early life==
Chianese was born in the Bronx borough of New York City on February 24, 1931. His father was a bricklayer. His paternal grandfather was Italian and left Afragola for New York in 1904. Chianese graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1948. He first attended Champlain College in Plattsburgh, New York, but the university was closed due to the start of the Korean War. He later graduated from Brooklyn College in 1961 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in speech and theater.

==Career==
After a decade of attending college and appearing in off-Broadway theatre, Chianese attended his first professional acting class at HB Studio in Manhattan with renowned teacher Walt Witcover. His first Broadway show was &quot;Oliver!&quot; in 1965. He has continued to perform on Broadway, off Broadway, and in regional theatre. To supplement income during the periods where he struggled to find roles, he played rhythm guitar and sang in taverns and restaurants while hosting open mic nights at Gerdes Folk City in Greenwich Village.

Chianese&#x27;s first television role came when George C. Scott recommended him for the series &quot;East Side/West Side.&quot; In 1974, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola cast him as Johnny Ola in &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; beginning a film career that would see him appear several times alongside Al Pacino in films such as &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; (1979), and &quot;Looking for Richard&quot; (1996). He also co-starred with Pacino onstage. Before being cast in &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; he worked for the Drug Commission of New York as a recreational worker in rehab, where he gave guitar lessons to women who were serving time for drug crimes.

In terms of singing, Chianese is a tenor. He released an album titled &quot;Hits&quot; in 2000, featuring him singing American and Italian songs. He performed Salvatore Cardillo&#x27;s sentimental classic &quot;Core &#x27;ngrato&quot; (&quot;Ungrateful Heart&quot;) on the third season finale of &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; &quot;Army of One.&quot; In 2003, along with AOL Music, he released a second album titled &quot;Ungrateful Heart,&quot; which features 16 classic Neapolitan songs. In the 2000s, he played in a mandolin quartet every week at the Hotel Edison.

Chianese&#x27;s most prominent acting role was as Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano in the HBO hit show The Sopranos where he played a central role in the DiMeo Crime Family. Chianese was nominated for 2 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in the year 2000 and 2001.

Chianese appeared as a guest actor on the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; for three seasons as Leander Whitlock, a retired lawyer and power broker. In December 2018, he and co-author Matthew Sargent published his biography &quot;Twelve Angels: The Women Who Taught Me How to Act, Live, and Love.&quot;

His most recent film is &quot;Breathe Truth&quot; (2024), a short comedy directed by Thomas Vallely, screenplay by Rebecca Scarpati, about an elderly actor auditioning to play Shakespeare for the first time.

==Personal life==
In 2010, Chianese received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of his humanitarian efforts.

<doc id="524510" wikidata="Q1305608" url="?curid=524510" title="Leslie Bricusse">
<text>Leslie Bricusse OBE (; 29 January 1931 – 19 October 2021) was a British composer, lyricist, and playwright who worked on theatre musicals and wrote theme music for films. He was best known for writing the music and lyrics for the films &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;; &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;; &quot;Scrooge&quot;; &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;; &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;; the titular James Bond film songs &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;; &quot;Can You Read My Mind? (Love Theme from &quot;Superman&quot;)&quot; (with John Williams) from &quot;Superman&quot;; and &quot;Le Jazz Hot!&quot; (with Henry Mancini) from &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bricusse was born in Southfields, London on 29 January 1931, the son of Annie Mary (&quot;née&quot; Mills) and Cedric Bricusse, who already had a daughter. His paternal grandfather was Belgian, whilst his mother&#x27;s father came from Belfast in Northern Ireland. His father was employed by Kelmsley Newspapers for most of his working life. When Bricusse was two years old, his parents relocated to Pinner, Middlesex, and he was educated at University College School, Hampstead.

After completing a two-year period of National Service with the Royal Army Service Corps, he studied Modern and Medieval Languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was secretary of Footlights in 1952–53, and president the following year. He also formed the Cambridge University Musical Comedy Club, and wrote the lyrics for its first production, &quot;Lady at the Wheel&quot;, in 1953. It was during his college drama career that Bricusse began working for Beatrice Lillie. After later starring in her stage show &quot;An Evening with Beatrice Lillie&quot; for a year, he decided to concentrate on writing rather than performing.

==Career==
In the 1960s and 1970s, Bricusse enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Anthony Newley. They wrote the musical &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot; (1961), which was the basis of a 1966 film version and featured the Grammy-winning Song of the Year “What Kind of Fool Am I?” Also in collaboration with Newley, Bricusse wrote the show &quot;The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd&quot; (1965) and music for the film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), based on the children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; by Roald Dahl. For the latter, they received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song Score. When he collaborated with Newley, the two men referred to themselves as &quot;Brickman and Newburg&quot; – nicknames which arose after an unsuccessful attempt to create a musical based on Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film comedy &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;. &quot;Newburg&quot; concentrated mainly on the music and &quot;Brickman&quot; on the lyrics, whilst Ian Fraser often did their arrangements.

Working solely as a lyricist, he collaborated with composer Cyril Ornadel on &quot;Pickwick&quot; (1963), based on Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, a successful vehicle for Harry Secombe. His later collaborators included Henry Mancini (&quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; in 1992) and John Williams (&quot;Home Alone&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Hook&quot; in 1991).

Bricusse composed the music and lyrics for the songs in the 1967 film &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, which co-starred Newley, and also wrote its screenplay. Although the movie flopped at the box-office, &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot; earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He also scored the film &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969).

Sammy Davis Jr. had hits with two songs by Bricusse, &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I?&quot; (1962), from &quot;Stop the World - I Want to Get Off&quot;, and &quot;The Candy Man&quot; (1972), from &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In the United States, the latter release topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart for three weeks, and was the singer&#x27;s biggest hit.

Other recording artists who recorded successful versions of his songs include Nina Simone (&quot;Feeling Good&quot;), Matt Monro and Frank Sinatra (&quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;), Shirley Bassey (&quot;Goldfinger&quot;), Harry Secombe (&quot;If I Ruled the World&quot;), Nancy Sinatra (&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;), The Turtles (&quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot;), Maureen McGovern (&quot;Can You Read My Mind&quot;), and Diana Krall (&quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot;).

Bricusse partnered with George Tipton to write the opening theme of the American television sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;.

&quot;Pure Imagination: The World of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse&quot;, devised and directed by Bruce Kimmel, opened at the Pacific Resident Theatre in Venice, California, on 7 December 2013. In 2015, it went to the St James Theatre, London.

Bricusse was inducuted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989. On 29 October 2001, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for &quot;services to the film industry and the theatre&quot; from Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony.

In 2015, he released a memoir entitled &quot;Pure Imagination: A Sorta-Biography&quot;, with a foreword by Elton John.

==Personal life==
Bricusse lived in California and in London, in an apartment overlooking the River Thames. He married actress Yvonne &quot;Evie&quot; Romain on 18 October 1958 at St James&#x27;s Church, Marylebone. The couple&#x27;s son, Adam Cedric (born 4 April 1964), pursued a career as an artist after studying fine art at Merton College, Oxford.

==Death==
Bricusse died in his sleep in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, on 19 October 2021, aged 90. In 2024, his wife donated his papers, including 225 notebooks, to the Library of Congress.

<text>A lunch box (or lunchbox) is a hand-held container used to transport food, usually to work or to school. It is commonly made of metal or plastic, is reasonably airtight and often has a handle for carrying.
==In the United States==
In the United States a lunchbox may also be termed a lunch pail, lunch bucket, or lunch tin, either as one or two words.

The concept of a food container has existed for a long time, but it was not until people began using tobacco tins to carry meals in the early 20th century, followed by the use of lithographed images on metal, that the containers became a staple of youth, and a marketable product. It has most often been used by schoolchildren to take packed lunches, or a snack, from home to school. The most common modern form is a small case with a clasp and handle, often printed with a colorful image that can either be generic or based on children&#x27;s television shows or films. Use of lithographed metal to produce lunch boxes from the 1950s through the 1980s gave way to injection-molded plastic in the 1990s.

A lunch kit comprises the actual &quot;box&quot; and a matching vacuum bottle. However, popular culture has more often embraced the singular term lunch box, which is now most commonly used.

With increasing industrialization resulting in Americans working outside the home in factories, it became unfeasible to go home to lunch every day, thus it was necessary to have something to protect and transport a meal. Since the 19th century, American industrial workers have used sturdy containers to hold hardy lunches, consisting of foods such as hard-boiled eggs, vegetables, meat, coffee, and pie. David Shayt, curator of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, states that &quot;Some of our earliest examples, from the 19th century, were woven baskets with handles. A meal would be wrapped in a handkerchief. Depending on your station, a fancy wooden box would be used by the wealthy.&quot; Tinplate boxes and recycled biscuit tins commonly were used in the early 1800s, and fitted metal pails and boxes began to appear around the 1850s. Patents started to appear for lunchbox inventions in the 1860s.

Vacuum bottles, which enabled hot or cold beverages to remain at optimal temperature until lunchtime, became a common component of the lunch box. In 1920, The American Thermos Bottle Co. produced &quot;the first metal lunch box for kids&quot; to aid selling their vacuum bottles.

===Decorated===
The first lunch box decorated with a famous licensed character was introduced in 1935. Produced by Geuder, Paeschke &amp; Frey, it featured Mickey Mouse, and was a four-color lithographed oval tin, with a pull-out tray inside. It had no vacuum bottle, but did have a handle.

In 1950, Aladdin Industries created the first children&#x27;s lunch box based on a television show, &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;. The Hopalong Cassidy lunch kit, or &quot;Hoppy&quot;, quickly became Aladdin&#x27;s cash cow. Debuting in time for back-to-school 1950, it would go on to sell 600,000 units in its first year alone, each at 2.39. In 1953, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were featured on models introduced by American Thermos.

Over 450 decorated models quickly followed, and more than 120 million metal lunch boxes were sold between 1950 and 1970, often accompanied by a Thermos, initially made of metal and glass, and later plastic.

Lunch boxes have been manufactured using various materials. Typically, children&#x27;s school lunch boxes are made of plastic or vinyl, while adult workers&#x27; lunch boxes are commonly made of metal, such as tin or aluminium, due to the greater need for durability. The aluminium variant was invented in 1954 by Leo May, a miner in Sudbury, Ontario, after he accidentally crushed his tin lunch box.

Manufacturers grew to include ADCO Liberty, Kruger Manufacturing Company, Landers, Frary and Clark (Universal), Okay Industries, and a number of other producers through the 1980s.

The first use of plastics was the lunch box handle, but later spread to the entire box, with the first molded plastic boxes produced during the 1960s. Vinyl lunch boxes debuted in 1959.

During the 1960s, the lunch box had few changes. The vacuum bottle included in them, however, steadily evolved during the course of the decade and into the 1970s. What was originally a steel vacuum bottle with glass liner, cork or rubber stopper, and bakelite cup became an all-plastic bottle, with insulated foam rather than vacuum. Aladdin produced glass liners into the 1970s, but they were soon replaced with plastic.

===School safety===
Beginning in Florida during the 1970s, with the lobbying of parents who claimed the metal boxes were being used as weapons in fights, many schools in the United States banned metal lunch boxes. One of the last metal lunchboxes to be widely produced was one with a design promoting &quot;&quot;.

===Health issues===
Health concerns came to light in August 2002, when the Center for Environmental Health discovered that many popular vinyl lunch boxes contained dangerous levels of lead. Although not all were removed, many were pulled from the shelves.

In 2001, most major manufacturers began testing their lunch boxes for lead levels, remedying the issue, and labeling their boxes as lead-free.

===Modern lunch boxes===
Today, lunch boxes are generally made of plastic with foam insulation and an aluminium/vinyl interior. As a result, they usually retain temperature better but are less rigid and protective. However, metal lunch boxes are still produced, though they are not as popular as they were in the 1960s through 1980s.

===Collecting===
Some lunch boxes, including those from the 1950s and 1960s, sometimes sell into the thousands of dollars. In 1999, a &quot;1954 Superman lunch box, made by Adco Liberty&quot; was &quot;gaveled down for $11,500&quot; (&quot;the highest auction price ever paid for a lunch box&quot;).

===Political symbolism===
In the United States, the lunch box or lunch pail has been used as a symbol of the working class. The phrase &quot;lunch pail Democrat&quot; is used to classify populist politicians who attempt to gain the votes of the working class. &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed in 2008 that Joe Biden is a lunch-bucket Democrat. While his father had been wealthy early in life, by the time Biden was born, the family was broke.

==Outside the United States==


Japan has a tradition of &quot;bento&quot;, individual portable meals, that dates back several centuries and influenced other countries in South East Asia. Bento generally consists of rice and a number of other food items, transported within a lunchbox that has compartments to keep each item separate.

In Mumbai, India, there are extensive lunchbox delivery services, continuing a business model that originated in 1890, where delivery staff called &quot;dabawallas&quot; pick up metal tiffin carrier lunchboxes containing freshly cooked food, usually from the recipient&#x27;s home, deliver them to people at their place of work and return empty lunchboxes.

In Korea, the similar concept is known as dosirak.

In some South American countries, a lunch box is called &quot;lonchera&quot;, especially among school children, in assimilation of the English word &quot;lunch&quot;.

<doc id="524525" wikidata="Q3454399" url="?curid=524525" title="Réal Caouette">
<text>David Réal Caouette (; September 26, 1917 – December 16, 1976) was a Canadian politician from Quebec. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) and leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada and founder of the &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot;. Outside politics he worked as a car dealer.

His son, Gilles Caouette, was also a Social Credit MP and was briefly acting leader of the party.

==Early political career==
Caouette was born in Amos, in the Abitibi region of Quebec, the son of Marie (Cloutier) and Samuel Caouette. Caouette was converted to the social credit philosophy in 1939.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1946 by-election in Pontiac for the &quot;Union des électeurs&quot;, a pro-Social Credit group in Quebec. He sat as a Social Credit MP once elected. In the 1949 election, his home was drawn into the newly created Villeneuve, and he was defeated as a &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; candidate.

==Out of Parliament==
He ran again in the 1953, 1957 and 1958 elections, but was unsuccessful each time. He also ran provincially, for the Quebec Liberal Party, in the 1956 provincial election but was defeated. In 1958, he broke with &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; founders Louis Even and Gilberte Côté-Mercier, and joined Social Credit forming &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot; as the national party&#x27;s Quebec wing of which he became the uncontested leader.

==Leadership defeat==
In 1961, he ran for leadership of the Social Credit Party, which had no federal representation at the time following the 1958 election, but lost to the party&#x27;s president, Robert N. Thompson of Alberta. The totals were never released.

Caouette later claimed that on paper, he would have had enough support to win but for Alberta Premier Ernest Manning&#x27;s intervention in favour of Thompson. According to Caouette, Manning told the Quebec delegates to vote for Thompson because Western Socreds would never accept a Francophone Catholic as party leader.

==Breakthrough==
In the 1962 election, Social Credit won 26 seats in Québec, led by Caouette, who returned as the member for Villeneuve. He held this seat until 1968, when he transferred to the newly created Témiscamingue, a riding he would hold for the rest of his life. The party won only four seats in the rest of Canada. Under the circumstances, Thompson, now the MP for Red Deer, was all but forced to name Caouette as the party&#x27;s deputy leader. Holding the balance of power in the House of Commons of Canada, Social Credit helped bring down the Progressive Conservative minority government of John Diefenbaker. However, in the 1963 election, Social Credit was reduced to 24 seats nationwide, all but four of which were in Quebec.

Caouette fought for bilingualism in the House of Commons, winning a symbolic victory when he got the Parliament&#x27;s restaurant to produce bilingual menus. In this, he anticipated the official bilingualism policy that Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s government would later enact.

The Socred MPs from Québec considered Caouette as their true leader. Over time, Caouette came to believe that since the party was most successful in Québec, he should be the leader of the party instead of Thompson. As well, Caouette and his followers remained true believers in the social credit monetary theories of C. H. Douglas while Thompson and the party&#x27;s two most powerful branches—in Alberta and British Columbia—had largely abandoned the theory. Thompson refused to step aside, prompting Caouette and virtually all of the Socred MPs from Quebec to split from the party in 1963 and establish the &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot; as a separate political party.

In the 1965 election, Caouette&#x27;s &quot;Ralliement&quot; won nine seats, while Social Credit led by Thompson won five seats. In the 1968 election, Caouette&#x27;s party won 14 seats while Social Credit won none.

The two parties were reunited under Caouette&#x27;s leadership for the 1972 election. The reunited Socreds won 15 seats in that election, all in Québec. It would never elect another MP from English Canada, though it continued to nominate candidates outside of Québec.

==Later political career==
In the 1974 federal election, the Social Credit Party machine in Québec was wracked by internal divisions. Caouette was suffering from a snowmobiling accident, and therefore the powerful voice that had carried Social Credit in prior elections was silenced. When he was able to speak, Caouette focussed his attacks on the Progressive Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, instead of the Liberal Party, which was Social Credit&#x27;s main competitor in Québec. Two weeks before the election was called, Caouette had informed the parliamentary caucus that he would resign as leader in the fall. Despite the party infighting, they managed 11 seats. Though this was one seat short of official status, the Speaker of the House of Commons agreed to recognize them as a party.

The decline of the party accelerated after Caouette resigned from the party leadership in 1976. Caouette had announced in 1975 that he would step down from the leadership within a year. He was hospitalized after a stroke on September 16, and died three months later.

After his death in 1976, Social Credit went into decline both in Québec and at the federal level. The party fell to only six seats under Fabien Roy in the 1979 election. It was shut out of Parliament altogether in 1980, never to return. The party eventually folded in 1993.

==Political views==
Caouette mixed Social Credit&#x27;s traditional social conservatism with ardent Québec nationalism. A populist leader and charismatic speaker, Caouette appealed to those who felt left out and pushed aside by financial institutions, traditional politicians, and what they perceived as elitist intellectuals.

Throughout the course of his career, Caouette was known for making controversial and intemperate statements. Shortly after World War II, Caouette claimed that his economic theories were the same as those of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government in Italy, and said that Mussolini and Adolf Hitler were his political heroes. During the October Crisis of 1970, he also claimed that leaders of the Marxist &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot;, which precipitated the October Crisis, should be shot by a firing squad. While such statements may have resonated with &quot;Créditiste&quot; supporters, they impaired the party&#x27;s popularity with the mainstream electorate.

:&quot;The disdain for outsiders always seemed to fit conveniently with the theory of conspiracy of the old parties. The Jews were another and equally convenient part of the Creditiste demonology and there was a continuing strain of anti-Semitism. After the 1962 triumph, Caouette revealed that his political heroes were Hitler and Mussolini. As late as a few years ago, his bookshelves contained &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; ... If non-Creditistes were horrified, the loyalists did not seem to care.&quot;—John Gray

<doc id="524526" wikidata="Q7733314" url="?curid=524526" title="The Family Jams">
<text>The Family Jams is an album featuring members of the Manson Family recorded in 1970, with all songs written by Charles Manson, and first released in 1997. Manson himself does not perform on the album; most of the male vocals are sung by Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan. Other members appearing on the album are Sandra Good, Catherine &quot;Gypsy&quot; Share, Catherine &quot;Cappy&quot; Gillies, Nancy &quot;Brenda&quot; Pitman, and Ruth Ann &quot;Ouisch&quot; Moorehouse.

The album was released in 1997 by both Transparency Records and Aoroa Records simultaneously. The first disc contains a remaster of the limited-release white vinyl record &quot;The Manson Family Sings the Songs of Charles Manson&quot;. The second disc contains previously unreleased material and alternate takes.

==Production==
The Manson Family gathered together in late 1969, including Bruce Davis (then wanted by the FBI), in the Spahn Ranch saloon, to record music for Robert Hendrickson&#x27;s &quot;Manson&quot; film. This was the beginning of the Family Jams, though the earliest tapes remained buried in a vault. Audio was recorded as the murder trial was ongoing, with the song &quot;Get on Home&quot; containing the eerie line referring to the killers carving crosses into their foreheads: &quot;When you see the children with x&#x27;s on their head, if you dare to look at them, soon you will be dead.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs written by Charles Manson.

<doc id="524534" wikidata="Q7699493" url="?curid=524534" title="Tenantry Column">
<text>The Tenantry Column is a monument to the south of Alnwick town centre, in Northumberland, England. It was erected in 1816 by the tenants of Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland in thanks for his reduction of their rents during the post-Napoleonic depression. It is a Doric column standing tall and surmounted by a lion en passant, the symbol of the Percy family. Four more lions stand on a platform at the base of the column. A muster roll of the Percy Tenantry Volunteers was sealed into the foundation. The structure was granted protection as a listed building in 1952 and since 1977 has been listed in the highest category, grade I.

== Description ==
The Doric column is tall and topped by the Percy Lion, symbol of the historic Percy family. The lion sits on top of a drum decorated with foliage and surmounted with an iron balcony. The lion&#x27;s tail, unusually, is horizontal and is said to point towards Scotland but the reason why is not known. The lion, depicted en passant, points south.

The base of the column is surrounded by a circular granite platform of circumference, accessible by stairs. The platform is surrounded by four more lions, on black marble plinths, which look upon Alnwick. A panel on the west side of the base of the column is engraved &quot;To Hugh, Duke of Northumberland K.G This column is Erected, Dedicated and Inscribed By a Grateful and United Tenantry Anno Domini MDCCCXVI&quot;. Panels on two other sides are marked with the Percy family motto &quot;Esperance en dieu&quot; (French: Hope is in God). The fourth side contains the entrance to the column&#x27;s internal stair case. The platform was originally surrounded by railings, but these have been lost.

Buried in a cavity in the foundations is the regimental roll of the late Percy Tenantry Volunteers, written on vellum and sealed in a glass tube. In 1887 Alnwick&#x27;s railway station was built near to the column. It is one of the first sights to greet visitors to Alnwick, arriving from the south.

== History ==
Designed by the Newcastle architect David Stephenson, the column was erected by the tenants of the second Duke of Northumberland in 1816 in thanks for a reduction in rents. The foundation stone for the column was laid on 1 July 1816, an event witnessed by a large audience. The ceremony was led by a band and flag bearers and attended by Stephenson (bearing a ceremonial silver trowel), the principal tenants and two clergymen. The 21 oldest of Percy&#x27;s tenants ceremoniously used the trowel to lay the stone. The foundation stone was afterwards blessed and ceremonially doused with corn, wine and oil. The column was not completed until after the Duke&#x27;s 10 July 1817 death and was instead presented to his son Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland. The stone for the column came from a nearby estate on Percy family land.

The Duke had doubled or tripled rents during the agricultural boom that accompanied the Napoleonic Wars but, in an unusual show of 19th-century aristocratic generosity, had agreed to reduce them during the post-Napoleonic depression. The reduction applied is said to have been 25%. Percy was one of the richest men in England at this time. A local legend, proved to be false, is that upon seeing that his tenants had money to pay for the structure the Duke raised his rents once more. The Percy Tenantry Volunteers was a 1,500-strong unit of the British Volunteer Corps that the Duke had raised, at his own expense, during the war to defend the north-east from a potential French invasion.

The column is also known as &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Folly&quot;. It was granted protection as a listed building by Historic England on 20 February 1952: the listing was upgraded to the highest category, grade I, on 25 August 1977.

<doc id="524544" wikidata="Q635253" url="?curid=524544" title="Province of Posen">
<text>The Province of Posen (; ) was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1848 to 1920, occupying most of the historical Greater Poland. The province was established following the Poznań Uprising of 1848 as a successor to the Grand Duchy of Posen, which in turn was annexed by Prussia in 1815 from Duchy of Warsaw. It became part of the German Empire in 1871. After World War I, Posen was briefly part of the Free State of Prussia within Weimar Germany, but was dissolved in 1920 when the Greater Poland Uprising broke out and most of its territory was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic. The remaining German territory was re-organized into Posen-West Prussia in 1922.

Posen (present-day Poznań, Poland) was the provincial capital.

== Geography ==

The land is mostly flat, drained by two major watershed systems; the Noteć (German: &quot;Netze&quot;) in the north and the Warta (&quot;Warthe&quot;) in the center. Ice Age glaciers left moraine deposits and the land is speckled with hundreds of &quot;finger lakes&quot;, streams flowing in and out on their way to one of the two rivers.

Agriculture was the primary industry. The three-field system was used to grow a variety of crops, primarily rye, sugar beet, potatoes, other grains, and some tobacco and hops. Significant parcels of wooded land provided building materials and firewood. Small numbers of livestock existed, including geese, but a fair number of sheep were herded.

The area roughly corresponded to the historic region of Greater Poland. For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. When this area came under Prussian control, the feudal system was still in force. It was officially ended in Prussia (&quot;see&quot; Freiherr vom Stein) in 1810 (1864 in Congress Poland), but lingered in some practices until the late 19th century. The situation was thus that (primarily) Polish serfs lived and worked side by side with (predominantly) free German settlers. Though the settlers were given initial advantages, in time their lots were not much different. Serfs worked for the noble lord, who took care of them. Settlers worked for themselves and took care of themselves, but paid taxes to the lord.

Typically, an estate would have its manor and farm buildings, and a village nearby for the Polish laborers. Near that village, there might be a German settlement. And in the woods, there would be a forester&#x27;s dwelling. The estate owners, usually of the nobility, owned the local grist mill, and often other types of mills or perhaps a distillery. In many places, windmills dotted the landscape, reminding one of the earliest settlers, the Dutch, who began the process of turning unproductive river marshes into fields. This process was finished by the German settlers employed to reclaim unproductive lands (not only marshland) for the host estate owners.

== History ==
Greater Poland became Prussian in 1772 (Netze District) and 1793 (South Prussia) during the First and Second Partition of Poland. After Prussia&#x27;s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, the territory was attached to the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807 upon the Franco-Prussian Treaty of Tilsit. In 1815 during the Congress of Vienna, Prussia gained the western third of the Warsaw duchy, which was about half of former South Prussia. Prussia then administered this province as the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen, which lost most of its exceptional status already after the 1830 November Uprising in Congress Poland, as the Prussian authorities feared a Polish national movement which would have swept away the Holy Alliance system in Central Europe. Instead Prussian Germanisation measures increased under &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; Eduard Heinrich von Flottwell, who had replaced Duke-governor Antoni Radziwiłł.

A first Greater Poland Uprising in 1846 failed, as the leading insurgents around Karol Libelt and Ludwik Mierosławski were reported to the Prussian police and arrested for high treason. Their trial at the Berlin &quot;Kammergericht&quot; court gained them enormous popularity even among German national liberals, who themselves were suppressed by the Carlsbad Decrees. Both were released in the March Revolution of 1848 and triumphantly carried through the streets.

At the same time, a Polish national committee gathered at Poznań and demanded independence. The Prussian Army under General Friedrich August Peter von Colomb at first retired. King Frederick William IV of Prussia as well as the new Prussian commissioner, Karl Wilhelm von Willisen, promised a renewed autonomy status.

However, both among the German-speaking population of the province as well as in the Prussian capital, anti-Polish sentiments arose. While the local Posen (Poznań) Parliament voted 26 to 17 votes against joining German Confederation, on 3 April 1848 the Frankfurt Parliament ignored the vote, unsuccessfully attempting its status change to a common Prussian province, as well as its incorporation into the German Confederation. The Frankfurt parliamentarian Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Jordan vehemently spoke against Polish autonomy. The assembly at first attempted to divide the Posen duchy into two parts: the Province of Posen, which would have been given to the German population and annexed to a newly created Greater Germany, and the Province of Gniezno, which would have been given to the Poles and remain outside of Germany. Because of the protest of Polish politicians, this plan failed and the integrity of the duchy was preserved.

Nevertheless, when the Prussian troops had finally crushed the Greater Polish revolt, after a series of broken assurances, on 9 February 1849 the Prussian authorities renamed the duchy as the Province of Posen. In spite of that, the territory formally remained outside of the German Confederation (and thus Germany) until the German Confederation was dissolved and the North German Confederation was established, which occurred in 1866. Nevertheless, the Prussian Kings retained the title &quot;Grand Duke of Posen&quot; until the German and Prussian monarchy finally expired in 1918, following the abdication of William II.

With the unification of Germany after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the Province of Posen became part of the German Empire, and the city of Posen was officially named an imperial residence city. Bismarck&#x27;s hostility towards the Poles was already well known, as in 1861 he had written in a letter to his sister: &quot;Hit the Poles so hard that they despair of their life; I have full sympathy for their condition, but if we want to survive we can only exterminate them.&quot; His dislike was firmly entrenched in traditions of Prussian mentality and history. There was little need for discussions in Prussian circles, as most of them, including the monarch, agreed with his views. Poles suffered from discrimination by the Prussian state; numerous oppressive measures were implemented to eradicate the Polish community&#x27;s identity and culture.

The Polish inhabitants of Posen, who faced discrimination and even forced Germanization, favored the French side during the Franco-Prussian War. France and Napoleon III were known for their support and sympathy for the Poles under Prussian rule Demonstrations at news of Prussian-German victories manifested Polish independence feelings and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army, though these went mostly unheeded. Bismarck regarded these as an indication of a Slavic-Roman encirclement and even a threat to unified Germany. Under German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck renewed Germanisation policies began, including an increase of the police, a colonization commission, and the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;. The German Eastern Marches Society (&quot;Hakata&quot;) pressure group was founded in 1894 and in 1904, special legislation was passed against the Polish population. The legislation of 1908 allowed for the confiscation of Polish-owned property. The Prussian authorities did not permit the development of industries in Posen, so the duchy&#x27;s economy was dominated by high-level agriculture.

At the end of World War I, the fate of the province was undecided. The Polish inhabitants demanded the region be included in the newly independent Second Polish Republic, while the German minority refused any territorial concessions. Another Greater Poland Uprising broke out on 27 December 1918, a day after Ignacy Jan Paderewski&#x27;s speech. The uprising received little support from the Polish government in Warsaw. After the success of the uprising, Posen province was until mid-1919 an independent state with its own government, currency and military. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, most of the province, composed of the areas with a Polish majority, was ceded to Poland and was reformed as the Poznań Voivodeship. The majority-German populated remainder (with Bomst, Fraustadt, Neu Bentschen, Meseritz, Tirschtiegel (partially), Schwerin, Blesen, Schönlanke, Filehne, Schloppe, Deutsch Krone, Tütz, Schneidemühl, Flatow, Jastrow, and Krojanke—about ) was merged with the western remains of former West Prussia and was administered as Posen-West Prussia with Schneidemühl as its capital. This province was dissolved in 1938, when its territory was split between the neighboring Prussian provinces of Silesia, Pomerania and Brandenburg. In 1939, the territory of the former province of Posen was annexed by Nazi Germany and made part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Reichsgau Wartheland (initially &quot;Reichsgau Posen&quot;). By the time World War II ended in May 1945, it had been overrun by the Red Army.

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War in 1945, at Stalin&#x27;s demand all of the German territory east of the newly established Oder–Neisse line of the Potsdam Agreement was either turned over to the Poland or the Soviet Union. All historical parts of the province came under Polish control, and the remaining ethnic German population was expelled by force.

=== Dissolution after 1918 ===

==Religious and ethnic composition ==

This region was inhabited by a Polish majority, with German and Jewish minorities and a smattering of other ethnic groups. Almost all the Poles were Roman Catholic, and most of the Germans were Protestant. The small numbers of Jews were primarily in the larger communities, mostly in skilled crafts, local commerce and regional trading. The smaller a community, the more likely it was to be either all Polish or German. These &quot;pockets of ethnicity&quot; existed side by side, with German villages being the most dense in the northwestern areas. Under Prussia&#x27;s Germanization policies, the population became more German until the end of the 19th century, when the trend reversed (in the Ostflucht). This was despite efforts of the government in Berlin to prevent it, establishing the Settlement Commission to buy land from Poles and make it available for sale only to Germans.

The province&#x27;s large number of resident Germans resulted from constant immigration since the Middle Ages, when the first settlers arrived in the course of the Ostsiedlung. Although many of those had been Polonized over time, a continuous immigration resulted in maintaining a large German community. The 18th century Jesuit-led Counter-Reformation enacted severe restrictions on German Protestants. At the end of the 18th century when Prussia seized the area during the Partitions of Poland, thousands of German colonists were sent by Prussian officials to Germanize the area.

During the first half of the 19th century, the German population grew due to state sponsored colonisation. In the second half, the Polish population grew gradually due to the &quot;Ostflucht&quot; and a higher birthrate among the Poles. In the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, mainly Protestant Prussia sought to reduce the Catholic impact on its society. Posen was hit severely by these measures due to its large, mainly Polish Catholic population. Many Catholic Germans in Posen joined with ethnic Poles in opposition to anti-Catholic Kulturkampf measures. Following the Kulturkampf, the German Empire for nationalist reasons implemented Germanisation programs. One measure was to set up a Settlement Commission to attract German settlers to counter the Polish population&#x27;s higher growth. However, this failed, even when accompanied by additional legal measures. The Polish language was eventually banned from use in schools and government offices as part of the Germanisation policies.

There is a notable disparity between German statistics gathered by the Prussian administration, and the Polish estimates conducted after 1918. According to the Prussian census of 1905, the number of German speakers in the Province of Posen was approximately 38.5% (which included colonists, military stationed in the area and German administration), while after 1918 the number of Germans in the Poznan Voivodship, which closely corresponded to province of Posen, was only 7%. According to Witold Jakóbczyk, the disparity between the number of ethnic Germans and the number of German speakers is because Prussian authorities placed ethnic Germans and the German-speaking Jewish minority into the same class. Around 161,000 Germans in the province were officials, soldiers and their families settled in the region by German Empire. In addition, there was a considerable exodus of Germans from the Second Polish Republic after the latter was established. There was also Polonization of local Catholic Germans. Another reason of the disparity is that some border areas of the province, inhabited mostly by Germans (including Piła), remained in Germany after 1918. According to Polish authors, the real share of Poles in 1910 was 65% (rather than 61.5% claimed by official census).

==Divisions==

Prussian provinces were subdivided into government regions (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;), in Posen:
* Regierungsbezirk Posen 17,503 km2
* Regierungsbezirk Bromberg 11,448 km2
These regions were again subdivided into districts called &quot;Kreise&quot;. Cities would have their own &quot;Stadtkreis&quot; (urban district) and the surrounding rural area would be named for the city, but referred to as a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (rural district). In the case of Posen, the Landkreis was split into two: Landkreis Posen West, and Landkreis Posen East.

The German figure includes the German-speaking Jewish population.

<text>An ancestor, also known as a forefather, fore-elder, or a forebear, is a parent or (recursively) the parent of an antecedent (i.e., a grandparent, great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent and so forth). &quot;Ancestor&quot; is &quot;any person from whom one is descended. In law, the person from whom an estate has been inherited.&quot;

==Relationship==
Two individuals have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other or if they share a common ancestor. In evolutionary theory, species which share an evolutionary ancestor are said to be of common descent. However, this concept of ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of horizontal gene transfer. Some research suggests that the average person has twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. This might have been due to the past prevalence of polygynous relations and female hypergamy.

Assuming that all of an individual&#x27;s ancestors are otherwise unrelated to each other, that individual has 2&quot;n&quot; ancestors in the &quot;n&quot;th generation before them and a total of 2&quot;g&quot;+1 − 2 ancestors in the &quot;g&quot; generations before them. In practice, however, it is clear that most ancestors of humans (and any other species) are multiply related (see pedigree collapse). Consider &quot;n&quot; = 40: the human species is more than 40 generations old, yet the number 240, approximately 1012 or one trillion, dwarfs the number of humans who have ever lived.

Some cultures confer reverence to ancestors, both living and dead; in contrast, some more youth-oriented cultural contexts display less veneration of elders. In other cultural contexts, ancestor worship or, more accurately, ancestor veneration is when people seek providence from their deceased ancestors.

<doc id="524571" wikidata="Q288747" url="?curid=524571" title="Þórbergur Þórðarson">
<text>Þórbergur Þórðarson (&quot;Thórbergur Thórdarson&quot;) (Hali í Suðursveit, 12 March 1888/1889 – Reykjavík, 12 November 1974) was an Icelandic author and Esperantist.

An ironist, satirist, volatile critic, and ground-breaking achiever in experimental auto-fiction, Þórbergur arguably remains among Iceland&#x27;s most beloved 20th century authors. He is considered one of the greatest Icelandic stylists of his day, with an unrivalled vocabulary and astonishing facility for written expression. Therefore he was respectfully dubbed &quot;Maestro Þórbergur&quot;.

Þórbergur was an autodidact. As recounted in his largely autobiographical works, &quot;Íslenzkur aðall&quot; (1938) and &quot;Ofvitinn&quot; (1940), Þórbergur lived in poverty for much of his youth and early adulthood and could not afford secondary or higher education.

== Key years ==
1888-1906 Grew up in Suðursveit.

1906-1909 Worked as a ship&#x27;s cook.

1909-1913 Attended school without graduating.

1913-1918 Studied literature and philosophy at the University of Iceland but was not allowed to graduate.

1916 Began collecting Icelandic vocabulary.

1918 Delved into theosophy and yoga.

1918-1925 Worked as a teacher.

1924 His mistress gave birth to their daughter, Guðbjörg.

1925 Devotes his life to Esperanto.

1932 Married Margrét Jónsdóttir.

1921-1940 Travelled extensively in Europe.

1974 Received honorary doctorate from the University of Iceland.

Nov,12 1974 Died at Vífilsstaðir Hospital.

== The 1934 trial for offending Nazis ==

In January 1934, Þórbergur wrote a series of essays for the socialist daily &quot;Alþýðublaðið&quot;, titled &quot;The Nazis&#x27; Sadistic Appetite&quot; (&quot;Kvalaþorsti nazista&quot;). Iceland&#x27;s public prosecutor filed charges against Þórðarson for supposedly offensive clauses in the article, one of which labelled Adolf Hitler &quot;a sadist&quot;. The Supreme Court of Iceland agreed with the prosecutor and found the author guilty of &quot;derogating a foreign nation&quot;. The court sentenced Þórbergur to pay a fine of 200 krónur.

== English translations ==

The relatively little of Þórbergur&#x27;s work which has been translated into English consists mainly of fragments from his larger works. Portions of &quot;Íslenzkur aðall&quot; (1938) were published as &quot;In Search of My Beloved&quot; in 1967. In recent years, Professor Julian Meldon D&#x27;arcy has translated a fragment from &quot;Bréf til Láru&quot; (1924) as a short story, titled &quot;When I got pregnant&quot;, as well as the first full book to appear in English translation: &quot;The Stones Speak&quot; (2012), Þórbergur&#x27;s childhood memoirs, originally published as &quot;Steinarnir tala&quot; in 1956. Further translations are in progress.

<text>Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho Gaúcho () or simply Ronaldinho, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or left winger. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d&#x27;Or. He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a Ballon d&#x27;Or. A global icon of the sport, Ronaldinho was renowned for his dribbling abilities, free-kick accuracy, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes, and overhead kicks, as well as his ability to score and create goals. During his career he was one of the most valuable footballers in the world. He is known by the nickname &quot;O Bruxo&quot; (&#x27;The Wizard&#x27;).

Ronaldinho made his career debut for Grêmio, in 1998. Aged 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France, where he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup, before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title. The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, and another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double, receiving the 2005 Ballon d&#x27;Or, and his second FIFA World Player of the Year in the process. After scoring two solo goals in the first 2005–06 El Clásico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu. Due to these successes, Ronaldinho is widely credited with changing Barcelona&#x27;s history.

Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006–07 season and an injury-plagued 2007–08 season, Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances—due to a decrease in dedication and focus towards football—and departed Barcelona to join AC Milan, where he won the 2010–11 Serie A. He returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later where he won the 2013 Copa Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career: he was included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each, and was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for the 2005–06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013; in 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. In 2009, he was voted World Player of the Decade 2000s, ahead of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

In his international career with Brazil, Ronaldinho earned 97 caps, scored 33 goals, and represented them in two FIFA World Cups. After debuting with the &quot;Seleção&quot; by winning the 1999 Copa América, he was an integral player in the 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team, positioned alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. He captained his team to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup title and was named man of the match in the final. He also captained the Brazil Olympic team to a bronze medal in men&#x27;s football at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

== Early life ==

Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. His mother, Miguelina Elói Assis dos Santos, was a salesperson who studied to become a nurse. His father, João de Assis Moreira, was a shipyard worker and a footballer for the local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro (not to be confused with the larger Cruzeiro Esporte Clube). After Ronaldo&#x27;s elder brother Roberto signed with Grêmio, the family moved to a home in the more affluent Guarujá section of Porto Alegre, which was a gift from Grêmio to convince Roberto to stay at the club. Still, Roberto&#x27;s career was ultimately cut short by injury. When Ronaldo was eight years old, his father hit his head and drowned in the swimming pool at their new home. Roberto has acted as Ronaldo&#x27;s manager, while his sister Deisi has worked as his press coordinator.

Ronaldo&#x27;s football skills began to blossom at the age of eight, and he was first given the nickname &quot;Ronaldinho&quot;—&quot;inho&quot;, meaning &#x27;small&#x27;—because he was often the youngest and the smallest player in youth club matches. He developed an interest in futsal and beach football, which later expanded to organized football. Many of his signature moves originate from futsal, especially his ball control. His first brush with the media came at the age of 13, when he scored all 23 goals in a 23–0 victory against a local team. Ronaldinho was identified as a rising star at the 1997 U-17 World Championship in Egypt, in which he scored two goals on penalty kicks.

== Club career ==
=== Grêmio ===

Ronaldinho&#x27;s career began with the Grêmio youth squad. He made his senior side debut during the 1998 Copa Libertadores. 1999 saw the emergence of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho, with 22 goals in 47 matches, and he put in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional, most notably on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship final. In a match-winning performance, Ronaldinho embarrassed Internacional&#x27;s Brazilian legend and 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga, flicking the ball over his head on one occasion, and leaving him flat-footed in a mazy dribble on another. Ronaldinho achieved further success with Grêmio, winning the inaugural Copa Sul.

In 2001, Arsenal expressed interest in signing Ronaldinho, but the move collapsed after he could not obtain a work permit because he was a non-EU player who had not played enough international matches. He considered playing on loan with Scottish Premier League side St Mirren, which never happened due to his involvement in a fake passport scandal in Brazil.

=== Paris Saint-Germain ===

In 2001, Ronaldinho signed a five-year contract with French club Paris Saint-Germain in a €5 million transfer. Upon his arrival in Paris, Ronaldinho was given the number 21 shirt and inserted into a lineup that included fellow Brazilian Aloísio, midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha and striker Nicolas Anelka.

==== 2001–02 season ====
Ronaldinho made his league debut for the club on 4 August 2001, appearing as a substitute in a 1–1 draw with Auxerre. Ronaldinho spent the majority of the first few months of the 2001–02 season alternated between the bench and starter&#x27;s role. He scored his first goal for the club on 13 October in a 2–2 draw against Lyon, converting the equalizing penalty in the 79th minute after having come on ten minutes prior. After returning from the winter break, Ronaldinho went on a tear, scoring a goal in four consecutive matches to open the new campaign. He recorded impressive goals against Monaco, Rennes, Lens and Lorient. On 16 March 2002, he recorded a double in PSG&#x27;s 3–1 victory against relegation strugglers Troyes. He scored his final league goal of the season in the club&#x27;s 2–0 win over Metz on 27 April.

Ronaldinho was also influential in the 2001–02 Coupe de la Ligue, helping PSG reach the semi-finals where they were eliminated by Bordeaux. In a Round of 16 match against Guingamp, Ronaldinho scored two second-half goals in the game after having entered the match as a half-time substitute. Despite Ronaldinho&#x27;s initial success with the club, the season was marred by controversy with Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Fernández, claiming that the Brazilian was too focused on the Parisian nightlife rather than football, and complained that his holidays in Brazil never ended at the scheduled times.

==== 2002–03 season ====
Despite repeated rifts with Fernández, Ronaldinho returned to the team for the 2002–03 season, with the player switching to the number 10 shirt. Although his performances in his second season with the club were underwhelming compared to his first, Ronaldinho performed admirably with the club. On 26 October 2002, he scored two goals in PSG&#x27;s 3–1 victory over &quot;Classique&quot; rivals Marseille. The first goal was a free kick, which curled past numerous Marseille players in the 18-yard box before sailing past goalkeeper Vedran Runje. In the return match, he again scored in PSG&#x27;s 3–0 victory at the Stade Vélodrome, running half the length of the field before flicking the ball over the goalkeeper. On 22 February 2003, Ronaldinho scored the goal of the season (chosen by public vote) against Guingamp—he beat one opponent before playing a one-two to beat another, then lifted the ball over a third before beating a fourth with a step over (dropping his shoulder, moving right but going left) and finished by lifting the ball over the goalkeeper.

Ronaldinho was also praised for his performance in the Coupe de France when he scored both goals in the club&#x27;s 2–0 win over Bordeaux in the semi-finals, which inserted PSG into the final. After scoring his first goal in the 22nd minute, Ronaldinho capped the game in the 81st minute, accurately chipping the ball at the 18-yard box over the head of goalkeeper Ulrich Ramé, despite Ramé being in a favorable position. For his performance, Ronaldinho was given a standing ovation by the Parisian supporters. Unfortunately for the club, however, Ronaldinho and the team failed to capture the form that got them to the final as they bowed out 2–1 to Auxerre due to a last-minute goal from Jean-Alain Boumsong. Despite Ronaldinho&#x27;s performances, the club finished in a disappointing 11th-placed position. Following the season, Ronaldinho declared he wanted to leave the club after the capital club failed to qualify for any European competition.

=== Barcelona ===

Newly elected FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta stated, &quot;I said we would lead Barça to the forefront of the footballing world, and for that to occur we had to sign one of these three players, David Beckham, Thierry Henry or Ronaldinho.&quot; Henry remained with Arsenal, and Laporta then promised to bring Beckham to the club, but following his transfer to Real Madrid, Barcelona entered the running for Ronaldinho and outbid Manchester United for his signature in a €30 million deal.

==== 2003–04 season ====
At the club where he would spend his peak years and the basis of his global fame, Ronaldinho made his Barcelona debut in a friendly against Juventus at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts on 27 July, with coach Frank Rijkaard stating post match, &quot;He has something special every time he touches the ball.&quot; He scored his first competitive goal in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla at 1.30 a.m. local time, in a match that kicked off at five minutes past midnight. After receiving the ball from his goalkeeper inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran through the midfield and dribbled past two Sevilla players before striking the ball from 30 yards which hammered off the underside of the crossbar and back up into the roof of the net. Ronaldinho suffered from injury during the first half of the campaign, and Barcelona slumped to 12th in the league standings midway through the season. Ronaldinho returned from injury and scored 15 goals in La Liga during the 2003–04 season, helping the team ultimately finish second in the league. His scooped pass set up the winning goal for Xavi away to Real Madrid on 25 April 2004, the club&#x27;s first win at the Bernabéu in seven years, a result Xavi credits as the start of &quot;the Barcelona rise&quot;.

==== 2004–05 season ====

Ronaldinho won his first league title in 2004–05, and was named FIFA World Player of the Year on 20 December 2004. His captain at Barcelona, Carles Puyol, stated, &quot;The greatest compliment I could give him is that he&#x27;s given Barcelona our spirit back. He has made us smile again.&quot; Ronaldinho&#x27;s fame grew due to his entertaining and productive play in both the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League. On 8 March 2005, Barcelona were eliminated from the latter competition by Chelsea in the first knockout round, losing 5–4 over two legs. Ronaldinho scored both goals in the 4–2 second leg loss at Stamford Bridge in London, the second a spectacular strike where he feinted to shoot before striking the ball with little back-lift past Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech from 20 yards out.

On 1 May 2005, Ronaldinho made the assist for Lionel Messi&#x27;s first goal for Barcelona, executing a scooped pass over the Albacete defence for Messi to finish. With his contract expiring in 2008, Ronaldinho was offered an extension until 2014 that would have net him £85 million over nine years, but he turned it down. In September 2005, he signed a two-year extension that contained a minimum-fee release clause that allowed him to leave should a club make an offer to Barcelona of at least £85 million for him.

==== 2005–06 season ====

By the end of the year 2005, Ronaldinho had started to accumulate a host of personal awards. He won the inaugural FIFPro World Player of the Year in September 2005, in addition to being included in the 2005 FIFPro World XI, and being named the 2005 European Footballer of the Year. Also that year, Ronaldinho was voted the FIFA World Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. He became only the third player to win the award more than once, after three-time winners Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane. His domination as the world&#x27;s best footballer was undisputed as he also won the prestigious Ballon d&#x27;Or for the only time in his career.

On 19 November, Ronaldinho scored twice as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–0 on the road in the first leg of &quot;El Clásico&quot;. After he sealed the match with his second goal, Madrid fans paid homage to his performance by applauding, so rare a tribute only Diego Maradona had ever been granted previously as a Barcelona player at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Ronaldinho stated, &quot;I will never forget this because it is very rare for any footballer to be applauded in this way by the opposition fans.&quot;

The season is considered one of the best in Ronaldinho&#x27;s career as he was an instrumental part of Barcelona&#x27;s first Champions League title in 14 years. After winning their group convincingly, Barcelona faced Chelsea in the round of 16 for a rematch of the previous year. Ronaldinho scored a decisive goal in the second leg, going past three Chelsea defenders on the edge of the penalty area before beating the goalkeeper, sealing Barcelona&#x27;s qualification to the next round. He also contributed one goal in Barcelona&#x27;s elimination of Benfica in the quarter-finals with a 2–0 home victory. After a 1–0 semi-final aggregate win over Milan, in which Ronaldinho assisted the series&#x27; only goal by Ludovic Giuly, Barcelona progressed to the Champions League Final, which they won on 17 May 2006 with a 2–1 beating of Arsenal. Two weeks earlier, Barcelona had clinched their second-straight La Liga title with a 1–0 win over Celta de Vigo, giving Ronaldinho his first career double.

Throughout the season, Ronaldinho linked up with prolific Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto&#x27;o in attack, providing a number of assists to the 34 goal striker; Ronaldinho&#x27;s pass also put Eto&#x27;o through on goal in the Champions League Final from which he was brought down by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann who was sent off. Ronaldinho finished the season with a career-best 26 goals, including seventeen in La Liga and seven in the Champions League, and was chosen for the UEFA Team of the Year for the third consecutive time and was named the 2005–06 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year. He was named in the six man shortlist for the 2006 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.

==== 2006–07 season ====

On 25 November 2006, Ronaldinho scored his 50th career league goal against Villarreal, then scored a second time with a spectacular overhead bicycle kick; receiving Xavi&#x27;s cross, he flicked the ball up with his chest and spun 180 degrees to finish—Barcelona fans waved white handkerchiefs in admiration of the goal. After the match, he told reporters that the latter was a goal he had dreamed of scoring since he was a boy. He scored once and set up two others in Barcelona&#x27;s 4–0 Club World Cup win over Mexico&#x27;s Club América on 14 December in Yokohama, Japan, but Barcelona were defeated 1–0 by Brazilian club Internacional in the final. Ronaldinho was the recipient of the Bronze Ball Award for the competition.

The next day, Ronaldinho finished third in the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year, behind 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Zinedine Zidane. In March 2007, defending champions Barcelona were eliminated from the Champions League at the last 16 stage by Liverpool. Ronaldinho was forced to miss a charity match on 13 March due to an injury he had picked up several days earlier in Barcelona&#x27;s 3–3 &quot;El Clásico&quot; draw with Real Madrid. Although Ronaldinho scored his career-best 21 league goals, the team lost the title to Real with a worse head-to-head record, as both teams finished the season with the same number of points.

==== 2007–08 season ====

Ronaldinho played his 200th career match for Barcelona in a league match against Osasuna on 3 February 2008. His 2007–08 campaign as a whole, however, was plagued by injuries, and a muscle tear in his right leg on 3 April prematurely ended his season. Having been a model professional and devoted himself to training during his hugely successful first three seasons at Barcelona, Ronaldinho&#x27;s partying lifestyle and lack of dedication to training saw his physical condition decline, with many at the club believing he was already below his prime. On 19 May 2008, Barcelona club president Joan Laporta stated that Ronaldinho needed a &quot;new challenge&quot;, claiming that he needed a new club if he were to revive his career.

Ronaldinho and Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi each captained a team of international stars in an anti-racism exhibition match in Venezuela on 28 June, which ended in a 7–7 draw. Ronaldinho finished with a pair of goals and two assists in what would be his last match as a Barcelona player. In preparation for the 2010 Joan Gamper Trophy, Ronaldinho sent an open letter to the fans and players of Barcelona, stating that his best years had been the five he spent in the Catalan club. It was a sad moment for him and he later said in an interview that he regretted leaving without playing long enough with Messi.

=== AC Milan ===
In July 2008, Ronaldinho turned down a £25.5 million offer from Manchester City of the Premier League, with purported wages of £200,000 per week on offer, to join Italian Serie A giants AC Milan on a three-year contract thought to be worth around £5.1 million (€6.5 million) a year, for €22.05 million plus €1.05 million bonus each season (€24.15 million in 2010). With the number 10 already occupied by teammate Clarence Seedorf, he selected 80 as his jersey number.

==== 2008–09 season ====
Ronaldinho scored his first goal for Milan in a 1–0 derby victory over Inter Milan on 28 September. His first brace was in a 3–0 win over Sampdoria on 19 October. He scored a 93rd-minute match-winner against Braga in the UEFA Cup group stage on 6 November. Ronaldinho finished the 2008–09 season at Milan with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions. After a good start to the season, Ronaldinho struggled with fitness, and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan. A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism, with Carlo Ancelotti, his coach at Milan in his first season in Italy, commenting, &quot;The decline of Ronaldinho hasn&#x27;t surprised me. His physical condition has always been very precarious. His talent though has never been in question.&quot;

==== 2009–10 season ====

Ronaldinho&#x27;s second season did not begin on a high note, but he soon rediscovered his form and was arguably Milan&#x27;s best player of the season. Newly appointed coach Leonardo changed his role from a central attacking midfielder to the left side of midfield, with Alexandre Pato on the right, in an offensive 4–3–3 formation.

On 10 January 2010, Ronaldinho scored two goals against Juventus in an away match, sealing a 3–0 victory for Milan. In the following match, against Siena on 17 January, Ronaldinho scored his first hat-trick for Milan when he converted a penalty kick, scored with a header from a corner and finished with a strike into the top right corner from 20 yards out. The &quot;Estado De São Paulo&quot; newspaper declared, &quot;Ronaldinho revives his golden years&quot;. On 16 February, Ronaldinho played against Manchester United in the Champions League. He scored early in the game at the San Siro to give Milan the lead. Milan ended up losing the game 3–2, with a goal from Paul Scholes and two goals from Wayne Rooney.

Ronaldinho finished the season as the assists leader of Serie A. On a less positive note, however, he missed three penalties in the domestic season to add to one botched kick the previous season. Ronaldinho ended the Serie A campaign scoring two goals against Juventus; Luca Antonini opened the scoring and Milan went on to win 3–0 in Leonardo&#x27;s last game in charge.

==== 2010–11 season ====
During the first half of the season, Ronaldinho was part of the team&#x27;s attack that also included two new signings, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Robinho. Before the winter break, he made 16 appearances, scored one goal, and made several assists.

=== Flamengo ===

After being heavily linked with a move back to his childhood club Grêmio, Ronaldinho joined Flamengo on 11 January 2011 with a contract ending in 2014. During the transfer saga, many reports had linked the former World Player of the Year to joining different clubs, such as LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer, Blackburn Rovers of the Premier League, and Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Palmeiras. He was greeted by more than 20,000 fans at his unveiling at his new club on 13 January 2011.

Ronaldinho scored his first goal for Flamengo in the 3–2 victory against Boavista on 6 February 2011. On 27 February, he converted a second-half free kick for Flamengo to beat Boavista 1–0 and win his first piece of silverware with the team, the Taça Guanabara. Ronaldinho lifted his first trophy with Flamengo after curling in a right-footed shot over the wall in the 71st minute at Engenhão stadium. The goal gave Flamengo its 19th Taça Guanabara title, which earned the Campeonato Carioca title two months later, as the team also won the Taça Rio. On 27 July 2011, Ronaldinho scored a hat-trick in Flamengo&#x27;s 5–4 away win against rivals Santos, after being 3–0 down inside the first 30 minutes. On 31 May 2012, after being absent for a few days, he sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and cancelled his contract with the club.

=== Atlético Mineiro ===

Ronaldinho made a move to Atlético Mineiro on 4 June 2012 in a six-month contract, just four days after leaving Flamengo. He wore number 49 in reference to his mother&#x27;s birth year since his preferred number 10 was already assigned to Guilherme in the 2012 season.

Ronaldinho made his debut for Galo on 9 June 2012, playing for 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Palmeiras, and scored his first goal for the club on 23 June 2012 against Náutico, from the penalty spot. Ronaldinho led Atlético Mineiro to a good 2012 season, in which the club finished second in the 2012 Brasileirão and qualified for the 2013 Copa Libertadores. Ronaldinho won the Bola de Ouro award, selected as the best player in the league.
The following year, Ronaldinho helped Atlético win the Campeonato Mineiro and led the club to its first Copa Libertadores title. Ronaldinho scored four goals and assisted on eight occasions during Atlético&#x27;s dramatic title run, which included consecutive comebacks from 0–2 first leg defeats in both the semi-finals against Argentine club Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and the finals against Club Olimpia from Paraguay. Both ties were determined in Atlético&#x27;s favour after penalty shootouts. Although six years past his best, Ronaldinho&#x27;s displays saw him voted the 2013 South American Footballer of the Year.

At the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup held in Morocco in December, Atlético lost 3–1 to Raja Casablanca in the semi-final, with Ronaldinho scoring from a free-kick. As the final whistle blew, the Raja Casablanca team rushed to their childhood idol and stripped him down to his underpants in search of souvenirs. He renewed his contract with Atlético in January 2014. After winning the 2014 Recopa Sudamericana, Ronaldinho left the club in July, reaching an agreement to cancel his contract by mutual consent.

=== Querétaro ===
After becoming a free agent, Ronaldinho was offered contracts from English Conference South club Basingstoke Town and newly formed Indian Super League franchise Chennai Titans through their co-owner Prashant Agarwal, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Mexican club Querétaro on 5 September 2014. Ronaldinho made his debut for Querétaro in a 1–0 loss to Tigres UANL where he missed a penalty kick. In his next match, however, against Guadalajara, he had a much better game, setting up Camilo Sanvezzo to score as well as scoring himself from a penalty kick in a 4–1 win. On 30 October 2014, he scored a free kick against Atlas during an away match at the Estadio Jalisco.

On 18 April 2015, Ronaldinho scored twice against Liga MX title-holders América in an away game at the Estadio Azteca, in which his team won 4–0. All of the spectators, mostly consisting of América supporters, gave a standing ovation to Ronaldinho after his goals had brought him to tears. This was the second time in Ronaldinho&#x27;s career he had received such an ovation from opposing fans (after Madrid fans had applauded his performance in a Barcelona shirt in 2005), and after the match, Ronaldinho stated in an interview, &quot;It is an emotion to live more. I had an ovation at the Bernabéu and now here. I never imagined this. It is something that makes me like Mexico even more and I feel right at home.&quot;

Ronaldinho scored two penalties in consecutive matches, the second giving Querétaro the classification to the Liga MX playoffs. On 17 May 2015, Querétaro progressed to the semi-finals after defeating Veracruz 4–3 aggregate. In the second match, Ronaldinho scored a free kick with the help of the opponent&#x27;s goalkeeper who made contact with the ball. Querétaro eventually advanced to the final after beating Pachuca on aggregate 2–2. In the final against Santos Laguna, Querétaro lost the first leg 0–5 and then won the 2nd leg 3–0 but lost 3–5 on aggregate. In June 2015, Ronaldinho, now 35, announced his departure from the club and thanked the Mexican people and fans of Querétaro: &quot;I want to thank all the Mexican nation for all the days that I have lived with people so special, you will be forever in my heart. Thank you very much the Nation Gallos Blancos, which made me very proud to wear this shirt and defend this club.&quot;

=== Fluminense ===
On 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho announced his return to Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense, but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal. He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans. Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, &quot;Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully told us he didn&#x27;t feel he was able to perform as well as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn&#x27;t being the player he felt he could be right now. I&#x27;ll never speak about whether or not he is retiring. That&#x27;s not something you say about a player of his calibre. He was always spectacular, as player and person.&quot;

=== Futsal in India ===

In July 2016, Ronaldinho played for the &quot;Goa 5′s&quot;, a futsal team from Goa in India, together with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Míchel Salgado, and Hernán Crespo as well as futsal player Falcão in the Premier Futsal League. After two games, he left India to be an ambassador of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. He was replaced by Cafu.

From September to early October 2017, Ronaldinho joined the &quot;Delhi Dragons&quot; from Delhi in the Premier Futsal League. He scored 16 goals in eight games.

=== Retirement ===
On 16 January 2018, Ronaldinho confirmed his retirement from football through his brother/agent: &quot;He has stopped, it is ended. Let&#x27;s do something pretty big and nice after the Russia World Cup, probably in August.&quot; Such a celebration was supposed to take place three years after his last appearance for Fluminense, but has not materialized. He retired as one of just eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Ronaldinho appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 15 July, performing a few bars of the Russian folk song &quot;Kalinka&quot; (sung by opera singer Aida Garifullina) on an African drum.

== International career ==

=== Youth teams ===
In 1997, Ronaldinho was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA U-17 World Championship, which was held in Egypt, in which his first goal was a penalty against Austria in the first group match, which Brazil won 7–0. Ronaldinho finished with two goals and was awarded the Bronze Ball award as Brazil scored a total of 21 goals while only conceding 2.

1999 was a busy year for Ronaldinho in terms of international play. First he appeared in the South American Youth Championship, where he scored three goals in nine appearances and helped the U20s to reach third place. Then he took part in the that year&#x27;s FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria, scoring his first goal in Brazil&#x27;s last group match. In the round of 16, he scored two first-half goals in a 4–0 win over Croatia, and finished with three goals as Brazil were eliminated by Uruguay in the quarter-finals.

=== Early success ===
On 26 June, three days before the start of the 1999 Copa América, he earned his first cap for Brazil in a 3–0 win over Latvia, and he scored one goal during Brazil&#x27;s victorious Copa América campaign. One week after the conclusion of the Copa América, he was called up for the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he scored in every match except the final, including a hat-trick in an 8–2 semi-final rout of Saudi Arabia. In the final, Brazil lost 4–3 to Mexico. Ronaldinho won the Golden Ball award for the best player in tournament as well as the Golden Boot award for the tournament top-scorer.

In 2000, Ronaldinho participated in the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, with the U23 national team. Earlier that year, Ronaldinho led Brazil to win the Pre-Olympic Tournament, scoring nine goals in seven matches. In the Olympics, however, Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Cameroon, who later won the gold medal. Ronaldinho appeared four times and scored only one goal, which came in the quarter-final defeat by Cameroon.

=== 2002 World Cup glory ===
Ronaldinho participated in his first World Cup in 2002, as part of a formidable offensive unit with Ronaldo and Rivaldo, dubbed the &quot;Three Rs&quot;, who were also on the 1999 Copa América winning squad. The World Cup was held in South Korea and Japan, and Ronaldinho appeared in five matches during the tournament and scored two goals, as well as contributing with three assists. His first goal came in the group stage match against China PR, which Brazil won 4–0.

The most memorable match in Ronaldinho&#x27;s World Cup career took place in the quarter-final against England on 21 June. With Brazil trailing after Michael Owen&#x27;s 23-minute strike, Ronaldinho turned the game around. Having received the ball inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran at the England defence and wrong footed star defender Ashley Cole with a trademark step over before passing the ball to Rivaldo on the edge of the penalty area to score the equalising goal just before half-time. Then, in the 50th minute, Ronaldinho took a free-kick from 40 yards out which curled into the top left corner of the net, completely surprising England&#x27;s goalkeeper David Seaman, giving Brazil a 2–1 lead. Seven minutes later, he was sent off for a foul on England defender Danny Mills. Ronaldinho was suspended for the semi-final, but returned to Brazil&#x27;s starting lineup for the 2–0 victory over Germany in the final as Brazil won its record fifth World Cup title.

=== 2005 Confederations Cup title ===
Ronaldinho&#x27;s next international tournament was the 2003 Confederations Cup, in which he went scoreless as Brazil were eliminated in the group stage. The following year, he was dropped from Brazil&#x27;s 2004 Copa América squad, as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira decided to rest his stars and used a largely reserve squad.

After falling short in 1999 and 2003, Ronaldinho was the captain of Brazil and led his team to its second ever Confederations Cup title in 2005. He converted a penalty kick in a 3–2 semi-final win against host Germany and was named Man of the Match in a 4–1 victory over archrival Argentina in the final on 29 June. Ronaldinho scored three goals in the tournament and is tied with Mexican forward Cuauhtémoc Blanco as the tournament&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer with nine goals.

=== 2006 World Cup ===

For the 2006 World Cup finals, Ronaldinho was part of Brazil&#x27;s much-publicized &quot;magic quartet&quot; of offensive players alongside Adriano, Ronaldo and Kaká, which was expected to provide the &quot;Joga Bonito&quot; style of play that was the focus of an extensive advertising campaign by Nike leading up to the tournament. However, deemed &quot;top heavy and unbalanced&quot;, the team finished with ten goals in five games, with Ronaldinho himself going scoreless and finishing with only one assist (for Gilberto&#x27;s goal in a 4–1 group stage victory over Japan), as he turned in his worst collective performance in his international career. Brazil endured a disappointing campaign that culminated in a 1–0 loss to France in the quarter-finals, during which the &quot;Seleção&quot; had only one shot on goal.
The team was harshly criticized by Brazilian fans and media following their return home. On 3 July, two days after Brazil&#x27;s elimination, vandals immolated and destroyed a 23-foot (7.5-metre) tall fiberglass and resin statue of Ronaldinho in Chapecó. The statue had been erected in 2004 to celebrate his first FIFA World Player of the Year award. That same day, Ronaldinho, joined by Adriano, returned to the city of Barcelona and held a party at his home, which was continued into the early morning hours at a nightclub. This aggravated the hard feelings of many Brazilian fans, who believed that they were betrayed by the lack of effort from the squad. Displaying a passivity to Brazil&#x27;s poor showing, the 2006 World Cup is now seen as the turning point in Ronaldinho&#x27;s career, with his time at the summit of the game almost up. 1970 Brazil World Cup winner Tostão wrote in &quot;O Tempo&quot;: &quot;Ronaldinho lacks an important characteristic of Maradona and Pelé—aggression. They transformed themselves in adversity. They became possessed, and furious.&quot;

=== 2008 Olympic medal ===

On 24 March 2007, Ronaldinho scored twice in a 4–0 win over Chile, which marked his first goal since the 2005 Confederations Cup final and thus ended a scoreless streak that lasted nearly two years. He was not called up for the 2007 Copa América after asking to be excused from the tournament due to fatigue. On 18 October, he was controversially benched by Barcelona after he was late returning to Spain following Brazil&#x27;s 5–0 friendly win over Ecuador. He and several Brazil players celebrated the win by partying through the night at a posh Rio de Janeiro nightclub. Ronaldinho left at 11 am the next morning, allegedly in the trunk of a car in order to avoid the media.

On 7 July 2008, Ronaldinho was named in Brazil&#x27;s 2008 Summer Olympics squad as one of the overage players. Barcelona initially blocked the move because of his then-upcoming Champions League commitments with the club, but the decision was later nullified following Ronaldinho&#x27;s transfer to Milan, who in turn permitted him to make the trip to Beijing, China. Ronaldinho captained the team, and he scored his only two goals in a 5–0 victory over New Zealand before Brazil were beaten by Argentina in the semi-final. Brazil finished with the bronze medal after defeating Belgium 3–0 in the third-place match.

=== 2010 and 2014 World Cup absence ===
Despite having returned to good form and being named as a member of the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010, he was not named in coach Dunga&#x27;s final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup despite his deep desire to participate in the competition. Critics claimed that the exclusion of players such as Ronaldinho, Alexandre Pato, Adriano and Ronaldo signaled a move away from the classic Brazilian attacking &quot;Joga Bonito&quot; style of play. At the tournament, Brazil was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarter-final.

In September 2011, Ronaldinho made his return to the national team under coach Mano Menezes in a friendly against Ghana at Fulham&#x27;s Craven Cottage, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 win for Brazil. He then had solid performances in back to back friendlies against Argentina in the same month. In October, he performed well against Mexico in a friendly, scoring a free kick to equalize after Dani Alves was sent off. Brazil went on to win the match with a goal from Marcelo.

Ronaldinho&#x27;s good form continued in 2013, and in January he was unexpectedly called up by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for a friendly against England played on 6 February at Wembley Stadium as part of The Football Association (FA)&#x27;s 150th anniversary. Ronaldinho started in what was his 100th cap (including non-official matches), and had a chance to score from the penalty kick, but his shot was saved by Joe Hart. Brazil lost the match 1–2. He was again called up for the &quot;Seleção&quot;, being named captain of the national team for an international friendly with Chile on 24 April 2013. However, Ronaldinho was not selected for the national team for the 2013 Confederations Cup and he was also omitted from Scolari&#x27;s 2014 World Cup finals squad.

== Player profile ==
=== Style of play ===

Ronaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of all time. Due to his ability to score and create goals, he was capable of playing in several attacking positions. Throughout his career, he was often deployed as a winger, although he usually played as a classic number 10 in an attacking midfielder role. While he is naturally right-footed, during his time at Barcelona, Ronaldinho was also used as an inverted winger on the left flank at times by manager Frank Rijkaard, while the left-footed Messi was deployed on the right; this position allowed him to cut inside and shoot on goal with his stronger foot. He was also capable of playing as a second striker.

Despite primarily being a creative player, who was renowned for his passing, vision, and playmaking, Ronaldinho was an accurate finisher with either foot, both from inside and outside the penalty area, as well as being a free-kick and penalty kick specialist. Although he was primarily known for his ability to bend the ball from set pieces, he was also capable of striking the ball with power underneath the wall, and also occasionally used the &quot;knuckleball&quot; technique, which was popularised by his compatriot Juninho Pernambucano. He is widely regarded as one of the most prolific free kick takers in history, and also influenced his former teammate Messi, who went on to become a free kick specialist himself.

Throughout his career, Ronaldinho was praised by pundits in particular for his technical skills, flair, and creativity, as well as his exceptional first touch. With his pace, acceleration, athleticism, ball control, and dribbling ability, he was capable of beating players during individual runs, often using an array of tricks and feints to get past opponents in one on one situations, including step overs and nutmegs. Physically strong in possession of the ball, Richard Williams writes, &quot;Slender in build, the Brazilian has a strength belying the cartoonish smile.&quot; He also incorporated flashy moves such as back-heels, bicycle kicks, and no-look passes into his playstyle. Among his repertoire of moves is the &quot;elastico&quot;, a move he learned by watching videos of one of his idols, the 1970s Brazilian star Rivelino. Ronaldinho came to be known as one of the best exponents of the feint, and in parts of Africa—especially Nigeria—this move is now called &#x27;The Gaúcho&#x27;, due to him popularising the use of this particular skill.

=== Reception ===

ESPN described Ronaldinho as being &quot;skillful by nature, his tricks are unparalleled and he is wonderful with the ball at his feet. One of the coolest players in pressure situations&quot; and a &quot;fast, brash, skilful, tricky, an uninhibited playmaker&quot; who provides &quot;a mix of goals, assists, skills and a large repertoire of crafty moves&quot;. Zlatan Ibrahimović stated, &quot;Prime Ronaldinho was phenomenal. He made his opponents look like children.&quot; Former Portugal midfield playmaker Rui Costa has said of his vision and passing ability: &quot;There are not many players who can offer goal-scoring passes like he can. He is just marvellous. He is a rare case of an assist man who can provide the ball from anywhere.&quot; In 2010, his former Barcelona teammate, Edgar Davids, said of him: &quot;For the skills and tricks, Ronaldinho was the best player that I ever played with.&quot; Another one of his former Barcelona teammate, Henrik Larsson, echoed this view. His compatriot Willian rated him as the greatest player of all time in 2019, while Juninho described him as the most skilful player he had ever seen. In 2019, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; described him as &quot;possibly the best technician in the history of football in Brazil&quot;, placing him at number five in their list of &quot;The 101 greatest football players of the last 25 years&quot;. In 2006, Richard Williams of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Ronaldinho as a &quot;genius&quot;, while his former Barcelona teammate Sylvinho said of him: &quot;He&#x27;s so smart, so intelligent, that sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to read his mind&quot;, also adding: &quot;He&#x27;s amazing. He&#x27;s 100% talent. And he&#x27;s a powerful player as well, so it&#x27;s difficult to stop him.&quot;

In spite of his performances at his peak, a period of dedication and focus which saw him named the FIFA World Player of the Year twice and receive the Ballon d&#x27;Or, Ronaldinho was also criticised on occasion in the media for his lack of discipline in training, as well as his hedonistic lifestyle off the pitch, which impacted the overall longevity of his career. Referring to Ronaldinho as &quot;Brazil&#x27;s childlike genius who never grew up&quot;, Tim Vickery writes that it was the sudden death of his father at such a young age that may have seen Ronaldinho shy away from remaining at the top, with the attitude of &quot;life is short and can end unexpectedly—so enjoy it while you can&quot;.

== Outside football ==

Ronaldinho has had endorsements with many companies, including Nike, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, EA Sports and Danone. One of the world&#x27;s highest paid players, in 2006 he earned over $19 million from endorsements. Having endorsed Pepsi for much of his career and appeared in commercials with David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho signed a deal with Coca-Cola in 2011, however this was terminated in July 2012 after he was caught drinking Pepsi in a news conference.

Ronaldinho has featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, appearing on the cover of &quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot;, &quot;FIFA Street&quot;, &quot;FIFA 06&quot;, &quot;FIFA 07&quot;, &quot;FIFA Street 3&quot;, &quot;FIFA 08&quot; and &quot;FIFA 09&quot;. At the beginning of his career Ronaldinho signed a lucrative 10-year deal with sportswear company Nike (wearing Nike Tiempo R10 boots designed for him). He has appeared in Nike commercials, including the 2002 &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam. His 2005 Nike advertisement, where he is given a new pair of boots and then proceeds to juggle a football and appears to repeatedly volley it against the crossbar of a goal and recover it without the ball touching the ground, went viral on YouTube, becoming the site&#x27;s first video to reach one million views. A 2010 Nike commercial, Write the Future directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, features Ronaldinho executing a number of stepovers, which became a viral video re-enacted and shared millions of times.

A wax sculpture of Ronaldinho was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong in December 2007. Ronaldinho has had an official role with UNICEF, the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund, since February 2006. In 2011, he was recruited by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to promote awareness among young people of the disease and how to avoid it. In March 2015, Ronaldinho was the sixth most popular sportsperson on Facebook, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Beckham, Neymar and Kaká, with 31 million Facebook fans. Ronaldinho also has over 50 million Instagram followers.

On 2 February 2017, Barcelona announced that Ronaldinho signed a 10-year deal to become an ambassador for the club at institutional events. On 6 July 2018, Ronaldinho announced a partnership with company World Soccer Coin (WSC) to develop a new cryptocurrency, the Ronaldinho Soccer Coin, with WSC claiming that the profits of the coin will be used to football projects such as &quot;Ronaldinho Digital Stadiums&quot;.

On 29 October 2020, Ronaldinho released a statement regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and Azerbaijan. He expressed solidarity with Azerbaijani people. In late July 2021, he went to Beirut, Lebanon, to lay a wreath in honor of victims of the port explosion.

In fiction, Ronaldinho features as a character in Rupert Thomson&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Barcelona Dreaming&quot;.

In 2018, he appeared in the American martial arts film &quot;&quot;, alongside Alain Moussi and Jean-Claude Van Damme.

===&quot;Ronaldinho Gaúcho&quot; (comic strip)===
&quot;Ronaldinho Gaúcho&quot; is a Brazilian celebrity comic strip by Mauricio de Sousa, syndicated by Atlantic Syndication. It features a fictionalised version of the Ronaldinho as a child. The strip was created in 2006, when the 2006 FIFA World Cup was taking place in Germany. It ran until 2015.

It was adapted into an animated television series as &quot;Ronaldinho Gaúcho&#x27;s Team&quot;, produced by Italian studio GIG Italy Entertainment, with the coproduction of MSP (Mauricio de Sousa Produções).

In 2014, because of the FIFA World Cup held in Brazil, Ronaldinho Gaúcho&#x27;s short animated series was acquired by the paid children&#x27;s channel Gloob, at the same time, the Discovery Kids channel aired the series &quot;Pelezinho in: Planet Soccer&quot;. The series &quot;Pelezinho in: Planet Soccer&quot; was also launched, usually passing during Discovery Kids commercials, and Neymar Jr. by Nickelodeon.

=== Legal troubles ===
In July 2019, 57 properties belonging to Ronaldinho along with his Brazilian and Spanish passports were confiscated because of unpaid taxes and fines. The judge ultimately decided to reduce the fine from R$8.5 million to R$6 million for building a fishing platform on Guaíba River in a &#x27;heritage-protected&#x27; area. Ronaldinho and his brother would ultimately fail to pay the fines within the allotted time and have their passports suspended.

In March 2020, he was questioned by police in Paraguay after he was alleged to have used a fake passport to enter the country while coming for a charity event and book promotion, with Ronaldinho and his brother both being held in custody in the country. A lawyer representing Ronaldinho and his brother could not explain why they used fake passports to enter the country; as Brazilian nationals do not require a passport to countries that are members of the Mercosur trade bloc. While in prison he competed in a prison futsal tournament, where his team was victorious. They won 11–2 in the finals, with Ronaldinho scoring 5 goals and assisting the other 6. He attempted to appeal the detention order but was ordered to remain under house arrest with his brother. On 24 August 2020, Ronaldinho and his brother were released from Paraguayan prison after their judge agreed to a plea deal with fines of US$90,000 and US$110,000 for the brothers, respectively.

== Personal life ==
Growing up, Ronaldinho&#x27;s idols included the World Cup–winning stars Rivelino (from 1970); Diego Maradona (from 1986); Romário (from 1994); and his two future international teammates Ronaldo and Rivaldo (who would, together with him, form the attacking trio in Brazil&#x27;s 2002 World Cup–winning team). Ronaldinho is the father of a son, João, born on 25 February 2005, to Brazilian dancer Janaína Mendes and named after his late father. He gained Spanish citizenship in 2007. In March 2018, Ronaldinho joined the Brazilian Republican Party, which has links to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. Ronaldinho endorsed presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election. 

A longtime supporter of the Catholic Church, Ronaldinho was baptized in 2023.

In 2012, two Brazilian entomologists named a new species of bee, from Brazil, &quot;Eulaema quadragintanovem&quot;, stating that &quot;the specific epithet honors the Brazilian soccer player Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, famous worldwide as &#x27;Ronaldinho&#x27; and in Brazil as &#x27;Ronaldinho Gaúcho&#x27;. &quot;Quadraginta novem&quot; means &#x27;forty-nine&#x27; in Latin, the number of Ronaldinho&#x27;s jersey at Atlético Mineiro, his former team in Brazil. Ronaldinho chose the number 49 as an homage to his mother, born in 1949.&quot;

<text>Michael David Apted (10 February 1941 – 7 January 2021) was an English television and film director and producer.

Apted began working in television and directed the &quot;Up&quot; documentary series (1964–2019). He later directed &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980), which was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. His subsequent work included &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1988), &quot;Nell&quot; (1994), &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999), and &quot;Enigma&quot; (2001). His film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (2006) premiered at the closing of the Toronto International Film Festival that year.

On 29 June 2003, he was elected president of the Directors Guild of America, a position he served until 2009. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

==Early life and education ==
Apted was born on 10 February 1941 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the son of Frances Amelia (née Thomas) and Ronald William Apted.

He was educated at City of London School and Downing College, Cambridge, where he studied law and history.

==Career==
===Television===
Apted began his career in television as a trainee for six months at Granada Television in Manchester, where he worked as a researcher. One of his first projects at Granada would become his best known: the &quot;Up &quot;series, which began in 1964 as a profile of 14 seven-year-old children for the current affairs series &quot;World in Action.&quot; As a researcher and assistant to Canadian director Paul Almond, Apted was involved in selecting the children, who came from a variety of backgrounds and classes. Though originally conceived as a one-off documentary, the series has become an institution. When it was suggested that they revisit the subjects at ages fourteen and twenty one, Apted accepted the offer to direct and directed every subsequent episode in the series. It explores Apted&#x27;s thesis that the British class system remains largely in place. It studies the participants based on the Jesuit motto &quot;Give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man&quot;, looking at how they develop during their lives, compared to when they were seven. The series looks at the lives of these people over the years; the latest instalment, &quot;63 Up&quot;, was produced in 2019. It won a Peabody Award in 2012 &quot;for its creator’s patience and its subjects&#x27; humanity.&quot;

During his seven-year period of working at Granada, Apted also directed a number of episodes of &quot;Coronation Street,&quot; then written by Jack Rosenthal, among others. Apted and Rosenthal later collaborated on a number of popular television and film projects, including the pilot episodes for &quot;The Dustbinmen&quot; and &quot;The Lovers&quot;. They worked together again in 1982 for the TV movie &quot;P&#x27;tang, Yang, Kipperbang&quot;, the first film commissioned by Britain&#x27;s Channel 4. In 1976 Apted directed a play in the Granada TV series &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot;. The episode was &quot;The Collection&quot; by Harold Pinter. The play starred Laurence Olivier, Malcolm McDowell, Alan Bates and Helen Mirren.

Apted used his idea from the &quot;Up&quot; series a second time in &quot;Married in America&quot; and &quot;Married in America 2&quot;. The idea was to interview nine married couples every two years over a ten-year period to tell a more complete story of their marriages. In 2005, he directed the first three episodes of the TV series &quot;Rome&quot;.

For his work in television, Apted won several British Academy Awards, including two Flaherty Documentary Awards for his work on 28 &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;35 Up&quot; and a BAFTA for Best Dramatic Director for the single play &quot;Kisses at Fifty&quot; in 1974.

===Film===
Apted made his first feature film in 1972, &quot;The Triple Echo&quot;, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson, and he directed two films for David Puttnam. &quot;The Triple Echo&quot; was entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival. He alternated this work with working on the TV series &quot;Play for Today&quot;. He directed six plays including &quot;Stronger than the Sun&quot;, written by Stephen Poliakoff and starring Francesca Annis as a young woman who places her life in danger to expose a crime, a theme Apted returned to several times.

In 1979 he directed the Hollywood-financed &quot;Agatha&quot;, featuring Vanessa Redgrave. He went to the United States in 1980, where he directed &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, which received seven Academy Award nominations, winning best actress for Sissy Spacek. Both Spacek and Loretta Lynn, the subject of the film, have said that they believe Apted&#x27;s outsider point of view was crucial to the movie&#x27;s success in securing the participation of Appalachian residents and to the avoidance of stereotypes that previously had marred portrayals of mountain culture. In 2019, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Apted also made several films with a strong social message or that deal with an ethical dilemma. In 1983 he directed &quot;Gorky Park&quot;, a political thriller based on the novel by Martin Cruz Smith, that deals with police corruption in the former Soviet Union. &quot;Class Action&quot; deals with a corporate whistleblower, and &quot;Extreme Measures&quot; is about medical ethics. &quot;Class Action&quot; was entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.

In 1994, he directed &quot;Nell&quot;, which received three Golden Globe Award nominations and one Academy Award nomination.

In 1999, Apted directed the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

===Documentary===
In addition to the &quot;Up&quot; series, Apted made other documentaries, including &quot;Bring On the Night&quot;, a feature-length concert film about the making of Sting&#x27;s first solo album. He directed the documentary &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, which was released in 1989. It chronicled the UK, US and USSR adventures of Boris Grebenshchikov, the first Soviet underground musician allowed to record in the West.

Before the making of &quot;Thunderheart&quot;, Apted made the documentary &quot;Incident at Oglala&quot; about Leonard Peltier. &quot;Incident at Oglala&quot; then informed &quot;Thunderheart&quot; in the casting of actors for the fiction film.

In 1997, he explored the creative process in &quot;Inspirations&quot; through candid discussion with seven artists from diverse media, including David Bowie, Louise Lecavalier and Roy Lichtenstein among others.

In a departure from his earlier work, from 1992 to 1994, Apted ventured into China&#x27;s rapidly changing popular culture. In a project backed by Trudie Styler, Apted directed &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot;, a feature documentary which probed the origins of the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square and the consequences of the movement in the lives of several of the movement&#x27;s student leaders.

In 2006, Apted co-directed &quot;The Official Film of the 2006 FIFA World Cup&quot;, narrated by Pierce Brosnan.

Apted was the collaborator and subject of the documentary: &quot;Michael Apted – Visions on Film&quot;, by artist and filmmaker Melinda Camber Porter.

===Theatre===
In 1977, Apted directed the premiere of &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; at the National Theatre in London.

==Personal life and death==
Apted&#x27;s first marriage was to Jo, with whom he had two sons, Paul and Jim. Paul Apted was a sound editor who worked on movies such as &quot;The Wolverine&quot;; he died from colon cancer in 2014.

He was married to screenwriter Dana Stevens for 10 years, before they divorced. They had a son, John.

In 2007 Apted became a father for the fourth time, to a girl, who lives with her mother Tania Mellis.

Apted married Paige Simpson, his third wife, in January 2014.

Apted died at his home in Los Angeles on 7 January 2021, at the age of 79.

<text>A space fountain is a proposed form of an extremely tall tower extending into space. As known materials cannot support a static tower with this height, a space fountain has to be an active structure: A stream of pellets is accelerated upwards from a ground station. At the top it is deflected downwards. The necessary force for this deflection supports the station at the top and payloads going up the structure. A spacecraft could launch from the top without having to deal with the atmosphere. This could reduce the cost of placing payloads into orbit. Its largest downside is that the tower will re-enter the atmosphere if the accelerator fails and the stream stops. This risk could be reduced by several redundant streams.

The lower part of a pellet stream has to be in a vacuum tube to avoid excessive drag in the atmosphere. Similar to the top station, this tube can be supported by its own system of transferring momentum from a space-bound stream to a surface-bound stream. If the tube itself also accelerates the station-supporting stream, it would have to transfer additional momentum to an earth-bound stream in order to keep itself supported. The tube-supporting streams could also be designed to integrate with the station-supporting streams.

Unlike a space elevator, this concept does not need extremely strong materials anywhere, and unlike space elevators and orbital rings, it does not need a long structure.

Marjorie Boulton studied English at Somerville College, Oxford where she was taught by C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. She was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2008.

She taught English literature in teacher training and (from 1962 to 1970) as a college principal for 24 years before turning to full-time research and writing. She is a well-known writer in Esperanto. Boulton in her later years was president of two Esperanto organisations, Kat-amikaro and ODES.

She was the author of &quot;Zamenhof: Creator of Esperanto&quot; — a biography of L. L. Zamenhof published in 1960 by Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul of London. She also wrote a widely-used series of introductory texts on literary studies: &quot;The Anatomy of Poetry&quot; (1953), &quot;The Anatomy of Prose&quot; (1954), &quot;The Anatomy of Drama&quot; (1960), &quot;The Anatomy of Language&quot; (1968), &quot;The Anatomy of the Novel&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Anatomy of Literary Studies&quot; (1980). Her first book was &quot;Preliminaries: Poems&quot; (1949). Later books of poetry, as well as short story collections, were in Esperanto, which she learnt in 1949. She wrote as well &quot;Saying What We Mean&quot; (1959), &quot;Words in Real Life&quot; (1965) and &quot;Reading in Real Life&quot; (1971). She had also translated Harivansh Rai Bachchan&#x27;s &quot;Madhushala&quot; (1935) to English.

Boulton was an active member of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA), the Esperanto Association of Britain (EAB) and several Esperanto groups, as well as a UEA delegate, wherein she gave lectures, taught, and wrote articles.

From 1957 to 1962, she became the secretary of the International Summer University (ISU), which took place annually as part of the Esperanto World Congresses. From 1961 to 1967, she was secretary of the Esperanto World Federation (UEA) Commission for International Examination. For 25 years, she ran the summer Esperanto courses in Barlaston, south of Stoke-on-Trent. She was chairwoman of the Society of British Esperanto Teachers (1969) and a member of the Akademio de Esperanto since 1967.

<text>Alan Philip Eric Knott (born 9 April 1946) is a former cricketer who represented England at international level in both Tests and One-Day Internationals (ODI). Knott is widely regarded as one of the most eccentric characters in cricket and as one of the greatest wicket-keepers ever to play the game. He was described by cricket journalist Simon Wilde as &quot;a natural gloveman, beautifully economical in his movements and armed with tremendous powers of concentration&quot;.

On the occasion of England&#x27;s 1000th Test in August 2018 he was named in the country&#x27;s greatest Test XI by the England and Wales Cricket Board.

==Early life==
Born in Belvedere, Kent, Knott was educated at Belmont Primary School and Northumberland Heath Secondary Modern School. Encouraged by his father, he made his Kent debut in 1964 at the age of 18, joining the list of well-known Kent wicket-keepers.

==Playing career==
A servant for Kent for over twenty years, helping them to a number of successes such as in the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1973 and 1976, in the Gillette Cup in 1974 (where he was man of the match in the final), and to a share of the 1977 County Championship, Knott scored over 18000 first-class runs and made 1344 first-class wicketkeepting dismissals, placing him fourth on the all-time list (behind only Bob Taylor, John Murray and Bert Strudwick).

He gained his first Test cap at the age of 21, having been named Cricket Writers&#x27; Club Young Cricketer of the Year in 1965. He made his Test debut against Pakistan in 1967. Batting at number 8, he made a duck in his first Test, at Trent Bridge, but didn&#x27;t concede a single bye in the match. He made 28 in the second match but didn&#x27;t make the starting eleven for the 1967–68 tour of the West Indies, as Jim Parks was initially preferred. However, for the fourth and fifth matches of the series he was picked again. In the first of those he made his first Test half-century, a score of 69 not out, and he once again excelled at wicket-keeping.

In the fifth Test at Bourda in Georgetown, Knott produced what he regarded as the innings of his career. On the last day, with England needing only to draw the match in order to win the series, off-spinner Lance Gibbs took three quick wickets to have England teetering at 41 for 5 when Knott joined his captain Colin Cowdrey at the crease. The two of them combined for a 127-run stand and when Cowdrey was dismissed for 82, there was still over an hour for the West Indies to claim the four remaining wickets. By the final over, Knott was still in, but with him was the number 11 batsman Jeff Jones. Amidst the tension - which was too much for Cowdrey and Tom Graveney, who had gone and locked themselves in the toilets - Knott stayed calm and guided Jones through the final over to obtain the draw.

In the winter of 1968/69, again against Pakistan, Knott confirmed his position as England&#x27;s premier wicketkeeper-batsman. He made two 50s in the series, including 96 not out at Karachi when the match was prematurely ended by a pitch invasion by Pakistani fans, denying him a well-deserved hundred.

In 1970 Knott was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. County captain Colin Cowdrey said:

I think he is the most gifted and dedicated cricketer one could ever wish to play with, never satisfied with his performance and always seeking for a little more perfection.

In the 1970–71 series in Australia he was instrumental in England regaining the Ashes, taking five catches and stumping Doug Walters in the decisive Seventh Test in Sydney. In the following series against New Zealand he finally made his maiden Test century, 110 at Auckland, having missed the first match of the series, so that Bob Taylor could take the gloves as a reward for patience as reserve keeper on the four-month combined tour. Knott did not miss a Test until 1977, making a sum of five centuries and twenty-eight 50s in that time.

Knott was with England when they lost the Ashes in 1974–5, but achieved a landmark in the fifth Test at Adelaide, &quot;Wisden&quot; reporting that Knott&#x27;s 106 not out was &quot;only the second hundred by a wicket-keeper in the 219 Tests between England and Australia. Kent and England also claimed the first one in 1934 when L.E.G. Ames scored 120 at Lord&#x27;s&quot;, and Knott would also make the fourth at Nottingham in 1977 (Rod Marsh making one in the intervening period in the Centenary Test of 1977).

He has the distinction of once scoring 7 runs from a single delivery in Test cricket, off Vanburn Holder in the Fourth England v West Indies Test at Headingley in 1976. Knott took a quick single to extra-cover where Bernard Julien fielded and overthrew the wicket-keeper. Knott and Tony Greig ran two overthrows before Andy Roberts, fielding at square-leg, retrieved the ball and threw it past the stumps at the bowler&#x27;s end and over the long-off boundary for four more runs.

Knott helped England regain the Ashes in England in 1977. His highest score of 135 came in the third test of this series, helping to turn the tide in a struggling England innings. This remains as of 2022 the highest score by an England wicket-keeper in the Ashes. Previously however he had been persuaded by England colleague Tony Greig to join Kerry Packer&#x27;s World Series Cricket. This effectively put his England career on hold as the &#x27;Packer players&#x27; were banned from Test cricket. When he returned to Tests after the end of World Series Cricket in 1980, he had very little success against a mighty West Indian side, averaging 5.14 in the series. He did not play in the tour of the West Indies that immediately followed, but was picked for the final two Tests of the famous 1981 Ashes series. Fittingly for one of England&#x27;s greatest players, he ended his last Test against Australia at The Oval, with a score of 70 not out and an England series win, the fourth time he had ended a series on the side that won or retained the Ashes.

Knott played for England in 20 one-day internationals, including the first one-day international of all and all of their matches in the first Cricket World Cup. He captained England in one one-day international in 1976 against the West Indies, incidentally the match in which Ian Botham made his international debut, and Graham Gooch his one-day international debut.

Knott&#x27;s England career came to an end when he chose to take part in the first rebel tour to South Africa in 1981-82, in defiance of the sporting ban against the apartheid state. For this he and the other rebels were banned from international cricket for three years. However, when the ban had expired, during the 1985 County Championship season, there were still some media commentators suggesting a recall to the Test team.

After 22 seasons with Kent Knott announced his retirement from cricket at the end of that season aged 39. He was still regarded as one of the finest wicketkeepers in the country, and his reasons for retirement included concern over an ankle injury as well as concentrating on his sports shop in Herne Bay, Kent, and gymnasium business.

==Playing style and eccentricities==
Knott was known for his idiosyncratic behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; his sleeves rolled down to safeguard his elbows when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew, warming his hands with hot water before going onto the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of chamois inners with strips of plasticine across the palms.

==Life post-career==
After retiring from playing Knott was employed by the England management as a part-time wicketkeeping coach and assessor of Test cricketers. He would have taken up a specialist wicketkeeping coaching position but it never materialized. In the early 2000s he and his wife moved to Paphos, Cyprus.

In the October 2004 edition of &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot; magazine he was voted as the wicketkeeper in &quot;England&#x27;s Greatest post-war XI&quot;, receiving votes from 20 of the 25 panellists.

In an article written in 2008 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; journalist Michael Henderson, comparing Knott with Adam Gilchrist, called Knott the greatest wicketkeeper-batsman, without argument, as opposed to Gilchrist, whom he called a batsman-wicketkeeper.

On 6 September 2009 Alan Knott was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, and in 2013 he was named in Wisden&#x27;s all-time Test World XI.

His son James has also played first-class cricket for Surrey and Minor counties cricket for Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire.

Knott was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to cricket.

<doc id="524596" wikidata="Q1753988" url="?curid=524596" title="Hatful of Hollow">
<text>Hatful of Hollow is a compilation album by English rock band the Smiths, released on 2 November 1984 by Rough Trade Records. The album features tracks from BBC Radio 1 sessions, their first single &quot;Hand in Glove&quot; (a different mix of which had been included on their first album) and two new singles and their B-sides. It was eventually released in the United States on 9 November 1993 by Sire Records, who had initially declined to release the album in the US. Sire instead released &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; in the US in 1987—which is effectively a hybrid of &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; and a subsequent UK compilation album &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; plus some tracks which do not appear on either.

&quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart, remaining on the chart for 46 weeks. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at No. 44 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;.

==Composition==
The album consists mainly of songs recorded over several BBC Radio 1 sessions in 1983. Tracks shown in bold were included on the album.

# For John Peel on 18 May 1983 (broadcast 31 May): &quot;Handsome Devil&quot;, &quot;Reel Around the Fountain&quot;, &quot;Miserable Lie&quot;, &quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot; (all four songs were later released as the &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; EP)

# For Jensen on 25 August 1983 (broadcast 5 September): &quot;Accept Yourself&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Owe You Anything&quot;, &quot;Pretty Girls Make Graves&quot;, &quot;Reel Around the Fountain&quot;
# For Peel on 14 September 1983 (broadcast 21 September): &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, &quot;Back to the Old House&quot;, &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Still Ill&quot;

When first broadcast, these radio sessions mainly featured songs which were otherwise unavailable. All were subsequently re-recorded for singles or for the band&#x27;s debut album the following year. &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot; was recorded in the studio in June 1984, but the only version ever released was the September Peel session.

&quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; also features the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Hand in Glove&quot;, and their two most recent singles prior to the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Heaven Knows I&#x27;m Miserable Now&quot; and &quot;William, It Was Really Nothing&quot;, along with their respective B-sides, &quot;Girl Afraid&quot;, &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; and &quot;Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want&quot;.

&quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; would receive a separate single release in 1985 in both the UK and the US. It reached No. 24 in the British charts, but failed to chart in the US. Morrissey and Johnny Marr lamented the lack of chart success of what they considered their strongest song thus far.

==Song differences==

The radio session versions of songs are different from other studio recordings. Some of the major differences are:

*&quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot; has heavier and more natural-sounding guitars than the version on &quot;The Smiths&quot;. It is also in a higher key than the version on &quot;The Smiths&quot;.
*&quot;These Things Take Time&quot; features bass that is more prominent and drums that are less controlled than in the version from the &quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot; 12-inch single and on &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;. Sliding guitar figures accompany the chorus.
*&quot;This Charming Man&quot; has softer and more upbeat vocals, guitars and even drums than the version released as a single and on some versions of &quot;The Smiths&quot;. The bass line is louder and altered slightly. Additionally, there is no solo guitar introduction.
*&quot;Still Ill&quot; opens and closes with a harmonica solo, and sounds less hollow and slightly slower than the version on &quot;The Smiths&quot;.
*&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Everything Now&quot; is slower than the version on &quot;The Smiths&quot; and does not have any keyboard part. The bass line is also altered slightly.
*&quot;Back to the Old House&quot; is an acoustic piece with melancholic guitars and vocals, as opposed to the full band version on the &quot;What Differences Does It Make?&quot; single.
*&quot;Reel Around the Fountain&quot; has duller-sounding drums and acoustic guitars than the version on &quot;The Smiths&quot;. The bass is more prominent, but the piano and organ parts are not included. It is also in a higher key than the version on &quot;The Smiths&quot;.

In addition, the original single version of &quot;Hand in Glove&quot; is included, not the remixed version that appears on &quot;The Smiths&quot;. It features a fade-intro and fade-out, louder bass, and vocals that sound very distant.

==Cover and artwork==
The current sleeve for &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; is the CD issue sleeve, featuring a cropped photograph of the otherwise unknown Fabrice Colette taken by Gilles Decroix. The original sleeve, pictured above, included a tattoo of a Jean Cocteau drawing on Colette&#x27;s left shoulder, which Colette commissioned in June 1983 because he idolised Cocteau. The photograph is taken from a July 1983 special edition of the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;. Additionally, the old cover had a large sky-blue frame with the legends &quot;The Smiths&quot; and &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; above and striking through the picture. Editions after 1987 feature the cropped version with the text superimposed, although the 2011 vinyl re-issue reinstated the original sleeve.

&quot;THE IMPOTENCE OF ERNEST&quot; is etched into the runout groove of side A. As well as being a pun on Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, it is an allusion to the impotence that Ernest Hemingway suffered in his final years. &quot;Ian (EIRE)&quot;, etched on side B, refers to Marr&#x27;s younger brother.
