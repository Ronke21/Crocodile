<text>A light fighter or lightweight fighter is a fighter aircraft towards the low end of the practical range of weight, cost, and complexity over which fighters are fielded. The light or lightweight fighter retains carefully selected competitive features, in order to provide cost-effective design and performance.

A well-designed lightweight fighter is able to match or better a heavier type plane-for-plane in many missions, and for lower cost. The lightweight class can therefore be strategically valuable.

In attempts to scale this efficiency to still lower cost, some manufacturers have in recent years adopted the term “light fighter” to also refer to light primarily air-to-ground attack aircraft, some of which are modified trainer designs. These lower cost lightweight attack aircraft have become known as light combat aircraft (LCAs), and are sometimes considered to include some multirole light fighters.

From 1926 the light fighter concept has been a regular thread in the development of fighter aircraft, with some notable designs entering large-scale use.

==Design aims==
A key design goal of light/lightweight fighter design is to satisfy standard air-to-air fighter effectiveness requirements at minimum cost. These criteria, in order of importance, are the ability to benefit from the element of surprise, to have numerical superiority in the air, to have superior maneuverability, and to possess adequate weapon systems effectiveness. Light fighters typically achieve a surprise advantage over larger aircraft due to smaller visual and radar signatures, which is important since in the majority of air-to-air kills, the element of surprise is dominant. Their comparative lower cost and higher reliability also allows for greater numbers per budget. Finally, while a single engine light fighter would typically only carry about half the weapons load of a heavy twin engine fighter, its surprise and maneuverability advantages often allow it to gain positional advantage to make better use of those weapons.

A requirement for low cost and therefore small fighters first arose in the period between World War I and World War II. Examples include several RAF interceptor designs from the interwar era and French &quot;Jockey&quot; aircraft of the immediate pre-World War II. None of these very light fighters enjoyed success into World War II, as they were too hampered in performance. Similar to the meaning of lightweight fighter today, during World War II the term “small fighter” was used to describe a single engine aircraft of competitive performance, range, and armament load, but with no unnecessary weight and cost.

===Effectiveness===

The modern view of light/lightweight fighters is as a capable weapon intended to satisfy the main criteria of air-to-air combat effectiveness, which in order of importance, are:

1. Superiority in the element of surprise, to be aware of the enemy before they are aware of you. In past combats, surprise advantage has been mostly based upon small visual and radar signatures, and having good visibility out of the cockpit. Surprise is a significant advantage, since historically in about 80% of air-to-air kills, the victim was unaware of the attacker until too late.
Small fighters like the F-5 with a planform area of about or the F-16 at about , compared to about for the F-15, have a much lower visual profile. The small fighter is typically invisible to opposing pilots beyond about , whereas a larger fighter such as the F-15 is visible to about . This is a non-linear advantage to the light fighter opposing a heavy fighter. Additionally, smaller targets take longer to visually acquire even if they are visible. These two factors together give the light fighter pilot much better statistical odds of seeing the heavy fighter first and setting up a decisive first shot. Once the small fighter sees and turns towards the opponent its very small frontal area reduces maximum visual detection range to about .

Given similar technology, smaller fighters typically have about two thirds the radar range against the same target as heavy fighters. However, this cannot be counted upon to give the large fighter a winning advantage, as larger fighters with typical radar cross sectional area of about are detectable by a given radar at about 50% farther range than the cross section of the light fighter. This approximately balances these trade-offs, and can sometimes favor the lightweight fighter. For example, from the front the F-15 actually presents about radar cross sectional area, and has been typically defeated by opposing F-16 forces not only in close dogfighting combat, but also in extensive Beyond Visual Range (BVR) trials. Also, airborne fighter radars are limited: their coverage is only to the front, and are far from perfect in detecting enemy aircraft. Although radar was extensively used by the United States in the Vietnam War, only 18% of North Vietnamese fighters were first detected by radar, and only 3% by radar on fighter aircraft. The other 82% were visually acquired.

The modern trend to stealth aircraft is an attempt to maximize surprise in an era when Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles are becoming more effective than the quite low effectiveness BVR has had in the past.

2. Numerical superiority in the air, which implies the need for lower procurement cost, lower maintenance cost, and higher reliability. Not even taking into account the sometimes superior combat capability of lighter aircraft based on surprise and maneuverability, the pure numbers issue of lower cost and higher reliability (higher sortie rates) also tends to favor light fighters. It is a basic outcome of Lanchester&#x27;s laws, or the salvo combat model, that a larger number of less-sophisticated units will tend to be successful over a smaller number of more advanced ones; the damage dealt is based on the square of the number of units firing, while the quality of those units has only a linear effect on the outcome. This non-linear relationship favors the light and lightweight fighter.

Additionally, as pilot capability is actually the top consideration in maximizing total effectiveness of the pilot-aircraft system, the lower purchase and operational cost of light fighters permits more training, thus delivering more effective pilots. For example, as of 2013, total heavy F-15C operating cost is reported at US$41,900 per hour, and light F-16C cost at US$22,500 per hour.

3. Superior maneuverability, which in maneuvering combat allows getting into superior position to fire and score the kill. This is a function of achieving lower wing loading, higher thrust to weight ratio, and superior aerodynamics. This is sometimes described colloquially as “wrapping the smallest possible airframe around the most powerful available engine.” Professional analysis through 4th generation fighters shows that among heavier fighters only the F-15 has been generally competitive with lighter fighters, and its maneuvering performance is exceeded by several lighter fighters such as the F-16. Light fighters have no inherent aerodynamic advantage for speed and range, but when designed to be as simple as possible they do tend to have lower wing loading and higher thrust to weight ratio. Additionally, smaller fighters are lower in inertia, allowing a faster transient response in maneuvering combat.

4. Weapon systems effectiveness. This area is one where the light fighter can be at a disadvantage, since the combat load of a single engine light fighter is typically about half of a twin engine heavy fighter. However, modern single engine light fighters such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen generally carry similar cannon and air-to-air missile fighter weapons as heavier fighters. Actual aerial combat in the modern era is of short duration, typically about two minutes, and as only a small fraction of this is spent actually firing, modest weapons load outs are generally effective. The ideal weapons load for a modern fighter is considered to be an internal gun and two to four guided missiles, a load that modern light fighters are fully capable of while maintaining high agility. For example, the JAS 39 Gripen, despite being the lightest major fighter in current production, carries a combat load of a 27mm cannon and up to six air-to-air missiles of the same types as carried by heavy fighters. Additionally, combat experience shows that weapons systems &quot;effectiveness&quot; has not been dominated by the amount of weaponry or &quot;load out&quot;, but by the ability to achieve split second kills when in position to do so.

===Concept summary===

Superior technology has often been quoted as a strong factor favoring the heavy fighter. The specific argument usually presented is that heavy fighters have superior radar range and longer range BVR missiles that take advantage of that range. This radar range advantage is one of the major reasons for the existence of the modern heavy fighter, but it has not turned out to be a significant advantage in air combat history to date for several reasons. A major reason has been because long range BVR missile shots have often been unusable, and often unreliable when they could be taken. The weight of the larger missiles also reduces performance and range needed to get in position to fire. Due to these factors, between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, but there were only four beyond-visual-range kills.

The more general and often misunderstood argument for more technology that has been historically assumed to favor heavy fighters is not just better radar but better systems support for the fighter pilot in other ways as well. Examples include all weather capability, precise electronic navigation, electronic counter-measures, data-linking for improved information awareness, and automation to lighten pilot workload and keep the pilot focused on tasks essential to combat. This was a compelling argument, as the greatest factor in the effectiveness of a fighter plane has always been the pilot. Quoting a prominent reference, &quot;Throughout the history of air combat, a few outstanding fighter pilots, typically less than five percent of the whole, have run up large scores at the expense of their less gifted brethren. The numerical imbalance was such that a large number of high scorers was needed. The quest was on to turn each fighter pilot into an ace, and technology seemed the easiest, and the only way to achieve it. This was the idea underlying the first two American superfighters; the F-14 Tomcat and the F-15 Eagle.”

While the technology advantage for heavy fighters that better supported the pilot may well have been a valid point in the 1970s (when the F-14 and F-15 first entered service), this advantage has not been maintained over time. Engine performance improvements have improved load carry capability, and with more compact electronics, the lightweight fighter has, from the 1980s onwards, had similar pilot enhancing technical features. The lightweight fighter carries equally effective weapons including BVR missiles, and has similar combat range and persistence. The modern lightweight fighter achieves these competitive features while still maintaining the classic advantages of better surprise, numbers, and maneuverability. Thus, the lightweight fighter natural advantages have remained in force despite the addition of more technology to air combat.

Due to their lower costs, modern light fighters equip the air forces of many smaller nations. However, as budgets have limits for all nations, the optimum selection of fighter aircraft weight, complexity, and cost is an important strategic issue even for wealthy nations. The budgetary and strategic significance of light fighters is illustrated by the defense investment at stake. As an example where well referenced data is available, though numerous trial and combat references consider the lightweight F-16 to be as good or better on a per plane as the excellent but expensive F-15, fielding and maintaining a light fighter force based on the F-16 is approximately half the cost of the same number of F-15&#x27;s. The US Air Force reports the total loaded cost per hour (as of 2013) of operating the F-16C to be ~US$22,500 per hour, while that of the heavy F-15C is $41,900 per hour. Numerous authoritative sources report that it takes about 200 to 400 flight hours per year to maintain fighter pilot proficiency.

Lanchester&#x27;s laws on military superiority suggest that any technical superiority of the heavy fighter on a unit basis will not always translate to winning wars. For example, late in WWII the greatly superior German Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, flown by the finest pilots Germany had left, many of them very high scoring aces with kill counts far in excess of Allied pilots, in its relatively small numbers suffered heavy losses and was unable to fundamentally alter the air war over Germany. Such issues are relevant to future military planning and deployments.

==History==

===Interwar period===

The light fighter class originally stemmed from concern at the growing size and cost of the frontline fighters in the 1920s. During the late 1920s and 1930s the light fighter would receive significant attention, especially in France.

One early light fighter project was the French Air Force&#x27;s &#x27;Jockey&#x27; interceptor program of 1926. Several aircraft, including the Nieuport-Delage NiD 48 and Amiot 110, were trialed without much success as they offered little over aircraft already in production In the late 1920s the British similarly issued specification F.20/27 for a short-range fast-climbing daylight interceptor. The de Havilland DH.77 and Vickers Jockey monoplanes were among seven designs tendered to meet the specification but neither went into production, the heavier but faster biplane Hawker Fury being preferred.

Despite the failure of their Jockey program, the French returned to lightweight fighters during the 1930s as a means to expand France&#x27;s fleet of aircraft and counter the buildup of the German air force. This focused on light wooden fighters that could be built quickly without affecting production of other aircraft. A mid-thirties specification requiring fixed undercarriage produced two prototypes and in 1936 a revised requirement for retractable gear resulted in three prototypes. The most numerous of the two designs which went into production was the Caudron C.714. Delivery began in early 1940, but less than 100 had been built before the fall of France. Although underpowered, it was of necessity used by Polish air force pilots serving in France.

===WWII===

There was debate before and during World War II about the optimum size, weight and number of engines for fighter aircraft. During the war, fighters in the light to middle-weight range proved to be the most effective. Properly designed with competitive power to weight and thrust to drag ratios, these aircraft out-performed heavy fighters in combat due to greater surprise and maneuverability. They were also more cost effective, allowing greater numbers to be deployed as a combat advantage. Some single-engined fighters (including the P-51 Mustang and A6M Zero) could also match or beat the range of their heavy twin-engined counterparts.

====Germany====

The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 entered service in 1937 as a high speed interceptor and became the most-produced fighter in history, with nearly 34,000 built. The design philosophy of the Bf 109 was to wrap a small airframe around a powerful engine using Messerschmitt&#x27;s &quot;lightweight construction&quot; principle, which aimed to minimize the weight and number of separate parts in the aircraft. By concentrating wing, engine and landing gear weight in the firewall, the structure of the Bf 109 could be made relatively light and simple. The Bf 109 was the second-smallest major fighter aircraft of World War II and the lightest in the European theater. The &quot;E&quot; version used in the Battle of Britain had an empty weight of . The more heavily armed and powerful G version used later in the war had an empty weight of . In comparison, its main fighter opponents weighed .

====Japan====

The lightest major fighter of World War II was the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero naval fighter. Entering service in 1940 and remaining in use throughout the war, it had an empty weight of for the A6M2 version, which was extremely light even by the standards of its time. The design team leader, Jiro Horikoshi, intended it to be as light and agile as possible, embodying the qualities of a samurai sword. With Japanese engine technology lagging behind that of the west, but required to out-perform western fighters, the designers minimised weight to maximize range and maneuverability. This was achieved by methods including the use of light weaponry and the absence of armour and self-sealing fuel tanks. Early in World War II the Zero was considered the most capable carrier-based fighter in the world, and the extremely long range meant that the Zero could appear in and strike locations where Japanese air power was otherwise not expected to reach. In early combat operations, the Zero gained a reputation as an excellent dogfighter, achieving a kill ratio of 12 to 1. However, Japan was unable to keep improving the aircraft through the war, primarily limited by lagging engine technology, and by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better aircraft enabled the Allied pilots to engage the Zero on equal or superior terms. For instance, the larger and heavier Grumman F6F Hellcat had superior performance to the Zero in all aspects other than manoeuvrability. Combined with the US Navy&#x27;s superior training standards, units equipped with the type achieved a large victory-to-loss ratio against the Zero and other Japanese aircraft.

====United Kingdom====

The Royal Air Force entered World War II with two modern single-engined fighters forming the majority of the fighter force of the RAF – the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane. Initially introduced as bomber interceptors, both started with eight machine gun armament but changed to cannons in the course of the war.

The Spitfire, designed by R. J. Mitchell, entered service in 1938 and remained in production throughout the war. The empty weight of the Battle of Britain-era Spitfire IIA was , increasing to in a later variant. It was highly maneuverable and was generally a match for its German opponents. Most Spitfires had a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, but later variants used one of the most powerful engines of the war – the Rolls-Royce Griffon. The Spitfire was produced and improved throughout the war but was complex to build and had limited range. In other respects it was considered an outstanding fighter.

The Hawker Hurricane played an important role in the Battle of Britain, but its performance was inferior to the Spitfire and during the war was removed from frontline duty as a fighter and used for ground attack. Production ceased in mid-1944. The Hurricane IIC weighed empty.

====United States====
 On the eve of the war, the United States Army Air Corps contracted for several &quot;very light&quot; fighter designs based on the Ranger V-770 engine, an air-cooled inverted V12 engine, that delivered up to 700 hp. Two prototypes were the Bell XP-77 (empty weight ) and the Douglas XP-48 (empty weight ). Problems with the engine and performance and a perceived lack of need saw both programs canceled. However, they were specifically defined as &quot;light&quot; or &quot;very light&quot; fighter aircraft.

Instead, the US developed a number of standard pursuit fighters, the most efficient being the relatively lightweight North American P-51 Mustang. The P-51 was more economical, costing less per air-to-air kill than any other American aircraft.

The United States Navy, also made aware of lightweight advantages by combat results, ordered a lighter version of the Grumman F6F Hellcat, which at empty weight had limited maneuverability and rate of climb. The planned Grumman F8F Bearcat replacement used the same engine, but with empty weight reduced to had excellent performance. It entered production too late to see combat in World War II. Postwar, it equipped 24 fighter squadrons in the Navy and a smaller number in the Marines. Navy author James Perry Stevenson called the Bearcat &quot;the quintessential lightweight fighter&quot;.

====USSR====
The Soviet Yakovlev Yak-3, which entered service in 1944, was an attempt to develop the smallest and lightest fighter around the V-12 Klimov M-107 engine. As this engine was not available in time, the Klimov M-105 was substituted, with a resulting empty weight of . Despite the reduced power, the Yak-3 had a top speed of . The Yak-3 could out-turn the German Bf 109 and Fw 190. German pilots were ordered to avoid dogfights with the Yak-3 at low level.

The Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 was also a lightweight fighter, initially using the M-105 engine. With an empty weight , it was among the lighter major fighters of World War II. A development of the Yakovlev Yak-7, it entered combat in late 1942 and was the Soviet Union&#x27;s most-produced fighter with 16,769 built. At low altitudes, the Yak-9 was faster and more maneuverable than the Bf 109. However, its armament of one cannon and one machine gun was relatively light.

===Early jet age===
The Luftwaffe&#x27;s Heinkel He 162 &quot;Volksjäger&quot; of 1945 was a very deliberate attempt at producing a low cost jet fighter without materials that were in short supply at the end of the war. It was a low cost emergency fighter, one of several designs for the Emergency Fighter Program using rockets or jets, which could be built by unskilled labour and would be flown by inexperienced pilots to defend the Third Reich. With an empty weight of , it was very light even for the time. The He 162A was powered by a BMW 003 engine. With a top speed of at normal thrust at sea level, and at , it was about faster than Allied fighters but had no more than 30 minutes fuel. Test pilots reported it to be a fine handling and conceptually well designed aircraft, and considered its problems to be rushed delivery more than any fundamental design flaws. It never formally entered operational service, and did not receive the benefit of being flown by well trained pilots using a well considered operational plan. Only 120 were delivered to units, and it scored only a few kills in experimental use before the war ended.

After World War II fighter design moved into the jet era, and many jet fighters followed the successful World War II formula of highly efficient mostly single-engine designs. Prominent early examples include the British mid-50s Folland Gnat, the American North American F-86 Sabre, Northrop F-5 and the Soviet Mikoyan MiG-15.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 was a Soviet jet fighter developed shortly after World War II. It weighed empty and was one of the first successful jet fighters to use swept wings for high transonic speeds. It first saw service in the Chinese Civil War. In combat during the Korean War, it outclassed straight-winged jet day fighters. Some 18,000 were produced.

The North American F-86 Sabre, a transonic jet fighter manufactured from 1949, was the United States&#x27;s first swept wing fighter. With an empty weight of it was nearly 40 per cent heavier than the MiG-15, but light compared with today&#x27;s fighters. The F-86 had a bubble canopy, small size, moderate cost, high maneuverability, and an armament of six calibre machine guns. It could turn faster than any modern fighter. It saw combat against the Mig 15 in high-speed dogfights during the Korean War. Considered (with the MiG 15) as one of the best fighters in the Korean War, it was the most-produced Western jet fighter, with total production of 9,860 units. It continued as a front-line fighter in numerous air forces until 1994.

The Folland Gnat was a British private venture design for a light fighter and was the product of &quot;Teddy&quot; Petter&#x27;s theories about fighter aircraft design. Although only adopted by the UK as a trainer, the Gnat served successfully as a fighter for the Indian Air Force and was in service from 1959 to 1979. India produced an improved derivative of it, the HAL Ajeet. With an empty weight of it was the lightest successful post-World War II jet fighter, though at the cost of shorter range compared to other fighters. The Gnat is credited as having shot down seven Pakistani F-86s in the 1965 war, for the loss of two Gnats downed by PAF fighters. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Indian Gnats shot down several Pakistani F-86s without loss. The Gnat was successful against the capable F-86 flown by well-trained Pakistani pilots because its smaller size allowed a superior level of surprise and greater agility in dogfighting.

In the early 1950s, the NATO NBMR-1 competition for a cheap &quot;light weight tactical strike fighter&quot; able to carry conventional or tactical nuclear weapons and operate from dispersed airfields with minimum ground support led to designs including the French SNCASE Baroudeur, Breguet Taon and Dassault Étendard VI, the Italian Aeritalia G.91 and Aerfer Ariete. Other competitors included the Northrop F-5A. The British chose to continue production of the Hawker Hunter, while the French decided to work independently of the competition. Italy produced the Fiat G.91 while the competition was underway and, in 1957, this was selected as NATO&#x27;s standard strike fighter. With an empty weight of it was very light for a jet fighter. The G.91 entered service with the Italian Air Force in 1961, with the West German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, in 1962, and later with the Portuguese Air Force. It was in production for 19 years, with production ceasing in 1977 with 756 aircraft built.
In the mid-1950s, it was realized that fighter costs were escalating to possibly unacceptable levels, and some companies sought to reverse the trend to heavier and more expensive fighters. A prominent result was the Mach 1.3 to Mach 1.6, Northrop F-5. Smaller, cheaper and simpler than the contemporary F-4 Phantom, the F-5 had excellent performance and was popular on the export market. It was perhaps the most effective US-produced fighter in the 1960s and early 1970s, with a high sortie rate, low accident rate, high maneuverability, and an effective armament of 20mm cannon and heat-seeking missiles. Though the United States never procured the F-5 for main line service, it did adopt it as an opposing forces (OPFOR) &quot;aggressor&quot; for dissimilar training role because of its small size and similarity in performance to the Soviet MiG-21. It also participated in large scale trials of aircraft and missile effectiveness. In the extensive 9 month long AIMVAL/ACEVAL trial at Nellis AFB in 1977, the F-5 &quot;Red Force&quot; was quite effective against the considerably larger F-14 Tomcat naval fighter and F-15 Eagle single seat fighters making up the &quot;Blue Force&quot;. These modern aircraft are approximately five to ten times more expensive than the various versions of the F-5. The final result was the F-5 fighting the more modern fighters to an effective plane for plane draw. In direct combat against the similar MiG-21 (which performed well against American fighters in Vietnam), the F-5 is known to have scored 13 victories against 4 losses. Just under 1000 of the F-5A Freedom Fighter were sold worldwide, and another 1,400 of the updated F-5E Tiger II version. As of 2016 the F-5 remains in service with many nations, some of which have undertaken extensive upgrade programs to modernize its abilities with digital avionics and radar guided missiles.

The light middleweight Saab 35 Draken was a second to third generation Mach 2 fighter produced from 1955 to 1974 and in service for 45 years, with empty weights from 6,577 kg (14,500) to . It was a double-delta wing single-engine fighter. Its steeply swept inner delta wing allowed for a high cruise speed. The double-delta, with a shallower rake at the outer wing, improved maneuverability. It was designed to be cheap enough for small countries and simple enough to be maintained by conscripted mechanics. Its high acceleration, light wing loading, and extreme maneuverability enabled it to be an excellent dogfighter. However, it had an overly complex fire control system. It remained in service until 2005.

The French Dassault Mirage III is another late 2nd/early 3rd generation delta wing Mach 2 fighter. Stemming from a French requirement for a lightweight all-weather interceptor, it has been in service since 1961. With an empty weight of in the &quot;E&quot; version with added ground attack capability, the Mirage III is a light fighter by modern standards (though twice as heavy as initial Mirage I). Its maneuverability, modest cost, reliability and armament of 30mm cannons and heat seeking missiles proved effective. It served the French Air Force and was exported to many countries. It performed very well for Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967 and Yom Kippur War of 1973. However, Argentina&#x27;s Mirage IIIs were out-performed by British Sea Harriers during the Falklands War of 1982.

Similar in size to the F-5, the Russian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 entered service in 1959, was produced until 1985, and is still in widespread use today. The late Generation 2 to Generation 3, Mach 2 MiG-21 has an empty weight of , and has served nearly 60 nations. It shot down 37 to 104 US Phantoms, in the Vietnam War, with the Phantoms shooting down 54 to 66 MiG-21s in return. In December 1966 the MiG-21 pilots of the 921st FR downed 14 F-105s without any losses. Its weaknesses include poor visibility and relatively short range, but has otherwise proven to be a capable fighter.
The US&#x27;s Vought F-8 Crusader used in Vietnam weighed , as compared with for an F-4 Phantom. It was a simple, supersonic, single engine, gun- and heat-seeker armed fighter in front-line service from 1957 to 1976. It had no radar except a simple ranging gunsite radar. The US claims the Crusader (up to 1968) shot down six enemy aircraft for every loss, compared with 2.4 for every Phantom lost. The three F-8s shot down in air-to-air were all lost to MiG-17 cannon fire.

The first few decades of the jet fighter era showed a combat history similar in general trend to that of the propeller fighters of World War II. So long as lighter fighters are of sufficient power-to-weight ratio and airframe sophistication, and flown by similarly skilled pilots, they tend to dominate over heavier fighters using surprise, numbers, and maneuverability. However, one significant difference did emerge in design strategy in the early jet fighter era. In World War II fighter design was strongly influenced by the seeking of higher speeds that were valuable in combat in order to close with the enemy or to escape. This trend was instinctively continued in some jet fighters through the 3rd generation (F-4 at Mach 2.23) and into the 4th generation (F-14 at Mach 2.35 and F-15 at Mach 2.5+). The aerodynamic requirements to operate at such speeds add considerable complexity, weight, and cost to the airframe. But, these Mach 2 and above class speeds have zero utility in combat. Combat speeds never exceed Mach 1.7 and seldom 1.2, for two reasons. First, it requires extensive use of the afterburner, which typically increases fuel consumption by about a factor of three or even four, and rapidly reduces operational radius. Second, speeds even above about Mach 0.7 to Mach 1 (depending on circumstances) so widen the turn radius in maneuvering combat that the fighter is thrown too wide to get a tracking solution on an opponent. Speed had reached the limit of its practical combat value, such that optimum fighter design required understanding the penalties the endless search for higher speed was imposing, and sometimes deliberately choosing not to accept those penalties.

===Supersonic era===

As supersonic performance, with afterburning engines and modern missile armament, became the norm the Soviet Mikoyan MiG-21, the French Mirage III, and the Swedish Saab Draken entered service. The next generation of lightweight fighters included the American F-16 Fighting Falcon, Swedish JAS 39 Gripen, Indian HAL Tejas, Korean FA-50, Japanese Mitsubishi F-2, Chinese Chengdu J-10 and Pakistani CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder. The high practical and budgetary effectiveness of modern light fighters for many missions is why the US Air Force adopted both the F-15 Eagle and F-16 in a &quot;hi/lo&quot; strategy of both an outstanding but expensive heavy fighter and a lower cost but also outstanding lightweight fighter. The investment to maintain a competitive modern lightweight fighter air force is approximately $90M to $130M (2013 dollars) per plane over a 20-year service life, which is approximately half the cost of heavy fighters so understanding fighter aircraft design trade-offs and combat effectiveness is of national level strategic importance.

In the 1960s and 1970s, a US-based &quot;Fighter Mafia&quot;, led by colonels John Boyd, Everest &quot;Rich&quot; Riccione and analyst Pierre Sprey advocated for production of a 4th generation light fighter. Despite heavy fighter losses in the Vietnam War, most senior US Air Force leaders still opposed the light fighter concept. After much debate, General Dynamics designed the successful F-16. Its competitor, the Northrop YF-17, led to the successful McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet Navy fighter as a cheaper alternative to the F-14. The F-16 offered excellent air-to-air combat performance due partly to its fly-by-wire control system, which improved agility. When not burdened by heavy air-to-ground weapons, the F-16 had the longest range of any US fighter at the time. The F-16 and F/A-18 later added significant weight to become multirole fighters with strong air-to-ground capabilities, pushing them towards the &quot;middleweight&quot; range of modern fighters.

The Soviet counterpart to the F-16 and F/A-18, the Mikoyan MiG-29, was originally part of the &quot;Perspektivnyy Lyogkiy Frontovoy Istrebitel&quot; (LPFI, or &quot;Advanced Lightweight Tactical Fighter&quot;) program.
In the 1980s the privately developed F-5G, later renamed the Northrop F-20 Tigershark, aimed to correct weaknesses in the aging F-5 while maintaining small size and low cost. Its empty weight was . Its General Electric F404 engine produced 60 percent more power than the F-5, and it had a higher climb rate and acceleration, better cockpit visibility, and more modern radar. Chuck Yeager, test pilot and the first man to break the sound barrier, referred to the F-20 as &quot;the finest fighter&quot; of the mid-1980s. Despite its high performance and cost effectiveness, the F-20 lost out for foreign sales against the similarly capable, more expensive F-16, which was being procured in large numbers by the US Air Force and was viewed as having greater support. The Tigershark was cancelled having made no sales.

The HAL Tejas has an empty weight of , and is the lightest fighter among current production light fighters. Introduced into limited service in 2014, with 16 IOC specification aircraft delivered to January 2020, it was the lowest-cost fighter aircraft with competitive air-to-air capability in production at that time, at an equivalent cost of US$27 million. 83 Tejas MK1As are ordered, with another 100 planned, making it the lightest 4.5 generation aircraft in production. The design is similar to the Mirage III and JAS 39 Gripen, being a light tailless delta-wing single-engine fighter with ground attack capability.

The French Dassault Mirage 2000 was designed for the French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;) in the late 1970s, as a lightweight single-engine fighter. Based on the Mirage III, it entered service in 1982, and has since evolved into a multirole aircraft. In heavier multirole form, it has empty weight of . More than 600 were built and it has served in the air forces of nine nations.

South Korea&#x27;s KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, designed by Lockheed Martin with Korea Aerospace Industries, is based on the F-16 multirole-fighter. Its latest variant, the FA-50 Fighting Eagle, is designated as a light fighter and trainer. It uses the same air frame as the T-50 advanced trainer introduced in August 2002. It is now deployed with South Korean Air Force and the Philippine Air Force.

The CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder light fighter was developed jointly by China&#x27;s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and Pakistan&#x27;s Pakistan Aeronautical Complex in the early 2000s. it was inducted into the Pakistan Air Force in February 2010. At least 66 aircraft have been delivered to Pakistan. More aircraft are scheduled to be introduced in 2018. A twin-seater variant was undergoing flight testing as of late 2015.
The JAS 39 Gripen is a single-engine light fighter manufactured by the Swedish aerospace company Saab. With an empty weight of it is the second lightest fighter in production as of 2016. Though primarily an air superiority fighter, the design has effective air-to- ground capability as well. Its delta wing offers high cruise and super-cruise (above Mach 1 without using after-burner), low wing-loading and high maneuverability. It can operate from short airstrips and sections of road, can be serviced by moderately trained mechanics, and has high sortie rates. Among Western 4th generation fighters the Gripen has the lowest operating cost at about $4,700 per flight hour (as of 2012). The lowest operating cost in current range of fighters discussed above is of HAL Tejas of about $4,000. Among western fighters, next best operating cost fighter is the F-16 at about $7,000 per flight hour. The Gripen has relaxed stability fly-by-wire flight controls for maximum agility, a top speed of Mach 2, a 27mm cannon, heat-seeking missiles, and radar-guided missiles.
==Current trends==
The issue of where a fighter is best positioned on the weight, cost, and complexity curve is still a contentious issue. Stealth technology (airframe and engine design that strongly reduce radar and heat signatures) seeks to emphasize the most important feature of fighter effectiveness, the element of surprise. So far it has been featured only on heavier and more expensive fighters, specifically the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. These fighters are not only stealthy, but also have information or combat awareness advantages due to active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, and data linking for external cuing of enemy position and friendly force status. Their combination of near invisibility to conventional radars, superior combat awareness, networking, and reliable Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles, enables them to get deep inside the enemy&#x27;s OODA loop and destroy enemy fighters before their pilots are even aware of the threat.

Fighter drones (see Unmanned combat aerial vehicle) are under development, driven by the same tactical and cost effectiveness principles of light fighters. Their perceived advantages include not only cost and numbers, but the fact that their software based &quot;pilot&quot; does not require years of training, is always at the same peak effectiveness for each aircraft (unlike the human pilot case where the top 5% of pilots have historically scored about 50% of all kills), is not physiologically limited, and does not have a life to lose if the aircraft is lost in combat. Though there is cultural resistance to replacement of human fighter pilots and also concerns about entrusting life and death decisions to robot software, such fighter drones are expected to eventually be implemented.

<doc id="527046" wikidata="Q1413102" url="?curid=527046" title="Hyperfine structure">
<text>In atomic physics, hyperfine structure is defined by small shifts in otherwise degenerate electronic energy levels and the resulting splittings in those electronic energy levels of atoms, molecules, and ions, due to electromagnetic multipole interaction between the nucleus and electron clouds.

In atoms, hyperfine structure arises from the energy of the nuclear magnetic dipole moment interacting with the magnetic field generated by the electrons and the energy of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment in the electric field gradient due to the distribution of charge within the atom. Molecular hyperfine structure is generally dominated by these two effects, but also includes the energy associated with the interaction between the magnetic moments associated with different magnetic nuclei in a molecule, as well as between the nuclear magnetic moments and the magnetic field generated by the rotation of the molecule.

Hyperfine structure contrasts with &quot;fine structure&quot;, which results from the interaction between the magnetic moments associated with electron spin and the electrons&#x27; orbital angular momentum. Hyperfine structure, with energy shifts typically orders of magnitudes smaller than those of a fine-structure shift, results from the interactions of the nucleus (or nuclei, in molecules) with internally generated electric and magnetic fields.

==History==
The first theory of atomic hyperfine structure was given in 1930 by Enrico Fermi for an atom containing a single valence electron with an arbitrary angular momentum. The Zeeman splitting of this structure was discussed by S. A. Goudsmit and R. F. Bacher later that year.

In 1935, H. Schüler and Theodor Schmidt proposed the existence of a nuclear quadrupole moment in order to explain anomalies in the hyperfine structure of Europium, Cassiopium (older name for Lutetium), Indium, Antimony, and Mercury.

==Theory==
The theory of hyperfine structure comes directly from electromagnetism, consisting of the interaction of the nuclear multipole moments (excluding the electric monopole) with internally generated fields. The theory is derived first for the atomic case, but can be applied to &quot;each nucleus&quot; in a molecule. Following this there is a discussion of the additional effects unique to the molecular case.

===Atomic hyperfine structure===

====Magnetic dipole====
The dominant term in the hyperfine Hamiltonian is typically the magnetic dipole term. Atomic nuclei with a non-zero nuclear spin formula_1 have a magnetic dipole moment, given by:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the &quot;g&quot;-factor and formula_4 is the nuclear magneton.

There is an energy associated with a magnetic dipole moment in the presence of a magnetic field. For a nuclear magnetic dipole moment, μI, placed in a magnetic field, B, the relevant term in the Hamiltonian is given by:
formula_5

In the absence of an externally applied field, the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus is that associated with the orbital (ℓ) and spin (s) angular momentum of the electrons:
formula_6

=====Electron orbital magnetic field=====
Electron orbital angular momentum results from the motion of the electron about some fixed external point that we shall take to be the location of the nucleus. The magnetic field at the nucleus due to the motion of a single electron, with charge –&quot;e&quot; at a position r relative to the nucleus, is given by:
formula_7
where −r gives the position of the nucleus relative to the electron. Written in terms of the Bohr magneton, this gives:
formula_8

Recognizing that &quot;m&quot;ev is the electron momentum, p, and that is the orbital angular momentum in units of &quot;ħ&quot;, ℓ, we can write:
formula_9

For a many-electron atom this expression is generally written in terms of the total orbital angular momentum, formula_10, by summing over the electrons and using the projection operator, formula_11, where formula_12. For states with a well defined projection of the orbital angular momentum, , we can write formula_13, giving:
formula_14

=====Electron spin magnetic field=====
The electron spin angular momentum is a fundamentally different property that is intrinsic to the particle and therefore does not depend on the motion of the electron. Nonetheless, it is angular momentum and any angular momentum associated with a charged particle results in a magnetic dipole moment, which is the source of a magnetic field. An electron with spin angular momentum, s, has a magnetic moment, μ&quot;s&quot;, given by:
formula_15
where &quot;gs&quot; is the electron spin &quot;g&quot;-factor and the negative sign is because the electron is negatively charged (consider that negatively and positively charged particles with identical mass, travelling on equivalent paths, would have the same angular momentum, but would result in currents in the opposite direction).

The magnetic field of a point dipole moment, μs, is given by:
formula_16

=====Electron total magnetic field and contribution=====
The complete magnetic dipole contribution to the hyperfine Hamiltonian is thus given by:
formula_17

The first term gives the energy of the nuclear dipole in the field due to the electronic orbital angular momentum. The second term gives the energy of the &quot;finite distance&quot; interaction of the nuclear dipole with the field due to the electron spin magnetic moments. The final term, often known as the &quot;Fermi contact&quot; term relates to the direct interaction of the nuclear dipole with the spin dipoles and is only non-zero for states with a finite electron spin density at the position of the nucleus (those with unpaired electrons in &quot;s&quot;-subshells). It has been argued that one may get a different expression when taking into account the detailed nuclear magnetic moment distribution. The inclusion of the delta function is an admission that the singularity in the magnetic induction B owing to a magnetic dipole moment at a point is not integrable. It is B which mediates the interaction between the Pauli spinors in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Fermi (1930) avoided the difficulty by working with the relativistic Dirac wave equation, according to which the mediating field for the Dirac spinors is the four-vector potential (V,A). The component  V is the Coulomb potential. The component A is the three-vector magnetic potential (such that B = curl A), which for the point dipole is integrable. 

For states with formula_18 this can be expressed in the form
formula_19
where:
formula_20

If hyperfine structure is small compared with the fine structure (sometimes called &quot;IJ&quot;-coupling by analogy with &quot;LS&quot;-coupling), &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are good quantum numbers and matrix elements of formula_21 can be approximated as diagonal in &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot;. In this case (generally true for light elements), we can project N onto J (where is the total electronic angular momentum) and we have:
formula_22

This is commonly written as
formula_23
with formula_24 being the hyperfine-structure constant which is determined by experiment. Since (where is the total angular momentum), this gives an energy of:
formula_25

In this case the hyperfine interaction satisfies the Landé interval rule.

====Electric quadrupole====

Atomic nuclei with spin formula_26 have an electric quadrupole moment. In the general case this is represented by a rank-2 tensor, formula_27, with components given by:
formula_28
where &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are the tensor indices running from 1 to 3, &quot;xi&quot; and &quot;xj&quot; are the spatial variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; depending on the values of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; respectively, &quot;δ&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the Kronecker delta and &quot;ρ&quot;(r) is the charge density. Being a 3-dimensional rank-2 tensor, the quadrupole moment has 32 = 9 components. From the definition of the components it is clear that the quadrupole tensor is a symmetric matrix () that is also traceless (formula_29), giving only five components in the irreducible representation. Expressed using the notation of irreducible spherical tensors we have:
formula_30

The energy associated with an electric quadrupole moment in an electric field depends not on the field strength, but on the electric field gradient, confusingly labelled formula_31, another rank-2 tensor given by the outer product of the del operator with the electric field vector:
formula_32
with components given by:
formula_33

Again it is clear this is a symmetric matrix and, because the source of the electric field at the nucleus is a charge distribution entirely outside the nucleus, this can be expressed as a 5-component spherical tensor, formula_34, with:
formula_35
where:
formula_36

The quadrupolar term in the Hamiltonian is thus given by:
formula_37

A typical atomic nucleus closely approximates cylindrical symmetry and therefore all off-diagonal elements are close to zero. For this reason the nuclear electric quadrupole moment is often represented by .

===Molecular hyperfine structure===
The molecular hyperfine Hamiltonian includes those terms already derived for the atomic case with a magnetic dipole term for each nucleus with formula_38 and an electric quadrupole term for each nucleus with formula_39. The magnetic dipole terms were first derived for diatomic molecules by Frosch and Foley, and the resulting hyperfine parameters are often called the Frosch and Foley parameters.

In addition to the effects described above, there are a number of effects specific to the molecular case.

====Direct nuclear spin–spin====
Each nucleus with formula_38 has a non-zero magnetic moment that is both the source of a magnetic field and has an associated energy due to the presence of the combined field of all of the other nuclear magnetic moments. A summation over each magnetic moment dotted with the field due to each &quot;other&quot; magnetic moment gives the direct nuclear spin–spin term in the hyperfine Hamiltonian, formula_41.
formula_42
where &quot;α&quot; and &quot;α″&quot; are indices representing the nucleus contributing to the energy and the nucleus that is the source of the field respectively. Substituting in the expressions for the dipole moment in terms of the nuclear angular momentum and the magnetic field of a dipole, both given above, we have
formula_43

====Nuclear spin–rotation====
The nuclear magnetic moments in a molecule exist in a magnetic field due to the angular momentum, T (R is the internuclear displacement vector), associated with the bulk rotation of the molecule, thus
formula_44

====Small molecule hyperfine structure====
A typical simple example of the hyperfine structure due to the interactions discussed above is in the rotational transitions of hydrogen cyanide (1H12C14N) in its ground vibrational state. Here, the electric quadrupole interaction is due to the 14N-nucleus, the hyperfine nuclear spin-spin splitting is from the magnetic coupling between nitrogen, 14N (&quot;I&quot;N = 1), and hydrogen, 1H (&quot;I&quot;H = ), and a hydrogen spin-rotation interaction due to the 1H-nucleus. These contributing interactions to the hyperfine structure in the molecule are listed here in descending order of influence. Sub-doppler techniques have been used to discern the hyperfine structure in HCN rotational transitions.

The dipole selection rules for HCN hyperfine structure transitions are formula_45, formula_46, where is the rotational quantum number and is the total rotational quantum number inclusive of nuclear spin (formula_47), respectively. The lowest transition (formula_48) splits into a hyperfine triplet. Using the selection rules, the hyperfine pattern of formula_49 transition and higher dipole transitions is in the form of a hyperfine sextet. However, one of these components (formula_50) carries only 0.6% of the rotational transition intensity in the case of formula_49. This contribution drops for increasing J. So, from formula_49 upwards the hyperfine pattern consists of three very closely spaced stronger hyperfine components (formula_45, formula_54) together with two widely spaced components; one on the low frequency side and one on the high frequency side relative to the central hyperfine triplet. Each of these outliers carry ~formula_55 ( is the upper rotational quantum number of the allowed dipole transition) the intensity of the entire transition. For consecutively higher- transitions, there are small but significant changes in the relative intensities and positions of each individual hyperfine component.

==Measurements and Applications==

Hyperfine interactions can be measured, among other ways, in atomic and molecular spectra, and in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of free radicals and transition-metal ions. 

===Astrophysics===

As the hyperfine splitting is very small, the transition frequencies are usually not located in the optical, but are in the range of radio- or microwave (also called sub-millimeter) frequencies.

Hyperfine structure gives the 21 cm line observed in H I regions in interstellar medium.

Carl Sagan and Frank Drake considered the hyperfine transition of hydrogen to be a sufficiently universal phenomenon so as to be used as a base unit of time and length on the Pioneer plaque and later Voyager Golden Record.

In submillimeter astronomy, heterodyne receivers are widely used in detecting electromagnetic signals from celestial objects such as star-forming core or young stellar objects. The separations among neighboring components in a hyperfine spectrum of an observed rotational transition are usually small enough to fit within the receiver&#x27;s IF band. Since the optical depth varies with frequency, strength ratios among the hyperfine components differ from that of their intrinsic (or &quot;optically thin&quot;) intensities (these are so-called &quot;hyperfine anomalies&quot;, often observed in the rotational transitions of HCN). Thus, a more accurate determination of the optical depth is possible. From this we can derive the object&#x27;s physical parameters.

===Nuclear spectroscopy===

In nuclear spectroscopy methods, the nucleus is used to probe the local structure in materials. The methods mainly base on hyperfine interactions with the surrounding atoms and ions. Important methods are nuclear magnetic resonance, Mössbauer spectroscopy, perturbed angular correlation, and high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering.

===Nuclear technology===
The atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) process uses the hyperfine splitting between optical transitions in uranium-235 and uranium-238 to selectively photo-ionize only the uranium-235 atoms and then separate the ionized particles from the non-ionized ones. Precisely tuned dye lasers are used as the sources of the necessary exact wavelength radiation.

===Use in defining the SI second and meter===
The hyperfine structure transition can be used to make a microwave notch filter with very high stability, repeatability and Q factor, which can thus be used as a basis for very precise atomic clocks. The term &quot;transition frequency&quot; denotes the frequency of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the atom, and is equal to , where is difference in energy between the levels and is the Planck constant. Typically, the transition frequency of a particular isotope of caesium or rubidium atoms is used as a basis for these clocks.

Due to the accuracy of hyperfine structure transition-based atomic clocks, they are now used as the basis for the definition of the second. One second is now &quot;defined&quot; to be exactly cycles of the hyperfine structure transition frequency of caesium-133 atoms.

On October 21, 1983, the 17th CGPM defined the meter as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of of a second.

===Precision tests of quantum electrodynamics===
The hyperfine splitting in hydrogen and in muonium have been used to measure the value of the fine-structure constant α. Comparison with measurements of α in other physical systems provides a stringent test of QED.

===Qubit in ion-trap quantum computing===
The hyperfine states of a trapped ion are commonly used for storing qubits in ion-trap quantum computing. They have the advantage of having very long lifetimes, experimentally exceeding ~10 minutes (compared to ~1s for metastable electronic levels).

The frequency associated with the states&#x27; energy separation is in the microwave region, making it possible to drive hyperfine transitions using microwave radiation. However, at present no emitter is available that can be focused to address a particular ion from a sequence. Instead, a pair of laser pulses can be used to drive the transition, by having their frequency difference (&quot;detuning&quot;) equal to the required transition&#x27;s frequency. This is essentially a stimulated Raman transition. In addition, near-field gradients have been exploited to individually address two ions separated by approximately 4.3 micrometers directly with microwave radiation.

Studies of Native American tribal names show that most had an original meaning comparable to &quot;human,&quot; &quot;people&quot; &quot;us&quot;—the &quot;tribal&quot; name for itself was often the localized ethnic self-perception of the general word for &quot;human being.&quot;

In Israel, tribal names are used by the central election committee instead of town names, in cases where tribes do not live in recognized towns, or are nomadic.

<text>The prime minister of Spain is the head of government of Spain. There is no specific date as to when the office of Prime Minister first appeared as the role was not created, but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties. Modern historians have not managed to agree who the first prime minister of Spain was, but Francisco Martínez de la Rosa was the first prime minister recognized by a constitutional law (the Spanish Royal Statute of 1834).

In contemporary Spain, the first Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain since the approval of the Constitution was Adolfo Suárez. Due to the gradual evolution of the post, the title has been applied to early prime ministers retroactively. The following list therefore includes those who have been referred to as various other titles since the creation of the Council of Ministers in 1823.

Since the reign of Philip V, prime ministers have received several names, such as First Secretary of State (until 1834), President of the Council of Ministers (1834–1868; 1874–1923; 1925–1939), President of the Executive Power (1874) or President of the Government (1973–present), among others. Between 1938 and 1973, the post of President of the Government was personally linked to the person serving as Head of State.

==Before 1823==

There is no specific date when the office of prime minister first appeared as the role was not created, but rather evolved over a period of time through merger of duties. The government was led by a &quot;Valido&quot;, a favourite of the Monarch or the ruling Regent. Since 1621, there was also a Secretary of State of the Universal Bureau (&quot;Secretario de Estado y del Despacho Universal&quot;), but this seems to have been rather a subordinate position.

Later, the reforms introduced by Phillip V in the 1710s established several secretaries of state for specific government areas, and the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (&quot;Secretario de Estado y del Despacho de Estado&quot;) was eventually known as the First Secretary of State due to its &quot;de facto&quot; role as primer minister. This position was consolidated with the establishment of the Council of Ministers in 1823 which the First Secretary of State chaired over in the king&#x27;s absence, and in 1834 the First Secretary of State became known as President of the Council of Ministers.

<text>RFA &quot;Bayleaf&quot; (A79) was a Leaf-class support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and the second ship to bear the name.

&quot;Bayleaf&quot; was launched by the Furness Shipbuilding Company of Stockton-on-Tees. She was launched as the civilian &quot;London Integrity&quot; for London &amp; Overseas Freighters in 1954 and completed in 1955. She was a sister ship of RFA &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; (A81) built by the same shipyard for LOF the previous year.

She was bareboat chartered for the RFA in 1959 and renamed RFA &quot;Bayleaf&quot;. She was returned to her owners in 1973, with whom she traded as the &quot;London Integrity&quot; again until the end of 1976.

On 7 January 1977 she was sold for scrap and on 25 January 1977 she arrived in Burriana in Spain to be broken up.

<text>RFA &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; (A81) was a support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom. Originally built as MV &quot;Hudson Deep&quot; she was chartered by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 1980.

==Operational history==
In April 1982, &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; was diverted from Armilla patrol duties in the Persian Gulf for service during the Falklands Conflict. Due to damage sustained due to severe weather, &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; transferred her cargo to off South Georgia and returned to the UK for repairs during May prior to returning to the South Atlantic in June, and again in August.

On 18 November 1983, &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; sailed along with the assault ship HMS Fearless to support Operation Offcut, providing naval support for British troops in the multi-national force in Lebanon.

In 2003, &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; was one of 13 RFA ships deployed in support of the second Gulf War.

On 18 August 2009 she was towed to Ghent for scrapping.

== Battle honours ==

On 29 August 1984 &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; received her Falklands Islands 1982 Battle honour, presented by Mr A. Kemp, Director Ships and Fuel (DST (SF)).

<text>Walter Stanley Monroe (May 14, 1871 – October 6, 1952) was a businessman and conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of Newfoundland from 1924 to 1928 as leader of the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party.

He was born in Ireland in 1871, the first son of John Monroe, a distinguished lawyer who became Solicitor-General for Ireland, and his wife Elizabeth Moule. He was educated at the Harrow School, England. He emigrated to Newfoundland to join his uncle, Moses Monroe, at the age of 17 in 1888.

Monroe was a successful businessman who briefly served in the government of William Warren. He emerged from the political crisis that destroyed the governments of Sir Richard Squires and William Warren as leader of a new party, the &quot;Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party&quot;, which had been cobbled together by Warren and the opposition Conservatives after Warren&#x27;s government fell. The party was essentially a conservative party and swept to power in the 1924 election, weeks after it was formed.

The Monroe government saw a successful settlement of the Labrador boundary dispute with Canada after Newfoundland successfully argued its case at the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. As prime minister, one of his first moves in power was to abolish the personal income tax, and to reduce corporate taxes paid by banks. His government introduced a franchise bill to the legislature in 1925, where it passed unanimously on March 9, and became law on April 13, 1925. Now, women were allowed to vote in elections for the first time. Monroe returned to private life and resigned on August 15, 1928 passing the leadership of the party to his cousin Frederick C. Alderdice who became the new prime minister. In 1929, Mr. Monroe was made a member of the Legislative Council of Newfoundland.

<text>RFA &quot;Cherryleaf&quot; (A82) was a Leaf-class small fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom, in service from 1973 to 1980.

==History==
She was built by Nordseewerke in Emden, Germany and launched in 1962 as Overseas Adventurer for London and Overseas Bulk Carriers, a subsidiary of London &amp; Overseas Freighters (LOF). She was bareboat chartered for the RFA in February 1973 and renamed RFA &quot;Cherryleaf&quot;.

In 1980 she was returned to LOF and her name reverted to &quot;Overseas Adventurer&quot;. In 1981 LOF sold her to Petrostar Co Ltd of Saudi Arabia who renamed her Petrostar XVI.

On 5 April 1986 during the Tanker War phase of the Iran–Iraq War she was off Halul Island &quot;en route&quot; from Bahrain to Sharjah when Iranian helicopters hit her with AGM-65 Maverick missiles. Her accommodation was gutted by fire and four crewmembers were killed. She was towed to Sharjah where she was declared a constructive total loss on 9 April 1986 and laid up for disposal. She was sold to National Ship Demolition Co Ltd of Taiwan, arrived Kaohsiung on 24 January 1987 and her demolition began on 19 February 1987.

The ship had the capability to supply fuel and other liquid cargo to vessels using four pairs of replenishment rigs which were located between the forward and aft superstructures. She was able to carry four types of fuels: Furnace Fuel Oil, Diesel, Avcat and Mogas. Limited supplies of lubricating oils, fresh water and dry stores could also be carried. She could operate Westland Wessex or Westland Sea King helicopters, or other helicopters of similar size, from a hangar and flight deck at the stern.

==Operational history==

In August 1965 she took part in the Fleet Review in the Firth of Clyde along with RFA&#x27;s , , and and she then deployed to HMNB Devonport and was present at Plymouth Navy Days 1965, as RFA &quot;Olynthus&quot;.

She operated with 2 Westland Sea King HAS.6 anti-submarine warfare helicopters, of 820 Naval Air Squadron.

== Decommissioning ==

In 1999 &quot;Olwen&quot; was wthdrawn from service and laid up at Portsmouth and on 19 September 2000 she was handed over for disposal; purchased by the Eckhardt Organisation, Germany, for scrap. Then in January 2001 she was renamed &quot;Kea&quot; for the move to the breakers. In May it came to light that she had been banned from Turkish yards due to a high asbestos content. She was diverted to Greece and later sailed via the Suez Canal to Alang Ship Breaking Yard in India, arriving on 21 July 2001.

<text>RFA &quot;Olna&quot; (A123) was the third and final of the three &quot;fast fleet tanker&quot; of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom. When she entered service she was one of the largest and fastest ships in the RFA Fleet. &quot;Olna&quot; saw service in the Falklands War and the Gulf War.

Her design was a development of the later &quot;Tide&quot;-class ships of the early 1960s. She was entered service in 1966 and served in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary for 34 years. &quot;Olna&quot; was the third ship to bear the name.

== Design and description ==

&quot;Olna&quot; had a normal complement consisting 88 Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel with provision for 40 Royal Navy personnel and she was armed with two 20 mm guns and two Corvus chaff launchers. She was designed to achieve a speed of with a fully loaded displacement of .

The ship had the capability to supply fuel and other liquid cargo to vessels using four pairs of replenishment rigs which were located between the forward and aft superstructures. She was able to carry four types of fuels: Furnace Fuel Oil, Diesel, Avcat and Mogas. Limited supplies of lubricating oils, fresh water and dry stores could also be carried. She could operate Westland Wessex or Westland Sea King helicopters, or other helicopters of similar size, from a hangar and flight deck at the stern.

==Operational history==
&quot;Olna&quot; entered service as the UK was pulling back from its final large imperial garrisons. Much of the ship&#x27;s early life was spent supporting routine deployments around the world.

On 19 June 1966, &quot;Olna&quot; rescued 26 survivors from the Greek liberty ship the SS &quot;Zaneta&quot;, which had sunk in the Arabian Sea. On 27 August she deployed to HMNB Devonport and was present at Plymouth Navy Days 1966.

From 20 September until 13 October 1968, &quot;Olna&quot; was deployed participating in Exercise Coral Sands which took place in the Solomon Sea, the Coral Sea and Shoalwater Bay, together with RFAs , and , alongside the Royal Navy’s , , , , and , the Royal Australian Navy’s , and , and the Royal New Zealand Navy’s .

On 19 May 1971 she was involved in a collision with &quot;Regent&quot;, which occurred during a replenishment at sea (RAS), off Portland. A hole was discovered once the RAS was completed which was serious enough for &quot;Olna&quot; to be ordered to discharge and tank clean in Portsmouth. She then sailed to Southampton for emergency dry dock, returning later to anchor off Portland. The following day the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) flotilla left HMNB Portland. Hovering above the ships a Fleet Air Arm Westland Wessex HAS.1 helicopter, XM875, which was carrying five press photographers, lost power and ditched. Three photographers were killed in the incident.

In July 1974 &quot;Olna&quot; was part of the Task Force including: the with, No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, and RFA’s , and , she stood by in Akritori Bay, off Cyprus, supporting evacuations, following a Greek junta-sponsored Cypriot coup d&#x27;état attempt and the subsequent Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

On 17 September 1974 along with RFA’s and she sailed as part of Task Group 317.2 for a Far East deployment, led by the Royal Navy’s helicopter cruiser with the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates , and the lead ship , along with the s and . Between 14 and 21 October the Task Group visited the South African Navy’s base at Simon’s Town, near Cape Town, en route. On 10 and 11 March 1975 &quot;Olna&quot; was deployed to provide humanitarian aid, under Operation Faldage, she stood by off Kompong Som, Cambodia along with the helicopter cruiser &quot;Blake&quot; to evacuate British nationals.

In February 1982 &quot;Olna&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf along with the Type 42 destroyer, , and the lead ship of her class, the frigate . Embarked in &quot;Olna&quot; was Westland Wessex HU.5 helicopter, XS507 of 772 Naval Air Squadron (coded 314 ON), named &quot;buzby&quot;. The vessel needed to return to the UK to clean contaminated fuel tanks and on route she anchored off Gibraltar to wait for the converted hospital ship for Operation Corporate, . &quot;Olna&quot; undertook refuelling at sea trials with &quot;Uganda&quot; and Westland Wessex HU.5 helicopter, XS507 carried out the first deck landing. &quot;Uganda&quot; then sailed to the South Atlantic and &quot;Olna&quot; returned to the UK, arriving during April.

===Falklands War===
In 1982 &quot;Olna&quot; left for the South Atlantic as part of the second wave of ships to leave the UK during the Falklands War. That group was centred on the destroyer HMS &quot;Bristol&quot;. Once &quot;Olna&quot; reached theatre, her time was primarily spent fuelling the carrier battle group.
===1983-2000===
In 1990, another wartime deployment beckoned. As forces built up in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Olna&quot; joined the British task force on station. &quot;Olna&quot; arrived in August 1990, shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and apart from a short maintenance period in Singapore was on station for the whole duration of the conflict. &quot;Olna&quot; operated further north than any other tanker as the US Navy was wary of mines after two ships had been severely damaged.

At the end of the 1990s, retirement was in sight. 1999 and 2000 were spent in mothballs at Gibraltar until the outbreak of a crisis in Sierra Leone called for &quot;Olna&quot; to make one last deployment. The ship did not proceed to Sierra Leone, but instead relieved other RFA vessels of participation in a major exercise off Scotland. Following this exercise, the ship returned to reserve and decommissioned soon thereafter.

== Decommissioning ==

In February 2001 &quot;Olna&quot; was sold to Eckhardt Organisation, for scrap and on 9 March she was towed out from Portsmouth. However, in May it was revealed she had been banned from Turkish yards owing to the high quantity of asbestos aboard and was diverted to Greece. She was renamed &quot;Kos&quot; and sailed via the Suez Canal, arriving at Alang Ship Breaking Yard, India, on 20 June 2001.

== Battle honours ==

On 11 January 1985, RFA &quot;Olna&quot; was awarded her Falkland Islands 1982 Battle Honour, by Rear Admiral John C. Worsop, , RN, – Flag Officer, Portsmouth.

There are dated photographs that show that the airfield was already in use for flying training by Royal Naval pilots in the summer of 1917, although no documents supporting this have ever been found. The photographs show contemporary hangars, sheds and aircraft already in place around grassed runways and uniformed Royal Naval trainee pilots from the HMS Daedalus facility at Cranwell receiving instruction. What is on record is the minutes of a conference held at the Scopwick airfield in November 1917 that confirmed its suitability for conversion to a training depot station in its own right. On 12 January 1918 the War Office issued the authority notice for the site to be formally taken over under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.

Early accommodation for personnel was under canvas and the first pilots arrived on 28 March 1918, commanded by Major John H D’Albiac a former Royal Marines aviator. The party left Royal Flying Corps Portholme Meadow aerodrome in Huntingdonshire and moved to Scopwick, bringing Handley Page bombers with them. RAF Scopwick aerodrome was deemed officially open with their arrival, although the newly established Royal Air Force did not formally come into existence until four days later on 1 April 1918. D’Albiac was appointed as RAF Scopwick&#x27;s first commanding officer. A works report dated November 1918 shows that all building works had been completed. Designated as No. 59 Training Depot Station RAF, its initial establishment of 10 x Handley Page 0/100s, 18 x FE2EB/DS and 30 x Avro 504Ks indicates that it was a night bomber training unit. The only action seen by RAF Scopwick during World War I was when a German Zeppelin attempted a bombing raid, with its bombs missing the station and falling in a nearby field.

===Between the wars===
In April 1920 No. 59 TDS handed over to No. 3 Flying Training School RAF whose first commander was Squadron Leader A T Harris, later to become known as Air Marshal &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Harris. Five months later the name of the station changed from Scopwick to RAF Digby, after several instances of aircraft spares being delivered in error to RAF Shotwick in North Wales. The role of the station also switched from training bomber pilots to training fighter pilots. In April 1922 the school was disbanded and the station placed on care and maintenance, when the RAF contracted further after the end of the war.

The closure was short-lived and in June 1924 No. 2 Flying Training School RAF arrived from RAF Duxford. The school flew Avro 504s, Bristol Fighters, and Sopwith Snipes and specialised in training novice pilots to fly in fighter-type aircraft, rather than the usual practice of learning on basic trainers and later converting to fighters. The school was commanded by Wing Commander Sidney &#x27;Crasher&#x27; Smith DSO AFC, so named because of his habit of landing his aircraft rather more robustly than they were designed for; including three aircraft in a single day. Smith returned to Digby five years later as a Group Captain, for a second stint as station commander. Smith&#x27;s replacement as station commander was an officer due for greater things, Wing Commander Arthur Tedder later became Lord Tedder and Marshal of the Royal Air Force. In 1934 the station was commanded by Group Captain T Leigh-Mallory, who was later to become Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory and one of the most notable commanders in Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain.

Between 1929 and 1936 the appearance of the station changed dramatically and most of the original wooden 1917/1918 hangars, barrack blocks and offices were demolished and replaced with substantial brick structures. The seven original hangars were replaced by two new ones, although a planned third hangar was first delayed and eventually never built. Most of the domestic barrack blocks, officers&#x27; mess, station headquarters, squadron offices and married quarters built at this time still stand and remain in use. The No. 12 Group RAF Lima Sector Operations bunker, now the station museum, was constructed at a cost in 1936 of £5,000.

The following year saw a major change to the station&#x27;s function. On 7 September 1937 No. 2 Flying Training School relocated to RAF Brize Norton, and Digby was handed to No. 12 Group Fighter Command as an operational fighter station intended to provide fighter cover for the cities of Lincoln, Nottingham and Leicester. Two months later there were already two squadrons of fighters at Digby, No. 73 Squadron RAF flying Gloster Gladiators and No. 46 Squadron RAF equipped with Gloster Gauntlets. In 1938 both squadrons were re-equipped with Hawker Hurricanes and joined by another Hurricane squadron No. 504 Squadron RAF, an auxiliary squadron from Nottingham.

===Second World War===
RAF Digby entered the war with some of its squadrons operating from nearby satellite fields under its control at RAF Coleby Grange and RAF Wellingore. The first squadron scrambled from Digby was No. 46 Squadron on 3 September; told there was an incoming German raid they found nothing and returned.

October 1939 saw a number of arrivals at the station. On 10 October No. 611 Squadron RAF flying Supermarine Spitfires and No. 229 Squadron RAF operating Bristol Blenheims arrived at Digby. Initially, No. 611 Squadron flew affiliation exercises with the other two squadrons and with other new arrivals No. 44 Squadron RAF and No. 144 Squadron RAF, who were both equipped with Hampden light bombers. At the end of October a Bristol Blenheim fighter and escort Squadron arrived, No. 29 Squadron RAF. With the squadron came the soon-to-be-famous officer Guy Gibson, who would be awarded a Victoria Cross as the commander of the Dambusters. It was Gibson&#x27;s second tour at Digby as he had learned to fly at the station while attending No. 2 FTS in 1936. Gibson was still based at Digby in 1940 when he was married in Penarth, South Wales.

As 1939 came to a close King George VI made the first of three formal visits to RAF Digby. In addition to inspecting No. 46 Squadron, he presented decorations to fighter pilots from Digby and several neighbouring stations. The recipients included Guy Gibson who received his first DFC.
For six weeks in May and June 1940 the station was home to No. 222 Squadron RAF on a rotational rest and recuperation break from fighting the Battle of Britain from RAF Duxford. The squadron&#x27;s most famous flight commander was the legless fighter ace Flight Lieutenant Douglas Bader. With the station&#x27;s complement of pilots expanding nearby Wellingore Hall was requisitioned as a second officers&#x27; mess.

In late August 1940 a single German Junkers Ju 88 bomber appeared suddenly out of the mist and dropped its load of bombs on the station, all of them missing the runways and buildings to explode harmlessly on open ground. In February 1941 the first of the Canadian fighter squadrons arrived at Digby. No. 1 (Canadian) Squadron and No. 2 (Canadian) Squadron immediately renumbered as No. 401 Squadron RCAF and No. 402 Squadron RCAF respectively; both squadrons were equipped with Hurricanes. The Canadian Digby wing was formed on 24 April 1941 when the station received three further squadrons, No. 409 Squadron RCAF flying Boulton Paul Defiants, No. 411 Squadron RCAF and No. 412 Squadron RCAF both flying Supermarine Spitfires.

RAF Digby received several German bomber raids during 1941 and extensive damage was suffered. It was decided to relocate the 12 Group Sector Operations Centre away from further danger and it moved to a luxurious setting in the west wing of Blankney Hall where it stayed for the remainder of the war. Several RAF squadrons arrived to serve alongside the Canadians during 1941; No. 92 Squadron RAF and No. 609 Squadron RAF both arrived from RAF Biggin Hill on rotational rest and recuperation leave. There were now so many airmen at RAF Digby that even the two officers&#x27; messes could not accommodate them all. Several squadrons commandeered the nearby Ashby Hall as their officers&#x27; mess and the hall remained in this role until the end of the war when it fell into disrepair and its estate was broken up.

American-born pilot and poet John Gillespie Magee flying for the Canadian air force was killed at the age of 19 on 11 December 1941 while stationed at RAF Digby with No. 412 (Fighter) Squadron RCAF. Magee took off in a Spitfire from the satellite field at RAF Wellingore and, while descending through cloud over Roxholm village just south of Digby, was involved in a mid-air collision with an Airspeed Oxford climbing out of RAF Cranwell. Magee is buried at the war graves section of Scopwick churchyard along with 49 other aviators from local airfields and five German aircrew. On his grave are inscribed the first and last lines from his poem High Flight:

: &quot;Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth –
: Put out my hand and touched the Face of God.&quot;

UK bomb-disposal teams were having continuing problems rendering safe with German Butterfly bombs because no examples had been safely dismantled to learn the best process. This was because butterfly bombs were specifically designed to detonate if they were disturbed in any way. Whilst dealing with eight butterfly bombs which had fallen on RAF Harlaxton and failed to explode, Flight Sergeant Hanford of RAF Bomb Disposal (based at RAF Digby) noticed that the arming rods on the bombs had not fully unscrewed themselves i.e. the fuzes were not fully armed. Hanford carefully screwed the arming rods back into the fuze pockets by hand, thereby enabling the bomb disposal scientists to safely dismantle the fuze mechanisms, learn how they worked and develop counter-measures. Highly useful information in the form of diagrams and detailed explanations were then distributed to bomb disposal technicians for instructional purposes. Hanford was later awarded the British Empire Medal for this feat of extreme bravery.

Airfield guarding duties during the war were covered initially by a variety of Army units and later by several squadrons the RAF Regiment. In February 1941, Digby was guarded by B Company of the Royal Welch Fusiliers. From the middle of 1941 until 1942 Digby was guarded by D Company of the 70th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers.

===RCAF Digby===
On 16 September 1942 control of Digby formally passed to Canada and the station was renamed Royal Canadian Air Force Station Digby under the command of Group Captain McNab RCAF. In February 1943 the first de Havilland Mosquitos arrived at Digby and were allocated to No. 410 Squadron.

During early 1944 Digby was a hive of activity with all of the resident squadrons and several visiting squadrons, including several Czech and Belgian squadrons, taken up with training for D-day invasion support. When the invasion took place all of the squadrons relocated to captured airfields in France and Digby became an almost deserted &#x27;ghost town&#x27;. All that remained were No. 116 Squadron RAF flying a small number of Airspeed Oxfords in an anti-aircraft training role and two squadrons flying elderly Blenheims for radar calibration off the east coast.

In May 1945 control of the station was handed back by the Canadians and it again became RAF Digby, although the new station badge showed the autumn gold maple leaf to permanently acknowledge its history as a Canadian facility for three years. By the time the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945, RAF Digby had been the wartime home to 30 RAF squadrons, 13 Canadian squadrons, 4 Polish squadrons, 2 Belgian squadrons and 1 Czech squadron. Those airmen had flown Hurricane, Spitfire, Defiant, Blenheim, Beaufighter, Mosquito, Mustang, Wellington, Oxford and Anson aircraft. The station had also hosted the full range of visiting RAF heavy bombers and their crews, as well as no fewer than 30 USAAF B-17Gs on a foggy night in November 1944.

===Post-war===
Following the end of World War II Digby increasingly took on a non-flying role for RAF Technical Training Command. In 1948 the Secretarial Branch Training School relocated from RAF Hereford and the Equipment Officers&#x27; School was established at Digby. Between 1948 and 1950 Digby also became home to the No.1 Initial Officer Training unit, the Aircrew Education Unit, the Aircrew Transit Unit and the Instructional Leadership Course. In 1951 No. 2 Aircrew Grading School for both potential pilots and ancillary aircrew was established at Digby using a wide range of elderly aircraft.

The station badge was awarded in July 1952 and depicts a white crane superimposed over a maple leaf. The station&#x27;s motto &quot;Icarus Renatus&quot; means &quot;Icarus Reborn&quot; and relates to the short period when the station was under &#x27;care and maintenance&#x27; and then re-activated.

Flying ceased at Digby when all units and training schools were disbanded or relocated during January 1953 and the station was placed on care and maintenance until October 1954 when building works commenced in preparation for the establishment of the proposed signals units. No. 399 Signals Unit arrived in January 1955 and declared itself fully operational on 15 February, located in No. 2 hangar (now the station gymnasium). The second, No. 591 Signals Unit arrived in July 1955 and set up operations in hangar No. 1 (North).

In September 1959 the Wireless Operators&#x27; School and the Aerial Erectors&#x27; School were established at Digby to begin training their respective students. The station continued to expand its scope of operations steadily from the 1970s and into the new millennium. British Army elements arrived in 1994 and were later joined by the Royal Navy. The addition of US detachments signalled the start of yet another era in the history of Digby. On 1 September 1998 399 Signals Unit merged with the newly arrived Special Signals Support Unit from Loughborough to form the Joint Service Signal Unit (Digby).

No. 54 Signals Unit was established in 2014 and provides processing, exploitation, and dissemination of all UK air-derived electronic surveillance data. The unit forms part of No. 1 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Wing which has its headquarters at RAF Waddington.

<text>RFA &quot;Olmeda&quot; (A124) was an &quot;fast fleet tanker&quot; of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom. She was designed by the builders to meet specific requirements and be capable of maintaining “fleet speed” (defined as sustained steaming at 20 knots). When she entered service she was one of the largest and fastest ships in the RFA Fleet. Initially named &quot;Oleander&quot;, she was renamed after two years in operation.

The second of her class, &quot;Olmeda&quot; came into service in late 1965 as &quot;Oleander&quot;. As with her sister ships, &quot;Olmeda&#x27;s&quot; early service was routine. However, in 1967, the ship had to be renamed from &quot;Oleander&quot; to &quot;Olmeda&quot; to avoid confusion with .

In the last action of the Falklands War, &quot;Olmeda&quot; helped recapture the South Sandwich Islands.

== Design and description ==

&quot;Olmeda&quot; had a normal complement consisting 88 Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel with provision for 40 Royal Navy personnel and she was armed with two 20 mm guns and two Corvus chaff launchers. She was designed to achieve a speed of with a fully loaded displacement of .

The ship had the capability to supply fuel and other liquid cargo to vessels using four pairs of replenishment rigs which were located between the forward and aft superstructures. She was able to carry four types of fuels: Furnace Fuel Oil, Diesel, Avcat and Mogas. Limited supplies of lubricating oils, fresh water and dry stores could also be carried. She could operate Westland Wessex or Westland Sea King helicopters, or other helicopters of similar size, from a hangar and flight deck at the stern.

== Operational history ==

=== 1973 ===
During the Second Cod War, &quot;Olmeda&quot; supported Royal Navy ships twice, initially for just under three weeks, from 22 September until 10 October and then a further two weeks from 14 until 27 October.

=== 1975 ===
From 6 February 1975, she was deployed to Cyprus, due to the Turkish invasion, to support and , in support of UN Peace Keeping Force and British interests.

=== 1982 ===
==== Falklands War ====

On 5 April she sailed from HMNB Devonport for service during Operation Corporate, the Falklands Conflict, with a Fleet Air Arm Westland Sea King HAS.2 utility helicopter, reg. XV649, embarked, of 824 Naval Air Squadron &#x27;A&#x27; Flight.

&quot;Olmeda&quot; saw extensive service during the Falklands War, being one of the first ships to head south. &quot;Olmeda&quot; refuelled numerous ships of the Task Force including HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;, HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, and the SS &quot;Uganda&quot;.

After the Argentine surrender of the Falkland Islands, &quot;Olmeda&quot;, , and the tug &quot;Salvageman&quot; sailed to the South Sandwich Islands where Argentina had established a base in South Thule since 1976. Following a demonstration of &quot;Yarmouth&quot;″s guns, the ten Argentine military personnel surrendered. Before leaving South Thule, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was refueled by &quot;Olmeda&quot; on 21 June, which may have been the most southerly underway replenishment in the history of the Royal Navy.

== Decommissioning ==

In July 1994 &quot;Olmeda&quot; was sold for £1.2m to Singaporean owners and renamed &quot;Niaxco&quot;. She then sailed under her own power from Portsmouth to Alang Ship Breaking Yard in India, arriving in August. Breaking up commenced on 23 December.

<text>RFA &quot;Tidereach&quot; (A96) was a of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom. She entered service in August 1955 and served until March 1978.

== Design and construction ==

&quot;Tidereach&quot; was planned to operate with a normal complement of 100 Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel. She was fitted with the latest abeam rigs with automatic tension winches and an astern fuelling rig. The ship was able to carry 8,500 tons of Furnace Fuel Oil, 4,600 tons of diesel oil and 1,900 tons of avcat.

The construction of &quot;Tidereach&quot; was carried out in the north east of England by Swan Hunter. She was laid down on 2 June 1953 and was launched the following year, on 2 June 1954. She displaced fully loaded, 26,000 tons, was just over 583 ft in overall length and was capable of 17 knots.

== Operational history ==

&quot;Tidereach&quot; was involved in the 1956 Suez Crisis and was deployed as part of Operation Musketeer, actively involved between 6 November and 22 December. Two days later she arrived at Malta’s Grand Harbour along with RFA’s , and &quot;Wave Liberator&quot;. She had been assisting the Royal Navy with the exit of Anglo-French military units out of Port Said, Egypt.

At the start of the 1960s, along with many other RFA vessels, &quot;Tidereach&quot; was involved in the 1st Cod War with Iceland, known as Operation Mint, the conflict was over fishing rights in the North Atlantic, and she deployed supporting Royal Navy warships off the coast of Iceland. The summer of 1961 saw her deploy on Operation Vantage, which was to support Kuwait against territorial claims by Iraq, where she provided material assistance for the in July and August, deployed along with eleven other RFA vessels.

During 1965 &quot;Tidereach&quot; was deployed during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, between January and August, to provide auxiliary support the Royal Navy in the Strait of Malacca, off Singapore and waters off the coast of Malaysia, in company with the RFA’s fleet support tanker , the coastal tanker , the stores issuing ship and the fleet support tanker .

== Decommissioning and fate ==

She was then laid up in Portsmouth for disposal. On 22 February 1979 she was sold for scrap, and left Portsmouth under tow on 16 March 1979. On 20 March 1979 she arrived at Bilbao, Spain to be broken up.

<doc id="527077" wikidata="Q1553022" url="?curid=527077" title="Wilson effect (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, the Wilson effect is the perceived depression of a sunspot&#x27;s umbra, or center, in the Sun&#x27;s photosphere. The magnitude of the depression for the umbra is between 500 and 1000 km, with an average of 600 km.

Sunspots result from the blockage of convective heat transport by intense magnetic fields. Sunspots are cooler than the rest of the photosphere, with effective temperatures of about 4,000°C (about 7,000°F). Sunspot occurrence follows an approximately 11-year period known as the solar cycle, discovered by Heinrich Schwabe in the 19th century.

==History==

In 1769, during solar cycle 2, Scottish astronomer Alexander Wilson, working at the Macfarlane Observatory, noticed that the shape of sunspots noticeably flattened as they approached the Sun&#x27;s limb due to solar rotation.
 These observations were published in 1774 and showed that sunspots were features on the solar surface, as opposed to minor planets or objects above it. Moreover, he observed what is now termed the Wilson effect: the penumbra and umbra vary in the manner expected by perspective effects if the umbrae of the spots are in fact slight depressions in the surface of the photosphere.

==Alternate interpretations==
While the surface-depression interpretation of the Wilson effect is widespread, Bray and Loughhead contended that &quot;the true explanation of the Wilson effect lies in the higher transparency of the spot material compared to the photosphere&quot;. A similar interpretation was expressed by C.H. Tong.

<text>Georgia State Route400 (SR400; commonly known as Georgia400) is a freeway and state highway in the U.S. state of Georgia serving parts of Metro Atlanta. It is concurrent with U.S. Route19 (US19) from exit 4 (Interstate285) until its northern terminus south-southeast of Dahlonega, linking the city of Atlanta to its north-central suburbs and exurbs. SR400 travels from the Lindbergh neighborhood in the Buckhead district of Atlanta, at Interstate85 (I-85), to just south-southeast of Dahlonega. Like the Interstate highways, it is a limited-access road (with interchanges instead of intersections), but unlike the interstates (which were renumbered by GDOT in 2000), the exit numbers are not mileage-based, they are sequential. Once SR400 passes exit 18 (SR 369), it changes from a limited-access freeway into an at-grade divided highway with traffic lights, but still with a high speed limit of , and ends at the J.B. Jones Intersection at SR 60/SR115 in Lumpkin County.

Between I-85 and I-285, SR400 is designated &quot;T.Harvey Mathis Parkway&quot;, after a local land developer and road proponent who died the day after being appointed as head of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games in June 1991, when the tollway was under construction. Upon reaching the Perimeter (I-285) and beyond, the highway is designated &quot;Turner McDonald Parkway&quot;, after a Fulton County Public Works Department director. 

SR400 is one of only two state routes in the 400–499 series to not be designated as an unsigned route following an interstate, with the other being the SR410 near Stone Mountain. Both SR400 andSR 410 were originally planned as interstate routes: SR400 was supposed to be I-485 and SR410 was supposed to be I-675.

==Route description==

SR 400 begins at I-85 just north of Downtown Atlanta. SR 400 travels concurrently with MARTA&#x27;s Red Line between its Buckhead and Medical Center stops; the Red Line&#x27;s final stop is at the North Springs station. SR 400 southbound can access the station via Exit 5C, and traffic from the station can enter SR 400 northbound.

SR 400 goes through a tunnel under the Atlanta Financial Center in Buckhead, south of SR 400&#x27;s exit 2 (SR 141 Connector/Lenox Road). Farther north, SR 400 meets I-285, also known as &quot;The Perimeter&quot; or &quot;Atlanta Bypass&quot;.

At I-285, SR 400 meets with US 19. The two travel concurrently until an intersection with SR 60 and SR 115 in Dahlonega.

North of I-285, SR 400 travels through Sandy Springs, Roswell, and Alpharetta in Fulton County. Major junctions include SR 140 (exit 7A/7B on SR 400 northbound and exit 7 on SR 400 southbound) and SR 120 (exit 10).

From US 19 and I-285 in Sandy Springs, SR 9 travels parallel to SR 400 to the west until SR 9 reaches Coal Mountain. In Coal Mountain, SR 9 veers northwest away from SR 400, but then later turns northeast toward its northern terminus at its intersection at US 19 in downtown Dahlonega.

SR 400&#x27;s exit 6 at Northridge Road is known as the Mayor Eva Cohn Galambos Memorial Interchange.

From SR 400&#x27;s exit 8, Mansell Road, to exit 11, Windward Parkway, North Point Parkway travels parallel to the east of SR 400. North Point Parkway provides access to North Point Mall.

SR 400 enters Forsyth County at the overpass of McGinnis Ferry Road. In the county, SR 400 travels through Cumming and Coal Mountain. Major interchanges include SR 141 (exit 13), SR 20 (exit 14A/14B on SR 400 northbound; exit 14 on SR 400 southbound), SR 306 (exit 17), and SR 369. SR 400&#x27;s limited-access portion ends at SR 369, and SR 400 continues on.

Travelers can access Bald Ridge Marina and boat ramps for Lake Lanier via exits 15 (Bald Ridge Marina Road) and 16 (Pilgrim Mill Road).

North of SR 400&#x27;s intersection with Jot Em Down Road, SR 400 continues into Dawson County, where it travels through Dawsonville. Major intersections include SR 53 and SR 136.

At the intersection of SR 400 and SR 53, a continuous-flow intersection was completed in May 2017. Near this intersection is the entrance to North Georgia Premium Outlets.

SR 400 continues into Lumpkin County just south of its intersection with Whelchel Road and Wilson Drive. After traveling in the county, SR 400 and US 19 meet SR 115 from the north and SR 60 from the east. SR 400 ends at this point, and US 19 turns left and continues north through downtown Dahlonega into the Appalachian Mountains and the Chattahoochee–Oconee National Forest.

All of SR 400 south of the Dawson–Lumpkin county line is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

Exits on the controlled-access part of SR 400 are numbered according to the consecutive numbering system instead of reference post (i.e. mile-based) numbering. This is unlike the Interstate highways in Georgia, which have used reference post numbering since 2000, with the exception of I-24, which continues the exit numbering from Tennessee as the interstate highway crosses through Georgia back into Tennessee. This means that exit numbers on SR 400 start at 1 and use consecutive numbers (2, 3, 4, etc.) regardless of the nearest mile marker.

At the southern terminus, new ramps connecting SR 400 south to I-85 north and I-85 south to SR 400 north opened on April 2, 2014. The project was two years in the making and was paid for with funds from the SR 400 toll plaza. Prior, drivers had to exit off SR 400 onto Sidney Marcus Boulevard to get to I-85 north. On I-85 south, drivers had to take the Cheshire Bride Road/Lenox Road exit to get to Sidney Marcus Boulevard for access onto SR 400 north. The ramp from I-85 south is shared with the SR 13 ramp (exit 86). From SR 400, Sidney Marcus Boulevard is now exit 1B and the ramp to I-85 north is 1A.

In Forsyth County in 2017–2018, SR 400 was expanded from two lanes to three from McFarland Parkway to SR 369 (which is planned to be exit 18).

==History==

Planning for the freeway, later known as the North Fulton Expressway and the Appalachian Developmental Highway, began in 1954. The initial section north of I-285 was officially dedicated on May24, 1971 and subsequent additions to the north opened in stages through 1981.

Initial development was led by Fulton County Public Works Department director Turner McDonald, who worked for the county from 1947 until retiring in 1980. In January 1974, the Georgia General Assembly named a stretch of the highway from I-285 to the Fulton-Forsyth county line after McDonald. At the end of that year, on December23, McDonald attended a ceremony officially dedicating the segment between Union Hill Road and SR20 as Turner McDonald Parkway.

The road was widened in the late 1980s from its original four-lane configuration to eight lanes between I-285 and Holcomb Bridge Road, and to six lanes between Holcomb Bridge Road and Haynes Bridge Road. The widening projects were brought on by the massive growth that the freeway brought to northern Fulton and southern Forsyth counties. In 2005 the GDOT began widening the section from Holcomb Bridge Road to McFarland Parkway from six to eight lanes. In addition, metal noise barrier walls and a concrete divider in the median were also added. In 2010, a half-diamond interchange (exit 4C) was added on the north side of Hammond Drive, allowing southbound exits and northbound entrances.

The northern portion of the inside-the-Perimeter route remained alive following the freeway revolts, and after lawsuits by residents that spent several years in court, GDOT was able to force the extension through Buckhead. Dozens of homes were taken through eminent domain or the threat of it, and the highway was built through the middle of formerly-secluded and forested neighborhoods. Some remaining residents live on dead end streets with metal barrier walls. During planning stages of the highway in 1984, the Robinson-Humphrey Bank Company proposed a massive expansion of its office building in Buckhead, now known as the Atlanta Financial Center, which was to be built directly in the proposed routing of the highway. A compromise was worked out for Fulton County to pay $3million to Robinson-Humphrey to offset extra construction costs. This allowed the new tower to be constructed with special concrete supports allowing for the highway and eventual MARTA Red Line to run underneath; the deal also covered Robinson-Humphrey&#x27;s $1 million donation of the right-of-way to the Georgia DOT. Construction of the massive tunnel underneath the office complex and its parking garage was underway in 1990; the tunnel was sealed off with concrete to protect the building from noise and vibration. The original plans for the North Tollway put interchanges at Marion Road (now Sidney Marcus Boulevard), Peachtree Road at North Stratford Road, Wieuca Road, Windsor Parkway, and Johnston Ferry Road. By 1972, plans had been adjusted to exclude the Wieuca Road exit and add an expressway connecting Andrews Road at Roswell Road to Peachtree Road at Lenox Road as an alternative to a direct interchange with Peachtree Road. The mainline toll booth would have been south of Peachtree Road. By 1986, the present alignment with only 3 exits (Marion Road, Buckhead Loop/Lenox Road, and Glenridge Connector) and a single tollbooth north of Peachtree Road were finalized, eliminating direct access to both Peachtree Road and the residential Buckhead neighborhoods. Atlanta City Council member Buddy Fowlkes was opposed to the extension of GA400; &quot;I&#x27;m encouraged,&quot; he said in 1989. &quot;People are starting to understand that there are alternatives to the Georgia 400 extension.&quot; In 1991, the State Road and Tollway Authority authorized $96million in bonds to pay for the GA400 Buckhead extension which would be paid back by 2011 with toll revenue. 
The road opened to traffic on August1, 1993, after three years of construction. Existing exits were renumbered up by four to accommodate the extension, which had a single toll plaza in the middle of its length when opened.

In addition, the North Line (now Red Line) for Atlanta&#x27;s MARTA train system was constructed in the median from the Glenridge Connector to south of Lenox Road, and was opened on June8, 1996, extending the line from Lenox Square mall north to Perimeter Mall, and connecting the Perimeter Center area to the rail system. That edge city largely developed due to its proximity to the 400/285 interchange.

Direct access from SR400 southbound to I-85 northbound (and the reverse direction) opened in April 2014, ending the need to take the indirect route via Sidney Marcus Boulevard. In June 2015, a ceremony was held to name the flyover bridges for Captain Herb Emory, a beloved local traffic reporter for WSB AM and WSB-TV (as well as other co-owned stations) who had died in April 2014. At one time, SR400 was to connect to I-675 in southeast DeKalb county. However, residents in intown Atlanta neighborhoods did not want the highway to cut through and partially destroy their neighborhoods (as had occurred in Sweet Auburn and other neighborhoods), and a freeway revolt ensued, ending when then-Governor Jimmy Carter signed a new city charter and the USDOT rejected the highway studies in 1973, and George Busbee had the plan officially terminated when he became governor in 1975. The point where this road would have had its interchange with the also-doomed I-485 (now Freedom Parkway and SR10 to Stone Mountain Freeway) is now the site of the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum. A later routing of I-485 would have had that number running from the Downtown Connector east to the current library, then north on what is now SR400. A revival of the connection to I-675 was proposed in 2009. A tunnel would go under East Atlanta and other neighborhoods in Atlanta on the DeKalb-county side, south to I-20. A surface road through less-developed land would then go south to I-675. The project would be a public/private initiative. As of September 2024, the project is not on the GDOT&#x27;s Major Mobility Investment Program List

Funding for a project to create a new interchange on SR 400 at SR 369/Browns Bridge Rd came from the Forsyth County Transportation Bond, approved by voters in 2014, along with GDOT funding. Previously, SR400 met SR369 at a signalized intersection, where the freeway part of SR400 ended. Plans showed that a partial cloverleaf interchange would be built, with ramps from both directions of SR400 meeting SR369 at traffic lights; the northbound SR400 ramp would also meet at the entrance of Browns Bridge Church. Also as a part of this project, SR369 will be widened from its intersection with SR9, through the interchange at SR400, to its intersection at SR306. The widening project is currently still underway as of 2023. Workers cleared the area and removed underground storage tanks, per county officials. Forsyth County acquired four properties as part of right-of-way acquisition and is expected to go out for bid in the fall of 2019; a bid is expected to be awarded in early 2020. Construction began in late 2020 and the interchange opened in early 2023.

==Tolls==

When SR 400 was a toll road, the toll plaza, operated by the State Road and Tollway Authority (SR TA), collected 50¢ tolls in both the northbound and southbound directions. The toll plaza was located north of Lenox Road (exit 2). Each direction had two open-road toll lanes, which collected tolls at highway speeds using the Georgia Peach Pass electronic tag (formerly &quot;Cruise Card&quot;), and seven gated toll lanes that accepted cash. The toll facility handled a total of approximately 120,000 vehicles per day. About 37% of transactions were paid via Peach Pass, the same technology also used by SunPass in Florida, Quick Pass in North Carolina, TxTag in Texas, and PikePass in Oklahoma. Peach Pass can be used interchangeably with the Florida and North Carolina systems and passes, but not with TxTag and PikePass, due to a lack of reciprocal billing arrangements with those non-adjacent states.

SR 400 was the only active toll road in Georgia, after the Torras Causeway toll between Brunswick and St. Simons Island on the southeastern Georgia coast was removed in 2003, until the high occupancy toll express lanes opened on I-85 in 2011. The SR 400 toll was to expire in 2011 after 20 years. In March 2009, local TV news reports brought up an issue regarding tolls on the road, since SRTA reported that enough money has been collected to pay the bonds used to construct the road (though prepayment prior to 2011 was prohibited). Despite promises that the toll would be removed once the road was paid for, the tolls continued to be collected. The road costs $2 million per year just to maintain (plus occasional repaving), and it cost several million more for the demolition of the toll plaza. (One option would have been to simply close the toll plaza, allowing drivers to pass through without paying.) On September 24, 2010, then Governor Sonny Perdue and members of the State Road and Tollway Authority (SRTA) voted to keep the tolls on until 2020 in order to fund 11 new projects on the highway.

In July 2012, two weeks before voters of Georgia voted on the Transportation Referendum act, Governor Deal said that the toll on SR 400 would be abandoned in November 2013, meaning that, at the beginning of 2014, SR 400 would be a toll-free road. Tolling was discontinued on November 22, 2013, at 11:08 am; the last toll was collected by Governor Nathan Deal and was paid by the same couple that paid the first toll in 1993. The toll plaza was removed in a four-phase demolition project.

In 2012, a feasibility study was initiated by the Georgia Department of Transportation to explore the possibility of adding tolled express lanes. The proposed express lanes would be long, and mirror the existing lanes on I-85. The lanes&#x27; southern terminus will be I-285 in Sandy Springs, and their northern terminus would be SR 20 in Cumming. Fees would be similar to the existing I-85 lanes, and will be paid using Peach Pass, making the express lanes compatible with the existing express lanes on I-85 (as well as the former toll plaza in Buckhead if it had remained in operation).

== Future ==

=== McGinnis Ferry Road Interchange ===
A traffic study in 2007 explored the possibility of a new interchange on SR 400 at McGinnis Ferry Road; this Interchange Feasibility Report was approved by GDOT in 2010 and Forsyth County in 2012. The exit is to be located between Exit 11 (Windward 
Parkway) and Exit 12 (McFarland Parkway). Construction started in October 2021, and is expected to be completed in 2023. Construction will be completed by Forsyth County and GDOT. As a part of the project, one lane each way will be added on SR 400 between the Windward Pkwy exit and the McFarland Pkwy exit, and SR 400 S will have an additional lane added between McFarland Pkwy and McGinnis Ferry Rd. Also, as part of the construction:

* The McGinnis Ferry Rd bridge over SR 400 will be replaced.
* McGinnis Ferry Rd will be widened to four lanes from Bethany Bend to the SR 400 intersection, and to six lanes from the SR 400 interchange to the intersection of McGinnis Ferry Rd, Union Hill Rd, and Ronald Reagan Blvd. Ronald Reagan Blvd will also be widened to six lanes from McGinnis Ferry Rd to Counselors Way.
* Sidewalks will be added on the southbound side of McGinnis Ferry Rd, and a multi-use path will be added on the northbound side of McGinnis Ferry Rd. 
* Additional right and left turn lanes will be added on McGinnis Ferry Rd at major intersections.

This project complements construction to extend Ronald Reagan Blvd from McFarland Pkwy to Majors Rd.

=== I-285 Interchange ===
GDOT, working with North Perimeter Contractors, began construction in February 2017 at the SR 400/I-285 interchange to add collector-distributor lanes and flyover ramps to ease congestion at the interchange. The interchange currently sees 420,000 drivers each day, despite that the current interchange was designed to accommodate 100,000 drivers daily. The project is expected to cost $800 million and is estimated to save drivers on SR 400 and I-285 a combined 20,000 hours of driving time each day. The project will also include:
* The conversion of the SR 400 and Abernathy Rd (exit 5) to a diverging diamond interchange.
* The reconstruction of the Mount Vernon Hwy bridge over SR 400, the Peachtree Dunwoody Rd bridge over I-285, and the Glenridge Dr bridge over I-285.
* The construction of multi-use paths along the southeastern portion of SR 400 and I-285, and path improvements along Mount Vernon Hwy and Abernathy Rd. These improvements will also connect to Path 400.

Construction was originally expected to be completed by 2020, but due to discovering unmarked utility lines, and labor shortages &amp; supply-chain problems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, will now continue into 2025.

=== SR 400 Express Lanes ===

GDOT is currently conducting environmental studies to study the impact of new express toll lanes each way on SR 400, starting at the North Springs MARTA station and traveling 16 miles along SR 400 to the McFarland Pkwy exit (exit 12). The express lanes, for which drivers will need a Peach Pass to travel on, will be two buffer-separated lanes each way from the North Springs MARTA station to McGinnis Ferry Rd and one buffer-separated lane each way from McGinnis Ferry Rd to McFarland Pkwy. The express lanes will use &#x27;dynamic pricing,&#x27; so drivers will pay higher prices during rush hour; but, transit buses and registered vanpools will not have to pay additional fees to use these lanes. In addition, a bus rapid transit system, Georgia&#x27;s first, will run along the express lanes; the system will possibly include bus access to stops at or near the North Spring MARTA station, Holcomb Bridge Rd, North Point Mall, Old Milton Pkwy, and an existing MARTA park and ride at Windward Pkwy. The local SR 400 lanes and the express lanes are expected to have direct merges around Northridge Rd (exit 6), Haynes Bridge Rd (exit 9) and at its terminus at McFarland Pkwy; expected direct access ramps will be located at the North Springs MARTA station, Holcomb Bridge Rd (exit 7), Webb Bridge Road, and Union Hill Rd.

Construction was to begin in 2021, but due to increased costs (which exceeded GDOT&#x27;s $1.7 billion budget) had to be delayed. A new developer is expected to be announced in early 2024, construction to begin in 2025, and substantial completion to take place in 2031. As a part of the project, GDOT has said that they might be acquiring around 50 homes near the North Springs MARTA station, as well as small pieces of land along SR 400 north of Sandy Springs.

==== Expansion of SR 400 Express Lanes to I-285 ====
GDOT is also working on environmental studies for express lanes along the top end of I-285, from Paces Ferry Rd to Henderson Rd, with construction slated to start in 2023 and finish in 2029. Once this project is complete, GDOT will add express lanes along SR 400 from the North Springs MARTA station south to meet with the I-285 express lanes once they are completed.

==Filming on GA 400==
Several scenes from the movie &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; were filmed on SR 400, which was used due to the low traffic volumes at the time of filming during its construction. The &quot;Alabama&quot; police chase, where a Georgia State Patrol car chases Bandit, who is driving a Trans-Am, takes place on SR 400 at the interchange with SR 141/Peachtree Pkwy, Exit 13. In addition, other film scenes were shot along SR 400 between McFarland Pkwy in Alpharetta (Exit 12) and SR 20/Buford Hwy in Cumming (Exit 14). Filming also took place in other parts of metro Atlanta, including McDonough and Jonesboro.

<text>The Oregon Supreme Court (OSC) is the highest state court in the U.S. state of Oregon. The only court that may reverse or modify a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the United States. The OSC holds court at the Oregon Supreme Court Building in Salem, Oregon, near the capitol building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state&#x27;s law library, while the courtroom is also used by the Oregon Court of Appeals.

Tracing its heritage to 1841 when Oregon pioneers selected a Supreme Judge with probate powers, the court has grown from a single judge to its current make up of seven justices. Justices of the court serve six-year terms upon election, however vacancies are filled by appointments of the Governor of Oregon until the next general election when any qualified candidate may run for the position, including the appointee. These seven justices then select one member to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. The court&#x27;s Chief Justice is not only responsible for assigning cases to the other justices to write the court&#x27;s opinions, but is also the chief executive of the Oregon Judicial Department.

Primarily an appeals court, the Oregon Supreme Court is also the court of last resort in Oregon. Although most oral arguments before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools. All cases are heard en banc by the court. It receives appeals from the Oregon Tax Court, the Oregon Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. Decisions of the court are published in the &quot;Oregon Reporter&quot; published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed out of the old Oregon Country region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.

==Selection==
The court is composed of seven elected justices, each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election. Justices, like other Oregon state court judges, must be United States citizens, Oregon residents for at least three years, and lawyers admitted to practice in the state of Oregon. The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed &quot;the broom closet&quot;) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted. When a state court judge retires, resigns, or dies before completing a term, the Governor may appoint another qualified person to the position. To retain that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election.

On occasion, a judge will leave office at the end of a term, in which case a general election determines their replacement. If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness, an unfilled position, or a justice is disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest, the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore. Senior judges are all former, qualified judges (a minimum of 12 years on the bench) that have retired from a state court. Only former Supreme Court justices, elected Oregon circuit court judges, or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges can be assigned to temporary service on the Supreme Court.

==Administrative==

The court can appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve temporarily as judges at any level in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below the highest level of court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also in the hands of the Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.

===Chief justice===
One justice of the court is elected by the court to serve a six-year term as chief justice. The chief justice is then responsible for all administration of the Supreme Court. Under a law enacted in 1981, the chief justice is not only the titular head of the Supreme Court but also the chief executive officer of the Oregon Judicial Department. In that role, the chief justice supervises all of the Oregon courts, appoints the chief judge of the Oregon Court of Appeals, assigns presiding judges for the trial level state courts, makes court rules, and is in charge of the department&#x27;s budget. As administrator the chief justice is also the recipient of many reports from the court system including non-legal employees of the department. The first chief justice of the Oregon Supreme Court was William P. Bryant, while the longest serving chief was Wallace P. Carson, Jr. who held the position for 15 years.

===Oregon Reports===
Beginning in 1853, the official court reporter for the publication of all Supreme Court decisions was the Oregon Reports, abbreviated &quot;Or.&quot; or &quot;Ore.&quot; in case citations. These bound editions are published under the authority of the Oregon Supreme Court as authorized by state law.

Joseph G. Wilson started in 1853 as the clerk for the court and was responsible for the Oregon Reports until 1870, though he also served as a justice of the court from 1862 to 1870. Later federal judge Charles B. Bellinger then took over editing the reports, and served as clerk until 1880. He was followed by T. B. Odeneal, J. A. Stratton, and W. H. Holmes, until 1889 when a law was passed that included a provision that the chief justice take over this responsibility. This arrangement only lasted a few years, as in 1891 a new law allowed the court to hire an official reporter, with later chief justice George H. Burnett serving as the first official reporter.

The first reported opinion in the Oregon Reports was &quot;Thompson v. Backenstos&quot;, involving a case about trespassing. In the case, Justice George Henry Williams wrote the opinion, Justice Thomas Nelson had served as the judge at the trial level due to circuit riding, while future justice Reuben P. Boise served as counsel for the defense, and fellow future justice Aaron E. Waite provided counsel for the plaintiff.

==Powers and jurisdiction==

The powers of the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution&#x27;s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts primarily as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied an appeal to the Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.

The court also reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items regarding legal discipline on direct review. Direct review means that the Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter&#x27;s Pamphlet.

Oregon&#x27;s state courts are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases regardless of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).

Although only the United States Supreme Court can overturn the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon&#x27;s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).

==History==
Following the journey of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805, the region known as Oregon Country experienced increased activity and exploration by Europeans and Americans. Beginning with the fur trade, settlement by Euro-Americans began as early as 1811 with the founding of Fort Astoria and slowly increased until the 1830s. In the 1830s additional settlement occurred, agricultural production increased, and missionaries started religious missions in the region. In 1835, the first trial in the region was held with John Kirk Townsend presiding as magistrate over a murder charge. Pioneer settlers continued to immigrate to the region, with larger wagon trains crossing the Oregon Trail in the 1840s bringing more immigrants and a need for courts.

===Pre-statehood===
The Oregon Supreme Court traces its roots back to the early settlement period of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young&#x27;s estate. Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.

In 1843, a later set of meetings at Champoeg created the Provisional Government of Oregon with a judiciary consisting of a Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace for trial level courts. Albert E. Wilson was the first judge chosen as the Supreme Judge under this new government, but never served. Other judges were appointed or elected during this pre-territory period over the next six years. Until 1846 with the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute, the region was not under the jurisdiction of any foreign power. With the resolution of the boundary issue, Britain retained the territory north of the 49th degree of latitude, with the United States taking the land south to the border of Mexican control California.

In 1848, when the Oregon Territory was created by the United States Congress, William P. Bryant was appointed as the first judge of the Oregon Supreme Court. Justices in the territorial period were appointed by the President of the United States. In those early days of the court, the justices would &quot;ride circuit&quot; in addition to their appellate court functions. Riding circuit involved acting as appeals court judges around the state in addition to the supreme court functions of ultimate appeal, a common practice in early American courts.

===Oregon State Supreme Court===
Beginning with statehood in 1859, the court had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until the population of the state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.

Then in 1862 the court was expanded to five justices with the addition of a fifth judicial district. Also that year the Court hired its first clerk after the legislature authorized that position. In 1878, the legislature passed an act to separate the circuit and supreme courts after the population reached 100,000. With the creation of a separate Circuit Court and Supreme Court, riding circuit was abandoned and the Supreme Court was reduced to three members, with members of each court elected separately. Governor Thayer then appointed James K. Kelly, Reuben P. Boise, and Paine Page Prim to the court as temporary justices until elections could be held. During these early years of the court the selection of the Chief Justice was governed by the Oregon Constitution, with the senior justice or the justice with their term was next to expire was designated as the Chief Justice. This meant that a new chief would be selected at least every two years, and in general meant someone elected would serve their first four years on the bench as an associate justice and the last two years as the Chief Justice.

Mary Leonard became the first woman admitted to the state bar on April 13, 1886, when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included the state legislature passing a new law to allow women to be admitted. In 1906, the Oregon court upheld a maximum hour law for women in &quot;State v. Muller&quot;, 48 Or. 252, 85 P. 855 (1906). Due partly to a brief by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Oregon law in &quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot;, 208 U.S. 412 (1908) despite ruling in 1905 in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional. Then in 1910, the state legislature expanded the court back to five justices, and lastly, in 1913 the court expanded to the current seven justices.

The next important case came in 1935 when the state&#x27;s top court ruled in &quot;State v. De Jonge&quot;, 152 Or. 315, 51 P.2d 674 (1935) that the 14th Amendment did not protect Communist Party organizers from prosecution under Oregon&#x27;s criminal syndicate law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn this decision in &quot;De Jonge v. Oregon&quot;, 299 U.S. 353 (1937). Another important case came in 1960 as the Oregon court ruled against the United States government in &quot;State Land Board v. United States&quot;, 222 Or. 40, 352 P.2d 539 (1960). In that case the court ruled that state estate laws trumped a federal statute concerning the property of U.S. Veterans who died at Veterans Administration hospitals without a valid will. The U.S. Supreme Court then overturned the Oregon Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;United States v. Oregon&quot;, 366 U. S. 643 (1961).

On the administrative end of the court, the Oregon Court of Appeals was created in 1969 as an intermediate appellate court in Oregon. With this change, the Supreme Court now generally does not hear appeals directly from the trial level courts of the state, with some exceptions such as death penalty cases. Other changes came in 1981 when the Oregon Legislature and justice Arno Denecke reformed the chief justice position from a simple head of the court in title only, to the administrative head of the entire Oregon judicial system. The following year, 1982, the court received its first female member when Governor Vic Atiyeh appointed Betty Roberts as an associate justice. Then from 1991 to 2005 Wallace P. Carson, Jr. served as chief justice of the court for a record 14 years.

The next landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving the Oregon Supreme Court was &quot;Dolan v. City of Tigard&quot;, 512 U.S. 374 (1994). In that land use case the Oregon court found the requirements placed on the business owner as conditions to approve an expansion were not a taking under the United States Constitution&#x27;s takings clause. However, the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and overturned the Oregon court. Then the Oregon court ruled in February 2006 that Oregon&#x27;s land use law, Measure 37, was constitutional. &quot;Macpherson v. Department of Administrative Services&quot;, 340 Or. 117, 130 P.3d 308 (2006) allowed people to make claims against the government forcing the government to either pay compensation when land use regulations reduced the value of a property owners land or waive the regulation.

===Location===

In the early years of the Supreme Court, business was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first public building to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it burned to the ground. In 1876, the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor. This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet, while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25, 1935.

In addition to holding court in the Supreme Court Building&#x27;s third floor courtroom, the court also travels around the state to hold sessions. This includes sessions at colleges, high schools, and the state&#x27;s three law schools. These three law schools, Willamette University College of Law, University of Oregon Law School, and Lewis &amp; Clark Law School, use the visits as educational tools.

==Current justices==

The court has had a total of 106 individuals serve on the court since its creation during the territorial period. This has ranged from a membership of three justices to seven justices. Since 1913, the number of positions on the bench has been seven. Of the current membership, three are women and four are men. Overall, the court has had ten women compared to ninety-seven men serve on the court.

The newest members of the court are Stephen Bushong, Bronson James and Aruna Masih, who joined in 2023. All of the seven current justices first joined the court as appointees of the governor of Oregon to fill mid-term vacancies.
==Notable Supreme Court cases==

Over the course of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number of decisions as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover a wide range of topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the cases that have had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<text>RFA &quot;Tidespring&quot; (A75) was a of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. As a replenishment oiler, her main purpose was to refuel other ships. The ship had a long career in the RFA, entering service in the early 1960s, and finally being decommissioned in 1991.

&quot;Tidespring&quot; took part in the Falklands War, particularly in the recapture of South Georgia. At the time, she was carrying &quot;M&quot; Company of 42 Commando Royal Marines. The ship accommodated prisoners of war taken during operations. The Falklands conflict provided a reprieve of ten years for &quot;Tidespring&quot; which had been due to decommission in 1982.

== Design and construction ==

&quot;Tidespring&quot; had a normal complement consisting 110 Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel with provision for up to twenty-four Royal Navy personnel. She was designed with abeam replenishment at sea rigs, which had automatic tensioning winches and she had an astern fuelling rig. &quot;Tidespring&quot; was also fitted with a single spot 50 x 70 ft helicopter deck, designed to be capable of handling the Royal Navy Westland Wessex helicopters used at the time. She had hangar facilities for a single helicopter and could support aviation refuelling. The ship was built to carry 9,500 tons of Furnace Fuel Oil, 5,500 tons of diesel oil and 2,000 tons of avcat and the forward hold could take dry cargo.

The construction of &quot;Tidespring&quot; was carried out by the shipbuilder Hawthorn Leslie, at Hebburn. The ship was laid down on 24 July 1961 and launched the following year on 3 May 1962.

<text>RFA &quot;Tidepool&quot; (A76) was a of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

&quot;Tidepool&quot; had a long and busy life in the fleet. The ship participated in both the Cod Wars and the Beira Patrol during the 1970s. In 1982 when the Falklands War broke out &quot;Tidepool&quot; was on its way to Chile to be disposed of. The ship was temporarily reclaimed by the United Kingdom and was finally handed over to the Chilean Navy on 13 August 1982 and renamed &quot;Almirante Jorge Montt&quot;.

== Design and construction ==

&quot;Tidepool&quot; had a normal complement consisting 110 Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel with provision for up to 24 Royal Navy personnel. She was designed with abeam replenishment at sea rigs, which had automatic tensioning winches and she had an astern fuelling rig. &quot;Tidepool&quot; was also fitted with a single spot 50 x 70 ft helicopter deck, designed to be capable of handling the Royal Navy Westland Wessex helicopters used at the time. She had hangar facilities for a single helicopter and could support aviation refuelling. The ship was built to carry 9,500 tons of Furnace Fuel Oil, 5,500 tons of diesel oil and 2,000 tons of avcat and the forward hold could take dry cargo. 

The construction of &quot;Tidepool&quot; was carried out by the shipbuilder Hawthorn Leslie, at Hebburn. The ship was laid down on 4 December 1961 and launched twelve months later on 11 December 1962. She displaced, fully loaded, 27,400 tons, was just under 584 ft in overall length and was capable of 17 knots.

== Operational history ==

&quot;Tidepool&quot; was completed and entered service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary on 11 December 1962, replacing the fleet support tanker .

=== Beira Patrol ===

Along with air stores support ship and the armament support ship , &quot;Tidepool&quot; was deployed on the Beira Patrol in the Mozambique Channel in March 1966, to enforce United Nations sanctions against Rhodesia. The RFA provided support for initially a Royal Navy aircraft carrier and two frigates. On this deployment &quot;Tidepool&quot; claimed the record for the longest time in the Mozambique Channel at fifty-three days, and was continuously at sea for eighty-one days.

=== Task Group 317.5 ===

On 25 January 1977 &quot;Tidepool&quot; left HMNB Devonport as part of Task Group 317.5, for an Atlantic deployment led by the Royal Navy’s converted helicopter cruiser , in the company of the RFA’s small fleet tanker and the fleet stores ship . She returned to the United Kingdom in May.

=== Task Group 317.6 ===

On 5 September 1977, along with RFA’s small fleet tanker , the ammunition, explosives and stores supply ship and the fleet stores ship &quot;Tarbatness&quot;, &quot;Tidepool&quot; departed HMNB Portsmouth involved in Task Group 317.7, again supporting the helicopter cruiser &quot;Tiger&quot;, the task group’s flagship, and accompanied by the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Rothesay&quot;-class frigate . The deployment was for seven and half months, and covered Australia and the Far East. She returned to the United Kingdom on 20 April 1978.

<text>RFA &quot;Reliant&quot; (A131) was a helicopter support ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. 
She was built in 1977 in Poland, at the Gdańsk Shipyard, as a conventional container ship with roll-on/roll-off capability for loading vehicles and containers for the Harrison Line. She was named &quot;Astronomer&quot;. She was taken up from the trade in 1982 for service in the Falklands War as an aircraft transport, being fitted with a temporary mid-ships flight deck and hangar forward to carry 13 helicopters.

At the end of 1982 she was chartered by the UK MoD and a more substantial conversion was undertaken, and was fitted with the Arapaho containerized aircraft handling system, a hangar and a flight deck and she was commissioned into the RFA Fleet as RFA &quot;Reliant&quot;. Her first operational sortie was to the coast of Lebanon in support of the Multinational Force in Lebanon and the British Army units based in Beirut, eventually evacuating the same in February 1984. Upon returning to UK she proceeded to the Falklands for what was expected to be an extended deployment. However, it did not last long as the Arapaho system proved to be unsatisfactory for handling aircraft. She was decommissioned in 1986 and sold back into conventional merchant service.

<text>RFA &quot;Engadine&quot; (K08) was a helicopter support ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

The need for &quot;Engadine&quot; was seen in the mid-1960s as more and more helicopters were deployed from Royal Navy aircraft carriers and surface combatants. The ship was ordered in August 1964, from Henry Robb of Leith, and commissioned in December 1967, replacing . She was the third British ship named HMS &quot;Engadine&quot; the previous two being a seaplane carrier and an aircraft transport ship. &quot;Engadine&quot; comes from the Engadin valley in south-east Switzerland, which is represented by the alphorns and edelweiss on her badge.

In 1968 she was designated as one of the PYTHON locations for the dispersal and continuity of government in the event of nuclear war.

&quot;Engadine&quot;&#x27;s homeport throughout her career was Portland, Dorset. During the 1976 crisis in Lebanon she was deployed as part of contingency planning to evacuate British citizens.

At the Silver Jubilee fleet review in 1977 she followed the royal yacht .

In the Falklands War she was a helicopter support and refuelling ship in San Carlos Water.

By the mid-1980s &quot;Engadine&quot; was becoming obsolescent so the container ship MV &quot;Contender Bezant&quot; was bought for conversion, becoming . &quot;Engadine&quot; was decommissioned in 1989 and sold to new owners in Greece. She arrived at Piraeus on 18 February 1990 after being bought by Greek owners for a new service which never materialised and the ship was laid up, name unchanged. She was sold for scrap and arrived at Alang for demolition on 7 May 1996 which commenced on 23 September 1996.

<text>The National Defence Party () was an Icelandic political movement which operated from 1902 to 1912, founded because of discontentedness with a clause in the Icelandic constitution that stated that the Icelandic minister should bring up cases in the Danish Council of State. The clause was in the constitution from 1903 to 1915, at which point the Danish king ordered that it should be removed.

The founders of Landvarnarflokkurinn, who included Einar Benediktsson, Bjarni Jónsson and Jón Jensson, were the most radical fighters for Iceland&#x27;s independence of that time.

<text>RFA &quot;Stromness&quot; (A344) was a fleet stores ship which served the Royal Fleet Auxiliary until sold to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command in 1983. While in the service of British forces, it saw service in the Falklands War. After the sale to the United States, it was renamed USNS &quot;Saturn&quot; (T-AFS-10) and acted as a combat stores ship until it was deactivated in 2009; it was able to supply two other ships at once. In 2010, it was sunk in an exercise by the U.S. Carrier Strike Group Two off the coast of North Carolina.

==Construction==
Originally known as RFA &quot;Stromness&quot; (A344), the vessel was built at Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Ltd, Wallsend as Yard Nr 2017, United Kingdom, for the Royal Navy. She was laid down on 5 October 1965 and launched on 16 September 1966.

== RFA operational history ==
In 1973 she brought the expedition members of the Joint Services Egmont Islands Expedition (JSEI) from the Egmont Atoll back to Gan, Addu Atoll after their mission was over. Led by Sqn Leader &quot;Dickie&quot; Bird RAF, it was the first scuba diving expedition in the Chagos Archipelago. Following its success, a second expedition was undertaken to Danger Island the following year.

In 1982, &quot;Stromness&quot; saw service during the Falklands War, where she carried over 400 troops of 45 Commando Royal Marines to the beach landing in San Carlos Water.

==Sale to the U.S. Navy==
In 1983 &quot;Stromness&quot; was sold to the United States Navy. She was placed into non-commissioned service with Military Sealift Command and renamed USNS &quot;Saturn&quot; (T-AFS-10).

==Military Sealift Command Mission ==
&quot;Saturn&quot; was one of five combat stores ships operated by Military Sealift Command. She provided fuel, food, ammunition and ocean towing services to U.S. Navy ships around the world. &quot;Saturn&quot; carried virtually every type of food and supply needed by Navy ships. &quot;Saturn&quot; carried spare and repair parts for other ships and aircraft and also had a limited capability to transfer fuel to other Navy ships at sea. Supplies and fuel are transferred to other ships using lines and hoses suspended above the water to another ship as the ships move forward at the same speed and sometimes less than 50 feet apart.
&quot;Saturn&quot; was capable of replenishing two ships at the same time, one on either side, using this side-by-side technique. Dry stores were also transferred by using helicopters to lift large cargo nets and pallets loaded with supplies and parts. &quot;Saturn&quot; had elevators and mobile equipment for handling stores internally on the ship. Helicopters were not assigned to &quot;Saturn&quot; on a full-time basis, but flew aboard for extended periods of time while the ship was at sea.

Civilian Mariners (CIVMARS) on board USNS &quot;Saturn&quot; were a vital part of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Fleet. Their areas of expertise encompass a wide variety of occupations ranging primarily from the engineering, deck and supply departments. Final complement was approximately 120 personnel. Tour lengths were 4 months in duration with an extension option available.

Enlisted ratings on board included Operations Specialists, Information Systems Technicians, Electronics Technicians, Personnelmen and Storekeepers. Final tour length for enlisted military members aboard &quot;Saturn&quot; was 12 months. Officers served up to a two-year tour.

==&quot;Saturn&quot; operational history==
The &quot;Saturn&quot; was deactivated on 6 April 2009 and sunk as a target ship for weapons in a sinking exercise (SINKEX) by ships and aircraft of the George H.W. Bush Carrier Strike Group off the coast of North Carolina on 27 October 2010.

&quot;Hebe&quot; was severely damaged by a fire while at Gibraltar on 30 November 1978. The charter was cancelled and the ship returned to her owners. &quot;Hebe&quot; was renamed Good Guardian in June 1979, and sailed from Gibraltar on 13 June 1979 for repairs in Greece. She was renamed Guardian in 1981, and Wafa in 1987. The ship arrived at Famagusta for demolition on 16 September 1987.

<text>RFA &quot;Empire Gull (L3513) was a [[landing ship, tank]] of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]]. She was familiarly known as the &quot;Black Pig&quot; and was one of the last serving British LSTs. She was built as LST 3523, one of the [[Empire Ship]]s, and later commissioned asHMS &quot;Trouncer. During the Suez Crisis she was pressed into Government service as SS &quot;Empire Gull. In 1970 she was transferred to the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] asRFA &quot;Empire Gull, serving for ten years before being scrapped.

<text>Game Informer (GI was an American monthly video game magazine featuring articles, news, strategy, and reviews of video games and game consoles. It debuted in August 1991, when the video game retailer FuncoLand started publishing an in-house newsletter. It was acquired by the retailer GameStop, which bought FuncoLand in 2000. Due to this, a large amount of promotion was done in-store, which contributed to the success of the magazine. As of June 2017, it was the fifth-most popular magazine by copies circulated.

In August 2024, GameStop discontinued &quot;Game Informer&quot; after 33 years of publication and 368 issues. The associated website was also shut down with its digital archive removed.

==History==

===Magazine===
&quot;Game Informer&quot; debuted in August 1991. It was published every two months until November 1994, when the magazine began to be released monthly.

Since 2001 &quot;Game Informer&quot; has been published by Cathy Preston, who has been working as part of the production team since 2000. It was under her that the publication became an integral part of GameStop&#x27;s customer loyalty program, Power Up Rewards. In 2020, Preston retired from &quot;Game Informer&quot; after 20 years leaving a lasting legacy. Mary Lugones took over the role as publisher for &quot;Game Informer&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Game Informer&quot; became the 5th largest magazine in the US with 5 million copies sold, ahead of popular publications like &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and &quot;Playboy&quot;. By 2011, &quot;Game Informer&quot; had become the 3rd largest magazine in the US, topping 8 million copies circulated. However, in 2014 it had fallen to 4th place with 6.9 million copies sold. Figures in 2017 placed the magazine at 4th place with over 7 million copies sold. The financial success of &quot;Game Informer&quot; has been attributed to its good relationship with publishers, ties to GameStop, and the lack of gaming-magazine competition.

The April edition of &quot;Game Informer&quot; includes &#x27;an annual feature &quot;Game Infarcer&quot;, an April Fools&#x27; Day prank. In the cover box head appears &quot;World&#x27;s #1 Pretend Magazine&quot; where would ordinarily appear &quot;World&#x27;s #1 Video Game Magazine&quot; -- &quot;Parody&quot; is found at the cover bottom. &quot;Game Infarcer&quot; articles are accredited to the fictional editor-in-chief Darth Clark, who is addressed in hate mail every year sent to &quot;Game Informer&quot;. The heated responses to parody articles are often featured in later &quot;Game Informer&quot; issues.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; has included four &quot;Sacred Cow Barbecues&quot;. Similar in style to a celebrity roast, the occasion is meant to &quot;knock some of gaming&#x27;s most revered icons off their high and mighty pedestals&quot;. The first &quot;Sacred Cow Barbecues&quot; featured in issue 158 (June 2006). Other issues featuring Sacred Cow Barbecues are: 183 (July 2008), 211 (November 2010), and 261 (January 2015). &quot;Sacred Cow Barbecues&quot; articles are considered controversial among those gamers who are not amused by their favorite games being mocked.

In August 2019, after months of declining financials for GameStop, about half of the current &quot;Game Informer&quot; staff were let go, part of the larger cut of more than 120 jobs by GameStop as part of the store&#x27;s effort to improve their financial performance. These included some staff members that had been working at &quot;Game Informer&quot; for over 10 years, some were out on vacation during the time of the layoff. As a result of the layoff, other &quot;Game Informer&quot; staff also left of their own will, including video editor Ben Hanson. Ben Hanson eventually started his own podcast called MinnMax, in the process recruiting some of the &quot;Game Informer&quot; staff that was laid off. In March 2020 there was again another set of layoffs at &quot;Game Informer&quot;, this time not affecting editors but instead people who worked in other departments of &quot;Game Informer&quot;.

In late June 2020, longtime editor-in-chief and founder Andy McNamara announced he was leaving &quot;Game Informer&quot;, to be the Global Director of Integrated Comms for Shooters &amp; Star Wars at Electronic Arts, and that former senior editor Andrew Reiner would be taking his place as editor-in-chief. McNamara, who had at the time stopped reviewing games for &quot;Game Informer&quot;, instead focused solely on writing stories and behind the scenes work, came back to give his final review, &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;. After leaving &quot;Game Informer&quot;, he eventually said that the layoffs had a big impact on his decision to move on.

On November 4, 2021, the official website announced that every issue from then on would have a small print run variant known as Game Informer Gold. This version uses high quality paper and an alternate cover and is limited to 50 copies. The first copy was given away on November 6 for their Extra Life charity livestream.

In the summer of 2022, three more &quot;Game Informer&quot; staff were laid off: John Carson, Wesley LeBlanc, and Creative Director Jeff Akervik, who had worked at the publication for over 14 years. Andrew Reiner left &quot;Game Informer&quot; in September 2022 to become a game developer, thus leaving &quot;Game Informer&quot; with no original staff. Matt Miller, who has worked at &quot;Game Informer&quot; since 2004, was promoted to editor-in-chief. In Fall 2022, Kyle Hilliard (who was previously laid off) returned.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; launched a new print magazine subscription, standalone from GameStop&#x27;s Power Up Rewards, in March 2024. The program, which launched at a special annual price of $19.91 (commemorating the company&#x27;s founding year), offers 10 print issues per year and digital magazine access.

On August 2, 2024, GameStop leadership abruptly shuttered the publication and laid off its staff. The publication&#x27;s website was replaced with a static &quot;farewell&quot; page, making old articles unreadable. The July 2024 issue was its 368th and final issue. Current and former staff bemoaned the sudden closure. Morgan Park of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; reported that GameStop announced the shutdown publicly on the &quot;Game Informer&quot; X account, however, the &quot;&quot;Game Informer&quot; staff suggested they had nothing to do with the brief, cringey statement that reads like ChatGPT output&quot;. Park highlighted that the &quot;Game Informer&quot; X account went briefly active on August 5, 2024 when &quot;a former &quot;Game Informer&quot; staffer seemingly took the reins one last time to share a proper farewell&quot; which included images of the &quot;Game Informer&quot; masthead; after this farewell was posted, the &quot;Game Informer&quot; X account was wiped and &quot;no longer exists, just like the website. It seems GameStop didn&#x27;t appreciate &quot;Game Informer&quot; wanting to go out on its own terms&quot;. &quot;Aftermath&quot; then published a roundup from former &quot;Game Informer&quot; staff to eulogize the magazine in their own words.

===Website===
&quot;Game Informer Online&quot; was originally launched in August 1996 and featured daily news updates as well as articles. Justin Leeper and Matthew Kato were hired on in November 1999 as full-time web editors. As part of the GameStop purchase of the magazine, this original GameInformer.com site was closed around January 2001. Both Leeper and Kato were eventually placed on the editorial staff of the magazine.

&quot;GI Online&quot; was revived, at the same domain name, in September 2003, with a full redesign and many additional features, such as a review database, frequent news updates, and exclusive &quot;Unlimited&quot; content for subscribers. It was managed by Billy Berghammer, creator of PlanetGameCube.com (now known as NintendoWorldReport.com). Berghammer is currently the editor-in-chief at EGM Media Group 

In March 2009, the online staff began creating the code for what would be the latest redesign to date. The redesign was to release hand-in-hand with the magazine&#x27;s own redesign. On October 1, 2009, the newly redesigned website was live, with a welcome message from Editor-In-Chief Andy McNamara. Many new features were introduced, including a rebuilt media player, a feed highlighting the site activity of the website&#x27;s users, and the ability to create user reviews. At the same time, the magazine&#x27;s podcast, &quot;The Game Informer Show&quot;, was launched.

Each year, in January or February, &quot;Game Informer&quot;&#x27;s editors count and judge the &quot;Top 50 Games of [last year]&quot;. The games are sorted in order of release date. They do not have rankings, but they do commemorate special games with awards like Game of the Year and other examples. They also have top ten charts of differing categories, both in the &quot;Top 50&quot; section of the website and in the regular magazine.

In August each year, &quot;Game Informer&quot; included an &quot;E3 Hot 50&quot;, a special section that reviews the year&#x27;s E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) and most to all of its games, which also temporarily replaces the &quot;Previews&quot; section of the print edition.

When the magazine folded in 2024, the website&#x27;s content was deleted and replaced with a splash page announcing the closure for any links to the website. &quot;Aftermath&quot; reported that there are independent archival projects &quot;in the works&quot;.

===Australian edition===
In November 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; was launched in Australia by former Australian &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;Gameplayer&quot; and &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot; editor Chris Stead and publisher Citrus Media. By June 2010, &quot;Game Informer Australia&quot; had become the first local games publication to pass 10,000 subscribers. By August 18, 2010, it had become Australia&#x27;s biggest-selling video games publication.

&quot;Game Informer Australia&quot; was closed down on April 18, 2019, as a result of cost-cutting measures from its publishing company EB Games Australia.

&quot;GI Australia&quot; editor David Milner noted on Twitter that despite the fact that &quot;readership was up 19% over the last year&quot;, that &quot;Recent ad sales, however, did not really reflect this&quot;; he also noted the failed attempt at EB Games Australia&#x27;s corporate parent GameStop to find a buyer after months on the market, causing their shares to drop.

==Reviews==
&quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewed games since the early 16 bit era. At the time of their closing, they reviewed games on PCs; consoles including PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation VR, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch; and mobile devices running Android and iOS. &quot;Game Informer&quot; used to give separate reviews of the same game for each console for which that game was released; starting in the mid-2000s, &quot;GI&quot; has published just one consolidated review for the game, while provides notes on the and of each version. Older games, three per issue, were given brief reviews in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Classic GI&quot; section (compared with the game&#x27;s original review score, if one exists). This was discontinued in 2009, months before the redesign of the magazine. The magazine&#x27;s staff rate games on a scale of 1 to 10 with quarter-point intervals. A score of 1 to 5 is considered terrible (in many issues, 1 is noted as a joke reason for the score, for instance, &quot;Duplicates in lootboxes&quot; in issue 295); 6 to 7 is &quot;average&quot;, a decently playable, and sometimes fun (but flawed) game; and 10 is a rare, &quot;outstanding&quot;, nearly perfect game.

<doc id="527130" wikidata="Q863057" url="?curid=527130" title="Billy Collins">
<text>William James Collins (born March 22, 1941) is an American poet who served as the Poet Laureate of the United States from 2001 to 2003. He was a Distinguished Professor at Lehman College of the City University of New York, retiring in 2016. Collins was recognized as a Literary Lion of the New York Public Library (1992) and selected as the New York State Poet for 2004 through 2006. In 2016, Collins was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. As of 2020, he is a teacher in the MFA program at Stony Brook Southampton.

==Early life and education==
Collins was born in Manhattan to William and Katherine Collins and grew up in Queens and White Plains. William was born to a large family from Ireland and Katherine was from Canada. His mother, Katherine Collins, was a nurse who stopped working to raise the couple&#x27;s only child. Mrs. Collins had the ability to recite verses on almost any subject, which she often did, and cultivated in her young son the love of words, both written and spoken. Billy Collins&#x27; father was a worker on Wall Street who Collins attributes as an inspiration to his humor.

Collins attended Archbishop Stepinac High School and received a B.A. in English from the College of the Holy Cross in 1963. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. in romantic poetry from the University of California, Riverside. His professors at Riverside included Victorian scholar and poet Robert Peters. There he came under the influence of contemporary poets like Karl Shapiro, Howard Nemerov and Reed Whittemore, and during his adolescence he was influenced by Beat Generation poets as well. In 1975 Collins founded &quot;The Mid-Atlantic Review&quot; with his friends Walter Blanco and Steve Bailey.

==Career==
Collins is a Distinguished Professor of English at Lehman College in the Bronx, where he joined the faculty in 1968. He is a founding Advisory Board member of the CUNY Institute for Irish-American Studies at Lehman College. Collins has taught and served as a visiting writer at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York as well as teaching workshops across the U.S. and in Ireland. Collins is a member of the faculty of SUNY Stony Brook Southampton, where (2015) he teaches poetry workshops.

Collins was named U.S. Poet Laureate in 2001 and held the title until 2003. Collins served as Poet Laureate for the State of New York from 2004 until 2006. Collins served a stint with the Winter Park Institute in Winter Park, Florida, an affiliate of Rollins College. In 2012, Collins became Poetry Consultant for &quot;Smithsonian Magazine.&quot;

During the summer of 2013 Collins guest hosted Garrison Keillor&#x27;s popular daily radio broadcast, &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac,&quot; on NPR. Collins has been invited to read at The White House three times—in 2001, 2011, and 2014. In 2014 he traveled to Russia as a cultural emissary of the U.S. State Department. In 2013 and 2015, Collins toured with the singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, performing on stage with her in a music-poetry-conversation format. Collins and Paul Simon have engaged in four onstage conversations about poetry, music, and lyrics, starting in 2008. The conversations were held in 2008 at New York&#x27;s 92nd Street Y and The Winter Park Institute, in 2013 at the Chautauqua Institution, and in 2013 at Emory University as part of the Richard Ellman Lectures in Modern Literature, where Simon was the 2013 Richard Ellman Lecturer.

Collins presented a TED talk, &quot;Everyday moments, caught in time&quot; at TED 2012. Collins, as one of the Favorite 100 TED speakers of all time, was invited to give another TED talk at TED 2014 in Vancouver, Canada.

As U.S. Poet Laureate, Collins read his poem &quot;The Names&quot; at a special joint session of the United States Congress on September 6, 2002, held to remember the victims of the 9/11 attacks. Though, unlike their British counterparts, U.S. poets laureate are not asked or expected to write occasional poetry, Collins was asked by the Librarian of Congress to write a poem especially for that event. Collins initially refused to read &quot;The Names&quot; in public, though he has read it two times in public since 2002. He vowed not to include it in any of his books, refusing to capitalize on the 9/11 attacks. However, &quot;The Names&quot; was included in &quot;The Poets Laureate Anthology&quot; put out by the Library of Congress, for which Collins wrote the foreword. At the time the only book-published version of &quot;The Names&quot;, it contained a number of typographical errors. The poem also appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, September 6, 2002. Collins finally agreed to include &quot;The Names&quot; in his new and selected volume &quot;Aimless Love&quot; in 2013. As Poet Laureate, Collins instituted the program &quot;Poetry 180&quot; for high schools. Collins chose 180 poems for the program and the accompanying book, &quot;Poetry 180: A Turning Back to Poetry&quot;—one for each day of the school year. Collins edited a second anthology, &quot;180 More Extraordinary Poems for Every Day&quot; to refresh the supply of available poems.

In 1997, Collins recorded &quot;The Best Cigarette&quot;, a collection of 34 of his poems, that would become a bestseller. In 2005, the CD was re-released under a Creative Commons license, allowing free, non-commercial distribution of the recording. He also recorded two of his poems for the audio versions of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s collection &quot;Good Poems&quot; (2002). Collins has appeared on Keillor&#x27;s radio show, &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, numerous times, where he gained a portion of his large following. In 2005, Collins recorded &quot;Billy Collins Live: A Performance&quot; in New York City. Collins was introduced by his friend, actor Bill Murray.Collins has been called &quot;The most popular poet in America&quot; by the &quot;New York Times.&quot; When he moved from the University of Pittsburgh Press to Random House, the advance he received shocked the poetry world—a six-figure sum for a three-book deal, virtually unheard of in poetry. The deal secured for Collins through his literary agent, Chris Calhoun, then of Sterling Lord Literistic, with the editor Daniel Menaker, remained the talk of the poetry world, and indeed the literary world, for quite some time.

Over the years, the U.S. magazine &quot;Poetry&quot; has awarded Collins several prizes in recognition of poems they publish. During the 1990s, Collins won five such prizes. The magazine also selected him as &quot;Poet of the Year&quot; in 1994. In 2005 Collins was the first annual recipient of its Mark Twain Prize for Humor in Poetry. He has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts and in 1993, from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.

One of his most critically acclaimed works, &quot;Fishing on the Susquehanna in July&quot; has been added to the preserved works of the United States Native American literary registry as being deemed a culturally significant poem. The poem has been included on national Advance Placement exams for high school students.

In 2012, Collins appeared as himself in an episode of the PBS animated series &quot;Martha Speaks&quot;.

Collins is on the editorial board at &quot;The Alaska Quarterly Review&quot;. Most recently he contributed to the 30th anniversary edition. He is on the advisory board at the &quot;Southern Review&quot; and is similarly named in other journals.

During the stay-at-home confinement period necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in March 2020, Collins, like many others in the arts, appears daily on Facebook Live offering his art to a worldwide audience, reading poems and talking about poetry.

==Personal life==
In 1977 Collins married Diane Olbright, and later settled in Westchester County, New York. The couple have since divorced. Collins moved in 2007 from New York to Winter Park, Florida, to be with Suzannah Gilman, his fiancée, an attorney and fellow poet. Collins and Suzannah Gilman married on July 21, 2019, in Southampton, New York.

<text>An interreligious organization or [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] organization is an organization that encourages dialogue and cooperation between the world&#x27;s different religions. In 1893, the Parliament of the Worlds Religions held, in conjunction with the World Colombian Exposition, a conference held in Chicago that is believed to be the first interfaith gathering of notable significance. In the century since, many local, national and international organizations have been founded.

<doc id="527135" wikidata="Q2344210" url="?curid=527135" title="Louise Glück">
<text>Louise Elisabeth Glück ( ; April 22, 1943 – October 13, 2023) was an American poet and essayist. She won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature, whose judges praised &quot;her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal&quot;. Her other awards include the Pulitzer Prize, National Humanities Medal, National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, and Bollingen Prize. From 2003 to 2004, she was Poet Laureate of the United States.

Glück was born in New York City and raised on Long Island. She began to suffer from anorexia nervosa while in high school and later overcame the illness. She attended Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University but did not obtain a degree. In addition to being an author, she taught poetry at several academic institutions.

Glück is often described as an autobiographical poet; her work is known for its emotional intensity and for frequently drawing on mythology or nature imagery to meditate on personal experiences and modern life. Thematically, her poems have illuminated aspects of trauma, desire, and nature. In doing so, they have become known for frank expressions of sadness and isolation. Scholars have also focused on her construction of poetic personas and the relationship, in her poems, between autobiography and classical myth.

Glück served as the Frederick Iseman Professor in the Practice of Poetry at Yale University and as a professor of English at Stanford University. She split her time between Cambridge, Massachusetts; Montpelier, Vermont; and Berkeley, California.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Louise Glück was born in New York City on April 22, 1943. She was the elder of two surviving daughters of Daniel Glück, a businessman, and Beatrice Glück (née Grosby), a homemaker.

Glück&#x27;s mother was of Russian Jewish descent. Her paternal grandparents, Terézia (née Moskovitz) and Henrik Glück, were Hungarian Jews from Érmihályfalva, Bihar County, in what was then the Kingdom of Hungary, Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Romania); her grandfather ran a timber company called &quot;Feldmann és Glück&quot;. They emigrated to the United States in December 1900 and eventually owned a grocery store in New York. Glück&#x27;s father, who was born in the United States, had an ambition to become a writer, but went into business with his brother-in-law. Together, they achieved success when they invented the X-Acto knife. Glück&#x27;s mother was a graduate of Wellesley College. In her childhood, Glück&#x27;s parents taught her Greek mythology and classic stories such as the life of Joan of Arc. She began to write poetry at an early age.

As a teenager, Glück developed anorexia nervosa, which became the defining challenge of her late teenage and young adult years. She described the illness, in one essay, as the result of an effort to assert her independence from her mother. Elsewhere, she connected her illness to the death of an elder sister, an event that occurred before she was born. During the fall of her senior year at George W. Hewlett High School, in Hewlett, New York, she began psychoanalytic treatment. A few months later, she was taken out of school in order to focus on her rehabilitation, although she still graduated in 1961. Of that decision, she wrote, &quot;I understood that at some point I was going to die. What I knew more vividly, more viscerally, was that I did not want to die&quot;. She spent the next seven years in therapy, which she credited with helping her to overcome the illness and teaching her how to think.

As a result of her condition, Glück did not enroll in college as a full-time student. She described her decision to forgo higher education in favor of therapy as necessary: &quot;… my emotional condition, my extreme rigidity of behavior and frantic dependence on ritual made other forms of education impossible&quot;. Instead, she took a poetry class at Sarah Lawrence College and, from 1963 to 1966, she enrolled in poetry workshops at Columbia University&#x27;s School of General Studies, which offered courses for non-degree students. While there, she studied with Léonie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. She credited these teachers as significant mentors in her development as a poet.

===Career===
While attending poetry workshops, Glück began to publish her poems. Her first publication was in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, followed soon after by poems in &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and other venues. After leaving Columbia, Glück supported herself with secretarial work. She married Charles Hertz Jr. in 1967. In 1968, Glück published her first collection of poems, &quot;Firstborn&quot;, which received some positive critical attention. In a review, the poet Robert Hass described the book as &quot;hard, artful, and full of pain&quot;. However, reflecting on it in 2003, the critic Stephanie Burt said the collection &quot;revealed a forceful but clotted poet, an anxious imitator of Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath&quot;. Following the publication, Glück experienced a prolonged case of writer&#x27;s block, which was not cured, she said, until 1971, when she began to teach poetry at Goddard College in Vermont. The poems she wrote during this time were collected in her second book, &quot;The House on Marshland&quot; (1975), which many critics have regarded as her breakthrough work, signaling her &quot;discovery of a distinctive voice&quot;.

In 1973, Glück gave birth to a son, Noah, with her partner, Keith Monley, who helped raise him for the first two years of his life. Her marriage to Charles Hertz, Jr. had ended in divorce, and in 1977 she married John Dranow, an author who had started the summer writing program at Goddard College. In 1980, Dranow and Francis Voigt, the husband of poet Ellen Bryant Voigt, co-founded the New England Culinary Institute as a private, for-profit college. Glück and Bryant Voigt were early investors in the institute and served on its board of directors.

In 1980, Glück&#x27;s third collection, &quot;Descending Figure&quot;, was published. It received some criticism for its tone and subject matter: for example, the poet Greg Kuzma accused Glück of being a &quot;child hater&quot; for her now anthologized poem, &quot;The Drowned Children&quot;. On the whole, however, the book was well received. In &quot;The American Poetry Review&quot;, Mary Kinzie praised the book&#x27;s illumination of &quot;deprived, harmed, stammering beings&quot;. Writing in &quot;Poetry&quot;, the poet and critic J. D. McClatchy said the book was &quot;a considerable advance on Glück&#x27;s previous work&quot; and &quot;one of the year&#x27;s outstanding books&quot;. That same year, a fire destroyed Glück&#x27;s house in Vermont, resulting in the loss of most of her possessions.

In the wake of that tragedy, Glück began to write the poems that would later be collected in her award-winning work, &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; (1985). Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the author and critic Liz Rosenberg described the collection as &quot;clearer, purer, and sharper&quot; than Glück&#x27;s previous work. The critic Peter Stitt, writing in &quot;The Georgia Review&quot;, declared that the book showed Glück to be &quot;among the important poets of our age&quot;. From the collection, the poem &quot;Mock Orange&quot;, which has been likened to a feminist anthem, has been called an &quot;anthology piece&quot; because of its frequent inclusion in poetry anthologies and college courses.

In 1984, Glück joined the faculty of Williams College in Massachusetts as a senior lecturer in the English Department. The following year, her father died. The loss prompted her to begin a new collection of poems, &quot;Ararat&quot; (1990), the title of which references the mountain of the Genesis flood narrative. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2012, the critic Dwight Garner called it &quot;the most brutal and sorrow-filled book of American poetry published in the last 25 years&quot;. Glück followed this collection with one of her most popular and critically acclaimed books, &quot;The Wild Iris&quot; (1992), which features garden flowers in conversation with a gardener and a deity about the nature of life. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; proclaimed it an &quot;important book&quot; that showcased &quot;poetry of great beauty&quot;. The critic Elizabeth Lund, writing in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, called it &quot;a milestone work&quot;. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1993, cementing Glück&#x27;s reputation as a preeminent American poet.

While the 1990s brought Glück literary success, it was also a period of personal hardship. Her marriage to John Dranow ended in divorce in 1996, the difficult nature of which affected their business relationship, resulting in Dranow&#x27;s removal from his positions at the New England Culinary Institute. Glück channeled her experience into her writing, entering a prolific period of her career. In 1994, she published a collection of essays called &quot;Proofs &amp; Theories: Essays on Poetry&quot;. She then produced &quot;Meadowlands&quot; (1996), a collection of poetry about the nature of love and the deterioration of a marriage. She followed it with two more collections: &quot;Vita Nova&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Seven Ages&quot; (2001).

In 2004, in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Glück published a chapbook entitled &quot;October&quot;. Consisting of one poem divided into six parts, it draws on ancient Greek myth to explore aspects of trauma and suffering. That same year, she was named the Rosenkranz Writer in Residence at Yale University.

After joining the faculty of Yale, Glück continued to publish poetry. Her books published during this period include &quot;Averno&quot; (2006), &quot;A Village Life&quot; (2009), and &quot;Faithful and Virtuous Night&quot; (2014). In 2012, the publication of a collection of a half-century&#x27;s worth of her poems, entitled &quot;Poems: 1962–2012&quot;, was called &quot;a literary event&quot;. Another collection of her essays, entitled &quot;American Originality&quot;, appeared in 2017.

In October 2020, Glück was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, becoming the sixteenth female literature laureate since the prize was founded in 1901. Due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, she received her prize at her home. In her Nobel lecture, which was delivered in writing, she highlighted her early engagement with poetry by William Blake and Emily Dickinson in discussing the relationship between poets, readers, and the wider public.

In 2021, Glück&#x27;s collection, &quot;Winter Recipes from the Collective&quot;, was published. In 2022, she was named the Frederick Iseman Professor in the Practice of Poetry at Yale. In 2023, she was appointed a professor of English at Stanford University, where she taught in the Creative Writing Program.

=== Personal life ===
Glück&#x27;s elder sister died young before Glück was born. Her younger sister, Tereze (1945–2018), worked at Citibank as a vice president and was also a writer, winning the Iowa Short Fiction Award in 1995 for her book, &quot;May You Live in Interesting Times&quot;. Glück&#x27;s niece is the actress Abigail Savage.

She remained a close confidant and friend to Vermont novelist Kathryn Davis throughout her life. The two often corresponded to share their developing works, seeking creative advice throughout their lengthy friendship and writing careers. 

Glück died from cancer at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 13, 2023, at age 80.

== Work ==
Glück&#x27;s work has been the subject of academic study. Her papers, including manuscripts, correspondence, and other materials, are housed at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.

=== Form ===
Glück is best known for lyric poems of linguistic precision and dark tone. The poet Craig Morgan Teicher has described her as a writer for whom &quot;words are always scarce, hard won, and not to be wasted&quot;. The scholar Laura Quinney has argued that her careful use of words put Glück into &quot;the line of American poets who value fierce lyric compression&quot;, from Emily Dickinson to Elizabeth Bishop. Glück&#x27;s poems shifted in form throughout her career, beginning with short, terse lyrics composed of compact lines and expanding into connected book-length sequences. Her work is not known for poetic techniques such as rhyme or alliteration. Rather, the poet Robert Hahn has called her style &quot;radically inconspicuous&quot; or &quot;virtually an absence of style&quot;, relying on a voice that blends &quot;portentous intonations&quot; with a conversational approach.

Among scholars and reviewers, there has been discussion as to whether Glück is a confessional poet, owing to the prevalence of the first-person mode in her poems and their intimate subject matter, often inspired by events in Glück&#x27;s personal life. The scholar Robert Baker has argued that Glück &quot;is surely a confessional poet in some basic sense&quot;, while the critic Michael Robbins has argued that Glück&#x27;s poetry, unlike that of confessional poets Sylvia Plath or John Berryman, &quot;depends upon the fiction of privacy&quot;. In other words, she cannot be a confessional poet, Robbins argues, if she does not address an audience. Going further, Quinney argues that, to Glück, the confessional poem is &quot;odious&quot;. Others have noted that Glück&#x27;s poems can be viewed as autobiographical, while her technique of inhabiting various personas, ranging from ancient Greek gods to garden flowers, renders her poems more than mere confessions. As the scholar Helen Vendler has noted: &quot;In their obliquity and reserve, [Glück&#x27;s poems] offer an alternative to first-person &#x27;confession&#x27;, while remaining indisputably personal&quot;.

=== Themes ===
While Glück&#x27;s work is thematically diverse, scholars and critics have identified several themes that are paramount. Most prominently, Glück&#x27;s poetry can be said to focus on trauma, as she wrote throughout her career about death, loss, suffering, failed relationships, and attempts at healing and renewal. The scholar Daniel Morris notes that even a Glück poem that uses traditionally happy or idyllic imagery &quot;suggests the author&#x27;s awareness of mortality, of the loss of innocence&quot;. The scholar Joanne Feit Diehl echoes this notion when she argues that &quot;this &#x27;sense of an ending&#x27; … infuses Glück&#x27;s poems with their retrospective power&quot;, pointing to her transformation of common objects, such as a baby stroller, into representations of loneliness and loss. Yet, for Glück, trauma was arguably a gateway to a greater appreciation of life, a concept explored in &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot;. The triumph to which the title alludes is Achilles&#x27; acceptance of mortality—which enables him to become a more fully realized human being.

Another of Glück&#x27;s common themes is desire. Glück wrote directly about many forms of desire—for example, the desire for love or insight—but her approach is marked by ambivalence. Morris argues that Glück&#x27;s poems, which often adopt contradictory points of view, reflect &quot;her own ambivalent relationship to status, power, morality, gender, and, most of all, language&quot;. The author Robert Boyer has characterized Glück&#x27;s ambivalence as a result of &quot;strenuous self-interrogation&quot;. He argues that &quot;Glück&#x27;s poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection … for a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion&quot;. The tension between competing desires in Glück&#x27;s work manifests both in her assumption of different personas from poem to poem and in her varied approach to each collection of her poems. This led the poet and scholar James Longenbach to declare that &quot;change is Louise Glück&#x27;s highest value&quot; and &quot;if change is what she most craves, it is also what she most resists, what is most difficult for her, most hard-won&quot;.

Another of Glück&#x27;s preoccupations was nature, the setting for many of her poems. In &quot;The Wild Iris&quot;, the poems take place in a garden where flowers have intelligent, emotive voices. However, Morris points out that &quot;The House on Marshland&quot; is also concerned with nature and can be read as a revision of the Romantic tradition of nature poetry. In &quot;Ararat&quot;, too, &quot;flowers become a language of mourning&quot;, useful for both commemoration and competition among mourners to determine the &quot;ownership of nature as a meaningful system of symbolism&quot;. Thus, in Glück&#x27;s work nature is both something to be regarded critically and embraced. The author and critic Alan Williamson has said it can also sometimes suggest the divine, as when, in the poem &quot;Celestial Music&quot;, the speaker states that &quot;when you love the world you hear celestial music&quot;, or when, in &quot;The Wild Iris&quot;, the deity speaks through changes in weather.

Glück&#x27;s poetry is also notable for what it avoids. Morris argues that

=== Influences ===
Glück pointed to the influence of psychoanalysis on her work, as well as her early learning in ancient legends, parables, and mythology. In addition, she credited the influence of Léonie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Scholars and critics have pointed to the literary influence on her work of Robert Lowell, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Emily Dickinson, among others.

==Honors==
Glück received numerous honors for her work. Below are honors she received for both her body of work and individual works.

In 1999, Glück, along with the poets Rita Dove and W. S. Merwin, was asked to serve as a special consultant to the Library of Congress for that institution&#x27;s bicentennial. In this capacity, she helped the Library of Congress to determine programming to mark its 200th anniversary celebration. In 1999, she was also elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, a post she held until 2005. In 2003, she was appointed the judge of the Yale Series of Younger Poets, a position she held until 2010. The Yale Series is the oldest annual literary competition in the United States, and during her time as judge, she selected for publication works by the poets Jay Hopler, Peter Streckfus, and Fady Joudah, among others.

Glück was a visiting faculty member at many institutions, including Stanford University, Boston University, the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, and the Iowa Writers Workshop.

<text>RFA &quot;Cherryleaf&quot; (A82) was a Leaf-class fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

Launched in 1953 as &quot;Laurelwood&quot;, the ship was acquired by the RFA, and renamed &quot;Cherryleaf&quot; in 1959.

In 1966 the ship was returned to her previous owners and renamed &quot;Agios Constantinos&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Aeas&quot; in 1967, and as &quot;Irene&#x27;s Fortune&quot; in 1972. She was scrapped on 13 December 1975.

<text>[[Northumbria]], a kingdom of Angles, in what is now northern England and south-east Scotland, was initially divided into two kingdoms: Bernicia and Deira. The two were first united by King Æthelfrith around the year 604, and except for occasional periods of division over the subsequent century, they remained so. The exceptions are during the brief period from 633 to 634, when Northumbria was plunged into chaos by the death of King Edwin in battle and the ruinous invasion of Cadwallon ap Cadfan, king of Gwynedd. The unity of the Northumbrian kingdoms was restored after Cadwallon&#x27;s death in battle in 634.

Another exception is a period from about the year 644 to 664, when kings ruled individually over Deira. In 651, King Oswiu had Oswine of Deira killed and replaced by Œthelwald, but Œthelwald did not prove to be a loyal sub-king, allying with the Mercian King Penda; according to Bede, Œthelwald acted as Penda&#x27;s guide during the latter&#x27;s invasion of Northumbria but withdrew his forces when the Mercians met the Northumbrians at the Battle of Winwaed. After the Mercian defeat at Winwaed, Œthelwald lost power and Oswiu&#x27;s own son, Alchfrith, became king in his place. In 670, Ælfwine, the brother of the childless king Ecgfrith, was made king of Deira; by this point the title may have been used primarily to designate an heir. Ælfwine was killed in battle against Mercia in 679, and there was not another separate king of Deira until the time of Norse rule.

==Kings of Bernicia==

==Kings of Deira==
==Kings of Northumbria==
==Rulers of the divided Northumbria==
Viking kings ruled Jórvík (southern Northumbria, the former Deira) from its capital York for most of the period between 867 and 954. Northern Northumbria (the former Bernicia) was ruled by Anglo-Saxons from their base in Bamburgh. Many details are uncertain as the history of Northumbria in the ninth and tenth centuries is poorly recorded.
Although Eadred claimed rule from 946, the Kingdom of Northumbria was not absorbed permanently into England until after 954. Thereafter Osulf had control of all Northumbria under Eadred. See Rulers of Bamburgh for subsequent lords of Bamburgh after Osulf, none of whom ruled as kings.

After the ascension of William the Conqueror in 1066, and in the prelude to the Harrying of the North, a joint Anglo-Danish force loyal to Edgar Ætheling and Sweyn II was able to seize control of York in the second half of 1069 and temporarily assert sovereignty over all of Northumbria. This short-lived independence came to an end when William fought his way North and paid off Sweyn to return to Denmark, leading to the Harrying of the North and the flight of Edgar and his family to Scotland.

<text>RFA &quot;Eddybeach&quot; (A132) was an &quot;Eddy&quot; class coastal tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary of the United Kingdom. The ship mainly saw service in the Mediterranean, quite often at Gibraltar where it functioned as a water carrier. In 1964 &quot;Eddybeach&quot; was disposed of by sale to Greece.

&quot;Eddybeach&quot; can be seen in the background during the scene depicting Lional &#x27;Buster&#x27; Crabb&#x27;s first dive in Gibraltar harbour in the film &quot;The Silent Enemy&quot; (1958).

<text>This is a list of destroyer classes of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, organised chronologically by entry into service.

== Torpedo boat destroyers ==
In 1913, the surviving members of the large heterogeneous array of older 27-knot and 30-knot torpedo boat destroyer types (all six of the original 26-knot ships had been disposed of by the end of 1912) were organised into the A, B, C and D classes according to their design speed and the number of funnels they possessed. All were of a &quot;turtle-back&quot; design and, excepting a few &quot;builder&#x27;s specials&quot;, powered by reciprocating engines. It should be stressed that these A to D class designations did not exist before 1913, and only applied to those &quot;turtle-backed&quot; destroyers surviving to that time.

After testing two vessels of an intermediate type, the design evolved into the &quot;Dithmarschen&quot;-class. Six were built altogether, one of which was never completed. As Germany did not possess any ports on the Atlantic Ocean or any overseas bases, the &quot;Dithmarschen&quot;-class combined the roles fulfilled by tanker, repair ship, ammunition ship and dry cargo ship. The ships were even equipped with a small hospital. The main cargo were almost 9,000 tons of fuel oil and 400 tons of lubricating oil. As it was probable that the ships were underway for an extended time, the range was at . The maximum speed was 23 knots. A heavy armament was fitted, consisting of three 15 cm/L48 guns, two 3,7 cm Flak and four 2 cm Flak anti-aircraft guns and eight machine guns.

==Construction==
The ship was laid down at the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Elbing East Prussia (now Elbląg, Poland) on 14 November 1936, and was launched on 5 October 1937 with the name &quot;Westerwald&quot;. and was completed on 6 January 1939.

She arrived at Rosyth on 8 August 1945 and the following month went to Hebburn-on-Tyne for survey and repairs and conversion for service with the British Pacific Fleet, but the war ended and she was placed in reserve instead. She was renamed Northmark in January 1946 and was considered as a Royal Fleet Auxiliary-manned oiler, but the cost of modifications was considered to be unjustifiable and a follow-up proposal was taken up after approval was given to operate her as a naval ship. She therefore never served as an RFA, but was refitted for service in 1947 and on completion was renamed HMS &quot;Bulawayo&quot; in July 1947. She served as such until she was scrapped in 1955.

Made redundant by the Communist victory in 1949, &quot;Changchow&quot; and her sistership &quot;Chungking&quot; (later ) were chartered to the French « Messageries Maritimes », for the Marseilles-Sydney line, via Panama.
Purchased by the Admiralty and chartered out to British India until 1957. 
In 1956-1957, under the name Resurgent, she was again chartered to the « Messageries Maritimes », making trips to New Caledonia and Australia. After that, she was converted to an armament store issuing ship and entered RFA service.

In 1975 she took part in the Joint Services Expedition to Danger Island (JSDI). Small, rocky, Resurgent Island, which had emerged after the naming of the Three Brothers in the 18th century, was named after the RFA &quot;Resurgent&quot; which supported the scuba diving scientific research expedition to the area.

She served until 1979, sailing from Rosyth in tow for demolition in Spain on 5 May 1981.

<text>Martin John Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow, (born 23 June 1942) is a British cosmologist and astrophysicist. He is the fifteenth Astronomer Royal, appointed in 1995, and was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, from 2004 to 2012 and President of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010. He has received various physics awards including the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2024 for fundamental contributions to high-energy astrophysics, galaxies and structure formation, and cosmology.

== Early life and education ==
Rees was born on 23 June 1942 in York, England. After a peripatetic life during the war his parents, both teachers, settled with Rees, an only child, in a rural part of Shropshire near the border with Wales. There, his parents founded Bedstone College, a boarding school based on progressive educational concepts. He was educated at Bedstone College, then from the age of 13 at Shrewsbury School. He studied for the mathematical tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with first class honours. He then undertook post-graduate research at Cambridge and completed a PhD supervised by Dennis Sciama in 1967. Rees&#x27; post-graduate work in astrophysics in the mid-1960s coincided with an explosion of new discoveries, with breakthroughs ranging from confirmation of the Big Bang, the discovery of neutron stars and black holes, and a host of other revelations.

==Career==
After holding postdoctoral research positions in the United Kingdom and the United States, he was a professor at Sussex University, during 1972–1973. He later moved to Cambridge, where he was the Plumian Professor at the University of Cambridge until 1991, and the director of the Institute of Astronomy.

He was professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, in 1975 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1979. From 1992 to 2003, he was Royal Society Research Professor, and from 2003 Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics. He was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, during 2004–2012. He is an Honorary Fellow of Darwin College, King&#x27;s College, Clare Hall, Robinson College and Jesus College, Cambridge.

Rees is a member of the Board of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and the Oxford Martin School. He co-founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and serves on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Future of Life Institute. He has formerly been a Trustee of the British Museum, the Science Museum, the Gates Cambridge Trust and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).

His doctoral students have included Roger Blandford, Craig Hogan, Nick Kaiser Priyamvada Natarajan, and James E. Pringle.

== Research ==
Rees is the author of more than 500 research papers. He is an author of books on astronomy and science intended for the lay public and gives many public lectures and broadcasts. In 2010 he was invited to deliver the Reith Lectures for the BBC, now published as &quot;From Here to Infinity: Scientific Horizons&quot;.

Rees has made contributions to the origin of cosmic microwave background radiation, as well as to galaxy clustering and formation. His studies of the distribution of quasars challenged the now-rejected steady state theory. He was one of the first to propose that enormous black holes power quasars, and that superluminal astronomical observations can be explained as an optical illusion caused by an object moving partly in the direction of the observer.

Since the 1990s, Rees has worked on gamma-ray bursts, especially in collaboration with Péter Mészáros, and on how the &quot;cosmic dark ages&quot; ended when the first stars formed. Since the 1970s he has been interested in anthropic reasoning, and the possibility that our visible universe is part of a vaster &quot;multiverse&quot;.

== Public engagement ==
In addition to expansion of his scientific interests, Rees has written and spoken extensively about the problems and challenges of the 21st century, and interfaces between science, ethics, and politics.

In his books &quot;Our Final Hour&quot; and &quot;On the Future&quot;, Rees warns that humanity faces significant existential risks in the 21st century due to technological advancements, particularly in bioengineering and artificial intelligence. Although he remains optimistic that if it is managed successfully, technology could drastically improve standards of living.

In 2007, he delivered the Gifford Lectures on &quot;21st Century Science: Cosmic Perspective and Terrestrial Challenges&quot; at the University of St Andrews. He made two TED talks on existential risks.

Rees thinks the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is worthwhile and has chaired the advisory board for the &quot;Breakthrough Listen&quot; project, a programme of SETI investigations funded by the Russian/US investor Yuri Milner.

In August 2014, Rees was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

To mark the 300th anniversary of the Board of Longitude in 2014, he instigated a programme of new challenge prizes of £5-10m under the name &quot;Longitude Prize 2014&quot; for which he chairs the advisory board. The themes of the first two prizes are the reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use, and enhancing the safety and independence of dementia sufferers. The Longitude Prize on Dementia was announced in 2022.

In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund coordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025.

In his general writings and in the House of Lords, his focus has been on the uses and abuses of advanced technology and on issues such as assisted dying, preservation of dark skies, and reforms to broaden the post-16 and undergraduate curricula in the UK. He is also a current member of the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee.

<doc id="527167" wikidata="Q1551154" url="?curid=527167" title="Half crown (British coin)">
<text>The British half crown was a denomination of sterling coinage worth of one pound, or two shillings and six pence (abbreviated &quot;2/6&quot;, familiarly &quot;two and six&quot;), or 30 pre-decimal pence. The half crown was first issued in England in 1549, in the reign of Edward VI, with a value half that of the crown coin. No half crowns were issued in the reign of Mary, but from the reign of Elizabeth I half crowns were issued in every reign except that of Edward VIII, until the coins were discontinued in 1970.

During the English Interregnum of 1649–1660, a republican half crown was issued, bearing the arms of the Commonwealth of England, despite monarchist associations of the coin&#x27;s name. When Oliver Cromwell was made Lord Protector of England, half crowns were issued bearing his portrait depicting him wearing a laurel wreath in the manner of a Roman Emperor. The half crown did not display its value on the reverse until 1893. In the 20th century a slang term for the coin was &quot;half-a-dollar&quot;.

The half crown was demonetised (ahead of other pre-decimal coins) on 1 January 1970, the year before the United Kingdom adopted decimal currency on Decimal Day.

== History of the half crown by reign ==
*King Henry VIII 1526: the first English half crown was struck in gold.
*King Edward VI 1551: issued the first half crown in silver. The coin was dated and showed the king riding a horse.
*Queen Mary I: the half crown was struck on Mary&#x27;s marriage to Philip II of Spain in 1554 but was never issued for circulation. Three specimens exist.
*Queen Elizabeth I: gold half crowns were issued again. At the end of the reign silver half crowns were issued.
*King James I: gold half crowns were issued again. During the reign silver half crowns were issued.
*King Charles I: silver half crowns were issued, including those struck as obsidional money, money of necessity during the Civil War period.
*Commonwealth of England: Oliver Cromwell silver half crowns were issued. During the years 1656 and 1658 milled half crowns were issued of Oliver Cromwell.
*King Charles II 1663–1685: silver half crowns were issued, and this period saw the end of the hammered issue of half crowns.
*King James II 1685–1688: silver half crown.
*King William III &amp; Queen Mary II 1689–1694: silver half crown.
*William III of England 1694–1702: silver half crown.
*Queen Anne 1702–1714: silver half crown.
*King George I 1714–1727: silver half crown.
*King George II 1727–1760: silver half crown.
*King George III 1760–1820: silver half crown.
*King George IV 1820–1830: silver half crown.
*King William IV 1830–1837: silver half crown.
*Queen Victoria 1837–1901: silver half crown.
*King Edward VII 1902–1910: silver half crown.
*King George V 1910–1936: silver half crown, sterling silver (92½% silver) until 1919, then 50% silver.
*King Edward VIII 1936: 50% silver half crown. Not issued for circulation.
*King George VI 1937–1952: 50% silver half crowns were issued until 1946 when the metal was changed to cupro-nickel.
*Queen Elizabeth II 1953–1967: the last half crown for general circulation was issued in 1967, and the coin was withdrawn in 1970, before decimalisation. Proof sets of £sd coins, including the half crown, were issued by the Royal Mint, bearing the date 1970.

== Size and weight ==
From 1816, in the reign of George III, half crown coins had a diameter of 32 mm and a weight of 14.14 grams (defined as  troy ounce), dimensions which remained the same for the half crown until decimalisation in 1971.

<text>Schizopolis (also known as Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s Schizopolis) is a 1996 surrealist experimental comedy film with a non-linear narrative written and directed by Steven Soderbergh.

==Plot==
Although the film does not have a linear plot, a structure exists, telling the same story from three different perspectives. At the beginning, Soderbergh speaks to the audience in a style meant to evoke Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s introduction to &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.

Fletcher Munson is an office employee working under Theodore Azimuth Schwitters, the leader of a self-help company known as Eventualism. The first part of the film is seen from Fletcher&#x27;s perspective, seeing the underlying meaning in everything. He pays more attention to meaning, rather than what is said. He shows less and less attention to other people, to the point where he comes home and communicates with his wife by describing what they are saying. When Fletcher&#x27;s co-worker Lester Richards dies, Fletcher takes his job as speechwriter. His personal life suffers because of this. He becomes more detached from his wife, who copes by having an affair.

Meanwhile, Elmo Oxygen, an exterminator, goes from house to house, bedding the housewives who work for Schwitters. In each house he takes pictures of his genitals using cameras he finds. Elmo and the women speak in a nonsensical code. Fletcher&#x27;s key will not work in his car door. He looks around to find that his actual car (parked two spots away) is an exact match for the one he is trying to get into. He goes to enter his car when he sees a man who is his exact double get into the car he just tried to enter. Fletcher follows his doppelgänger home, closes his eyes, and becomes him.

Next we follow Fletcher&#x27;s doppelgänger, Dr. Jeffrey Korchek, a dentist. He always wears a jogging suit. He is also a fan of Muzak, and is the mystery man that Fletcher&#x27;s wife has been sleeping with. Korchek suggests she leave Fletcher for him.

The next day, Korchek has breakfast with his heroin-addicted brother, who asks to stay with Korchek and for money. Korchek says that his brother should not be dealing with drug dealers and that he can get him drugs. Korchek goes to work, where he meets Attractive Woman Number 2, Mrs. Munson&#x27;s doppelgänger. Korchek falls instantly in love and writes her a letter professing such. He leaves the note and goes home, where he sees a car in the driveway. It is Mrs. Munson, who has left Fletcher. Korchek admits that he has fallen in love with someone else. Mrs. Munson is upset and leaves.

The next day Korchek gets to work and is confronted by a man who says &quot;Your brother, eight hours, fifteen thousand dollars.&quot; Almost all of his dialog consists of these three commands. Korchek goes into the office and finds a letter from a law firm representing Attractive Woman Number 2, who is filing a sexual harassment suit against him. He discovers that his brother has stolen all of his money. Korchek leaves work. Korchek is shot dead. A couple following Elmo approach him, to convince him to stop playing his role in the film, in order to become a star in an action show. Unlike the rest of the film, Elmo&#x27;s storyline moves forward in time.

Finally we see the perspective of Mrs. Munson. We move through the storyline, seeing her experiences with Fletcher and Dr. Korchek and being a mom. The events are the same but Fletcher and Korchek speak foreign languages, similar to the &quot;generic greetings&quot; from earlier. Once Mrs. Munson leaves Korchek, she reconciles with Fletcher and they go home. Fletcher finishes Schwitters&#x27; speech. Schwitters mounts the podium and gives the oration. After acknowledging applause with a &quot;Thank you,&quot; Elmo bursts in and shoots Schwitters in the shoulder. Schwitters survives and Elmo is arrested and interrogated.

In a shopping mall Fletcher narrates events from the rest of his life. Then, Soderbergh returns in front of a blank movie screen and asks if there are any questions. After offering several responses he walks offstage as the camera pulls back to reveal he&#x27;s been talking to an empty auditorium. The film has no beginning or end credits. A man clad only in a black T-shirt appears at the beginning and conclusion of the film, being chased by men in white coats through a field. In the beginning, the T-shirt sports the title of the film; later, it says &quot;The End.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Schizopolis&quot; was shot in Soderbergh&#x27;s hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana over a period of nine months, beginning in March 1995, on a budget of only $250,000. Due to Soderbergh&#x27;s desire to keep the film simple, many people had multiple duties (i.e. David Jensen played Elmo Oxygen as well as being the casting director and key grip) and many friends and relatives were hired in various capacities.

Betsy Brantley, who plays Mrs. Munson, is Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s ex-wife in real-life. Soderbergh himself took the lead role, instead of hiring a professional actor, in part because, as he said, &quot;There was just nobody I knew that I could make that demand of - come and work for free for nine months whenever I feel like it in Baton Rouge!&quot;

==Interpretations==
Several interpretations suggest that the film is exploring certain themes. One such theme is lack of communication: Munson and his wife only engage in templates of speech, such as &quot;Generic greeting!&quot; and &quot;Generic greeting returned!&quot; Another theme is the idea of social restraint versus internal thought: at Lester Richards&#x27; funeral, the priest begins the eulogy &quot;Lester Richards is dead, and aren&#x27;t you glad it wasn&#x27;t you?&quot; Interpretations differ greatly and the narrative jokes about its own apparent lack of meaning; at one point in the middle of the film a written message appears on a tree trunk stating &quot;IDEA MISSING.&quot;

==Reception==

===Release===
The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival as a film surprise on May 18, 1996, where it was poorly received. This prompted the filmmakers to add the Cecil B. DeMille inspired introduction and conclusion in the theater as a way to signal to the viewers that the film was &quot;ironical and self-serving&quot;. &quot;Schizopolis&quot; was given a limited theatrical release, as it was considered too odd for mainstream audiences. The film found an appreciative small audience and was included in the Criterion Collection, a specialist DVD distributor, which includes two audio commentaries, one of which consists of Soderbergh interviewing himself for the duration of the film.

===Critical reception===
Reviews of the film were mixed; it received a 63% rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, and a &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; descriptor at Metacritic. Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;Schizopolis&quot; was &quot;a truly inexplicable film...which had audiences filing out with sad, thoughtful faces&quot;. Leonard Maltin gave the film a more favorable rating of three stars out of four, and wrote in his &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;, &quot;A broad-ranging jab at modern society and its ills, its tone arch, its technique one of non sequiturs, and its audience likely to be small. But if you latch onto it early enough, you may find (as we did) that it&#x27;s fun — and funny — to watch.&quot;

&quot;Wave Chief&quot; was initially chartered out before she was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She was operating in the Mediterranean in 1947, when one of her firemen was discharged dead at Suez, Egypt. In 1949, she loaded a cargo at Abadan, Iran and delivered it to Sydney, Australia. On 25 June 1950, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; joined the United States Seventh Fleet for naval operations. On 18 November 1951, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; was refuelling off the coast of Korea when there was an accident which resulted in a large spill of fuel and damage to her rig.

On 27 July 1953, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; was awarded a battle honour for her service during the Korean War. During December 1956 and January 1957, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; accompanied during the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s tour of the southern oceans. From 1957, she took part in Operation Grapple X, the British hydrogen bomb tests at Christmas Island.

From November 1958, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; was deployed supporting Royal Navy ships in operations off Iceland in the First Cod War. These deployments continued until February 1961. In 1961, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; came to the assistance of the &quot;Haisboro Light Vessel&quot; which was sinking off the Norfolk coast after being in collision with another ship. From September to December 1965, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; accompanied , , and on a goodwill tour of South America. The squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Fitzroy Talbot, visited ports in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

On 25 April 1968, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; departed from Punta Arenas, Chile to rendezvous with the yacht &quot;Lively Lady&quot;, which was being sailed single-handedly around the world by Alec Rose. She escorted &quot;Lively Lady&quot; around Cape Horn, South America on 1 April. From 15 to 17 March 1973, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; assisted Icelandic Coast Guard, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy units in the unsuccessful search for survivors from the trawler &quot;Sjoestjaman&quot;.

From May to August 1973, &quot;Wave Chief&quot; operated in support of Royal Navy units involved in the Second Cod War. She was decommissioned in August 1974 and laid up at Rosyth, Dunbartonshire.

<text>A Dagwood sandwich is a tall, multilayered sandwich made with a variety of meats, cheeses, and condiments. It is named after Dagwood Bumstead, a central character in the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;, who is frequently illustrated making enormous sandwiches. According to &quot;Blondie&quot; scripter Dean Young, his father, Chic Young, began drawing the huge sandwiches in the comic strip in 1936.

==Ingredients==

Though the exact contents of Chic Young&#x27;s illustrated Dagwood sandwich remain obscure, it appears to contain large quantities and varieties of cold cuts, sliced cheese, and vegetables separated by additional slices of bread. A whole small fish, presumably a sardine, is usually visible. An olive pierced by a toothpick or wooden skewer usually crowns the edible structure. &quot;Dagwood sandwich&quot; has been included in &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;Dagwood&quot; (referring to the sandwich) has been included in the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;.

==Products and restaurants==
* In 1951, businessmen Bob Weiler and Art Lang opened a Dagwood-themed restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, with hopes of establishing a national chain. They had not licensed the Dagwood name and were ordered to stop using it by King Features.
* A Dagwood Diner (spelled &quot;Dag-Wood&quot;) operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, until 1971.
* Assorted lunch meats featuring Dagwood have been sold at grocery stores. In May 1999, a counter-service restaurant named Blondie&#x27;s opened at Universal Orlando&#x27;s Islands of Adventure, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. Blondie&#x27;s bills itself as &quot;Home of the Dagwood Sandwich.&quot; The exterior displays a 20-foot plastic Dagwood sandwich over the entrance.
* Denny&#x27;s in the early 2000s offered their breakfast Dagwood; it contained over a thousand calories. It was later removed from their menu.
* Dagwood&#x27;s Sandwich Shoppes, a &quot;Blondie&quot;-themed restaurant chain founded in 2006, had franchise locations open in Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia that have all closed as of 2011. The chain struggled financially and never reached the growth anticipated by its founders. Two lawsuits were filed alleging mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement, and deliberate deception of the chain&#x27;s financial state as it collapsed. The Dagwood was sold as a sandwich. The Dagwood sandwich served in the Dagwood Sandwich Shoppes included the following ingredients: three slices of deli bread, Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, red onion, deli mustard, and low calorie mayonnaise.
* Cincinnati-based chain Penn Station East Coast Subs refers to its &quot;create-it-yourself&quot; submarine sandwich as a Dagwood. A customer may include up to five meats, and any combination of available condiments and vegetables.
* Dagwoods are also a popular sandwich in South African takeaway (fast-food) restaurants and roadhouses, both in small street-side stands and larger chains. A South African Dagwood is usually made with three slices of toasted bread with a hamburger patty (or two), along with lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. Other common accoutrements may be added and the beef patty may be replaced by savory mince reminiscent of an American sloppy joe, but it seems to be the fried egg and double-decker nature of the sandwich that characterizes a South African Dagwood.
* In 2008, &quot;Man v. Food&quot; host Adam Richman visited Columbus, Ohio, and partook in the Ohio Deli and Restaurant&#x27;s Dagwood Challenge. The challenge was to eat a 2-1⁄2-pound Dagwood sandwich, plus a full pound of French fries, within 30 minutes. Richman successfully ate the sandwich and fries in 20 of the 30 minutes and was awarded a commemorative T-shirt.
*Dagwood&#x27;s Deli and Sub Shop opened in Indiana in 1985, now serving several locations. On the menu is a &quot;Dagwood Supreme&quot;, which includes roast beef, ham, turkey, provolone and Colby cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onions and a &quot;Dagwood&quot; sauce.
*Dagwoods Sandwichs et Salades is a fast-food chain operating in Canada. It was founded in 1989 in Montreal but subsequently expanded throughout Quebec and into Eastern Ontario.
*Canadian supermarket chain Sobeys sells an in-store made Dagwood sandwich, but this does not look like the multi-layered sandwiches from the comic and instead resembles a thick Submarine sandwich.

<text>RFA &quot;Wave Laird&quot; (A119) was an Wave-class fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She was built in 1946 as Empire Dunbar by Sir J Laing &amp; Sons Ltd, Sunderland, Co Durham for the Ministry of Transport and completed at &quot;Wave Laird&quot;. She served until 1961 when she was laid up at HMNB Devonport. &quot;Wave Laird&quot; was scrapped in 1970 in Spain.

==Description==
The ship was built in 1946 by Sir J Laing &amp; Sons Ltd, Sunderland. She was yard number 767.
The ship was long overall ( between perpendiculars), with a beam of . She had a draught of , and a depth of . She was assessed as , . Fully loaded, she displaced 16,650 tons.

The ship was propelled by two Metrovick-type double reduction geared steam turbines, which were fed by three drum boilers. . The turbines were built by Richardsons Westgarth Ltd. They drove a single screw propeller, and could propel the ship at .

==History==
Empire Dunbar was built by Sir J Laing &amp; Sons Ltd, Sunderland for the Ministry of Transport. She was launched on 3 April 1946 and completed on 30 September 1946 as RFA &quot;Wave Laird&quot; for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Her port of registry was London. She was allocated the United Kingdom Official Number 180967 and the Pennant number X129. This was later changed to A119.

&quot;Wave Laird&quot; suffered a number of problems shortly after entering service. In October 1946, her steering gear failed on a voyage from Sunderland to the Tyne and she was towed into port. In December 1946, boiler problems delayed her departure from Portland, Dorset for Trinidad. On 17 March 1947, boiler problems left her adrift in gale-force winds off the Tasker Rock, Ireland. Assistance was requested as the ship suffered heavy damage, which had to be repaired before her cargo was able to be discharged at Old Kilpatrick. 
On 10 November 1949, &quot;Wave Laird&quot; was on a voyage from Abadan, Iran to Malta when she was caught in a storm. A deckhand sustained fatal injuries. He was buried at Kalkara Naval Cemetery in Malta. The funeral was attended by officers and crew from , and &quot;Wave Laird&quot; and the Secretary of the Malta Branch of the National Union of Seamen.

&quot;Wave Laird&quot; was on active service in Korea from 25 June 1950 to 27 July 1953. She was awarded a battle honour. On 19 July 1951, she was involved in a collision with the Royal Interocean Line&#x27;s ocean liner off Singapore. In January 1954, &quot;Wave Laird&quot; was one of the naval vessels supporting the Royal Yacht in Australia. On 31 October 1956, &quot;Wave Laird&quot; was one of 35 Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships deployed as part of Operation Musketeer. From 16–29 September 1960, she was deployed off Iceland in support of the Royal Navy, which was caught up in the Cod Wars. &quot;Wave Laird&quot; was featured on a postcard produced by Valentine&#x27;s, Dundee. The card showed &quot;Wave Laird&quot; refuelling at sea.

&quot;Wave Laird&quot; was laid up in reserve at HMNB Devonport in 1961. She was advertised for sale by tender in November 1969 &quot;as lying at HMNB Devonport&quot;. She departed from Devonport under tow on 26 January 1970, bound for Gibraltar, from where she departed on 25 February under tow for Gandia, Spain. &quot;Wave Laird&quot; was scrapped in March 1970 by Hierros Ardes, Gandia.

<text>WIN Television is an Australian television network owned and operated by WIN Corporation that is based in Wollongong, New South Wales. WIN commenced transmissions on 18 March 1962 as a single television station covering the Wollongong region. The WIN Network has since grown to cover much of regional Australia. The network&#x27;s name, &quot;WIN&quot;, originates from its first station, Wollongong&#x27;s WIN-4.

WIN has a programme supply agreement with metropolitan broadcaster Nine Network, covering its stations in Regional Queensland, Southern and Western New South Wales, Griffith, Regional Victoria, Mildura, Tasmania, Eastern South Australia, and Regional Western Australia. WIN also has a programme supply agreement with third-placed metropolitan broadcaster Network 10 for its Northern New South Wales station. WIN also produces and broadcasts weeknight half-hour local news bulletins across its Queensland, southern New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania markets as WIN News.

==Regional services==
Through its many television broadcast licences, WIN re-broadcasts metropolitan network content into regional Australian markets, as follows:

==History==

===Early years in Wollongong===

Television Wollongong Transmission Limited (TWT) was incorporated on 4 October 1955 by a group of local businessmen. Five years later, it was awarded a licence by the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department over a number of other groups aligned to Sydney-based stations ATN-7 and TCN-9 to broadcast to the Illawarra and South Coast regions. The new station was to broadcast on the VHF-4 frequency, using the callsign WIN (which stood for &quot;Wollongong Illawarra New South Wales&quot;), in line with other Australian call signs.

===1980–1999: aggregation and expansion===
During this period, WIN expanded through the purchase of stations in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. In 1984, WIN became the first regional television station to transmit stereophonic sound. Close links between WIN Television and the Nine Network ensured the Nine Network affiliation for southern New South Wales when aggregation occurred in March 1989. The changes meant that WIN expanded into the rest of southern New South Wales, launching new stations in Canberra, Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo, and Wagga Wagga, with new buildings and studios built in Orange, Wagga, and Canberra. Aggregation also provided the network with two additional competitors, The Prime Network and Capital Television.

In 1990, WIN purchased Queensland station Star TV, with stations in Rockhampton (RTQ) and the Darling Downs (DDQ and SDQ), just weeks before aggregation was to occur in regional Queensland. The station had already been set to become a Network 10 affiliate under its previous owners; however, WIN&#x27;s links with the Nine Network enabled it to clinch the Nine Network affiliation away from QTV, which was then forced to affiliate with third-placed Network Ten with just days to go.

ENT Limited, a Launceston-based company that owned a number of television and radio stations in regional Victoria and Tasmania, was taken over by WIN in 1994. Television Victoria and TasTV were, as a result, rebranded as WIN Television. The network further expanded to Griffith in 1998, when WIN purchased MTN-9 Griffith and its supplementary station AMN-31 from its local owners. As MTN had been affiliated with WIN since the early 1990s, the station was easily integrated into the network.

WIN became regional Western Australia&#x27;s second commercial television network on 26 March 1999 after winning the rights tender in 1997. Prior to the launch of the new station, GWN held a commercial monopoly on the market. GWN became an affiliate of the Seven Network, while WIN took a combination of Nine Network and Network Ten programming. Despite Nine&#x27;s traditional ratings dominance throughout most of the country, incumbent GWN has remained the market&#x27;s most-watched station. The second ratings survey of 2006 placed WIN Television with a 34.7% commercial audience share in prime-time, compared to the Golden West Network with 65.3%.

Also in 1999, WIN purchased two stations in South Australia: SES-8 in Mount Gambier and RTS-5a in the Riverland region. They became known as &quot;WIN SA&quot;. In 2002, supplementary licences were granted under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act, allowing the network to launch a &quot;WIN Ten&quot; service using the &quot;MGS&quot; call sign in Mount Gambier and &quot;LRS&quot; in the Riverland. This enabled the main SES/RTS station to be a sole Nine Network affiliate, which lasted until 2007, when a supply agreement was made with Seven.

As well as the flagship weeknightly WIN News bulletin, WIN has been prolific in broadcasting relevant programmes for its audience. In the past, it produced current affairs programming, including the community affairs programme &quot;Roving Eye&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Review&quot;, a weekly review of international, national, and local stories. It produced a mid-week rugby league wrap panel show in the mid-1990s, while in 1995, WIN Television Queensland produced its own rugby league coverage by televising games featuring the fledgeling North Queensland Cowboys in their maiden ARL Winfield Cup competition season.

===2000–2016: Nine affiliation ===
WIN Television began to introduce digital television soon after it became available to metropolitan areas in January 2001. Under Section 38A of the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act&quot;, the network was able to introduce, in partnership with other stations, additional digital-only Network Ten affiliates. These included Tasmania&#x27;s TDT, launched in late 2003 in partnership with Southern Cross Broadcasting, and Mildura&#x27;s MDV in January 2006, with Prime Television.

On 30 May 2007, WIN purchased NWS from Southern Cross Broadcasting for A$105 million. Similarly, STW Perth, owned by Sunraysia Television and affiliated with the Nine Network, was purchased on 8 June 2007 for A$163.1 million.

Despite the station&#x27;s ownership of Nine Perth, the regional WIN WA service continued to broadcast Ten News Perth, produced for and shown on rival Perth station Ten Perth, until 27 August 2007, when Ten West came into service.

A conflict between WIN and its long-time metropolitan partner, the Nine Network, arose in mid-2007, with PBL Media, Nine&#x27;s parent company, requesting 40 percent of the network&#x27;s advertising revenue in return for programme supply. WIN&#x27;s owner, WIN Corporation, rejected this offer, expecting to pay only 29% (a 3% decrease from the previous contract and in line with many of the network&#x27;s competitors, such as Prime Television and Southern Cross Ten). The network&#x27;s owner, Bruce Gordon, subsequently threatened to sever the network&#x27;s affiliation after negotiations stagnated, stating that his previous position at Paramount Pictures meant he could programme the network independently. On 16 August 2007, WIN Television dropped key Nine Network programmes from its daytime television schedule, including &quot;Mornings with Kerri-Anne&quot; and &quot;National Nine News: Morning Edition&quot;. WIN also secured a new programme supply agreement for its regional South Australian station with Nine&#x27;s rival Seven Network. Announced on 4 September 2007, the new programme schedule included a mixture of Seven and existing WIN programming, commencing on 1 October 2007. WIN also started producing some local Australian programmes to replace key Nine content, including &quot;Alive and Cooking&quot; and &quot;Susie&quot;, as well as the independently sourced &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;. WIN also produced Fishing Australia as part of its local content output on the WIN Network. Two years later, WIN officially reinstated its supply of Nine content to regional South Australia with a new supplementary channel, WIN SA, relaying NWS from Adelaide.

On 9 August 2009, WIN began transmission of the new digital channel GO! on channel 88 in Southern NSW, Regional Victoria, Tasmania, and Regional Queensland. It soon reached Mildura in 2010 and regional SA in 2011.

In June 2010, playout was moved from WIN&#x27;s Wollongong headquarters to its new Media Hub facility in the south-west Sydney suburb of Ingleburn, co-owned with ABC Television.

On 26 September 2010, WIN began transmission of the HD digital channel GEM on channel 80 in Southern NSW, Regional Victoria, Tasmania, and Regional Queensland.

On 1 May 2012, WIN began transmission of an SD digital infomercial channel, Gold, on channel 84. The second infomercial channel, Gold2, began on 13 July 2013 as a five-hour timeshift of Gold.

Following Nine&#x27;s launch of 9HD and 9Life on 26 November 2015 and WIN&#x27;s promise of following suit, WIN began broadcasting a &quot;coming soon&quot; test pattern on channels 85 and 86 on 10 February 2016. Both channels began broadcasting on 1 March 2016. As a result, their channel listing was reshuffled to match Nine&#x27;s metropolitan with 9Gem on channel 82, 9Go! on channel 83, 9Life on channel 84, Extra on channel 85, and Gold on channel 86.

The network continued to produce its own local news service, WIN News, for most of its markets throughout its Nine affiliation, although requests for increased revenue by Nine repeatedly threatened the news division&#x27;s viability. By 2016, only twelve bulletins were being produced and presented.

===2016–2021: 10 affiliation===
After Nine launched its new online catch-up video on demand and live streaming service 9Now on 27 January 2016, WIN filed a lawsuit against Nine, claiming that live streaming into regional areas breached their exclusive affiliation agreement. Justice Hammerschlag of the NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case on 28 April 2016, ruling that the definition of &quot;broadcasting&quot; in WIN&#x27;s affiliation agreement with the Nine Network did not cover internet streaming &quot;and that Nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it&quot;.

Shortly after WIN&#x27;s legal defeat, Nine announced a new $500 million, five-year programme supply agreement with Southern Cross Austereo, the Ten affiliate. This saw Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s stations in Southern NSW, the ACT, and regional areas in Victoria and Queensland switch to Nine affiliation at midnight on 1 July 2016. With that announcement, WIN was effectively stripped of its 27-year partnership with Nine. In response, WIN entered affiliation talks with Network Ten, in which Gordon held a significant stake, reaching a final agreement on 23 May 2016. From 1 July 2016, WIN carried Ten programming into its regional Queensland, Southern NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia markets. Supplementary station deals were left until late due to disagreement over the rate that loss-making stations should make to Nine Network. With just days left, deals were secured for South Australia, Griffith, and Tasmania. However, no deal was secured for the Western Australia joint venture West Digital Television before 1 July, but a deal was later finalised on 2 July 2016, with the relay of Nine content commencing that night. The channel changes reshuffled WIN&#x27;s LCN listing, with One on LCNs 81 and 86, Eleven on LCN 82, TVSN on LCN 84, and Gold on LCN 85. WIN and WIN HD remained on LCNs 8 and 80. WIN also relocated its SD simulcast from LCN 81 to LCN 88.

Negotiations in January 2017 for WIN to acquire Northern New South Wales station NRN in exchange for WIN&#x27;s Wollongong radio station i98FM with Southern Cross Austereo failed, although a deal was secured on 28 March 2017 for the sole sale of NRN to WIN for $55 million. The sale took effect on 31 May 2017; NRN was rebranded as WIN on 1 September 2017, with playout and transmission transferred to WIN, while the LCNs were reshuffled to align with WIN&#x27;s other stations, although they stayed as 5-numbered due to 8-numbering already held by Nine-owned NBN Television for Northern NSW.

On 28 May 2018, WIN announced a new programme supply agreement with the Australian News Channel to carry Sky News Australia content on a new free-to-air channel, Sky News on WIN, which launched on 2 September 2018. The channel consisted of mixed Sky News and Fox Sports News programming, along with WIN&#x27;s All Australian News, while Sky programmes gained access to WIN&#x27;s regional news stories.

WIN converted TVSN to MPEG-4 SD on 30 August 2018, two days before the launch of Sky News on WIN.

On 31 October 2018, at 6:30pm, during The Project, WIN updated its logo, launching at the same time as the launch of Network 10&#x27;s new logo. WIN also rebranded its versions of 10&#x27;s multi-channels, One and Eleven, into WIN Boss (later changed to WIN Bold in December) and WIN Peach.

On 29 March 2021, the WIN channel in the Illawarra region was converted to MPEG-4 HD as an experiment for other WIN areas. On 14 May 2021, it was reverted to the MPEG-2 format in SD after viewers complained that they could no longer get the WIN channel on LCN 8.

===2021–present: Return to Nine affiliation===
On 12 March 2021, Nine announced it had secured a new programme supply agreement with its original partner, WIN Network, across regional Australia beginning 1 July 2021, in effect dumping Southern Cross Austereo, which was forced to return to relaying third-placed Ten content. The seven-year deal sees WIN pay around 50 percent of broadcast advertising revenue to Nine Entertainment Co., plus advertising time for Nine&#x27;s properties on WIN&#x27;s television and radio assets. WIN also integrated advertising sales services for Nine&#x27;s O&amp;O regional stations, NBN, and NTD. Nine CEO Hugh Marks explained that &quot;while our relationship with Southern Cross has been strong over the last five years, the opportunities presented by the WIN Network to both extend the reach of Nine&#x27;s premium content into more regional markets under one agreement and to work cooperatively with them on a national and local news operation mean this is the right time for us to return to WIN&quot;. Also for the first time, WIN now broadcasts Nine content under Nine branding. WIN&#x27;s multi-channels have again been rearranged, with 9Gem on channel 81, 9Go! on channel 82, and 9Life on channel 83, while TVSN and Gold would continue to broadcast on channels 84 and 85, but despite the return, the &quot;nine dots&quot; were not reinstated on the network logo. WIN still broadcasts Network Ten content on its northern New South Wales station.

On 18 March 2022, WIN Television celebrated 60 years of broadcasting across Wollongong and the Illawarra.

On 16 June 2022, WIN Television converted 9Gem and 9Go! to MPEG-4 SD in Tasmania via WIN&#x27;s Tasmanian station TVT.

On 22 March 2023, WIN Television announced that they would be converting all of their remaining MPEG-2 channels to MPEG-4 later that same year. On 22 May 2023, 9Gem was converted into an MPEG-4 SD channel in most WIN areas, except Tasmania, Western Australia, and Northern NSW. On 19 June 2023, 9Go! was converted into an MPEG-4 SD channel in most WIN areas, except Tasmania, Western Australia, and Northern NSW. In most WIN areas, except Northern NSW and Western Australia, 9Gem was upgraded to an MPEG-4 HD channel on 27 July 2023. In Northern NSW, WIN upgraded 10 Bold and 10 Peach from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4 in November 2023, 10 Bold on 21 November 2023, and 10 Peach on 28 November 2023. On 6 December 2023, 9Go! was converted into an MPEG-4 HD channel in most WIN areas, except Western Australia, and Northern NSW.

On 13 February 2025, Network 10 announced they would be acquiring the NRN from WIN Television. This followed Network 10&#x27;s announcement that they would also be acquiring Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s 10-affiliated stations. The sale is currently pending.

==Programming==
WIN Television carries the programming of all three commercial television stations in Australia. It is a sole affiliate of the Nine Network in all broadcast areas except for Northern NSW, but it is also an affiliate of the Seven Network in Griffith, New South Wales, and eastern South Australia and is an affiliate of Network 10 in Griffith, Northern New South Wales, and eastern South Australia. WIN Television has always produced regional programming, including the flagship local news service &quot;WIN News&quot;, that supplements programmes sourced from affiliates.

Since its inception, the network has produced and broadcast notable programmes, including &quot;Sportsview&quot; and &quot;Sportsworld&quot;, a review of international, national, and local sporting events. From the first week of transmissions, the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Channel 4 Club&quot; was produced, with the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Stopwatch&quot; beginning in 1979. The English-language educational programme &quot;You Say the Word&quot; began in 1971, catering to non-English-speaking immigrants. The long-running entertainment programme &quot;Variety Italian Style&quot; premiered in 1974, with Malcom Elliott initially hosting the short-lived &quot;Tonight Show&quot; in 1981 before being replaced by John Tingle a year later. To commemorate WIN Television&#x27;s 21st year of broadcasting, a one-and-a-half-hour retrospective montage special was produced in 1983. WIN Television also co-produced the telemovie &quot;Last Chance&quot; in 1986 with a Canadian television production company. Spanning close to a decade, the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Goodsports&quot; was produced by WIN Television from 1991 to 2000.

WIN Television&#x27;s current Australian programming productions consist of television shows including &quot;Fishing Australia&quot; and &quot;Alive and Cooking&quot;. On 17 May 2007, WIN Television announced a new midday programme called &quot;Susie;&quot; however, this was subsequently moved to a morning timeslot. It lasted until 2009. WIN Television also broadcasts a range of exclusive overseas and domestically sourced programming, including &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and &quot;Alive and Cooking;&quot; however, since 2021, WIN has broadcast a direct feed from Nine, excluding WIN News.

The only local programming broadcast by the WIN Network consists of half-hour local WIN News bulletins for its Nine stations in Regional Queensland, Southern New South Wales, Griffith, Regional Victoria, and Tasmania, as well as short news updates for its Ten station in northern New South Wales.

===News and current affairs===


WIN News is the network&#x27;s local news service. Fourteen regional bulletins and news updates are presented from studios in Wollongong, with reporters and camera crews based in district newsrooms. In most markets, &quot;WIN News&quot; may compete with &quot;Seven News&quot; or &quot;Nightly News&quot;.

WIN has produced independent news reports and bulletins since 1962 for its original Wollongong station. As well as the flagship nightly bulletin, WIN Television has in the past produced current affairs programming, including the community affairs programme &quot;Roving Eye&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Review&quot;, a weekly review of international, national, and local stories.

WIN also broadcast &quot;WIN&#x27;s All Australian News&quot; at 7am weekdays and weeknights at late nights, which featured highlights from news bulletins from its regional stations. It was axed in June 2021, following Nine&#x27;s new affiliation agreement with WIN.

===Sport===
On most of the WIN Network&#x27;s stations, it relays sports coverage broadcast from Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports. On WIN&#x27;s Northern New South Wales 10 station and other 10 stations in Griffith, Mildura, Regional WA, and Eastern SA owned by WIN and affiliated with 10, it relays sports coverage provided by 10 Sport. The Seven stations in Griffith, Mount Gambier, and the Riverland carry Seven Sport sports coverage.

==Availability==
WIN Television&#x27;s transmissions are available from both free-to-air terrestrial transmitters in major regional centres and free-to-view satellite transmissions across regional and remote Western Australia on the Viewer Access Satellite Television service. WIN News bulletins are carried on the VAST service to allow viewers in remote areas of Central and Eastern Australia, as well as terrestrial reception blackspots, to obtain news local to their area.

Subscription cable is also provided by TransACT in the Australian Capital Territory and Neighbourhood Cable in Ballarat and Mildura.

WIN broadcasts to a geographically large portion of regional and remote Australia through owned-and-operated stations including RTQ Queensland, NRN Northern New South Wales, WIN Southern New South Wales &amp; ACT, VTV Victoria, TVT Tasmania, MTN Griffith, STV Mildura, SES Mount Gambier, RTS Riverland, and WOW Western Australia.

===WIN HD===
WIN&#x27;s high-definition channel, WIN HD, originally launched on 17 March 2008 as a sister to the Nine Network&#x27;s rebranded high-definition simulcast, 9HD. WIN HD broadcast in 1080i high definition and was available on WIN&#x27;s regional stations, RTQ Queensland, WIN Southern New South Wales and ACT, VTV Victoria, and TVT Tasmania. The channel broadcast breakaway programming from launch until 3 August 2009, when it was turned into a straight HD simulcast. WIN HD fully ceased broadcasting on 26 September 2010 with the launch of the HD multi-channel GEM (now 9Gem).

On 10 February 2016, WIN announced that it would launch its own HD simulcast in the coming months in response to Nine Network relaunching 9HD as its second high-definition channel. &quot;WIN HD&quot; re-launched on 1 March 2016. Four WIN regions were excluded from the 1 March launch date, although in four regions the launch was delayed: Griffith, Mildura, Eastern South Australia (2 March due to technical issues), and Regional Western Australia (10 March). On 1 July 2016, with WIN&#x27;s new programme supply agreement, the channel&#x27;s programme schedule changed in line with WIN. The channel ceased on 30 June 2021 with WIN&#x27;s new programme supply agreement with Nine. WIN now re-broadcasts 9HD across its Nine stations and 10 HD across Northern New South Wales.

<text>RFA &quot;Olna&quot; (A216) was one of two ships built for Shell. She was originally named &quot;Hyalina&quot; and taken up for Fleet Service soon after building.

She was taken into service as a fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA). The ship was built for service with the British Pacific Fleet against Japan, and was commissioned into the Royal Navy for that purpose. However, after the Second World War the ship was quickly transferred to the RFA, making the move in 1946. &quot;Olna&quot; was crucial to the development of replenishment at sea doctrines for the British fleet, and saw service up until 1966.

In 1955 when serving with the Mediterranean fleet, &quot;Olna&quot; was used in the making of the film Battle of the River Plate to depict the German supply ship .

<text>RFA &quot;Fort Duquesne&quot; (A229) was a Fort ship and later an air stores ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Originally built as SS &quot;Queensborough Park&quot; for the Canadian Merchant Navy, the vessel was transferred to the British Ministry of War Transport before completion.

The vessel served in Atlantic convoys for the remainder of the Second World War and was transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1947. She was subsequently used for sea trials of the Westland WS-51 Dragonfly helicopter and played the role of the German tanker &quot;Tacoma&quot; in the 1956 film The Battle of the River Plate.

==Construction==
&quot;Fort Duquesne&quot; was built by West Coast Shipbuilders in Vancouver as SS &quot;Queensborough Park&quot; for the Canadian Merchant Navy as part of the Canadian government&#x27;s Park ship program. The vessel was a &quot;Victory&quot; type cargo ship. Before she was completed, the vessel was transferred to the British Ministry of War Transport.

On 31 January 1951 and 4 February 1951 she did sea trials off Isle of Portland and Plymouth UK using Dragon Fly helicopters from RNAS Gosport and RNAS Culdrose. The trials were conducted with 705 Naval Air Squadron in the English Channel using two Dragonfly HR1 helicopters. The helicopters used were Dragonfly VX598 and Dragonfly VZ963.

In 1955 she starred in the film &quot; The Battle of the River Plate&quot;, playing the German freighter &quot;Tacoma&quot;, which took the crew off the cruiser &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; before she was scuttled off Montevideo.

===Fate===
&quot;Fort Duquesne&quot; was decommissioned in April 1967 and put in reserve at Chatham. She arrived at the Scheldt for demolition at Tamise on 29 June 1967.

During World War II, 28 were lost to enemy action, and four were lost due to accidents. Many of the surviving 166 ships passed to the United States Maritime Commission. The last recorded scrapping was in 1985, and two ships, the former and , were listed on Lloyd&#x27;s Register until 1992.

His first motorcycle was a Royal Enfield Bullet earned from a job doing a milk round with his father. He later moved to Bradford where he served as an apprentice cabinet maker. Shepherd was a member of the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team during his National Service.

In 1956, Shepherd was persuaded to compete in the Isle of Man TT. He rode his own motorcycle to the dock in Liverpool and took the ferry to the Isle where, he finished in an impressive third place in the Clubmans Junior TT at the 1956 Isle of Man TT. Shepherd won the 1958 Junior Manx Grand Prix riding an AJS. He scored a double victory at the 1962 North West 200 when he claimed first place results in the 350cc and 500cc classes.

Shepherd&#x27;s greatest success came when he joined the East German MZ factory racing team led by their lead Development Engineer Walter Kaaden, known for his groundbreaking work in two stroke engine technology. Although MZ provided him with a motorcycle, the impoverished factory struggled to provide much support and, he competed while functioning as his own mechanic. Despite competing on a limited budget, Shepherd managed to win the season-opening 250cc United States Grand Prix, held at the Daytona International Speedway then, placed second to Honda&#x27;s Jim Redman at the Isle of Man Lightweight TT to finish the 1964 250cc world championship season in third place behind the powerful Yamaha and Honda teams represented by Phil Read and Redman.

In 1964 when a resident of Grange-over-Sands, Lancashire, England, he was allowed to keep his MZ 125 cc single cylinder and MZ 250 cc twin cylinder machines as part of his earnings due to currency difficulties with East Germany. He offered these two MZ for sale through &quot;Motor Cycle&quot;, a UK weekly magazine.

Shepherd retired in 1965 after recovering from a head injury suffered in late 1964 when testing a works Honda in preparation for the 1964 Japanese Grand Prix. He told &quot;Motor Cycle&quot;&#x27;s &quot;David Dixon&quot; in June 1965 that – whilst he felt fully recovered – he no longer had the confidence to be a top-runner, and would not ride Hondas unless he could give the best possible performance.

He died peacefully at Summerhill Nursing Home, Kendal, Cumbria in July 2007, with a funeral service at Cartmel Priory followed by cremation at Lancaster.

<text>RFA &quot;Fort Langley&quot; (A230) was a stores ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

The ship was launched on 31 October 1944 as &quot;Montebello Park&quot; by Victoria MD in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. She was completed on 18 May 1945 as &quot;Fort Langley&quot; for the Ministry of War Transport as an Air stores issuing ship under the management of Alfred Holt and Company. Transferred to the RFA in May 1954, she was decommissioned in February 1970, and laid up at Devonport. &quot;Fort Langley&quot; arrived at Bilbao for scrapping on 21 July 1970.

Fort and Park ship were the Canadian equivalent of the American Liberty ships. All three shared a similar design by J.L. Thompson and Sons of Sunderland, England. Fort ships had a triple expansion steam engine and a single screw propeller.

<text>Bernhard Rosenkränzer (born February 18, 1977) is the founder and main developer of Ark Linux (later merged into OpenMandriva) and a contributor to various other free software projects such as KDE and OpenOffice.org. To many in the Linux community he is known as &quot;Bero&quot;, a concatenation of the first two letters of his given and surnames.

His primary interest and work focus is in getting open source and free software ready for the desktop.

Rosenkränzer entered RWTH Aachen University in 1998, where he studied computer science. Before he started classes, he optimized Red Hat Linux by creating his own Linux distribution known as &quot;BeroLinux&quot;. During his studies, he started working for Mandrake Linux (later known as Mandriva). Rosenkränzer later accepted an offer to work for Red Hat Linux as a KDE package developer. However, he quit the job due to differences with Red Hat about the future of KDE in Red Hat.

Rosenkränzer also invented an improved system for satellite television distribution to schools in Ethiopia.

Until 2019, Rosenkränzer worked at Linaro, an organization dedicated to improving Linux on ARM processors. He also used to work for ROSA Laboratories, a company delivering their own custom brand of Mandriva Linux for the Russian government. As part of this work, Ark Linux has been merged into OpenMandriva.
After leaving Linaro, he turned his side project, an Open Source company called LinDev (short for LINux DEVelopment), into his main business. LinDev is currently involved with building the Eclipse Foundation&#x27;s Oniro Embedded operating system and works with Ampere Computing on ARM based Linux servers.

In 2012, he has been involved with speeding up Linaro&#x27;s Android builds by modifying Bionic (software) and making better use of the toolchain.

In 2017, he was the first to build and demo working prototypes of AArch64 based desktop and laptop machines.

He is currently the president of the OpenMandriva Association.

<text>Anticholinergics (anticholinergic agents) are substances that block the action of the acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter at synapses in the central and peripheral nervous system.

These agents inhibit the parasympathetic nervous system by selectively blocking the binding of ACh to its receptor in nerve cells. The nerve fibers of the parasympathetic system are responsible for the involuntary movement of smooth muscles present in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, lungs, sweat glands, and many other parts of the body.

In broad terms, anticholinergics are divided into two categories in accordance with their specific targets in the central and peripheral nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction: antimuscarinic agents and antinicotinic agents (ganglionic blockers, neuromuscular blockers).

The term &quot;anticholinergic&quot; is typically used to refer to antimuscarinics that competitively inhibit the binding of ACh to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; such agents do not antagonize the binding at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, although the term is sometimes used to refer to agents that do so.

==Medical uses==
Anticholinergic drugs are used to treat a variety of conditions:
* Dizziness (including vertigo and motion sickness-related symptoms)
* Extrapyramidal symptoms, a potential side-effect of antipsychotic medications
* Gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., peptic ulcers, diarrhea, pylorospasm, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, nausea, and vomiting)
* Genitourinary disorders (e.g., cystitis, urethritis, and prostatitis)
* Insomnia, although usually only on a short-term basis
* Respiratory disorders (e.g., asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD])
* Sinus bradycardia due to a hypersensitive vagus nerve
* Organophosphate based nerve agent poisoning, such as VX, sarin, tabun, and soman (atropine is favoured in conjunction with an oxime, usually pralidoxime)

Anticholinergics generally have antisialagogue effects (decreasing saliva production), and most produce some level of sedation, both being advantageous in surgical procedures.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, anticholinergic drugs were widely used to treat psychiatric disorders.

==Physiological effects==
Effects of anticholinergic drugs include:

* Delirium (often with hallucinations and delusions indistinguishable from reality)
*Ocular symptoms (from eye drops): mydriasis, pupil dilation, and acute angle-closure glaucoma in those with shallow anterior chamber
*Anhidrosis, dry mouth, dry skin
* Fever
* Constipation
* Tachycardia
* Urinary retention
*Cutaneous vasodilation

Clinically the most significant feature is delirium, particularly in the elderly, who are most likely to be affected by the toxidrome.

==Side effects==
Long-term use may increase the risk of both cognitive and physical decline. It is unclear whether they affect the risk of death generally. However, in older adults they do appear to increase the risk of death.

Possible effects of anticholinergics include:
* Poor coordination
* Dementia
* Decreased mucus production in the nose and throat; consequent dry, sore throat
* Dry mouth with possible acceleration of dental caries
* Cessation of sweating; consequent decreased epidermal thermal dissipation leading to warm, blotchy, or red skin
* Increased body temperature
* Pupil dilation; consequent sensitivity to bright light (photophobia)
* Loss of accommodation (loss of focusing ability, blurred vision – cycloplegia)
* Double vision
* Increased heart rate
* Tendency to be easily startled
* Urinary retention
* Urinary incontinence while sleeping
* Diminished bowel movement, sometimes ileus (decreases motility via the vagus nerve)
* Increased intraocular pressure; dangerous for people with narrow-angle glaucoma
Possible effects in the central nervous system resemble those associated with delirium, and may include:
* Confusion
* Disorientation
* Agitation
* Euphoria or dysphoria
* Respiratory depression
* Memory problems
* Inability to concentrate
* Wandering thoughts; inability to sustain a train of thought
* Incoherent speech
* Irritability
* Mental confusion (brain fog)
* Wakeful myoclonic jerking
* Unusual sensitivity to sudden sounds
* Illogical thinking
* Photophobia
* Visual disturbances 
** Periodic flashes of light
** Periodic changes in visual field
**Visual snow
** Restricted or &quot;tunnel vision&quot;
* Visual, auditory, or other sensory hallucinations
** Warping or waving of surfaces and edges
** Textured surfaces
** &quot;Dancing&quot; lines; &quot;spiders&quot;, insects; form constants
** Lifelike objects indistinguishable from reality
** Phantom smoking 
** Hallucinated presence of people not actually there (e.g. shadow people)
* Rarely: seizures, coma, and death
* Orthostatic hypotension (severe drop in systolic blood pressure when standing up suddenly) and significantly increased risk of falls in the elderly population
Older patients are at a higher risk of experiencing CNS side effects. The link possible between anticholinergic medication use and cognitive decline/dementia has been noted in weaker observational studies. Although there is no strong evidence from randomized controlled trials to suggest that these medications should be avoided, clinical guidelines suggest that a consideration be made to decrease the use of these medications if safe to do so and the use of these medications be carefully considered to reduce any possible adverse effects including cognitive decline. 

===Toxicity===
An acute anticholinergic syndrome is reversible and subsides once all of the causative agents have been excreted. Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents such as physostigmine can be used as an antidote in life-threatening cases. Wider use is discouraged due to the significant side effects related to cholinergic excess including seizures, muscle weakness, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, lacrimation, salivation, bronchorrhea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Even in documented cases of anticholinergic toxicity, seizures have been reported after the rapid administration of physostigmine. Asystole has occurred after physostigmine administration for tricyclic antidepressant overdose, so a conduction delay (QRS &gt; 0.10 second) or suggestion of tricyclic antidepressant ingestion is generally considered a contraindication to physostigmine administration.

Dementia

A recent study carried out by experts from the University of Nottingham and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has shown there to be an increased risk of up to 50% of patients developing Dementia due to some of these medications and cautions have been advised with their use. The study findings showed increased risks of dementia for anticholinergic drugs overall and specifically for the anticholinergic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, antiparkinsons drugs, bladder drugs and epilepsy drugs after accounting for other risk factors for dementia.

==Pharmacology==
Anticholinergics are classified according to the receptors that are affected:
* &quot;Antimuscarinic&quot; agents operate on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The majority of anticholinergic drugs are antimuscarinics.
* &quot;Antinicotinic&quot; agents operate on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The majority of these are non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants for surgical use that are structurally related to curare. Several are depolarizing agents.

==Examples==
Examples of common anticholinergics:
* Antimuscarinic agents
** Antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine)
** Atropine
** Benztropine
** Biperiden
** Chlorpheniramine
** Certain SSRIs (Paroxetine)
** Dicyclomine (Dicycloverine)
** Dimenhydrinate 
** Diphenhydramine
** Doxepin
** Doxylamine 
** Flavoxate
** Glycopyrronium/-late 
** Hyoscyamine
** Ipratropium
** Orphenadrine 
** Oxitropium
** Oxybutynin
** Promethazine
** Propantheline bromide 
** Scopolamine
** Solifenacin
** Tolterodine
** Tiotropium 
** Tricyclic antidepressants
** Trihexyphenidyl
** Tropicamide
** Umeclidinium 
* Antinicotinic agents
** Bupropion – Ganglion blocker
** Dextromethorphan - Cough suppressant and ganglion blocker
** Doxacurium – Nondepolarizing skeletal muscular relaxant
** Hexamethonium – Ganglion blocker
** Mecamylamine – Ganglion blocker and occasional smoking cessation aid 
** Tubocurarine - Nondepolarizing skeletal muscular relaxant
===Antidotes===
Physostigmine is one of only a few drugs that can be used as an antidote for anticholinergic poisoning. Nicotine also counteracts anticholinergics by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Caffeine (although an adenosine receptor antagonist) can counteract the anticholinergic symptoms by reducing sedation and increasing acetylcholine activity, thereby causing alertness and arousal.

==Psychoactive uses==
When a significant amount of an anticholinergic is taken into the body, a toxic reaction known as acute anticholinergic syndrome may result. This may happen accidentally or intentionally as a consequence of either recreational or entheogenic drug use, though many users find the side effects to be exceedingly unpleasant and not worth the recreational effects they experience. In the context of recreational use, anticholinergics are often called deliriants.

==Plant sources==
The most common plants containing anticholinergic alkaloids (including atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine among others) are:
*&quot;Atropa belladonna&quot; (deadly nightshade)
*&quot;Brugmansia&quot; species 
*&quot;Datura&quot; species
*&quot;Garrya&quot; species
*&quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot; (henbane)
*&quot;Mandragora officinarum&quot; (mandrake)

==Use as a deterrent==
Several narcotic and opiate-containing drug preparations, such as those containing hydrocodone and codeine are combined with an anticholinergic agent to deter intentional misuse. Examples include hydrocodone/homatropine (Tussigon, Hydromet, Hycodan), diphenoxylate/atropine (Lomotil), and hydrocodone polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex (Tussionex Pennkinetic, TussiCaps). However, it is noted that opioid/antihistamine combinations are used clinically for their synergistic effect in the management of pain and maintenance of dissociative anesthesia (sedation) in such preparations as meperidine/promethazine (Mepergan) and dipipanone/cyclizine (Diconal), which act as strong anticholinergic agents.

<text>RFA &quot;Salvestor&quot; (A499) was a &quot;King Salvor&quot;-class salvage vessel of the post war Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

&quot;Salvestor&quot; was built by Wm. Simons &amp; Co. Ltd. of Renfrew, Scotland. Laid down on 20 September 1941 as &quot;Assistance&quot;, and launched on 28 August 1942 as HMS &quot;Salvestor&quot;. 
The ship was decommissioned in September 1959, laid up at Pembroke Dock, and sold for breaking up to Thos. W. Ward at Briton Ferry in July 1970.

==Service history==
During the Second World War the &quot;Salvestor&quot; was one of two Royal Navy ships manned by South African Naval personnel (SANF). She remained the property of the Royal Navy, but was under SANF control from 31 August 1944. She served in the Mediterranean and then participated in the war against Japan with the British Eastern Fleet.

In 1945 &quot;Salvestor&quot; assisted a merchant ship that had encountered problems more than 200 km from Milne Bay, New Guinea. After the war &quot;Salvestor&quot; salvaged a number of wrecks from Hong Kong Harbour, including a Japanese tug. The SANF crew was gradually replaced by Royal Navy personnel, she was handed back to the Royal Navy in 1946.

For services rendered in the war against Japan, the &quot;Salvestor&quot; received the &quot;Pacific 1942-45&quot; battle honour, the only South African-manned naval vessel to be honoured in this way.

<doc id="527227" wikidata="Q7899547" url="?curid=527227" title="Urad, Poland">
<text>Urad () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Cybinka, within Słubice County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland, close to the border of Germany.

It lies on the Oder river, approximately north-west of Cybinka, south-east of Słubice, south-west of Gorzów Wielkopolski, and north-west of Zielona Góra. It is located within the historic Lubusz Land.

==History==
There are several archaeological sites from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, antiquity and Early Middle Ages in the village. The area formed part of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century. The territory was administratively located within the Lubusz castellany and the Catholic Diocese of Lubusz, both established in the early 12th century by Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth. The current settlement was formed in the early 13th century. It was first mentioned in documents in 1350. After Polish rule, it was ruled by the Margraviate of Brandenburg and Bohemia (Czechia). Its original Slavic (Polish) name Urad remained official until 1608, when it was Germanized to &quot;Aurith&quot;. Despite the annexation of the territory by Brandenburg, the village was still inhabited by Poles in the 17th century, and there were church services in the Polish language. From the 18th century, it was part of Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, in 1945, along with the right-bank Lubusz Land (portion situated east of the Oder River) the majority of the village became part of Poland, and its original name was restored. On June 22, 1945, at two hours notice, all inhabitants were forced to leave their homes, allowed a maximal luggage of 10 kg. New Polish people later arrived in the village. 
A few remaining houses left of the Oder became part of East Germany and were incorporated into the municipality of Ziltendorf.

<text>RFA &quot;Green Ranger&quot; was a Ranger-class fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

On 24 September 1946, &quot;Green Ranger&quot; was struck by a torpedo in Portland Harbour, Dorset. Although holed belowe the waterline, she remained afloat. She was wrecked on the Hartland peninsula, on a large rock, called Gunpath Rock, on 17 November 1962. She broke her tow from the tug that was taking her to be refitted in Cardiff, and drifted onto the rocks. Her skeleton crew of seven were rescued by the Hartland Lifesaving Company, with their breeches buoy. The ship became a total loss, and her remains are still visible at low tide.

<text>Fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at hydrostatic equilibrium and &quot;the pressure in a fluid or exerted by a fluid on an immersed body&quot;.

It encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics is a subcategory of fluid statics, which is the study of all fluids, both compressible or incompressible, at rest.

Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics, the engineering of equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids. It is also relevant to geophysics and astrophysics (for example, in understanding plate tectonics and the anomalies of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field), to meteorology, to medicine (in the context of blood pressure), and many other fields.

Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of still water is always level according to the curvature of the earth.

==History==

Some principles of hydrostatics have been known in an empirical and intuitive sense since antiquity, by the builders of boats, cisterns, aqueducts and fountains. Archimedes is credited with the discovery of Archimedes&#x27; Principle, which relates the buoyancy force on an object that is submerged in a fluid to the weight of fluid displaced by the object. The Roman engineer Vitruvius warned readers about lead pipes bursting under hydrostatic pressure.

The concept of pressure and the way it is transmitted by fluids was formulated by the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal in 1647.

===Hydrostatics in ancient Greece and Rome===

====Pythagorean Cup====
The &quot;fair cup&quot; or Pythagorean cup, which dates from about the 6th century BC, is a hydraulic technology whose invention is credited to the Greek mathematician and geometer Pythagoras. It was used as a learning tool.

The cup consists of a line carved into the interior of the cup, and a small vertical pipe in the center of the cup that leads to the bottom. The height of this pipe is the same as the line carved into the interior of the cup. The cup may be filled to the line without any fluid passing into the pipe in the center of the cup. However, when the amount of fluid exceeds this fill line, fluid will overflow into the pipe in the center of the cup. Due to the drag that molecules exert on one another, the cup will be emptied.

====Heron&#x27;s fountain====

Heron&#x27;s fountain is a device invented by Heron of Alexandria that consists of a jet of fluid being fed by a reservoir of fluid. The fountain is constructed in such a way that the height of the jet exceeds the height of the fluid in the reservoir, apparently in violation of principles of hydrostatic pressure. The device consisted of an opening and two containers arranged one above the other. The intermediate pot, which was sealed, was filled with fluid, and several cannula (a small tube for transferring fluid between vessels) connecting the various vessels. Trapped air inside the vessels induces a jet of water out of a nozzle, emptying all water from the intermediate reservoir.

===Pascal&#x27;s contribution in hydrostatics===

Pascal made contributions to developments in both hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. Pascal&#x27;s Law is a fundamental principle of fluid mechanics that states that any pressure applied to the surface of a fluid is transmitted uniformly throughout the fluid in all directions, in such a way that initial variations in pressure are not changed.

==Pressure in fluids at rest==
Due to the fundamental nature of fluids, a fluid cannot remain at rest under the presence of a shear stress. However, fluids can exert pressure normal to any contacting surface. If a point in the fluid is thought of as an infinitesimally small cube, then it follows from the principles of equilibrium that the pressure on every side of this unit of fluid must be equal. If this were not the case, the fluid would move in the direction of the resulting force. Thus, the pressure on a fluid at rest is isotropic; i.e., it acts with equal magnitude in all directions. This characteristic allows fluids to transmit force through the length of pipes or tubes; i.e., a force applied to a fluid in a pipe is transmitted, via the fluid, to the other end of the pipe. This principle was first formulated, in a slightly extended form, by Blaise Pascal, and is now called Pascal&#x27;s law.

===Hydrostatic pressure===
In a fluid at rest, all frictional and inertial stresses vanish and the state of stress of the system is called &quot;hydrostatic&quot;. When this condition of is applied to the Navier–Stokes equations for viscous fluids or Euler equations (fluid dynamics) for ideal inviscid fluid, the gradient of pressure becomes a function of body forces only. 
The Navier-Stokes momentum equations are:
{\mathrm{D} t} = - \nabla [p - \zeta (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})] + \nabla \cdot \left\{ \mu \left[\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf I\right] \right\} + \rho\mathbf{g} .&lt;/math&gt;

By setting the flow velocity formula_1, they become simply:

formula_2

or:

formula_3

This is the general form of Stevin&#x27;s law: the pressure gradient equals the body force force density field.

Let us now consider two particular cases of this law. In case of a conservative body force with scalar potential formula_4:

formula_5

the Stevin equation becomes:
formula_6

That can be integrated to give:

formula_7

So in this case the pressure difference is the opposite of the difference of the scalar potential associated to the body force.
In the other particular case of a body force of constant direction along z:

formula_8

the generalised Stevin&#x27;s law above becomes:

formula_9

That can be integrated to give another (less-) generalised Stevin&#x27;s law:

formula_10

where:
* formula_11 is the hydrostatic pressure (Pa),
* formula_12 is the fluid density (kg/m3),
* formula_13 is gravitational acceleration (m/s2),
* formula_14 is the height (parallel to the direction of gravity) of the test area (m),
* formula_15 is the height of the zero reference point of the pressure (m)
* formula_16 is the hydrostatic pressure field (Pa) along x and y at the zero reference point 

For water and other liquids, this integral can be simplified significantly for many practical applications, based on the following two assumptions. Since many liquids can be considered incompressible, a reasonable good estimation can be made from assuming a constant density throughout the liquid. The same assumption cannot be made within a gaseous environment. Also, since the height formula_17 of the fluid column between and is often reasonably small compared to the radius of the Earth, one can neglect the variation of . Under these circumstances, one can transport out of the integral the density and the gravity acceleration and the law is simplified into the formula
:formula_18

where formula_17 is the height of the liquid column between the test volume and the zero reference point of the pressure. This formula is often called Stevin&#x27;s law. 
One could arrive to the above formula also by considering the first particular case of the equation for a conservative body force field: in fact the body force field of uniform intensity and direction:

formula_20

is conservative, so one can write the body force density as:

formula_21

Then the body force density has a simple scalar potential:

formula_22

And the pressure difference follows another time the Stevin&#x27;s law:

formula_23

The reference point should lie at or below the surface of the liquid. Otherwise, one has to split the integral into two (or more) terms with the constant and . For example, the absolute pressure compared to vacuum is

:formula_24

where formula_17 is the total height of the liquid column above the test area to the surface, and is the atmospheric pressure, i.e., the pressure calculated from the remaining integral over the air column from the liquid surface to infinity. This can easily be visualized using a pressure prism.

Hydrostatic pressure has been used in the preservation of foods in a process called pascalization.

===Medicine===
In medicine, hydrostatic pressure in blood vessels is the pressure of the blood against the wall. It is the opposing force to oncotic pressure. In capillaries, hydrostatic pressure (also known as capillary blood pressure) is higher than the opposing “colloid osmotic pressure” in blood—a “constant” pressure primarily produced by circulating albumin—at the arteriolar end of the capillary. This pressure forces plasma and nutrients out of the capillaries and into surrounding tissues. Fluid and the cellular wastes in the tissues enter the capillaries at the venule end, where the hydrostatic pressure is less than the osmotic pressure in the vessel.

===Atmospheric pressure===
Statistical mechanics shows that, for a pure ideal gas of constant temperature in a gravitational field, &quot;T&quot;, its pressure, &quot;p&quot; will vary with height, &quot;h&quot;, as

:formula_26

where
* is the acceleration due to gravity
* is the absolute temperature
* is Boltzmann constant
* is the molecular mass of the gas
* is the pressure
* is the height

This is known as the barometric formula, and may be derived from assuming the pressure is hydrostatic.

If there are multiple types of molecules in the gas, the partial pressure of each type will be given by this equation. Under most conditions, the distribution of each species of gas is independent of the other species.

===Buoyancy===

Any body of arbitrary shape which is immersed, partly or fully, in a fluid will experience the action of a net force in the opposite direction of the local pressure gradient. If this pressure gradient arises from gravity, the net force is in the vertical direction opposite that of the gravitational force. This vertical force is termed buoyancy or buoyant force and is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, to the weight of the displaced fluid. Mathematically,

:formula_27

where is the density of the fluid, is the acceleration due to gravity, and is the volume of fluid directly above the curved surface. In the case of a ship, for instance, its weight is balanced by pressure forces from the surrounding water, allowing it to float. If more cargo is loaded onto the ship, it would sink more into the water – displacing more water and thus receive a higher buoyant force to balance the increased weight.

Discovery of the principle of buoyancy is attributed to Archimedes.
===Hydrostatic force on submerged surfaces===
The horizontal and vertical components of the hydrostatic force acting on a submerged surface are given by the following formula:

:formula_28

where
* is the pressure at the centroid of the vertical projection of the submerged surface
* is the area of the same vertical projection of the surface
* is the density of the fluid
* is the acceleration due to gravity
* is the volume of fluid directly above the curved surface

==Liquids (fluids with free surfaces)==
Liquids can have free surfaces at which they interface with gases, or with a vacuum. In general, the lack of the ability to sustain a shear stress entails that free surfaces rapidly adjust towards an equilibrium. However, on small length scales, there is an important balancing force from surface tension.

===Capillary action===
When liquids are constrained in vessels whose dimensions are small, compared to the relevant length scales, surface tension effects become important leading to the formation of a meniscus through capillary action. This capillary action has profound consequences for biological systems as it is part of one of the two driving mechanisms of the flow of water in plant xylem, the transpirational pull.

===Hanging drops===
Without surface tension, drops would not be able to form. The dimensions and stability of drops are determined by surface tension. The drop&#x27;s surface tension is directly proportional to the cohesion property of the fluid.

<text>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? () is an 1897–98 painting by French artist Paul Gauguin. The painting was created in Tahiti and is in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. Viewed as a masterpiece by Gauguin, the painting is considered &quot;a philosophical work comparable to the themes of the Gospels&quot;.

The painting is notable for its enigmatic subject and atmosphere. Some scholars have attributed these qualities to personal conflicts that Gauguin experienced while creating this artwork. It is an accentuation of Gauguin&#x27;s trailblazing Post-Impressionistic style.

Frizeau sold the painting around 1913 to Galerie Barbazanges, which sold it before 1920 to the Norwegian ship owner and art collector Jørgen Breder Stang [no]. He sold the painting via Alfred Gold in 1935, and it was bought by the Marie Harriman Gallery in New York City in 1936. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, acquired it from the Marie Harriman Gallery on 16 April 1936.

==Background==
Gauguin had been a student at the Petit Séminaire de La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin, just outside Orléans, from the age of eleven to the age of sixteen. His studies there included a class in Catholic liturgy; the teacher for this class was the Bishop of Orléans, Félix-Antoine-Philibert Dupanloup. Dupanloup had devised his own catechism for students to lead them toward proper spiritual reflections on the nature of life. The three fundamental questions in this catechism were &quot;where does humanity come from?&quot; &quot;where is it going to?&quot;, and &quot;how does humanity proceed?&quot; Although in later life Gauguin was vociferously anticlerical, these questions from Dupanloup&#x27;s catechism had lodged in his mind, and &quot;where?&quot; became the key question that Gauguin asked in his art.

Looking for a society more simple and elemental than that of his native France, Gauguin left for Tahiti in 1891. In addition to several other paintings that express his highly individualistic mythology, he completed this painting in 1897. During the process of creating this painting, Gauguin experienced several difficult events in his personal life. He suffered from medical conditions including eczema, syphilis, and conjunctivitis. He faced financial challenges, and going into debt. He was also informed about the death of his daughter from Copenhagen. From one of many letters to his friend, Daniel de Monfreid, Gauguin disclosed his plan to commit suicide in December 1897. Before he did, however, he wanted to paint a large canvas that would be known as the grand culmination of his thoughts.

Following the completion of &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot; Gauguin made a suicide attempt with arsenic.

== Details and analysis ==
The three major groups in the painting reflect the overall themes presented in the title.

The three crouched women with a sleeping child on the right represent the beginning of life; the middle group symbolizes the daily existence of young adulthood; in the final group, according to the artist, &quot;an old woman approaching death appears reconciled and resigned to her thoughts&quot;; at her feet, &quot;a strange white bird...represents the futility of words&quot; or &quot;the uselessness of vain words&quot;. Together, the painting from right to left suggests the cycle of &quot;birth-sin-death&quot;. Outside of this cycle of life, there is a blue figure. The blue idol in the background represents what Gauguin described as &quot;the Beyond.&quot;

Gauguin approaches the life cycle from a feminine perspective. The girl surrounded by kittens demonstrates the purity of &quot;girlhood&quot;. The figure in the center is placed in a &quot;Garden of Eden motif&quot;; she is picking fruits from a tree. Gauguin intended to represent this woman as a sin, like the allegory of Eve. Maternity is represented through the figures that surround the baby. Along with the motherhood of a woman&#x27;s life, Gauguin also displays the idea of &quot;domestic submission&quot; through the bracelet and collar worn by the mature woman on the left and the white goat, respectively. Finally, the state of seniority can be seen through the old woman on the left.

Near the blissful people are two sorrowful women by a tree who stand in contrast with their surroundings. In front of these women is a crouched figure who lifts her arm. The three women have been interpreted by one scholar as representing the contrast between enlightenment and “superstitious, irrational, even barbaric traditions”.

The painting also includes several inscriptions. Gauguin inscribed the original French title in the upper left corner: D&#x27;où Venons Nous / Que Sommes Nous / Où Allons Nous. The inscription the artist wrote on his canvas has no question mark, no dash, and all words are capitalized. In the upper right corner, he signed and dated the painting: &quot;P. Gauguin / 1897&quot;.

== Style ==
The painting is an accentuation of Gauguin&#x27;s trailblazing Post-Impressionistic style; his art stressed the vivid use of colors and thick brushstrokes, while it aimed to convey an emotional or expressionistic strength. It emerged in conjunction with other avant-garde movements of the twentieth century, including Cubism and Fauvism.

== Reception and provenance ==
In 1898, Gauguin sent the painting to Georges-Daniel de Monfreid in Paris. Monfreid passed it to Ambroise Vollard along with eight other thematically related pictures shipped earlier. They went on view at the Galerie Vollard from November 17 to December 10 1898. The exhibition was a success, although &quot;D&#x27;où Venons Nous?&quot; received mixed reviews.

 unsuccessfully tried to raise funds to purchase the painting on behalf of France. purchased the painting from Vollard for 2,500 francs in 1901.

Subsequently, Frizeau sold the painting around 1913 to Galerie Barbazanges, which sold it before 1920 to the Norwegian ship owner and art collector . He sold the painting via Alfred Gold in 1935, and it was bought by the Marie Harriman Gallery in New York City in 1936. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, acquired it from the Marie Harriman Gallery on 16 April 1936.

== Critics and Gauguin ==
Critics thought of Paul Gauguin as one of the major artists of the time, but they were unsure about the artist&#x27;s intentions in this work. Thadée Natanson of &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot; expressed confusion over its meaning, describing it as &quot;obscure&quot;.

The critic André Fontainas of the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; acknowledged grudging respect for the work but thought the allegory would be impenetrable without the inscription, and compared the painting to &quot;Inter artes et naturam (Between Art and Nature)&quot; of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.

Although Gauguin appreciated the works of Puvis, he wanted to differentiate his works from “the great master of decorative painting”. He explained to Fontainas that the objectives of Puvis&#x27;s works were predetermined and could be conveyed in words; he believed his works consist of a great &quot;pictorial language of feelings&quot;. Gauguin believed that his paintings had abstract, inexplicable qualities that could not be expressed in literary terms.

<text>RFA &quot;Cedardale&quot; (A380) was a Dale-class fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She was originally one of two ships which were purchased by the British Admiralty from the Anglo Saxon Petroleum Co for evaluation purposes. &quot;Cedardale&quot; was decommissioned on 15 November 1959 and laid up at Hong Kong.

==Career==
&quot;Cedardale&quot; was built by Blythswood Shipbuilding Company, Scotstoun and launched on 25 March 1939. Her engines and machinery were fitted at James Watt Dock, Greenock, with her sea trials taking place in the Firth of Clyde on 24 May 1939. After the successful completion of these, &quot;Cedardale&quot; was accepted into Admiralty service on 25 May, departing two days later, on 27 May on her maiden voyage to Abadan, on the Persian Gulf. The first months of World War II were spent in the Red Sea and Eastern Mediterranean.

After returning to the UK in early 1940, &quot;Cedardale&quot; was despatched to Trinidad, and then to Freetown, where in July 1940 she was attached to Force R. She was based at Freetown until August 1942, during which time she refuelled several Royal Navy ships. &quot;Cedardale&quot; was at New Orleans in September and October 1942, undergoing repairs, refit and docking. She then sailed to the Seychelles, via Curaçao, Simonstown and Mauritius, remaining based in the Indian Ocean, operating between Mombasa, Addu Atoll, Trincomalee and Bombay until April 1943. She then returned to the Mediterranean for service with the allied forces gathering for Operation Husky, the allied invasion of Sicily. Attached as part of Force R, she provided refuelling support to the destroyers involved in the operation. The rest of 1943 was spent in the Mediterranean, with port calls at Port Said, Haifa, Alexandria, Malta and Tripoli.

&quot;Cedardale&quot; returned to the Indian Ocean in early 1944, with service at Diego Suarez, Colombo and Trincomalee. In March 1945 she was moved to the Pacific Ocean to support allied operations there, assigned to the British Pacific Fleet. Deployed off Leyte Gulf, she was part of Task Force 112 in Operation Iceberg, the British Fleet Train&#x27;s contribution to the allied assault on Okinawa. The next few months were spent in these waters, often based out of Manus, Admiralty Islands, refuelling British and Australian vessels. After the surrender of Japan she sailed to Singapore, via Shanghai and Subic Bay, remaining there until December 1945, when she returned to the UK.

The postwar years were spent deployed to the Far East, making frequent voyages to and from the UK via the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. On 13 September 1958 she was one of several British ships, including RFA &quot;Sea Salvor&quot;, which took part in rescue and salvage operations after a two ship collision in the Gulf of Oman resulted in a large fire, with 24 deaths. &quot;Cedardale&quot; salvaged 11,000 tons of oil. She was laid up at Hong Kong on 15 November 1959, and advertised for sale on 3 December 1959. On 2 February 1960 she was sold for scrapping to Matthews Wighton at Hong Kong.

<doc id="527240" wikidata="Q51159758" url="?curid=527240" title="Parricide">
<text>Parricide is the deliberate killing of one&#x27;s own father and mother, spouse (husband or wife), children, and/or close relatives. However, the term is sometimes used more generally to refer to the intentional killing of a near relative. It is an umbrella term that can be used to refer to acts of matricide, the deliberate killing of one&#x27;s own mother and patricide, the deliberate killing of one&#x27;s own father. 

The term parricide is also used to refer to many familicides (i.e., family annihilations wherein at least one parent is murdered along with other family members).

Societies consider parricide a serious crime and parricide offenders are subject to criminal prosecution under the homicide laws which are established in places (i.e., countries, states, etc.) in which parricides occur. In most countries, an adult who is convicted of parricide faces a long-term prison sentence, a life sentence, or even capital punishment. Youthful parricide offenders who are younger than the age of majority (e.g., 18-year-olds in the United States &amp; United Kingdom of Great Britain) may be prosecuted under less stringent laws which are designed to take their special needs and development into account, but these laws are usually waived and as a result, most youthful parricide offenders are transferred into the Adult Judicial System.

Parricide offenders are typically divided into two categories;
# youthful parricide offenders (i.e. ages 8–24) and
# adult parricide offenders (i.e. ages 25 and older) because the motivations and situations surrounding parricide events change as a child matures.

== Prevalence ==
As per the Parricide Prevention Institute, approximately 2–3% of all U.S. murders were parricides each year since 2010. The more than 300 parricides occurring in just the U.S. each year means there are 6 or more parricide events, on average, each week. This estimate does not include the murders of grandparents or stepparents by a child – only the murders of their natal or legally adoptive parents.

== Youthful motives ==
Youthful parricide is motivated by a variety of factors. Current research conducted by the Parricide Prevention Institute indicates the top five motives causing a child (aged 8–24 years old) to commit parricide are:
* issues of control – 38% (e.g. put on restriction, phone taken away, etc.);
* issues of money – 10% (access to life insurance, wants money for a party, etc.);
* stop abuse of self or family – 8%;
* fit of anger – 8%;
* wants a different life – 7% (e.g. wants to live with non-custodial parent, etc.).

== Notable modern-day cases ==
* The Criminal Code of Japan once determined that patricide brought capital punishment or life imprisonment. However, the law was abolished because of the trial of the Tochigi patricide case in which a woman killed her father in 1968 after she was sexually abused by him and bore their children.
* Charles Whitman killed his mother and his wife before climbing the bell tower at UT-Austin and randomly killing people in 1966. Upon autopsy he was found to have a tumor on his amygdala.
* Lyle and Erik Menendez both killed their parents in 1989 due to fear that their parents were plotting to kill them.
* Dana Ewell hired two of his friends to murder his father, mother and sister in 1992. All three were convicted of murder.
* Kip Kinkel killed his parents before committing the Thurston High School shooting in 1998.
* Suzane von Richthofen killed her father and her mother with the help of her boyfriend and his brother in São Paulo in 2002.
* Nicole Kasinskas killed her mother with the help of her boyfriend in 2003.
* Sarah Marie Johnson was the only female to kill both of her parents without the help of an accomplice in 2003.
* Thomas Bartlett Whitaker killed his mother and his brother (and tried to kill his father but failed) in 2003.
* Tyler Hadley killed both of his parents on July 16, 2011.
* Adam Lanza killed his mother before committing the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012.
* Dellen Millard killed his father in 2012 and inherited millions. He and his friend Mark Smich worked together as serial killers both before and after the murder; murdering Laura Babcock and Tim Bosma.
* Henry Chau Hoi-leung killed and dismembered his parents in 2013.
* Robert and Michael Bever killed their parents and 3 siblings in 2015.
* Joel Michael Guy Jr. killed and dismembered both of his parents on the Saturday after Thanksgiving in 2016.
* A 21 year old Turkish man in Bayraklı, İzmir who was studying chemistry, killed his parents by making them drink the cyanide sharbat he had prepared in May 2019.
* Chandler Halderson killed and dismembered both of his parents on July 1, 2021.
* A 19 year old Japanese man in Tosu, Saga Prefecture, killed his parents by stabbing them with a knife in the neck on March 9, 2023.
* David Kozák murdered his father before carrying out the 2023 Prague shootings.

== Notable historical cases ==
* Tullia the Younger, along with her husband, arranged the murder and overthrow of Servius Tullius, her father, securing the throne for her husband.
* Lucius Hostius reportedly was the first parricide in Republican Rome, sometime after the Second Punic War.
* John Parricida (c. 1290–1312) killed his uncle Albert I of Germany and as the result ended the first attempt of the Habsburg to become hereditary kings.
* Mary Blandy (1720–1752) poisoned her father, Francis Blandy, with arsenic in England in 1751.
* Lizzie Borden (1860–1927) was an American woman accused and acquitted of murdering her father and stepmother.

==Legal definition in Roman times==
In the sixth-century AD collection of earlier juristical sayings, the &quot;Digest&quot;, a precise enumeration of the victims&#x27; possible relations to the parricide is given by the 3rd century AD lawyer Modestinus:

<text>RFA &quot;Derwentdale&quot; (A114) was a Dale-class fleet tanker and landing ship (gantry) of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She served during the Second World War.

Built for the Ministry of War Transport, she was taken over by the Admiralty and completed as a Landing Ship Gantry. As such, 15 LCMs could be carried on the ships, with two Gantry cranes, one forward of the ship&#x27;s bridge and one aft, used to lift the landing craft off the deck and lower them to the sea. with accommodation for 150 military personnel.

==Service==
Her maiden voyage was as part of convoy ON-19 to Halifax on 22 September 1941. Later &quot;Derwentdale&quot; took part in the British invasion of Madagascar in 1942, leaving Durban, South Africa on 25 May 1942, and contributing 14 landing craft for the landings at Diego Suarez on 5 May. In November 1942, the British and Americans landed in French North Africa in Operation Torch, with &quot;Derwentdale&quot; taking part in the landings at Arzew near Oran in Algeria on 9 November. She later took part in the invasions of Sicily and Italy. She was damaged by dive-bombing at Salerno in September 1943 and towed to the UK via Malta. Re-engined with engines from the &quot;Denbydale&quot; in February 1946, she returned to service as a tanker, her extra accommodation was used for passengers whilst freighting oil on the Trinidad to UK run. She was decommissioned on 19 May 1959 and was laid up at Rosyth, and offered for sale on 20 October. Sold in December 1959 to Kent Line Canada and renamed &quot;Irvingdale 1&quot;, on 23 July 1966 she was moved to El Ferrol, Spain, to be broken up.

The &quot;Derwentdale&quot; was one of the eight RFA ships to be awarded Battle Honours during World War II, and the only to be awarded them three times (North Africa 1942, Sicily 1943 and Salerno 1943).

<text>RFA &quot;Dingledale&quot; (A144) was a Dale-class fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She was first based at Gibraltar, and served as escort oiler on several Malta Convoys. During Operation Pedestal, together with , she fuelled one cruiser and 24 destroyers in 14 hours. Narrowly escaping damage during a severe air raid in Bône in December 1942, she survived to join the Pacific Fleet Train, and was present for the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. After the war, she carried out routine freighting duties. She was decommissioned on 10 May 1959, and was laid up at Devonport.

<text>RFA &quot;Spabeck&quot; (A227) was one of six coastal water carriers built for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary during the Second World War. During the 1950s she was modified to store high-test peroxide (HTP) for the experimental programme evaluating the feasibility of submarines using HTP operationally. The ship was sold for scrap in 1966.

==Description==
The &quot;Spa&quot;-class ships were designed for harbour duties as water carriers. displaced at normal load and fully loaded. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They were powered by a three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engine that drove a single propeller shaft, using steam provided by one cylindrical boiler. The engine developed and gave a maximum speed of . The ships were armed with a single 12-pounder () gun and two Oerlikon AA guns

==Construction and career==
&quot;Spabeck&quot; ordered in September 1941 from Philip and Son and was laid down on 14 May 1943 at their Dartmouth, Devon shipyard as &quot;Rivulet&quot;. The ship was launched on 21 June and commissioned on 3 September as &quot;Spabeck&quot;. She was modified in 1948 as a HTP tanker to support the experimental submarines , &quot;Explorer&quot; and &quot;Excalibur&quot;. The ship was fitted with ten high-grade aluminium tanks capable of carrying of HTP, of distilled water, and of sulphur-free AVCAT jet fuel that was injected into the submarine&#x27;s combustion chamber to increase its output.

After the end of the programme in the early 1960s, &quot;Spabeck&quot; was laid up at Devonport. She was listed for disposal in January 1966 and put up for sale on 11 March. Purchased by a Belgian shipbreaking company for £10,875, she arrived at Antwerp en route to Willebroek, Belgium, for scrapping on 14 May.

<text>A costermonger, coster, or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables in British towns. The term is derived from the words &quot;costard&quot; (a medieval variety of apple) and &quot;monger&quot; (seller), and later came to be used to describe hawkers in general. Some historians have pointed out that a hierarchy existed within the costermonger class and that while costermongers sold from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, mere hawkers carried their wares in a basket.

Costermongers met a need for rapid food distribution from the wholesale markets (e.g., in London: Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish) by providing retail sales at locations that were convenient for the labouring classes. Costermongers used a variety of devices to transport and display produce: a cart might be stationary at a market stall; a mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow) apparatus or a hand-held basket might be used for light-weight goods such as herbs and flowers.

Costermongers experienced a turbulent history, yet survived numerous attempts to eradicate their class from the streets. Programmes designed to curtail their activities occurred during the reigns of Elizabeth I, Charles I and reached a peak during Victorian times. However, the social cohesion within the coster community, along with sympathetic public support, enabled them to resist efforts to eradicate them.

They became known for their melodic sales patter, poems and chants, which they used to attract attention. Both the sound and appearance of costermongers contributed to a distinctive street life that characterised London and other large European cities, including Paris, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their loud sing-song cry or chants used to attract attention became part of the fabric of street life in large cities in Britain and Europe. Costermongers exhibited a distinct identity. Individuals signalled membership of the coster community through a dress code, especially the large neckerchief, known as a &quot;kingsman&quot;, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. The distinctive identity and culture of costermongers led to considerable appeal as subject-matter for artists, dramatists, comedians, writers and musicians. Parodies of the costermonger and his way of life were frequent features in Victorian music halls. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, but their numbers began to decline in the second half of the 20th century when they began to take up pitches in the regulated markets.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;costermonger&quot; first appeared in written English in the early 16th century. The term &quot;coster&quot; is a corruption of &quot;costard&quot;, a kind of apple; and the word &quot;&quot; means a trader or broker. The first known use of the term &quot;costermonger&quot; occurs in the writings of Alexander Barclay, poet and clergyman, in the &quot;Fyfte Eglog of Alexandre Barclay of the cytezene and vpondyshman&quot; published around 1518. &quot;I was acquaynted with many a hucster [=huckster], with a costardemonger and an hostler.&quot; The derivation of the term &quot;costermonger&quot; appears in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the English language&quot;, published in 1759. Charles Knight&#x27;s &quot;London&quot;, published in 1851, also notes that a costermonger was originally an apple-seller. Although the original costermongers worked as itinerant apple-sellers, the word gradually came to refer to anyone who sold fresh fruit or vegetables from a basket, hand cart or temporary stall. The term can be used to describe anyone who sells goods outdoors or in the streets and has come to be a synonym for &quot;street vendor&quot;.

==Definition and description==
Most contemporary dictionary definitions of costermonger refer to them as retail sellers or street vendors of fresh produce, operating from temporary stalls or baskets or barrows which are either taken on regular routes for door-to-door selling or which are set up in high traffic areas such as informal markets or lining the streets of busy thoroughfares. The &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; defines a costermonger as &quot;a person who sells fruit and vegetables outside rather than in a store&quot; while the &quot;Collins Dictionary&quot; defines a costermonger as &quot;a person who sells fruit or vegetables from a cart or street stand.

Henry Mayhew, a Victorian social commentator, distinguished between itinerant and stationary costermongers in the following terms:
Technically, costermongers were hawkers since they rarely traded from fixed stalls. They filled a gap in the food distribution system by purchasing produce from the wholesale markets, breaking it down into smaller lots and offering it for retail sale. Their fruit and vegetables were placed in baskets, barrows, carts or on temporary stalls. From an economic viewpoint, they provided form utility (breaking down wholesale lots into smaller retail sizes); place utility (making produce available close to shoppers&#x27; place of work or residence) and time utility (making goods available at times that are convenient to shoppers such as when they are on their way to work). Some costermongers walked the streets crying out to sell their produce, while others operated out of unauthorised, but highly organised informal markets, thereby contributing to an informal system of food distribution which was highly valued by the working classes and poorer customers.

While the term costermonger is typically used to describe sellers of fresh produce, primarily fruit, vegetables, fish, and meat, both Victorian commentators and historians point out that costers sold an &quot;astonishly large amount of raw and prepared food.&quot; In their photographic essay, &quot;Street Life in London&quot;, published in 1877, John Thomson and Adolphe Smith depict costermongers selling a variety of fresh and prepared foods as well as beverages—from ginger beer through to iced confections. Mayhew provided extensive descriptions of costers selling potted plants and cut flowers:

Mayhew also pointed out that young coster girls often started out by selling cut flowers and small bunches of herbs:
Images from &quot;Street Life in London&quot;, by John Thomson and Adolphe Smith, 1877
==History==

Costermongers were known to have been in London from at least the 15th century, and possibly much earlier. Mayhew, writing in the 1840s, called costermongering an &quot;ancient calling&quot; and attributed the first written descriptions of the street sellers&#x27; distinctive cries and sales patter appearing in a ballad, entitled &quot;London Lyckpeny&quot; by John Lydgate probably written in the late 1300s and first performed around 1409. Shakespeare and Marlowe mention costermongers in their writings.

Although the term &#x27;costermonger&#x27; was used to describe any hawker of fresh produce, it became strongly associated with London-based street vendors following a surge in their numbers in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were most numerous during the Victorian era, when Mayhew estimated their London numbers at between 30,000 and 45,000 in the late 1840s.

In the decades after the Great Fire of London, a major rebuilding programme led to the removal of London&#x27;s main produce market, Stocks Market, in 1773. The displacement of the open market to a less strategic location led to a period of decline for retail markets. While wholesale markets continued to prosper, retail markets lost their foothold. Costermongers filled the gap by providing inexpensive produce in small quantities to the working classes, who, for their part, worked long hours in arduous occupations leaving them no time to attend markets far from the city centre. With the influx of people in London, in the years after the Industrial Revolution, demand outstripped retail capacity, such that costermongers performed a &#x27;vital role&#x27; providing food and service to the labouring classes.

Throughout the 18th century, the streets of London filled with costermongers and competition between them became intense. To stand out amid the crowd, costers began to develop distinctive cries. Mayhew describes a Saturday night in the New Cut, a street in Lambeth, south of the river,

During the 19th century, costermongers gained an unsavoury reputation for their &quot;low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language.&quot; Mayhew was aware of this reputation, but exhibited an ambivalent attitude towards them. On the one hand, he described them as &quot;usurers&quot; and pointed out that cheating was widespread. Weights were flattened to make products look bigger and heavier, and measures were fitted with thick or false bottoms to give false readings. On the other hand, Mayhew also noted that in his own personal experience, &quot;they are far less dishonest than they are usually believed to be. James Greenwood, a Victorian journalist and social commentator, also used derogatory language to describe costermongers and their markets but was aware of the essential service they provided by noting that the poor would be the ultimate &quot;losers&quot; if they were denied access to the costermongering culture which supported them. The Methodist writer, Godfrey Holden Pike, argued that the Sabbath market was vulgar, but in later writings, he noted that &quot;influential newspapers have often misrepresented him [the costermonger].&quot;

Historians such as Jones have argued that the promulgation of a stereotypical image of costermongers was part of a broader agenda to clear London&#x27;s streets of unruly street vendors, who obstructed traffic in a rapidly growing metropolis that was barely coping with an increasing amount of vehicular traffic and street congestion. In addition, a movement to eradicate Sunday trading altogether was gathering momentum and set its sights on the informal, unregulated retail trade. Broadsheets of the day served to perpetuate costermongers&#x27; stigmatised status by stories of the moral decay that surrounded places where costers congregated.

Initiatives to rid the city of street traders were by no means new to the 19th century. Charles Knight wrote of various attempts to curtail street-based trading during the reigns of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and Charles I (1625–1649). However, from the 1840s, the community of costermongers faced increasing opposition from three distinct quarters: the vestry, which viewed street markets as the focus of public disorder; the movement to abolish Sunday trading; and public authorities who were concerned with the rise of unregulated markets and problems associated with street congestion. Throughout the 1860s, the Commissioner of the Police, Richard Mayne, waged war on costermongers and succeeded in closing several markets while authorities and prominent philanthropists began constructing new covered market places designed to replace street selling.

In London&#x27;s Bethnal Green, hostilities between authorities and costers reached a peak by the late 1870s. The vestry, claiming that costers were obstructing the streets, contributing to street litter and encouraging gambling and prostitution, resurrected an ancient law to prevent street trading at certain times. They created a &quot;Street Regulation Committee&quot; and employed a salaried &quot;Street Inspector&quot; to oversee compliance. They insisted that coffee stalls close by 7.30am daily, precisely when workers, on their way to work, might be in need of a hot drink. Some 700 local residents petitioned against the laws. In spite of the apparent public support, the vestry&#x27;s persistence resulted in many street vendors being fined. Costermongers in the markets of Club Street and Sclater Street were subject to verbal abuse, had their stalls overturned, their barrows and carts impounded and occasionally their products tipped down a nearby drain.

In February, 1888, the &quot;Bethnall Green Costermongers&#x27; and Stallkeepers&#x27; Society&quot; was formed. Its primary aim was to fight prosecutions against costers with the help of a solicitor, who was paid a retainer. When the group learned that similar crackdowns on costers were occurring in St Luke&#x27;s Parish and St Georges Parish, the group broadened its base, by forming the &quot;London United Costermongers&#x27; League&quot;. Public support was very much on the side of the costermongers. Members of the public were skeptical of the vestry&#x27;s motivations and believed that shopkeepers were using the issue to eliminate the cheaper produce in order to reduce competitive pressures. Justice of the Peace, Montagu Williams, visited Sclater Street personally and concluded that the vestry had little cause for complaint. From then on, the justices ensured that stall-holders were given minimal fines, taking much of the steam out of the vestry&#x27;s programme of opposition. The costers also pleaded for assistance from a philanthropist, the Earl of Shaftesbury, who pressed the costers&#x27; case with the vestry. Punitive orders were eventually rescinded.

The events surrounding the costermongers&#x27; resistance to various attempts to eradicate them from the streets only heightened their animosity towards the police, which could be extreme. For many members of the working class, the costermongers&#x27; highly-visible resistance made them heroes. As one historian noted: 
::With the navvies a state of permanent warfare with civil authority was common, but not inevitable; with the London costermongers it was axiomatic.

By the end of the 19th century, the costermongers were in gradual decline. They did not disappear as mobile street-sellers until the 1960s, when the few that remained took pitches in local markets.

==Irish costermongers==
Irish immigrants and their descendants made up a considerable number of the trade all across the major cities and towns of Britain, as can be noted from 19th-century commentaries such as Henry Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;: According to Mayhew,

==Coster culture and style==
Costers developed their own culture; notoriously competitive, respected &quot;elder statespeople&quot; in the costermonger community could be elected as pearly kings and queens to keep the peace between rival costermongers. However, crimes such as theft were rare among costermongers, especially in an open market where they tended to look out for one another. Even common thieves preferred to prey on shop owners rather than costers, who were inclined to dispense &quot;street justice&quot;.

London based costermongers had their own dress code. In the mid-nineteenth century, men wore long waistcoats of sandy coloured corduroy with buttons of brass or shiny mother of pearl. Trousers, also made of corduroy, had the distinctive bell-bottomed leg. Footwear was often decorated with a motif of roses, hearts and thistles. Neckerchiefs—called king&#x27;s men—were of green silk or red and blue. Covent Garden&#x27;s flower sellers were immortalised in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.

Henry Mayhew gave a detailed description of the costermonger&#x27;s attire:

Costers were especially fond of mother-of-pearl buttons. Men decorated the legs of their trousers with a line of pearly buttons. By the 19th century, both men and women began adding these &quot;pearly buttons&quot; to their clothing as James Greenwood describes:

In the 1880s, a man by the name of Henry Croft who had long admired the costermonger&#x27;s way of life as well as their showiness and panache, smothered his worn out suit and accessories with pearly buttons arranged in geometric patterns. Costermongers soon recognised that the public loved these shimmering outfits and began wearing more and more heavily decorated outfits and soon became known as the &quot;Pearly Kings and Queens&quot;.

Betty May spoke of the &quot;coster&quot; style and atmosphere in London, around 1900, in her autobiography &quot;Tiger Woman: My Story&quot;:


Costermongers also developed their own linguistic forms. In the 1800s, they spoke &quot;back slang;&quot; in which ordinary words are said backwards. Examples of back slang include &quot;yob&quot; for &quot;boy&quot;; &quot;ecslop&quot; for &quot;police&quot;; &quot;elbat&quot; for &quot;table&quot; and &quot;yennep&quot; for &quot;penny&quot;. Back slang was used as a secret language, a code which only other costermongers understood. In her book, &quot;Shadows of the Workhouse&quot;, Jennifer Worth observed that &quot;Costers... spoke to each other almost entirely in back slang; incomprensible to an outsider.&quot; Many costermongers also used &quot;rhyming slang&quot;; where any word can be substituted with another word that rhymes with it. Examples of rhyming slang include: &quot;tin lids&quot; or &quot;dustpan lids&quot; for &quot;kids&quot;; &quot;jimmy grant&quot; for &quot;emigrant&quot;; &quot;apple and pears&quot; for &quot;stairs&quot;; &quot;rubbidy dub&quot; for &quot;pub&quot; and &quot;trouble and strife&quot; for &quot;wife&quot;. The selection of rhyming words often suggested a symbolic association. For example, a &quot;sorrowful tale&quot; means &quot;three months in jail.&quot; Following the second world war, condensed versions of popular terms were more commonly used, such that &quot;trouble and strife&quot; meaning &quot;wife&quot; simply became &quot;trouble&quot; and the phrase &quot;down the frog and toad&quot; (meaning &quot;down the road&quot;) would be condensed to &quot;down the frog&quot;. Historians have advanced various explanations for the rise of a unique coster tongue. One possible explanation is that it protected costers from close surveillance.

Both historians and contemporary commentators have pointed to additional distinctive elements of coster culture. In general, they were a hard-working and hard-drinking lot. They were not party political, showed a &quot;complete disregard for the lawful marriage,&quot; were not members of any Church, were intensely loyal to other costermongers, were inclined to lend support to the poor and treated their donkeys very well. They enjoyed relative autonomy in terms of their working hours and appeared to be &quot;under the command of no-one.&quot; Their distinctive identity combined with their highly visible position on London streets led to costermongers becoming a symbol of the working class. As Ian Peddie explains:
Mayhew referred to costermongers as a &quot;dangerous class.&quot; The coster community was seen as the &quot;vanguard of resistance&quot; in the 19th century. Their open hostilities with police drew widespread public support and costers who were &#x27;sent down&#x27; were seen as martyrs and heroes. Historians have pointed to the &quot;subversive potential&quot; of the coster class, because of their ability to make broad social connections that cut across geographic boundaries and &quot;related forms of power and exploitation.&quot;

==In literature and the arts==

Costermongers&#x27; distinctive identity meant that they were prime targets for songwriters and musicians. Mayhew pointed out that a ballad, &quot;London Lyckpeny&quot; written by John Lydgate in about 1409, was a very early example of music inspired by the cries of costermongers as they spruiked cherries and strawberries in the streets. The ballad, is a satire that recounts the tale of a country person visiting London to seek legal remedies after having been defrauded. However, he finds that he cannot afford justice, and is soon relieved of any money he has through his dealings with street sellers, retailers, tavern-keepers and others. A &quot;lyckpeny&quot; (or &quot;lickpenny&quot;) is an archaic term for anything that soaks up money. Lydgate&#x27;s ballad prompted generations of composers to write songs about the distinctive cries of street vendors. By the 18th and 19th centuries, ballads extolling the beauty of the women selling lavender, pretty flowers and water cresses had become a ripe subject for composers of popular songs.

Selected popular 19th-century tunes with references to costermongers
Specific references to costermongers can be found in the novels and plays of the 17th century. Shakespeare, in the play, King Henry IV, (published about 1600) wrote that &quot;virtue is of so little regard in these coster-monger times, that true valor is turned bear-heard.&quot; The playwright, Ben Jonson mentioned costermongers in &quot;Epicœne, or The Silent Woman&quot;, written in about 1609. The character, Morose, a man who craved silence, could &quot;not endure the costermonger&quot; and &quot;swoons if he hears one.&quot; Playwrights, John Ford and Thomas Dekker, also mentioned costers in &quot;The Sun&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1656) in the passage, &quot;Upon my life, he means to turn costermonger, and is projecting how to forestall the market. I shall cry &quot;pippins&quot; rarely.&quot; A popular comedy, &quot;The Scornful Lady&quot; (1616), written by playwrights, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, referred to costers in: &quot;Pray sister, do not anger him, And, then he&#x27;ll rail like a rude costermonger.&quot;

From the 15th century, a tradition of representing ‘street cries’ developed in Europe and reached a peak in 18th and 19th century London and Paris. These works were primarily folios consisting of sets of engravings or lithographs with minimal notation. Nevertheless, these representations have proved to be a valuable source for social historians. One of the first such publications was a French publication, &quot;Etudes Prises Dans let Bas Peuple, Ou Les Cris de Paris&quot; (1737) (roughly translated as &quot;Studies Taken of the Lower People, Or The Cries of Paris&quot;). Two decades later, in England, &quot;The Cries of London Calculated to Entertain the Minds of Old and Young; illustrated in variety of copper plates neatly engrav&#x27;d with an emblematical description of each subject&quot;, was published. and followed by &quot;Cries of London&quot; (1775) and &quot;The Cries of London, as they are daily exhibited in the streets: with an epigram in verse, adapted to each. Embellished with sixty-two elegant cuts&quot; (1775); a highly popular publication with a new edition published in 1791 and in its tenth edition by 1806. Other 18th-century titles included: &quot;The Cries of London: for the Instruction of Good Children; decorated with twenty-four cuts from life&quot;, (1795). Similar titles appeared in the 19th century including: &quot;The New Cries of London; with characteristic engravings&quot; (1804); &quot;The Cries of London; embellished with twelve engravings&quot;, &quot;The Cries of Famous London Town: as they are exhibited in the streets of the metropolis: with twenty humorous prints of the most eccentric characters&quot;; &quot;The Cries of London: shewing how to get a penny for a rainy day&quot;, (1820) Lord Thomas Busby&#x27;s &quot;The Cries of London: drawn from life; with descriptive letter-press, in verse and prose&quot; (1823); James Bishop&#x27;s &quot;The Cries of London: for the information of little country folks; embellished with sixteen neatly-coloured engravings&quot;, (1847); and &quot;The London Cries in London Street: embellished with pretty cuts, for the use of good little boys and girls, and a copy of verses (1833)&quot;.

From the 18th through to the early 20th century, music hall entertainers, songwriters and musicians mined coster culture and language, seeking inspiration for parodies, sketches and songs. Alfred Peck Vance (1838–1888), also known as &quot;The Vance&quot;, was one of the first to exploit the coster image in the music halls. Arthur Lloyd was a composer and singer, who achieved great success with his character-songs in the 1870s, many of which were devoted to the lives of costermongers. Lloyd&#x27;s repertoire, which included songs such as &quot;The Costermonger&#x27;s Song&quot;, unlike other music hall compositions, was less dependent on the ability of the performer to mimic Cockney accents and mannerisms, but rather relied on the lyrics to deliver a &quot;quaintness of fancy&quot; and humour. Other musicians, such as Robert and Harris Weston, drew inspiration from London&#x27;s cockney culture when composing their songs, some of which were often sung in a cockney accent. Coster life and culture was also portrayed in Victorian music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood, Charles Seel, Paul Mill and Gus Elen. Elen was a highly popular performer whose tunes included; &quot;The Coster&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, &quot;The Coster&#x27;s Muvver&quot; and &quot;The Coster&#x27;s Pony&quot;. Chevalier, was a popular comedic entertainer, who himself never worked as a coster, but appeared in character as a costermonger, and sang &quot;The Coster&#x27;s Serenade&quot;, &quot;The Nasty Way &#x27;e Sez It&quot;, and &quot;Funny Without Being Vulgar&quot;. A few costermongers, such as Alec Hurley, made a living composing and performing songs about their own careers as costermongers. &quot;The Costermonger&#x27;s Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Going to the Derby&quot;) was a Lloyd composition. Hurley&#x27;s wife, Marie Lloyd, had some success with tunes he composed including, &quot;The Coster&#x27;s Christening&quot; and the &quot;Costermonger&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. Many of these were pictorial texts, heavily adorned with engravings or lithographs depicting the exuberance of street life in which street vendors were prominently featured.

Selected engravings from works of non-fiction on the theme of costermongers
By the 19th century, writers were using known coster locations as settings for literary works. George Gissing&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;Workers in the Dawn&quot;, published in 1880, described the costermongers at Whitecross Market in the late 1850s. In &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, Swithin Forsyte is driving Irene Forsyte in his carriage through the streets of London in 1886 and a costermonger (the &quot;ruffian&quot;) and his girlfriend are riding alongside in their donkey cart, which is overturned in traffic. Gilbert Chesterton points out that &quot;slum novels&quot;, an early 20th-century genre, showed a great interest in costermongers, although Chesterton, himself, wrote he did not always approve of the novelists&#x27; motives which often came down to writing about the costermonger&#x27;s &quot;dim vices and delicate virtues&quot; and their capacity to create a sensation.

In the 1972 animated television film &quot;Oliver and the Artful Dodger&quot;, a reformed Artful Dodger works as a costermonger dealing in scrap iron to support a group of orphans he&#x27;s rescued from the workhouse.

Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot; features a costermonger mentoring his grandson in the trade in the Covent Garden area of London.

Street life and the &quot;cries of London&quot; was also a recurring theme in European painting. In the mid-1700s, the English water-colourist, Paul Sandby created a series entitled &quot;London Cries&quot; depicting English shopkeepers, stall-holders and itinerant street vendors. The Dutch engraver, Marcellus Laroon began working in London in the mid-1700s where he produced his most famous work, the series, &quot;The Cryes of London&quot;. The Flemish engraver and printmaker, Anthony Cardon, spent time in England in the 1790s where he produced a series of engravings of London&#x27;s street sellers, known as the &quot;Cries of London&quot;. Francis Wheatley, the English painter, who had been born in Covent Garden and was well acquainted with London&#x27;s street life, exhibited a series of artworks, also entitled &quot;Cries of London&quot;, between 1792 and 1795. Augustus Edwin Mulready, made his reputation by painting scenes of Victorian life which included street sellers, urchins, markets flower sellers. The French artist, Louise Moillon, noted for her still-life paintings, also used market scenes, costermongers, street vendors and green-grocers as subject matter in early 17th-century France.

&quot;The Victorian Slum&quot; (&quot;Victorian Slum House&quot; in the US) is a five part documentary, produced by the BBC in 2016, featuring a group of costermonger and tradesman families, living and working in London&#x27;s East End between the 1860s and the early 20th century, and highlighting the plight of the urban poor.

==Social commentary and sources==

The activities and lifestyles of 19th-century costermongers and street vendors are among the subjects documented in various 19th-century texts. Many of these were written by prominent social commentators and journalists, as part of a social reform agenda which emerged during the period. Notable commentators (with selected book titles) include:

* Henry Mayhew wrote &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;, a four volume collection of articles, being an observational account of street life and the working poor, published in 1851. Volume 1 is dedicated to costermongers and street vendors。Henry Mahew wrote extensively about the conditions of London&#x27;s working classes and poor. During the mid-19th century, his output was prolific, publishing a series of 82 letters, surveying the conditions of the nation&#x27;s labouring population in the Morning Chronicle in 1849-1850.; and a series of pamphlets, entitled &quot;The Great World of London&quot;, in 1856 made a number of public appearances in which he used humour, song and costume to bring his characters to the stage and in 1857 gave a series of public readings, promoted as &quot;Oddities of the London Streets&quot; His most well-known work is &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;
* Godfrey Holden Pike, a Methodist writer, published &quot;Byeways of Two Cities&quot;, in 1873 and the &quot;Romance of the Streets&quot; in 1872
* James Greenwood, a Victorian journalist and social commentator, first published an article &#x27;A Mission Among City Savages&#x27;, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and subsequently in a collection entitled, &quot;In Strange Company&quot; in 1873. His commentary relates especially to the street vendors working around Whitecross Street, London. He also wrote, &quot;Toilers in London&quot; in 1883 
* Charles Booth wrote, &quot;Life and Labour of the People in London&quot; a multi-volume book published in 1891. Volume 17 contains commentary on costermongers and their lifestyle.
* John Thomson and Adolphe Smith, collaborated in the production of a monthly magazine, &quot;Street Life in London&quot;, between 1876 and 1877. These were subsequently published as a pictorial essay in book form, also called &quot;Street Life in London&quot; in 1878.

==Legal standing==
The costermonger&#x27;s trade in London is subject to regulation by law, under the administration of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. If the pitch is stationary, by-laws of local councils also apply. Legislation exists under clause six of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 134), which deals with obstruction by goods to pavements (sidewalks) and streets. There are various modern amendments, the first of which occurred mere months after the passing of the original Act.

&quot;Spapool&quot; was purchased commercially in July 1976 at Mombasa and used by Divecon Ltd. as a salvage vessel later that year for the recovery of MV &quot;Southern Pioneer&quot;, a tanker that sank at Tanga, Tanzania. She was used as a bunker barge in Mombasa after the boiler was condemned. The ship sank on Christmas Day 1983, and was salvaged by Divecon Ltd., Mombasa in 1984, and scrapped.

<text>Ed Gebski is an artist from Amsterdam (born 1959 in Heerlen). His monumental canvasses are created in a darkroom where he works with silver-nitrate/oil paint. Only when the paintings are exposed to light do they reveal their colour and presentation. This process is akin to the development of photographs. The paint emulsion is removed after the painting process and then transparent colours remain on the canvas.

In 1994 Gebski won the first prize at the Dutch Prix de Rome. His work also was part of the exposition &quot;Tot zo ver / Up to now&quot;, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam at the end of December 2003.

<text>An uitlander, Afrikaans for &quot;foreigner&quot; (), was a foreign (mainly British) migrant worker during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in the independent Transvaal Republic following the discovery of gold in 1886. The limited rights granted to this group in the independent Boer Republics was one of the contributing factors behind the Second Boer War.
== Second Boer War ==

The vast Witwatersrand gold fields were discovered in 1886, and within ten years the uitlander (English) population of the Transvaal was thought to be double that of the ethnic Boer Transvaalers. These workers were primarily concentrated around the Johannesburg area.

The Transvaal government, under President Paul Kruger, were concerned as to the effect this large influx could have on the independence of the Transvaal. The uitlanders were almost entirely British subjects. Therefore enfranchising the uitlanders, at a time when the Crown was keen to consolidate its colonial hold in South Africa, risked creating a powerful fifth column that could ultimately lead to a power shift and the Transvaal passing into British hands, eventually turning it into a British colony. As a result, beginning in 1890 the Transvaal government passed a series of laws refusing voting rights and citizenship to immigrants who had not both resided in the republic for fourteen years and were over forty years of age. This successfully disenfranchised the uitlanders from any meaningful political role. This attitude was called, &quot;Krugerism&quot;.

This policy, together with high taxation, gave rise to considerable discontent. Their treatment served as the pretext for the Jameson Raid in 1895; Cecil Rhodes planned an invasion of the Transvaal to coincide with an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg. Dr Jameson&#x27;s force invaded, but the expected uprising never took place; the invading force were quickly overpowered and arrested.

From 1897 onwards, the High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Alfred Milner, and the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, used the denial of rights to the uitlanders as their main point of attack against the Transvaal. They encouraged uitlander agitation and pressed uitlander claims, with veiled threat of war, upon Kruger&#x27;s government.

In the end, British insistence and Kruger&#x27;s intransigence led to the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899.

Upon its defeat in 1902, the Transvaal became a British colony. All residents of the Transvaal thereafter became British subjects and so the term uitlander lost prominence.

With the election of a liberal government in Britain, everything was returned to the Boers in 1906.

<text>Richard Gordon Emmett (born July 10, 1953) is a vocalist, guitarist, and member of the Canadian hard rock band Triumph.

==Career==
In Toronto, during the mid 1970s, several local musicians formed a progressive rock group called Act III. One member of the group was Emmett, who left to join Triumph. This led to the break up of Act III. Other members formed Zon. Emmett says that one of the songs he performed with Act III was &quot;The Blinding Light Show&quot;, a tune which he later recorded with Triumph.

Emmett left Triumph in 1988 to pursue a solo career. His first solo album, &quot;Absolutely&quot;, was released in 1990 and became a moderate hit across the United States and Canada thanks to the hits &quot;When a Heart Breaks,&quot; &quot;Big Lie&quot; and &quot;Saved by Love&quot;. He is also a writer for &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine and teaches song-writing and music business at Humber College in Toronto. For a time during the 1980s, Emmett contributed cartoons to &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine satirizing the music industry.
Due to a production error by Gil Moore and Mike Levine on Triumph&#x27;s first album, Emmett changed the spelling of his first name to &quot;Rik&quot; rather than have the album recalled or cause confusion with fans.

Although he is best known as a rock guitarist, his playing style incorporates rock, blues, jazz, classical, bluegrass, and flamenco techniques. Similarly, his songwriting and discography demonstrate his ability to employ and blend multiple genres. In April 2005, he won the Canadian Smooth Jazz Award for Guitarist of the Year.

Emmett is also a proficient singer, splitting lead vocal duties of Triumph with Gil Moore. Emmett&#x27;s voice also has a noticeable resemblance to that of Geddy Lee of Canadian progressive rock band Rush, leading to the band&#x27;s sound sometimes being compared to that of Rush.

In 2007, Emmett joined former Triumph bandmates Gil Moore and Mike Levine for their induction into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame. On Sunday April 6, 2008, at The 2008 JUNO Awards, Triumph was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS).

As a result of positive audience response to their dual guitar work in live shows, Emmett and guitarist Dave Dunlop formed the duo Strung-Out Troubadours. In 2007, they won &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Group/Duo of the Year&#x27; at the Canadian Smooth Jazz Awards, where they were the most heavily nominated act. Both were also nominated for &#x27;Best Guitarist&#x27;.

Emmett&#x27;s 2018 tour with Dunlop may prove to be his last, citing an interest in retirement, or at least an extended break.

As of January 2019, Emmett is on hiatus from touring.

Emmett revealed that he is being treated for prostate cancer in 2024. He also has developed arthritis in his hands.

<text>André Manuel (born 1966 in Diepenheim, Overijssel) is a Dutch singer and performer. Manuel sings in his regional dialect, and is known for his critical and sometimes cryptic lyrics.

His first band was called Fratsen (meaning &quot;antics&quot; in Dutch), formed in 1985. After that group disbanded, he formed Krang, in 1996; they were nominated for an Edison Award in 2000.

Krang split in 2004, and Manuel continued to perform as a solo artist, and published a book entitled &quot;Het Tragische Einde Van De Nederlander Zoals Wij Hem Kennen&quot; (&quot;The Tragic End Of The Dutchman As We Know Him&quot;). In 2015 Manuel won the Poelifinario Award, an important Dutch award for theatrical artists.

Fratsen reunited in 2014 and released the album &quot;Caspar&quot;. They went on tour, and released a second album, &quot;Spookt&quot;, in 2017.

<text>RFA &quot;Abbeydale&quot; (A109) was a fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and was originally one of six ships ordered by the British Tanker Co which were purchased on the stocks by the Admiralty. She was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd and launched on 28 December 1936. &quot;Abbeydale&quot; served until being decommissioned on 18 September 1959 and laid up at HMNB Devonport. She was then sold for scrapping, arriving at the Thos. W. Ward breakers&#x27; yards at Barrow-in-Furness on 4 September 1960.

==Career==
Ordered by the British Tanker Company in 1936, &quot;Abbeydale&quot; was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, Wallsend and launched on 28 December 1936. She was taken over by the Admiralty on 4 March 1937 after completing her sea trials, and on 5 March 1937 sailed from the River Tyne bound for Trinidad on her maiden voyage. She made several voyages between Abadan on the Persian Gulf, and on the outbreak of the Second World War she was returning to the UK from Australia and New Zealand. She sailed to Trinidad in October 1939 and in December was at Kingston, Jamaica. On 29 December 1939 the German newspaper &quot;Bremer Zeituag&quot; falsely reported &quot;Abbeydale&quot; as one of a number of ships that had been sunk. Early 1940 was spent in the Caribbean and Pacific, calling at Callao, Colón, Kingston and Bermuda. On 30 March 1940 she caught fire at Bermuda while moored alongside RFA &quot;Orangeleaf&quot;. Both ships were damaged.

&quot;Abbeydale&quot; returned to the UK in May 1940. She was refitted on the River Clyde in November and December 1940, returning to the Caribbean in early 1941. From there she operated in the South Atlantic, calling at Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo and Port Stanley, Falkland Islands. She underwent repairs at Trinidad in September 1941 and at New Orleans from December 1941 to January 1942. &quot;Abbeydale&quot; arrived at Freetown in February 1942, and sailed from there to Saint Helena. She operated from Saint Helena and into the Atlantic over the next few months, refuelling Royal Navy warships. In October she was refitted at Gibraltar as a defensively equipped merchant ship and in November was assigned to support Operation Torch, the allied invasion of North Africa. For her service she was awarded the battle honour &quot;North Africa 1942&quot;. She sustained some damage that month after colliding with a sunken wreck off Oran, damage that had been repaired by December. In January 1943 &quot;Abbeydale&quot; returned to the UK to undergo more thorough repairs and refitting, and in March sailed for New York with a convoy, before returning to the Mediterranean with a convoy the following month.

In May 1943 she was assigned to Operation Husky, the allied invasion of Sicily. On 18 June 1943 &quot;Abbeydale&quot; sailed from Gibraltar bound for Alexandria in Convoy XTG 2. On 27 June 1943 she was torpedoed by &quot;U-73&quot; off the Algerian coast. There were no fatalities, but &quot;Abbeydale&quot; was severely damaged, breaking in two. HMS &quot;Salvestor&quot; towed the damaged vessel to Algiers, with both parts later towed to Taranto dockyard, the aft section arriving on 14 October 1944 and the fore section on 18 October 1944. Work to reunite the halves did not begin until 30 May 1945, and the repaired &quot;Abbeydale&quot; did not return to service until June 1946.

Postwar, &quot;Abbeydale&quot; spent most of her time sailing between the UK, the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean and the Pacific, with occasional visits to the Caribbean. On 19 June 1954, while sailing from Finnart to the Persian Gulf, she was involved in a collision with the British steamer &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; at Aden. The &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; struck the moored &quot;Abbeydale&quot; while attempting to berth, with both vessels sustaining some damage. On 18 September 1959 &quot;Abbeydale&quot; was laid up at Devonport, and was put up for sale on 5 July 1960. She was sold on 11 August 1960 to British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation for scrapping, and on 4 September 1960 arrived under tow from the tug &quot;Campaigner&quot; at Thos. W. Ward breakers&#x27; yards at Barrow-in-Furness. Her scrapping began on 14 September 1960.

<text>RFA &quot;Arndale&quot; (A133) was a Dale-class fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, originally one of six ships ordered by the British Tanker Company which were purchased on the stocks by the Admiralty. She was decommissioned on 12 August 1959 and was laid up at Rosyth.

==Career==
Ordered by the British Tanker Company in 1936, &quot;Arndale&quot; was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, Wallsend and launched on 5 August 1937. She was taken over by the Admiralty on 28 September 1937 after completing her sea trials, and on 29 September 1937 sailed from the River Tyne bound for Trinidad on her maiden voyage. She went out to the Pacific in 1938, sailing to Auckland, New Zealand via Abadan on the Persian Gulf, before returning to the UK in early 1939. She returned to the Pacific in 1939, and on the outbreak of the Second World War, was travelling back to the UK via the Mediterranean. She arrived at Portsmouth on 31 October, but was involved in a collision with RFA &quot;Distol&quot; at Gosport Oil Fuel Jetty. In November she sailed to Trinidad, returning to the UK in December via Halifax, Nova Scotia.

After undergoing some repairs on the River Clyde in January 1940, &quot;Arndale&quot; returned to Trinidad in February, before travelling on to the River Plate and then Port Stanley, Falkland Islands in April. The rest of the year, and into 1941, was spent in the South Atlantic, with calls at Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo, before sailing to Gibraltar in April 1941. &quot;Arndale&quot; was back in the Caribbean in September 1941, having arrived at Curaçao via Key West and New Orleans. She was once more in service off the South American coastline and in the Caribbean, undergoing repairs at New Orleans from March to April 1942. In May she sailed from Trinidad bound for Cape Town, moving on to Mombasa in July, and then to Durban in November. After a period dry docked between June and July 1943, she sailed to Bandar Abbas in September 1943, she made her way to Trincomalee, via Bombay, Colombo and Addu Atoll. &quot;Arndale&quot; was active in the Indian Ocean, refuelling British, Australian and US warships, before being assigned to Task Force 67 in Operation Transom, a bombing raid on Japanese targets at Surabaya, Java in April 1944. On 30 May &quot;Arndale&quot; was involved in a collision, and was by now suffering from engine defects. She underwent repairs at Brisbane in July 1944, but on 28 August 1944 was again involved in a collision, this time with the cruiser , during refuelling.

&quot;Arndale&quot; returned to the Indian Ocean in September, and moved to Australian waters in November. She refuelled warships of the Royal Australian Navy during this period, before being assigned to Force 69 in January 1945, supporting Force 63 for Operation Meridian I on 24 January, and Operation Meridian II on 29 January. &quot;Arndale&quot; returned to Australia on 7 February 1945, berthing at Fremantle. In February 1945 she sailed to Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, and in March was allocated to Operation Iceberg, the allied invasion of Okinawa. She moved forward to Leyte Gulf in March 1945 with the other auxiliaries and spent the rest of the war attached to the fleet train of the British Pacific Fleet. She was badly damaged by fire in August 1945 and repaired at Brisbane, before visiting Hong Kong in October 1945.

&quot;Arndale&quot; returned to the UK in March 1946 and underwent a refit at Swan Hunter&#x27;s yards. Returning to service, she spent her postwar career making regular voyages between the Pacific, Indian Ocean, Caribbean and the UK, supporting fleet operations. On 19 January 1952 she suffered a flooded engine room in heavy weather while in the North Sea off the Scottish coast. She sent out a mayday, and was attended to by the tugs &quot;Zest&quot; of Invergordon and &quot;Hengist&quot; of, Rosyth, being towed into Rosyth Dockyard on 21 January 1952. Between July and November 1953 she was refitted at Palmers Yard, Hebburn on Tyne, and between January 1955 and February 1956 she was on charter to London &amp; Overseas Freighters. On 12 August 1959 &quot;Arndale&quot; was laid up at Rosyth, and on 4 December 1959 she was advertised for sale. She was sold to a Belgian shipbreaking firm in March 1960 and on 12 April 1960 &quot;Arndale&quot; arrived at Willebroek, Belgium to be scrapped by Sadeica Cie Anonyme. Brussels.

<text>RFA &quot;Bishopdale&quot; (A128) was a Dale-class fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

Ordered in 1936 by the British Tanker Company, London, she was built by Lithgows, Port Glasgow. Acquired by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary before her launch on 31 March 1937, she entered service with them under the name &quot;Bishopdale&quot; in June 1937 after completion of her sea trials. She spent the interwar years sailing between the UK and Caribbean and the Pacific, and from early 1940 was based in the Caribbean. On 14 August 1941 her crew sighted the German cargo ship and blockade runner , which was subsequently scuttled to avoid being captured by the light cruiser and the armed merchant cruiser .

In January 1942 &quot;Bishopdale&quot; sailed for the Pacific, travelling via Henderson Island and arriving at Sydney in April, for service in support of the Royal Australian Navy and other allied forces. She operated in Australian waters and off New Caledonia, refueling Australian and US warships. On 5 August 1942 while sailing from Noumea to Brisbane she entered an Allied minefield and struck a mine, but did not sustain any casualties. She again struck a mine in October 1942 in the Bulgari Passage, New Hebrides and was damaged. She underwent repairs in Sydney which lasted until February 1943. She continued to refuel Australian and US vessels, and on 14 May 1943 was at Cid Harbour simulating being a Japanese aircraft carrier so that the Royal Australian Air Force could practice night bombing on her using bags of flour. In June she moved to Milne Bay, New Guinea to refuel allied ships, and on 18 October collided with the American vessel . &quot;Bishopdale&quot; was undamaged while the &quot;Solon Turman&quot; lost a small life raft from her starboard quarter.

&quot;Bishopdale&quot; was involved in another collision on 11 November 1943, while sailing to Townsville, Queensland in Convoy TN 177. She collided with the aircraft carrier in Cleveland Bay, sustaining damage to her port quarter Oerlikon gun nest supports, while &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;″s paintwork was scratched. From April 1944 &quot;Bishopdale&quot; was at Humboldt Bay, Dutch New Guinea refuelling allied vessels, before moving to San Pedro Bay in November to support allied operations in Leyte Gulf. On 14 December she was struck by a crashing Val dive bomber which hit the starboard upper bridge and then No: 3 wing tank, exploding on contact. One crewmember was killed, and a second mortally wounded. &quot;Bishopdale&quot; sustained considerable damage and was out of action for several months.

After repairs, &quot;Bishopdale&quot; spent the final months of the war at Morotai refuelling Australian and US vessels, before sailing to Subic Bay and then Hong Kong after the surrender of Japan. She returned to the UK in early 1946, and spent the post war years sailing between her posts in the Pacific and the Caribbean, supporting fleet operations. On 8 October 1959 she was laid up at Devonport Dockyard, and on 18 November 1969 was put on the Disposal List. She was offered for sale on 22 November 1969 and again on 29 November 1969, and was sold to a Spanish breaker on 28 January 1970. She left Devonport for the last time on 11 February 1970, under tow for the breakers, and arrived at Bilbao on 17 February for scrapping by Luis Arbulu Arana (Hierros Ardes).

<text>RFA &quot;Broomdale&quot; (A168) was a Dale-class fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She spent much of her career in the Indian Ocean and Far East.

==Construction and design==
The ship was ordered from the British Tanker Company of London from Harland &amp; Wolff and was laid down on 29 December 1936 with Yard number 975. She was one of six tankers purchased during construction by the British Government to allow replacement of worn out ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She was launched as &quot;Broomdale&quot; on 2 September 1937, and was completed on 3 November 1937, entering service the same day.

&quot;Broomdale&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Doxford diesel engines rated at , giving a speed of . &quot;Broomdale&quot; displaced , with a deadweight tonnage of . The ship had a Gross register tonnage of 8334 tons and a Net register tonnage of 4967 tons. The ship had a complement of 40.

==Service== 
While undergoing sea trials at Glasgow on 4 February 1938, &quot;Broomdale&quot; was involved in a collision with the New Zealand Shipping Company&#x27;s cargo passenger ship . &quot;Broomdale&quot; underwent repairs at Greenock. She spent the first year of the war operating between bases in Scotland and Norway, on 16 May 1940 she was attacked by four dive bombers and suffered minor damage from two near misses. Towards the end of 1940 she was moved to operations in the South Atlantic based at Port Stanley.

In April 1942 she was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet at Ceylon. She took part in Operation Stab and spent the next three years fuelling and escorting convoys across the Indian Ocean. On 14 April 1944 she sustained minor damage from the explosion of the ammunition ship , and then in August was accidentally torpedoed by the submarine , rupturing two tanks and killing one.

After a brief trip back to the UK and the end of hostilities she was sent to the Far East, visiting Shanghai, Tokyo, Yokohama and Hong Kong.

She was refitted in 1947 and continued service across the world until sold in November 1959 and broken up two months later.

<text>Ilan Mitchell-Smith (born June 29, 1969) is an American academic and former actor, best known as a co-star of the film &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985) and Andy McCalister in &quot;Superboy&quot;.

==Acting career==
Mitchell-Smith&#x27;s first passion was ballet. He studied as a child and won a scholarship to dance with the School of American Ballet. While there on his scholarship, he was discovered by a casting director and his film career began in 1982 at age 12 when he played a younger version of the title character in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Daniel&quot;. After a starring role in the 1984 film &quot;The Wild Life&quot;, he was cast as Wyatt Donnelly in the 1985 teen film &quot;Weird Science&quot; by writer/director John Hughes. The film focuses on two nerdy teenage boys who create a woman of their own (played by Kelly LeBrock), as they are unable to find girlfriends.

Mitchell-Smith starred in several other films and TV series, most notably &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; and &quot;Superboy&quot;; none of these brought him the same degree of recognition. He decided to leave acting entirely in 1991, his final role being a guest appearance on &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;. Recently, Mitchell-Smith has performed select voiceover work (recording for two episodes—&quot;Moon Warriors&quot; and &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot;—of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Axe Cop&quot;).

In 2017, Mitchell-Smith guest-starred in the fifth-season premiere of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, playing science teacher Mr. Connelly. The episode, entitled &quot;Weird Science&quot;, was based on his film &quot;Weird Science&quot;, with series character Barry Goldberg believing he can make a girlfriend in the same manner as the movie.

==Academic career==
Mitchell-Smith received his A.B. in Medieval Studies from University of California, Davis (UC Davis) and his M.A. in Medieval Studies from Fordham University. He received a doctoral degree from Texas A&amp;M University in 2005. As of January 2020, he is an associate professor in the English department at California State University, Long Beach (CSU Long Beach) in Long Beach, California. For several years prior to his appointment at CSU Long Beach, he was a professor at Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. Mitchell-Smith publishes on chivalry in the later Middle Ages, and he also publishes on cinematic, television, and video-game versions of medieval culture.

<text>Fettes Brot () was a German hip hop group that formed in 1992. In August, 2022 they announced to end their career by the end of 2023.

== History ==
===Band name===
Fettes Brot means &quot;fat bread&quot; in German. &quot;Fett&quot; is a German slang term for &quot;excellent&quot; and brot is slang for &quot;hash&quot;. The band took the name from a fan who called them &quot;Fettes Brot&quot; after an early gig, which was probably meant as a compliment, but the members considered it so bizarre that they took it as the name for their new group. Fettes Brot&#x27;s longevity has meant that they are sometimes referred to as &quot;Hamburg&#x27;s hip hop dinosaurs&quot; by the group members.

===Success with &quot;Nordisch by Nature&quot; and &quot;Jein&quot;===
When the group &quot;Poets of Peeze&quot; disbanded in 1992, its members Dokter Renz (Martin Vandreier) and Tobi Tobsen together with König (&quot;king&quot;) Boris (Boris Lauterbach), Schiffmeister (Björn Warns), and Mighty founded Fettes Brot. The Schmidt brothers (Tobi and Mighty) left the newly founded band early on to pursue other projects, and the band released their first album, the EP &quot;Mitschnacker&quot;, on Yo Mama Records as a trio. Prior to &quot;Mitschnacker&quot;, the songs &quot;Schwarzbrot – Weißbrot&quot; (&quot;Blackbread – Whitebread&quot;) and &quot;Schule der Gewalt&quot; (&quot;School of Violence&quot;) appeared on the sampler &quot;Endzeit 93&quot;, released via the independent record label Wilde Welt Records.

The group&#x27;s first commercial success first came with the single &quot;Nordisch by Nature&quot; (&quot;Nordic by Nature&quot;) and the album from which the single comes. The song begins with the sound of a foghorn and is performed in parts in &quot;Hamburger Platt&quot; (Hamburg Low) north German dialect, a strong Low German accent, and in Danish, which has made the song something of an anthem in Northern Germany. The single remained in the German charts for a full month, but the band was determined not to let this initial commercial success become a one-hit wonder. 

The group demonstrated their technical maturity with their first LP &quot;Auf einem Auge blöd&quot; (&quot;Stupid on one eye&quot;, a parody of the phrase &quot;Auf einem Auge blind&quot; meaning &quot;Blind on one eye&quot;), which boasts versatile and humorous lyrics. The narrated stories and interwoven raps were received very well.

A year later Fettes Brot released their second biggest commercial hit and quasi-anthem &quot;Jein&quot; (a blend of &quot;Ja&quot; and &quot;Nein&quot;, meaning both &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;). The main line of the song&#x27;s chorus asks the question: &quot;Soll ich&#x27;s wirklich machen oder lass ich&#x27;s lieber sein?&quot; (&quot;Should I really do it or should I leave it?&quot;) and led to a strong fanbase being established in German speaking countries. Further singles included &quot;Außen Top Hits, innen Geschmack&quot; (a play on a popular commercial jingle for the aluminum foil Toppits: &quot;Außen Toppits – innen Geschmack&quot; (&quot;Toppits on the outside – flavor within&quot;) where the similar-sounding album title means &quot;Top hits on the outside – taste within&quot;) were just as successful. 

Rapper Dendemann (then a member of &quot;Arme Ritter&quot;, meaning &quot;Poor Knights&quot; but also &quot;French toast&quot;) had his first introduction to the mainstream in his collaboration track &quot;Wildwechsel&quot;, also with Max Herre, Blumentopf, Spax (German) and Der Tobi &amp; das Bo (German), which became representative of these artists. Fettes Brot were at this time very active in other areas: For instance, they created a unique radio transmission called &quot;Forellentee&quot; for Radio Fritz (German).

===Change of direction===
After their initial success, the group began to experiment with a softer sound and released the single &quot;Können diese Augen lügen?&quot; (&quot;Could These Eyes Lie?&quot;) from the album &quot;Fettes Brot lässt grüßen&quot; (&quot;Fettes Brot Says Hello&quot;). Many purists voiced criticism as the band explored new paths and no longer focused on a pure hip hop music style. The songs &quot;Viele Wege führen nach Rom&quot; (&quot;Many Roads Lead to Rome&quot;) and &quot;Lieblingslied&quot; (&quot;Favourite Song&quot;) were successful as a double A-sided single and become an even bigger hit than both previous albums. 

With the cooperation of James Last, the trio took a break from songwriting in 1999 and embarked on a creative pause. The break was announced to fans with via the publishing of an anthology of B-sides, remixes, and some exclusive material. Beginner, and Smudo of Die Fantastischen Vier, as well as Der Tobi &amp; Das Bo made personal contributions to this anthology. Furthermore, the widely successful single &quot;Da draußen&quot; (&quot;Out there&quot;) was released as a collectors edition in 2000.

After three years, in 2001, the fourth Fettes Brot album was released. The trio marketed a small comeback with the title &quot;Demotape&quot; using new alternative pseudonyms. The hit singles &quot;Schwule Mädchen&quot; and &quot;The Grosser&quot; could not be clearly categorized into a musical style. Additionally they released a collaboration with Skunk Funk (German), a pure hip hop single called &quot;Fast 30&quot; (&quot;Almost 30&quot;). Only a year later, in early 2002, they released their greatest hits compilation &quot;Amnesie&quot; (&quot;Amnesia&quot;) and a DVD of the same name with extra short films. Three more singles were released, beginning in 2002 with &quot;Welthit&quot; (&quot;World Hit&quot;), from their greatest hits CD. In 2003, they released the Rio Reiser cover &quot;Ich bin müde&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Tired&quot;), which received extensive exposure on television. They made the collaboration &quot;Tanzverbot&quot; (&quot;Dancing Prohibition&quot;) available as a legal MP3 download (as well as a limited CD and vinyl run), as part of the Hamburg Bambule (German) protest alongside Bela B. against the Hamburg senator Ronald Schill.

===Comeback and founding of the record label===
In 2004, the group founded their own record label, &quot;Fettes Brot Schallplatten&quot; (Fettes Brot Records).

In 2005, they represented Schleswig-Holstein in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005, with the song &quot;Emanuela&quot; placing second with 130 points. A few days later on Valentine&#x27;s Day, the single rose to third place on the singles charts. On 21 May 2005, their most successful album to date was released. The album was titled &quot;Am Wasser gebaut&quot; (literally &quot;Built by the water&quot;, but is also a term describing a very emotional person who cries easily). This album was not as rap-oriented as previous ones and featured more soul influences.

The second single from &quot;Am Wasser gebaut&quot; was &quot;An Tagen wie diesen&quot; (&quot;On days like these&quot;), in collaboration with Pascal Finkenauer (German). The video, in which Finkenauer and DJ exel. Pauly (German) appear, depicts the activities of an ordinary day. It is ordinary, except that armoured tanks drive through the streets as if they were cars and the people take little notice of them.

On 6 October 2005, the three rappers won the Comet Award. They were the first band to win in two categories; they won both the category for &quot;Best Band&quot; and for &quot;Best Song&quot; (&quot;Emanuela&quot;). They were also nominated for &quot;Best Video&quot; and &quot;Most Successful Download&quot; (&quot;Emanuela&quot;).

On 22 December 2005, Fettes Brot gave the largest concert of their career at the Color Line Arena in Hamburg in front of over 13,000 people. The concert was televised by MTV and numerous radio stations (e.g. Radio Fritz) broadcast it live.

===D.O.C.H.!===

Fettes Brot has sometimes used the pseudonym D.O.C.H.! (&quot;doch&quot; which is a German word meaning &quot;yet&quot;, &quot;to the contrary&quot;, and &quot;but&quot;, although most often it means an emphatic, &quot;damn right!&quot; or &quot;yes!&quot;) to publish songs which would not be suitable for the hip hop genre. This began with an extensive PR gag. In January 2006, Fettes Brot announced that they had signed the power pop band D.O.C.H.! to their label. The band was to consist of three 17-year-olds from Berlin named Boy, Paolo, and Typ. News followed promising a first single, a Hungarian tour in April, and the release of an album in September. When the single &quot;Was in der Zeitung steht&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s in the news&quot;) hit radio and television for the first time, a distinct similarity to the B-side of the &quot;An Tagen wie diesen&quot; single was noticed. (Doktor Renz had sung both songs.) After this, fans began to suspect the photos on the band&#x27;s website were counterfeit. An announcement was made on MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot; program on 9 May in which the three members of D.O.C.H.! accused Fettes Brot of having stolen their song.

===Bette Frost and &quot;Strom und Drang&quot;===
In 2006, Fettes Brot released a single named &quot;Fussball ist immer noch wichtig&quot; (&quot;Football is still important&quot;) for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. They also released &quot;Falsche Entscheidung&quot; in 2006 for the World Cup, with a video featuring the retired footballers Boris Amadeus and Stefan Bach. Since both were huge fans of the band they appeared without receiving a fee. After extensive touring in 2005 and 2006, Fettes Brot began work on a new album in 2007. In December, they held several small secret concerts under the name Bette Frost and played the new songs. 

On 1 January 2008, they unveiled the new single &quot;Bettina, zieh dir bitte etwas an&quot; (&quot;Bettina, please put on some clothes!&quot;), but the song was known as &quot;Bettina, pack deine Brüste ein&quot; (&quot;Bettina, tuck your boobs away&quot;) because Fettes Brot had changed it at the last minute. The song is about the German model Bettie Ballhaus, who at the time hosted a late-night quiz show in which, for every question answered correctly, she took some of her clothes off. She also happened to show her breasts, hence the title of the song. However, before the single was released, Ballhaus had left the show. Fettes Brot released this single on 15 February 2008. They also have stopped making soul music and have gone back to the &quot;old&quot; Fettes Brot, making party songs and rap.

Fettes Brot released their new album &quot;Strom und Drang&quot; (&quot;Electricity and Stress&quot;) in March 2008. The album&#x27;s name alludes to an 18th-century epoch of German art and literature, called Sturm und Drang.

* Björn Warns (a.k.a. Björn Beton, Schiffmeister, Flash Müller, Papa Geil)

===Trivia===
Björn Warns took the name &quot;Schiffmeister&quot; from the classic video game &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot;. In that game, when his pirate ship suffered a mutiny, an announcement came up starting with the English words &quot;Shipmaster Warns: ...&quot;. The German language does not have a direct equivalent for &quot;Shipmaster&quot; (&quot;Kapitän&quot; is used instead, as per the English &quot;Captain&quot;), but when Warns translated it he made up the word &quot;Schiffmeister&quot;. Schiffmeister also means &quot;piss master&quot; in the northern German dialect.

Fettes Brot has made a cameo appearance in the German independent movie ABCs of Superheroes (2015)

<text>RFA &quot;Green Rover&quot; (A268) was a small fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), built by Swan Hunter Shipbuilders on the River Tyne, UK and completed in 1969. After decommissioning in 1992 she was sold to the Indonesian Navy and renamed KRI &quot;Arun&quot; (903).

==Design and construction==
The were single-hulled tankers, designed to carry a mixture of fuel oil, aviation fuel, lubricating oil and fresh water supply for services around the globe; they could also carry limited dried stores of such as munitions and refrigerated goods. They were built with a flight deck large enough to accommodate two helicopters, although no hangar was fitted. Although not big enough to support a large task group, these ships were ideal for supporting individual warships or small groups on deployment.

The keel of &quot;Green Rover&quot; was laid at Swan Hunter Shipbuilders Ltd&#x27;s Hebburn yard on the River Tyne, UK on 28 February 1968, she was launched on 19 December the same year, and completed on 15 August 1969. She was in service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary from 1969 until 1992.

== Operational history ==
=== Royal Fleet Auxiliary ===
One of &quot;Green Rover&quot;″s first duties was to attend Navy Days at Chatham, between 31 August and 1 September 1969, where she was open to the public and over 13,000 people visited the ship. In the September she towed the disabled from the North Atlantic to HMNB Devonport.

In November 1970 she departed for a deployment to the Far East, returning by September 1971 where she carried out deck landing trials with the new Harrier jump jet while moored at Greenwich Pier on the Thames.

In 1973 she deployed nine times over three months, between 20 June and 22 September, in support of Royal Navy units operating in support of fishing boats from Britain off Iceland during the Second Cod War. After suffering from a major engine failure while operating as Cod War Station Tanker, she returned to Tyneside for the engines to be replaced in October 1973, by June 1974 this was completed, with the original engines being replaced with two 16-cylinder Crossley-Pielstick diesel engines.

On 17 September 1974, &quot;Green Rover&quot; departed HMNB Devonport to support Task Group 317.2, led by the HMS &quot;Blake&quot;, for deployment in the Far East. The task group also included the s HMS &quot;Achilles&quot;, HMS &quot;Diomede&quot; and HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, the s HMS &quot;Falmouth&quot; and HMS &quot;Lowestoft&quot;, the &quot;Ol&quot;-class &quot;fast fleet tanker&quot; RFA &quot;Olna&quot; and the fleet stores ship RFA &quot;Stromness&quot;. Between 29 March and 26 April 1975, &quot;Green Rover&quot;, along with HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; and HMS &quot;Lowestoft&quot;, were ordered to the coast off South Vietnam, to support a small task force in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth citizens, known as Operation Stella.

&quot;Green Rover&quot; was again involved with the Cod Wars when, between 24 November 1975 and 1 June 1976, she provided support to Royal Navy units during the Third Cod War.

On 26 January 1977 &quot;Green Rover&quot; left HMNB Devonport with and as part of Task Group 317.5, for an Atlantic deployment supporting HMS &quot;Tiger&quot;, the nuclear-powered fleet submarine and six units of the 7th Frigate Squadron, until May. She was again present for a Navy Days, this time at HMNB Devonport during Plymouth Navy Days 1977, the year of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II from 27 August.

1978 saw a six and a half month deployment around the Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific supporting the cruiser HMS &quot;Blake&quot;, which was the Flagship of Task Group 317.7, along with the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate , RFA &quot;Stromness&quot; and the , departing HMNB Portsmouth on 31 May. It formed up with the Devonport group of the Type 21 frigate , the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates and HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, returning to the United Kingdom on 12 December. Notabley she was present off the Virgin Islands with the frigate HMS &quot;Juno&quot; between 5 - 7 July, due to internal security problems.

In 1980 &quot;Green Rover&quot; was deployed providing humanitarian relief off the Cayman Islands in the wake of the Category 5 status hurricane, Hurricane Allen, along with the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate .

She transferred around of fuel to Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic Challenger in August 1985, while attempting to gain the Blue Riband (unfortunately the vessel overturned short of its target and sank without completing its crossing.).

On 27 May 1988 &quot;Green Rover&quot; was placed in reserve on 30 days notice and was laid up in No 3 Basin at HMNB Portsmouth.

&quot;Green Rover&quot; was decommissioned in 1992 from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.
=== Indonesian Navy ===
In April 1992 the ship was purchased by her builders who then resold her to the Indonesian Navy for £6 million. She was towed from Portsmouth to the Tyne renamed &quot;C&quot; to be taken in hand for a four-month refurbishment before re-entering service for her new owners. Commissioned as KRI &quot;Arun&quot; (903), in addition to providing tanker duties, she also became the flagship of the Training Command in the Indonesian fleet. She is still in service as of 2018.

On 19 March 2018 &quot;Arun&quot; took on a severe list during a replenishment operation off Ujung, Surabaya. The exercise was cancelled and she was towed to naval facilities at Surabaya for technical examination.

<text>NRP &quot;Bérrio&quot; (A5210) was a fleet support tanker of the Portuguese Navy. She was built by Swan Hunter in 1969 at Hebburn, England as RFA &quot;Blue Rover&quot; (A270) of the and from 1970 to 1993 was part of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In 1982 during her British service she participated in the Falklands War.

In 1993, she was sold to the Portuguese Navy who renamed her &quot;Bérrio&quot;. She participated in Operation Crocodile (&quot;Operação Crocodilo&quot;) in 1998, as part of the Portuguese naval task force that rescued foreign nationals caught up in the civil conflicts in Guinea-Bissau and then supported the mediators of the CPLP in the peace talks between the parties in the conflict.

The vessel was decommissioned on 1 June 2020.

== Design and construction ==

RFA &quot;Blue Rover&quot;, later NRP &quot;Bérrio&quot;, was a single-hulled tanker of the , although not big enough to support a large task group, she was ideal for supporting individual warships or small groups on deployment.

She was designed to carry a mixture of fuel oil, aviation fuel, lubricating oil and a fresh water supply; she could also carry of limited dried stores, such as munitions and refrigerated goods.

She was fitted with a flight deck large enough to accommodate two helicopters, although she had no hangar.

The keel of &quot;Blue Rover&quot; was laid at Swan Hunter&#x27;s Hebburn yard on the River Tyne, England, on 30 December 1968, she was launched on 11 November 1969. A fire in a fuel tank which was under construction was the cause of death of two plumbers, Lawrence Burdis (aged 24) and John Kinkaid (aged 21), on 9 March 1970. It took thirty firefighters two hours to extinguish it. She commissioned on 15 July 1970. She was in service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary from 1970 until 1993.

== Operational history ==
=== Royal Fleet Auxiliary ===

One of &quot;Blue Rover&quot;″s early major deployments came in February 1971 when she supported the Royal Yacht, HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; in the Pacific Ocean. On 23 February she visited the Pitcairn Islands in support of the visit of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to the island.

In August 1972 &quot;Blue Rover&quot; was involved in &quot;Project Stornoway&quot;. RAF Stornoway, on the Isle of Lewis, in the Western Isles of Scotland, had fuelling tanks which required of Avtur in readiness for a NATO exercise. She was anchored offshore and delivered the fuel through a specially constructed long pipeline in a 22½ hour long operation.

By March 1973 the refit to change unreliable original 16,000 shp diesel engines was completed, being replaced with two 16-cylinder Crossley-Pielstick diesel engines.

May 1973 saw &quot;Blue Rover&quot; deployed in support of Royal Navy units off Iceland during the Second Cod War until June, and then again during September and October. In December she again visited the Pitcairn Islands, in the Pacific, however, she had a fire in the engine room while again supporting the Royal Yacht. HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; towed &quot;Blue Rover&quot; to Tahiti, the largest island of the Windward group, enabling temporary repairs prior to returning to the UK.

She had a busy summer / autumn in 1978, initially she was open to the public during Portsmouth Navy Days over 26, 27 and 28 August and over 20,000 people came onboard during. The following month when the head cook signed off his replacement refused to sign on. The second cook took over, but then he threatened to leave upon &quot;Blue Rover&quot;″s arrival at Faslane, on the Gare Loch, Scotland. Then for the remainder of September she worked with the unique American submarine NR-1, a United States Navy (USN) nuclear-powered ocean engineering and research submarine, in the Irish Sea.

In November 1980, together with the support tanker , she deployed on the Armilla Patrol supporting the and the .

On 16 April 1982 &quot;Blue Rover&quot; departed HMNB Portsmouth for the South Atlantic as an aviation fuel tanker during Operation Corporate. She arrived and then departed from Ascension Island on 26 April, entering the Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) around the Falkland Islands on 2 May. She joined with the and the replenishment oiler and this group was escorted by the County-class destroyer HMS &quot;Antrim&quot; and the on 4 May, before heading for the island of South Georgia, around east of the Falkland Islands, to act as the Station Tanker.

On 18 November 1983, in Operation Offcut, &quot;Blue Rover&quot; was deployed off Lebanon to assist British troops and civilians. She was ordered to stand off Beirut to support the County-class destroyer and the Type 22 frigate , along with sister ship RFA &quot;Grey Rover&quot;, the support tanker and the helicopter support ship .

== Decommissioning and sale ==

On 9 February 1993 she arrived at HMNB Devonport to remove supplies ready for her disposal. On 22 February she sailed for HMNB Portsmouth, arriving the following day. In March 1993 she was sold for £5.5m to the Portuguese Navy and on 31 March she was officially handed over, at Portsmouth.

== Battle honours ==

On 17 August 1984 RFA &quot;Blue Rover&quot; received her Falklands Islands 1982 Battle honour by Mr A. Kemp Director Ships and Fuel (DST (SF)).

<text>RFA &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; (L3029) was the lead ship and prototype of the Round Table class landing ship logistics, an amphibious warfare design operated by the British Armed Forces.

&quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; sailed with the British Task Force that took part in the Falklands War. Whilst in San Carlos Water, an Argentine plane dropped a bomb that penetrated her hull, but the bomb failed to explode.

==Design and construction==
Constructed by Fairfield S&amp;E, the vessel was laid down in March 1962, launched on 25 June 1963, and commissioned on 16 January 1964. As the first of the Round Table class, it also became known as Sir Lancelot class.

==Background==
The ship was initially operated by the British-India Steam Navigation Company, then was transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1970. Round Table class ships were manned by British officers and Hong Kong Chinese sailors from their introduction in 1963 until 1989, when &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; was the last RFA to be crewed in this way.

==Service in United Kingdom==

=== 1970s ===
Sailing out of Singapore, &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; delivered 300 tons of relief supplies for the victims of the West Malaysian flood, which had been donated by the Government and people of Singapore.

===Falklands War===

==== 1980s ====
In 1982, as part of the Amphibious Task Group engaged in the Falklands War, she entered San Carlos Water on 21 May and uniquely remained there for the duration of the conflict. On 24 May at around 10:15, she was hit by a bomb, which failed to explode, from one of four Argentinian Air Force A-4 Skyhawks. This bomb penetrated the starboard side of the ship and she was temporarily evacuated for eight days, pending its removal. This was effected by a team of Clearance Divers from Fleet Team Three and took 22 hours of straight work to achieve. The 1,000lb bomb was removed with the fuse still intact and &#x27;live&#x27; in a protracted and delicate operation that required the removal of an entire sleeping-cabin from the deck above to allow egress of the weapon via chain hoists, sheer-legs and &#x27;...a very long piece of rope&#x27; - with which it was lowered to the sea-bed. For this operation the Team received one Distinguished Service Medal, two Mentions in Dispatches and four C in C&#x27;s Commendations for Brave Conduct. (&quot;Keep Your Head Down&quot; by Commander &#x27;Bernie&#x27; Bruen MBE DSC RN, Commanding Officer FCDT3) The crew were transferred initially to Red Beach, then &quot;RFA Stromness&quot; the next day, and &quot;RFA Sir Tristram&quot; a day later. Thereafter she remained in San Carlos Water providing accommodation and base facilities to a variety of military units.

Following the cessation of hostilities and some repairs, she operated around the Falklands until 26 July, returning to Portsmouth on 18 August, and dumping 25 tons of Argentine munitions into the ocean en route.

==Service in South Africa ==
&quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1989, and sold in June 1989 to the British company Lowline, which renamed the vessel &quot;Lowland Lancer&quot;. She initially operated as a cross-channel ferry on the Weymouth, Dorset to Cherbourg route. This was followed by a spell as the replacement Royal Mail ship while RMS &quot;St Helena&quot; was undergoing repairs. On arrival in Cape Town, the vessel stayed in South Africa and opened as a floating casino.

==Service in Singapore ==

=== 1990s ===
The ship was sold on in 1992 to the Republic of Singapore Navy, was renamed RSS &quot;Perseverance&quot; (L-206), and was commissioned on 5 May 1994 following a two-year refit. &quot;Perseverance&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 9 January to 17 February 2000.

===Glenn Defense===

In December 2003, the ship was sold to Glenn Defense Marine Asia, which renamed the ship &quot;Glenn Braveheart&quot;. According to US Court records relating to the extensive corruption scandal and convictions of very senior US Navy officers and other personnel involving bribery, fraud and &quot;Sex-for-secrets&quot; on the part of Glenn Defense relating to the service and resupply of Navy ships at Asian ports, the vessel would often deploy alongside the USS &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, the 7th Fleet&#x27;s flagship. When in port, the &quot;Braveheart&quot; would serve as &quot;a giant party boat, with prostitutes in the wardroom to entertain US officers.&quot;

==Fate==

In early 2008, the ship was sold for breaking. She was taken to Chittagong, Bangladesh, to be broken up for scrap.

<doc id="527306" wikidata="Q3935946" url="?curid=527306" title="HMAS Choules">
<text>HMAS &quot;Choules&quot; (L100) is a that served with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) from 2006 to 2011, before being purchased by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The vessel was built as RFA &quot;Largs Bay&quot; by Swan Hunter in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear. She was named after Largs Bay in Ayrshire, Scotland, and entered service in November 2006. During her career with the RFA, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; served as the British ship assigned to patrol the Falkland Islands in 2008, and delivered relief supplies following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

At the end of 2010, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was marked as one of the vessels to be removed from service under the Strategic Defence and Security Review. She was offered for sale, with the RAN announced as the successful bidder in April 2011. After modifications to make her more suited for Australian operating conditions, the vessel was commissioned in December 2011 as HMAS &quot;Choules&quot;, named after Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy Chief Petty Officer Claude Choules. A propulsion transformer failure kept the ship out of service between July 2012 and April 2013.

==Design and construction==

The Bay class was designed as a replacement for the logistics ships operated by the RFA. The new design was based on the Royal Schelde Enforcer design; a joint project between the Dutch and Spanish resulting in the and amphibious warfare ships. The main difference with the British ships is the lack of a helicopter hangar. The ships were originally designated &quot;auxiliary landing ship logistics&quot; or ALSL, but this was changed in 2002 to &quot;landing ship dock (auxiliary)&quot; or LSD(A), better reflecting their operational role. Four ships were ordered; two from Swan Hunter, and two from BAE Systems Naval Ships.

The Bay-class ships have a full load displacement of in RFA service; this increased slightly to after modifications for RAN service. &quot;Largs Bay&quot;/&quot;Choules&quot; is long, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion power is provided by two Wärtsilä 8L26 generators, providing , and two Wärtsilä 12V26 generators, providing . These are used to drive two steerable propulsion pods, with a bow thruster supplementing. Maximum speed is , and the Bay-class ships can achieve a range of at . &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was fitted for but not with a Phalanx CIWS and a 30mm DS30B cannon when required for self defence. The RAN&#x27;s webpage for &quot;Choules&quot; does not specify any armament. In British service, the everyday ship&#x27;s company consisted of 60 to 70 RFA personnel, with this number supplemented by members of the British Armed Forces when &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was deployed operationally. The RAN opted to maintain the ship at full operational crewing at all times, with a ship&#x27;s company of 158, including 22 Army and 6 RAAF personnel.
As a sealift ship, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; is capable of carrying up to 1,150 linear metres of vehicles; equivalent to 24 Challenger 2 tanks, 32 M1A1 Abrams tanks, or 150 light trucks. The cargo capacity is equivalent of 200 tons of ammunition, or 24 twenty-foot equivalent unit containers. During normal conditions, a Bay-class ship can carry 356 soldiers, but this can be almost doubled to 700 in overload conditions. The ship does not have permanent hangar facilities. However, a temporary hangar may be fitted and in Australian service the twin-spot flight deck has been extensively utilized with the embarkation of Blackhawk, MRH-90 and
Seahawk helicopters. In the period one year prior to April 2014 the ship had clocked up 1,000 deck landings. The flight deck is capable of accommodating helicopters up to the size of a Chinook heavy-lift helicopter. The well dock can carry one LCU Mark 10, one LCM-8, or two LCVPs (either the Royal Marines version or the Royal Australian Navy version), and two Mexeflotes can be suspended from the ship&#x27;s flanks. The LCM-1E landing craft being acquired by the RAN will not fit into the dock. Two 30-ton cranes are fitted between the superstructure and the flight deck.

&quot;Largs Bay&quot; and sister ship were ordered from Swan Hunter on 18 December 2000. &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was laid down at Swan Hunter&#x27;s shipyard at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear on 28 January 2002; the first ship of the class work started on. The ship was launched on 18 July 2003. The ship was completed and accepted by the Ministry of Defence in April 2006, over a year late. &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was dedicated on 28 November 2006, the second of the class to enter service with the RFA. The Bay-class construction project saw major delays and cost overruns, particularly in the Swan Hunter half of the project. Shortly after &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was handed over, Swan Hunter was stripped from the project, with BAE taking full responsibility for the class and &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; towed to BAE&#x27;s shipyard in Govan for completion in June 2006.

==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===

Four months after entering service, an engine room fire resulted in steering and propulsion issues, requiring &quot;Largs Bay&quot; to be towed to Plymouth for repairs. In late November 2007, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; embarked 815 Naval Air Squadron 215 Flight and left home waters for the Caribbean to conduct counter-drug operations. She visited eleven islands including Barbados, Curaçao, Grand Turk, Martinique, Trinidad and also the USA. Three days after leaving Barbados &quot;Largs Bay&quot;″s patrolling helicopter spotted a small fishing vessel stopped in the water and detained her after a pursuit; of cocaine were recovered, with an estimated £20 million European street value. She participated in Navy Days while in port at Curaçao, where several hundred people toured her.

In late 2008, it was reported that &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was to replace for duties in the Falkland Islands. &quot;Northumberland&quot; was to have left for the Islands in December 2008, but was instead sent for pirate patrol off Somalia.

In early 2010, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was deployed to the Arctic Circle. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the ship was pulled from exercises and sailed on 3 February to deliver a load of relief supplies to Haiti. On 18 February 2010, she arrived at Port-au-Prince and unloaded of supplies plus of rations, while engineers from the ship began work on restoring electricity ashore. On 30 March 2010, she returned home. &quot;Largs Bay&quot;″s actions were recognised in December 2011 with the awarding of the Firmin Sword of Peace.

In August 2010, the ship participated in the Bournemouth Air Festival.

===Decommissioning and transfer===

In December 2010, it was announced that the ship would be decommissioned in April 2011 as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Shortly after marking &quot;Largs Bay&quot; for disposal, the British Ministry of Defence contacted the Chilean government and suggested the vessel as a potential replacement for the landing ship tank vessel &quot;Valdivia&quot;, which was due to leave service. In January 2011, the Australian Department of Defence announced that it was interested in purchasing the vessel for the RAN as a replacement for the heavy landing ship or one of the amphibious warfare ships. Interest in the ship was also shown by Brazil and India.

On 17 March 2011, the Australian Department of Defence announced that the RAN would be bidding for &quot;Largs Bay&quot;; this was followed on 6 April by news that a £65 million (A$100 million) bid had been successful. Sea trials during April showed that the ship was in good condition, although she would have to be modified before entering Australian service, particularly to allow operation in tropical conditions. During a 16-week docking at the A&amp;P Group shipyard in Falmouth, the modifications were made, along with refit work to maintain the ship&#x27;s Lloyds certification. The RAN also acquired two Mexeflote landing rafts for use with the ship.

On 13 August, it was announced that &quot;Largs Bay&quot; would be renamed HMAS &quot;Choules&quot; when commissioned into the RAN. The name comes from Chief Petty Officer Claude Choules, who served in both the Royal Navy and the RAN during his career, and was the last known living participant in World War I. &quot;Choules&quot; is the second RAN vessel to be named after an enlisted sailor, following the submarine . The ship was assigned the pennant number L100, reflecting the 100th anniversary of the RAN&#x27;s origin in 2011. Her motto is &quot;Face Difficulty With Zeal&quot;.

On 14 October, the vessel was handed over to the RAN. She arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia on 10 December, and was commissioned into the RAN on 13 December. &quot;Choules&quot; entered full operational service in early 2012, and is based at Fleet Base East.

===Australia===

On 24 February 2012, &quot;Choules&quot; arrived in Townsville. This was in preparation for a month of amphibious warfare training exercises with the Australian Army&#x27;s 3rd Brigade.

In June 2012, one of the two main electrical transformers involved in the ship&#x27;s propulsion system failed, after an earlier engineers report highlighted &quot;overheating of the propulsion motors and transformers&quot;. Inspection found that insulation failure had short-circuited the transformer, while other transformers aboard showed premature wear. Unable to find an available spare, a new unit had to be ordered from the manufacturer. In June, it was predicted that &quot;Choules&quot; would be out of service for four to five months, but by October, claims were made that the ship would be inoperable until at least January 2013, and if all of the wear-showing transformers were replaced, she would not return to service until April 2013. By December, the faulty transformer had been replaced, and the RAN had decided that although the other transformers (propulsion and others) had been shown to have acceptable levels of wear, all would be replaced before &quot;Choules&quot; was reactivated. These repairs were completed in early 2013, and the ship was assessed as ready to re-enter service on 12 April.

For a short time from July 2013, &quot;Choules&quot; was anchored offshore of the Manus Regional Processing Centre in Papua New Guinea to provide temporary accommodation for Department of Immigration and other personnel, due to a lack of accommodation at the centre. In April 2015, the ship transported 46 Vietnamese asylum seekers back to Vũng Tàu, after their vessel was intercepted at sea on 20 March by Australian border protection units and their claims were rejected after interviews at sea lasting less than 40 minutes.

&quot;Choules&quot;″ operational role was reevaluated after the &quot;Canberra&quot;-class landing helicopter dock ships entered service in 2016, but will likely be kept on to fill the role of the strategic sealift ship envisioned by the 2009 Defence white paper.

In March 2017 &quot;Choules&quot; was sent to Queensland to support recovery after Cyclone Debbie.

&quot;Choules&quot; was deployed to Vanuatu on 30 September 2017 to aid in the rescue of 11,000 people from a volcanic eruption of Monaro Voui.

In January 2020, &quot;Choules&quot; was deployed to the coastal town of Mallacoota in East Gippsland, Victoria, to evacuate thousands of people trapped by bushfires and to ferry them south to Hastings in Western Port Bay.

On 14 February 2021, HMAS &quot;Choules&quot; left Australia for Papua New Guinea with 5 Isuzu fire trucks donated by Queensland Fire and Emergency Services.

On 11 March 2021, Gippsland officially announced Mallacoota as the new ceremonial homeport for HMAS Choules.

&quot;Choules&quot; underwent a major refit between 2020 - 2021 as part of SEA3030-2 Capability Assurance Project, Mid-Life Upgrade (CAP) by A&amp;P Australia.

In May 2022 it was announced that &quot;Choules&quot; would be eventually replaced by one of two sought &#x27;Joint Support Ships&#x27; under Project Sea 2200.

In early 2024 it was revealed that &quot;Choules&quot; had been fitted with a new CEA Technologies radar.

<doc id="527308" wikidata="Q7276486" url="?curid=527308" title="RFA Lyme Bay">
<text>RFA &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; is a Bay-class auxiliary dock landing ship (LSD(A)) of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA). Ordered from Swan Hunter in 2000, the ship was launched in 2005. However, cost overruns and delays saw the shipbuilder removed from the project, and the incomplete ship was towed to Govan for finishing by BAE Systems Naval Ships. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; entered service in late 2007; the last ship of the class to join the RFA.

==Design and construction==

The Bay class was designed as a replacement for the Round Table-class logistics ships operated by the RFA. The new design was based on the Royal Schelde Enforcer design; a joint project between the Dutch and Spanish resulting in the &quot;Rotterdam&quot;-class and &quot;Galicia&quot;-class amphibious warfare ships. The main difference with the British ships is the lack of a helicopter hangar. The ships were originally designated &quot;Auxiliary Landing Ship Logistics&quot; or ALSL, but this was changed in 2002 to &quot;Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary)&quot; or LSD(A), better reflecting their operational role. Four ships were ordered; two from Swan Hunter, and two from BAE Systems Naval Ships.

The Bay-class ships have a full load displacement of . Each is long, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion power is provided by two Wärtsilä 8L26 generators, providing , and two Wärtsilä 12V26 generators, providing . These are used to drive two steerable azimuth thrusters, with a bow thruster supplementing. Maximum speed is , and the Bay-class ships can achieve a range of at . &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; is armed with two 30 mm DS30B cannons, four Mk.44 miniguns, six 7.62mm L7 GPMGs, and two Phalanx CIWS. The standard ship&#x27;s company consists of 60 officers and sailors.

As a sealift ship, &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; is capable of carrying up to 24 Challenger 2 tanks or 150 light trucks in 1,150 linear metres of space. The cargo capacity is equivalent of 200 tons of ammunition, or 24 Twenty-foot equivalent unit containers. During normal conditions, a Bay-class ship can carry 356 soldiers, but this can be almost doubled to 700 in overload conditions. Helicopters are not routinely carried on board, but a temporary hangar can be fitted and the flight deck is capable of handling helicopters up to the size of Chinooks, as well as Merlin helicopters and Osprey tiltrotor aircraft. The well dock can carry one LCU Mark 10 or two LCVPs, and two Mexeflotes can be suspended from the ship&#x27;s flanks. Two 30-ton cranes are fitted between the superstructure and the flight deck.

&quot;Lyme Bay&quot; and sister ship were ordered from Swan Hunter on 18 December 2000. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was laid down at Swan Hunter&#x27;s shipyard at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear on 22 November 2002. The ship was launched on 3 September 2005. The Bay class construction project saw major delays and cost overruns, particularly in the Swan Hunter half of the project. Shortly after &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was handed over to the RFA, Swan Hunter was stripped from the project, with BAE taking full responsibility for the class on 13 June 2006. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was towed to BAE&#x27;s shipyard in Govan for completion, departing on 16 July and arriving on the River Clyde on 22 July. The ship was the last to be built on the River Tyne. BAE completed construction, and &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was dedicated on 26 November 2007; the last ship of the class to enter RFA service.

==Operational history==
&quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was deployed for three years on a Maritime Security Patrol in the Persian Gulf, based in Bahrain, acting in a support role of coalition and allied forces. In June 2012, &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; sailed from Bahrain to return home to undergo a planned refit and regeneration period.

In August 2013, she joined the COUGAR 13 task group. On 16 October 2013 she joined Operation Atalanta, the EU’s counter-piracy force off Somalia; she rejoined the COUGAR group in mid-November.

&quot;Lyme Bay&quot; has deployed for the COUGAR 14 Response Force Task Group exercise.

Between June and December 2015 the ship was on Hurricane watch in the Caribbean and had a Mexeflote and Combat Support Boat (CSB) with their crews from 17 Port &amp; Maritime Regt RLC on board to provide the amphibious capability that had not been seen on APT (North) before. A team of Royal Marines and Royal Engineers were attached on board with a wide range of skill sets along with a Lynx HMA.8 from 234 Flight of 815 Naval Air Squadron for the duration. In September she spent six days off Dominica providing humanitarian and disaster relief following Tropical Storm Erika. This saw the Mexeflote transferring 10 vehicles ashore and 100 tonnes of water and aid, alongside were the HADR team to help the local population. Lyme Bay&#x27;s assistance was also required by The Bahamas just a few weeks later after devastating effects from Hurricane Joaquin. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; finished Atlantic Patrol Tasking (North) in December 2015.

&quot;Lyme Bay&quot; assisted with the search and recovery of EgyptAir Flight 804 which crashed over the Mediterranean Sea on 19 May 2016.

After 17 Port and Maritime Regt proving the true capabilities of the Mexeflote and LSD(A) Bay-class ships working in unison in 2015 during APT (North), both the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and 17 Port and Maritime Regt have secured a 3-year deployment with both LSD(A) and Mexeflote paired respectively.

An extensive refit in Falmouth took place in 2017. Lyme Bay was returned to the fleet after the refit and sea trials were complete on 8 March 2018. April 2019 saw RFA Lyme Bay take part in Exercise Joint Warrior 19-1, off the coast of northwest Scotland.

In May 2021, &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; took over as command vessel of 9 Mine Countermeasures Squadron operating from in Bahrain. In May 2022, &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; returned to the U.K. for a refit. It was reported that she might be selected for conversion to a future Littoral Strike Ship role. However, the conversion itself was delayed and in July 2022 it was reported that the littoral strike role would in fact be assumed by instead. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; herself was earmarked to join &quot;Argus&quot; as part of Littoral Response Group (South), which was to deploy east of Suez in the latter part of 2023. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot; deployed in that role starting in October 2023 with &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; embarking a company from 40 Commando and Commando Raiding Craft (CRC) from 539 Raiding Squadron RM. It is envisaged that &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; will be based at the UK Joint Logistics Support Base in Oman. It was subsequently indicated by the Government that she was to remain, for a time, in the Eastern Mediterranean with &quot;Argus&quot; as part of a broader British regional presence given the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. It was expected to carry aid materials from Cyprus to Gaza, but eventually delivered its aid to Egypt due to unaddressed safety concerns.

In March 2024, maintenance of &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was undertaken at the Larsen &amp; Toubro&#x27;s Kattupalli Shipyard in India. This was the first time that a Royal Navy ship had arrived in an Indian shipyard for maintenance. The ships, escorted by , had transited through the Red Sea to reach India. In April 2024, LRG(S) participated in Maritime Partnership Exercise with Indian Navy&#x27;s Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean. The exercise included stealth frigate . The tasks conducted in the exercise included tactical manoeuvres, boarding ops, surface engagement against simulated asymmetric threats, cross deck visits &amp; cross deck helo ops.

In July 2024, both &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot; deployed to Australia for exercise &quot;Predators Run&quot; which included troops from 40 Commando Royal Marines, and also involved US and Australian forces. In late 2024, &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was reported in the Atlantic and paid a four-day visit to Ghana which was to be followed by visits to Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal along with exercises with regional navies.

<text>RFA &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; is a auxiliary landing ship dock (LSD(A)) of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She is named after Mount&#x27;s Bay in Cornwall. As of 2024, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; is the principal vessel assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Littoral Response Group (North).

==Design and construction==

The Bay class was designed as a replacement for the Round Table-class logistics ships operated by the RFA. The new design was based on the Royal Schelde Enforcer design; a joint project between the Dutch and Spanish resulting in the and amphibious warfare ships. The main difference with the British ships is the lack of a helicopter hangar. The ships were originally designated &quot;Auxiliary Landing Ship Logistics&quot; or ALSL, but this was changed in 2002 to &quot;Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary)&quot; or LSD(A), better reflecting their operational role. Four ships were ordered; two from Swan Hunter, and two from BAE Systems Naval Ships.
The Bay-class ships have a full load displacement of . Each is long, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion power is provided by two Wärtsilä 8L26 generators, providing , and two Wärtsilä 12V26 generators, providing . These are used to drive two steerable propulsion pods, with a bow thruster supplementing. Maximum speed is , and the Bay-class ships can achieve a range of at . &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; is normally unarmed, but is fitted to receive two 30 mm DS30B cannons, two Mk.44 miniguns, six 7.62mm L7 GPMGs, and a Phalanx CIWS. The standard ship&#x27;s company consists of 60 officers and sailors.

As a sealift ship, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; is capable of carrying up to 24 Challenger 2 tanks or 150 light trucks in 1,150 linear metres of space. The cargo capacity is equivalent of 200 tons of ammunition, or 24 Twenty-foot equivalent unit containers. During normal conditions, a Bay-class ship can carry 356 soldiers, but this can be almost doubled to 700 in overload conditions. Helicopters are not routinely carried on board, but a temporary hangar can be fitted and the flight deck is capable of handling helicopters up to the size of Chinooks, as well as Merlin helicopters and Osprey tiltrotor aircraft. The well dock can carry one LCU Mark 10 or two LCVPs, and two Mexeflotes can be suspended from the ship&#x27;s flanks. Two 30-ton cranes are fitted between the superstructure and the flight deck.

&quot;Mounts Bay&quot; and sister ship were ordered from BAE on 19 November 2001. &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; was laid down at BAE&#x27;s shipyard at Govan, Scotland on 25 August 2002. She was launched on 9 April 2004, although it took several attempts to christen the ship, and she received damage after becoming entangled in chains and 25-ton weights during the actual launching. &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; was dedicated on 13 July 2006, the first Bay-class ship to enter service with the RFA. The launching of the ship was included in the film &quot;On a Clear Day&quot; (2005).

==Operational history==
&quot;Mounts Bay&quot; took part in the 2006 Vela Deployment. The deployment lasted from 11 September until 22 November 2006. In total approximately 3,000 British personnel and eleven ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary were involved. This deployment saw for the first time, an vessel, taking part in amphibious operations with a Bay class vessel. The deployment was divided into two phases, the first in local waters and the second in waters off the coast of Sierra Leone. For this deployment she was fitted with the Bowman communications system.

&quot;Mounts Bay&quot; demonstrated her lifting capability by transporting in excess of 130 vehicles, for the passage from the UK via Lisbon to Sierra Leone. After completing the Vela Deployment, she returned to the UK to load vehicles and equipment for Exercise Clockwork in northern Norway. She reached Sørreisa on 9 December. Sørreisa is within the Arctic Circle and is the furthest north any Bay-class vessel has been so far. After discharging her cargo, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; returned to the UK, successfully completing operations from the Equator to the Arctic Circle in the last three months of 2006.

She attended the Dover Maritime Careers Festival on 23–24 March 2007, mooring at the Dover Western Docks. She was also in Fowey on 22 August 2008 for the regatta week. &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; was involved in Exercise Joint Warrior 2008, along with , which acted as the Fleets Amphibious Flagship. and also took part in the two-week exercise off Scotland.

She attended The Tall Ships&#x27; Races event in Belfast Northern Ireland between 14–17 August 2009 which was the finishing line for the competition.

In April 2011, she was deployed as part of the Response Force Task Group&#x27;s COUGAR&#x27;11 deployment.
In early 2012, she joined the aircraft carrier and fleet flagship to participate in Exercise ‘Joint Warrior’ and other training missions with warships from the United States, Norway and the Netherlands.

On Armed Forces Day 2012, 30 June, she fired the salute in Plymouth as she steamed past , with the Earl of Wessex and the First Sea Lord on board.

&quot;Mounts Bay&quot; is scheduled to depart for Exercise COUGAR 2013, with Viking armoured vehicles on board.

In January 2016, she set sail for the Mediterranean, carrying the new Governor of Gibraltar, Ed Davis. She has further been deployed to the Aegean Sea to help NATO forces deal with the European migrant crisis. &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; docked at Gibraltar for one month of repairs.

On 19 May 2016 she was deployed to assist in the search for the missing EgyptAir flight MS804 in the Mediterranean between Crete and Egypt. By June 2016 she was tasked to the European Union&#x27;s Operation Sophia to target Daesh gun and people traffickers.

After undertaking maintenance in Falmouth in March 2017, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; deployed to the Caribbean to provide support during the 2017 hurricane season. She was tasked to assist in HADR operations at Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, and Turks and Caicos Islands in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in September 2017 obtaining widespread media coverage.

In September 2019, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; delivered essential supplies to the Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane Dorian.

In March 2022, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; participated in Cold Response 2022, a multinational NATO military exercise in Norway occurring biennially.

In August 2024, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; was reported to have deployed to the Mediterranean to replace RFA Cardigan Bay stationed there in the context of the Israel-Hamas War and which was returning to the U.K. for refit. In late 2024, &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; herself returned to the U.K. to undergo refit planned to start in January 2025.

<doc id="527311" wikidata="Q2585215" url="?curid=527311" title="Auguste Chapdelaine">
<text>Auguste Chapdelaine, Chinese name Mǎ Lài (; 6 February 1814 – 29 February 1856) was a French Christian missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. France used his death—Chapdelaine was executed by Chinese officials—as a &quot;casus belli&quot; for its participation in the Second Opium War.

==Biography==
Chapdelaine was born on a farm in La Rochelle-Normande, France. By the age of twenty, he had entered the seminary at Coutances. He was ordained a priest for the diocese of Coutances in 1843 and in 1851 joined the Institute of Foreign Missions in Paris. He left from Antwerp in April 1852 to join the Catholic mission in the Guangxi province of China. The Taiping Rebellion led to suspicion of Christians, and foreigners were forbidden to enter the area.

After a stay in Guangzhou, he moved to Guiyang, capital of the Guizhou province, in the spring of 1854. In December, he went, together with Lu Tingmei, to Yaoshan village, Xilin County of Guangxi, where he met the local Catholic community of around 300 people. He celebrated his first mass there on 8 December 1854. He was arrested and thrown into the Xilin county prison ten days after his arrival and was released after sixteen or eighteen days of captivity.

Following personal threats, Chapdelaine returned to Guizhou in early 1855, and came back to Guangxi in December of the same year. He was denounced on February 22, 1856, by Bai San, a relative of a new convert, while the local tribunal was on holiday. He was arrested in Yaoshan, together with other Chinese Catholics, by orders of Zhang Mingfeng, the new local mandarin on 25 February 1856. Chapdelaine was accused of stirring up insurrection and refused to pay a bribe. Condemned to cage torture (&quot;zhanlong&quot;), he was first beaten one hundred times on the cheek by a leather thong, which caused his teeth to fly out, his face mutilated, and his jaw lacerated. He was locked into a small iron cage, which was hung at the gate of the jail. The planks he stood on were gradually removed, placing a strain in the muscles of the neck, and leading to a slow and painful death from suffocation. He had already died when he was decapitated. His head was hung from a tree by his hair. Children were said to have thrown stones at the head until Chapdelaine&#x27;s head fell to the ground and was devoured by street dogs and hogs.

==Diplomacy==
His death was reported by the head of the French missions in Hong Kong on 12 July. The chargé d&#x27;affaires, de Courcy, in Macau learned of the execution on 17 July and filed a vigorous protest on 25 July to the Chinese Imperial Viceroy Ye Mingchen. On 30 July, he sent a report to the French foreign office of the execution. 

The viceroy responded to de Courcy by pointing out that Chapdelaine had already violated Chinese law by preaching Christianity in the interior (the 1844 treaty signed with France only permitted for the propagation of Christianity in the five treaty ports opened to the French), he also claimed that the priest was in a rebel territory and that many of his converts had already been arrested for acts of treason, and the viceroy further claimed that Chapdelaine&#x27;s mission had nothing in common with the propagation of religion.

Under French diplomatic pressure, the mandarin who ordered his death was later demoted. When Britain went to war with China in the same year (commencing the Second Opium War (1856–60)), France initially declared its neutrality, but de Courcy made it known that French sympathy was with the British due to the Chapdelaine incident.

In 1857, de Bourboulon, the French plenipotentiary, arrived in Hong Kong and attempted to negotiate reparations for the execution of Chapdelaine and to revise the treaty. He failed to reach an agreement with Yeh.

Talks continued into December of that year. Viceroy Yeh on 14 December stated that he had received a report that the person who was killed was a member of a triad society with a similar Chinese name to Chapdelaine was executed as a rebel in March, and that this was not the same person as Chapdelaine. He also complained that in the past many French citizens had gone into the interior to preach, and he cited the case of six missionaries who had been arrested and were handed over to French custody. The French embassy found Yeh&#x27;s reply to be evasive, derisory and a formal refusal of French demands. 

== The Second Opium War ==
According to historian Anthony Clark, &quot;there is no doubt Chapdelaine&#x27;s death was exploited for imperialist gain&quot;. The French Empire had many times suffered the death of missionaries for which no military vengeance occurred. The political situation wherein Britain&#x27;s victory was seen as inevitable and the French desire to make its own imperial gains in China, alongside the fact that the French did not have a policy elsewhere of punitive military expeditions to avenge the death of missionaries, has led many historians to conclude that the death of Chapdelaine was merely an excuse used in order to declare war so that France could build its empire.

Lord Elgin, the British High Commissioner for China commented on the French ultimatum given prior to France&#x27;s entry to the war: Gros [the French ambassador] showed me a &quot;projet de note&quot; [draft note] when I called on him some days ago. It is very long and very well written. The fact is, that he has had a much better case of quarrel than we; at least one that lends itself much better to rhetoric.

The Chinese version of Article Six in the Sino-French Peking Convention, signed at the end of the war, gave Christians the right to spread their faith in China and to French missionaries to hold property.

==Recognition and controversy==
Chapdelaine was beatified in 1900. He was canonized on 1 October 2000, by Pope John Paul II, together with 120 Christian martyrs who had died in China between the 17th and 20th centuries. 

Anthony Clark maintains that China&#x27;s version of history is &quot;largely contrived&quot; and completely unsupported, and that notions that Chapdelaine was &quot;a lascivious womanizer&quot; and spy are &quot;unsupportable in any historical records&quot;.

<text>RFA &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; is a Bay-class landing ship dock of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA). Built by BAE Systems, the ship was dedicated into the RFA at the end of 2006.

==Design and construction==

The Bay class was designed as a replacement for the Round Table-class logistics ships operated by the RFA. The new design was based on the Royal Schelde Enforcer design; a joint project between the Dutch and Spanish resulting in the &quot;Rotterdam&quot;-class and &quot;Galicia&quot;-class amphibious warfare ships. The main difference with the British ships is the lack of a helicopter hangar. The ships were originally designated &quot;auxiliary landing ship logistics&quot; or ALSL, but this was changed in 2002 to &quot;landing ship dock (auxiliary)&quot; or LSD(A), better reflecting their operational role. Four ships were ordered; two from Swan Hunter, and two from BAE Systems Naval Ships.

The Bay-class ships have a full load displacement of . Each is long, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion power is provided by two Wärtsilä 8L26 generators, providing , and two Wärtsilä 12V26 generators, providing . These are used to drive two steerable azimuth thrusters, with a bow thruster supplementing. Maximum speed is , and the Bay-class ships can achieve a range of at . For self-defence, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; is armed with two 30 mm DS30B cannons, four Mk.44 miniguns (replaced by .50 heavy machine guns as of 2023), six 7.62mm L7 GPMGs, and two Phalanx CIWS. The standard ship&#x27;s company consists of 60 officers and sailors.

As a sealift ship, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; is capable of carrying up to 24 Challenger 2 tanks or 150 light trucks in 1,150 linear metres of space. The cargo capacity is equivalent of 200 tons of ammunition, or 24 twenty-foot equivalent unit containers. During normal conditions, a Bay-class ship can carry 356 soldiers, but this can be almost doubled to 700 in overload conditions. Helicopters are not routinely carried on board, but a temporary hangar can be fitted and the flight deck is capable of handling helicopters up to the size of Chinooks, as well as Merlin helicopters and Osprey tiltrotor aircraft. The well dock can carry one LCU Mark 10 or two LCVPs, and two Mexeflotes can be suspended from the ship&#x27;s flanks. Two 30-ton cranes are fitted between the superstructure and the flight deck.

&quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; and sister ship were ordered from BAE on 19 November 2001. &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; was laid down at BAE&#x27;s shipyard at Govan, Scotland on 13 October 2003. Plans to launch the ship on 8 April 2005 were frustrated by high winds and unusually low tides; the naming ceremony was carried out that day, and the actual launching took place the next day, with more favourable tide conditions. &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; was dedicated on 18 December 2006, the third of the class to enter service with the RFA.

==Operational history==
&quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; has been deployed as part of the Royal Navy Response Force Task Group, carrying elements of 40 Commando.

In June 2011, the vessel headed to Yemen to aid with the potential evacuation of British citizens affected by the ongoing unrest in the country. In July 2011, she docked at Berbera, and a landing craft from &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; landed two BvS 10 Viking armoured vehicles and Royal Marines of 539 Assault Squadron in Somaliland. They penetrated several miles of &quot;bandit country&quot; to meet up with an important clan chief and take him back to &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; for a meeting with MI6 and Foreign Office officials. This was part of Exercise Somaliland Cougar, an operation to train Somali coastguards in anti-piracy techniques and to establish relationships with tribal leaders.

In 2013, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; exercised with the COUGAR 13 task group.

While east of Suez, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; participated in several exercises including IMCMEX 2014. Upon her return to the UK, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; underwent a major refit in Falmouth followed by sea trials and FOST in April 2017 in preparation for deployment later in the year. By June 2017, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; was back in the Indian Ocean and assisted in the rescue of a crewman from the sunken tanker &quot;Rama 2&quot;.

For the past number of years, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; has been the support ship usually based at supporting Royal Navy mine countermeasures operations as part of Operation Kipion. In May 2021, she was temporarily relieved in that role by . In May 2022 it was reported that the ship had completed refit in Falmouth and was earmarked to return to the Persian Gulf, replacing &quot;Lyme Bay&quot;. In February 2023, the autonomous minehunting vessel RNMB &quot;Harrier&quot; arrived in Bahrain to begin trials of autonomous systems in hot weather. The autonomous vessel was intended to operate from &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot;.

In 2023, it was reported that &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; would eventually be replaced in her mine countermeasures support role by ships that would be acquired and converted into an MCM command and support role for autonomous systems in the RFA. One of these ships was reported as likely to replace &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; and some of the other vessels in 9 Mine Countermeasures Squadron. &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; would then be returned to a primary amphibious operations role.

In April 2024, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean to assist in the delivery of humanitarian supplies to Gaza during the Israel-Hamas War. American soldiers and sailors working on building the Gaza floating pier were reported to use &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; as a dormitory. In August 2024, it was reported that &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; was returning to the U.K. for refit and was being replaced in the Mediterranean by RFA Mounts Bay. The vessel returned to the U.K. in early September. However, due to accute personnel shortages and labour action by RFA sailors over low pay, the movement of the vessel to the Falmouth shipyard for refit was delayed. In October, she was transferred to Falmouth to await refit. She was in reported in dry dock for refit as of February 2025.

<doc id="527320" wikidata="Q1381626" url="?curid=527320" title="Eve of Destruction (song)">
<text>&quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; is a protest song written by P. F. Sloan in mid-1965. Several artists have recorded it, but the most popular recording was by Barry McGuire, on which Sloan played guitar.

The song references social issues of its period, including the Vietnam War, the draft, the threat of nuclear war, the Civil Rights Movement, turmoil in the Middle East and the American space program.

The American media helped to make the song popular by using it as an example of everything that was wrong with the youth culture of the time. Its controversial lyrics caused it to be banned by some American radio stations, &quot;claiming it was an aid to the enemy in Vietnam&quot;.

==Background==
The song was offered to the Byrds as a potential single in the style of their Bob Dylan covers, but they rejected it. The Turtles, another L.A. group, recorded a version instead. The Turtles&#x27; version appeared as a track on their October 1965 debut album &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; in July 1965, shortly after McGuire&#x27;s version was released. The Turtles version was later released as a single in 1970 and hit #100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Lyrical references==
* &quot;You&#x27;re old enough to kill, but not for votin refers to the United States law requiring registration for the draft at age 18. The minimum voting age in most states was 21 until the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment in 1971.
* &quot;And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin refers to the War over Water. The Jordan River is also the location of Jesus Christ&#x27;s baptism by John the Baptist and the beginning of his ministry. Making the river a sacred location for many Christians.
* &quot;If the button is pushed, there&#x27;s no runnin&#x27; away.&quot; refers to mutual assured destruction.
* The song&#x27;s mention of Selma, Alabama, refers to the Selma to Montgomery marches in March 1965. The Jan &amp; Dean version substitutes &quot;Watts, California&quot; in the lyrics, in apparent reference to the Watts riots that occurred in Los Angeles later in 1965.
* &quot;You may leave here for four days in space, but when you return it&#x27;s the same old place&quot; refers to the June 1965 mission of Gemini 4, which lasted just over four days.
* &quot;The pounding of the drums, the pride and disgrace&quot; refers to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the marching band that played as his casket was carried to Arlington National Cemetery.
* &quot;Hate your next door neighbor, but don&#x27;t forget to say grace&quot; refers to simple hypocrisy, according to Sloan.

== Barry McGuire version ==
McGuire&#x27;s recording was made between July 12-15 1965 and released by Dunhill Records. The accompanying musicians were P. F. Sloan on acoustic guitar and &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; session musicians Hal Blaine on drums and Larry Knechtel on bass guitar. McGuire&#x27;s vocal track was not intended to be the final version, but a copy of the rough mix &quot;leaked&quot; out to a disc jockey, who began playing it. The song was an instant hit, and as a result the more polished vocal track was never recorded.

McGuire recalled in later years that &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; had been recorded in one take on a Tuesday morning, with him reading lyrics scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper. He said the following Monday morning he received a phone call from the record company at 7am telling him to turn on the radio, his song was playing. McGuire&#x27;s single hit #1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #3 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1965.

== P.F.Sloan version ==

Sloan recalled: &quot;Barry McGuire was the lead singer for a popular folk group at the time called the New Christy Minstrels. [He had written and sung] his own Number 1 hit, &quot;Green,Green&quot;. He had just left the group and was on his own and looking for material to record. He wound up at my publishing company and was told there was a quirky songwriter he might want to listen to. Barry didn&#x27;t like the song &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; that much. He liked a few other songs of mine better. When he was ready to record he picked four songs, and &quot;Eve&quot; was the fourth to be recorded if there was time. If you listen to the recording, he&#x27;s rushing because of the time constraints and he was reading it for the first time off a piece of paper.&quot; When the record was released &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; was the B-side. 

===Reception===
In the first week of its release the single was at No. 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In August 12 Dunhill released the LP, &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;. It reached its peak of #37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to #1 on the chart, and repeated the feat on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart, where it had debuted at No. 30. McGuire would never again break into the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It went to #1 in Norway for two weeks.

=== Controversy, parodies, and response songs ===
In addition to its being banned in some parts of the U.S., the song was also banned by Radio Scotland. It was placed on a &quot;restricted list&quot; by the BBC, and could not be played on &quot;general entertainment programmes&quot;. It was however featured on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on television one week while in the Top 10.

Researcher Justin Brummer, founding editor of the Vietnam War Song Project. has identified 25 answer records referring to &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;. A group called The Spokesmen released &quot;The Dawn of Correction&quot; which became a Top 40 hit. Singer Tony Mammarella released a positive answer song titled &quot;Eve of Tomorrow&quot;. Johnny Sea&#x27;s 1966 spoken word recording, &quot;Day For Decision&quot;, was also a response to the song, and was a Top 40 hit. The British musician Alan Klein included a parody of the song attacking protest singers, entitled &quot;Age of Corruption&quot;, on his album &quot;Well at Least It&#x27;s British&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The Temptations&#x27; 1970 song &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot; mentions the song title.

The song is prominently featured in the second season episode of &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, entitled &quot;Operation Spoilsport&quot;. The song is played during the fourth-season finale of &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Thunder&quot;.

The song, like many other popular songs of the day, gave its name to a gun truck used by United States Army Transportation Corps forces during the Vietnam War. The truck is on display at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum and is believed to be the only surviving example of a Vietnam-era gun truck.

The song is featured in the soundtrack of &quot;Mafia III&quot;.

The song is played in its entirety in the Italian film &quot;Rose Island&quot; from 2020.

<doc id="527353" wikidata="Q4681382" url="?curid=527353" title="Address munging">
<text>Address munging is the practice of disguising
an e-mail address to prevent it from being automatically collected by unsolicited bulk e-mail providers. 
Address munging is intended to disguise an e-mail address in a way that prevents computer software from seeing the real address, or even any address at all, but still allows a human reader to reconstruct the original and contact the author: an email address such as, &quot;no-one@example.com&quot;, becomes &quot;no-one at example dot com&quot;, for instance.

Any e-mail address posted in public is likely to be automatically collected by computer software used by bulk emailers (a process known as e-mail address scavenging). Addresses posted on webpages, Usenet or chat rooms are particularly vulnerable to this. Private e-mail sent between individuals is highly unlikely to be collected, but e-mail sent to a mailing list that is archived and made available via the web, or passed on to a Usenet news server and made public, may eventually be scanned and collected.

==Disadvantages==
Disguising addresses makes it more difficult for people to send e-mail to each other. Many see it as an attempt to fix a symptom rather than solving the real problem of e-mail spam, at the expense of causing problems for innocent users. In addition, there are e-mail address harvesters who have found ways to read the munged email addresses.

The use of address munging on Usenet is contrary to the recommendations of RFC 1036 governing the format of Usenet posts, which requires a valid e-mail address be supplied in the From: field of the post. In practice, few people follow this recommendation strictly.

Disguising e-mail addresses in a systematic manner (for example, user[at]domain[dot]com) offers little protection.

Any impediment reduces the user&#x27;s willingness to take the extra trouble to email the user. In contrast, well-maintained e-mail filtering on the user&#x27;s end does not drive away potential correspondents. No spam filter is 100% immune to false positives, however, and the same potential correspondent that would have been deterred by address munging may instead end up wasting time on long letters that will merely disappear into junk mail folders.

For commercial entities, maintaining contact forms on web pages rather than publicizing e-mail addresses may be one way to ensure that incoming messages are relatively spam-free yet do not get lost. In conjunction with CAPTCHA fields, spam on such comment fields can be reduced to effectively zero, except that non-accessibility of CAPTCHAs bring the same deterrent problems as address munging itself.

== Alternatives ==
As an alternative to address munging, there are several &quot;transparent&quot; techniques that allow people to post a valid e-mail address, but still make it difficult for automated recognition and collection of the address:

* Content delivery network vendors, such as Cloudflare, offer email address obfuscation services to their clients.
* &quot;Transparent name mangling&quot; involves replacing characters in the address with equivalent HTML references from the list of XML and HTML character entity references, e.g. the &#x27;@&#x27; gets replaced by either &#x27;U+0040&#x27; or &#x27;&amp;#64;&#x27; and the &#x27;.&#x27; gets replaced by either &#x27;U+002E&#x27; or &#x27;&amp;#46;&#x27; with the user knowing to take out the dashes.
* Posting all or part of the e-mail address as an image, for example, no-oneexample.com, where the at sign is disguised as an image, sometimes with the alternative text specified as &quot;@&quot; to allow copy-and-paste, but while altering the address to remain outside of typical regular expressions of spambots.
* Using a client-side form with the e-mail address as a CSS3 animated text logo captcha and shrinking it to normal size using inline CSS.
* Posting an e-mail address with the order of characters jumbled and restoring the order using CSS.
* Building the link by client-side scripting.
* Using client-side scripting to produce a multi key email address encrypter.
* Using server-side scripting to run a contact form.
* Using Base64 to encode the email address.

An example of munging &quot;user@example.com&quot; via client-side scripting would be:

 &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
 var name = &#x27;user&#x27;;
 var at = &#x27;@&#x27;;
 var domain = &#x27;example.com&#x27;;
 document.write(name + at + domain);
 &lt;/script&gt;

The use of images and scripts for address obfuscation can cause problems for people using screen readers and users with disabilities,
and ignores users of text browsers like lynx and w3m, although being transparent means they don&#x27;t disadvantage non-English speakers that cannot understand the plain text bound to a single language that is part of non-transparent munged addresses or instructions that accompany them.

According to a 2003 study by the Center for Democracy and Technology, even the simplest &quot;transparent name mangling&quot; of e-mail addresses can be effective.

==Examples==
Common methods of disguising addresses include:

The reserved top-level domain .invalid is appended to ensure that a real e-mail address is not inadvertently generated.

<doc id="527368" wikidata="Q454738" url="?curid=527368" title="Chris Sawyer">
<text>Christopher Sawyer is a Scottish video game designer and programmer. He is best known for creating &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, which has been considered &quot;one of the most important simulation games ever made&quot;, and the best-selling &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; series.

Sawyer began his career in the early 1980s producing small games for Memotech and developing DOS ports of many Amiga games. From 1994 to 2004 he produced a series of &quot;Tycoon&quot; games, which became hallmarks of the simulation genre. After a period away from the gaming industry in the late 2000s, Sawyer founded the mobile game studio 31X which has handled modern ports of his work. &quot;Wired&quot; has described Sawyer as &quot;one of gaming&#x27;s greatest enigmas&quot; given his legendary contributions to the genre while maintaining little presence online, and rarely agreeing to give interviews.

==Early life==
Sawyer was raised in Scotland. He had an interest in computers and programming from an early age, writing simple scripts in BASIC on a ZX81 at a local store in Doune. Being unable to afford a BBC Micro, Sawyer purchased a Camputers Lynx with which he could write simple programs in machine code. He graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Microprocessor Systems from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow.

==Career==
===Memotech and MS-DOS games (1983–1993)===
Sawyer began to write games in Z80 machine code on his Memotech MTX home computer (which possessed a built-in assembler) and then later on an Amstrad CPC series home computer. He sent tapes containing his games to Memotech, who arranged first publications of his titles. During this period he released a total of 11 Memotech games. One of his games was rejected for publication by Ariolasoft, though the company offered him a job after he graduated. This did not eventuate as Ariolasoft was downsizing by that time. He faced issues with Megastar failing to pay him royalties on continued sales of his games, and the revenue was only enough to buy him a disk drive and printer. From 1988 to 1993, Sawyer worked on MS-DOS conversions of Amiga games and was involved in many projects, including &quot;Virus&quot;, &quot;Conqueror&quot;, &quot;Campaign&quot;, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, &quot;Dino Dini&#x27;s Goal&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In the case of the latter, Sawyer worked to improve on the Amiga version by adding texture mapping to the title.

===&quot;Tycoon&quot; games (1994–2004)===
Inspired by &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroad Tycoon&quot;, Sawyer began to develop his own title which made use of an isometric gameworld system he had been designing as a personal project. His management simulation game &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; was released by MicroProse in 1994 and became a classic of the &quot;tycoon&quot; series of games. A year later, he improved and extended the game, giving it the title &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;. The title sold well, and Sawyer immediately sought to create a sequel.

While working on the basic game engine for this sequel, Sawyer began development of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;. Sawyer had been interested in the engineering aspect of roller coasters for some years, but had only ridden a handful of them, including Wild Mouse at Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Thunder Loop Express at Loudoun Castle. He developed the game in x86 assembly language by himself, using only the services of freelance graphic designer Simon Foster and composer Allister Brimble. Sawyer later used some of the revenue from &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; to travel across Europe and the United States, and developed a lifelong interest in roller coasters. After creating &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;, he again resumed work on the sequel for &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, but again postponed it to create &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;, which launched in 2002.

Upon completing that project, he returned to work on the &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; successor, which finally released in 2004 as &quot;Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion&quot;. The game was built atop the engine used by &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;, which by that point appeared dated, and the AI and user interface were poorly received.
Sawyer also served as a consultant for Atari in the development of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, which was designed by Frontier Developments and released later in 2004. Sawyer had understood that further development of the franchise would require 3D graphics but was not interested and left the work to Frontier.

===Departure from industry (2005–2010)===
In November 2005, Sawyer sued Atari, claiming that they had failed to pay him certain royalties. Atari counter-sued Sawyer for damages in 2007, and the two settled out of court for an undisclosed amount paid to Sawyer in February 2008. Due to a combination of the legal issues with Atari, and a general detest of the violent nature of video games of the time, Sawyer temporarily stepped away from video games after the release of &quot;Locomotion&quot;. In an interview, Sawyer also cited a desire to take a break after working on games for 20 years, to spend more time on his personal interests. Asked about the period by &quot;Wired&quot; he replied that he &quot;made a few trips to ride roller coasters around the world.&quot;

===31X &amp; &quot;Tycoon&quot; rereleases (2010–2017)===
In 2010, Sawyer founded 31X Ltd. which he initially planned to use as a holding company for the &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; intellectual property. However, he saw that there was interest in a mobile version of &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; and a space in the market for simulation games like this, and reworked 31X to be a video game developer focused on mobile games. In addition to Sawyer, several others that worked with him on the &quot;Tycoon&quot; games became part of 31X, including Jacqui Lyons, who worked with Sawyer for more than 20 years, serving as the company&#x27;s executive producer.

31X&#x27;s first product was &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; for iOS and Android, released in 2013, which was assisted with Origin8. Sawyer continued to work with Origin8 to bring the first two &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; games into &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic&quot; released for mobile in December 2016. The game later received ports to Microsoft Windows and macOS in September 2017.

===Second departure (2017–present)===
After the completion of &quot;Classic&quot;, Sawyer &quot;...decided to take a back seat again and devote more time to other aspects of [his] life.&quot; Asked about future projects in 2016 he said &quot;I&#x27;d never rule out creating a new original game but I think it&#x27;s unlikely. I feel like I&#x27;m getting on a bit now age-wise and want to take things a bit easier!&quot; He has also indicated that there is no need for a solo assembly coder such as himself in the modern games industry. Asked about the future in 2020, he replied “I also feel I’ve now created all the games I wanted to create... and working on someone else’s game designs just doesn’t excite me.”

Atari continues to produce titles using the &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; intellectual property under license from Sawyer. He has little involvement with these titles, beyond playing the occasional build. In 2022, Sawyer extended Atari&#x27;s rights to the franchise for another decade. For the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2024, Atari sold a number of art pieces autographed by Sawyer. On 1 November 2024 it was announced that Sawyer had entered into an agreement with Atari to allow them to acquire the &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; intellectual property.

==Development style==
Asked about his philosophy and style for game design, Sawyer indicated that he had &quot;just kind of worked on ideas which I thought were fun at the time.&quot; He has identified a Lego-like approach to his work, in which the player deals with small, individual components that go on to be part of larger, more intricate systems. He has also expressed a dislike of modern 3D graphics, describing this as a reason he let Frontier develop &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;. &quot;The world of games moved on and I didn&#x27;t, and I miss the flawed style and clunky simplicity of games from 20 years ago. I admire the amazing graphics and awesome size and realism of many modern games but for some reason can&#x27;t summon much enthusiasm to play them.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sawyer values privacy, rarely gives interviews and does not have a social media presence. Asked about his relative lack of a public online presence in 2013 he said that social media &quot;takes time away from what I need to concentrate on&quot;; he added in 2016 that he prefers &quot;to let the games do the talking&quot;. He volunteers with the media team at a local primary school. Sawyer travels the world to visit roller coasters as an enthusiast, and gave his &quot;coaster count&quot; at 770 in 2024. He gave his favourites as Taron (Phantasialand, Germany), Zadra (Energylandia, Poland), Balder (Liseberg, Sweden), and Ravine Flyer II (Waldameer, USA).
