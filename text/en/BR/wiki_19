<doc id="514051" wikidata="Q1134454" url="?curid=514051" title="Coro, Venezuela">
<text>Coro is the capital of Falcón State and the second oldest city in Venezuela (after Cumaná). It was founded on July 26, 1527, by Juan de Ampíes as Santa Ana de Coro. It was historically known as Neu-[[Augsburg]] (from 1528 to 1546) by the German Welsers, and Coro by the Spanish colonizers and Venezuelans, the city and buildings were built during the Spanish Empire. It is established at the south of the Paraguaná Peninsula in a coastal plain, flanked by the Médanos de Coro National Park to the north and the Sierra de Coro to the south, at a few kilometers from its port (La Vela de Coro) in the Caribbean Sea at a point equidistant between the Ensenada de La Vela and Golfete de Coro.

It has a wide cultural tradition that comes from being the urban settlement founded by the Spanish conquerors who colonized the interior of the continent. As Neu-Augsburg, it was the first German colony in the Americas under the Welser family of Augsburg (from 1528 to 1546). It was then the first capital of the Spanish Captaincy General of Venezuela (1546-1578) and head of the first bishop founded in South America in 1531. The precursor movement of the independence and of vindication of the dominated classes in Venezuela originated in this region; it is also considered to be the cradle of the Venezuelan federalist movement in the republican era.

Thanks to the city&#x27;s history, culture and its well-preserved Colonial architecture, &quot;Coro and its port La Vela&quot; was designated in 1993 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since 2005 it is on the UNESCO&#x27;s List of World Heritage in Danger.

== Toponymy ==
At its founding the town was called Santa Ana de Coro (there is now an unsuccessful campaign to reinstate the colonial name of the city) in the Spanish style that named new cities in America according to the Catholic calendar, accompanied by a name of Indian origin. According to the tradition the word &quot;coro&quot; derives from the Caquetio word &quot;curiana&quot;, meaning &quot;place of winds&quot;. However, according to the authoritative DRAE Spanish dictionary, the word &quot;coro&quot; in its second meaning means &quot;wind of the northwest&quot;, and comes from the Latin &quot;caurus&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The city was founded on July 26, 1527, by Juan Martín de Ampués, with the name of Santa Ana de Coro. Ampíes covenanted to respect the authority of the Native chief Manaure highest authority of the natives of the region, the Caquetio people, This covenant is broken abruptly in 1529 with the landing at the city&#x27;s first Governor and Captain General Ambrosius Ehinger representing the Welser, an Augsburg banking and trading family. The family received the Province of Venezuela (as &quot;Klein-Venedig&quot;) from the emperor Charles V for exploration, founding cities and exploitation of the resources of this vast territory that stretched from Cabo de la Vela (Guajira Peninsula) to Maracapana (near the city of Barcelona, Anzoátegui). From Coro emerged multiple expeditions to the Venezuelan and Colombian Llanos, the Andes and the Orinoco River in search of El Dorado, which allowed the conquerors to explore these vast territories. The government of the Welsers ends in 1545 for breach of contract and conflict of interests between them and the Spanish conquistadors who explored the territory from other focal points of the Spanish Empire in America. The city is in its early days a &quot;beachhead&quot; or outpost of the Spanish during the conquest and colonization in the western and central Venezuela. From them left the expeditions of exploration and founding of new towns.

Santa Ana de Coro lost the political capital of the Venezuela Province (also known as the Coro Province in official documents of the time) in 1578 to Caracas, motivated by repeated invasions of pirates (Preston Somers Expedition was one) and especially to the harshness of its climate. Finally it was no longer the seat of the bishopric in 1636.

=== Fall and rise ===
During the seventeenth century Coro was hit by a hurricane and invasions of pirates, to the point where it appeared in the charts of English and French of the time with the title of &quot;destroyed.&quot; However, these calamities left intact the countryside, with its productive power, which allowed it to recover slowly. Thus, in the late 18th and early 19th century reaches its colonial peak. Precisely from this period are the best preserved civilian buildings in the city.

In 1795 a slave uprising occurs, and generally dominated social classes in the Sierra de Coro, led by the free zambo José Leonardo Chirino, which was aimed at the elimination of slavery and the establishment of the republican regime known for the time as &quot;the French law&quot;. The movement, which would be the forerunner in the independence process would end in defeat, the capture and killing of rebel leader.

=== Independence ===
In 1806 an expedition landed in the port of La Vela de Coro led by Francisco de Miranda. It was intended to be liberating, but was not greeted with enthusiasm by the locals. The expedition is still important as the precursor of the Spanish American wars of independence and in particular for bringing the tricolor, eventually adopted as the flag of Gran Colombia. It is now the basis for the official flag of three American republics, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. The port of La Vela de Coro was where it was raised for the first time in Venezuela.

During the beginning of the Venezuelan War of Independence, Coro, Maracaibo and Guiana did not comply with the provisions of the Junta Suprema de Caracas on April 19, 1810, remaining loyal to Spanish rule. Subsequently, formed a bulwark of the Spanish Empire to land on its coasts the troops that end up destroying the First Republic of Venezuela. In 1821, finally the Coro Province incorporates to the process of independence, with the capture of the city by the troops led by the heroine Josefa Camejo and a group of patriots who came a long time plotting. By the time the General Rafael Urdaneta invades from Maracaibo commanding the Grancolombian army, and the city had been released a few days earlier for the Coro army commanded by Camejo.

The War of Independence and later the civil wars of the 19th century (including the Federal War that began in Coro) leaving the city deserted and destroyed its field, which plunged her into a period of decline that would recover the half- well into the 20th century with the construction of oil refineries in the Paraguaná Peninsula and the changes in Venezuela following the passage of a rural to an urban and oil country.

Since the early 50s Coro was declared a National Heritage.

== Geography ==

Coro is located at north of the Coro region, transition between the Venezuelan Coastal Range and the Cordillera de Mérida. Located on a coastal plain of xerophyte vegetation (19 msn) covering the entire western Falcón state and reaches its narrowest point just in the city, closing a few miles east of Coro by foothills of the Sierra de Falcón. To the north lies the Médanos Isthmus, named for it found in a formation of dunes or sand fields that have been formed by persistent trade winds and ocean currents. The isthmus connects the Paraguaná Peninsula with the mainland. at south of the city are the foothills of the Sierra de Falcón.

=== Climate ===
Due to its extremely high potential evapotranspiration, Coro has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) despite receiving an average of approximately of rainfall per year over 50.1 precipitation days. Humidity remains at a similar level year-round. The highest rainfall occurs between October and December, while March is the driest month. The average temperature is , with minimum temperatures of and maximum . The city is sunny, averaging over 3100 hours of sunshine a year, with January being the sunniest month. It is characterized by strong winds that can register speeds of .

On 29 April 2015, Coro recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Venezuela. Coro has never recorded a temperature below .


== Politics and government ==

Because of its status as capital of the state, Coro is the urban center around which political life of Falcón. It is the political and administrative capital, where is the seat of state government, among others, the Regional Council Legislature, the Governor, the courts and the seat (rector) of the Universidad Nacional Experimental Francisco de Miranda, as well as, the vast majority of representations of national government bodies. It is also the capital of Miranda municipality, to which are added the municipal agencies.

The governor and the municipality is currently led by supporters of President Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías in a Venezuela&#x27;s political map is also mostly covered by governors and mayors Chávez trend (MVR). However, in the December 2007 elections, the referendum on constitutional reform proposal, this party and political groups who accompanied him at the time, were the first defeat after eight years of successive electoral successes. Coro margin than in the rejection of the reform (&quot;NO&quot;) was 57.08%. In relation to the regional elections of November 2008 the Mayor was obtained by the ruling party (PSUV), although in the city its candidate for governor of the state got fewer votes, when the city was characterized by votes ruling party.

In the September 2010 elections to the National Assembly Coro and the rest of the municipalities of Falcón and the Miranda municipality formed the circuit number 3 of the state. For the ruling party PSUV&#x27;s bid was for retired Gen. Melvin Lopez Hidalgo, while the table of democratic unity MUD was for Gregorio Graterol, former candidate for governor of the state. With more than 52% of the vote, the opposition candidate for MUD Gregorio Graterol wins the seat on the circuit assembly, representing the fourth consecutive defeat of Chavismo in the city (the 2007 reform, the government in 2008, amendment in 2009 and parliamentary elections in 2010)

== Conservation and World Heritage Site ==

The city has inherited a monumental architecture of the colonial and republican times features typical of the Andalusian architecture (southern Spain), with materials and techniques used by Native Americans based in the mud, like adobe and wattle, which gives it a unique personality. Equally characteristic has a certain pattern that combines traditional Spanish checkerboard layout with an irregular shape typical of medieval German cities, product of the period in which the city was the seat of the domain of Welser. In the central town, some streets end abruptly, breaking the regularity of the Spanish checkerboard. Ambrosius Alfinger (German of the house of the Welsers and first Governor of the Province of Venezuela) restructures the layout of the streets based on the original layout of the founding of the city.

With its earthen constructions unique in the Caribbean, Coro is the surviving example of the rich fusion of indigenous traditions with the Spanish Mudéjar architectural techniques and irregular shape of German Welser architecture. It is one of the first colonial cities, was founded in 1527, and its colonial architecture prevails until today. Over 600 buildings have been appointed in Coro as heritage.

The historic centre remains characteristics typical of a city of the 18th and 19th centuries, with cobbled stone streets and colonial buildings. This is an important colonial city resort and the largest complex of colonial temples in Venezuela. It contains a variety of museums with a broad representation of Catholic iconography or national historical value, so it is called &quot;la ciudad museo&quot;. For these reasons it is declared, along with its nearby port of La Vela de Coro, a World Heritage Site on December 9, 1993, by Unesco in meeting held in the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias.

Since 2005 Coro has been officially listed as an &quot;endangered&quot; World Heritage Site (see List of World Heritage in Danger). Climate change in Venezuela, in particular heavy rains, have caused significant damage to its rich architecture. Coro&#x27;s traditional buildings were built with techniques based on the use of earth (adobe, and earth reinforced with a plant structure in a technique called &quot;bahareque&quot;). Many of these buildings are vulnerable to heavy rains, as in its natural state earth is a material of low resistance to moisture.

As well as the damage from rains between November 2004 and February 2005, the built environment had, according to UNESCO, been adversely affected by the construction of inappropriate walls and fences. There has also been concern about the construction of a new monument, beach walkways and a gateway to the city in the port of La Vela de Coro: these could have a considerable impact on the value of the site.

In 2018 it was noted that while information provided by the &quot;State Party&quot; (i.e. Venezuela) demonstrated satisfactory advances in the implementation of many corrective measures, further information and actions were needed to ensure that the key issues previously identified as affecting the property have been adequately addressed.

=== Monuments and tourist attractions ===

From its historic colonial architecture to its diverse landscapes, Coro provides various forms of tourist attraction. In the extreme northeast of the city are the Médanos de Coro National Park, large dunes that are the only desert in Venezuela. They are located along the road that runs between the colonial area of the city to the port of La Vela de Coro. The colonial town, a World Heritage Site, preserves a typical urban landscape of the 18th and 19th centuries, with its cobbled streets and hundreds of historic and traditional buildings. Some architectures reflects a Mudéjar style, while others reflect the cultural influence of the Netherlands through the colony of Curaçao. In the city there are interesting Catholic and secular buildings, that were the scene of numerous events of historic significance, since the early republican period. Probably the architectural influences of Coro are unique.

<doc id="514067" wikidata="Q430856" url="?curid=514067" title="PowerPC G4">
<text>PowerPC G4 is a designation formerly used by Apple to describe a &quot;fourth generation&quot; of 32-bit PowerPC microprocessors. Apple has applied this name to various (though closely related) processor models from Freescale, a former part of Motorola. Motorola and Freescale&#x27;s internal name of this family of processors is PowerPC 74xx.

Macintosh computers such as the PowerBook G4 and iBook G4 laptops and the Power Mac G4 and Power Mac G4 Cube desktops all took their name from the processor. PowerPC G4 microprocessors were also used in the eMac, first-generation Xserves, first-generation Mac Minis, and the iMac G4 before the introduction of the PowerPC 970.

Apple completely phased out the G4 series for desktop models after it selected the 64-bit IBM-produced PowerPC 970 processor as the basis for its PowerPC G5 series. The last desktop model that used the G4 was the Mac Mini. The last portable to use the G4 was the iBook G4, which was replaced by the Intel-based MacBook. The PowerBook G4 was replaced by the Intel-based MacBook Pro.

The PowerPC G4 microprocessors were also popular in other computer systems, such as the AmigaOne series of computers and the Pegasos from Genesi. Besides desktop computers the PowerPC G4 was popular in embedded environments, like routers, telecom switches, imaging, media processing, avionics and military applications, where one can take full advantage of the AltiVec technology and its SMP capabilities.

==PowerPC 7400==
The PowerPC 7400 (code-named &quot;Max&quot;) debuted in August 1999 and was the first processor to carry the &quot;G4&quot; moniker. The chip operates at speeds ranging from 350 to 500 MHz and contains 10.5 million transistors, manufactured using Motorola&#x27;s 0.20 μm HiPerMOS6 process. The die measures 83 mm2 and features copper interconnects.

Motorola had promised Apple to deliver parts with speed up to 500 MHz, but yields proved too low initially. This forced Apple to take back the advertised 500 MHz models of Power Mac G4. The Power Mac series was downgraded abruptly from 400, 450, and 500 MHz processor speeds to 350, 400, and 450 MHz while problems with the chip were ironed out. The incident generated a rift in the Apple-Motorola relationship, and reportedly caused Apple to ask IBM for assistance to get the production yields up on the Motorola 7400 series line. The 500 MHz model was reintroduced on February 16, 2000.

=== Design ===
Much of the 7400 design was done by Motorola in close co-operation with Apple and IBM. IBM, the third member of the AIM alliance, designed the chip together with Motorola in its Somerset design center, but chose not to manufacture it, because it did not see the need back then for the Vector Processing Unit. Ultimately, the G4 architecture design contained a 128-bit vector processing unit labelled AltiVec by Motorola while Apple marketing referred to it as the &quot;Velocity Engine&quot;.

The PowerPC 970 (G5) was the first IBM-manufactured CPU to implement VMX/AltiVec, for which IBM reused the old 7400 design they still had from the design they did with Motorola in Somerset. The Xenon CPU in the Xbox 360 also features VMX, with added proprietary extensions made especially for Microsoft. POWER6, introduced in 2007, is IBM&#x27;s first &quot;big iron&quot; CPU to also implement VMX.

With the AltiVec unit, the 7400 microprocessor can do four-way single precision (32-bit) floating point math, or 16-way 8-bit, 8-way 16-bit or four-way 32-bit integer math in a single cycle. Furthermore, the vector processing unit is superscalar, and can do two vector operations at the same time. Compared to Intel&#x27;s x86 microprocessors at the time, this feature offered a substantial performance boost to applications designed to take advantage of the AltiVec unit. Some examples are Adobe Photoshop which utilises the AltiVec unit for faster rendering of effects and transitions, and Apple&#x27;s iLife suite which takes advantage of the unit for importing and converting files on the fly.

Additionally, the 7400 has enhanced support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) thanks to an improved cache coherency protocol (MERSI) and a 64-bit floating point unit (FPU), derived in part from the 604 series. The 603 series had a 32-bit FPU, which took two clock cycles to accomplish 64-bit floating point arithmetic.

The PowerPC G4 family supports two bus technologies, the older 60x bus which it shares with the PowerPC 600 and PowerPC 7xx families, and the notably more advanced MPX bus. Devices that utilize the 60x bus can be made compatible with either 6xx or 7xx processors, enabling a wide variety of offerings and a clear and cheap upgrade path while keeping compatibility issues at a minimum. There are primarily two companies manufacturing system controllers for 7xx and 7xxx computers, Tundra with their Tsi1xx controllers and Marvell with their Discovery controllers.

==PowerPC 7410==
The PowerPC 7410 &quot;Nitro&quot; is a low-power version of the 7400 but it was manufactured at 180 nm instead of 200 nm. Like the 7400 it has 10.5 million transistors. It debuted in the PowerBook G4 on 9 January 2001.

The chip added the ability to use all or half of its cache as high-speed, non-cached memory mapped to the processor&#x27;s physical address space as desired. This feature was used by embedded systems vendors such as Mercury Computer Systems.

==PowerPC 7450==
The PowerPC 7450 &quot;Voyager&quot;/&quot;V&#x27;ger&quot; was the only major redesign of the G4 processor. The 33-million transistor chip extended significantly the execution pipeline of 7400 (7 vs. 4 stages minimum) to reach higher clock speeds, improved instruction throughput (3 + branch vs. 2 + branch per cycle) to compensate for higher instruction latency, replaced an external L2 cache (up to 2 MB 2-way set associative, 64-bit data path) with an integrated one (256 KB 8-way set associative, 256-bit data path), supported an external L3 cache (up to 2 MB 8-way set associative, 64-bit data path), and featured many other architectural advancements. The AltiVec unit was improved with the 7450; instead of executing one vector permute instruction and one vector ALU (simple int, complex int, float) instruction per cycle like 7400/7410, the 7450 and its Motorola/Freescale-followers can execute two arbitrary vector instructions simultaneously (permute, simple int, complex int, float). It was introduced with the 733 MHz Power Mac G4 on 9 January 2001. Motorola followed with an interim release, the 7451, codenamed &quot;Apollo 6&quot;, just like the 7455. Early AmigaOne XE computers were shipped with the 7451 processor.

The enhancements to the 745x design gave it the nicknames G4e or G4+ but these were never official designations.

==PowerPC 7445 and 7455==
The PowerPC 7455 &quot;Apollo 6&quot; was introduced in January 2002. It came with a wider, 256-bit on-chip cache path, and was fabricated in Motorola&#x27;s 0.18 μm (180 nm) HiPerMOS process with copper interconnects and SOI. It was the first processor in an Apple computer to pass the 1 GHz mark.
The 7445 is the same chip without the L3 cache interface.
The 7455 is used in the AmigaOne XE G4, and the dual 1 GHz Power Mac G4 (Quicksilver 2002)

==PowerPC 7447 and 7457==
The PowerPC 7447 &quot;Apollo 7&quot; is slightly improved from the 7450/55, it has a 512 KB on-chip L2 cache and was manufactured in a 130 nm process with SOI, hence drawing less power. It has 58 million transistors. With the 7447A, which introduced an integrated thermal diode as well as DFS (dynamic frequency scaling) Freescale was able to reach a slightly higher clock. The 7447B is effectively a 7447A with even higher frequency scaling, with clock rates up to 1.7 GHz officially and easily up to 2.4 GHz through overclocking. The 7457 and 7457A have an additional L3 cache interface, supporting up to 4 MB of L3 cache, up from 2 MB supported by the 7455 and 7450. However, its frequency scaling stagnated when Apple chose to use the 7447(s) instead of the 7457(s), despite the 7457 being the L3 cache-enabled successor to the L3 cache-enabled 7455 that Apple used before.

The only companies that offer the 7457 in the form of upgrades for the Power Mac G4, iMac G4, and Power Mac G4 Cube are Giga Designs, Sonnet Technology, Daystar Technology (they use the 7457 only for iMac G4 upgrades) and PowerLogix. The Pegasos computer platform from Genesi also uses 7447 in its Pegasos-II/G4.

The 7457 is often used to repair an AmigaOne XE CPU module; some AmigaOS software with the 7457 installed may mistake the AmigaOne for a Pegasos II computer as there were never any official 7457 boards released by Eyetech.

==PowerPC 7448==

The PowerPC 7448 &quot;Apollo 8&quot; is an evolution of the PowerPC 7447B announced at the first Freescale Technology Forum in June 2005. Improvements were a larger 1 MB L2 cache, a faster 200 MHz front side bus, and lower power consumption (18 W at 1.7 GHz). It was fabricated in a 90 nm process with copper interconnects and SOI.

PowerPC 7448 users were:

* Daystar for their High-Res Aluminum PowerBook G4 upgrades (Daystar&#x27;s Low-Res Aluminum PowerBook G4 upgrades used the 7447A, not the 7448)
* NewerTech for their Power Mac G4 upgrades
* PowerLogix for their Power Mac G4 Cube upgrade
* Cisco in NPE-G2 network processor module for their 7200VXR routers 
* Cisco 7201 Router 
* Extreme Engineering Solutions for their XPedite6244 single board computer 
* Aitech for their C104 CompactPCI single board computer 
* Emerson Network Power for their PmPPC7448 PMC module 

== e600 ==
In 2004, Freescale renamed the G4 core to e600 and changed its focus from general CPUs to high-end embedded SoC devices, and introduced a new naming scheme, MPC86xx. The 7448 was to be the last pure G4 and it formed the base of the new e600 core with a seven-stage, three-issue pipeline, and a powerful branch prediction unit which handles up to sixteen instructions out-of-order. It has an enhanced AltiVec unit capable of limited out-of-order execution and a 1 MB L2 cache.

<text>Heino Heinrich Reichsgraf von Flemming (8 May 1632 – 1 March 1706) was a Saxon, later Brandenburger army leader and field marshal and Governor of Berlin.

Flemming was born in Martenthin into an old noble Brandenburg family that probably emigrated from the Netherlands. He was the third-born son of Jakob von Flemming and Barbara von Pfuel. After a comprehensive education at German universities, Flemming fought the Ottoman Turks as a colonel of auxiliary troops in the service of Brandenburg. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, sent him to the King of Poland in 1672. After serving William of Orange excellently several times, Flemming eventually came to serve in the Brandenburg army, although in times of peace he served in other armies. Because of his ability and bravery he received many offers to change services, and in 1682 became a &quot;Feldmarschallleutnant&quot; (roughly the equivalent of a two-star general) in the Saxon army. Commanding the Saxon auxiliary troops, he contributed to the delaying of the Turks before Vienna in 1683.

On 15 February 1684 he became commander of Saxon troops and became a field marshal after the death of Baron von der Goltz on 8 September 1688.

In this and the following year he commanded the Saxon troops on the Rhine under Elector John George III. However, he was suspended for multiple personal offenses, which hurt him deeply. The Austrian generals accused him of corruption. He left the Saxon army and became a marshal with the Brandenburg army, one of four field marshals who did so (the other three being John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, Derfflinger, and Spaen). Flemming commanded successfully in Flanders and retired in 1698 for health reasons.

In 1691, he was made regimental chef of the 1st Prussian Infantry Regiment, a position which he held until 1698.

In 1667, he married Agnes Dorothea von Schwerin, niece of Otto von Schwerin, President of the Elector of Brandenburg&#x27;s Privy Council. 1674 he married Dorothea Elisabeth von Pfuel († 1740), daughter of Georg Adam von Pfuel (1618–1672), royal Prussian General of the Cavalry, Governor of Spandau Citadel, Lord of Groß- und Klein-Buckow (Märkische Schweiz). They had four sons and two daughters.

<doc id="514072" wikidata="Q38967" url="?curid=514072" title="Herding dog">
<text>A herding dog, also known as a stock dog or working dog, is a type of dog that either has been trained in herding livestock or belongs to one of the breeds that were developed for herding. A dog specifically trained to herd sheep is known as a sheep dog or shepherd dog, and one trained to herd cattle is known as a cattle dog or cow dog.

==Herding behavior==

All herding behavior is modified predatory behavior. Through selective breeding, humans have been able to minimize the dog&#x27;s natural inclination to treat cattle and sheep as prey while simultaneously maintaining the dog&#x27;s hunting skills, thereby creating an effective herding dog.

Dogs can work other animals in a variety of ways. Some breeds, such as the Australian Cattle Dog, typically nip at the heels of animals (for this reason they are called &quot;heelers&quot;) and the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis were historically used in a similar fashion in the cattle droves that moved cattle from Wales to the Smithfield Meat Market in London but are rarely used for herding today.

Other breeds, notably the Border Collie, get in front of the animals and use what is called &quot;strong eye&quot; to stare down the animals; they are known as &quot;headers&quot;. The &quot;headers&quot; or fetching dogs keep livestock in a group. They consistently go to the front or head of the animals to turn or stop the animal&#x27;s movement. The &quot;heelers&quot; or driving dogs keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. The Australian Kelpie and Australian Koolie use both these methods and also run along the backs of sheep so are said to head, heel, and back. Other types such as the Australian Shepherd, English Shepherd and Welsh Sheepdog are &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;loose eyed&quot;, working more independently. The New Zealand Huntaway uses its loud, deep bark to muster mobs of sheep. Belgian Malinois, German Shepherd Dogs and Briards are historically &quot;tending&quot; dogs, who act as a &quot;living fence&quot;, guiding large flocks of sheep to graze, while preventing them from eating valuable crops and wandering onto roads.

Herding instincts and trainability can be measured when introducing a dog to livestock or at noncompetitive herding tests. Individuals exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

==Terminology==
In Australia, New Zealand and the United States herding dogs are known as &quot;working dogs&quot; irrespective of their breeding. Some herding breeds work well with any kind of animals; others have been bred for generations to work with specific kinds of animals and have developed physical characteristics or styles of working that enhance their ability to handle these animals. Commonly mustered animals include cattle, sheep, goats and reindeer, although it is not unusual for poultry to be handled by dogs.

The term &quot;herding dog&quot; is sometimes erroneously used to describe livestock guardian dogs, whose primary function is to guard flocks and herds from predation and theft, and they lack the herding instinct. Although herding dogs may guard flocks their primary purpose is to move them; both herding dogs and livestock guardian dogs may be called &quot;sheep dogs&quot;.

In general terms when categorizing dog breeds, herding dogs are considered a subcategory of working dogs, but for conformation shows they usually form a separate group.

Australia has the world&#x27;s largest cattle stations and sheep stations and some of the best-known herding dogs, such as the Koolie, Kelpie, Red and Blue Heelers are bred and found there.

== Origins of herding dogs ==
Creating herding dog breeds is associated with the development of cattle breeding. Domestication of sheep and goats began in the 8–7th millennium BC. Originally this process began in Western Asia, on the territory of modern Iran and Iraq. Shepherding was a difficult task: primitive herders did not have horses and moved their cattle for grazing on foot as horses and donkeys were not yet fully domesticated and obedient enough. Dogs that were previously helping humans in hunting, became assistants in livestock maintenance. The main task for dogs in the early stages of cattle breeding was protecting herds from a variety of wild predators, that were very numerous. 

This function predetermined herding dogs&#x27; characteristics: they had to be strong, vicious, courageous, decisive, able to stand alone against a large predator and, most importantly, ready to defend their herd. The history of the ancestors of herding dogs can be traced back to six thousand years ago, archaeological findings of the joint remains of sheep and dogs date back to 3685 BC. The place of their origin is considered to be the territories of modern Turkey, Iraq and Syria. Shepherd dogs are mentioned in the Old Testament, the writings of Cato the Elder and Varro, their images are found in works of art created more than two thousand years ago. These dogs were used not only to guard herds, but also for military purposes.

From the regions of Western Asia, herding spread to west and north, followed by an increase in the number of domestic animals. On the territory of Europe, the progenitors of herding dogs appeared in the 6th to 7th centuries BC. According to archaeological research, cattle breeding and agriculture spread across Europe in different ways: along the Danube and Rhine rivers to the territory of modern Germany, northern France and the Netherlands, through the Mediterranean Sea to the Alps, up the Rhone to central and southwestern France.

The development of agriculture, increasing number of settlements and foundation of cities have led to a decrease in the number of predators. After the extinction of large predators in most of Europe and Great Britain, with the massive spread of sheep breeding and with an increase in the share of cultivated and populated land, the main task of herding dogs was to protect crops, private and protected areas from harm during grazing and moving herds. Shepherd dogs were more suitable for this work than larger and stronger breeds, being medium-sized and mobile. Such dogs managed small and large livestock, as well as domestic birds. In addition to the Central European type of shepherd, another type of dog has emerged, often with thick hair, more suitable for colder areas. These dogs have shown not only the ability to manage the herd, but also to protect it. With the spread of reindeer breeding among the northern peoples, hunting spitz-like dogs were &quot;retrained&quot; into shepherds.

Most breeds of Central European shepherd dogs – with erect ears and short hair on the head, similar to wolves, were mainly formed in the 16th to 17th centuries, the breeds of curly-haired dogs of the Northern European type were formed later.

== Physical characteristics ==

During the selection process, the physical characteristics of the dogs were formed, allowing them to do their job in the best possible way. Regardless of the conditions in which herding dogs work and what function they perform, they all have a number of common characteristics. Herding dogs are strong and have a lot of stamina. Their paws are well protected from thorns and sharp stones: toes are compressed into a tight lump, paw pads are thick, claws are strong. The coat has structure and density to protect from getting wet and temperature extremes common in the region of the breed origin. All herding dogs have excellent eyesight and hearing. Cattle dog colors are varied and depend on local breeders&#x27; preferences, but all herding dogs should have well-pigmented eyelids, lips, nose and paw pads, because pink skin is too delicate and prone to wounds and sunburn.

==In the modern world==

In countries where herding is preserved, herding dogs continue to work for their main purpose and are appreciated as effective and even irreplaceable helpers that can save labor costs and avoid investments in expensive equipment. Economic studies in Australia have shown that herding dogs are worth more than five times their cost, including training and maintenance. Meanwhile, the popularity and the number of herding dogs are growing, and the scope of work for them is narrowing.

In the 21st century herding dogs are often chosen as family pets. The collie breeds including the Bearded Collie and Border Collie are well known, as are the Australian kelpie and Australian Working kelpie, Welsh Corgis. They make good family dogs and are at their best when they have a job to do. These dogs have been bred as working dogs and need to be physically and mentally active. They retain their herding instincts and may sometimes nip at people&#x27;s heels or bump them in an effort to &#x27;herd&#x27; their family, and may need to be trained not to do so. Their activity level and intelligence makes them excellent canine athletes. The Australian Shepherd, Shetland Sheepdog, Rough Collie, Smooth Collie and Old English Sheepdog are more popular as family companion dogs.

Dogs of herding breeds now often live in urban or suburban neighbourhoods. Their owners need to maintain their physical and mental health, taking into consideration their herding instinct and qualities. The services of dog-trainers are in demand, along with the training centres for working and sporting herding dogs, offering sheep rental and walks in the pasture. Dogs living in the suburbs and villages can work with small groups of animals or poultry. Sometimes owners even buy a few sheep so that their dogs can enjoy what they were originally bred for.

The combination of quick learning ability, physical strength, endurance, predatory behavior with dedication to the owner and a desire to work has led to the widespread use of large European Shepherds for a number of other civil and military jobs. These are the most common police and military dogs employed in the guard, search, rescue and other types of services. The modern world presents people with new tasks, which are successfully solved with the help of dogs. For example, in the United States, legally protected geese often pose serious problems for life and work. Here, border collies and other strong-eyed herding dogs are used to patrol crops, residential and recreational areas, parks, beaches, golf courses and, above all, airports. Protection from birds with the help of herding dogs turned out to be the most effective and only easily implemented way: walking through the patrolled area several times a day, the dogs force the geese to settle in places where they cause less trouble, while the nature is not being harmed.

All shepherd dogs are born athletes. Their high need for physical and intellectual activity can be replenished not only by sports grazing, but also by other types of cynological sports. Border Collies are owners of outstanding sports qualities, Belgian Shepherds, Australian Shepherds invariably occupy leading positions in agility, flyball, frisbee, dog dancing, obedience. At the same time, in service, sport and show dogs of herding breeds that do not interact with livestock, the herding instinct is gradually weakened.

===Competitive herding===

The competitive dog sport in which herding dogs move animals around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers is called a &quot;sheepdog trial&quot;, &quot;herding test&quot; or &quot;stockdog trial&quot; depending on the area. Such events are particularly associated with hill farming areas, where sheep range widely on largely unfenced land. These trials are popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Chile, Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and other farming nations, and have occasionally even become primetime television fare.

In the US, regular events are run by the United States Border Collie Handler&#x27;s Association, Australian Shepherd Club of America, American Kennel Club and many others.

The world record price for a working border collie, Liz was broken May 2024 at the Ray White Livestock Rockhampton Working Dog Sale at Gracemere sale yards, Greenland, with £32,150.00 ($40,000) for James and Helen Parker. The previous record was in 2023 at £26,508.07 ($33,000) which was Liz&#x27;s half brother, Sid and was sold to the same people, James and Helen Parker who bought Liz in 2024.

===Basic herding dog commands===

* Come by or just by - go to the left of the stock, or clockwise around them.
* Away to me, or just away or way - go to the right of the stock, or counterclockwise around them.
* Stand - stop, although when said gently may also mean just to slow down.
* Wait, (lie) down or sit or stay - stop, but remain with that contact on the stock...do not take it off by leaving.
* Steady or take time - slow down.
* Cast - gather the stock into a group. Good working dogs will cast over a large area. This is not a command but an attribute.
* Find - search for stock. A good dog will hold the stock until the shepherd arrives. Some will bark when the stock have been located.
* Get out or back - move away from the stock. Used when the dog is working too close to the stock, potentially causing the stock stress. Occasionally used as a reprimand.
*Keep away or keep - Used by some handlers as a direction and a distance from the sheep.
* Hold - keep stock where they are.
* Bark or speak up - bark at stock. Useful when more force is needed, and usually not essential for working cattle and sheep.
* Look back - return for a missed animal. Also used after a shed is completed and rejoined the flock or packet of sheep.
* In here or here - go through a gap in the flock. Used when separating stock.
* Walk up, walk on or just walk - move in closer to the stock.
* That will do - stop working and return to handler.

These commands may be indicated by a hand movement, whistle or voice. There are many other commands that are also used when working stock and in general use away from stock. Herding dog commands are generally taught using livestock as the modus operandi. Urban owners without access to livestock are able to teach basic commands through herding games.

These are not the only commands used: there are many variations. When whistles are used, each individual dog usually has a different set of commands to avoid confusion when several dogs are being worked at one time.

<text>Urdu poetry ( ) is a tradition of poetry and has many different forms. Today, it is an important part of the culture of India and Pakistan. According to Naseer Turabi, there are five major poets of Urdu: Mir Taqi Mir (d. 1810), Mirza Ghalib (d. 1869), Mir Anees (d. 1874), Muhammad Iqbal (d. 1938) and Josh Malihabadi (d. 1982). The language of Urdu reached its pinnacle under the British Raj, and it received official status. All famous writers of Urdu language including Ghalib and Iqbal were given British scholarships. Following the Partition of India in 1947, it found major poets and scholars were divided along the nationalistic lines. However, Urdu poetry is cherished in both the nations. Both the Muslims and Hindus from across the border continue the tradition.

It is fundamentally performative poetry and its recital, sometimes impromptu, is held in Mushairas (poetic expositions). Although its tarannum saaz (singing aspect) has undergone major changes in recent decades, its popularity among the masses remains unaltered. Mushairas are today held in metropolitan areas worldwide because of the cultural influence of the South Asian diaspora. Ghazal singing and Qawwali are also important expository forms of Urdu poetry.

==Forms==
The principal forms of Urdu poetry are:
*Ghazal (غزل): a set of two liner couplets, which strictly should end with the same rhyme and should be within one of the predefined meters of ghazals. There has to be a minimum of five couplets to form a ghazal. Couplets may or may not have the same thought. It is one of the most difficult forms of poetry as there are many strict parameters that one needs to abide by while writing ghazal. It is important to think about the topic as well as the theme of a ghazal before starting to write it. The first line of a ghazal must include a refrain, which is a word or a phrase that can be easily fitted into the other couplets. Each couplet of a ghazal is known as Sher (شعر ). The first Sher is called Matla&#x27; (مطلع ). The last Sher is called Maqta&#x27; (مقطع ), but only if the poet uses his &quot;Takhalus (تخلص )&quot;.
*Hamd (حمّد): a poem in praise of God. The word &quot;hamd&quot; is derived from the Qur&#x27;an, its English translation is &quot;Praise&quot;.
*Manqabat (منقبت): a Sufi devotional poem, in praise of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the son-in-law of Muhammad, or of any Sufi saint.
*Marsiya (مرثیہ): an elegy typically composed about the death of Hasan, Husayn, their relatives, and their companions. Each stanza has six lines, with the rhyme scheme AAAABB. The famous marsia writers who inherited the tradition of Mir Anis among his successive generations are Mir Nawab Ali &#x27;Munis&#x27;, Dulaha Sahab &#x27;Uruj&#x27;, Syed Mohammed Mohsin (Jaunpuri), Mustafa Meerza urf Piyare Sahab &#x27;Rasheed&#x27;, Syed Muhammad Mirza Uns, Ali Nawab &#x27;Qadeem&#x27;, Syed Sajjad Hussain &quot;Shadeed&quot; Lucknavi, Allama, Dr.Syed Ali Imam Zaidi, &quot;Gauher&quot; Luckhnavi the great-grandson of Mir Babber Ali Anis, Syed Karrar Hyder (Jaunpuri) and Syed Yadullah Haider (son of Syed Karrar Hyder).
*Masnavi (مثنوی): a poem written in couplets in bacchic tetrameter with an iambus for last foot. The topic is often romance. Mir Taqi Mir and Sauda wrote some of this kind. The Religious Masnavi History of Islam (Tarikh-e-Islam Az Quran) written by Dr Syed Ali Imam Zaidi Gauher Lucknavi.
*Na`at (نعت): poetry that specifically praises the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
*Nazm (نظم): the basic type of Urdu poetry. It can be written on any topic, and so a wide host of Nazm exist. From Nazeer Akbarabadi, Iqbal, Josh, Firaq, Akhtarul Iman to down the line Noon Meem Rashid, Faiz, Ali Sardar Jafri and Kaifi Azmi, Urdu poets have covered common life, philosophical thinking, national issues and the precarious predicament of an individual human being. As a distinct form of Nazm many Urdu poets influenced by English and other European poets took to writing sonnets in the Urdu language. Azmatullah Khan (1887–1923) is believed to have introduced this format to Urdu Literature. The other renowned Urdu poets who wrote sonnets were Akhtar Junagarhi, Akhtar Sheerani, Noon Meem Rashid, Zia Fatehabadi, Salaam Machhalishahari and Wazir Agha.
*Qasida (قصیدہ): usually an ode to a benefactor, a satire, or an account of an event. It uses the same rhyme system as the ghazal, but is usually longer.
*Ruba&#x27;i (رُباعی): a poetry style, the Arabic term for &quot;quatrain&quot;. The plural form of the word, &quot;rubāʿiyāt&quot;, often anglicised &quot;rubaiyat&quot;, is used to describe a collection of such quatrains.
*Tazkira (تذکرہ): a biographical anthology of poetry.

===Collection forms===

==Pen names==

In the Urdu poetic tradition, most poets use a pen name called the &quot;Takhallus&quot; (تخلص). This can be either a part of a poet&#x27;s given name or something else adopted as an identity. The traditional convention in identifying Urdu poets is to mention the takhallus at the end of the name.
The word &quot;takhallus&quot; is derived from Arabic, meaning &quot;ending&quot;. This is because in the Ghazal form, the poet would usually incorporate his or her pen name into the final couplet () of each poem.

==Scripts used in poetry==
In Pakistan and Deccan region of India, Urdu poetry is written in the standard Nasta&#x27;liq calligraphy style of the Perso-Arabic script. However, in north India, where Urdu poetry is very popular, the Perso-Arabic is often found transliterated into the Devanāgarī script, as an aid for those Hindī-speakers, who can comprehend Urdu, but cannot read the Perso-Arabic script. With the dawn of the internet and globalization, this poetry is often found written in Roman Urdu as well as in Hindi script.

===Example of Urdu ghazal===
The following is a verse from an Urdu ghazal by Syed Khwaja Mir Dard:

Urdu:
:

Roman Urdu:
:&quot;Dōstō, dēkhā tamāśhā yaāhan kā bas.&quot;
:&quot;Tum raho; ab hum tō apne ghar chalē&quot;

English translation:
:Friends, I&#x27;ve seen the spectacle of this place enough
:You stay here; I&#x27;m heading home.

Note Dard&#x27;s use of the royal &quot;we&quot; in this couplet, a technique characteristic of formal Urdu poetry.

<text>KF (, &quot;Co-operative Union&quot;) is a federation of consumer co-operatives in Sweden and a retail group, with groceries as its core business.

== History ==
KF was founded in 1899 by 41 local consumer co-operatives in order to support them with information and education of store managers and board members. Soon KF also became responsible for common procurement of goods. In the 1930s, KF expanded rapidly during the management of Albin Johansson, setting up various industries in order to support the co-operative grocery stores. From 1950 to 1970, KF was at the forefront of the Swedish retail trade by developing new and bigger store formats and it was one of the major business groups in Scandinavia. In the beginning of the 1990s, as a response to a financial crisis, KF decided to sell out all its industries and focus on retail trade only. Around the year 2000, KF formed the retail chain Coop Norden along with its Nordic co-operative counterparts, Danish FDB and Norwegian Coop NKL. In 2002, KF bought a 50% share in BOL Sweden from Bertelsmann. Due to poor financial results in Coop Norden the owners decided to renationalize the operation of the stores in 2007. In July 2021, Coop was temporarily shut down by a ransomware attack on Kaseya software services.

== Today ==
As of 2012, KF is a federation of 39 consumer co-operatives with more than 3.2 million members and a retail group with a net worth (ex. VAT) of SEK 37.3 billion. The grocery retail group, , stands for around 85 per cent of the sale with store brands like Coop Konsum, Coop Nära, Coop Extra, Stora Coop and Coop Forum. KF accounts for approximately 55 percent of consumer cooperative retail sales in Sweden. The other part is run by local or regional retail cooperatives, even though procurement, logistics and store brands are integrated. Together, KF and the consumer co-operatives have a market share of 21.5 per cent of the Swedish grocery retail trade (2010).

<text>Dafydd &quot;David&quot; Rhys Williams (born May 16, 1954) is a Canadian physician, public speaker, author and retired CSA astronaut. Williams was a mission specialist on two Space Shuttle missions. His first spaceflight, STS-90 in 1998, was a 16-day mission aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; dedicated to neuroscience research. His second flight, STS-118 in August 2007, was flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; to the International Space Station. During that mission he performed three spacewalks, becoming the third Canadian to perform a spacewalk and setting a Canadian record for total number of spacewalks. These spacewalks combined for a total duration of 17 hours and 47 minutes.

In 1998, Williams became the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA, when he held the position of Director of the Space and Life Sciences Directorate at the Johnson Space Center and Deputy Associate Administrator of the Office of Spaceflight at NASA Headquarters.

==Education==
Williams earned a Bachelor of Science in biology from McGill University in 1976, a Master of Science in physiology, and a Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery from McGill University in 1983. He completed a residency in family medicine at the University of Ottawa in 1985 and obtained fellowship in emergency medicine from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, following completion of a residency in emergency medicine at the University of Toronto in 1988.

==Medical career==
Williams received postgraduate training in advanced invertebrate physiology at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington. Subsequently, his interests switched to vertebrate neurophysiology when, for his master&#x27;s thesis, he became involved in basic science research on the role of adrenal steroid hormones in modifying the activity of regions within the central nervous system involved in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. While working in the Neurophysiological Laboratories at the Allan Memorial Institute for Psychiatry, he assisted in clinical studies of slow wave potentials within the central nervous system.

His clinical research in emergency medicine has included studies evaluating the initial training and skill retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills, patient survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the early identification of trauma patients at high risk, and the efficacy of tetanus immunization in the elderly.

In 1988, he became an emergency physician with the department of emergency services at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre as well as a lecturer with the Department of Surgery at the University of Toronto. He served as a member of the Air Ambulance Utilization Committee with the Ontario Ministry of Health both as an academic emergency physician and later as a representative of community emergency physicians. In addition, he has trained ambulance attendants, paramedics, nurses, residents, and practicing physicians in cardiac and trauma resuscitation as a course director in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) with the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation and in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) with the American College of Surgeons.

From 1989 to 1990, he served as an emergency physician with the Emergency Associates of Kitchener-Waterloo and as medical director of the Westmount Urgent Care Clinic. In 1990, he returned to Sunnybrook as medical director of the ACLS program and coordinator of postgraduate training in emergency medicine. Subsequently, he became the Director of the Department of Emergency Services at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Assistant Professor of Surgery, University of Toronto, and assistant professor of medicine, University of Toronto.
He remains active in life science and space medicine research, both as a Principal Investigator and as a Co-Investigator.

In April 2008, Williams was recruited by McMaster University as a physician-scientist where he was the director for the new McMaster Centre for Medical Robotics at St. Joseph&#x27;s Healthcare Hamilton.

On May 18, 2011, Williams became the new president and CEO of Southlake Regional Health Centre, the regional hospital in Newmarket, Ontario, to lead the facility into becoming a full-fledged teaching and research centre. He continued in this role until October 2017 when he left Southlake to work as a healthcare and aerospace consultant.

==Astronaut career==
Williams was selected by the Canadian Space Agency in June 1992. He completed basic training, and in May 1993 was appointed manager of the Missions and Space Medicine Group within the astronaut program. His collateral duty assignments have included supervising the implementation of operational space medicine activities within the astronaut program and the coordination of the Canadian Astronaut Program Space Unit Life Simulation (CAPSULS) Project. In February 1994 he participated in a 7-day space mission simulation. During this CAPSULS Project he was the Principal Investigator of a study to evaluate the initial training and retention of resuscitation skills by non-medical astronauts. He was also assigned as one of the crew members and acted as the crew medical officer. He announced his retirement as an astronaut on February 29, 2008, effective from March 1, 2008.

===NASA experience===
In January 1995, Williams was selected to join the 1995 international class of NASA mission specialist astronaut candidates. He reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 and completed training and evaluation in May 1996. On completing basic training, he was assigned to work technical issues for the payloads/habitability branch of the astronaut office.

From July 1998 to November 2002, Williams served as Director of the Space and Life Sciences directorate with responsibility for research in both physical and biomedical space sciences at the Johnson Space Center (JSC). With this appointment, he became the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA.

Overall crew medical safety was one of his principal concerns, in addition to flight medical operations and JSC occupational and environmental health. His programs were directed toward protecting astronauts from the hazards of the space environment, including space radiation and microgravity, in addition to maintaining their medical, physical, and psychological well-being while aloft and on return to Earth. His other oversight responsibilities were in the fields of telemedicine, 3-D tissue culture/regeneration in microgravity, the curatorial management of extraterrestrial materials, and of qualifying humans for very long space journeys and ensuring their safe return to Earth.

Williams served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. During this mission, he was thrilled to shake hands underwater with Canadian underwater explorer Joe MacInnis. Williams was originally scheduled to command NEEMO 7 in October 2004, but was replaced by back-up crewmember and fellow CSA astronaut Robert Thirsk due to Williams undergoing review of a temporary medical issue. In April 2006, Williams commanded the NEEMO 9 mission. During this eighteen-day mission, the six-person crew developed lunar surface exploration procedures and telemedical technology applications.

===STS-90===
Williams was on a mission specialist 3 on STS-90 Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998). During the 16-day Spacelab flight, the seven-person crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged Williams over 381 hours in space.

===STS-118===
Williams was assigned to the crew of STS-118 (August 8 to 21, 2007), an assembly mission to the International Space Station. He completed three spacewalks during this mission, and set two new records during his final EVA on Saturday, August 18: he is the Canadian with the most spacewalks (3) and Williams ended Saturday&#x27;s EVA with a total duration of 17 hours, 47 minutes of extravehicular time. He was the second Canadian to lead an EVA and is one of four Canadian astronauts who have performed EVAs. 

==Awards and honours ==
Williams is a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, the Ontario Medical Association, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, the Aerospace Medical Association, the Canadian Society for Aerospace Medicine, and the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute. Past affiliations include the Society for Neuroscience, the New York Academy of Science, and the Montreal Physiological Society.

Williams was awarded the Commonwealth Certificate of Thanks in 1973 and the Commonwealth Recognition Award (1975) for his contribution to the Royal Life Saving Society of Canada. Academic awards include the A.S. Hill Bursary, McGill University, in 1980; the Walter Hoare Bursary, McGill University, in 1981; and the J.W. McConnell Award, McGill University, from 1981 to 1983.

<text>John of Austria (, ; 24 February 1547 – 1 October 1578) was the illegitimate son of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V recognized him in a codicil to his will. John became a military leader in the service of his half-brother, King Philip II of Spain, Charles V&#x27;s heir, and was addressed to as a Don. He is best known for his role as the admiral of the Holy League fleet at the Battle of Lepanto and as Governor of the Spanish Netherlands.

==Life==
===Early years===
John of Austria was born in Regensburg, Upper Palatinate. His mother was Barbara Blomberg, the daughter of a burgher, and his father was Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who had been widowed since 1539.

In the summer of 1554, he was taken to the castle of Luis de Quijada in Villagarcía de Campos, Valladolid. Magdalena de Ulloa, de Quijada&#x27;s wife, took charge of his education, assisted by Latin teacher Guillén Prieto, chaplain García de Morales, and Juan Galarza, a squire. 

Charles V wrote a codicil, dated 6 June 1554, in which he recognized: &quot;For since I was in Germany, after being widowed, I had a natural child of one unmarried woman, named Geronimo&quot;. In the summer of 1558, Charles ordered de Quijada, de Ulloa, and John to relocate to the village of Cuacos de Yuste. Charles resided nearby at the Monastery of Yuste, and until his own death in September of that year, he saw his son several times. In his last will of 1558, he officially recognized John as his son; he also arranged for John to enter the clergy and pursue an ecclesiastical career.

Charles&#x27;s only surviving legitimate son and heir, Philip II of Spain, was then outside of Spain. Rumors had spread about John&#x27;s paternity, which de Quijada denied, and he wrote to Charles asking for instructions. Charles replied with a note written by his personal secretary Eraso, in which he recommended to wait for Philip&#x27;s return to Spain. Joanna, Dowager Princess of Portugal and regent during the absence of her brother Philip, asked to see the child. She met him in Valladolid in May 1559, coinciding with an &quot;auto-da-fé&quot; then taking place.

Philip II returned from Brussels in 1559, aware of his father&#x27;s will. Once he had settled in Valladolid, he summoned de Quijada to bring John to a hunt. The first meeting between Philip and John took place on 28 September in the Monastery of Santa María de La Santa Espina. When the king appeared, de Quijada told John to dismount as a sign of respect. When John did so, Philip asked him if he knew the identity of his father; he did not, so Philip explained that they had the same father and thus were brothers. Philip insisted that, although John was a member of the House of Habsburg, he was not to be addressed as &quot;Your Highness&quot;, the form reserved for royals and sovereign princes. 

John was known as &quot;Don Juan de Austria&quot;, and his manner of address was &quot;Your Excellency&quot;, the title used for a Spanish grandee. He did not live in a palace, but maintained a separate household with de Quijada as the head. Philip allowed John to have the income allocated to him by Charles. In public ceremonies, John stood, walked, or rode ahead of the grandees, but behind the royal family.

===Formative years===

John completed his education at the University of Alcalá de Henares (now the Complutense University of Madrid), where he attended with his two nephews: Prince Carlos, son and heir of Philip II, and Alessandro Farnese, the son of Charles V&#x27;s other acknowledged illegitimate child, Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Parma. All three were taught by Honorato Hugo, the disciple of scholar Juan Luis Vives. While at the university, Carlos sustained a skull fracture, resulting in personality changes.

In 1562, the royal house assigned John 15,000 ducats, the same amount allocated to his half-sister Joanna, Dowager Princess of Portugal, with whom John had a close relationship.

In 1565, Farnese left Alcalá de Henares to reside in Brussels, where his mother governed the Spanish Netherlands. He married Maria of Portugal while in Brussels.

John actively participated in court ceremonies, including at the baptisms of his nieces, Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catherine Michaela. He was assigned to carry the infants to the baptismal font.

In 1565, the Ottoman Empire attacked Malta. To defend the island, a fleet was gathered at the port of Barcelona. John asked Philip for permission to join the navy, but was denied; he then left the court and travelled to Barcelona, but was unable to reach the fleet in time. John continued his attempts to join the fleet of García Álvarez de Toledo y Osorio until a letter from Philip caused him to give up.

Prince Carlos confided in John and told him of his plans to flee Spain and travel towards the Spanish Netherlands from Italy. He needed John&#x27;s help to acquire a galley that would ferry him to Italy. In exchange for his assistance, the prince promised John control of the Kingdom of Naples. John said that he would give Carlos an answer, and went to El Escorial to report him to the king.

John returned to the Mediterranean to take charge of the fleet. After meeting with his advisers in Cartagena on 2 June 1568, he went out to sea to fight the corsairs for a period of three months. He sailed to North Africa, landing at Oran and Melilla.

===Rebellion of the Alpujarras===
A decree dated 1 January 1567 forced the Moriscos who lived in the Kingdom of Granada, particularly in the Alpujarras region, to abandon their customs, language, clothing, and religious practices. By the end of 1568, almost 200 towns revolted against the decree.

Philip deposed Iñigo López de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Mondejar, and appointed John the supreme commander of the royal forces. He chose Luis de Requesens to serve as one of John&#x27;s advisers. 

On 13 April 1569 John arrived in Granada, where he built his forces. Luis de Requesens and Álvaro de Bazán patrolled the coast with their galleys, limiting aid and reinforcements from Barbary.

The deportation policy aggravated the situation. John asked Philip for permission to go on the offensive. The king granted his request and John left Granada at the head of a large and well-supplied army. After clearing rebels from nearby Granada, he marched east through Guadix, where veteran troops from Italy joined him, increasing his number of troops to 12,000. 

At the end of 1569 he managed to pacify Güéjar, and in late January 1570 he laid siege to the stronghold of Galera. The siege of Galera stalled, so John ordered a general assault, making use of artillery and strategically set mines. On 10 February 1570, he entered the village, and had it levelled to the ground with salt ploughed into its soil. Between 400 and 4,500 inhabitants were killed, and 2,000–4,500 more were sold into slavery.

When he marched on the fortress of Serón, John was shot in the head, and his foster father Luis de Quijada was wounded. De Quijada died of his injuries a week later, on 25 February, in Caniles. John took the town of Terque, which dominated the middle valley of the Almería River.

In May 1570, John negotiated a peace with El Habaquí. In the summer and fall of 1570, the last campaigns to subdue the rebels were carried out. In February 1571, Philip signed a decree expelling all Moriscos from the Kingdom of Granada. John&#x27;s letters described their forced exile as the greatest &quot;human misery&quot; that can be portrayed.

===The War of Cyprus and Battle of Lepanto===
The War of Cyprus became the focus of Spanish attention after Pope Pius V sent an envoy to urge Philip to join him and Venice in a Holy League against the Turks. Philip II agreed, and negotiations opened in Rome. Among Philip&#x27;s terms was the appointment of John as commander-in-chief of the Holy League armada. He agreed that Cyprus should be protected, but also wished to recover control of Tunis, where the Turks had overthrown Philip&#x27;s Muslim client ruler. Tunis posed an immediate threat to Sicily, one of Philip&#x27;s kingdoms. He also had in mind the eventual conquest of Algiers, whose corsairs posed a constant nuisance to Spain. Charles V had tried and failed to take it in 1541.

While John finished the pacification of Granada, negotiations continued in Rome. In the summer of 1570, Philip sailed for Cyprus under the pope&#x27;s admiral Marcantonio Colonna. In charge of Philip&#x27;s contingent was the Genoese Gian Andrea Doria, a great-nephew of Andrea Doria. On reaching the Turkish coast in September, Colonna and the Venetians wished to continue towards Cyprus while Doria argued that it was too late. Then, news arrived that Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, had fallen, and only the port of Famagusta remained. Sickness hit the Venetian fleet and a consensus grew that it was best to return to port, which they did. Animosities between the Christian allies became more open while the Turks continued their siege of Famagusta.

The Venetians repaired their galley fleet and readied six armed galleasses. The pope hired twelve galleys from the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The dukes of Savoy and Parma also provided galleys, and Alexander Farnese sailed in one of them. When the League was formally signed in May, John was designated commander-in-chief and given instructions by Philip. He travelled with the Spanish squadron from Barcelona in July, and the Holy League armada set sail from Messina in mid-September.

John found the Turkish fleet at Lepanto in the Gulf of Corinth. After some debate amongst themselves, The Turks chose to fight. They had the larger fleet, nearly 300 vessels to John&#x27;s 207 galleys and six galleasses. 

On 7 October 1571, the Turkish fleet emerged into the Gulf of Patras and took battle formation. Bringing his fleet through the Curzolaris islets, John deployed his armada into a left wing under Venetian command, a right wing under Doria, a center under himself, and a rear guard under the Marquis of Santa Cruz. In all four formations were galleys from each of the participating states. Two galleasses each were assigned to the wings and center. The battle began around noon.

The gunfire from the galleasses disrupted the Turkish formations as they pressed to the attack, and the bigger and more numerous guns of the Christian allies did damage as the Turkish right and center closed to board. The allies won the fighting on the decks. Among the wounded was 24-year-old Miguel de Cervantes, future writer of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Cervantes later wrote a description of the courage of the Christian combatants.

The Turkish left wing under Uluj Ali, the governor general of Algiers, tried to outmaneuver Doria&#x27;s wing, drawing it away from the League center. When a gap appeared between Doria and the center, Uluj Ali turned and aimed at the gap, smashing three galleys of the Knights of Malta on John&#x27;s right flank. John came around while the Marquis of Santa Cruz hit Uluj Ali with his rear guard. Uluj Ali and approximately half of his wing escaped. 

At the end of the battle, the Turkish fleet was destroyed and thousands of Turkish soldiers were killed. The League had over 13,000 casualties and liberated over 10,000 Christian slaves. In the evening, a storm broke and the League had to head for port, while sporadic Greek uprisings were suppressed by the Turks. 

During and after the battle of Lepanto, John was addressed in letters and in person with &quot;Highness&quot; and &quot;Prince&quot;, in contradiction to the initial protocol and address by Philip. There are no records to indicate if Philip gave Don John these honors.

===The Low Countries===
When Luis de Requesens died on 5 March 1576, the Council of State urged the king to appoint a new governor immediately, recommending that it be a member of the royal family. Philip appointed John as governor-general; John entered Brussels on 1 May 1577.

John captured the city of Namur on 24 July 1577. In January 1578 he defeated the Protestants in the Battle of Gembloux. The defeat at Gembloux forced Prince William of Orange, the leader of the revolt, to leave Brussels. The victory of John also meant the end of the Union of Brussels, and hastened the disintegration of the unity of the rebel provinces. Six months later John was defeated at Rijmenam.

===Death===
Two months after his defeat at Rijmenam, John of Austria contracted a fever and died on 1 October 1578, at the age of 31. To avoid his body being captured at sea by Spain&#x27;s enemies, it was returned to Madrid overland in four saddle bags and reassembled once there. John was buried in the Escorial, the only illegitimate Habsburg to be so honored.
== Coat of arms ==
As John of Austria was the illegitimate son of Charles V, the partitions of the armories of his father&#x27;s coat of arms were modified for his own. John&#x27;s coat of arms consisted of a divided shield; on the dexter (left) side, the arms of Castile and León were placed in a cut and not quartered (repeated in four quarters), as usual; on the sinister (right) side were Aragon and Aragon-Sicily; and on the divided inescutcheon (center) were Austria and Duchy of Burgundy.

The coat of arms of John of Austria did not incorporate the blazons of Granada, Franche-Comté, Brabant, Flanders, and Tyrol that appeared in the coat of arms of his father. Encircling the shield is the necklace of the Order of the Golden Fleece.

==Legacy==

A monument to John of Austria was erected in Messina at the initiative of the local senate in 1572, to honor the victor of Lepanto. The statue survived the devastating 1908 earthquake; however, it was moved to another location in the city.

A copy of the statue of John in Messina was erected in his birthplace of Regensburg in 1978, the fourth centenary of his death.

===In literature===
*A &quot;Don John&quot; is a villain in William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1599 play &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. He is listed in the &quot;dramatis personae&quot; as &quot;illegitimate brother to Don Pedro&quot;, Prince of Aragon. 
*Don John of Austria&#x27;s life inspired the 1835 play &quot;Don Juan d&#x27;Autriche&quot; by Casimir Delavigne, which served in turn as a source for two operas, &quot;Don John of Austria&quot; by Isaac Nathan in 1847 and &quot;Don Giovanni d&#x27;Austria&quot; by Filippo Marchetti in 1879.
*G. K. Chesterton in 1911 published a poem, &quot;Lepanto&quot;, in which he dubbed Don John &quot;the last knight of Europe&quot;.
*The historical novel &quot;A Knight of Spain&quot; (1913) by Marjorie Bowen depicts the relationship between Don John of Austria and his half-brother, Philip.
*The historical romance, &quot;Spanish Lover&quot;, by Frank H. Spearman (Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, 1930), has Don John as its central character.
*In 1956, Louis de Wohl published &quot;The Last Crusader: A Novel about Don Juan of Austria&quot;, presenting Don John of Austria as one of history&#x27;s most triumphant and inspiring heroes.
*The 1990 historical novel &quot;La visita en el tiempo&quot; by Venezuelan writer Arturo Uslar Pietri depicts Don Juan searching for his own identity, his journey from an orphaned childhood to his transformation into the (illegitimate) son of Emperor Charles V and the hero of Lepanto. The novel won the 1991 Rómulo Gallegos Prize novel prize.

<doc id="514091" wikidata="Q2472049" url="?curid=514091" title="Lists of World War II flying aces">
<text>Fighter aces in World War II had tremendously varying kill scores, affected as they were by many factors: the pilot&#x27;s skill level, the performance of the airplane the pilot flew and the planes they flew against, how long they served, their opportunity to meet the enemy in the air (Allied to Axis disproportion), whether they were the formation&#x27;s leader or a wingman, the standards their air service brought to the awarding of victory credits, et cetera.

Towards the end of the war, the Axis powers had largely exhausted their supply of skilled pilots and the replacements did not have as much opportunity to gain enough experience to be successful. Additionally, national policies differed; German, Italian, and Japanese pilots tended to return to the cockpit over and over again until they were killed.

It is not clear what impact each nation&#x27;s rules for score crediting have on the counts listed below. Germans credited a shared victory to only one pilot, while the French credited full victory to all participants. British, Finnish and US air forces credited fractional shares of aerial victories, resulting in fractions, such as 11½, which might be for example 10 aircraft and three shares with the second pilot. Some U.S. commands also credited aircraft destroyed on the ground. The Soviets counted only solo kills, while group kills were counted separately, as did the Japanese. The Italian Air Force did not officially credit victories to individual pilots, but to their unit as a whole. Probable kills are usually left out of the list.

It is necessary to emphasize that the question of assessing and comparing the success rate of fighters by number of victories is one of the more problematic. There are disputes about what is &quot;shot down&quot; and what is &quot;air victory&quot;, but the most problematic seems to be credibility of reports and reliability of its confirmation, which was substantially different in particular air forces. The most reliable is considered the confirmation of the victories in RAF, which based its counts on comparison of testimonials of participants andif possiblefilm material.

<text>Lithium aluminium hydride, commonly abbreviated to LAH, is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula or . It is a white solid, discovered by Finholt, Bond and Schlesinger in 1947. This compound is used as a reducing agent in organic synthesis, especially for the reduction of esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. The solid is dangerously reactive toward water, releasing gaseous hydrogen (H2). Some related derivatives have been discussed for hydrogen storage.

== Properties, structure, preparation ==

LAH is a colourless solid but commercial samples are usually gray due to contamination. This material can be purified by recrystallization from diethyl ether. Large-scale purifications employ a Soxhlet extractor. Commonly, the impure gray material is used in synthesis, since the impurities are innocuous and can be easily separated from the organic products. The pure powdered material is pyrophoric, but not its large crystals. Some commercial materials contain mineral oil to inhibit reactions with atmospheric moisture, but more commonly it is packed in moisture-proof plastic sacks.

LAH violently reacts with water, including atmospheric moisture, to liberate hydrogen gas. The reaction proceeds according to the following idealized equation:

This reaction provides a useful method to generate hydrogen in the laboratory. Aged, air-exposed samples often appear white because they have absorbed enough moisture to generate a mixture of the white compounds lithium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide.

=== Structure ===

LAH crystallizes in the monoclinic space group &quot;P&quot;21/&quot;c&quot;. The unit cell has the dimensions: &quot;a&quot; = 4.82, &quot;b&quot; = 7.81, and &quot;c&quot; = 7.92 Å, α = γ = 90° and β = 112°. In the structure, cations are surrounded by five anions, which have tetrahedral molecular geometry. The cations are bonded to one hydrogen atom from each of the surrounding tetrahedral anion creating a bipyramid arrangement. At high pressures (&gt;2.2 GPa) a phase transition may occur to give β-LAH.
=== Preparation ===
 was first prepared from the reaction between lithium hydride (LiH) and aluminium chloride:

In addition to this method, the industrial synthesis entails the initial preparation of sodium aluminium hydride from the elements under high pressure and temperature:

 is then prepared by a salt metathesis reaction according to:

which proceeds in a high yield. LiCl is removed by filtration from an ethereal solution of LAH, with subsequent precipitation of LAH to yield a product containing around 1% &quot;w&quot;/&quot;w&quot; LiCl.

An alternative preparation starts from LiH, and metallic Al instead of . Catalyzed by a small quantity of (0.2%), the reaction proceeds well using dimethylether as solvent. This method avoids the cogeneration of salt.

=== Solubility data ===

LAH is soluble in many ethereal solutions. However, it may spontaneously decompose due to the presence of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Thus, THF is preferred over, e.g., diethyl ether, despite the lower solubility.

=== Thermal decomposition ===
LAH is metastable at room temperature. During prolonged storage it slowly decomposes to (lithium hexahydridoaluminate) and LiH. This process can be accelerated by the presence of catalytic elements, such as titanium, iron or vanadium.

When heated LAH decomposes in a three-step reaction mechanism:


 is usually initiated by the melting of LAH in the temperature range 150–170 °C, immediately followed by decomposition into solid , although is known to proceed below the melting point of as well. At about 200 °C, decomposes into LiH () and Al which subsequently convert into LiAl above 400 °C (). Reaction R1 is effectively irreversible. is reversible with an equilibrium pressure of about 0.25 bar at 500 °C. and can occur at room temperature with suitable catalysts.

=== Thermodynamic data ===
The table summarizes thermodynamic data for LAH and reactions involving LAH, in the form of standard enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy change, respectively.

== Applications ==

=== Use in organic chemistry ===
Lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) is widely used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. It is more powerful than the related reagent sodium borohydride owing to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. Often as a solution in diethyl ether and followed by an acid workup, it will convert esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, aldehydes, and ketones into the corresponding alcohols (see: carbonyl reduction). Similarly, it converts amide, nitro, nitrile, imine, oxime, and organic azides into the amines (see: amide reduction). It reduces quaternary ammonium cations into the corresponding tertiary amines. Reactivity can be tuned by replacing hydride groups by alkoxy groups. Due to its pyrophoric nature, instability, toxicity, low shelf life and handling problems associated with its reactivity, it has been replaced in the last decade, both at the small-industrial scale and for large-scale reductions by the more convenient related reagent sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, which exhibits similar reactivity but with higher safety, easier handling and better economics.

LAH is most commonly used for the reduction of esters and carboxylic acids to primary alcohols; prior to the advent of LAH this was a difficult conversion involving sodium metal in boiling ethanol (the Bouveault-Blanc reduction). Aldehydes and ketones can also be reduced to alcohols by LAH, but this is usually done using milder reagents such as ; α, β-unsaturated ketones are reduced to allylic alcohols. When epoxides are reduced using LAH, the reagent attacks the less hindered end of the epoxide, usually producing a secondary or tertiary alcohol. Epoxycyclohexanes are reduced to give axial alcohols preferentially.

Partial reduction of acid chlorides to give the corresponding aldehyde product cannot proceed via LAH, since the latter reduces all the way to the primary alcohol. Instead, the milder lithium tri-&quot;tert&quot;-butoxyaluminum hydride, which reacts significantly faster with the acid chloride than with the aldehyde, must be used. For example, when isovaleric acid is treated with thionyl chloride to give isovaleroyl chloride, it can then be reduced via lithium tri-&quot;tert&quot;-butoxyaluminum hydride to give isovaleraldehyde in 65% yield.

Lithium aluminium hydride also reduces alkyl halides to alkanes. Alkyl iodides react the fastest, followed by alkyl bromides and then alkyl chlorides. Primary halides are the most reactive followed by secondary halides. Tertiary halides react only in certain cases.

Lithium aluminium hydride does not reduce simple alkenes or arenes. Alkynes are reduced only if an alcohol group is nearby, and alkenes are reduced in the presence of catalytic TiCl4. It was observed that the reduces the double bond in the &quot;N&quot;-allylamides.

=== Inorganic chemistry ===
LAH is widely used to prepare main group and transition metal hydrides from the corresponding metal halides.

LAH also reacts with many inorganic ligands to form coordinated alumina complexes associated with lithium ions.

:LiAlH4 + 4NH3 → Li[Al(NH2)4] + 4H2

=== Hydrogen storage ===

LiAlH4 contains 10.6 wt% hydrogen, thereby making LAH a potential hydrogen storage medium for future fuel cell-powered vehicles. The high hydrogen content, as well as the discovery of reversible hydrogen storage in Ti-doped NaAlH4, have sparked renewed research into LiAlH4 during the last decade. A substantial research effort has been devoted to accelerating the decomposition kinetics by catalytic doping and by ball milling.
In order to take advantage of the total hydrogen capacity, the intermediate compound LiH must be dehydrogenated as well. Due to its high thermodynamic stability this requires temperatures in excess of 400 °C, which is not considered feasible for transportation purposes. Accepting LiH + Al as the final product, the hydrogen storage capacity is reduced to 7.96 wt%. Another problem related to hydrogen storage is the recycling back to LiAlH4 which, owing to its relatively low stability, requires an extremely high hydrogen pressure in excess of 10000 bar. Cycling only reaction R2 — that is, using Li3AlH6 as starting material — would store 5.6 wt% hydrogen in a single step (vs. two steps for NaAlH4 which stores about the same amount of hydrogen). However, attempts at this process have not been successful so far.

=== Other tetrahydridoaluminiumates ===
A variety of salts analogous to LAH are known. NaH can be used to efficiently produce sodium aluminium hydride (NaAlH4) by metathesis in THF:
:LiAlH4 + NaH → NaAlH4 + LiH
Potassium aluminium hydride (KAlH4) can be produced similarly in diglyme as a solvent:
:LiAlH4 + KH → KAlH4 + LiH

The reverse, i.e., production of LAH from either sodium aluminium hydride or potassium aluminium hydride can be achieved by reaction with LiCl or lithium hydride in diethyl ether or THF:
:NaAlH4 + LiCl → LiAlH4 + NaCl
:KAlH4 + LiCl → LiAlH4 + KCl

&quot;Magnesium alanate&quot; (Mg(AlH4)2) arises similarly using MgBr2:
:2 LiAlH4 + MgBr2 → Mg(AlH4)2 + 2 LiBr

Red-Al (or SMEAH, NaAlH2(OC2H4OCH3)2) is synthesized by reacting sodium aluminum tetrahydride (NaAlH4) and 2-methoxyethanol:

<text>Kilcreggan (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Cille Chreagain&quot;) is a village on the Rosneath Peninsula in Argyll and Bute, West of Scotland.

It developed on the north shore of the Firth of Clyde at a time when Clyde steamers brought it within easy reach of Glasgow at about 25 miles (40 km) west of the centre of Glasgow by boat. Many Glasgow shipowners and merchants made their summer retreats or even permanent residences there, and this is reflected in some very grand houses along the shore. Not all have remained occupied; some were demolished and others have been converted into flats.

Its location at the end of the Rosneath peninsula, between the Gare Loch and Loch Long, makes the journey 38 miles (61 km) by road. The B833 minor road runs along the shore for the length of the village then cuts north inland just to the east of Kilcreggan pier rather than going east along the shore past Portkil Bay to Rosneath Point. About 2 miles (3 km) north of Kilcreggan the road reaches the village of Rosneath then continues north along the shores of the Gare Loch.

The majority of the houses look south across the Clyde towards the towns of Gourock and Greenock, and further down the firth towards the Isle of Arran.

Large attractive houses continue westwards from the pier towards Baron&#x27;s Point, which marks the southern entrance to Loch Long, almost to the adjoining village of Cove which looks across Cove Bay towards Blairmore, only about 2 miles (3 km) distant, but separated by the deep waters of Loch Long. To the east of the pier, houses at Portkil extend down to Portkil Bay, and the 413-foot (126 m) hill at Rosneath home farm is topped by a television mast.

A ferry subsidised by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport provides a regular service from Kilcreggan pier across the Clyde to Gourock. Until 2012, the ferry service also included crossings of the Gare Loch to Helensburgh, and was operated by Clyde Marine Services which ran the elderly until 2007 when they introduced the new for the route. After re-tendering, the contract for the Gourock to Kilcreggan route was awarded by SPT to Clydelink which bought the smaller MV &quot;Island Princess&quot; for the run and commenced services on 1 April 2012. On 24 March 2012 more than 400 people protested at the pier over fears for the future of the service. The contract was taken away from Clydelink and returned to Clyde Marine, who resumed the Gourock to Kilcreggan ferry service on 14 May 2018 with the former &quot;Seabus&quot;, now in blue livery and renamed &quot;Chieftain&quot;. CalMac are to take over the contract from 1 June 2020, leasing &quot;Chieftain&quot; from Clyde Marine.

Kilcreggan is in the historic county of Dunbartonshire. Before the local government reorganisation in 1975 it formed part of the joint police burgh of Cove and Kilcreggan. It then formed part of Dumbarton District and Strathclyde Region until the reorganisation of the 1990s. It has been part of Argyll and Bute unitary authority since then.

Craigrownie Parish Church of Scotland serves the communities of Ardpeaton, Cove and Kilcreggan.

<text>Volodymyr (, ), previously known as Volodymyr-Volynskyi () from 1944 to 2021, is a small city in Volyn Oblast, northwestern Ukraine. It serves as the administrative centre of Volodymyr Raion and the center of Volodymyr urban hromada. It is one of the oldest cities in Ukraine and the historic centre of the region of Volhynia; it served as the capital of the Principality of Volhynia and later as one of the capital cities of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Population: 

The medieval Latin name of the town &quot;Lodomeria&quot; became the namesake of the 19th century Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, of which the town itself was not a part. south from Volodymyr is Zymne, where the oldest Orthodox monastery in Volhynia is located.

==Name==
The city was named after Vladimir the Great (Volodymyr the Great), who was born in the village of Budiatychi, about 20 km from Volodymyr, and later also abbreviated &quot;Lodomeria&quot;, &quot;Ladimiri&quot;. Following the partitions of Poland and the annexation of Volhynia by the Russian Empire in 1795, it was called &quot;Volodymyr-Volynskyi&quot; (Vladimir-Volynsky) to distinguish it from Vladimir-on-Klyazma. The name was not in use between 1919 and 1939 when the city was again part of Poland. In 1944, the name Volodymyr-Volynskyi was restored.

On 1 October 2021, the city council voted to drop the regional qualifier and change the name of the city to just &quot;Volodymyr&quot;. The decision had to be ratified by Ukraine&#x27;s national parliament (Verkhovna Rada) to take effect. On 14 December 2021 parliament approved the name change (it was supported by 348 people&#x27;s deputies). The city of Vladimir in Russia opposed the name change, claiming that there can be only one city called Vladimir.

Over the centuries its residents and rulers have used various names:

== History ==
The city is one of the oldest towns in Ukraine. It was originally a stronghold founded by Vladimir the Great (Volodymyr the Great). In 988, the city became the capital of Volodymyr Principality and the seat of an Orthodox bishopric, as mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;.

In 1160, the building of the &quot;Sobor of Dormition of the Holy Mother of God&quot; was completed. By the 13th century, the city became part of Galicia–Volhynia as one of the most important trading towns in the region. After being conquered by Batu Khan in 1240, the city was under the rule of the Mongol Empire, together with other principalities in Rus&#x27;. In 1241, the Mongol army gathered near the town before the First Mongol invasion of Poland.
In the early 14th century, the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;, Theognostus, resided in the city for several years before moving to Moscow. In 1349, the Polish king, Casimir the Great, captured the city, and subsequently it became part of the Kingdom of Poland. The Polish king began building a castle, destroyed by Lithuanians after 1370, and established a Catholic bishopric in the city (known as Włodzimierz), later transferred to nearby Lutsk, which in the 15th century instead of Volodymyr became the leading city and capital of Volhynia. In 1370, it was taken by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (after 1386, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Union) and it was not until the Union of Lublin of 1569 that it returned to the Crown of Poland. In the meantime, the city was given Magdeburg town rights in 1431. In 1491 and 1500, it was invaded by Tatars. From 1566 to 1795 it was part of the Volhynian Voivodeship. It was a royal city of Poland. Most of the city&#x27;s landmarks were built at that time, including the Baroque church of St. Joachim and St. Anne, the Jesuit church, the Dominican monastery and the chapel of St. Josaphat. Włodzimierz was also a garrison town, with the 6th Polish Infantry Regiment stationed there in 1790, and the 2nd Polish National Cavalry Brigade stationed there in 1794.

On 17 July 1792, the Battle of Włodzimierz took place in the vicinity of the town: a numerically inferior Polish force led by Tadeusz Kościuszko defeated a Russian army. The city remained a part of Poland until the Third Partition of Poland of 1795 when the Russian Empire annexed it. That year the Russian authorities changed the name of several cities in Volhynia, including Zviahel, which became Novohrad-Volynskyi. Volodymyr-Volynskyi stayed within the Russian Partition until 1917. In the 19th century, as part of anti-Polish repressions, the Russians demolished the Dominican church and Capuchin monastery, and the former Jesuit and then Basilian church was converted into an Orthodox church.

In the 18th and 19th centuries the town started to grow rapidly, mostly thanks to large numbers of Jews settling there as part of the Pale of Settlement. By the second half of the 19th century, they made up the majority of the population. According to the Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland, in the late 19th century, the city had 8,336 inhabitants, 6,122 of them Jews. In 1908, the railway station was opened.

Immediately after World War I, the area became disputed by the newly formed Second Polish Republic, Bolshevist Russia, and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, with the Polish 17th Infantry Regiment capturing it overnight on 23 January 1919. In the interbellum, the city was a seat of a powiat within the Volhynian Voivodeship of Poland and an important garrison was located there. According to the 1921 census, the population was 48.2% Jewish, 32.0% Polish, 16.8% Ukrainian, 2.6% Russian. In 1926, the Volyn Artillery Reserve Cadet School (Wołyńska Szkoła Podchorążych Rezerwy Artylerii) was established in Włodzimierz. 

===World War II===

Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and the start of World War II, the city was occupied by Soviet forces on 19 September 1939. On 23 June 1941, at the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the city was occupied by Germany and attached to the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, and immediately the Jewish community of 11,554 began to be persecuted. Between 1–3 September 1942, 25,000 Jews from the local area were shot at Piatydni. On 13 November 1942, the Germans killed another 3,000 Jews from the town near Piatydni. During World War II, a German concentration camp was located near the city. About 140 Jews returned to the city after the war but most later emigrated. By 1999, only 30 remained.

From September 1941, the Germans operated the Oflag XI-A prisoner-of-war camp in the town, which was reorganized as Stalag 365 in April 1942. In 1943, the city became a shelter for Poles escaping massacres carried out by Ukrainian nationalists of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Attacks by the UPA took place mainly in the suburbs. Poles were defended both by the Polish police established with the consent of the Germans and an illegal self-defense unit. In the city, Poles suffered from overpopulation, hunger and diseases. According to later research by Władysław Siemaszko and Ewa Siemaszko, a total of 111 Poles were killed in a dozen UPA attacks. The city was liberated by the Red Army on 20 July 1944 and annexed to the Ukrainian SSR. After the war, the vast majority of Polish residents was displaced to the post-war Polish territories, as the city was annexed from Poland by the Soviets.

===Post-war===
A Cold War air base was located north-east of the town at Zhovtnevy.

Since 1991, the city has been part of Ukraine.

===Discovery of mass graves from World War II===
A series of mass graves were discovered in 1997, with exhumations completed by 2013. Originally thought to be an example of NKVD mass murder, similar to the Katyn massacre and the Vinnytsia massacre, the Volodymyr-Volynskyi murders were shown in 2012 to have been carried out by German forces, most likely the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; C. The primary archeological evidence for German culpability was that most of the bullet shell casings were dated 1941 and were from a German factory. Testimony by a Jewish survivor of the city, Ann Kazimirski (née Ressels), who lived on Kovelska Street, recorded by the USC Shoah Foundation corroborated the view that the perpetrators were German and that the victims were primarily Jewish. Anthropological analysis of the remains led to the conclusion that three quarters of the victims were women and children. The 747 victims were reinterred in local city cemeteries.

=== Churches ===
The oldest place of worship in the town is the Temple of Volodymyr, erected several kilometres from the modern town&#x27;s centre and first mentioned in a chronicle (&quot;letopis&quot;) of 1044. The oldest existing church is the Dormition of the Mother of God built by Mstyslav Izyaslavovych in 1160. By the late 18th century it fell into disuse and finally collapsed in 1829, but was restored between 1896 and 1900. The third of the old Orthodox churches is the Eastern Orthodox Basil the Great&#x27;s cathedral, which was erected in the 14th or 15th century, though local legends attribute its construction to Volodymyr the Great, who supposedly built it some time after 992.
In 1497, Duke Alexander Jagiellon erected a Catholic church of Holy Trinity and a Dominican monastery. In 1554, another wooden Catholic church was founded by Princess Anna Zbaraska, which was later replaced by a new St. Joachim and Anna&#x27;s church in 1836. In 1755, a Jesuit church was erected there by the starost of Słonim Ignacy Sadowski and, in 1780, the Greek Catholic Josaphat&#x27;s church was added to the list. Following the Russian Empire&#x27;s takeover of the town, in the effect of the Partitions of Poland, both shrines were confiscated and donated to the authorities of the Orthodox Church, which converted them to an Orthodox monastery and church, respectively, while the Dominican monastery was converted to an administrative building.

=== Museum ===

There also exists Volodymyr Historical Museum, an architectural monument of the 19th century.

<text>A dimmer is a device connected to a light fixture and used to lower the brightness of the light. By changing the voltage waveform applied to the lamp, it is possible to lower the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, the term &quot;dimmer&quot; is generally reserved for those intended to control light output from resistive incandescent, halogen, and (more recently) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). More specialized equipment is needed to dim fluorescent, mercury-vapor, solid-state, and other arc lighting.

Dimmers range in size from small units the size of domestic light switches to high-power units used in large theatrical or architectural lighting installations. Small domestic dimmers are generally directly controlled, although remote control systems (such as X10) are available. Modern professional dimmers are generally controlled by a digital control system like DMX or DALI. In newer systems, these protocols are often used in conjunction with Ethernet.

In the professional lighting industry, changes in intensity are called &quot;fades&quot; and can be &quot;fade up&quot; or &quot;fade down&quot;. Dimmers with direct manual control had a limit on the speed they could be varied at but this problem has been largely eliminated with modern digital units (although very fast changes in brightness may still be avoided for other reasons like lamp life).

Modern dimmers are built from semiconductors instead of variable resistors, because they have higher efficiency. A variable resistor would dissipate power as heat and acts as a voltage divider. Since semiconductor or solid-state dimmers switch quickly between a low resistance &quot;on&quot; state and a high resistance &quot;off&quot; state, they dissipate very little power compared with the controlled load.

Most recently, software programmable internal dimmers can use signals from the same switch that turns lights on and off to control dimming. No dedicated external dimmer is needed. A simple communications protocol, such as Blink&#x27;n&#x27;Dim, delivers dimming commands via the power line. They enable computer control via networked switches, but do not require it. Their cost is about the same as the older &quot;dimmability&quot; circuitry that they replace in LED bulbs, fixtures or drivers. 


==History==
Early dimmers were directly controlled through the manual manipulation of large dimmer panels. This required all power to come through the lighting control location, which could be inconvenient, inefficient and potentially dangerous for large or high-powered systems, such as those used for stage lighting.

In 1896, Granville Woods patented his &quot;Safety Dimmer&quot;, which greatly reduced wasted energy by reducing the amount of energy generated to match desired demand rather than burning off unwanted energy.

In 1959, Joel S. Spira, who would found the Lutron Electronics Company in 1961, invented a dimmer based on a then-new solid state switching device called a Silicon Controlled Rectifier or SCR. This small device allowed the dimmer to be installed in a standard electrical wall box while saving energy.

In 1966, Eugene Alessio patented a light bulb socket adapter for adjusting a light level on a single light bulb using a triac. To house this device, he decided on a 2-inch round device with one end capable of being screwed into a light bulb socket and the other end able to receive a light bulb.

When solid-state dimmers came into use, analogue remote control systems (such as 0-10 V lighting control systems) became feasible. The wire for the control systems was much smaller (with low current and lower danger) than the heavy power cables of previous lighting systems. Each dimmer had its own control wires, resulting in many wires leaving the lighting control location.

More recent digital control protocols such as DMX512, DALI, or one of the many Ethernet-based protocols like Art-Net, ETCnet, sACN, Pathport, ShowNet or KiNET enable the control of a large number of dimmers (and other stage equipment) through a single cable.

==Types of dimmer==

===Rheostat dimmer===
Dimmers based on rheostats were inefficient since they would dissipate a significant portion of the power rating of the load as heat. They were large and required plenty of cooling air. Because their dimming effect depended a great deal on the total load applied to each rheostat, the load needed to be matched fairly carefully to the power rating of the rheostat. Finally, as they relied on mechanical control they were slow and it was difficult to change many channels at a time.

====Salt water dimmer====
Early examples of a rheostat dimmer include a salt water dimmer, a kind of liquid rheostat; the liquid between a movable and fixed contact provided a variable resistance. The closer the contacts to each other, the more voltage was available for the light. Salt water dimmers required regular addition of water and maintenance due to corrosion; exposed parts were energized during operation, presenting a shock hazard.

===Coil-rotation transformer===
The coil-rotation transformer used a fixed-position electromagnet coil in conjunction with a variable-position coil to vary the voltage in the line by varying the alignment of the two coils. Rotated 90 degrees apart, the secondary coil is affected by two equal but opposite fields from the primary, which effectively cancel each other out and produce no voltage in the secondary.

These coils resembled the standard rotor and stator as used in an electric motor, except that the rotor was held against rotation using brakes and was moved to specific positions using high-torque gearing. Because the rotor did not ever turn a complete revolution, a commutator was not required and long flexible cables could be used on the rotor instead.

===Autotransformer dimmer===
Variable autotransformers (trade name &quot;Variac&quot;) were then introduced. While they are still nearly as large as rheostat dimmers, which they closely resemble, they are relatively efficient devices. Their voltage output, and so their dimming effect, is largely independent of the load applied so it was far easier to design the lighting that would be attached to each autotransformer channel. Remote control of the dimmers was still impractical, although some dimmers were equipped with motor drives that could slowly and steadily reduce or increase the brightness of the attached lamps. Autotransformers have fallen out of use for lighting but are used for other applications.

However, there are certain lighting scenarios in which autotransformers are still a desirable solution (as of 2021). For instance, the control room of an audio recording studio may require an extremely strict limit for electromagnetic interference. In comparison with solid-state dimmers, the conducted emissions produced by autotransformers are effectively zero. 

===Solid-state dimmer===

Solid-state, or semiconductor, dimmers were introduced to solve some of these problems. Semiconductor dimmers switch on at an adjustable time (phase angle) after the start of each alternating-current half-cycle, thereby altering the voltage waveform applied to lamps and so changing its RMS effective value. Because they switch instead of absorbing part of the voltage supplied, there is very little wasted power. Dimming can be almost instantaneous and is easily controlled by remote electronics. This development also made it possible to make dimmers small enough to be used in place (within the pattress) of normal domestic light switches.

The switches generate some heat during switching and can also cause radio-frequency interference. Inductors or chokes are used as part of the circuitry to suppress this interference. When the dimmer is at 50% power, the switches are switching their highest voltage in Europe) and the sudden surge of power causes the coils on the inductor to move, creating a buzzing sound associated with some types of dimmer; this same effect can be heard in the filaments of the incandescent lamps as &quot;singing&quot;. The suppression circuitry might be insufficient to prevent buzzing to be heard on sensitive audio and radio equipment that shares the mains supply with the lighting loads. In this case, special steps must be taken to prevent this interference. European dimmers must comply with relevant EMC legislation requirements; this involves suppressing the emissions described above to limits described in EN55104.
In the electrical schematic shown, a typical light dimmer based on a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) dims the light through phase-angle control. This unit is wired in series with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge, which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 charges up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR fires. When the SCR conducts, D1 discharges C1 through the SCR. The SCR shuts off when the current falls to zero and the supply voltage drops at the end of the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. This circuit is called a leading-edge dimmer or forward phase dimming.

Dimmers based on insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) do away with most of the noise present in TRIACs by chopping off the falling side of the sine wave. These circuits are called trailing-edge dimmers or reverse phase dimming.

An even newer, but still expensive technology is sine-wave dimming, which is implemented as a high-power switched-mode power supply followed by a filter.

== Control ==

Non domestic dimmers are usually controlled remotely by means of various protocols. Analogue dimmers usually require a separate wire for each channel of dimming carrying a voltage between 0 and 10 V. Some analogue circuitry then derives a control signal from this and the mains supply for the switches. As more channels are added to the system more wires are needed between the lighting controller and the dimmers.

In the late 1970s, serial analogue protocols were developed. These multiplexed a series of analogue levels onto a single wire, with embedded clocking signal similar to a composite video signal (in the case of Strand Lighting&#x27;s European D54 standard, handling 384 dimmers) or separate clocking signal (in the case of the US standard AMX192).

Digital protocols, such as DMX512 have proved to be the answer since the late 1980s. In early implementations a digital signal was sent from the controller to a demultiplexer, which sat next to the dimmers. This converted the digital signal into a collection of 0 to +10 V or 0 to −10 V signals which could be connected to the individual analogue control circuits.

Modern dimmer designs use microprocessors to convert the digital signal directly into a control signal for the switches. This has many advantages, giving closer control over the dimming, and giving the opportunity for diagnostic feedback to be sent digitally back to the lighting controller.

Some dimmers in residential applications are also equipped with a radio receiver to be used as wireless light switches which can be remotely controlled by a radio transmitter.

==Patching==
Patching is the physical (&quot;hard patch&quot;) or virtual (&quot;soft patch&quot;) assignment to a circuit or channel for the purpose of control.

===Hard patch===
Dimmers are usually arranged together in racks, where they can be accessed easily, and then power is run to the instruments being controlled. In architectural installations electricity is run straight from the dimmers to the lights via permanent wiring (this is called a circuit). They are hard run and cannot be changed.

However venues such as theatres demand more flexibility. To allow for changes for each show, and occasionally during shows, theatres sometimes install circuits run permanently to sockets around the theatre. Instead of these circuits going directly to the dimmer they are connected to a &quot;patch bay&quot;. A patch bay usually sits next to the dimmers enabling the dimmers to be connected to specific circuits via a patch cable. The patch bay may also enable many circuits to be connected to one dimmer and even series connection for low-voltage lamps. Also in some theatres individual cables are run directly from the light to dimmer. The assigned connections between the circuits (either at the patch bay or in the form of individual cables) and the dimmers is known as the mains or hard patch. This is most common in older theatres, and on a tour where dimmers will be brought in by the touring company.

===Soft patch===
Most modern fixed installations do not have patch bays; instead they have a dimmer-per-circuit, and patch dimmers into channels using a computerized control console&#x27;s Soft Patch.

==Dimming curves==
The design of most analogue dimmers meant that the output of the dimmer was not directly proportional to the input. Instead, as the operator brought up a fader, the dimmer would dim slowly at first, then quickly in the middle, then slowly at the top. The shape of the curve resembled that of the third quarter of a sine wave. Different dimmers produced different dimmer curves, and different applications typically demanded different responses.

Television often uses a &quot;square law&quot; curve, providing finer control in top part of the curve, essential to allow accurate trimming of the colour temperature of lighting. Theatrical dimmers tend to use a softer &quot;S&quot; or linear curve. Digital dimmers can be made to have whatever curve the manufacturer desires; they may have a choice between a linear relationship and selection of different curves, so that they can be matched with older analogue dimmers. Sophisticated systems provide user-programmable or nonstandard curves, and a common use of a nonstandard curve is to turn a dimmer into a &quot;non-dim&quot;, switching on at a user defined control level.

== Preheat ==
Switching high-intensity incandescent (filament) lamps to full power from cold can shorten their life dramatically, owing to the large inrush current that occurs. To reduce stress on the lamp filaments, dimmers may have a preheat function. This sets a minimum level, usually between 5% and 10%, which appears turned-off, but stops the lamp from cooling down too much. This also speeds up the lamp&#x27;s reaction to sudden bursts of power that operators of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll-style shows appreciate. The opposite of this function is sometimes called top-set. This limits the maximum power supplied to a lamp, which can also extend its life.

In less advanced systems, this same effect is achieved by literally pre-heating (warming) the globes before an event or performance. This is usually achieved by slowly bringing the lights up to full (or usually 90-95%) power over a period of between 1/2 to 1 hour. This is as effective as a built-in preheat function.

==Digital==

Modern digital desks can emulate preheat and dimmer curves and allow a soft patch to be done in memory. This is often preferred as it means that the dimmer rack can be exchanged for another one without having to transfer complicated settings. Many different curves, or &quot;profiles&quot; can be programmed and used on different channels.

==Rise time==
One measure of the quality of a leading edge dimmer is the &quot;rise time&quot;. The rise time in this context is the amount of time it takes for the cut part of the waveform to get from zero to the instantaneous output voltage. In the waveform above it is a measure of the slope of the almost vertical edge of the red trace. Typically it is measured in tens to hundreds of microseconds. A longer rise time reduces the noise of the dimmer and the lamp as well as extending the life of the lamp. A longer rise time also reduces the electromagnetic interference produced by the dimmer. Unsurprisingly, a longer rise time is more expensive to implement than a short one, this is because the size of choke has to be increased. Newer dimming methods can help minimize such problems.

<text>Howard Bruce Sutter (; January 8, 1953 – October 13, 2022) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1976 and 1988. He was one of the sport&#x27;s dominant relievers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, making effective use of the split-finger fastball. A six-time All-Star and 1982 World Series champion, Sutter recorded a 2.83 career earned run average and 300 saves, the third-most in MLB history at the time of his retirement. Sutter won the National League&#x27;s (NL) Cy Young Award in 1979 as its top pitcher, and won the NL Rolaids Relief Man Award four times. He became the only pitcher to lead the NL in saves five times (1979–1982, 1984).

Born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Sutter briefly attended Old Dominion University and was subsequently signed by the Chicago Cubs as an undrafted free agent in 1971. He played five years for the Cubs, four for the St. Louis Cardinals, and three for the Atlanta Braves, serving as each team&#x27;s closer during his tenure. His usage in the eighth and ninth innings of games was partly responsible for ushering in a more specialized era for the closer role. In the mid-1980s, Sutter began to experience shoulder problems, undergoing three surgeries before retiring in 1989.

In 2006, Sutter was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was also honored by the Cardinals with the retirement of his uniform number 42 in 2006 and induction into the Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014. Sutter also served as a minor league consultant for the Philadelphia Phillies.

==Early life==
Sutter was born to Howard and Thelma Sutter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His father managed a Farm Bureau warehouse in Mount Joy, Pennsylvania. Bruce was the fifth child of six.

Sutter graduated from Donegal High School in Mount Joy, where he played baseball, football, and basketball. He was quarterback and captain of the football team and also served as captain for the basketball squad, which won a district championship in his senior season. His baseball team also won the county championship.

==Career==

===Early career===
After being selected by the Washington Senators in the 21st round of the 1970 MLB draft, Sutter instead attended Old Dominion University. He dropped out of school and returned to Lancaster to play semi-professional baseball. Ralph DiLullo, a scout for the Chicago Cubs, signed Sutter as a free agent in September 1971. He pitched in two games for the Gulf Coast League Cubs in 1972. When he was 19, Sutter had surgery on his arm to relieve a pinched nerve. When he recovered from surgery and returned to the mound a year later, Sutter found that his previous pitches were no longer effective. He learned the split-finger fastball from minor league pitching instructor Fred Martin. Sutter&#x27;s large hands helped him to use the pitch, which was a modification of the forkball.

Sutter had nearly been released by the Cubs, but found success with the new pitch. Mike Krukow, who was also a Cubs minor league player at the time, said, &quot;As soon as I saw him throw it, I knew he was going to the big leagues. Everyone wanted to throw it after he did.&quot; He recorded a 3–3 win–loss record, a 4.13 earned run average (ERA), and five saves in 40 games for the Quincy Cubs in Class A baseball in 1973.

Sutter split the 1974 season between the Class A Key West Conchs and the Class AA Midland Cubs. Though he finished the season with a combined 2–7 record, he recorded a 1.38 ERA in 65 innings. He returned to Midland in 1975 and finished the year with a 5–7 record, a 2.15 ERA, and 13 saves. Sutter led the team in ERA and saves as they won the Texas League West Division pennant. He started the 1976 season with the Class AAA Wichita Aeros, but he pitched only seven games with the team before being promoted to the major leagues.

===Chicago Cubs (1976–1980)===
Sutter joined the Cubs in May 1976. He pitched in 52 games and finished with a 6–3 win–loss record and 10 saves. In 1977 he had a 1.34 ERA, earned an All-Star Game selection, and finished sixth and seventh in NL Cy Young Award and Most Valuable Player Award voting, respectively. On September 8, 1977, Sutter struck out all three batters on nine total pitches in the ninth inning of a 10-inning 3–2 win over the Montreal Expos, becoming the 12th NL pitcher and the 19th pitcher in major-league history to achieve an immaculate inning. Sutter had also struck out the side (although not on nine pitches) upon entering the game in the eighth inning, giving him six consecutive strikeouts, tying the NL record for a reliever.

Sutter&#x27;s ERA increased to 3.19 in 1978, but he earned 27 saves. In May 1979, the Cubs acquired relief pitcher Dick Tidrow. Tidrow would enter the game and pitch a couple of innings before Sutter came in for the save. Sutter credited Tidrow for much of his success. Sutter saved 37 games for the club, tying the NL record held by Clay Carroll () and Rollie Fingers (), and won the NL Cy Young Award. This year also marked the first of five seasons (four consecutive) in which he led the league in saves. Sutter also won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Fireman of the Year Award. In addition to a league-leading 28 saves in 1980, Sutter recorded a 2.64 ERA and finished with a 5–8 win–loss record in 60 games. His strikeout total, which had been over 100 the previous three seasons, fell to 76 that year and he never finished with more than 77 strikeouts in any of his remaining seasons.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1981–1984) ===
Sutter was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Leon Durham, Ken Reitz, and a player to be named later in December 1980. He made his fifth consecutive All-Star Game in 1981. He recorded 25 saves, registered a 2.62 ERA, and finished fifth in the NL Cy Young Award voting.

Sutter registered 36 saves in 1982, finishing third in the Cy Young Award voting. Sutter earned the save in the pennant-clinching victory in the NLCS. The Cardinals won the 1982 World Series and Sutter is credited with two saves in that Series, including the Series-clinching save in Game 7 which ended with a strikeout of Gorman Thomas.

In 1983, Sutter recorded a 9–10 win–loss record and a 4.23 ERA; while his save total declined to 21. In April of that year, Sutter executed a rare unassisted pickoff play: as Bill Madlock of the Pittsburgh Pirates took a long lead off first base, he became distracted by Cardinals first baseman Keith Hernandez. Sutter ran off the mound to tag Madlock out.

Sutter, who won both the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and The Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award again in 1981, 1982, and 1984, tied Dan Quisenberry&#x27;s major league record for most saves in a season (45) in 1984. (His MLB record was broken by Dave Righetti (46) in 1986 and his NL record was broken by Lee Smith (47) in 1991.) During Sutter&#x27;s record-breaking season, he pitched a career-high innings. It was one of five seasons in which Sutter threw more than 100 innings.

===Atlanta Braves (1985–1988)===
Sutter joined the Atlanta Braves in December 1984 as a free agent. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Sutter&#x27;s six-year contract paid him $4.8 million and placed another $4.8 million into a deferred payment account at 13 percent interest. The newspaper estimated that the account would pay Sutter $1.3 million per year for 30 years after the initial six seasons of the contract. Sutter said that he was attracted to the Braves because of Atlanta&#x27;s scenery and his respect for Ted Turner and Dale Murphy.

Before the start of the 1985 season, Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog commented on facing the season without Sutter. &quot;To me, Bruce is the best there ever was,&quot; Herzog said. &quot;Losing him is like Kansas City losing Dan Quisenberry...I told Bruce, &#x27;Look, you&#x27;ve taken care of your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren. Now, if I get fired in July, will you take care of me and Mary Lou?&#x27;&quot;

When Sutter arrived in Atlanta, only two Braves pitchers had ever earned 25 or more saves in a season; the Braves in 1984 had recorded 49 saves as a team, just four more than Sutter&#x27;s own total. In 1985, Sutter&#x27;s ERA rose to 4.48 and his saves total decreased to 23. By the end of the season, he was bothered by nerve impingement in the right shoulder. He underwent surgery on the shoulder after the season, and recovered in time to appear in spring training in mid-March 1986.

Near the end of March 1986, Sutter commented on his recovery, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m throwing the ball as hard as I ever have, but it&#x27;s just not getting there as fast. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen. I just have to keep throwing and see. So far, there have been no setbacks. Today I felt great, no problems.&quot; Sutter started the season with a 2–0 record and a 4.34 ERA in 16 games. He was placed on the disabled list in May due to arm problems. On July 31, manager Chuck Tanner announced that Sutter would probably not return to pitching in that season.

Sutter underwent shoulder surgery in February 1987, the third procedure performed on his arm, in an attempt to remove scar tissue and to promote nerve healing. To recover from the surgery, he was required to miss the entire 1987 season. He returned to limited action with the Braves in 1988. In late May, Sutter earned saves on consecutive nights and sportswriter Jerome Holtzman characterized his pitching as &quot;vintage Sutter&quot;. He finished the year with a 1–4 record, a 4.76 ERA and 14 saves in 38 games pitched. In late September, he had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.

==Retirement==
By March 1989, Sutter was dealing with a severely torn rotator cuff and he admitted that he would be unlikely to return to baseball. &quot;There&#x27;s probably a 99.9 percent chance I won&#x27;t be able to pitch again,&quot; he said. General Manager Bobby Cox said that &quot;Bruce is not going to retire. We&#x27;re not going to release him. We&#x27;ll put him on the 21-day disabled list, then probably move him to the 60-day disabled list later on.&quot; Sutter planned to reevaluate his condition after resting his arm for three to four months. The Braves released him that November.

Sutter retired with exactly 300 saves — at the time, the third-highest total in history, behind Rollie Fingers (341) and Goose Gossage (302). His career saves total was an NL record until broken by Lee Smith in 1993.

==Hall of Fame==

Sutter appeared on his thirteenth Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2006. Sportswriter Matthew Leach of MLB.com referred to this ballot as Sutter&#x27;s best chance for induction; he pointed out that Sutter would only be eligible for two more Hall of Fame ballots. Nearing the end of his eligibility, Sutter said he did not think about induction very often. &quot;It&#x27;s just an honor to be on the ballot, but it&#x27;s not something I think that much about. I have no control over it. ... It&#x27;s out of my hands. It&#x27;s the voters, it&#x27;s in the voters&#x27; hands. There&#x27;s nothing I can do about it. I can&#x27;t pitch anymore... There&#x27;s a lot of guys that I think should be in that aren&#x27;t in. It&#x27;s for the special few people to get into the Hall of Fame. It shouldn&#x27;t be easy to get in&quot;, he said. On January 10, 2006, Sutter was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his 13th year of eligibility by receiving 400 votes out of a possible 520 (76.9%). He was the fourth relief pitcher inducted, and the first pitcher inducted without starting a game.

MLB.com columnist Mike Bauman attributed the delay in Sutter&#x27;s Hall of Fame election to several factors. He pointed out that Sutter&#x27;s first five strong seasons were with the Cubs, a team that did not receive much attention during those years. He also noted that the closer role was relatively new in baseball history. Finally, he wrote that Sutter&#x27;s candidacy was hurt because his career was cut short by injuries.

At his Hall of Fame induction that July, Sutter was the only former MLB player inducted. However, he was joined by 17 Negro league baseball players. During his induction speech, Sutter said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t played baseball for 18 years now and I&#x27;m getting more sentimental as I get older. You start losing family members and you start losing friends. There are teammates who have passed on. You start thinking of them as you put together a speech. I&#x27;m not usually an emotional guy. My kids said the first time they ever saw me cry was when I got that phone call [telling him that he was elected]. Now today. I guess a lot of people have seen me crying now.&quot; Johnny Bench and Ozzie Smith wore decorative beards to the induction speech in honor of Sutter. Sutter&#x27;s Hall of Fame plaque depicts him wearing a Cardinals cap.

==Other honors==

Sutter&#x27;s number 42, which he wore throughout his career, was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals during a ceremony at Busch Stadium on September 17, 2006. He shares his retired number with Jackie Robinson, whose number 42 was retired by all MLB teams in 1997.

In November 2010, Sutter was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame. A few months later, Whitey Herzog accepted the honor in place of Sutter, whose wife was hospitalized with cancer. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Sutter among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

==Personal life and death==
Sutter remained in Atlanta with his wife and three sons after retirement. His son Chad was a catcher who played for Tulane University and was selected by the New York Yankees in the 23rd round (711th overall) of the 1999 amateur draft. Chad played one season in the minor leagues and later joined the coaching staff of the Tulane baseball team.

On August 23, 2010, Sutter was named a minor league consultant for the Philadelphia Phillies. He was hired to evaluate pitching prospects at the team&#x27;s Double-A and Triple-A affiliates.

Sutter died at the age of 69 while in hospice in Cartersville, Georgia, on October 13, 2022, after a recent diagnosis of cancer.

Upon the news of his death, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said, &quot;Bruce Sutter was the first pitcher to reach the Hall of Fame without starting a game, and he was one of the key figures who foreshadowed how the use of relievers would evolve. Bruce will be remembered as one of the best pitchers in the histories of two of our most historic franchises.&quot;

<doc id="514150" wikidata="Q2715136" url="?curid=514150" title="Belgarion">
<text>Belgarion (also called Garion) is a fictional character and the chief protagonist in &quot;The Belgariad&quot; and &quot;The Malloreon&quot;, two fantasy epics written by David Eddings.

Garion is the distant nephew of Polgara the Sorceress and the distant grandson of Belgarath the Sorcerer, though in truth his lineage is many times removed from them, through Belgarath&#x27;s other daughter and Polgara&#x27;s twin sister, Beldaran, the wife of Riva Iron-Grip, the first king (and founder) of Riva. Garion&#x27;s father was Geran, a stonecutter in the Sendarian village of Annath and hidden heir to the Rivan throne. His mother, Ildera, was the daughter of a clan chief of Algaria.

Geran and Ildera were killed after a Grolim sent her into premature labor while he had Pol out looking for Garions grandmother. After Garion&#x27;s birth he set fire to their home, and he (Garion) was taken by his aunt to live on Faldor&#x27;s farm. He lived there in ignorance for 14 years. He was watched all his life by Chamdar, the man who killed his parents, until he would be old enough to be coming into his talents and could be used as a pawn. However, after the &quot;Orb of Aldur&quot; was stolen, he was swept along as his aunt and grandfather left to search for it. Along the way he learned many things about himself and his family, including the fact he&#x27;s an immortal sorcerer—and is eventually revealed to be the Heir to the Rivan Throne—after which he begrudgingly becomes king. He also falls in love with Ce&#x27;Nedra, the Tolnedran princess, who reciprocates, and is forced to marry him by treaty.

He then discovers his destiny—destroying the Dark God Torak—and to avoid a bloody war with the Angaraks, goes with his grandfather and Silk on a journey which ends in an epic duel that he ultimately wins by slaying Torak. He is then married to Ce&#x27;Nedra and has a baby boy.

Several years later, during which he matures considerably, his son, Geran, is kidnapped to be the bearer of a new Dark Prophecy. Garion follows his son&#x27;s kidnapper on a trek across Mallorea, and during this time he conceives another child, meets his grandmother, befriends the Emperor of Mallorea and the King of the Murgos (who have been enemies of his allies for generations), and chooses his successor as the &quot;Child of Light.&quot; His successor ends the eternal conflict, becoming a God in the process. He returns home for the birth of his daughter Beldaran, although he is told by the Prophecy to prepare for a few more children along the way, as he and Ce&#x27;Nedra have hugely increased lifespans, reproductive and otherwise.

During the two series, he collects various titles, which he tends to use only when it suits him. From the book &quot;Castle of Wizardry&quot; onwards, he holds the titles &quot;King of Riva,&quot; &quot;Overlord of the West&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Western Sea,&quot; &quot;Keeper of the Orb of Aldur,&quot; and after &quot;Enchanter&#x27;s End Game&quot; takes on the title of &quot;Godslayer.&quot; Through many of the books he also bears the title &quot;Child of Light&quot; (he also bears this name in the Mrin and Darine Codices) Among his most important accomplishments are the slaying of the god Torak in &quot;Enchanters&#x27; End Game&quot;, and his decision to choose his successor for the term &#x27;Child of Light&#x27; at the Place Which Is No More in &quot;The Seeress of Kell.&quot;

==Personality==
Raised on Faldor&#x27;s Farm, Garion demonstrates all the attributes of a Sendarian farmer, which he extends to ruling Riva with relative ease. He has a streak of solid common sense, honesty, and unassuming charm. As he matures, Garion uses these qualities to deal with more &#x27;world-wise&#x27; monarchs and politicians in a manner they are unfamiliar with, thus making Garion one of the most powerful rulers. He&#x27;s also grown duplicitous enough to use his rural background as a way of pointing that he has not had instruction in intricate proprieties of certain groups—the Mimbrate chivalry and the obscure Sorcerer&#x27;s code of ethics—assuming there actually is one and Belgarath wasn&#x27;t dodging questions. As he put it, &quot;Let&#x27;s agree I don&#x27;t have very good manners, and you can answer me anyway.&quot;

He is very private with a strict sense of honor- his time among the Sendars has made him almost prudish, though in contrast he is very worldly and aware not everyone thinks like him. However, he has a tendency to act or speak without thinking, which can lead him into trouble. He is also ruled largely by his emotions, though this trait is much more controlled in the Malloreon. He is naturally loving and will go to any lengths to protect those he cares about, but when annoyed he has a fearsome temper. He is also highly stubborn and proud, often refusing to admit he&#x27;s wrong even when he knows he is. He is also highly intelligent, though he was illiterate till he was 15, and he tends to hide this and use it as an advantage on people who think he&#x27;s stupid.

==Powers and abilities==
Garion has an exceptional talent as a sorcerer being able to use the Will and the Word, and like his aunt and grandfather has a drastically extended lifespan (being the disciple of a God allows them to live an infinite amount of time.) However, he is initially unaware of the consequences of his actions e.g. he almost triggers an Ice Age whilst creating a thunderstorm; almost dies when he attempted to revive the colt in the &#x27;Cave of the Gods&#x27; and sinking into mud when trying to throw a boulder - though this is usually because of his lack of education and not thinking things all the way through. This aptitude is (in part at least) because of his lineage, which includes Polgara and Belgarath - though it is subtly hinted he is at least as strong, if not stronger than his grandfather. The first measure of his power is shown in Queen of Sorcery when Maas says to Salmissra his power is &quot;&quot;untried and undirected but is very strong. He could destroy you quite by accident&quot;.&quot; In the Belgariad he mainly uses &quot;spontaneous sorcery&quot; meaning he does it without consciously gathering and releasing his will. The Prophecy also acts through him on many occasions when he is incapable of protecting himself. In the Malloreon his powers are more mature and he has much greater control, though he tends to only do small things with it, leaving the more complicated things to his family as they have more experience.

Being the &quot;Child of Light&quot;, he has the Prophecy of the Light in his head who tells him how and when to use his power, as well as providing information that is necessary. This voice is quite separate from him with its own personality, and it often leaves him for long periods. It has protected him on a number of occasions, and has developed a fondness for him - often acting like a family member with unwanted advice and criticism.

As the keeper of the Orb of Aldur, and one of the only remaining descendants of Riva Iron-Grip, Belgarion was one of three people able to touch it without being destroyed - an ability he now shares only with Eriond (a God) and his only son Geran (named after Garion&#x27;s father). This in itself grants him huge magical power, allowing him to destroy continents if he deems it necessary; however, he rarely uses it, as the childlike mind of the Orb is enthusiastic and eager to please Garion, and as such has a tendency to overdo things (such as when it empowered Garion to knock over the gates of Jarviksholm during the attack on the city, or one point when the Orb, due to misinterpreting a stray thought as a literal request, began enthusiastically explaining to Garion how he could rearrange the stars in the sky to spell out his name, implying that Garion with the Orb has enough power to simultaneously move multiple stars across interstellar distances.) He is also, due to his connection with the Prophecy, able to recite the &quot;Book of Alorn&quot; from memory, despite having never actually read it. In fact, Belgarath claims he could have done so from the cradle if he&#x27;d been asked.

His companions on his adventures have taught him many skills, and on these journeys he has gained a great deal of practical experience. His tutorship under Silk has rendered him capable of moving silently when needed, as well as to lie effectively and he is good at gathering information from local sources. He is also adept in the Drasnian secret language, which is practised using hand signs. He has also learned how to use a variety of different weapons, and as he is a student of Hettar, Mandorallen, and Barak, he is a master swordsman, capable of taking out entire battalions single handed. His use of the &quot;Sword of the Rivan King&quot; has caused him to be feared in most parts of the world; as his son puts it: &quot;when Father got his sword out, most sensible people ran for cover.&quot;

His extensive travels have given him contacts in all parts of the world, including the Emperor of Mallorea and the King of the Murgos. His upbringing also makes him aware of the common people. He has a shopkeeper friend in Riva who he periodically visits to listen to what&#x27;s troubling commoners. Rather than use this to ferret out secrets, he usually applies what he learns to smoothing out injustices, such as an unfair tax.

<doc id="514170" wikidata="Q684140" url="?curid=514170" title="Pappy Boyington">
<text>Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington (December 4, 1912 – January 11, 1988) was an American combat pilot who was a United States Marine Corps fighter ace during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross. A Marine aviator with the Pacific fleet in 1941, Boyington joined the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; (1st American Volunteer Group) of the Republic of China Air Force and saw combat in Burma in late 1941 and 1942 during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

In September 1942, Boyington rejoined the Marine Corps. In early 1943, he deployed to the South Pacific and began flying combat missions in the F4U Corsair fighter. On August 14, 1943, he took command of Marine fighter squadron VMF-214 (&quot;Black Sheep&quot;).

In January 1944, Boyington, outnumbered by Japanese &quot;Zero&quot; planes, was shot down into the Pacific Ocean after downing one of the enemy planes. He was captured by a Japanese submarine crew and was held as a prisoner of war for more than a year and a half. He was released shortly after the surrender of Japan.

The television series &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; was inspired by Boyington and his men in the &quot;Black Sheep&quot; squadron. It ran for two seasons in the late 1970s.

==Early life==
Born on December 4, 1912, in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, he moved with his family to the logging town of St. Maries at age three and lived there until age 12. He is of part Brulé Sioux descent. He then lived in Tacoma, Washington, where he was a wrestler at Lincoln High School. He took his first flight at St. Maries when he was six years old, with Clyde Pangborn, who later became the first pilot to fly over the Pacific Ocean non-stop.

After graduation from high school in 1930, Boyington attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he was a member of the Army ROTC and joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He was on the Husky wrestling and swimming teams, and for a time he held the Pacific Northwest Intercollegiate middleweight wrestling title. He spent his summers working in Washington in a mining camp and at a logging camp and with the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Fire Protective Association in road construction. He graduated in 1934 with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering. Boyington married shortly after graduation and worked as a draftsman and engineer for Boeing in Seattle.

==Military career==
Boyington began his military training in college as a member of Army ROTC and became a cadet captain. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Reserve in June 1934, and then served two months of active duty with the 630th Coast Artillery at Fort Worden, Washington. In the spring of 1935, he applied for flight training under the Aviation Cadet Act, but he discovered that it excluded married men. Boyington had grown up as Gregory Hallenbeck, and assumed his stepfather, Ellsworth J. Hallenbeck, was his father. When he obtained a copy of his birth certificate, he learned that his father was actually Charles Boyington, a dentist, and that his parents had divorced when he was an infant. As there was no record of any Gregory Boyington ever being married, he enrolled as a U.S. Marine Corps aviation cadet using that name.

===United States Marine Corps===
On June 13, 1935, he transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. He returned to inactive duty on July 16. On February 18, 1936, Boyington accepted an appointment as an aviation cadet in the Marine Corps Reserve. He was assigned to Naval Air Station Pensacola for flight training. Boyington was designated a Naval Aviator on March 11, 1937, then transferred to Marine Corps Base Quantico for duty with Aircraft One, Fleet Marine Force. He was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on July 1, 1937, in order to accept a second lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the Marine Corps the following day. Boyington attended The Basic School in Philadelphia from July 1938 to January 1939. On completion of the course, he was assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Group at the San Diego Naval Air Station. He took part in fleet problems off the aircraft carriers and . Promoted to first lieutenant on November 4, 1940, Boyington returned to Pensacola as an instructor in December.

===Flying Tigers===
While serving as an instructor at Pensacola, Boyington punched another officer during a disagreement and was informed by his superiors that he likely faced a court-martial. At this time, representatives looking for volunteer fighter pilots to fight in China visited Pensacola. Boyington quickly resigned his commission in the Marine Corps on August 26, 1941, to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company, which was a civilian firm that contracted to staff a Special Air Unit to defend China and the Burma Road. This later became known as the American Volunteer Group, the famed Flying Tigers in Burma. During his time with the Tigers, Boyington became a flight leader. He was frequently in trouble with the commander of the outfit, Claire Chennault and reportedly was disliked and distrusted by the other pilots in the organization, who considered Boyington a &quot;liar and a drunk.&quot; Boyington was officially credited with two Japanese aircraft destroyed in the air and one and a half on the ground. Boyington always claimed that he shot down six in the air, a claim accepted by the Marine Corps. In April 1942, he broke his contract with the American Volunteer Group and returned on his own to the United States.


===Return to the Marine Corps===
On September 29, 1942, he rejoined the Marine Corps and took a major&#x27;s commission. The Marine Corps needed experienced combat pilots, and in early 1943 he was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 11 of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and deployed to the South Pacific as executive officer of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 122 (VMFA-122) operating from Guadalcanal until April 1943. While assigned to VMFA-122, Boyington shot down no enemy aircraft. From July to August 1943, he commanded Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 112. In September 1943, he became commanding officer of Marine Fighter Squadron 214 (VMF-214), better known by its nickname, the &quot;Black Sheep Squadron&quot;.

Boyington received the nickname &quot;Gramps&quot;, because at age 31, he was a decade older than most of the Marines serving under him. The name &quot;Gramps&quot; was changed to &quot;Pappy&quot; in a variation on &quot;The Whiffenpoof Song&quot; whose new lyrics had been written by Paul &quot;Moon&quot; Mullen, one of his pilots, and this version was picked up by war correspondents. Boyington is best known for his exploits in the Vought F4U Corsair in VMF-214. During periods of intense activity in the Russell Islands-New Georgia and Bougainville-New Britain-New Ireland areas, he shot down 14 enemy fighter planes in 32 days. By December 27, 1943, his record had climbed to 25.

A typical feat was his attack on Kahili airdrome at the southern tip of Bougainville on October 17, 1943. Boyington and 24 fighters circled the field, where 60 hostile aircraft were based, goading the enemy into sending up a large force. In the fierce battle that followed, 20 enemy aircraft were shot down, while the Black Sheep returned to their base without loss. Boyington&#x27;s squadron, flying from the island of Vella Lavella, offered to down a Japanese Zero for every baseball cap sent to them by major league players in the World Series. They received 20 caps and shot down more than that number of enemy aircraft.

On January 3, 1944, he beat World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker&#x27;s record of 26 enemy planes destroyed, before Boyington was shot down, though his last two kills for a total of 28 were confirmed after his return. On that mission, 48 American fighters, including four planes from the Black Sheep Squadron (plus planes from VF-33 and VMF-211), were sent on a sweep over Rabaul. Boyington was tactical commander of the flight and arrived over the target at 8:00 am. He was seen to shoot down his 26th plane, but he then became mixed in the general melee of dogfighting planes and was not seen or heard from during the battle, nor did he return with his squadron. Boyington&#x27;s wingman, Captain George Ashmun, was killed in action. In later 
years, Masajiro &quot;Mike&quot; Kawato claimed to have been the pilot who shot down Boyington. He described the combat in two books and numerous public appearances (often with Boyington), but this claim was eventually &quot;disproven&quot;, though Kawato repeated his story until his death. Kawato was present during the action in which Boyington was shot down, as one of 70 Japanese fighters which engaged about 30 American fighters.
The IJN Forces were the 204th Kōkūtai and 253d Kōkūtai (Naval Aviation Group Formations). The 204th Kōkūtai losses are unknown; however the 253d Kōkūtai reported 1 Zero shot down and Pilot slightly injured.

===Prisoner of war===
Following a determined but futile search, Boyington was declared missing in action (MIA). He had been picked up on 3 January 1944 by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine and taken to Rabaul, becoming a prisoner of war. (&quot;I-181&quot; was sunk 13 days after picking him up.) According to Boyington&#x27;s autobiography, he was never accorded official POW status by the Japanese, and his captivity was not reported to the Red Cross.

He spent the rest of the war, some 20 months, in Japanese prison camps. After being held temporarily at Rabaul and then Truk, where he survived the massive U.S. Navy raid known as &quot;Operation Hailstone&quot;, he was transported first to Ōfuna and finally to Ōmori Prison Camp near Tokyo. During that time, he was selected for temporary promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel. A fellow American prisoner of war was Medal of Honor recipient submarine Captain Richard O&#x27;Kane. At Ōfuna, Boyington was interned with the former Olympic distance runner and downed aviator Lieutenant Louis Zamperini.

On August 29, 1945, after the atomic bombs and the Japanese capitulation, Boyington was liberated from Japanese custody at Omori Prison Camp. Boyington returned to the United States at Naval Air Station Alameda on September 12, 1945, where he was met by 21 former squadron members from VMF-214. That night, a party for him was held at the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco that was covered by &quot;Life&quot; in its issue October 1, 1945. The coverage of the party marked the first time that the magazine had ever shown people consuming alcohol. Prior to his arrival, on September 6, he accepted his temporary lieutenant colonel&#x27;s commission in the Marine Corps.

===Postwar===

Shortly after his return to the U.S., as a lieutenant colonel, Boyington was ordered to Washington, DC, to receive the nation&#x27;s highest military honor—the Medal of Honor—from the president. The medal had been awarded by the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt in March 1944 and held in the capital until such time as he could receive it. On October 4, 1945, Boyington received the Navy Cross from the Commandant of the Marine Corps for the Rabaul raid. On October 5, &quot;Nimitz Day&quot;, some other sailors, marines, and he who were also awarded the Medal of Honor were presented their medals at the White House by President Harry S. Truman.

Following the receipt of his Medal of Honor and Navy Cross, Boyington made a Victory Bond tour. Originally ordered to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, he was later directed to report to the commanding general, Marine Air West Coast, Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, California. He retired from the Marine Corps on August 1, 1947, and because he was specially commended for the performance of duty in actual combat, he was promoted to colonel.

==Later life==
Boyington was a tough, hard-living character known for being unorthodox. He was also a heavy drinker, which plagued him in the years after the war and possibly contributed to his multiple divorces. He freely admitted that during the two years he spent as a POW his health improved because of the enforced sobriety. He worked various civilian jobs, including refereeing and participating in professional wrestling matches.

===Author===
Boyington wrote his autobiography, &quot;Baa Baa, Black Sheep&quot;, published in 1958. He wrote a novel about the American Volunteer Group, &quot;Tonya&quot;, a spy story with characters based on real individuals. Some of the character names were derived by transposing the syllables of the names of the people who inspired them (&quot;Ross Dicky&quot; for Dick Rossi, for example).

===TV series===
Many people know of him from the mid-1970s television show &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, a drama about the Black Sheep squadron based very loosely on Boyington&#x27;s memoir, with Boyington portrayed by Robert Conrad. Boyington had a short walk-on role as a visiting general for two episodes in the first season (&quot;The Deadliest Enemy of All: Part 2&quot; and &quot;The Fastest Gun&quot;) and one episode in the second season (&quot;Ten&#x27;ll Get You Five&quot;) of the show.

Many of Boyington&#x27;s men were irate over the show, charging it was mostly fiction and presented a glamorized portrayal of Boyington. On the television show, Boyington was depicted as owning a Bull Terrier dog, named &quot;Meatball&quot;, although Boyington did not own a dog while deployed in the South Pacific Theater. Boyington frequently told interviewers and audiences that the television series was fiction and only slightly related to fact, calling it &quot;hogwash and Hollywood hokum&quot;.

===Publicity===

While paintings and publicity photographs often show Boyington with aircraft number 86 &quot;LuluBelle&quot; covered in victory flags, he had not flown this in combat. In fact, he rarely flew the same aircraft more than a few times. Reportedly, he would choose the F4U in the worst shape, so that none of his pilots would be afraid to fly their own aircraft. A publicity photo taken of Boyington in F4U-1A Corsair number 86 was taken at Espiritu Santo (code named BUTTON), in the New Hebrides on 26 November 1943. It was taken while VMA-214 was on leave between their first and second combat tours with Boyington as the commanding officer. Though Boyington claimed after the war that the name of the plane was &quot;LuluBelle&quot;, according to Bruce Gamble&#x27;s analysis, it was most likely called &quot;LucyBelle&quot;.

Boyington was part of the 1981 Black Sheep reunion in Washington, DC, hosted by the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum. Reunion planning was initiated by Boyington&#x27;s namesake Gregory Tucker, son of Black Sheep pilot Burney Tucker. The reunion was scheduled to coincide with the dedication of a restored F4U-1 Corsair exhibit. The dedication program was attended by 18 Black Sheep veterans, museum dignitaries, and astronaut Michael Collins representing the Ling-Temco-Vought Company (successor to Corsair manufacturer Vought). The program included a banquet recognizing all of the Black Sheep veterans. At the request of museum personnel, Boyington climbed into the cockpit for pictures, confirmed the accuracy of the cockpit restoration, and answered a question from a young fan: &quot;Yeah, I could fly it today, if it was airworthy.&quot; He autographed the Corsair with a marker pen in one of the landing gear wells, saying, in effect, that it was a Corsair in the best condition he had ever seen. The Corsair hangs from the ceiling at the museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.

In 1957, he appeared as a guest contestant on the television panel show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. In 1976, Boyington appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; with actor Robert Conrad and was interviewed about the drama &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;.

==Family==
Boyington had three children with his first wife Helen Clark. They married after his graduation from the University of Washington in 1934. She was 17 years old. One daughter (Janet Boyington) took her own life; one son (Gregory Boyington, Jr.) graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1960 and retired from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. His youngest child was Gloria Boyington.

During World War II, his three children were placed in the charge of their aunt and grandmother after Boyington divorced Helen when he returned to America in 1941 after serving with the Flying Tigers. He charged his ex-wife with neglecting the children. Boyington married Frances Baker, 32, of Los Angeles on January 8, 1946.

His third marriage was to Delores Tatum, 33, on October 28, 1959. It was the second marriage for Tatum, and the third for the 46-year-old Boyington. Boyington and Delores had one adopted child. He married Josephine Wilson Moseman of Fresno in 1978. This marriage was his fourth.

==Death==
A heavy smoker throughout his adult life, Boyington died of lung cancer on January 11, 1988, at age 75, in Fresno, California. Boyington is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His January 15 interment included full military honors accorded to a Medal of Honor recipient, including a missing man fly-by conducted by the F-4 Phantom IIs of VMFA-321 &quot;Hells Angels&quot; of the Marine Air Reserve Training Detachment based at the Naval Air Facility located on Andrews Air Force Base. Before his flight from Fresno, VMA-214 (the current incarnation of the Black Sheep Squadron) did a flyby. They intended to perform a missing man formation, but one of the four aircraft suffered a mechanical problem. After the burial service for Boyington, one of his friends, Fred Losch, looked down at the headstone next to which he was standing, that of boxing legend Joe Louis, and remarked that &quot;Ol&#x27; Pappy wouldn&#x27;t have to go far to find a good fight.&quot;

==Military awards==
Boyington&#x27;s military decorations and awards include:

===Medal of Honor citation===
Boyington&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation reads:


&quot;The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to

for service as set forth in the following

CITATION:

For extraordinary heroism above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer of Marine Fighting Squadron TWO FOURTEEN in action against enemy Japanese forces in Central Solomons Area from September 12, 1943, to January 3, 1944. Consistently outnumbered throughout successive hazardous flights over heavily defended hostile territory, Major Boyington struck at the enemy with daring and courageous persistence, leading his squadron into combat with devastating results to Japanese shipping, shore installations and aerial forces. Resolute in his efforts to inflict crippling damage on the enemy, Major BOYINGTON led a formation of twenty-four fighters over Kahili on October 17, and persistently circling the airdrome where sixty hostile aircraft were grounded, boldly challenged the Japanese to send up planes. Under his brilliant command, our fighters shot down twenty enemy craft in the ensuing action without the loss of a single ship. A superb airman and determined fighter against overwhelming odds, Major BOYINGTON personally destroyed 26 of the many Japanese planes shot down by his squadron and by his forceful leadership developed the combat readiness in his command which was a distinctive factor in the Allied aerial achievements in this vitally strategic area.

===Navy Cross citation===
Citation:
:The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Major Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington (MCSN: 0-5254), United States Marine Corps Reserve, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer and a Pilot of Marine Fighting Squadron TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN (VMF-214), Marine Air Group ELEVEN (MAG-11), FIRST Marine Aircraft Wing, during action against enemy aerial forces in the New Britain Island Area on 3 January 1944. Climaxing a period of duty conspicuous for exceptional combat achievement, Major Boyington led a formation of Allied planes on a fighter sweep over Rabaul against a vastly superior number of hostile fighters. Diving in a steep run into the climbing Zeros, he made a daring attack, sending one Japanese fighter to destruction in flames. A tenacious and fearless airman under extremely hazardous conditions, Major Boyington succeeded in communicating to those who served with him, the brilliant and effective tactics developed through a careful study of enemy techniques, and led his men into combat with inspiring and courageous determination. His intrepid leadership and gallant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon the United States Naval Service.

==Honors==
Boyington&#x27;s honors include:

===Airport renaming===

In August 2007, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene airport was renamed the &quot;Coeur d&#x27;Alene Airport–Pappy Boyington Field&quot; in his honor and dedicated the following month. An independent documentary film called &quot;Pappy Boyington Field&quot; was produced by filmmaker Kevin Gonzalez in 2008, chronicling the grassroots campaign to add the commemorative name. The film showcases many of the local veterans who were involved with the campaign, as well as the personal insights into Boyington&#x27;s life provided by his son, Gregory Boyington, Jr., and the actor Robert Conrad, who portrayed him in the television series.

===University of Washington Medal of Honor Memorial===

In February 2006, a resolution recommending a memorial be erected to honor Boyington for his service during World War II was raised and defeated at the University of Washington (Boyington&#x27;s alma mater). Some people did not believe the resolution&#x27;s sponsor had fully addressed the financial and logistical problems of installing a memorial and questioned the widely held assumption that all warriors and acts of war are automatically worthy of memorialization. The story was picked up by some blogs and conservative news outlets, focusing on two statements made by student senators during the meeting. One student senator, Ashley Miller, said that the university already had many monuments to &quot;rich, white men&quot; (Boyington claimed partial Sioux ancestry and was not rich); another questioned whether the university should memorialize a person who killed others, summarized in the minutes as saying &quot;she didn&#x27;t believe a member of the Marine Corps was an example of the sort of person UW wanted to produce.&quot; After its defeat, a new version of the original resolution was submitted that called for a memorial to all eight UW alumni who received the Medal of Honor. On April 4, 2006, the resolution passed. Privately funded, it was completed in time for a Veterans Day dedication in November 2009. In addition to Boyington, it honors Deming Bronson, Bruce Crandall, Robert Galer, John Hawk, Robert Leisy, William Nakamura, and Archie Van Winkle.

===Naval Aviation Hall of Honor===
Boyington was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor in 1994, located at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida.

===NROL-82 Mission Patch===
Boyington was the inspiration for the NROL-82 mission patch that launched in April 2021. (&quot;GPB&quot; on the shoulder patch and an F4U Corsair in the background)

===National Aviation Hall of Fame===
In 2019, Boyington was inducted into The National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Frederik Hahn (born September 29, 1971 in Heidelberg), better known by his stage name Torch, is a German rapper. He is also known as DJ Haitian Star. He was among the first German rappers who began rapping in German in the mid-1980s in Heidelberg, laying the foundation for the success of German hip hop music. In 1985, Afrika Bambaataa named him king of the first German chapter of the Zulu Nation and also gave him the title: Overlord of Sound &amp; Culture.

== Career ==
In 1987, Torch founded the group Advanced Chemistry with Toni L, Linguist, Gee-One and DJ Mike MD. In 1992, the song &quot;Fremd im eigenen Land&quot; (&quot;Stranger in one&#x27;s own country&quot;) became the group&#x27;s first hit. Primarily due to exposure on the cable television network MTV, the song garnered attention outside of Germany&#x27;s hip hop scene, which was still quite small at the time.

In 2000 he rapped with KRS-One and MC Rene on DJ Tomekk&#x27;s Single &quot;Return of Hip-Hop&quot;, which placed in the German charts for 9 weeks. In the joint video, the hip hop was brought to the hospital in an ambulance and revived by nurses.

Torch&#x27;s first (and so far only) solo-album was &quot;Blauer Samt&quot; (&quot;Blue Velvet&quot;), released in 2000.

He worked with international artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Freestyle (Ex-Arsonists), Grandmaster Caz (Cold Crush Bros), Jurassic 5, KRS1 (BDP), Melle Mel, Missing Linx (Al Tariq-Ex Beatnuts), Whipper Whip &amp; Virtuoso (Boston), Fréro-La Mixture (France). After his introduction to Bambaataa, Torch was given the task of heading up the very first German chapter of the Zulu nation as well as collaborating for the socially conscious German hip-hop concert, &#x27;Rap against the Right&#x27;. Torch was chosen for these tasks because of his social consciousness as purveyed through his music and lyrics. Advanced Chemistry (and specifically Torch) have expressed the desire to remain largely underground while other German hip hop groups have sought stardom, but a common view shared by these other groups and Torch is their view on &quot;Americanness.&quot; Author Timothy Brown cites Torch as stating, &quot;What the American do is exotic for us because we don&#x27;t live like they do. What they do seems to be more interesting and newer. But not for me. For me it&#x27;s more exciting to experience my fellow Germans in new contexts... For me it&#x27;s interesting to see what the kids try to do that&#x27;s different from what I know.&quot;

He is also travelling the World as DJ Haitian Star where he has performed at the Battle of the Year (Germany), Jazz Festival Montreux (Switzerland), Hip Hop Kemp (Czech Republic), Zulu Anniversary (NY/USA)... He shared the decks with DJs like: Z-Trip (US), David Rodigan (UK), Grandmaster Flash (US), Kool Herc (US), Tee (Japan), Supreme/Hijack (UK), Defcut (CH), Stylewarz (D), Marc Hype (D). 

2021 Torch published a book by the name &quot;Blauer Samt&quot;. And released his own Wine by the same name.

<text>Tax returns in the United States are reports filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or with the state or local tax collection agency (California Franchise Tax Board, for example) containing information used to calculate income tax or other taxes. Tax returns are generally prepared using forms prescribed by the IRS or other applicable taxing authority.

==Federal returns==

Under the Internal Revenue Code returns can be classified as either &quot;tax returns&quot; or &quot;information returns&quot;, although the term &quot;tax return&quot; is sometimes used to describe both kinds of returns in a broad sense. Tax returns, in the more narrow sense, are reports of tax liabilities and payments, often including financial information used to compute the tax. A very common federal tax form is IRS Form 1040.

A tax return provides information so that the taxation authority can check on the taxpayer&#x27;s calculations, or can determine the amount of tax owed if the taxpayer is not required to calculate that amount. In contrast, an information return is a declaration by some person, such as a third party, providing economic information about one or more potential taxpayers.

===Information returns===
Information returns are reports used to transmit information about income, receipts or other matters that may affect tax liabilities. For example, Form W-2 and Form 1099 are used to report on the amount of income that an employer, independent contractor, broker, or other payer pays to a taxpayer. A company, employer, or party which has paid income (or, in a few cases, proceeds that may ultimately be determined not to be income) to a taxpayer is required to file the applicable information return directly with the IRS. A copy of the information return is also sent directly to the payee. These procedures enable the IRS to make reasonably sure that taxpayers report income correctly.

===Tax returns===
The filing of Federal tax returns is required under federal law. Individuals who receive more than the statutory minimum amount of gross income must file. The standard U.S. individual tax return is Form 1040. There are several variations of this form, such as the 1040EZ and the 1040A, as well as many supplemental forms. U.S. citizens and residents who realize gross income in excess of a specified amount (adjusted annually for inflation) are required by law to file Federal income tax returns (and pay remaining income taxes if applicable). Gross income includes most kinds of income regardless of whether the income arises from legitimate businesses. Income from the sale of illegal drugs, for example, is taxable. Many criminals, such as Al Capone, are indicted not only for their non-tax crimes, but for failure to file Federal income tax returns (and pay income taxes).

Many Americans find the process of filling out the tax forms more onerous than paying the taxes themselves. A recent survey by Credello uncovered that only 13% of Americans file their taxes completely on their own and 53% rely on an online software system. Many companies offer free and paid options for reducing the tedious labor involved in preparing one&#x27;s tax return.

For tax-filing season 2024, the IRS announced a pilot of &quot;Direct File&quot;, where people can calculate and submit their federal taxes and some state taxes in partnership with select state tax agencies for free. This initiative came as a result of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden.

===Preparation===

TurboTax is the most popular tax preparation software in the United States, holding a 66.6% market share of self-prepared returns in 2018. H&amp;R Block at Home (formerly TaxCut) is the second most popular with a 14% share. Other popular tax software includes: TaxACT at 7%, Tax Hawk (including FreeTaxUSA) at 5.9%, Credit Karma&#x27;s free tax software (now owned by Intuit/TurboTax) at 1.7%, and TaxSlayer at 1.5%.

In some countries, the tax agency provides a prefilled return to streamline the process, but the United States has failed to adopt these technologies as of 2013 after lobbying by tax preparation companies like Intuit. A similar reform was unsuccessfully attempted in California, after a pilot known as ReadyReturn.

==Deadline==
The annual deadline to file one&#x27;s Federal individual income tax return is April 15. The IRS lists scenarios for which Tax Day does not follow this standard deadline - Taxpayers can file an extension where the taxes owed must be paid by April 15 but the completed tax return filed by October 15.

===Proof of timely filing===
==Amended return==
A taxpayer who finds a mistake on a previously filed individual income tax return can file corrections with Form 1040X.

In the United States, taxpayers may file an amended return with the Internal Revenue Service to correct errors reported on a previously paid tax return. Typically a taxpayer does not need to file an amended return if he or she has math errors as the IRS will make the necessary corrections. For individuals, amended returns are filed using Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. In some cases taxpayers may use Form 1045, for example, to carry back a Net Operating Loss to a prior tax period. Form 1045 is generally processed much faster than Form 1040X.

==Privacy and public disclosure==
Tax return laws generally prohibit disclosure of any information gathered on a state tax return. Likewise, the federal government may not (with certain exceptions) disclose tax return information without the filer&#x27;s permission, and each federal agency is also limited in how it can share such information with other federal agencies.

Occasionally there have been efforts in Congress to require tax returns to be open to public inspection. For example, Senators Robert M. La Follette and George W. Norris supported such legislation, applicable to both individual and corporate returns, and public disclosure for wealthy taxpayers was required from 1923 to 1926. Presidential candidates have sometimes voluntarily released their tax returns.

The IRS occasionally has seen &quot;Fifth Amendment&quot; returns from people who accurately report their annual income and tax liability but refuse to reveal the source of the funds on the grounds that such a statement would tend to incriminate the individual.

<text>Tax returns in Canada refer to the obligatory forms that must be submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) each financial year for individuals or corporations earning an income in Canada. The return paperwork reports the sum of the previous year&#x27;s (January to December) taxable income, tax credits, and other information relating to those two items. The return is the method by which the Canadian government determines the appropriate amount of tax that should be paid by individuals and corporations. The result of filing a return with the federal government can result in either a refund (money owed to the person or corporation filing the return), or an amount due to be paid. There is a penalty for not filing a tax return. 

In generalised terms, a tax return refers to the yearly income declaration created by the taxpayer for every individual in the country. This enables tax authorities to declare if an individual is eligible to be given back the tax that they had paid over the year.

Canadian federal tax returns are filed with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Individuals and corporations who reside or conduct business in the province of Quebec also file separate returns with Revenu Québec.

In addition to tax purposes, the return plays a role in voter registration by including a checkbox asking if the signee if they are willing to have their personal contact information included on a national voter registry which is accessible by Elections Canada and its provincial equivalents.

==Who should file a Canadian tax return==
Canadians who live abroad can sometimes continue filing a Canadian tax return, even if they are not required to do so. Three primary factors are used to determine a taxpayer&#x27;s tax residence: dwelling place (or places), spouse or common-law partner and dependants.

==Due date==
Normally, Canadian individual tax returns for any specific year must be filed by April 30 of the &quot;following&quot; year. There is no provision for generally extending this deadline, but there are a few exceptions.

*Tax returns for self-employed individuals and their spouses must be filed by June 15 of the following year. However, any Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax owing for the period is due April 30.
*Tax returns for deceased individuals must be filed by the normal filing deadline or 6 months after the date of death, whichever comes later. Example: Mary dies on January 30, 2004; her 2003 return is due on July 30, 2004 (six months later) and her 2004 return is due on April 30, 2005 (normal filing deadline). This provision is also extended to the surviving spouse.
*Tax returns for non-residents electing to file under section 217 are due June 30 of the following year.
*By virtue of the Interpretation Act the due date of all individual returns is moved to the next business day when the normal due date falls on a Sunday or Holiday. Although ministerial orders are also used to apply this to Saturday due dates, it is not a legal requirement.
*The Federal Finance Minister may extend the deadline in cases of emergency situations such as floods, etc.

==Provincial returns==
Most provinces employ a system of federal-provincial agreements whereby the tax is collected on behalf of a province by the federal government. Quebec is the only province that collects provincial personal income taxes by their agency. Thus, Quebec residents file tax returns with both Revenu Québec and the Canada Revenue Agency. Alberta and Quebec collect their own corporate income tax. Filing deadlines generally match those of the federal government.

== Tax return software and online filing ==
Tax returns can be prepared using various commercial software or online. The returns can be either printed and sent to CRA by mail or submitted to CRA electronically through a government service called NETFILE. Some tax preparation companies allow customers to file tax returns for free.

The biggest tax preparation companies in Canada are H&amp;R Block and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax.

<text>In architecture and structural engineering, a space frame or space structure (3D truss) is a rigid, lightweight, truss-like structure constructed from interlocking struts in a geometric pattern. Space frames can be used to span large areas with few interior supports. Like the truss, a space frame is strong because of the inherent rigidity of the triangle; flexing loads (bending moments) are transmitted as tension and compression loads along the length of each strut.

Chief applications include buildings and vehicles.

==History==
Alexander Graham Bell from 1898 to 1908 developed space frames based on tetrahedral geometry. Bell&#x27;s interest was primarily in using them to make rigid frames for nautical and aeronautical engineering, with the tetrahedral truss being one of his inventions. 

Max Mengeringhausen developed the space grid system called MERO (acronym of &quot;MEngeringhausen ROhrbauweise&quot;) in 1943 in Germany, thus initiating the use of space trusses in architecture. The commonly used method, still in use has individual tubular members connected at node joints (ball shaped) and variations such as the space deck system, octet truss system and cubic system. 

Stéphane de Chateau in France invented the Tridirectional SDC system (1957), Unibat system (1959), Pyramitec (1960). A method of tree supports was developed to replace the individual columns. 

Buckminster Fuller patented the octet truss () in 1961 while focusing on architectural structures. 

Gilman&#x27;s Tetrahedral Truss of 1980 was developed by John J. Gilman; a material scientist known for his work on the molecular matrices of crystalline solids. Gilman was an admirer of Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s architectural trusses, and developed a stronger matrix, in part by rotating an alignment of tetrahedral nodes in relation to each other.

==Design methods==
Space frames are typically designed using a rigidity matrix. The special characteristic of the stiffness matrix in an architectural space frame is the independence of the angular factors. If the joints are sufficiently rigid, the angular deflections can be neglected, simplifying the calculations.

==Overview==

The simplest form of space frame is a horizontal slab of interlocking square pyramids and tetrahedra built from Aluminium or tubular steel struts. In many ways this looks like the horizontal jib of a tower crane repeated many times to make it wider. A stronger form is composed of interlocking tetrahedra in which all the struts have unit length. More technically this is referred to as an isotropic vector matrix or in a single unit width an octet truss. More complex variations change the lengths of the struts to curve the overall structure or may incorporate other geometrical shapes.

==Types==
Within the meaning of space frame, we can find three systems clearly different between them:

Curvature classification

* Space plane covers: These spatial structures are composed of planar substructures. Their behavior is similar to that of a plate in which the deflections in the plane are channeled through the horizontal bars and the shear forces are supported by the diagonals.
* Barrel vaults: This type of vault has a cross section of a simple arch. Usually this type of space frame does not need to use tetrahedral modules or pyramids as a part of its backing. 
* Spherical domes and other compound curves usually require the use of tetrahedral modules or pyramids and additional support from a skin.

Classification by the arrangement of its elements

* Single layer grid: All elements are located on the surface to be approximated.
* Double layer grid: Elements are organized in two layers parallel to each other at a certain distance apart. Each of the layers form a lattice of triangles, squares or hexagons in which the projection of the nodes in a layer may overlap or be displaced relative to each other. Diagonal bars connect the nodes of both layers in different directions in space. In this type of meshes, the elements are associated into three groups: upper cordon, cordon and cordon lower diagonal.
* Triple layer grid: Elements are placed in three parallel layers, linked by the diagonals. They are almost always flat.

Other examples classifiable as space frames are these:

* Pleated metallic structures: Emerged to try to solve the problems that formwork and pouring concrete had their counterparts. Typically run with welded joint, but may raise prefabricated joints, a fact which makes them space meshes.
* Hanging covers: Designs on the cable taut, spine, and the catenary arch (inverted funicular show their ability to channel forces theoretically better than any other alternative, have an infinite range of possibilities for composition and adaptability to any type of plant cover or ensure vain. However, imprecisions in shape having the loaded strand (ideally adapts dynamically to the state of charge) and the risk of bending the arc to unexpected stresses are problems that require pre-compression and pre-stressing elements. Although in most cases tend to be the cheapest and the technical solution that best fits the acoustics and ventilation of the covered enclosure, are vulnerable to vibration.
* Pneumatic structures: Closure membranes subjected to a pressurized state may be considered within this group.

==Applications==
Chief space frame applications include:

Buildings

** Factories
** Warehouses, 
* Commercial, entertainment, and service facilities: 
** Sports halls
** Conference halls, pavilions, and exhibition centers
** Stadiums
** Museums and fair houses

===Construction===
Space frames are a common feature in modern building construction; they are often found in large roof spans in modernist commercial and industrial buildings.

Examples of buildings based on space frames include:
* Stansted Airport, by Foster + Partners
* Bank of China Tower and the Louvre Pyramid, by I. M. Pei
* Rogers Centre by Rod Robbie and Michael Allan
* McCormick Place East in Chicago
*Arena das Dunas in Natal, Brazil by Populous
* Eden Project in Cornwall, England
* Globen, Sweden - Dome with diameter of 110 m, (1989)
* Biosphere 2 by John P. Allen, Phil Hawes, Peter Jon Pearce in Oracle, Arizona
* Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, New York City, New York
*Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain by Arata Isozaki
* Sochi International Airport in Sochi, Russia
* Entrance to Six Flags Magic Mountain
* Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport airport terminal 2
* Harbin Opera House in China by Ma Yansong
* Hedyar Aliyev Centre in Azerbaijan by Zaha Hadid 

Large portable stages and lighting gantries are also frequently built from space frames and octet trusses.

===Vehicles===
==== Aircraft ====
The CAC CA-6 Wackett and Yeoman YA-1 Cropmaster 250R aircraft were built using roughly the same welded steel tube fuselage frame.

Many early “whirlybird”-style exposed-boom helicopters had tubular space frame booms, such as the Bell 47 series.

==== Cars ====
Space frames are sometimes used in the chassis designs of automobiles and motorcycles. In both a space frame and a tube-frame chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have little or no structural function. By contrast, in a unibody or monocoque design, the body serves as part of the structure.

Tube-frame chassis pre-date space frame chassis and are a development of the earlier ladder chassis. The advantage of using tubes rather than the previous open channel sections is that they resist torsional forces better. Some tube chassis were little more than a ladder chassis made with two large diameter tubes, or even a single tube as a backbone chassis. Although many tubular chassis developed additional tubes and were even described as &quot;space frames&quot;, their design was rarely correctly stressed as a space frame and they behaved mechanically as a tube ladder chassis, with additional brackets to support the attached components, suspension, engine etc. The distinction of the true space frame is that all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compression, never bending. Although these additional tubes did carry some extra load, they were rarely diagonalised into a rigid space frame.

An earlier contender for the first true space frame chassis is the one off Chamberlain 8 race &quot;special&quot; built by brothers Bob and Bill Chamberlain in Melbourne, Australia in 1929. Others attribute vehicles produced in the 1930s by designers such as Buckminster Fuller and William Bushnell Stout (the Dymaxion and the Stout Scarab) who understood the theory of the true space frame from either architecture or aircraft design.

A post WW2 attempt to build a racing car space frame was the Cisitalia D46 of 1946. This used two small diameter tubes along each side, but they were spaced apart by vertical smaller tubes, and so were not diagonalised in any plane. A year later, Porsche designed their Type 360 for Cisitalia. As this included diagonal tubes, it can be considered a true space frame and arguable the first mid-rear engined design.

The Maserati Tipo 61 of 1959 (Birdcage) is often thought of as the first but in 1949 Robert Eberan von Eberhorst designed the Jowett Jupiter exhibited at that year&#x27;s London Motor Show; the Jowett went on to take a class win at the 1950 Le Mans 24hr. Later, TVR, the small British car manufacturers developed the concept and produced an alloy-bodied two seater on a multi tubular chassis, which appeared in 1949.

Colin Chapman of Lotus introduced his first &#x27;production&#x27; car, the Mark VI, in 1952. This was influenced by the Jaguar C-Type chassis, another with four tubes of two different diameters, separated by narrower tubes. Chapman reduced the main tube diameter for the lighter Lotus, but did not reduce the minor tubes any further, possibly because he considered that this would appear flimsy to buyers. Although widely described as a space frame, Lotus did not build a true space frame chassis until the Mark VIII, with the influence of other designers, with experience from the aircraft industry.
A large number of kit cars use space frame construction, because manufacture in small quantity requires only simple and inexpensive jigs, and it is relatively easy for an amateur designer to achieve good stiffness with a space frame.

A drawback of the space frame chassis is that it encloses much of the working volume of the car and can make access for both the driver and to the engine difficult. The Mercedes-Benz 300 SL “Gullwing” received its iconic upward-opening doors when its tubular space frame made using regular doors impossible.

Some space frames have been designed with removable sections, joined by bolted pin joints. Such a structure had already been used around the engine of the Lotus Mark III. Although somewhat inconvenient, an advantage of the space frame is that the same lack of bending forces in the tubes that allow it to be modelled as a pin-jointed structure also means that creating such a removable section need not reduce the strength of the assembled frame.
==== Motorcycles and bicycles ====
Italian motorbike manufacturer Ducati extensively uses tube frame chassis on its models.

Space frames have also been used in bicycles, which readily favor stressed triangular sectioning.

<text>Spot is a fictional puppy created by Eric Hill, an English author and illustrator of children&#x27;s picture books. The success of Hill&#x27;s books about Spot led to other media productions, including television and home video titles, music albums, and CD-ROM titles.

==History==
First published in 1980, &quot;Where&#x27;s Spot?&quot; was inspired while Hill was working in creative marketing; he noticed that his three-year-old son was fascinated by the process of lifting up a paper, on a design that he was creating. Captivated by this thought, Hill created a story about a puppy which incorporated the flap design. During the late 1970s, this was an extraordinarily innovative concept, and it took some time for any publisher to take any notice of the idea before Puffin books decided to publish his book. Within weeks of the first book being released it topped the Bestseller list.

Hill said, &quot;When I first drew Spot I realised that when I came to draw the spot on his body and the tip of his tail I was copying the markings on an aircraft. I grew up drawing aircraft – that is how I learned to draw. &quot;I am quite convinced now, as I look back, that the actual training of drawing cartoons – which is, of course, my style – led to my producing Spot. Cartoons must be very simple and have as few words as possible and so must the Spot books. I designed Spot out of my previous background as a designer and illustrator. It was quite unconscious but I can see now that I have created a ready-made trademark of its kind, with the essential spot on the body and a bit on the tail.&quot;

Over time, the book was translated into more than sixty languages. In the Afrikaans version of the book Spot is translated to &quot;Otto&quot;, widely believed to be the surname of a South African friend of Hill&#x27;s. This name has been attributed to Spot, as many of the books were believed to be inspired by the life of aforementioned friend, J. Otto. In the Netherlands, Spot is known as Dribbel.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Spot – The protagonist of the series. A yellow puppy with a brown spot on each side of his body and a brown tip on his tail, Spot appears to be a mixed breed; since his mother is either a beagle, a pointer, a Dalmatian or a St. Bernard and his father is either a Labrador or a golden retriever. Spot is full of curiosity, helpfulness, and a huge desire to learn.
* Sally – Spot&#x27;s mother. She is also yellow and has a brown spot on her back that goes around the back of her body, as well as two brown spots on each side of her body and a brown tip on her tail. Much of the first story, &quot;Where&#x27;s Spot?&quot;, involves her wandering around the house looking for Spot.
* Sam – Spot&#x27;s father. He is also yellow, but without any spots on his body. 
* Susie – Spot&#x27;s little sister, she is yellow but has a brown spot on her back. Like her big brother Spot, Susie also appears to be a mixed breed.
* Helen – A blue hippo who is Spot&#x27;s best friend. She is dark blue and she has sags under her eyes in the first series of &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;. In later episodes of the first series, she is redesigned with a more youthful and less intimidating appearance, and is light blue without the sags under her eyes. Starting with the second series, she becomes a more lighter shade of blue.
* Steve – A brown monkey (possibly a chimpanzee or spider monkey) with a tan face, he is playful, full of surprises and Spot’s second best friend.
* Tom – A green crocodile who is Spot&#x27;s third best friend. In the first series of &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;, he was dark green with white eye sacs, rather sharp-looking incisors and the inside of his mouth was red. Starting with later episodes of the first series, similar to Helen, he was also redesigned with a more youthful and less intimidating appearance, losing the sharp incisors and white eye sacs. In the second series, he is a lighter shade of green. He loves going fishing. Tom also loves playing the drum, considered to be his favourite instrument. His dad is the mayor of the town.
* Ginger – A ginger cat who appears in the books as the family pet.

===Supporting characters===

*Grandma – Spot&#x27;s maternal grandmother and Sally&#x27;s mother. She appears in the book &quot;Spot Visits His Grandparents&quot; and the video &quot;Spot and his Grandparents Go to the Carnival&quot;. 
*Grandpa – Spot&#x27;s maternal grandfather and Sally&#x27;s father. He appears in the book &quot;Spot Visits His Grandparents&quot; and the video &quot;Spot and his Grandparents Go to the Carnival&quot;. 
*Miss Bear – A brown bear who is Spot&#x27;s preschool teacher. She first appeared in &quot;Spot Goes to School&quot;.

===Minor characters===
* Billy – A brown bear who loves to eat. He appears in the first series of &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;. In the books, he appears in &quot;Spot&#x27;s Birthday Party&quot;. 
* Betsy – A brown bear who only appears in &quot;Spot Goes to the Circus&quot;. She is one of the characters who takes Spot&#x27;s ball, and insists its hers when Spot asks for it.
* Clare – A green turtle who is one of Spot&#x27;s classmates and appears in &quot;Spot Goes to School&quot;. She is the only other girl in Spot&#x27;s nursery/preschool class besides Helen. 
* Sybil – An orange cat who is the series&#x27; antagonist. She has a very rude personality, as seen in the episodes &quot;Spot&#x27;s Lost Bone&quot; and &quot;Spot&#x27;s First Walk&quot; as well as the book based on the latter episode. She appears only in the first series of &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;. In the U.S., her rude personality was toned down.
* Mr. Kangaroo –Spot&#x27;s neighbour, a brown kangaroo who speaks in an Australian accent, since kangaroos are a native animal of Australia. He appears only in the first series of &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;.
* Leo – An orange lion.
* Sidney – A yellow-green snake.
* Steve&#x27;s Mom – Steve&#x27;s mother. She appears only in &quot;Spot Sleeps Over&quot;. She is voiced by Linda Gary.
* The Mayor – Tom&#x27;s dad. He appears only in &quot;Spot Goes to the Carnival&quot; and the book from the book series &quot;Spot Goes to School&quot;. He does not speak.

===List of Spot sound books===
In the 1990s, a number of books were released with sound effects, produced by Publications International and published by Frederick Warne. The U.S. edition of the sound books were somewhat different from the UK editions of the book. The text in these editions is slightly altered, and in some cases, the title is changed as well. They are produced and published by Publications International.

===Book design===
The books are set in the typeface Century Schoolbook Infant, a very rare, single-story version of Century Schoolbook.

==Television==
With the success of the books, the BBC commissioned an animated series, which first appeared on 9 April 1987; with Paul Nicholas providing the narration, and re-narrated in 2000 by Jane Horrocks. The series aired on television channel across the world, including RTÉ in Ireland, with the series dubbed into Irish Gaelic with the title &quot;Echtrai Bhrain&quot;. A DVD version was released in Japan in 2005 with Japanese, English and instrumental audio tracks. The DVDs used the same name for Spot as the books in Japan, that being コロちゃん (Korochan). The series aired on Playhouse Disney and CBeebies.

In February 2024, it was announced a new animated series is currently in production from Guru Studio, which marks a revival.

===&quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;: series 1 (1987)===
The first series of &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot;, which was animated and produced by King Rollo Films, aired on the BBC between 9 April and 17 July 1987.

==Direct-to-video specials ==
A number of specials produced for release on VHS were created:

===&quot;It&#x27;s Fun to Learn with Spot&quot; – Phase 1 (1990)===
The first phase of &quot;It&#x27;s Fun to Learn With Spot&quot; was produced by Spitfire Television and Living Doll Productions and released on VHS. It consisted of four episodes, each approximately fifteen minutes in length, and narrated by Peter Hawkins. The theme song used in &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot; was licensed from King Rollo Films, so the familiar tune by Duncan Lamont was heard at the beginning and end of each episode. However, music on the show was kept to a minimum.
# &quot;Spot&#x27;s Alphabet&quot; 
# &quot;Spot&#x27;s Busy Year&quot;
# &quot;Spot Learns to Count&quot; 
# &quot;Spot Tells the Time&quot;

===&quot;It&#x27;s Fun to Learn with Spot&quot; – Phase 2 (1994)===
The second phase of &quot;It&#x27;s Fun to Learn With Spot&quot;, like the first VHS, consisted of four fifteen-minute episodes. However the episodes were produced by King Rollo Films and retained the talents of Paul Nicholas and Duncan Lamont in the UK.

&quot;Episodes in this series:&quot;
# &quot;Spot Looks at Opposites&quot; 
# &quot;Spot&#x27;s First Word Game&quot; 
# &quot;Spot Looks at Colours&quot; 
# &quot;Spot Looks at Shapes&quot;

Note: The two phases of &quot;It&#x27;s Fun to Learn with Spot&quot; are often listed as one series, even on Penguin Television&#x27;s website. However, as noted, the two phases were produced four years apart by two different companies and are very different in design.

Spot&#x27;s Magical Christmas was released in 1995 and Spot and his Grandparents Go to the Carnival in 1997. These two specials, which are both thirty minutes long, have some notable differences from the normal series. First off, they have no narration, and each character is voiced distinctly. The characters&#x27; mouths also move to speech, in comparison to the other episodes, in which the characters&#x27; mouths remain static and the entire episode is narrated as a story. There are also several songs in the specials, as there were in &quot;It&#x27;s Fun to Learn With Spot&quot;.

Voices
*Calum Neilsen – Spot (Spot&#x27;s Magical Christmas)
*Tom Fletcher – Spot (Spot and his Grandparents Go to the Carnival)
*Josie Lawrence – Sally/Helen
*Paul Nicholas – Sam (Spot&#x27;s Magical Christmas)
*Philip Pope – Tom
*Steve Steen – Sam (Spot and his Grandparents Go to the Carnival)/Steve
*Steve Frost – Reindeer #1
*Lee Cornes – Reindeer #2
*Andy Paresi – Santa Claus
*Carol MacReady – Grandma
*Rob Inglis – Grandpa

===American cast===
From 1989 to 2002, The Disney Channel aired the two &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot; series as part of its half-hour &quot;Lunch Box&quot; series, and later as post-show interstitials. For the program&#x27;s home video releases in the United States, Walt Disney Home Video re-dubbed the series with character voices rather than a singular narrator. The Disney Channel also aired the two re-dubbed specials but continued to air &quot;The Adventures of Spot&quot; in its original British version.

*Corey Burton – Narrator, Sam, Tom, Steve, Spot&#x27;s Grandpa, additional voices
*Linda Gary (until 1995) – Sally, Miss Bear, Betsy, Helen, Clare, Tina, Sybil, additional voices
*Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Ryan O&#x27;Donohue and Haley Joel Osment – Spot 
*Shaun Fleming – Spot (singing voice)
*Tress MacNeille (since 1995) – Helen, Sally, Female Reindeer, Spot&#x27;s Grandma, additional voices
*Jim Cummings – Male Reindeer, Santa Claus

==Other media==
===Music albums===
A number of companies have released a number of CDs featuring mainly nursery rhymes, under the name of &quot;The Spot&quot;.

* Spot in the Park with the Flowerpot Gang – Released in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in the early 2000s, this CD consists of 26 nursery rhymes. Apparently, it is now out of print.
* Spot&#x27;s First Play Songs – Published by Genius Entertainment, this CD is also available in a box set titled &quot;Spot&#x27;s Favorite Toddler Tunes&quot; (although in this edition, The Alphabet Song is excluded).
* Spot&#x27;s Farmyard Friends – This CD has also been published by Genius Entertainment and is also available in the &quot;Spot&#x27;s Favorite Toddler Tunes&quot; box set.
* Spot&#x27;s Classics for Growing Minds – Jumping on the success of the controversial Mozart Effect, this CD contains twelve classical numbers from various classical composers. Also published by Genius Entertainment, this album was also included in the &quot;Spot&#x27;s Favorite Toddler Tunes&quot; box set.

<text>Autodesk Alias (formerly known as Alias StudioTools) is a family of computer-aided industrial design (CAID) software predominantly used in automotive design and industrial design for generating class A surfaces using Bézier surface and non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) modeling method.

The product is sold specifically as CAID rather than CAD, and its tools and abilities are oriented more towards the &quot;styling&quot; aspect of design - that is to say, the product&#x27;s housing and outer appearance. It does not go into mechanical detail like other CAD programs such as Siemens NX, Inventor, CATIA, Creo and SolidWorks.

==History==

===Alias Research===

Alias software was developed by four computer scientists: Stephen Bingham, Nigel McGrath, Susan McKenna and David Springer to create an easy-to-use software package to produce realistic 3D models.

In 1983, Alias Research was founded at Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Alias unveiled its first product Alias/1 in 1985 at SIGGRAPH &#x27;85 in San Francisco.

Initial versions ran only on Silicon Graphics computers and the Irix operating system, until late in the 1990s when the software was ported to Microsoft Windows. In 2011 Mac versions were launched, which were discontinued in 2019. The company was a leader in high-end 3D graphics software.

In 1995, Alias Research was purchased by Silicon Graphics and merged Wavefront Technologies, another 3D software graphics company founded in 1984 at Santa Barbara, California, to form Alias/Wavefront which was later renamed as Alias Systems Corporation.

===Under Autodesk===

On October 4, 2005 Alias was acquired by Autodesk, StudioTools changed its name to Autodesk AliasStudio. It became part of Autodesk in 2006.

==Products==
The product suite starts with Alias Design as the entry-level conceptual design system, progressing to Alias Surface, and then to Alias Automotive as the top-of-the-line product with all of the options.

Tools for sketching, modeling and visualization are combined in one software package. It meets the specialized needs of designers: sketching, freedom to experiment with shape and form, creating organic shapes, visualization for design review, and data exchange with CAD packages.

As of version 2021, Autodesk Alias was split into separate standalone products:
* Autodesk Alias AutoStudio (formerly Autodesk Alias Automotive)
* Autodesk Alias Surface (formerly Autodesk Surface Studio)
* Autodesk Alias Concept ( formerly Autodesk Design Studio)

== Usage and application ==

Autodesk Alias is often used for design and styling in the automotive, marine, aircraft, sporting equipment, packaging electronic enclosure, children&#x27;s toy, and fashion accessory markets.

Alias .wire data reads directly into Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Showcase, Autodesk ImageStudio, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk VRED and It exports into several other 3D engineering packages via IGES or STEP such as Siemens NX, SolidWorks, Creo and CATIA for further downstream detailing and operations.

The program has two types of modelers within it: NURBS and Subdivision.

<doc id="514196" wikidata="Q28527" url="?curid=514196" title="Machair">
<text>A machair (; sometimes machar in English) is a fertile low-lying grassy plain found on part of the northwest coastlines of Ireland and Scotland, in particular the Outer Hebrides. The best examples are found on North and South Uist, Harris and Lewis.

==Etymology==
&quot;Machair&quot; is a Gaelic word meaning &quot;fertile plain&quot;, but the word is now also used in scientific literature to describe the dune grassland unique to Western Scotland and north-west Ireland. It had been used by naturalists since 1926, but the term was not adopted by scientists until the 1940s. The word is used in a number of Irish, Scottish and Manx placenames to refer to low-lying fertile ground or fields, even in areas where no machair has ever been supported. In Scotland, some Gaelic speakers use &quot;machair&quot; as a general term for the whole dune system, including the dune ridge, while others restrict its use to the extensive flat grasslands inland of the dune ridge. In Ireland, the word has been used only in place-names, and the habitat&#x27;s existence there was only
recently confirmed. In Manx Gaelic, &#x27;magher&#x27; is a common term for a field.

In 1976, an effort was made to strictly define &quot;machair&quot;, although a number of systems still evade classification. This proved difficult when the habitat was listed on Annex I of the Habitats Directive in 1992, leading to the distinction between &quot;machair grassland&quot; and the &quot;machair system&quot;.

==Geography==

Machair is distinguished from the links on the east coast of Scotland by a lower mineral content, whereas the links are high in silica. Machair plains are highly calcareous, with calcium carbonate concentrations of between 20% and 80% on the beaches, and decreasing further away from the shore. The pH of a machair is typically greater than 7, i.e. it is alkaline.

The inner side of a machair is often wet or marshy, and may contain lochs.

===Formation===
The modern theory of machair formation was first set out by William MacGillivray in 1830. He worked out that shell fragments are rolled by waves towards the shore, where they are broken up further. The small shell fragments are blown up the beach to form hillocks, which are then blown inland.

===Humans===
Human activity has an important role in the creation of the machair. Archaeological evidence indicates that some trees had been cleared for agriculture by around 6000 BC, but there was still some woodland on the coast of South Uist as late as 1549. Seaweed deposited by early farmers provided a protective cover and added nutrients to the soil. The grass is kept short by cattle and sheep, which also add trample and add texture to the sward, forming tussocks that favour a number of bird species.

The soil is low in a number of key nutrients, including trace elements such as copper, cobalt and manganese, which makes it necessary to feed cattle supplements or take them to summer pastures elsewhere. The sandy soil does not hold nutrients well, making artificial fertilisers ineffective and limiting the crops that can be grown to certain strains of oats and rye, and bere barley.

==Ecology==
Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.

===Sea===
Kelp in the sea next to the machair softens the impact of waves, reducing erosion, and when it is washed ashore by storms, forms a protective barrier on the beach. As the kelp decays it provides home to local sand flies which in turn provide rich feeding for flocks of starlings and other passerines, wintering waders, gulls and others. If covered with sand, kelp will compost to form a fertile bed where annual coastal flowers and marram grass will thrive.

===Flora===

They can house rare carpet flowers, including orchids such as Irish lady&#x27;s tresses and the Hebridean spotted orchid and other plants such as the yellow rattle.

===Fauna===
Bird species including the corn crake, twite, dunlin, common redshank and ringed plover, as well as rare insects such as the northern colletes bee, the great yellow bumblebee (&quot;Bombus distinguendus&quot;) and the moss carder bee (&quot;Bombus muscorum&quot;), are found there.

===Threats===
Arable and fallow machair is threatened by changes to the way the land is managed, where the original system of crofts is under threat from a reduction in the number of crofters and the use of &quot;modern&quot; techniques. Changes to the Common Agricultural Policy, where production was decoupled from subsidies, reduced the amount of grazing taking place in many crofting areas, and led some areas to be undergrazed or abandoned. A lack of native seed increases the need for fertilizers and herbicides.

Rising sea levels caused by global warming also pose a threat to low-lying coastal areas, leading to increased erosion. In January 1993, the storm which ran MV &quot;Braer&quot; aground off Shetland eroded of machair along the entire length of Uist and Barra. On 11/12 January
2005, a storm blowing consistently in excess of hurricane force 12 destroyed hectares of machair.

<text>The State University of Campinas (), commonly called Unicamp, is a public research university in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

Established in 1962, Unicamp was designed from scratch as an integrated research center unlike other top Brazilian universities, usually created by the consolidation of previously existing schools and institutes. Its research focus reflects on almost half of its students being graduate students, the largest proportion across all large universities in Brazil, and also in the large number of graduate programs it offers: 153 compared to 70 undergraduate programs. It also offers several non-degree granting open-enrollment courses to around 8,000 students through its extension school.

Its main campus occupies located in the district of Barão Geraldo, a suburban area from the downtown center of Campinas, built shortly after the creation of the university. It also has satellite campuses in Limeira, Piracicaba and Paulínia, and manages two technical high schools located in Campinas and Limeira. Funding is provided almost entirely by the state government and, like other Brazilian public universities, no tuition fees or administrative fees are charged for undergraduate and graduate programs.

Unicamp is responsible for around 15% of Brazilian research, a disproportionately high number when compared to much larger and older institutions in the country such as the University of São Paulo. It also produces more patents than any other research organization in Brazil, being second only to the state-owned oil company, Petrobras. 

== History ==

=== 1960s: Foundation ===

In the early 1960s the Government of the State of São Paulo planned to open a new research center in the interior of the state to promote development and industrialization in the region, and commissioned Zeferino Vaz, founder of the University of São Paulo&#x27;s School of Medicine in Ribeirão Preto, to organize it. In parallel, a medical school was being planned in Campinas, a demand from the local population that dated from the early 1940s. The School of Medicine of Campinas was created by law in 1959, but actual implementation never took place.

The new university was created by law on December 28, 1962, but effective functioning begun in 1966. Before that, only the School of Medicine functioned. In April 1963 the first vestibular, the general admissions exam, was conducted, with 1,592 candidates competing for 50 spots in the medicine program. The first lecture in the newly created University of Campinas took place on May 20 of the same year. By 1965, the organizing commission for the new university started looking for a location for a new campus.
A large area comprising was donated by the Almeida Prado family, located in a valley in the district of Barão Geraldo in the city of Campinas, near the intersections of multiple highways. Until then, Barão Geraldo was a small village surrounded by farmland, in particular sugar cane plantations. The new development brought dramatic change to the district, resulting in entire new neighborhoods being zoned, planned and built, usually by the same Almeida Prado family.
Work on the new campus began on October 5, 1966, and the first building completed was the Institute of Biology, followed by administrative buildings. In the same year, Zeferino Vaz was nominated the rector. In parallel to the new campus, new units were opened in other cities, absorbing local schools. The Dental School of Piracicaba was absorbed in 1967, and in 1969 the Engineering School of Limeira.

=== 1970–1990: Growth and crisis ===
Over the following two decades, the new university expanded rapidly. The campus quickly grew to 19 institutes and schools, and after Zeferino Vaz died in 1981 was named after him. With the campus construction completed, the School of Medical Sciences (formerly the School of Medicine of Campinas) was moved into the new campus, and its teaching hospital, Hospital de Clínicas, became the largest public hospital in the region.

Expansion on the campus continued rapidly, with new buildings, institutes and expansions being added nearly every year. However, by the late 1970s, the university faced a crisis. During its rapid expansion, it relied on draft bylaws, mostly borrowed from the University of São Paulo, and lacked formal internal regulations with the aging Zeferino Vaz, while no longer the rector, acting as a moderating force between parties with conflicting interests, in particular the leftist academic community and the State&#x27;s government, appointed by the conservative military regime ruling the country.

After Zeferino&#x27;s death in 1981, a conflict took place between the university&#x27;s General Coordinator, appointed and backed by the government, and the Directive Council, composed of directors of different institutes. The rector introduced new rules reducing the power of the General Coordinator. As retaliation, the State&#x27;s government removed 6 members of the Directive Council, replacing them with people from the state&#x27;s Education Council, loyal to the governor, Paulo Maluf.Tensions between the academic community and the government-appointed counselors increased, with the future Minister of Education, Paulo Renato Costa Souza, then president of the Faculty Association, classifying the episode as a &quot;white intervention&quot;. Following the dismissal of several institute heads and members of the administration, the administrative workers went on strike, with the support of students and faculty. With activities in the university frozen by the strike, the governor declared a formal intervention in the university in October 1981.

Despite the police-backed intervention, the university continued on strike. The appointed institute heads failed to break the stalemate between internal and external forces, and by early 1982, discussions began on a new list of candidates to the rectorship. Eventually, José Aristodemo Pinotti, a former dean of the School of Medical Sciences generally considered a moderate, was selected by the academic community and accepted by the governor. In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was lifted, and academic activities resumed normally.

After the crisis, Unicamp saw a period of renewal and restructuring. In 1983 the bylaws were rewritten, ensuring the autonomy of the academic community, and the new management structure for the campus was implemented. In 1986 the newly created University Council replaces the previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. The last years of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.

=== 1990 onwards ===

With a new administrative structure capable of supporting continuous growth and with its autonomy secured, Unicamp went through a period of consolidation in the 1990s. There was an increase in night programs, created to provide an alternative for low-income students who had to work during the day, and to increase utilization of classrooms and the existing infrastructure, reaching one third of total available places.

The period also saw an expansion of the technology industry in the region, centered around Unicamp, with Motorola, IBM, Solectron, Lucent Technologies and many others set up research labs and production centers in the region driven by the large number of highly qualified students graduating every year, culminating in the opening of the Institute of Computing in 1996.

In the 2000s Unicamp consolidated itself as one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also brought new challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the total budget) constrain investment and expansion. This is further aggravated by the economic depression that Brazil has been facing since 2014, the largest in the country&#x27;s history.

== Campus ==

=== Main campus ===

The flagship campus of the University of Campinas is located in the district of Barão Geraldo, from the center of Campinas. It currently occupies an area of situated in a valley surrounded by gentle rolling hills and is bounded on the west by the urban area of Barão Geraldo, on the south and east by farmland and to the north by a lake and a new industrial park built in the 2000s.

==== Design ====
The campus has a unique design, with the main library, student service buildings and restaurant in a central circular plaza, and most of the academic buildings located in blocks emanating from the center in a radial fashion. The different areas of study are grouped in larger sections, but neighboring other areas with which they share similarities: the philosophy buildings mark the frontier between human sciences, mathematics and economics, while the School of Food Engineering is bordered by the chemical engineering and biology buildings. The architect responsible for the overall design of the campus was João Carlos Bross.

Streets are named after significant contributors to each field, including Elis Regina and Carlos Gomes Streets, a Brazilian singer and a composer, respectively, Alan Turing Avenue and others.

==== History ====
The area occupied by the campus was part of the much larger Rio das Pedras farm, owned by the prominent Almeida Prado family. In order to establish a new campus, Zeferino Vaz was looking for a large, flat area in the outskirts of the city, where he would have the freedom to design the campus and its surroundings from scratch. Interested in developing the area of the farm around Barão Geraldo, the family donated an initial area of to the university. The remainder of the farmland was eventually zoned and developed into multiple neighborhoods, but the main historical farmhouse and its surroundings remain, now a protected heritage site and a natural reserve.

With the land secured, the campus was designed in a way to ensure the maximum collaboration between the different sciences, with buildings laid along radial streets emanating from a central circular plaza, which also hosted administrative buildings. The layout of the campus would eventually be used on the design of the university&#x27;s logo, created by Max Schiefer, which is essentially a simplified map of the core circle of the campus. This design is similar to the University of California, Irvine campus, build around the same time.

Construction started in 1966, with General Castello Branco, the first president of Brazil&#x27;s military regime, laying the cornerstone of the Institute of Biology, which was inaugurated in 1968, and classes started in the new campus on the following year. In 1971 the area of the campus was expanded by , more than doubling its size, to accommodate the move of the School of Medical Sciences, until then located across several buildings in Campinas, to the new campus. This expansion saw the construction of a massive public hospital, the Hospital das Clínicas (HC), which began serving the public in 1979.

While initial construction was considered complete by 1978, the campus has grown through continuous addition of new buildings and institutes. In 2014, after years of negotiation, the university decided to buy the Argentina Farm, located on the east side of the campus, increasing the total area by 60% to . This purchase will allow for expansion of the medical sciences and athletics areas, as well as new laboratories.

==== Medical center ====

Unicamp&#x27;s main campus houses the School of Medical Sciences&#x27; teaching hospital, the Hospital das Clinicas. Construction started in 1975 and the hospital opened its first clinics and patient facilities in 1979, but was only fully operational in 1985, when the School of Medical Sciences was transferred from Campinas&#x27; maternity to the new campus.

The hospital has almost 1,000 beds, and serves half a million people every year through Brazil&#x27;s unified public health system, SUS, performing on average 40 surgeries and 13 births every day. In the 2000s, the hospital was changed from a primary and secondary care to a specialized tertiary care center, receiving complex cases from other hospitals and clinics in the region, but around 60% of patients in the hospital are still cases that could be handled by local health centers.

The hospital directly employs 3,100 people, and also serves as a practice center for the university&#x27;s faculty and a training and residency center for the students of medicine, nursery and speech therapy.

==== Synchrotron lab ====
While not part of Unicamp, the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) is a research institution focused on physics, structural biology and nanotechnology that maintains close ties with the university and is operated as part of the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM). The laboratory was designed in 1983 and began operating in 1997, located next to the main campus. The LNLS has Latin America&#x27;s only particle accelerator, a synchrotron, used as a synchrotron light source designed and built in Brazil for various physical, chemical, geological, and biological studies.

=== Limeira ===

Unicamp&#x27;s presence in Limeira, a city about from Campinas, dates from the late 1960s, when the young university absorbed the Engineering School of Limeira, which became the School of Civil Engineering. The UNICAMP began offering technology courses in 1974 with the creation of a Sanitary Technology course. The course was designed to be taught during the day with the finish at least two years, in old installations of Faculty of Civil Engineering (FEC) in the city of Limeira. Later, in 1976 was created the course of Construction Technology, with specification in Building or Construction Methods of Soil. While this school was eventually transferred to the Campinas campus in 1989, new programs were launched by the university in Limeira, creating CESET, the School of Technology of Limeira, which still exists and is located near the center of the city, focused on technical higher education.
In 2008 Unicamp decided to establish a new campus in Limeira, and in 2008 the School of Applied Sciences was created, offering programs such as public administration, business management, nutrition and industrial engineering. The total undergraduate class size for the new campus is 480 students per year.

=== Piracicaba ===
In 1967 Unicamp absorbed the School of Odontology of Piracicaba, founded in 1955 and located northwest of the main campus in Campinas. With over 1,000 students, the school was initially located in a historic building near the center of the city, and in the 1970s a new campus was built, occupying an area of in what was then the outskirts of the city, and a short distance from USP&#x27;s ESALQ.

=== Paulínia ===
In the neighboring city of Paulínia, the university operates a multidisciplinary research center focused on biosciences, acquired in 1986 from Monsanto and integrated into the university as CPQBA. As part of the acquisition, Unicamp gained access and continued research into subjects previously explored at the center, specially agricultural sciences. Research is usually funded by external parties, such as companies and other universities.

=== COTUCA and COTIL ===
In addition to the higher education programs, Unicamp is also responsible for running and funding two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL). Cotuca was located for 50 years in a historical building near the center of the city built in 1918 which also housed Unicamp for a brief period before the current campus was built. In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the old building went through renovations. Both schools are amongst the best public high schools in the country, and are highly competitive, with admissions done through a selection exam open to middle-school students.

== Organization and administration ==
Similarly to other Brazilian institutions, Unicamp is composed of several semi-autonomous teaching units, designated as schools and institutes. Each unit is headed by a director from the faculty, equivalent to a dean, elected by the faculty and student representatives.

The university&#x27;s administration is structured in a way similar to other public universities in Brazil. The supreme decision body is the University Council (CONSU), composed of all deans, plus several representatives from the academic community, students, administrative staff and the external community. The council meets roughly 4 to 5 times per year, ruling on high level administrative decisions such as approving the budget and has the final word in internal administrative processes. Routine administration is left to the rector, similar to a university chancellor in English-speaking countries, and the rectorate.

=== Rectors ===

The rector is chosen by the governor of the State of São Paulo from a list of 3 candidates elected by the university&#x27;s community, including students and administrative staff. Traditionally, the governor always selects the candidate with the largest number of votes, but it retains the power to choose a different one should it decide to do so. The rector serves for a term of 4 years before a new election is held, and can not be reelected in the following term. Zeferino Vaz was the first rector and held the position for 12 years until his mandatory retirement.

=== Schools and institutes ===

Unicamp is composed of a total of 24 units, 10 of which are institutes and 14 are schools. The university is also home to 22 interdisciplinary centers which conduct research and outreach on topics ranging from dance (such as LUME) to computing and education (such as NIED).

Unicamp is also responsible for two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL).

=== Funding &amp; financial information ===
Like other public universities in Brazil, Unicamp is almost entirely funded by the government, in this particular case of the State of São Paulo. Funding is provided mainly from sales taxes, but a small percentage of total budget is obtained from donations, paid extension programs and corporate sponsors.

The total budget proposed for 2016 is of R$2.3 billion, a decrease by almost 7% in real terms when compare to 2015. Fixed costs (payroll, interest and debt service) will account for 92.2% of the government funding. And additional 4% is spent on student assistance and 2% on utilities.

A problem faced by Unicamp, and other public universities in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, while most of the expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation as a response to the annual strikes led by the workers&#x27; union, STU.

== Academics ==
At Unicamp, academic studies are usually divided into four main areas: exact sciences (which includes formal and physical sciences), human sciences (roughly equivalent to social science, including Arts), biological sciences (roughly equivalent to life sciences) and technologies (including engineering and technical studies). This division reflects on how the university are structured how the campuses was designed.

=== Undergraduate programs ===

Unicamp offers 70 different degree-granting undergraduate programs, covering nearly all different areas of science. Completing an undergraduate program grants either a bachelor&#x27;s degree or a licentiate degree, although some programs offer both degrees. In line with the Brazilian educational system, no graduate education is required to practice any profession, including law and medicine, so undergraduate programs vary in length to provide all the necessary training. Most programs at Unicamp last a total of 4 years, with engineering programs typically lasting 5 years and medicine lasting 6 years.

The academic year is aligned with the calendar year, with classes usually starting in late February, and ending in early December, the beginning of summer in Brazil. The year is divided into two semester terms, and all courses are a semester long. While there is a suggested curriculum for each program, students are free to choose any classes to attend during a specific semester, and class attribution is done in the basis of grade average, with higher-graded students having priority when choosing classes.

Students are admitted to a single program and are expected to take all the classes required to complete that program in the number of semesters prescribed, although they can take 50% longer before facing administrative measures. While each program is usually managed by a single school or institute (exceptions apply, such as Computer Engineering, co-managed by the Institute of Computing and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering), classes are usually ministered across different institutes or schools.

Program class sizes usually range between 30 and 60 students per year for each program, but some programs can have over 100 students per year, and are named by the year of admission: the class of 2015 is composed of all students entering in the year of 2015, regardless of the program length or expected graduation. There is no campus-wide graduation ceremony, with each school or institute conducting its own.

=== Graduate programs ===
Unicamp offers 153 postgraduate programs, with about half of those being masters, serving almost 16 thousand students, one third of which come from outside the State of São Paulo, and around 5% are international students. Just as with undergraduate studies, students pay no tuition fees. While the programs are coordinated by the rectorship, the individual institutions have a lot of freedom on defining the focus, length and admission process of each program.

=== Extension programs and community outreach ===

Unicamp offers over one thousand extension programs to the community, with different levels of minimum requirements (high school degree, undergraduate degree, etc.) and across all areas of study, focusing mainly on specialization courses and community outreach. The programs are mainly coordinated by the Pro-Rectorate for Extension and Outreach (&quot;Pró-Reitoria de Extensão e Assuntos Comunitários,&quot; PREAC). PREAC aims to promote actions of extension and culture through integration with society, disseminating and acquiring knowledge through the academic community.

Specialization programs are either offered by Unicamp&#x27;s extension school, Extecamp, or directly by the schools and institutes. In the past 25 years, over 100,000 students have been reached and in 2014, Unicamp joined Coursera and currently eight online courses are being offered, two of them are between the most popular Coursera courses in Brazil. Outreach actions take a variety of forms, including events, publications, technological, educational, cultural and social products and services. The Department for Cultural Development hosts several events, usually open for the surrounding community. Events are also held at the Casa do Lago Cultural Space and at the Cultural Center for Social Inclusion and Integration.

Every year, Unicamp also hosts an open doors event (&quot;Unicamp de Portas Abertas&quot;, UPA), in which the main campus is visited by over 50 thousand high school students from across the country. The event provides presentations and discussions on the role of the university in the society, as well as career presentations and tours, with the students visiting several areas of the university and gaining a better understanding of the different areas of study.

=== Faculty ===
Unicamp employs close to 1,800 professors, nearly all with at least a doctoral degree. The faculty career is structured in three major tiers:
* Doctor Professor (&quot;Professor Doutor&quot;, equivalent to assistant professor): candidates must have a doctoral or equivalent degree
* Associate Professor (&quot;Professor Associado&quot;): candidates must have a &quot;Livre Docente&quot; title, similar to the German Habilitation
* Tenured Professor (&quot;Professor Titular&quot;) – MS-6 (top rank, only MS-6 professors are allowed to hold positions such as Dean of a Faculty/School or Rector of the university)
Hiring is done through a civil service examination, including a written test, a teaching examination, academic history analysis and other additional criteria. The same process is required for professors changing tiers: an associate professor pursuing a tenure position must go through the same examination process compete with other external candidates for the position. The two initial tiers also include sub levels, and professors are promoted between them for merit. Monthly starting salary for a full-time assistant professorship is around R$ 10 thousand, and for a tenured position around R$15 thousand. Uniquely among public universities in Brazil, Unicamp has a career focused on full-time research. Currently there are approximately 100 full-time researchers at the university.

=== Library system ===
The university&#x27;s library system (&quot;Sistema de Bibliotecas da Unicamp&quot;; SBU) comprises a large central library named in honor of César Lattes, and 27 other satellite libraries, located in the individual institutions, housing over 1 million volumes, in addition to hundreds of thousands of ebooks and academic journals. The system was officially created in 1983, aggregating the several independent libraries that operated across the university. The large central library was inaugurated six years later, in 1989.

The library system is automated and its collections may be accessed and searched on the Internet. Its Digital Library section supports a database with more than 25,000 dissertations presented in the university, as well access to the largest electronic libraries of academic journals in the world. It also includes several historical libraries and media archives focused on specific authors and topics, such as the Edgard Leuenroth Archive and collections honoring César Lattes, Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, Monteiro Lobato and others.

== Admissions ==

=== Undergraduate programs ===
Similarly to other Brazilian public universities, admissions to undergraduate programs are through a comprehensive general examination, called vestibular. While other Brazilian public universities, specially federally managed ones, which use the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese &quot;Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio&quot;) as an entrance exam, Unicamp has its own national entrance exam applied yearly by its Vestibular Commission (COMVEST, in Portuguese &quot;Comissão Permanente para os Vestibulares&quot;) in two rounds. Generally, the first round happens in November and is a test composed of 90 multiple-choice general knowledge questions. Students applying to programs that require specific skills (such as music, architecture, dance, and others) must take a specific knowledge test even before the first phase.

Selection in the admissions process is program-specific. Applicants that score a minimum standardized grade in the first round are selected to participate in the second round, which takes place over three days in January, where they must answer 48 short-answer written questions, plus write two long-form essays, on themes selected by the evaluation board.

The Unicamp national exam is very competitive and is considered one of the most difficult in Brazil. In 2015 there were 77,145 applications for only 3,320 possible places, with 23 candidates competing for each position in an undergraduate program, an average acceptance rate of 4.3%. The exam covers all topics taught in the Brazilian high school system, including Portuguese, mathematics, Brazilian and world history, geography, biology, physics, chemistry, sociology, philosophy, arts and English. Despite that, questions in the exams are generally interdisciplinary.

The most competitive undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many students to take preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. It is common to find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering and other programs after several years of preparatory courses.

While the selection process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion and Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese &quot;Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social&quot;) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has increased the number of admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% of admissions come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.

=== Graduate programs ===
Unlike undergrad admissions, there is no single admission process for graduate students. Each institution inside Unicamp has its own set of procedures, which usually include an admissions exam which can be specific for Unicamp or a standard exam applied across the country (such as ANPEC (in Portuguese) for economics, and PosComp (in Portuguese) for computer science. Besides the exam, the process usually includes an academic history analysis, interviews and in many cases requires a submission of a research project to be undertaken during the graduate studies.

== Student life ==
=== Housing ===
Similarly to other Brazilian universities, Unicamp offers no large-scale in-campus housing, and most students live either near the campus or in Campinas. A student tradition in Brazil, inherited from the Portuguese universities, is the &quot;república&quot;, a fraternity-style private housing where multiple students rent large houses or apartments and live together. Dues to the suburban campus and the large number of students coming from other cities, &quot;repúblicas&quot; play a key role in the student life, serving as centers for social life, parties and also study and work areas. While some &quot;repúlicas&quot; have existed for decades, sometimes moving from one house to another, most are formed by students in the same or similar classes, and last for a few years.

Besides &quot;repúblicas&quot;, studio apartments are very common around the university. While more expensive than the shared houses, they afford more privacy and have more flexible contracts, are well as being furnished.

==== University housing ====
Unicamp provides a limited amount of free housing to low income students in the Student Residence compound. Built in 1992, it is located near the center of Barão Geraldo, about four kilometers from Unicamp, and is served by a university shuttle that takes student to the campus and back free of charge. The compound has 226 houses of , with a capacity of four students per house, and 27 studios of , for couples with children, a total of 904 vacancies in houses and 54 adults in the studios. Assignment criterion is means-based, with lower income students receiving priority.

The Student Residence supports several cultural projects developed by voluntary and worker students and open to the participation of internal and external community. It encourages interdisciplinary training and integration between the resident students and the external community. The diversity of races and cultures, brought by colleagues from other states and countries is an advantage for the residents who live in the house, facilitating full citizenship, through the exercise of their rights and duties within the community.

=== University restaurants ===
There are multiple restaurants operated and subsidized by the university serving only the academic community. Commonly called &quot;bandejão&quot; (&quot;large tray&quot; in Portuguese) due to the metal trays used to serve the students, the restaurants provide up to three meals per day, the breakfast costing R$2 for students and lunch and dinner costing R$3, a price that has only been updated once in over a decade, despite the strong inflation. The main &quot;bandejão&quot; is located near the center of the circular campus, receiving students from all different areas of the university and acting as the informal social heart of the university where events, parties and political campaigns are announced to the students.

The restaurants at the university are staffed with nutritionists and food engineers, often students at the university, offering balanced menu that meets the nutritional needs of the university population, serving over 10 thousand meals per day at the main campus. The menu usually consists of rice and beans, a traditional staple food in Brazil, a type of meat (chicken, beef, sausage, pork, etc.), textured soy protein for vegetarians, salad, juice, and dessert.

There are three such restaurants in the main campus, with two additional restaurants located in the Limeira and Piracicaba campuses. In all of them access is restricted to those who have a university-issued smart card ID, which is also used to pay for the food. In addition to the subsidized restaurants, there are several smaller, privately ran restaurants across the campus and many more located in Barão Geraldo, often just a short walk away from the campus.

=== Athletics ===
There are no university-sponsored athletic programs at Unicamp, and sporting competitions, either internal or played with other schools, are entirely organized by the students. The &quot;Liga das Atléticas da Unicamp&quot;, a university-wide league of the different athletic associations, is responsible for organizing internal sporting events, such as the Unicamp Olympics.

In addition to internal competitions, there are multiple external competitions between several universities focused on different areas of study: in the &quot;Intermed&quot; medical students from different universities compete against each other, and in the &quot;Engenharíadas,&quot; engineering students gather to play sports. The games are usually held in the city of one of the participating universities over a long weekend, with students being housed in public schools, farms and hotels.

The university has a sports center with courts for basketball, volleyball, a full size regulation football field, an athletics field with running tracks, a competition swimming pool, a covered gymnasium for indoor spectator sports, attached to a convention center.

== In popular culture ==

=== Varginha incident ===
Unicamp is generally regarded by the Brazilian population as Brazil&#x27;s Area 51, with the government running a secret underground area purportedly called Pavilion 18, located under the Institute of Chemistry. In 1996 there were reports of an extraterrestrial sighting in the city of Varginha, commonly called the Varginha Incident, followed by additional reports of military intervention in the region and that the extraterrestrial would have been taken to the secret Pavilion 18 area at Unicamp.

<text>The Okavango River (formerly spelt Okovango or Okovanggo), is a river in southwest Africa. It is known by this name in Botswana, and as Cubango in Angola, and Kavango in Namibia. It is the fourth-longest river system in southern Africa, running southeastward for . It begins at an elevation of in the sandy highlands of Angola. Farther south, it forms part of the border between Angola and Namibia, and then flows into Botswana. The Okavango does not have an outlet to the sea. Instead, it discharges into the Okavango Delta or Okavango Alluvial Fan, in an endorheic basin in the Kalahari Desert. The Cuito River is a major tributary.

== Flow ==

The Cubango and Cuito Rivers are the principal tributaries of the Okavango Delta, and affect its health. In Angola, the upper reaches of the Cuito suffers clogging due to controlled burns of the vegetation, reducing water flow downstream as the accumulated water instead flows into the sand.

Before it enters Botswana, the river drops in a series of rapids known as Popa Falls, visible when the river is low, as during the dry season.

In the rainy season, an outflow to the Boteti River in turn seasonally discharges to the Makgadikgadi Pans, which features an expansive area of rainy-season wetland where tens of thousands of flamingos congregate each summer. Part of the river&#x27;s flow fills Lake Ngami. Noted for its wildlife, the Okavango area contains Botswana&#x27;s Moremi Game Reserve.

== Flood ==

Every wet season, Angola receives three times more rainfall than Botswana, discharging a higher than usual flow into the Okavango, turning swathes of outlying desert into a huge wetland.

Although the summer rains fall in Angola in January, they take a whole month to travel the first 1,000 km of the Okavango River, and then they take a further four months to filter through the plants and numerous channels of the final 250 km of the delta. As a result, the flood is at its biggest sometime between June and August, during Botswana&#x27;s dry winter months. The delta then swells to three times its permanent size, attracting animals from kilometres around and creating one of Africa&#x27;s greatest concentrations of wildlife.

At its widest point in a big flood year, the seasonal swamp stretches to 150 km across from east to west; one of the factors that leads to the ever-changing nature of the delta is the flatness of the area. If one were to take a cross section of the delta at its widest point, one would find that the height variation from the mean over that 150 km is less than 2 m, which means that a minor sand deposition can cause major changes.

In very wet years, a part of the river&#x27;s flow may extend along the Magweggana River (actually a northeastern distributary of the Okavango Delta) and enter the Zambezi River, bypassing the Kalahari.

== Sediment transport ==
The river carries annually 28,000 tonnes of suspended sediment and a similar amount of bedload to the terminal swamps. Most of the particulate sediment carried by the river is fine sand, with some silt and mud, thanks to the geological makeup of the Okavango River catchment which is largely underlain by Kalahari sand. There is low concentration of dissolved solids in the river water - around 40 mg/L, made up mostly of silica, calcium and magnesium bicarbonates - but these dissolved solids form the largest component of sediment carried into the delta because the annual water volume is so large.

== History ==
During colder periods in Earth&#x27;s history, a part of the Kalahari was a massive lake, known as Lake Makgadikgadi. In this time, the Okavango would have been one of its largest tributaries.
== Water conflict ==
Both Namibia and Botswana experience drought, and as a result, concerns have been expressed about possible conflict over use of the river&#x27;s water. Namibia has built a water canal, measuring about 300 km long, and has proposed a project to build a 250 km pipeline to divert water from the river into Namibia to help relieve the drought.

Botswana, however, uses the Okavango Delta for both tourism income and a water source. The Department of Water Affairs in Botswana has submitted that 97% of the water in the river is lost through evaporation, so the country cannot afford to lose any extra water.

Namibia, in turn, has argued that it will only divert half of one percent of the river&#x27;s flow, and that it is entitled to any water that flows through its territory. To deal with such issues, in September 1994, Angola, Namibia, and Botswana signed an agreement to form the Permanent Okavango River Basin Water Commission, to provide advice to the three countries about the best ways to share the Okavango River&#x27;s resources.

===Oil exploration===
ReconAfrica, a petroleum exploration company headquartered in Canada, has obtained exploration licenses for more than 13,600 square miles of land in the Kavango Region of Namibia and in Botswana. In January 2021 ReconAfrica announced the start of drilling operations on the first exploration well. Environmental activists have expressed concern that ReconAfrica’s plans for its test wells have not been properly vetted through Namibia’s environmental review process, however ReconAfrica and both the governments of Namibia and Botswana have stated that the company&#x27;s activities have followed due process and that no fracking will occur. ReconAfrica’s drilling area is in the Kavango West region which contains a multicountry conservation park, six locally managed wildlife reserves, and one UNESCO World Heritage site, however the drilling license does not include any of these protected areas.

<doc id="514203" wikidata="Q1196071" url="?curid=514203" title="Collie">
<text>Collies form a distinctive type of herding dogs, including many related landraces and standardized breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. Collies are medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dogs, with pointed snouts. Many types have a distinctive white color over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially North America and Australia), and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes mixed with other dog types.

Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs for herding cattle, sheep, and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the American Kennel Club has a breed they call &quot;collie&quot;, in fact &quot;collie dogs&quot; are a distinctive type of herding dog inclusive of many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports: The latter typically display great agility, stamina, and trainability, and most importantly intelligence.
Common use of the unmodified name &quot;collie&quot; in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds – the name means Rough Collie by default in parts of the United States, and Border Collie by default in many rural parts of Great Britain. Many collie dog types do not actually include &quot;collie&quot; in their name – for example the Welsh Sheepdog.

==Name==
The exact origin of the name &quot;collie&quot; is uncertain; it may derive from the Scots word for &#x27;coal&#x27;. Alternatively it may come from the related word &quot;coolly&quot;, referring to the black-faced mountain sheep of Scotland. The &quot;collie&quot; name usually refers to dogs of Scottish origin which have spread into many other parts of the world, often being called sheepdog or shepherd dog elsewhere.
Iris Combe, in her book, “Border Collies,” says that in old Gaelic “collie” was the rural term for anything useful — a “collie dog” was a useful dog.

==Description==

===Appearance===
Collies are generally medium-sized dogs of about and light to medium-boned. Cattle-herding types are stockier than sheep-herding types. The fur may be short,
or long, and the tail may be smooth, feathered, or bushy. In the 1800s, the occasional naturally bob-tailed dog would occur. The tail can be carried low with an upward swirl, or may be carried higher but never over the back. Each breed can vary in coloration, with the usual base colors being black, black-and-tan, red, red-and-tan, white with a colored head with it without other body coloration of sable, black and tan, blue merle, sable merle sable. They often have white along with the main color, usually under the belly and chest, over the shoulders, and on parts of the face and legs, but sometimes leaving only the head colored – or white may be absent (unusual) or limited to the chest and toes (as in the Australian Kelpie). Merle coloration may also be present over any of the other color combinations, even in landrace types. The most widespread patterns include sable, black and white, black and tan and tricolour (black-and-tan and white).

===Temperament===
Collies range in trainability from the &quot;average&quot; to very biddable. The Border Collie is the breed most in need of a &quot;job&quot; to stimulate its brain, lest it become anxious and hyper, while many other collie breeds fit well into an active family lifestyle (though all collie types still require some mental stimulation). Collie-type breeds are also known for their sensitivity and awareness of emotions in people; they may require gentler handling than other types of dogs.

=== Working type temperaments ===
A working member of a collie breed, such as the Border Collie, is an energetic and agile dog with great stamina. When in fit, working condition they are able to run all day without tiring, even over very rough or steep ground. Working collies display a keen intelligence for the job at hand and are instinctively highly motivated. They are often intensely loyal. Dogs of collie type or derivation occupy four of the first sixteen ranks in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, with the Border Collie being first. These characteristics generally make working strains suitable for agility; in addition to herding work they are well suited to active sports such as sheepdog trials, flyball, disc dog and dog agility. Working strains have strong herding instincts, and some individuals can be single-minded to the point of obsessiveness. Collies can compete in herding events. Border Collies are used as search dogs in mountain rescue in Britain. They are particularly useful for searching large areas of hillside and avalanche debris. H. MacInnes believed that dark coated dogs are less prone to snow blindness.

=== Show and pet type temperaments ===
Certain types of collie (for example Rough Collies, Smooth Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs and some strains of Border Collie and other breeds) have been bred for many generations as pets and for the sport of conformation showing, not as herding dogs. All collie dog breeds have proved to be highly trainable, gentle, loyal, intelligent, and well suited as pets. Their gentleness and devotion also make them quite compatible with children. They are often more suitable as watchdogs than as guard dogs, though the individual personalities of these dogs vary.

The temperament of these breeds has been featured in literature, film, and popular television programs. The novels of Albert Payson Terhune, which were very popular in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, celebrated the temperament and companionship of his early AKC collies. More famously, the temperament and intelligence of the Rough Collie were exaggerated to mythic proportions in the character Lassie, which has been the subject of many films, books, and television shows from 1938 to the present.

The Lassie character was featured in a book titled &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; by Eric P. Knight. Knight&#x27;s collie &quot;Tootsie&quot; was the inspiration for the book, which was a collection of stories based on her and other collie legends he collected from talking to friends and neighbors. One such story was most likely the documented tale of &quot;Silverton Bobbie&quot;, the Oregon collie who crossed the US to get to his owners. While the dogs who played Lassie on-screen were from AKC lines, the actual Tootsie looked nothing like them, although she did come from a collie breeder.

==Health==
Some collie breeds (especially the Rough Collie, Smooth Collie, and the Australian Shepherd) are affected by a genetic defect, a mutation within the MDR1 gene, formerly known as &quot;ivermectin sensitivity&quot;, but now known to cause lowered tolerance to a wide variety of different veterinary drugs. Approximately 70% of collies are affected, making them very sensitive to some drugs, such as Ivermectin, as well as to some antibiotics, opioids including loperamide, and steroids – over 100 drugs in total. The MDR1 status of individual dogs can be easily tested for. In addition, the intestinal functional system of this breed is also very fragile, and compared with similar medium and large dogs, they are easy to receive food stimulation, which leads to vomiting and excretion abnormalities or gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, breeders need to ensure strict hygiene for dogs to eat fresh ingredients, and rich nutrition. The &quot;Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen&quot; (The German Kennel Club) encourages breed clubs to test all breeding stock and avoid breeding from affected dogs.

Collies may have a genetic disease, named &quot;canine cyclic neutropenia&quot;, or &quot;grey collie syndrome&quot;. This is a stem cell disorder. Puppies with this disorder are quite often mistaken for healthy Blue Merles, even though their colour is a silver grey. Affected puppies rarely live more than 6 months. For a puppy to be affected, both the sire and the dam have to be carriers of the disorder.

Canine familial dermatomyositis is an inherited idiopathic condition affecting the skin and muscle and in rare cases the blood vessels. The condition causes dermatitis throughout the body and proceeds to myositis which in severe cases leads to megaesophagus. Collies alongside the Beauceron and Shetland Sheepdog are known to have a predilection to the condition although it has been described in other breeds.

Collie eye anomaly is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a mutation in the NHEJ1 gene that affects Collies and related breeds.

==Collie types and breeds==
Herding dogs of collie type have long been widespread in Britain, and these can be regarded as a landrace from which a number of other landraces, types, and formal breeds have been derived, both in Britain and elsewhere. Many of them are working herding dogs, but some have been bred for conformation showing and as pets, sometimes losing their working instincts in the course of selection for appearance or for a more subdued temperament.

Herding types tend to vary in appearance more than conformation and pet types, as they are bred primarily for their working ability, and appearance is thus of lower importance.

Dogs of collie type or ancestry include:

; Australian Kelpie: Developed in Australia from collies originally brought from Scotland and northern England. Erect ears, short-haired, usually black, black-and-tan or red-and-tan, with white limited to chest and toes.
; Australian Shepherd: Derives its name from the sheep imported from Australia in the 19th century, but native to the Western United States. Used as both a drover and guardian of sheep and cattle. Ancestry almost certainly includes British collie types and Basque and Spanish sheepdogs. Shaggy mid length coat in every colour including merle, half prick ears, bobbed tail, and (very important) eyes of different colour, heterochromia very common. 

; Bearded Collie: Now largely a pet and show breed, but still of the collie type, and some are used as working dogs. The Beardie has a flat, harsh, strong and shaggy outer coat and a soft, furry undercoat. The coat falls naturally to either side without need of a part. Long hair on the cheeks, lower lips, and under the chin forms the beard for which it is known.
: All Bearded Collies are born black, blue, brown, or fawn, with or without white markings. Some carry a fading gene, and as they mature, the coat lightens, darkening again slightly after one year of age. A puppy born black may become any shade of gray from black to slate to silver. The dogs that are born brown will lighten from chocolate to sandy, and the blues and fawns show shades from dark to light. Dogs without the fading gene stay the color they were when they were born. The white only occurs as a blaze on the face, on the head, on the tip of the tail, on the chest, legs, feet, and around the neck. Tan markings occasionally appear on the eyebrows, inside the ears, on the cheeks, under the root of the tail and on the legs where the white joins the main color.
; Blue Lacy: Grey or red all over, short hair, floppy ears. Derived partly from the English Shepherd, with other non-collie breeds.

; Border Collie: The most well known breed for herding sheep throughout the world. Originally developed in Scotland and Northern England. Not always suitable for herding cattle. Ears semi-erect or floppy, fur silky or fairly long, but short on face and legs; red, black, black-and-tan or merle, all usually with white over shoulders, alternatively mostly white with coloured patches on head. Coat can be either long or short.
; Cumberland Sheepdog: An extinct breed similar to the Border Collie and possibly absorbed into that breed. An ancestor of the Australian Shepherd. Erect or semi-erect ears, dense fur, black with white only on face and chest.
; English Shepherd: Developed in the U.S. from stock of Farm Collie type originally from Britain. Floppy ears, thick fur, red, black or black-and-tan, with white over shoulders. Not to be confused with the very different Old English Sheepdog.
; German Coolie: Also called &quot;Koolie&quot;, or &quot;German Collie&quot;. Developed in Australia, probably from British collies, but may have included dogs from Germany and Spain. Erect ears, short fur, black, red, black-and-tan or merle, often with some white on neck or over shoulders. (Note: the name &quot;German Collie&quot; is also applied to a cross between a German Shepherd and a Border Collie.)
; Huntaway: Developed in New Zealand from a mixture of breeds, probably including some collie – but it is not of the collie type. Larger and more heavily built than most collies, floppy ears, most commonly black-and-tan with little white.
; Lurcher: Not an established breed, but a cross of collie (or other herding dog or terrier) with Greyhound or other sight hound. Traditionally bred for poaching, with the speed of a sight hound but more obedient and less conspicuous. Variable in appearance, but with greyhound build: Floppy ears, tall, slender, with small head, deep chest and &quot;herring gut&quot;; smooth, silky or rough coat, often brindled.
; McNab Shepherd: Developed in the U.S. from Scotch Collies and dogs imported by Basque sheepherders. Variable in size, erect or semi-erect ears, short to medium fur, black or red with some white on face, chest and/or feet.
; New Zealand Heading Dog: Also called &quot;New Zealand Eye Dog&quot;. Developed in New Zealand from Border Collie heritage and used to bring sheep towards the shepherd, especially with strong eye contact and no barking.
; Old English Sheepdog: Derived from &quot;Shags&quot;, hairy herding dogs, themselves derived from &quot;Beards&quot;, the ancestors of the Bearded Collie. Modern dogs larger than most collies, no tail, floppy ears, long silky hair (including on face), usually grey and white. Not to be confused with the English Shepherd.
; Scotch Collie: Scotch collies are separated into two varieties or breeds: Rough Collie and Smooth Collie. They are rather a different type to other collies with a long narrow face, tall, profuse coat and semi-erect ears. They are still used for herding as well as for showing. They were developed in the highlands of Scotland which is why they needed a profuse coat. There are four recognised colors: Sable, tri-color, blue merle, and color headed white. Non-recognized colors are: Bi-black, sable merle, harlequin, red merle, red tricolor, and black and tan. Both the Rough and Smooth Collies are double-coated with Smooths having a shorter or &quot;smooth&quot; outer coat. There are three different coat types of Rough Collies: Brandwyn (fluffy coats), Parader (flat long coats) and the working type (medium-length coats).
; Shetland Sheepdog: A small show and pet breed developed in England partly from herding dogs originating in Shetland. The original Shetland dogs were not collies, but instead working herding dogs of Spitz type, similar to the Icelandic Sheepdog. However, in the development of the modern Shetland breed these Spitz-type dogs were heavily mixed with the Rough Collie and toy breeds, and now are similar in appearance to a miniature Rough Collie. Very small, nearly erect ears, long silky fur on body, most commonly sable or merle, with white over shoulders.

; Smithfield: Originally a British type, now extinct used for droving cattle in the south-east of England, especially the Smithfield Market in London. They were large, strong collies, with white or black-and-white fur, and floppy-ears. Occasionally the name is used for modern dogs of a somewhat similar type in Australia. The name &quot;Smithfield&quot; is used to describe the shaggy Tasmanian farm dog of Bearded Collie type; and is also applied to the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog and may have contributed to the Australian Koolie.
; Welsh Sheepdog: Landrace herding dog from Wales. Erect or semi-erect ears, short or silky fur, red, black, black-and-tan, or merle, all usually with white over shoulders.

<text>The Drukpa or Drukpa Kagyu () lineage, sometimes called Dugpa in older sources, is a branch of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Kagyu school is one of the Sarma or &quot;New Translation&quot; schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The Drukpa lineage was founded in the Tsang region of Tibet by Tsangpa Gyare (1161–1211), and later became influential in Ladakh and Bhutan. It is one of several lineages known as &quot;Red Hat sects&quot;.

Within the Drukpa lineage, there are further sub-schools, most notably the eastern Kham tradition and middle Drukpa school which prospered in Ladakh and surrounding areas. In Bhutan the Drukpa lineage is the dominant school and state religion.

==History==
The Drukpa lineage was founded in the Tsang region of Tibet by Tsangpa Gyare (1161–1211), a student of Ling Repa, who mastered the Vajrayana practices of the mahamudra and Six Yogas of Naropa at an early age. As a tertön or &quot;finder of spiritual relics&quot;, he discovered the text of the &quot;Six Equal Tastes&quot;, previously hidden by Rechung Dorje Drakpa, the student of Milarepa. While on a pilgrimage, Tsangpa Gyare and his disciples witnessed a set of nine dragons (Tibetan: &quot;druk&quot;) roaring out of the earth and into the skies, as flowers rained down everywhere. From this incident they named their sect &quot;Drukpa.&quot;

Also important in the lineage were the root guru of Tsangpa Gyare, Ling Repa and his guru, Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo, who was in turn a principal disciple of Gampopa as well as Dampa Sumpa, one of Rechung Dorje Drakpa&#x27;s main disciples.

A prominent disciple of Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s nephew, Onre Darma Sengye, was Phajo Drugom Zhigpo (1208–1276) who in 1222 went to establish the Drukapa Kagyu teachings in the valleys of western Bhutan.

===Branches===
The disciples of Tsangpa Gyare Yeshi Dorje (1161–1211), the first Gyalwang Drukpa, may be divided into two categories: blood relatives and spiritual sons. His nephew, Onre Darma Sengye (1177–1237), ascended the throne at Ralung, the main seat of the Drukpa lineage. Darma Sengye guided the later disciples of Tsangpa Gyare, such as Gotsangpa Gonpo Dorje (1189–1258), onto the path of realization, thus becoming their guru as well. Darma Sengye&#x27;s nephew and their descendants held the seat at Ralung and continued the lineage.

Gyalwa Lorepa, Gyalwa Gotsangpa and his disciple Gyalwa Yang Gonpa, are known as Gyalwa Namsum or the Three Victorious Ones in recognition of their spiritual realization. The followers of Gyalwa Lorepa came to be called the &#x27;Lower Drukpas&#x27;. The followers of Gyalwa Gotsangpa came to be called the &#x27;Upper Drukpas&#x27;. And the followers of Onre Darma Sengye came to be called the &#x27;Middle Drukpas&#x27;.

After the death of 4th Gyalwang Drukpa, Kunkhyen Pema Karpo, in 1592, there were two rival candidates for his reincarnation. Gyalwang Pagsam Wangpo, one of the candidates, was favored by the King of Tsang and prevailed. His rival, Ngawang Namgyal, was then invited to Western Bhutan and eventually he unified the entire country and established Drukpa as the preeminent Buddhist school from Haa all the way to Trongsa.

The Drukpa lineage was divided from that time on into the Northern Drukpa (, ) branch in Tibet headed by the Gyalwang Drukpa and the Southern Drukpa (, ) based in Bhutan and headed by the Zhabdrung incarnations. Ever since Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal appointed Pekar Jungne as the 1st Je Khenpo, the spiritual head of all monasteries in Bhutan, successive Je Khenpos have acted to date as spiritual regents of Bhutan.

===Sub-schools===
Several of Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s students started sub-schools, the most important of which were the Lower Drukpa founded by Gyalwa Lorepa Wangchug Tsondru and the Upper Drukpa founded by Gyalwa Gotsangpa Gonpo Dorje. This branch further gave rise to several important sub-schools. However the chief monasteries and succession of Gyalwang Drukpa Tsangpa Gyare passed to his nephew, Önre Darma Senge, at Ralung Monastery; this lineage was known as the Central Drukpa. This lineage of hereditary &quot;prince-abbots&quot; of Ralung continued until 1616, when Ngawang Namgyal, the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, fled to Bhutan due to a dispute over the incarnation of the 4th Gyalwang Drukpa and the enmity of the Tsangpa ruler. Due to those events, the Central Drukpa split into the Southern Drukpa led by the Zhabdrung and his successors in Bhutan and the Northern Drukpa led by Gyalwang Pagsam Wangpo and the successive Gyalwang Drukpa tulkus in Tibet.

====Lower Drukpa====
The Lower Drukpa () was founded by Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s disciple Loré Wangchuk Tsöndrü (, 1187-1250). Lorepa built the Üri () and Sengeri () monasteries and visited Bhutan, where he founded Tharpaling Monastery () in Jakar. A special transmission of the Lower Drukpa lineage is known as The Five Capabilities (), which are:
#Being capable of [facing] death: capability of Mahāmudrā ()
#Being capable of [wearing only] the cotton cloth: capability of tummo ()
#Being capable of the tantric activities done in seclusion ()
#Being capable of [facing] the disturbances of &quot;&#x27;don&quot; spirits: sickness ()
#Being capable of [facing] circumstances: capability of [applying] antidotes ()

====Upper Drukpa====
The Upper Drukpa () was founded Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s disciple Götsangpa Gönpo Dorjé (, 1189-1258), a highly realized yogi who had many disciples. His main disciples were Orgyenpa Rinchenpel (, 1230—1309), Yanggönpa (), Chilkarpa () and Neringpa.

Orgyenpa, who was also a disciple of Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama, became a great siddha who traveled to Bodhgaya, Jalandhar, Oddiyana and China. In Oddiyana he received teachings related to the Six Branch Yoga of the Kalachakra system known as the &quot;Approach and Attainment of the Three Adamantine States&quot; () and, after returning to Tibet, founded the Orgyen Nyendrup tradition and wrote many works including a famous guide to the land of Oddiyana. Ogyenpa had many disciples including Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama, Kharchupa (, 1284—1339) and Tokden Daseng ().

Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang (1255-1343) was a great scholar of the Upper Drukpa succession of Yanggönpa. He established the Barawa sub-school, which for a time was widespread in Tibet and survived as an independent lineage until 1959. For a time this lineage was also important in Bhutan.

====Central Drukpa====
The Middle Drukpa () was the hereditary lineage of Tsangpa Gyare centered at Ralung. Following Tsangpa Gyare, the next holder of this lineage was his nephew Darma Sengge (, 1177-1237), son of Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s brother Lhanyen (). Darma Sengge was succeeded by his own nephew Zhönnu Sengge (, 1200–66) and he by his nephew Nyima Sengge (, 1251-1287).

The lineage then went to his cousin Dorje Lingpa Sengge Sherap (, 1238-1287), son of Wöntak (), a member of the branch of the Drukpa lineage descended from Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s brother Lhambum ). The lineage passed to Sengge Sherap&#x27;s brother Sengge Rinchen (, 1258-1313), who was succeeded in turn by his son Sengge Gyelpo (, 1289-1326), grandson Jamyang Künga Senggé (, 1289-1326), great-grandson Lodrö Sengge (, 1345–90) and great-great-grandson Sherap Sengge (, 1371–92). These first nine holders of Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s lineage were known as the &quot;Incomparable Nine Lions&quot; ().

Sherap Sengge, who died at the age of 21, was succeeded on the throne of Ralung by his elder brother Yeshe Rinchen (, 1364-1413) and he by his sons Namkha Pelzang (, 1398-1425) and Sherap Zangpo (, 1400–38). These three were considered the emanations of the three mahāsattvas Manjusri, Vajrapani and Avalokiteśvara, respectively. Sherap Zangpo&#x27;s son was the second Gyalwang Drukpa, Gyelwang Jé Künga Penjor (, 1428–76), who received teachings from the most renowned lamas of his age and became a great author and teacher.

From the 2nd Gyalwang Drukpa, the lineage passed to his nephew Ngakwang Chögyel (, 1465-1540), then successively in turns from father to son to Ngak gi Wangchuk Drakpa Gyeltsen (, 1517-1554), Mipham Chögyal (, 1543-1604), Mipham Tenpa&#x27;i Nyima (, 1567-1619) and Ngawang Namgyal, who was the great-great-grandson of Ngawang Chögyal.

In the Middle Drukpa tradition many great scholars appeared including the fourth Gyalwang Drukpa, Kunkhyen Pema Karpo &quot;(kun mkhyen padma dkar po)&quot; [1527—1592], Khewang Sangay Dorji &quot;(mkhas dbang sangs rgyas rdo rje)&quot; [1569—1645] and Bod Khepa Mipham Geleg Namgyal &quot;(bod mkhas pa mi pham dge legs rnam rgyal)&quot; (1618—1685) who was famed for his knowledge of poetics, grammar and medicine. His collected works fill over twenty volumes in modern editions. He founded Sangngak Chö Monastery () in 1571 to &quot;subdue the klo pa&quot;, the inhabitants of southeastern Tibet. This monastery, which is located in modern Lhoka Prefecture of the Tibet Autonomous Region near the border with Arunachal Pradesh, India, became the seat of the successive Gyalwang Drukpa incarnations in Tibet and thus the center of the Northern Drukpa.

Three great siddhas of Middle Drukpa school were Tsangnyön Heruka (1452-1507), author of the &quot;Life of Milarepa&quot;, the &quot;Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa&quot;, the &quot;Life of Rechungpa&quot;, and compiler of the &quot;Demchog Khandro Nyengyud&quot;; Drukpa Kunley (1455-1529); and Ünyön Künga Zangpo (, 1458-1532). All three were disciples of the 4th Gyalwang Drukpa.

Following the death of the 4th Gyalwang Drukpa, two incarnations were recognized: Paksam Wangpo (), who was the offspring of the Chongje Depa, and Ngawang Namgyal, who was also the heir to Drukpa lineage of Ralung. Paksam Wangpo gained the backing of the powerful Tsangpa Desi, who was a patron of the Karma Kagyu and hostile to Ngawang Namgyal. The latter subsequently fled to Bhutan, where his lineage already had many followers, established the Southern Drukpa, and became both the spiritual and temporal head of the country, after which the country became known as &quot;Drukyül&quot; in Standard Tibetan and Dzongkha.

==Contemporary organisation==
The Southern Drukpa are led by the Je Khenpo (an elected office, not a tulku lineage), who is the chief abbot of the Dratshang Lhentshog of Bhutan.

The Northern Drukpa are led by the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa or incarnation of the Gyalwang Drukpa. In Kham, Khamtrul Rinpoche traditionally has been the most prominent Drukpa lineage master, and still commands a huge following in Kham.

Unlike previously where the lineage was divided geographically into Northern, Middle and Southern Drukpa, the Drukpa lineage masters today often cross these traditional borders and communicate to strengthen the lineage and the teachings. In April 2009, the first of a yearly event known as the Annual Drukpa Council (ADC) was held on Druk Amitabha Mountain in Kathmandu, Nepal. More than 40 masters of the lineage from India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet attended this event and over 10,000 lay practitioners and at least 1,000 monks and nuns or more met on this occasion. This was the first time an annual event for the Drukpa lineage involving all the three major branches will be held, as a concerted effort to reunite the strengths of the Drukpa lineage and to mend the historical connections of different monasteries and organizations.

In July 2007, when the lineage celebrated its 800-plus-years&#x27; legacy in Shey, Ladakh, more than 100,000 attended the event that included celebrations and prayers, as well as mask dancing by 300 nuns. This event, boasted of the first firework in the Himalayas, the first 800 sky lanterns being lit in the Himalayas and the first 12,000 biodegradable balloons sent to the sky, was covered by international media

In 2010, the Gyalwang Drukpa launched an initiative to plant one million trees in Ladakh, as part of the &#x27;one million trees&#x27; campaign initiated by Wangari Maathaï, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. As part of this initiative, the Gyalwang Drukpa led the Live to Love volunteers to break the Guinness World Record twice for most trees planted simultaneously. The first in October 2010, 9,313 volunteers planted 50,033 trees within half an hour, breaking their first Guinness World Records for the &quot;Most Trees Planted&quot; category. In October 2012, they broke again the Guinness World Records for the same category, with over 9,800 volunteers planted nearly 100,000 trees, safeguarding villages from mudslides and cleaning polluted air.

The Drukpa lineage under the guidance of its spiritual masters, in particular the Twelfth Gyalwang Drukpa, has established centers across the world, especially in Europe.

In 2016, National Geographic Books published the book &quot;StarTalk: Everything You Ever Need to Know About Space Travel, Sci-Fi, the Human Race, the Universe, and Beyond&quot;, in which a fragment of an interview Neil deGrasse Tyson, Eugene Mirman, and Jason Sudekis had with the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa was released where the Drukpa discussed his views on trees and religion. He believes that trees, plants, and nature communicate with Buddhists, Christians, and those of every religion and lack thereof.

==Commemorative stamp==

On 14 May 2014, the Department of Posts celebrated Buddha Purnima with the release of a commemorative stamp on the Drukpa Buddhists, a rare and perhaps the first recognition given by the Indian government to a particular Buddhist lineage.

==Conversion by Karma Kagyu==

On 10 September 2014, the Gyalwang Drukpa issued an official statement accusing Beijing of fanning intra-sect rivalries by using the Chinese-led subset-under-occupation of the Karma Kagyu to forcibly take over Drukpa monasteries in the holy Mount Kailash area of Tibet, with Drukpa monks and yogis being forced out of their monasteries, and photographs of Drukpa masters replaced with photographs of the (Chinese-recognized) Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje. The Gyalwang Drukpa stated, &quot;They are using (the Karmapa&#x27;s) name, but I don&#x27;t think he is responsible.&quot;

The office of Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje quickly replied, saying, &quot;His Holiness does not believe in (forced) conversion. He has a broad outlook, and there is no conversion plan. He believes in harmony and dialogue between all sects, and we all belong to the broad Buddhist tradition.&quot; Spokesperson Kunzang Chunvyalp added that the Karmapa has urged that Drukpa monasteries which have been desecrated &quot;be restored because they are very sacred.&quot;

==Kung-Fu Nuns==
In 2018 BBC reported on the Kung Fu Nuns from the Drukpa Kagyu school who are mostly black belts in kung fu. After a visit to Vietnam where the Gyalwang Drukpa saw nuns receiving combat training, he decided to bring the idea back to Nepal by encouraging nuns to learn self-defence. His motive was simple: promote gender equality and empower young women who mostly came from poor backgrounds in India and Tibet. Kung-Fu Nuns also learn skills that are available only to monks in other lineages, such as plumbing, driving, and electrical fitting.

==Monasteries==
Important monasteries of the Drukpa order include:
*Druk Sangag Choeling Monastery
*Hemis Monastery
*Kardang Monastery, the main monastery in Lahaul
*Punakha Dzong, the winter home of the Dratshang Lhentshog
*Ralung Monastery in Central Tibet just north of Bhutan
*Tashichho Dzong, Thimphu, which houses the Dratshang Lhentshog in summer

<doc id="514209" wikidata="Q650872" url="?curid=514209" title="Okavango Delta">
<text>The Okavango Delta (or Okavango Grassland; formerly spelled &quot;Okovango&quot; or &quot;Okovanggo&quot;) in Botswana is a vast inland delta formed where the Okavango River reaches a tectonic trough at an altitude of in the central part of the endorheic basin of the Kalahari Desert. 

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the few interior delta systems that do not flow into a sea or ocean, with a wetland system that is largely intact. All the water reaching the delta is ultimately evaporated and transpired. Each year, about of water spreads over the area. Some flood waters drain into Lake Ngami. The area was once part of Lake Makgadikgadi, an ancient lake that had mostly dried up by the early Holocene.

The Moremi Game Reserve is on the eastern side of the delta. The delta was named one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, which were officially declared on 11 February 2013 in Arusha, Tanzania. On 22 June 2014, the Okavango Delta became the 1000th site to be officially inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

==Geography==

===Floods===

The Okavango is produced by seasonal flooding. The Okavango River drains the summer (January–February) rainfall from the Angola highlands and the surge flows in around one month. The waters then spread over the area of the delta over the next four months (March–June). 

The high temperature of the delta causes rapid transpiration and evaporation, resulting in three cycles of rising and falling water levels that were not fully understood until the early 20th century. The flood peaks between June and August, during Botswana&#x27;s dry winter months, when the delta swells to three times its permanent size, attracting animals from kilometres around and creating one of Africa’s greatest concentrations of wildlife.

The delta is very flat, with less than variation in height across its , while the water drops about 60 m from Mohembo to Maun.

===Water flow===

===Lagoons===

When the water levels gradually recede, water remains in major canals and river beds, in waterholes and in a number of larger lagoons, which then attract increasing numbers of animals. Photo-safari camps and lodges are found near some of these lagoons. Among the larger lagoons are:
*Dombo Hippo Pool ()
*Gcodikwe Lagoon ()
*Guma Lagoon ()
*Jerejere Lagoon/Hippo Pool ()
*Moanachira Lagoon/Sausage Island ()
*Moanachira Lagoon ()
*Shinde Lagoon ()
*Xakanaxa Lagoon ()
*Xhamu Lagoon ()
*Xhobega Lagoon ()
*Xugana Lagoon ()
*Zibadiania Lagoon ()

===Salt islands===
The agglomeration of salt around plant roots leads to barren white patches in the centre of many of the thousands of islands, which have become too salty to support plants, aside from the odd salt-resistant palm tree. Trees and grasses grow in the sand around the edges of the islands that have not become too salty yet.

About 70% of the islands began as termite mounds (often &quot;Macrotermes&quot; spp.), where a tree then takes root on the mound of soil.

===Chief&#x27;s Island===
Chief&#x27;s Island (), the largest island in the delta, was formed by a fault line which uplifted an area over and . Historically, it was reserved as an exclusive hunting area for the chief, but is now a protected area for wildlife. It now provides the core area for much of the resident wildlife when the waters rise.

== Climate ==

The Delta&#x27;s profuse greenery is not the result of a wet climate; rather, it is an oasis in an arid country. The average annual rainfall is (approximately one-third that of its Angolan catchment area) and most of it falls between December and March in the form of heavy afternoon thunderstorms.

December to February are hot wet months with daytime temperatures as high as , warm nights, and humidity levels fluctuating between 50 and 80%. From March to May, the temperature reduces, with a maximum of during the day and mild to cool nights. The rains quickly dry up leading into the dry, cool winter months of June to August. Daytime temperatures at this time of year are mild to warm, but the temperature falls considerably after sunset. Nights can be cold in the delta, with temperatures barely above freezing. Frost is sometimes seen over the winter.

The September to November span has the heat and atmospheric pressure build up once more, as the dry season slides into the rainy season. October is the most challenging month for visitors: daytime temperatures often push past and the dryness is only occasionally broken by a sudden cloudburst.

==Fauna of the delta==
The Okavango Delta is both a permanent and seasonal home to a wide variety of wildlife which is now a popular tourist attraction. All of the big five game animals—the lion, leopard, African buffalo, African bush elephant and rhinoceros (both black and white rhinoceros)—are present.

Other species include giraffe, blue wildebeest, plains zebra, hippopotamus, impala, common eland, greater kudu, sable antelope, roan antelope, puku, lechwe, waterbuck, sitatunga, tsessebe, cheetah, African wild dog, spotted hyena, black-backed jackal, caracal, serval, aardvark, aardwolf, bat-eared fox, African savanna hare, honey badger, crested porcupine, common warthog, chacma baboon, vervet monkey and Nile crocodile.

The delta also hosts over 400 bird species, including the helmeted guineafowl, African fish eagle, Pel&#x27;s fishing owl, Egyptian goose, South African shelduck, African jacana, African skimmer, marabou stork, crested crane, African spoonbill, African darter, southern ground hornbill, wattled crane, lilac-breasted roller, secretary bird, and common ostrich. Prime bird-watching areas are those with a mix of habitats such as the panhandle, the seasonal delta and the parts of the Moremi Game Reserve that are close to the water.

Since 2005, the protected area has been considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with Hwange National Park.

In 1992, the black rhino was thought to be extinct in the Okavango Delta, while only 19 white rhinos remained. By 1993, all rhinos had been killed in Botswana. Hundreds of white and black rhinos were reintroduced by the Botswana Rhino Reintroduction Project founded in 2000. From 2010 to 2018, seven rhinos were killed by poachers. By 2019, the rhino population in Botswana had decreased to an estimated 400, with the largest population of roughly 150 living in the northern Okavango Delta. From 2020 to 2021, 92 rhinos were killed by poachers in the delta region leaving only 40 individuals, prompting the government to move those rhinos out of the Okavango Delta.
The most abundant large mammal is the lechwe, with estimates suggesting approximately 88,000 individuals. The lechwe a bit larger than an impala, with elongated hooves and a water-repellent substance on its legs that enable rapid movement through knee-deep water. Lechwe graze on aquatic plants and, like the waterbuck, take to water when threatened by predators. Only the males have horns.

===Fish===
The Okavango Delta is home to 71 fish species, including the tigerfish, species of tilapia, and various species of catfish. Fish sizes range from the African sharptooth catfish to the sickle barb. The same species are found in the Zambezi River, indicating an historic link between the two river systems.

==Flora of the delta==
The Okavango Delta is home to 1068 plants which belong to 134 families and 530 genera. There are five important plant communities in the perennial swamp: &quot;Papyrus cyperus&quot; in the deeper waters&quot;, Miscanthus&quot; in the shallowly flooded sites, and &quot;Phragmites australis&quot;, &quot;Typha capensis&quot; and &quot;Pycreus&quot; in between. The swamp-dominant species, which are usually found in the perennial swamp, also extend far into the seasonally inundated area. &quot;Papyrus cyperus&quot; reeds beds grow best in slow flowing waters of medium depth and are prominent at the channel sides. On the islands and mainlands edges above the flooded grasslands different communities of flora are found. These species are located according to their water preference: for instance &quot;Philenoptera violacea&quot; requires little water, is found at the highest elevations in the perennial swamps, and is common on drier seasonal swamp islands. Trees restricted to islands within the perennial swamp are a mixture of the palm &quot;Hyphaene&quot; &quot;petersiana&quot; and acacias.

The plants of the delta play an important role in providing cohesion for the sand. The banks or levees of a river normally have a high mud content, and this combines with the sand in the river’s load to continuously build up the river banks. The river’s load In the delta consists almost entirely of sand, because the clean waters of the Okavango contain little mud. The plants capture the sand, acting as the glue and making up for the lack of mud, and in the process creating further islands on which more plants can take root.

This process is not important in the formation of linear islands. They are long and thin and often curved like a gently meandering river because they are actually the natural banks of old river channels which have become blocked up by plant growth and sand deposition, resulting in the river changing course and the old river levees becoming islands. Due to the flatness of the delta and the large tonnage of sand flowing into it from the Okavango River, the floor of the delta is slowly but constantly rising. Where channels are today, islands will be tomorrow and then new channels may wash away these existing islands.

==People==

The Okavango Delta peoples consist of five ethnic groups, each with its own ethnic identity and language:

* the Hambukushu (also known as Mbukushu, Bukushu, Bukusu, Mabukuschu, Ghuva, Haghuva), 
* the Dceriku (Dxeriku, Diriku, Gciriku, Gceriku, Giriku, Niriku),
* the Wayeyi (Bayei, Bayeyi, Yei), 
* the Bugakhwe (Kxoe, Khwe, Kwengo, Barakwena, ) 

* the (Gxanekwe, , River Bushmen, Swamp Bushmen, , , Xanekwe). 

The Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Wayeyi have traditionally engaged in mixed economies of millet/sorghum agriculture, fishing, hunting, the collection of wild plant foods, and pastoralism.

The Bugakhwe and are Bushmen, who have traditionally practised fishing, hunting, and the collection of wild plant foods; Bugakhwe used both forest and riverine resources, while the mostly focused on riverine resources. The Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Bugakhwe are present along the Okavango River in Angola and in the Caprivi Strip of Namibia, and small numbers of Hambukushu and Bugakhwe are in Zambia, as well. Within the Okavango Delta, over the past 150 years or so, Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Bugakhwe have inhabited the panhandle and the Magwegqana in the northeastern delta. have inhabited the panhandle and the area along the Boro River through the delta, as well as the area along the Boteti River.

The Wayeyi have inhabited the area around Seronga as well as the southern delta around Maun, and a few Wayeyi live in their putative ancestral home in the Caprivi Strip. Within the past 20 years many people from all over the Okavango have migrated to Maun, the late 1960s and early 1970s over 4,000 Hambukushu refugees from Angola were settled in the area around Etsha in the western Panhandle.

The Okavango Delta has been under the political control of the Batawana (a Tswana nation) since the late 18th century. Led by the house of Mathiba I, the leader of a Bangwato offshoot, the Batawana established complete control over the delta in the 1850s as the regional ivory trade exploded. Most Batawana, however, have traditionally lived on the edges of the delta, due to the threat that the tsetse fly poses to their cattle. During a hiatus of some 40 years, the tsetse fly retreated and most Batawana lived in the swamps from 1896 through the late 1930s. Since then, the edge of the delta has become increasingly crowded with its growing human and livestock populations.
==&quot;Molapos&quot; (water streams)==
After the flooding season, the waters in the lower parts of the delta, near the base, recede, leaving moisture behind in the soil. This residual moisture is used for planting fodder and other crops that can thrive on it. This land is locally known as &quot;molapo&quot;.

During 1974 to 1978, the floods were more intensive than normal and flood recession cropping was not possible, so severe food and fodder shortages occurred. In response, the Molapo Development Project was initiated. It protected the &quot;molapo&quot; areas with bunds to control the flooding and prevent severe flooding. The bunds are provided with sluice gates so the stored water can be released and flood recession cropping can start.

==Possible threats ==
One possible threat is oil exploration by Canadian company ReconAfrica. Initial exploration in April 2021 revealed oil deposits in sedimentary rock. Environmentalists are concerned that the project will have a negative ecological impact and that some of the main bodies of water could be threatened. 
ReconAfrica has stated, &quot;There will be no damage to the ecosystem from the planned activities.&quot;

The Namibian government has presented plans to build a hydropower station in the Zambezi Region, which would regulate the Okavango&#x27;s flow to some extent. While proponents argue that the effect would be minimal, environmentalists argue that this project could destroy most of the rich animal and plant life in the delta. Other threats include local human encroachment and regional extraction of water in both Angola and Namibia.

South African filmmaker and conservationist Rick Lomba warned in the 1980s of the threat of cattle invasion to the area. His documentary &quot;The End of Eden&quot; portrayed his lobbying on behalf of the delta.

The Okavango catchment is projected to experience decreasing annual rainfall as well as increasing temperatures as a result of global warming. The effects of global warming are likely to result in reductions in the extent of floodplains in the Okavango Delta, which will have significant impacts on water availability as well as livestock rearing and agricultural activities in the region.

<text>U.S. Highway 57 (US 57) is a north–south intrastate United States highway that follows a nearly east–west route in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Texas. The highway&#x27;s northern (eastern) terminus is about south of San Antonio, Texas, between Devine and Pearsall, at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35; old U.S. Highway 81). Its southern (western) terminus is in Eagle Pass, at the Rio Grande (Río Bravo), where it continues into Piedras Negras, Coahuila, as Mexican Federal Highway 57.

==Route description==
US 57 begins at the Eagle Pass – Piedras Negras International Bridge in Eagle Pass. The highway travels eastward through Eagle Pass on Garrison Street. On the east side of town, it turns northeast briefly and intersects US 277 Business on Main Street before turning back to the east. Six blocks later, it reaches the intersection with the main branch of US 277 and FM 3443. US 57 continues east, now concurrent with southbound US 277. About further, the highways diverge, with US 57 veering to the northeast. The highway travels through ranchland in Maverick County and travels through a United States Border Patrol interior checkpoint before reaching La Pryor, where it intersects US 83. US 57 continues eastward through Batesville and unincorporated areas of Zavala and Frio counties, intersecting several Farm to Market roads, before reaching its eastern terminus at Interstate 35 (I-35) southwest of the town of Moore.

==History==
This highway was originally designated in 1933 as Texas State Highway 76, which was previously designated in 1926 on a route from Nacogdoches to Joaquin which was replaced by SH 7 in 1933. From 1942 to 1964, its eastern half was reassigned to Farm to Market Road 394 (FM 394). In 1966, the state changed the highway&#x27;s number to 57 to provide continuity with Mexican Federal Highway 57, a similarly-numbered route across the Mexican border.

In 1970, the highway was commissioned as a United States Highway, and retained its &quot;57&quot; designation to create a single-numbered international corridor. The highway is signed south–north, even though it travels much closer to an east-west direction. However, Mexican Federal Highway 57 travels south to Mexico City, so the unusual directional signing prevents confusion.

<text>Piracicaba ( or ) is a city located in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. The population is 423,323 (2022) in an area of 1,378.07 km2. It is at an elevation of 547 m above sea level.

==Name==
The place name comes from a word in the Tupi language that means &quot;place where the fish stops&quot;, and it is formed by the junction of the terms &quot;pirá&quot; (&quot;fish&quot;), &quot;syk&quot; (&quot;stop&quot;) and &quot;aba&quot; (&quot;place&quot;).
The name refers to the waterfalls of the Piracicaba River, which bisects the city, which is a point where the &quot;piracema&quot;—fish swimming upstream to reproduce— are stopped.

==History==

In 1766, Antonio Correa Barbosa, charged with the task of establishing a settlement on the estuary of Piracicaba river, opted for a location about from it. The settlement was officially founded on August 1, 1767, as a &quot;povoação&quot; subordinated to the &quot;vila of&quot; Itu. In 1784, Piracicaba got emancipated from Itu, becoming a &quot;freguesia.&quot;

In 1821, the freguesia was promoted to &quot;vila&quot;, known as Vila Nova da Constituição. In 1856, Vila Nova da Constituição was promoted to city status and in 1877 it was officially named &quot;Piracicaba&quot;, following a law by the then councilman and future Brazilian president Prudente de Morais.&quot; &quot;

In 1944, the city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Piracicaba.

==Notable institutions, events, resources==

Piracicaba is home to the oldest agricultural university in Brazil, the Luiz de Queiroz School of Agriculture of the University of São Paulo. Founded in 1901, the school is located on a farm with a large collection of trees and plants. It is also recognized as a leader in the field of precision agriculture. Other universities based in Piracicaba are the Methodist University of Piracicaba (UNIMEP) and the University of Campinas&#x27; School of Dentistry.

Piracicaba is known by the nickname &quot;Noiva da Colina&quot;, meaning &quot;Bride of the Hill&quot;, and is the annual host to the &quot;Festa das Nações&quot; (Nations&#x27; Party, where people may find foods from all over the world), and to the &quot;Salão Internacional do Humor&quot; (International Humor Exhibition), where cartoonists from around the world display comic drawings.

Piracicaba is famous for its sugarcane plantations, traditional cachaça production, and traditional music.

==Economy==
The city is an important and traditional producer of sugarcane. The harvest of sugarcane allows for the production of many derivates, including sugar, oil, and ethanol. Copersucar, a large company that has a center of research on genetic improvement of sugarcane, participates in this growing industry.

Another characteristic economic feature is the presence of large industries, the main ones being Caterpillar, ArcelorMittal, Raizen and Hyundai.

<doc id="514219" wikidata="Q3143019" url="?curid=514219" title="Hull Kingston Rovers">
<text>Hull Kingston Rovers (often abbreviated to Hull KR) are a professional rugby league club based in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, England. The club play home games at Craven Park and compete in Super League, the top tier of British rugby league.

Hull KR have won the League Championship five times and Challenge Cup once.

Hull Kingston Rovers are one of two professional rugby league teams in Hull. Hull F.C. play on the west side of the city, and Hull KR on the east side, at Hull College Craven Park. The River Hull is the divide between the two. Hull KR&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Robins&quot;, originates from their traditional playing colours of red and white.

After a ten-year stay in the Super League (2007–2016), they were relegated to the Championship in the 2016 season, due to the Million Pound Game. In the 2017 Championship season, Hull KR successfully gained automatic promotion back to the Super League, at the first time of asking.

==History==

===19th century===
Hull Kingston Rovers began in 1882 when a group of apprentice boilermakers in the Hessle Road area of Hull came together to start a team, Kingston Amateurs. Their first ground was a piece of wasteland in Albert Street, the club started playing in the Hull and District League in the autumn of 1883. By 1885 Kingston Amateurs had played at three grounds, Albert Street, Anlaby Road and finally Chalk Lane. The club name was also changed to Kingston Rovers as they entered the Times Cup in the 1885–86 season.
A number of clubs joined the league and the club entered the new Hull and District Rugby Union Cup, losing to Hull A in the final. The club won its first trophy in the 1887–88 season by winning the Times Cup, beating Selby A in the final. The Hull Kingston Rovers moved to their fourth ground, down Hessle Road.

In 1888–89, 6,000 fans turned up to the cup game against Hull A at the Holderness Road ground, which ended as a draw. Rovers went through the next season losing just two games, defeating Britannia in the Times Cup final.

Rovers beat Hull A for the first time in 1889–90, and moved to their fifth ground, again down Hessle Road. The Red and Whites won the Times Cup for the third year running in 1891–92 beating York A in the final. 1892 saw Rovers play at the Boulevard for the first time and they leased the ground for three years from the following season. Only one away win was recorded this season and six home wins, but Rovers entered the Yorkshire Cup for the first time although they were knocked out by Dewsbury in the second round. In 1893 Rovers played out of the Boulevard, and they lost to Bradford Northern that season in the first round of the Yorkshire Cup. Amos Law, a drop kicker joined the club from Cleckheaton and Huddersfield, while George William Lofthouse played at the age of 14; the youngest ever player to turn out for the senior side.

In 1895 the Northern Football Union was founded, when the leading rugby union sides in the North of England broke away to form a league of their own, comprising 22 clubs. Rovers, then nicknamed &quot;the redbreasts&quot; did not join the new organisation and were instead promoted to the second division of the RFU finishing joint second. They moved to their first ground in East Hull in Craven Street off Holderness Road. In 1896–97, they were denied a place in the first division when several sides resigned but when the West Riding club dropped out, Rovers moved up.

Hull KR amalgamated with Albany Soccer Club. After a successful amalgamation the clubs resources they then went onto win the Yorkshire Cup for the first time beating Shipley 11–5 in the final. The club also won the league competition and beat the rest of the league 26–8 in a challenge match. Rovers applied to join the Northern Union and played their first match under the new code in 1897–98.

Rovers were elected into the inaugural Yorkshire Second competition in 1898–99 winning all 17 matches. A club record of 19 consecutive league play-off and cup wins was set in that season with the club subsequently defeating Heckmondwike in a promotion/relegation match to qualify for the Yorkshire Senior Competition. Hull Kingston Rovers were thus admitted into full membership of the Yorkshire Northern Union and finished 6th out of 16 beating Hull 8–2 in the first local derby on 16 September 1899, in front of a 14,000 crowd.

=== Early 20th century ===
In 1901–02, the top Yorkshire clubs formed their own &#x27;super league&#x27; and Rovers played in the Lancashire League finishing 5th out of 13. Hull Kingston Rovers were one of the new teams to join the second division and finished joint second.

In 1904–05, Rovers reached the Challenge Cup Final losing 0–6 to Warrington in front of a crowd of 19,638. In the first round on 4 March 1905, Rovers beat Brookland Rovers 73–5 with G.H. &#x27;Tich&#x27; West scoring 53 of the points with 11 tries and 10 goals, still a club and world rugby league record. In 1906/07 they reached the final of the Yorkshire Cup only to lose to Bradford F.C. 5–8.

In 1908, Rovers gained a memorable 21–16 win over the first touring Australian side. In 1911/12 they finished 3rd out of 27 but lost 10–22 to Huddersfield in the final of the Yorkshire Cup. In 1912/13 Rovers finished 3rd again out of 26 clubs and lost to Wigan in the Championship semi final play-off and finished runners-up in the Yorkshire League Championship.

Leagues were suspended in 1915 due to the First World War. When an official regional league resumed on 18 January 1919, Rovers finished 19th out of 25. In 1920/21, Rovers finished top of the Rugby League but lost 14–16 to Hull F.C. in the play-off final at Headingley. They had their revenge in the Yorkshire Cup final beating Hull 2–0 to win their first cup as a professional side.

Rovers then moved to their second ground in East Hull, Old Craven Park, behind the tram and bus depot on the eastern end of Holderness Road in 1922. The land cost £18,281 and included 14 tennis courts. They lost their first match at the new ground 0-0-0 to 0–1–3 Wakefield Trinity on 2 September 1922, Albert Rosenfeld scoring Trinity&#x27;s try. The club finished 4th out of 27 in the league and they won the League Championship Cup beating Huddersfield 15–5. In season 1923/4 Gilbert Austin voluntarily ended a run of 190 consecutive appearances when he was selected to play for Yorkshire, which he considered a great honour.

1924–25 saw Rovers finish 2nd in the league, win the League Championship Cup, the Yorkshire League Cup, were semi-finalists in the Yorkshire Cup and runners-up in the Challenge Cup final. In 1925/26 Rovers finished 6th and won the Yorkshire League Championship. In 1926/27 the club finished 6th out of 29 but managed to beat a touring New Zealand side 20–15.

In 1929–30 Rovers won the Yorkshire Cup beating Hunslet 13–7 in the final, and finished 6th in the league. In 1933/34 the club lost 4–10 to York F.C. in the Yorkshire Cup Final.

Hull Kingston Rovers sold Craven Park for £10,750 to the Greyhound Racing Company in 1938 due to financial difficulties, securing a 21-year lease to continue playing there.

===Post-Second World War===
Leagues were again suspended during the Second World War. When the league resumed in 1945 Rovers finished 18th out of 27. Between 1947 and 1957, Rovers finished between 17th and 29th in the league. Colin Hutton was Hull KR coach from 1957 to 1970. In 1958 the club&#x27;s fortunes started improving, finishing 18th out of 30. In 1959–60 the club finished 13th out of 30, the first time the club had finished in the top half of the table since 1930–31 – the players shared a bonus of £500 to share.

In 1961–62, the club won 17 successive matches and finished 8th out of 30. In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Huddersfield and Hull Kingston Rovers met at Headingley, Leeds in the first final of the Eastern Division Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962. Reigning champions, Huddersfield were favourites to lift the Eastern Division title, especially as Rovers were missing five first choice players with injuries. The Robins, however, set the early pace and were 10–0 up after 30 minutes. Despite a rally by Huddersfield, Rovers hung on to win 13–10. Rovers win was their first trophy for more than 30 years. In 1962–63 as two division rugby returned, they finished the season tenth out of sixteen in Division 1.

In 1963–64, Rovers reached the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley for the first time, losing 5–13 to Widnes in front of 84,488 fans. A return to Division One rugby was made in 1964–65 when Rovers finished 8th out of 30. In 1965/66 Rovers finished 12th out of 30. Rovers finished second in 1966–67, their highest place for over 40 years and the Yorkshire Cup was won with a 25–12 victory over Featherstone Rovers.

The club bought Roger Millward from Castleford on 8 August 1966 for the sum of £6,000. Rovers won the Mackeson Trophy for being the top points scorers in the Rugby League. Rovers won the Yorkshire Cup for the second year running in 1967–68, beating Hull 8–7 in the final; the first all-Hull final in 47 years. The club finished third in the league and lost 10–17 to Wakefield Trinity in the play-off final; Rovers were runners-up in the Yorkshire League and beat the Australians 27–15 with Millward scoring a hat-trick.

===The 1970s===
Johnny Whiteley joined Hull Kingston Rovers as coach in 1970 and stayed until 1972.

In the early 1970s Hull KR purchased a site at Winchester Avenue with the aim of building a new stadium. The plans never came to fruition and the site was later sold to a private developer. The profit made from this land was used to buy back Craven Park with greyhound racing continuing as a subsidiary concern.

New Zealand visited Craven Park on 8 September 1971. The Kiwis, playing their third game in five days, were unable to match the Robins, who beat the Kiwis 12–10.

Rovers won a further two Yorkshire Cup winners medals in 1971/72 and 1974/75. In 1973/74 the club was relegated to Division 2 when they finished 14 out of 16 in Division 1. Rovers gained promotion back to Division 1 the next year and won the Yorkshire Cup for the sixth time beating Wakefield Trinity 16–13 in the final. They also reached the semi-finals of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy, the John Player Trophy and the Premiership Trophy. In 1975/76 the club were runners-up in the Yorkshire Cup losing 11–15 to Leeds.

Coach Harry Poole died in 1976/77, and Millward took over as temporary player-coach and in his first season guided the club to their first ever BBC2 Floodlit Trophy victory as the Robins beat St. Helens 26–11. The club finished 4th out of 16 in the league.

Phil Hogan was transferred to Hull KR in 1978 for a then world record fee of £35,000. Rovers topped the league for the first time since 1925. In 1979/80, under coach Roger Millward, Hull KR achieved a famous defeat of neighbours Hull, by a margin of 10–5 in the final of the Challenge Cup, at Wembley in front of 95,000 fans. A makeshift sign was left on the A63 (the major westerly road out of Hull) that read &quot;last one out turn the lights off!&quot; due to most of the city travelling to Wembley for the final. Also, a &#x27;10–5&#x27; bar is now situated inside Craven Park.

Steve Hubbard scored nine out of the ten points for Rovers. Millward played the full game, despite having his jaw broken early in the game. Earlier in the same season, Rovers had lost in the final of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy against Hull.

===1980s and early 1990s===
In 1980/81, Millward retired as a player after having his jaw broken for the third time, the club finished 3rd in the league but lost 18–9 to Widnes in the final of the Challenge Cup in front of 94,496. Rovers lost in the final of the Yorkshire Cup 7–8 to Leeds but won the Premiership Trophy beating Hull 11–7. International full back George Fairbairn was signed from Wigan suring the summer of 1981 for a then world record fee of £72.500. In 1981/82 Rovers finished 4th in the league and lost in the final of the John Player Trophy 4–12 against Hull.

In 1982/83 Rovers finished as runners-up in the league. In 1983/84 Rovers were crowned champions of the 1st Division and went on to win the Divisional Premiership beating Castleford 18–10 in the final at Headingley; becoming the first team to win the Championship / Premiership double. In 1984–85 they nearly repeated the feat winning the Division 1 Championship but narrowly missing out in the final of the Premiership. Rovers also won the John Player Trophy beating Hull 12–0 in the final at Boothferry Park but lost 12–29 to Hull in the final of the Yorkshire Cup.

On 25 August 1985, professional rugby league was played for the first time on the Isle of Man. The Charity Shield between Hull Kingston Rovers and Challenge Cup winners Wigan drew a crowd of 4,066 to the Douglas Bowl. The final score was 34–6 to Wigan.

In 1985/86, Millward took Rovers to their sixth win in the Yorkshire Cup before they were defeated in the John Player Final and the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley narrowly losing 15–14 to Castleford. This proved to be Rovers last major final to date, as the team that had part dominated the English game faded away.

By the late 1980s, time had taken its toll on Craven Park stadium, following the Bradford City stadium fire, capacity was restricted and the cost of safety work spiraled. Major renovations were needed to bring it up to scratch. Large amounts of money were spent on the ground each year repairing sections but once one section was repaired another would fall into disrepair. In 1988/89, their last full season at Craven Park, Rovers were relegated to the 2nd Division and Millward decided to stand down as coach. Wright Properties Ltd purchased Craven Park from the club and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.

A new stadium, New Craven Park, was built on a site off Preston Road. New Craven Park was officially opened on Sunday 24 September 1989 as Rovers beat Trafford Borough 48–8 in front of 8,500 spectators. Rovers started the new era convincingly, and were crowned Second Division champions with promotion back to the top flight.

George Fairbairn was brought in as a player-coach in 1992 for a record fee of £72,500. In 1994/95, Rovers were relegated to the third division despite finishing mid table.

===1996–2006: Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. When the Super League competition had been proposed, it was suggested Hull Kingston Rovers should merge with Hull F.C. to form &#x27;Humberside&#x27; and compete in the Super League. This was resisted but despite finishing top of the Third Division, they were not promoted. As the sport in Britain entered a new era, it would be ten years before Rovers rose again to the top level of the game.

Rovers were again crowned champions of the now renamed Second Division in 1996 and were this time promoted to the First Division. Hull Kingston Rovers entered administration in January 1997, and, but for the diligence of administrator Edward Klemka and the fund-raising activity of the Hull Kingston Rovers Supporters Group, the 1997 season would almost certainly have been their last. On the field though, Rovers won the Challenge Cup plate in its only season, beating Hunslet at Wembley 60–14. Then, against all odds, they finished second in the division the following season.

Rovers finished second in the league in 1998, and came close to a Grand Final spot with a Super League spot at stake. The Robins were expected to go one better in 1999 and topped the table for most of the season before their run ended and the final six games saw them drop from first place to sixth, missing out on a play-off place. Disappointment followed the year after when the Robins finished in seventh place in the league after a mid-season collapse and exited the play-offs in the first round.

After being in Administration from 1997 an acceptable buyer for the club was finally found in 2000, and the club came out of administration. Don Robinson took control in 2001 and Gary Wilkinson became head coach. Despite reaching the National Cup Final and finishing fourth in the league, Wilkinson made way for the club&#x27;s first overseas coach, Steve Linnane.

Under Linnane, the Robins came within eighty minutes of their first Grand Final appearance in 2002, after a largely successful end to the season, while the arrival of former player Nick Halafihi as chief executive, boosted the club&#x27;s off-field activities.

In 2004 the club appointed Mal Reilly as Director of Rugby and Martin Hall as first team coach after Steve Linnane&#x27;s resignation. But Reilly left the club midway through the season, while Hall took the club to the play-off semi-final before leaving once the season had finished. Halafihi also left the club.

Harvey Howard was appointed first team coach and Paul Lakin appointed chief executive in late 2004. Howard was dismissed shortly before the Northern Rail Cup Final, which Rovers went on to win 18–16 over Castleford, with the Robins utilising the temporary player-coaching abilities of James Webster.

Permanently taking over from Howard was the former Toulouse coach, Justin Morgan. October 2005 who saw the club still in the National League, after failing to get past the semi-final stage of the National League One play-offs. Rovers also started a number of ground improvements, including the laying of a new pitch, and widening of the playing surface. They also made some significant signings for the 2006 season.

Up to that time unbeaten in their 2006 fixtures, in early June they were drawn to meet Super League side Warrington, in the quarter-final of the Challenge Cup. It was arguably their biggest fixture for some years. Against all the odds the Robins won, 40–36, their best result in the competition since their 1980 Challenge Cup win against local rivals Hull. This result also created a new club record of 18 consecutive wins. The victory set up a semi final tie against Super League leaders, St. Helens.

Rovers also progressed to the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the second successive season, against Leigh at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool on 16 July. Leigh won this game 22–18, thus ending Rovers&#x27; twenty four match unbeaten run. The club&#x27;s Challenge Cup campaign also came to an abrupt halt, Rovers gamely succumbing 50–0 to triple-winning St Helens at the Galpharm Stadium, Huddersfield.

September 2006 saw Rovers crowned National League One Minor Premier winners, and qualify for an automatic place in the National League One play-off semi final at Craven Park against Widnes whom they beat 29–22 to reach the first Grand Final in their history, which they won 29–16, earning a place in the following season&#x27;s Super League competition.

===2007–2014: Super League===
After close-season signings and an overseas training camp, Rovers made a better than expected start to their first Super League campaign, winning their first two games – Wakefield Trinity at home and Huddersfield away. After suffering a reversal to Harlequins RL, they then had an away win (26–16) at Wigan, followed by a hard-fought victory at home to in-form Leeds, to go joint top of the early season table. However, inconsistent form, injuries and the effects of the first Super League sending-off (after 96 games) saw Rovers slip to near the bottom, despite a historic double away win over Wigan, and beating local rivals Hull at the Millennium Magic weekend. Improved late season results, including the safety-clinching win in the derby against Hull by the shock margin of 6–42 (played at the KC Stadium), ensured Super League status for another campaign.

Hull KR made significant changes to their squad for the 2008 season, which saw eleven new players brought in and a number of players released or sold. On 2 May the club announced that former captain James Webster had been released from the final six months of his contract due to a three to four-month lay off with a shoulder injury. He was replaced by new signing Michael Dobson, who was formerly a target of Hull. Canberra Raiders scrum half took squad number 26, and made his début against Harlequins RL on 25 May, scoring two tries. Rovers finished one point away from a play-off place.

2009 saw further consolidation of Hull KR&#x27;s Super League status with away victories at St Helens, Wigan and Warrington in a seven match winning run, taking Rovers briefly to the top position in the table. A less successful spell followed, due to inconsistency, injuries and international calls, but by mid August 2009 Rovers were fourth in the table, five points clear of the next placed side.

2011 saw the end of Justin Morgan&#x27;s reign as head coach and the club appointed Craig Sandercock as the new head coach for the 2012 season. Finishing 10th in his first season as a head coach and then making the play-offs in 2013, finishing 8th.

Despite making several big name signings for the 2014 season, Rovers failed to make any kind of impact in the league and with 8 games remaining they parted company with Sandercock, appointing assistant coach and ex-player Chris Chester as the new First-team coach of Hull KR. Chester could not steer the club to a playoff spot in his first 8 games in charge and they finished the season in 9th position.

===2015–present: Challenge Cup final and first Super League Grand Final===
Chester took charge of his first full season as Hull Kingston Rovers Head Coach in 2015 and despite a mass clearout of the 2014 squad, he made several high-profile signings, notably, Ken Sio, Albert Kelly, Maurice Blair, Terry Campese, Mitch Allgood, Ryan Bailey and Darrell Goulding.

The club&#x27;s first major final in 29 years ended in a record defeat along with the highest losing margin in a Challenge Cup final against Leeds by 50 points to nil.

Chester was sacked on 24 February 2016 just three matches into the 2016 season (two losses and a draw). James Webster took the reins, and led the Robins to four defeats in the following five games; the club also suffered a shock cup loss to Championship side Oldham R.L.F.C., as well as relegation to the Kingstone Press Championship in the 2016 Million Pound Game.

In September 2016, it was announced that Tim Sheens would be coaching the club for the next three years. In his first season, Rovers were promoted without having to play the Million Pound Game.

Over the next three seasons, Hull KR finished 10th, 11th and 11th. In the 2020 Super League season, the club only avoided relegation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Toronto&#x27;s expulsion from the league.

In the 2021 Super League season, Hull KR were predicted to fight against relegation after finishing the previous season on the bottom of the table. The club however finished in sixth place and qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2013. In the elimination playoff against Warrington, Hull KR produced a major upset winning the game 19–0 and booking their place in the semi-final against Catalans Dragons.
In the 2021 semi-final, Hull KR lost the match 28–10 at a sold out Stade Gilbert Brutus.

Hull Kingston Rovers started the 2022 Super League season looking to build on the events of 2021. Midway through the year however, head coach Tony Smith announced he would be leaving at the end of the year. In May 2022, Hull KR reached the semi-final of the Challenge Cup were defeated by Huddersfield at Elland Road. In July 2022, Smith left Hull Kingston Rovers after a humiliating loss to Toulouse Olympique and he was replaced by interim head coach Danny McGuire. Hull Kingston Rovers would finish the year in 8th place on the table. In the 2023 Super League season, the club finished fourth on the table and qualified for the playoffs. They defeated Leigh in the elimination playoff to reach the semi-final against Wigan. Wigan would defeat Hull Kingston Rovers 42–12. The club also reached the final of the 2023 Challenge Cup but were defeated by Leigh in extra-time.

Hull KR finished second in the 2024 Super League table and reached their first Grand Final by defeating Warrington Wolves 10–8 in the play-off semi-finals. In the grand final, Hull Kingston Rovers would fall short of winning their first piece of silverware in 39 years losing 9–2 against Wigan.

==Stadium==

===1895–1922: Craven Street===

Hull KR first played on Craven Street in 1895 and played there until 1922 when they built and developed a bigger stadium at Old Craven Park with better facilities.

===1922–1989: Old Craven Park===

Hull KR moved to Craven Park from their cramped Craven Street ground in 1922. The club purchased and developed a site behind the tram and bus depot on the eastern end of Holderness Road and it hosted its first game on 2 September 1922. Craven Park also hosted greyhound racing. Hull Kingston Rovers sold the ground to the Greyhound Racing Company in 1930s due to financial difficulties, securing a long-term lease to continue playing there.

In the early 1970s Hull Kingston Rovers purchased a site at Winchester Avenue with the aim of building a new stadium there. These plans never came to fruition and the site was later sold to a private developer. The profit made from this land was used to buy back Craven Park with greyhound racing continuing as a subsidiary concern. Following the Bradford City stadium fire, capacity was restricted and costs of safety work spiraled. With the club in debt the ground was sold to developers and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.

===1989–present: Craven Park===
The club moved to the new ground in 1989 from the &quot;Old&quot; Craven Park which was sited on Holderness Road. The first match was played against Trafford Borough packing in a full capacity 8,500 crowd to watch.

In 2006 the ground and pitch were substantially improved as the club sought a return to the top flight of English rugby league. On 25 January 2014, Hull Kingston Rovers announced that it had secured a new stadium naming rights partnership with local communications provider, KC. Under a five-year agreement, Craven Park was renamed the KC Lightstream Stadium. After a corporate rebrand, the stadium was renamed again as KCOM Craven Park. In 2019 it was renamed the Hull College Craven Park Stadium.

A further renaming deal was signed in January 2022 when Hull-based company, Sewell Group, signed a two-year deal for rights to the stadium naming. The stadium to be known as the Sewell Group Craven Park.

On 28 March 2022 the club announced that they had purchased the ground from Kingston Community Developments Ltd (KCDL). KCDL had been the club&#x27;s landlord since the 1990s. The club also announced that they have the option to buy up to of land surrounding the ground from Hull City Council.

In 2021, Hull KR defeated Dewsbury Moor Ladies in the League 1 Grand Final to earn promotion to the Championship and in November it was announced that the team, which had until that time been supported by the Hull KR Community Trust, was to become integrated into the club&#x27;s structure. In 2022, the team reached the semi-finals of the League Cup by defeating Hull FC in the first derby fixture between the two sides. They had previously been due to face each other in the cancelled 2020 Challenge Cup. In the 2023 season, Hull KR suffered a 122–0 defeat to York Valkyrie in the group stage of Challenge Cup, but then won the League Cup with a 22–6 win over Stanningley in the final. They also finished top of the Championship and defeated Oulton Raidettes 30–16 in the Grand Final but were denied the opportunity for promotion due to the restructuring of the national pyramid in 2024. In January 2024, it was announced that they would be in the 2024 Northern Women&#x27;s Championship.

<text>Caroline Mary Aherne (24 December 1963 – 2 July 2016) was an English actress, comedian, writer and director. She was best known for performing as the acerbic chat show host &quot;Mrs Merton&quot;, in various roles in &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, and as Denise in &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2012), a series which she co-wrote. She won BAFTA awards for her work on &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot; and &quot;The Royle Family&quot;.

Aherne narrated the Channel 4 reality television series &quot;Gogglebox&quot; from its inception in 2013 until 8 April 2016. She died of cancer at the age of 52.

==Early life==
Aherne was born in Ealing, London, on 24 December 1963, the second child of Irish parents Bartholomew Edmond &quot;Bert&quot; Aherne, a railwayman with London Transport, and Mary Frances &quot;Maureen&quot; Aherne (&quot;née&quot; Regan). From the age of two, Aherne was brought up in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Like her brother Patrick, Aherne had retinoblastoma in childhood, which left her partially sighted in one eye.

She attended the Hollies Convent FCJ School in West Didsbury, Xaverian College in Rusholme in Manchester and then studied drama at Liverpool Polytechnic.

==Career==
===Early career===
Aherne began performing on the Manchester comedy circuit as characters such as Mitzi Goldberg, lead singer of the comedy country and western act the Mitzi Goldberg Experience, and Sister Mary Immaculate, an Irish nun.

The Mrs Merton character originated as a voice on the 1988 Frank Sidebottom album titled &quot;5:9:88&quot;, after Aherne worked as a receptionist for his show on Piccadilly Radio. Aherne was then invited by DJ Martin Kelner to develop the character on his show, where she would spend many years appearing as a comedy agony aunt across the north of England on the BBC Night Network.

In 1990 Aherne became a late night radio presenter on KFM Radio in Stockport, joining a line-up which included Craig Cash as well as Jon Ronson, Spence MacDonnald and &quot;The Word&quot;&#x27;s Terry Christian.

Aherne&#x27;s first TV appearances were as Mrs Merton in a semi-regular spot on the Granada TV discussion show &quot;Upfront&quot; in 1990. After that Mrs Merton became the regular celebrity interviewer on Granada&#x27;s Saturday morning show &quot;Express!&quot;, a youth TV programme presented by I Am Kloot&#x27;s John &#x27;Johnny Dangerously&#x27; Bramwell and Sumy Kuraishe from a number of random locations in the north west. In 1992 Aherne appeared as Mrs Merton in the local Yorkshire Television series &quot;Frank&#x27;s Fantastic Shed Show&quot;, with Chris Sievey in his Frank Sidebottom persona. For this Leeds-based ITV station Aherne had recorded a pilot of &quot;Mrs Murton&#x27;s Nightcap&quot;, but they had not pursued the concept. In 1993, she made brief appearances in &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; and alongside Steve Coogan and John Thomson in a Granada TV pilot entitled &quot;The Dead Good Show&quot;.

She rose to prominence in 1994 as her created character Mrs Merton on the mock chat show &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot; under her married name of Caroline Hook. The guests were real-life celebrities, not actors, who found themselves the subject of outrageous &quot;faux-naïf&quot; questions – in one memorable example the wife of magician Paul Daniels, Debbie McGee, was asked &quot;So, what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?&quot; – while a regular audience of pensioners were used each week for Mrs Merton to bounce questions off.

Another episode featured comedian Bernard Manning and actor Richard Wilson. Manning clashed with Wilson and Aherne as she asked him about his racist attitudes, at one point saying, &quot;Who do you vote for now Hitler&#x27;s dead?&quot; – although he acknowledged that &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; was funny. The series ran in various formats from 1994 to 1997, winning a BAFTA for Best Talk Show in 1997. The success of the show was partly attributed to the &quot;round vowel sounds of the North West accent&quot; which &quot;naturally sound safe and unthreatening&quot; and which allowed the character &quot;to ask the most outrageous, below-the-belt questions of her guest stars&quot;.

The Mrs Merton character was given a sitcom, &quot;Mrs Merton and Malcolm&quot;, which depicted her home life with her &quot;mummy&#x27;s boy&quot; son (played by co-writer Craig Cash). This aspect of Malcolm&#x27;s character was exaggerated to the point that many complained the series ridiculed those with learning difficulties. &quot;Mrs Merton and Malcolm&quot; lasted one series, and was released on DVD in 2008.

Between 1994 and 2004 she appeared alongside Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson in &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, where her characters included &quot;Our Janine&quot;, a teenage mum with a unique world outlook; Renée, the endlessly chattering Northern wife of hen-pecked Roy; Checkout Girl, a simple and chatty young supermarket employee; and Chanel 9 meteorologist Poula Fisch, whose weather forecasts invariably included the word &quot;Scorchio!&quot;.

===&quot;The Royle Family&quot;===
Aherne&#x27;s most popular creation is the situation comedy &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, which she co-created and wrote with Cash, and directed in its third series. The programme ran for three series from 1998 to 2000. Aherne starred alongside Ricky Tomlinson and Sue Johnston, as their daughter Denise Royle. The show was a commercial and critical success, and ran for three series with a total of 20 episodes as well as five one-offs made for showing at Christmas. After a 2000 spoof documentary with Cash entitled &quot;Back Passage to India&quot;, Aherne said &quot;The Royle Family&quot; would end in December 2000 after a Christmas special, and that she would not appear on television again, although she would continue to write. Aherne received BAFTAs for Best Sitcom in 2000 and 2007, and she won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance in 2000. She was nominated for directing in 2001.

===Later career===
Following a disagreement with Cash, Aherne moved to Australia and retreated from the press. She wrote &quot;Dossa and Joe&quot; which was screened on BBC Two in 2002. Although critics applauded it, the show failed to attract viewers and did not return for a second series. Returning to Britain, she began work on another sitcom with Cash, but pulled out, after which Cash wrote &quot;Early Doors&quot; with Phil Mealey; Aherne was listed in the credits in the &quot;Thanks To&quot; section.

After &quot;Dossa and Joe&quot;, Aherne avoided media attention. When &quot;The Fast Show&quot; was featured on the BBC One show &quot;Comedy Connections&quot;, Aherne was the only cast member not interviewed. In April 2006, the BBC said Aherne and Cash were developing a script for a one-off special of &quot;The Royle Family&quot;. &quot;The Royle Family: The Queen of Sheba&quot; was broadcast on 29 October 2006, to an audience of 7.8 million. Aherne subsequently made few TV appearances. On 14 October 2008, she appeared in the BBC comedy drama &quot;Sunshine&quot;, written by Cash and Phil Mealey, as a barmaid. She appeared in &quot;The Royle Family&quot; special &quot;The New Sofa&quot; on Christmas Day 2008. In 2009, she appeared in another special for Comic Relief, as well as another Christmas Day special entitled &quot;The Golden Eggcup&quot;.

She co-wrote the ITV comedy-drama &quot;The Fattest Man in Britain&quot;, which was broadcast in December 2009. In November 2010, Aherne appeared in the special &quot;The Royle Family: Behind the Sofa&quot; shown on Gold, featuring clips of &quot;The Royle Family&quot; and interviews with Aherne, Cash and the cast, which was followed by another Christmas Day special, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Crackers&quot;. She narrated a BBC1 documentary series &quot;Pound Shop Wars&quot; broadcast in November 2012. She also appeared in &quot;The Fast Show&quot; internet specials, sponsored by the lager brand Fosters, which reunited most of the original principal cast; only Mark Williams was unable to participate.

Aherne wrote the 2013 one-off sitcom &quot;The Security Men&quot;, along with Jeff Pope for ITV. The episode starred Paddy McGuinness, Brendan O&#x27;Carroll, Dean Andrews, Bobby Ball and Peter Wight.

Aherne&#x27;s final major role was as narrator of the Channel 4 comedy reality series &quot;Gogglebox&quot;, reflecting her character in &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, who would frequently be watching TV and commenting on it. Cash filled in when she was unavailable and took over the role permanently in April 2016.

Aherne&#x27;s final on-screen appearance came in the Sky One show &quot;After Hours&quot;, where she was reunited with Cash who produced and directed the show. She played the role of Sheila.

==Personal life, illness and death==
Aherne was married to Peter Hook of the bands Joy Division and New Order from 1994 until 1997. During their marriage, he appeared in her TV series &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot; as leader of Hooky &amp; the Boys, the show&#x27;s house band. After her death, Hook said that he was repeatedly physically abused by Aherne during their marriage. Charities supporting victims of domestic violence welcomed his statements.

Aherne struggled with depression and alcoholism. She attempted suicide in July 1998 after the death of her former boyfriend, BBC technician Matt Bowers, from stomach cancer in 1997 and the end of a relationship with American actor Alexis Denisof. She checked in to the Priory, where she was diagnosed as a binge alcoholic.

She had suffered from bladder cancer and had been born with a rare cancer of the retina. In 2014, she also embarked on a programme of treatment for lung cancer. In June 2014, Aherne appeared in Manchester at the launch of the Macmillan Cancer Improvement Partnership (MCIP), a £3.4 million scheme to co-ordinate cancer care in the city. She spoke about how a sense of humour had helped her cope with the disease. In 2016, Aherne became the voice behind the UK government&#x27;s &quot;One You&quot; health campaign, to persuade people to cut down on cigarettes and alcohol.

On the morning of 2 July 2016, Aherne died of lung cancer at her home in Timperley aged 52. Aherne had told family and close friends in May that she was terminally ill. Her funeral took place on 14 July 2016. Many friends and co-stars were in attendance.

In October 2016, Steve Coogan paid tribute to Aherne at the Stand Up to Cancer 2016 event, speaking about her before a video was played of her TV moments, and then Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds performed &quot;The Royle Family&quot; theme tune &quot;Half the World Away&quot;.

<text>Die Fantastischen Vier (, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;), often shortened to Fanta 4, is a German hip hop band from Stuttgart. The members are Michael Schmidt (Smudo), Andreas Rieke, Thomas Dürr, and Michi Beck. They were, together with Advanced Chemistry, one of the earliest German-language rap groups.

==History==

In the mid-1980s, Rieke and Schmidt formed the &quot;Terminal Team&quot;, which Dürr and Beck joined in 1989. Under the new name &quot;Die Fantastischen Vier&quot; they made German hip hop, or &quot;Deutschen Sprechgesang&quot; &quot;(German spoken song)&quot; as they called it, popular in Germany. Although there were German hip-hop artists prior to them (such as Advanced Chemistry from Heidelberg), it was Die Fantastischen Vier who registered the first chart hit with their 1992 single &quot;Die da?!&quot; (Her?!) from the album &quot;4 gewinnt&quot;, hitting No. 2 in Germany and No. 1 in Austria and Switzerland.

After traveling to Los Angeles in the late 1980s, the group realized the lack of connection between the struggles of &quot;the poor blacks in the United States and middle-class whites in Germany&quot;, and made a conscious effort to move away from the typical and cliché American gangsta rap. The group never got involved with gangsta rap clichés, reacting with tongue-in-cheek humor to verbal attacks of alleged German &#x27;gangsta rappers&#x27;. In the albums following &quot;4 gewinnt&quot;, the band matured and progressed to a more serious and philosophic style.
In addition to the group&#x27;s works, Thomas D, Hausmarke, and Ypsilon also produced successful solo albums and the four had their own weekly show &quot;Die 4. Dimension&quot;, named after their third album, which aired on the German pay TV channel Premiere in 1993 and 1994.

At the 1996 Popkomm in Cologne, Die Fantastischen Vier announced the establishment of their label, Four Music. Headquarters were in Stuttgart, but were later moved to Berlin-Kreuzberg.

Three years later, the group&#x27;s seventh album &quot;4:99&quot; was released on their own label, with four singles from the album following. After the No. 2 hit &quot;MfG&quot;, three singles were released at the same time, a first in German music business. Each one can be associated with one of the rappers: &quot;Le Smou&quot; (Smudo), &quot;Michi Beck in Hell&quot; (Michi Beck), and &quot;Buenos Dias Messias&quot; (Thomas D).

In late September 2004, the group released the album &quot;Viel&quot;, the following tour being their most successful and best-attended to date.

In 2005, Fanta 4&#x27;s first greatest-hits album was published. It includes all singles, as well as several other songs and rare footage from the group&#x27;s early days, when they were still called Terminal Team and rapped in English.

On 7 April 2007, the number-one album &quot;Fornika&quot; was released, preceded by the single &quot;Ernten was wir säen&quot; &quot;(Reap what we sow)&quot;. &quot;Ernten was wir säen&quot; was released as a download for &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; in December 2007 and was covered by rock band Oomph! in 2009.
Die Fantastischen Vier are also the German voices of the Penguins (Michael Beck as Skipper, Thomas D. as Kowalski, Andreas Rieke as Rico and Michael Bernd Schmidt as Private) in the &quot;Madagascar&quot; film series.

In 2010, &quot;Für dich immer noch Fanta Sie&quot; peaked again at number one of the German charts.

The 2014 release of the album &quot;Rekord&quot; marked the 25th anniversary of the band. It also topped the charts in Germany.

In 2018, the single &quot;Zusammen&quot;, featuring Clueso, from the album &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, was chosen as the official song for the 2018 FIFA World Cup by German public broadcaster Das Erste.

<text>The Pierre Laporte Bridge (French: Pont Pierre-Laporte) is the longest main span suspension bridge in Canada. It crosses the Saint Lawrence River approximately west (upstream) of the Quebec Bridge between Quebec City and Lévis. It spans .

It was originally named the New Quebec Bridge (&quot;Nouveau pont de Québec&quot;) and was supposed to be called Pont Frontenac (Frontenac Bridge) until it was renamed in honour of Quebec Vice-Premier Pierre Laporte, who was kidnapped and murdered during the October Crisis of 1970 as construction of the bridge was nearing completion. The bridge was constructed for the Province of Quebec, Department of Roads in a joint venture with the private firm of Parsons Transportation Group.

It carries Autoroute 73 northbound from Autoroute 20, the Trans-Canada Highway, to Quebec City and Autoroute 40 and also northwards towards Saguenay.

<doc id="514231" wikidata="Q3954861" url="?curid=514231" title="Frequency-dependent selection">
<text>Frequency-dependent selection is an evolutionary process by which the fitness of a phenotype or genotype depends on the phenotype or genotype composition of a given population.
* In positive frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype or genotype increases as it becomes more common.
* In negative frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype or genotype decreases as it becomes more common. This is an example of balancing selection.
* More generally, frequency-dependent selection includes when biological interactions make an individual&#x27;s fitness depend on the frequencies of other phenotypes or genotypes in the population.

Frequency-dependent selection is usually the result of interactions between species (predation, parasitism, or competition), or between genotypes within species (usually competitive or symbiotic), and has been especially frequently discussed with relation to anti-predator adaptations. Frequency-dependent selection can lead to polymorphic equilibria, which result from interactions among genotypes within species, in the same way that multi-species equilibria require interactions between species in competition (e.g. where &quot;α&quot;ij parameters in Lotka-Volterra competition equations are non-zero). Frequency-dependent selection can also lead to dynamical chaos when some individuals&#x27; fitnesses become very low at intermediate allele frequencies.

==Negative==
The first explicit statement of frequency-dependent selection appears to have been by Edward Bagnall Poulton in 1884, on the way that predators could maintain color polymorphisms in their prey.

Perhaps the best known early modern statement of the principle is Bryan Clarke&#x27;s 1962 paper on apostatic selection (a form of negative frequency-dependent selection). Clarke discussed predator attacks on polymorphic British snails, citing Luuk Tinbergen&#x27;s classic work on searching images as support that predators such as birds tended to specialize in common forms of palatable species. Clarke later argued that frequency-dependent balancing selection could explain molecular polymorphisms (often in the absence of heterosis) in opposition to the neutral theory of molecular evolution.

Another example is plant self-incompatibility alleles. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population.

A similar example is the csd alleles of the honey bee. A larva that is homozygous at csd is inviable. Therefore rare alleles spread through the population, pushing the gene pool toward an ideal equilibrium where every allele is equally common.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is involved in the recognition of foreign antigens and cells. Frequency-dependent selection may explain the high degree of polymorphism in the MHC.

In behavioral ecology, negative frequency-dependent selection often maintains multiple behavioral strategies within a species. A classic example is the Hawk-Dove model of interactions among individuals in a population. In a population with two traits A and B, being one form is better when most members are the other form. As another example, male common side-blotched lizards have three morphs, which either defend large territories and maintain large harems of females, defend smaller territories and keep one female, or mimic females in order to sneak matings from the other two morphs. These three morphs participate in a rock paper scissors sort of interaction such that no one morph completely outcompetes the other two. Another example occurs in the scaly-breasted munia, where certain individuals become scroungers and others become producers.

==Positive==
Positive frequency-dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. A good example is warning coloration in aposematic species. Predators are more likely to remember a common color pattern that they have already encountered frequently than one that is rare. This means that new mutants or migrants that have color patterns other than the common type are eliminated from the population by differential predation. Positive frequency-dependent selection provides the basis for Müllerian mimicry, as described by Fritz Müller, because all species involved are aposematic and share the benefit of a common, honest signal to potential predators.

Another, rather complicated example occurs in the Batesian mimicry complex between a harmless mimic, the scarlet kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis elapsoides&quot;), and the model, the eastern coral snake (&quot;Micrurus fulvius&quot;), in locations where the model and mimic were in deep sympatry, the phenotype of the scarlet kingsnake was quite variable due to relaxed selection. But where the pattern was rare, the predator population was not &#x27;educated&#x27;, so the pattern brought no benefit. The scarlet kingsnake was much less variable on the allopatry/sympatry border of the model and mimic, most probably due to increased selection since the eastern coral snake is rare, but present, on this border. Therefore, the coloration is only advantageous once it has become common.

<text>Michael Thomas Hall (born 20 September 1952) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Weaver Vale from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
Mike Hall was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, and educated at St Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School and St Damian&#x27;s Catholic Secondary Modern School there. He studied at Padgate Training College, Warrington, where he was awarded a Certificate in Education in 1977. He later returned to the college and received a Bachelor of Education degree in 1987. He completed his studies at the University of Wales, Bangor, where he earned a Postgraduate diploma in education in 1989.

He joined Imperial Chemical Industries in Blackley, Manchester, in 1969 as a scientific laboratory assistant, leaving to go to university in 1973. He became a history and physical education teacher in 1977 in Bolton, where he remained until he became a support teacher with the Halton community assessment team from 1985 until his election to Parliament.

He joined the Labour Party in 1977 and was elected as a councillor to the Warrington Borough Council in 1979. He became Warrington&#x27;s deputy leader in 1984, and leader for seven years from 1985, before standing down in 1993. He was also elected to the Great Sankey Parish Council for four years from 1979. He served for four years on the Birchwood and Croft Parish Council from 1983.

==Parliamentary career==
Hall was elected to the House of Commons for Warrington South at the 1992 general election, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Chris Butler by just 191 votes. He made his maiden speech on 6 May 1992. Following boundary changes, at the 1997 general election, he moved from Warrington South to the newly created, nearby constituency of Weaver Vale, which covers Northwich, Frodsham and parts of Runcorn. He won this seat with a safe 13,448 majority, and continued to hold the seat comfortably, albeit with reduced majorities at each subsequent election.

In Parliament he served as a member of the Public Accounts Committee (1992–1997), and became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Leader of the House of Commons Ann Taylor following the 1997 General Election. He became a member of the Labour government, under Prime Minister Tony Blair, in 1998, when he was appointed as an Assistant Government Whip. He was sacked following the 2001 General Election. From 2001 to 2005 he served as PPS to the Secretary of State for Health, initially under Alan Milburn and, from 2003, his successor, John Reid. He has been a member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee since the 2005 General Election. From October 2008 onwards he was the PPS to Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary.

In May 2009, it was reported by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that he claimed expenses in excess of £15,000 over three years for cleaning products.

On 2 February 2010, Hall announced that he was standing down at the next general election for health reasons.

==Personal life==
He married Lesley Evelyn Gosling on 2 August 1975 in Ashton-under-Lyne and they have a son, Thomas.

In 2024, his daughter-in-law Sarah Hall was elected as the Member of Parliament in his old constituency Warrington South.

<doc id="514240" wikidata="Q275109" url="?curid=514240" title="Jundiaí">
<text>Jundiaí is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, in the Southeast Region of Brazil, located north of São Paulo. The population of the city is 443,221, with an area of 431.20 km².

The elevation is 761 m.
The GDP of the city is U$16.6 billion (R$36.6 billion). The budget for 2013 is U$787 million (R$1.63 billion), according to the official data of the City Hall.

== History and geography ==
The locally most-accepted history of the first non-native American colonizers of the locale were Rafael de Oliveira and Petronilha Rodrigues Antunes who fled São Paulo for political reasons and who in 1615 then founded what became known as the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Desterro (&quot;The Parish of Our Lady of the Landless&quot;).

The municipality was officially founded on December 14, 1655, when it was elevated to the category of village. Its first urbanization was carried out in 1657. Jundiaí has borders with Várzea Paulista, Campo Limpo Paulista, Franco da Rocha, Cajamar, Pirapora do Bom Jesus, Cabreúva, Itupeva, Louveira, Vinhedo, Itatiba and Jarinu.

Formerly spelled Jundiahy, the name of the town comes from the Tupi language, &quot;jundiá&quot; means &quot;fish with barbs&quot; (the &quot;Rhamdia quelen&quot; species) and &quot;í&quot; means river. Loosely translated, it means &quot;Catfish River.&quot;

The city received massive numbers of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and early 20th century, making most of the city&#x27;s inhabitants of Italian descent, which constitutes about 75% of the city&#x27;s population. Amongst other immigrant groups, there are: Portuguese, Spanish, German and small amounts of Hungarian and Slavic peoples.

Recently, Jundiaí has enjoyed a steep population growth, in large part fueled by a shift of residents from the megalopolis of São Paulo, seeking better living conditions.

== Agriculture ==
The region burst onto the national stage with the production of grapes, especially with the &quot;pink&quot; variety of the Niagara grape. To stimulate the production of grapes, with the support of the Associação Agrícola de Jundiaí e Prefeitura (Agriculture Association of Jundiaí and Town Hall), in 1934 Antenor Soares Gandra created the Festa da Uva (Grape Festival), not to be confused with a festival of the same name in Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul. Since 1964 the Festa da Uva is celebrated every even-numbered year, alternating with the Festa do Morango (Strawberry Festival) in the park Parque Comendador Antonio Carbonari but most known as the Parque da Uva (Grape Park).

The first Festa do Morango was in 1965 in the Poste neighborhood of the city. Later, because of the increase in agriculture participants and of the public interest, the event was transferred to the Parque Comendador Antonio Carbonari.

== Tourism ==
The Serra do Japi (Japi mountain range), situated southeast of the city, is a state park that has a natural reserve with one of the largest forested areas in the state of São Paulo, with beautiful landscapes and many opportunities for ecotourism, large hotel-farms and extreme sports.

The Jundiahy section is a historical area amongst the rivers Jundiai, Guapeva and Mato. It is an affluent neighborhood with fancy houses, gardens and a traditional small community business.

== Sports ==

Paulista is the city&#x27;s football (soccer) club. The team, which plays at Jayme Cintra Stadium, was the champion of Copa do Brasil 2005 (Cup of Brazil).

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Transportation ==

The Jundiaí Airport serves the city and region for small airplanes.
Jundiaí has a connection in the Jundiaí station with Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM).
It has a system of public transportation that costs R$5,00 (USD 0,97) for a one way ticket, as of 2023. Most of the buses have wheelchair lifts and a few have monitors that broadcast videos about the city and education. The lines are all connected by &quot;terminais&quot; (terminals), what makes the users&#x27; transportation faster and cheaper since there is free circulation in the terminals to the &quot;linhas alimentadoras&quot; (feeding lines), which carry the passengers from the terminals to their respective destinations . Regular users can register and use a yellow, reloadable electronic card. Students can register for a blue card that charges only half price for each ticket. The elderly or disabled can register for a grey or green card which allows free admittance.

<doc id="514251" wikidata="Q40706" url="?curid=514251" title="Paulínia">
<text>Paulínia is a Brazilian municipality in the interior of the state of São Paulo. It is located in the northwest of the São Paulo Macrometropolis and is about 119 km from the state capital. It occupies an area of 139 km2 and in 2018, IBGE estimated its population at 106,776. It was emancipated on 28 February 1964, but its foundation dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. The town is named after José Paulino Nogueira, a well-known farmer in the Campinas region, the municipality from which Paulínia emancipated and who lent his name to the railroad station around which the town developed. It is located in the Rio-São Paulo axis, serving as a link between Greater São Paulo and cities in the area, such as Cosmópolis, Artur Nogueira, and Conchal.

It is known for hosting one of the largest petrochemical poles in Latin America, centered on the Paulínia Refinery (Replan). Thanks to Replan and the petrochemical pole, which are based in the northern part of the city, Paulínia has the seventh highest per capita income in Brazil. Also due to the pole, the city presents high levels of ozone pollution, mainly in the district of Betel and in the Replan region, where companies such as Rhodia, Purina, Shell, Syngenta, and Petrobras are located. Paulínia stands out for its intense population growth, the largest in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. Historically, the service sector has not been very important for the municipality, but recently it has been developing because of projects like &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot; (English: Paulínia Magic of Cinema)&quot;.&quot;

Since 2019, Paulínia has had a new source of income and employment for the city and the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. The technology sector has been growing in Paulínia with the arrival of ASCENTY, a multinational company specialized in the field of &quot;Data Centers&quot;, with data processing centers and branches in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Colombia, thus opening the door for the arrival of two other companies in the city, CloudHQ and Amazon.

The municipality is formed by the city of Paulínia and the district of Betel, in the eastern region. Paulínia is part of the so-called Extended Metropolitan Complex, which exceeds 29 million inhabitants, approximately 75% of the population of the entire state of São Paulo. The metropolitan regions of Campinas and São Paulo already form the first megalopolis in the southern hemisphere, uniting 65 municipalities that together are home to 12% of the Brazilian population.

== Etymology ==

The term Paulínia pays homage to José Paulino Nogueira, a farmer from Campineiro, one of the owners of Funil farm, located between the present-day cities of Paulínia and Cosmópolis. The village that gave rise to the city of Paulínia was called José Paulino Village until 1944, when a state decree prohibited localities from having names of living people. Due to this fact, the village was elevated to a district with the name &quot;Paulínia&quot;.

José Paulino was born on 13 February 1853, in Campinas. At the end of the Empire, as a member of the Republican Party of São Paulo, he was elected an alderman in his hometown, alongside Júlio de Mesquita and Salvador Penteado. In March 1889, when there was an outbreak of yellow fever in Campinas, José Paulino was one of the few authorities who did not abandon the city; he fought the disease and became loved by the people of Campinas. At the end of the 19th century, Paulino and his brothers started to clear the way for Funil farm, between Paulínia and Cosmópolis. With the construction of the Funilense Railroad, a railroad station was also built in the São Bento neighborhood, which became known as José Paulino. The small neighborhood of São Bento grew up around the station and also became known as José Paulino. Due to the decree that prohibited names of living people in localities, upon its elevation to district José Paulino was renamed Paulínia.

==History==
Paulínia&#x27;s history begins long before its emancipation, which occurred in 1964; it goes back to the beginning of the 16th century, with the beginning of the occupation of the Campinas region.

=== Origins ===
During the 18th century, the region of Campinas began to be occupied due to the passage of the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; routes that headed for the gold mines in the interior of Brazil. The settlement began more precisely in the period between 1739 and 1744, when Captain Francisco Barreto Leme do Prado arrived at the then parish of &quot;Nossa Senhora de Conceição de Campinas&quot;.

The history of Paulínia as an urban agglomeration begins with the donation of &quot;sesmarias&quot; by the Portuguese government. There are reports of the donation of two large &quot;sesmarias&quot; in the region of the Atibaia and Jaguari rivers, where the city of Paulínia is located today, one in 1796 and another, called the Morro Azul &quot;sesmaria&quot;, in 1807. From the latter originated the São Bento farm, acquired by Comendador Francisco de Paula Camargo, and the Funil farm; both have a great connection with the establishment of Paulínia. Officially Paulínia was founded on 16 July 1906, by José Seixas de Queiroz; however, the city&#x27;s anniversary is celebrated on the date the municipality was created, 28 February.

Paulínia&#x27;s population was formed mainly by Italian immigrants, who replaced the slaves that worked on the farms after the abolition of slavery in 1888. However, with the economic growth, the city has become a destination for many immigrants from neighboring cities and other parts of Brazil, especially from the Northeast, who are looking for work or better living conditions.

=== From village to district ===

The first urban center in the region of Paulínia was a village called São Bento where, in 1903, a chapel was inaugurated in honor of the same saint, which had begun to be built in 1897, the same year in which the plans and budget for the José Paulino station were approved. Around this chapel the São Bento neighborhood began to develop. At this time São Bento was a suburb of Campinas.

Due to the expansion of the agricultural culture, the farmers of the region started to feel difficulties in draining their production due to the presence of the Atibaia and Jaguari rivers, which made it difficult for them to cross with the products. In this context, the producers started to demand from the captaincy of São Paulo the construction of a railroad that would make it possible to transport their production to other centers. In 1880 credits were approved for the construction of the Companhia Carril Agrícola Funilense, connecting the city of Campinas to the region of Funil farm.

The inauguration of the carriage section of the Funilense Railroad, on 18 September 1899, changed the economic order of the São Bento neighborhood. The José Paulino Station attracted many merchants to the neighborhood and gave rise to José Paulino Village, the result of the development of the São Bento neighborhood. Around the station there was Comércio Street, later renamed José Paulino Avenue, and a replica of the chapel of the São Bento farm, the São Bento Church, which still exists today. On 30 November 1944, through Decree-Law 14334, José Paulino was elevated to a district with the name Paulínia.

=== From district to municipality ===
Paulínia remained a district of Campinas for twenty years. During this period the agricultural and industrial development reached the whole region, mainly with the installation of Rhodia in São Francisco farm in 1942. This fact represented an increase in tax collection for Campinas. In the mid-1950s, a retired employee from the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo, José Lozano Araújo, founded the Friends of Paulínia association and started a movement for the emancipation of Paulínia. The movement culminated with the holding of a plebiscite on 6 November 1963, which determined emancipation. On 28 February 1964, Law 8092 was published, creating the town of Paulínia.

The first elections took place on 7 March 1965, and José Lozano Araújo was elected. He was responsible for major works in the city and for the installation of Replan on the site, as he donated the land and exempted it from taxes for twenty years. The refinery transformed Paulínia into a population attraction center, growing from 6,900 inhabitants in 1972 to 28,620 in 1973, tripling the number of inhabitants.

=== Economic Growth ===

The first industrial unit to be installed where Paulínia is today was Rhodia, in 1942. For years it was the main industry in the city, initially focused on agro-industrial production and later transformed into a chemical industry. In 1968, General Arthur Duarte Candal Fonseca, president of Petrobras, announced the construction of an oil refinery in Paulínia. Construction began on 28 February 1969, on the five-year anniversary of emancipation, and the refinery was inaugurated on 12 May 1972. The president of Brazil, General Emílio Garrastazu Médici, the president of Petrobras, Ernesto Geisel, and the head of the military cabinet of the presidency, General João Batista de Oliveira Figueiredo were present at the ceremony.

Replan has attracted thousands of immigrants to Paulínia, as well as other companies, which have transformed the town into the largest petrochemical complex in Latin America. Industries in Paulínia are concentrated in two distinct points: the REPLAN region and the district of Betel, which are consequently the richest and most polluted areas in Paulínia.

In 2005, Braskem and Petrobras Química S.A. - Petroquisa - set up Petroquímica Paulínia S.A., a joint venture responsible for operating a polypropylene industrial unit in the Replan region. It started operating in 2008, with initial capacity to produce 300 thousand tons per year of polypropylene, and potential to reach 350 thousand tons per year.

In late 2010, LG announced that it would build an industrial plant in the city of Paulínia, on land donated by the city government, which would produce white goods such as refrigerators, stoves, microwave ovens, among others. Construction was scheduled to begin in March 2011, with completion in October of the same year. The factory would employ 4.000 employees, surpassing Petrobras and becoming Paulínia&#x27;s largest employer. However, by October, the construction work had not begun, causing the councilors to question the city hall. The initial project foresaw a three-story building, more suitable to the irregularity of the terrain. However, LG&#x27;s headquarters requested a change to a single floor, which would have required the company to spend R$30 million on earthmoving. LG then asked the city to exchange the donated land, which was refused because there was no other land with the same measurements. After this refusal, the company asked the city to pay for the earthmoving, which was also rejected, because Mayor José Pavan Júnior considered that the administration had already spent too much on the project (the donated land was valued at at least R$100 million). Since then the contacts between the company and the city hall have decreased. The donated area will return to the city hall if construction does not begin by the end of 2015.

=== Recent History ===

Paulínia&#x27;s recent history is marked by great economic development, urban and population growth. Since the 1980s, when the municipal hospital was inaugurated, many works have been carried out to increase the capacity of some services. In 1981, the mayor of Paulínia at the time, Geraldo José Ballone, sent a law bill to the city council that created the municipal hospital. At the time the city had about 20,753 inhabitants, but the population did not have a public health facility in town that could provide examinations and consultations.

In the 1990s, great works were carried out in Paulínia, among them the construction of a virtual library, where citizens have free access to the internet, Paulínia&#x27;s sambodrome, which is the largest indoor sambodrome in the country, and the improvement of the city&#x27;s road systems.

The intense urban growth of Paulínia and neighboring cities provoked the conurbation effect. This phenomenon is stronger on the border of Paulínia with Sumaré, between the districts of Bom Retiro (Paulínia) and Maria Antônia (Sumaré), and on the border with Campinas, between the districts of Betel and Barão Geraldo. Paulínia has relevant territorial growth. In 1993 it annexed the Betel district, in Campinas, through a plebiscite. Neighborhoods and regions such as Granja Coavi, Parque dos Jequitibás and parts of the neighborhoods São José, João Aranha and Marieta Dian, which are in Cosmópolis and Americana also tend to be annexed by Paulínia.

== Geography ==

Paulínia&#x27;s geography is homogeneous. The municipality has a flat relief and Atlantic vegetation. The area of the municipality is 141.72 km2, representing 0.0509% of the São Paulo territory, 0.0353% of the area of the Southeast region of Brazil, and 0.0017% of the whole Brazilian territory. It is located in the central-eastern region of the state of São Paulo, between the Atibaia and Jaguari rivers and the Quilombo and Anhumas creeks, 118 kilometers from São Paulo by asphalt road, and 98 kilometers as the crow flies. Located in the Peripheral Paulista Depression, in São Paulo, the city borders Cosmópolis (to the north), Campinas (to the southeast), Sumaré (to the south), Nova Odessa (to the southwest), Jaguariúna (to the east), Holambra (to the northeast) and Americana (to the west). The urban perimeter of Paulínia is 137.61 km2, which is equivalent to 99% of the total area.

Paulínia is located in the central area of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, not bordering municipalities outside the region. Paulínia is geographically divided into two main regions, the north, where REPLAN and the district of São José are located, and the south, where Paulínia Shopping and the Paulínia Municipal Theater are, where the I Paulínia Film Festival was held; these two regions are divided by the Atibaia river. Paulínia&#x27;s position was a problem for the old farms located in this area, which saw the rivers as &quot;natural barriers to development&quot; in the region.

=== Relief and geology ===

Paulínia is located in the so-called Peripheral Paulista Depression, a formation between the western and Atlantic plateaus (&quot;Serra do Mar&quot; and &quot;Serra da Mantiqueira&quot;). The territory is homogeneous, with great relief variations only in the neighborhoods of Alto de Pinheiros, Vila Nunes, Marieta Dian, Santa Cecília and Tereza Zorzetto Vedovello. The highest neighborhoods in Paulínia are located in the northern and eastern regions of the city, such as Marieta Dian, São José and Parque das Indústrias.

Paulínia&#x27;s soil is also homogeneous, being of good quality in most of the city. It is characteristic for having a lot of humus, which facilitates the development of crops.

The lowest altitudes of the Paulista Peripheral Depression are located in the region of the Atibaia and Jaguari rivers, between 560 and 600 meters above sea level. In this region the morphology is characterized by broad hills with flattened tops. This zone also has its greatest thicknesses, with the presence of fluvial facies typical of floodplains. Near Paulínia, they reach a thickness of about 10 meters. The diabase rocks are abundant between Paulínia and Campinas, and are fine to medium grained.

=== Hydrography ===

Two rivers pass through the city of Paulínia: the Jaguari river, which is located on the border of Paulínia and Cosmópolis, and the Atibaia river, which divides the city into two parts and passes near the center. Its origin is in Bom Jesus dos Perdões, the result of the junction of the Atibainha and Cachoeira rivers. In the municipality of Americana the river is dammed and the Salto Grande reservoir, as it is known, extends to the São Paulo neighborhoods of Parque da Represa and Balneário Tropical. The Jaguari river originates in Minas Gerais and receives important tributaries, such as the Camanducaia River. In the São Paulo territory the river is dammed as part of the cantareira system and in Americana it joins with the Atibaia river and forms the Piracicaba river.

Besides these rivers, several streams and creeks are present in Paulínia, especially the Quilombo creek, on the border with Sumaré, and the Anhumas creek, on the border with Campinas and Jaguariúna. Among the streams are Jacaré and Jacarezinho, which are tributaries of Jaguari, Areião, Veadinho, and São Bento, tributaries of the Atibaia River, and the streams Betel, Fazenda do Deserto and Velosa (the latter on the border with Sumaré), tributaries of Quilombo Creek. The municipality also has several lakes and lagoons, the main ones being Santa Terezinha, Armando Ferreira, Jardim Botânico, José Maria Malavazzi and César Bierrembach.

=== Climate ===
The city of Paulínia belongs to the climate zone designated by the letter C, with climate type Cwa, according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, and the climate is considered subhumid temperate, with rains concentrated in the summer months, with a decrease in its frequency in the winter, when the relative humidity of the air drops, especially during the afternoon, with rates below 30% or even close to 20%. Due to the low concentration of buildings, heat islands rarely occur, so the thermometers remain below the 40 °C mark in most of the city, even in the hottest months of the year.

According to data from the Integrated Center for Agrometeorological Information (CIIAGRO/SP), referring to the period from December 1993 to January 2011 and from February 2016, the absolute minimum temperature recorded in Paulinia was 0 °C in June 1994, on 26 and 27 June, and the highest reached 40.6 °C on 8 October 2020. The highest rainfall accumulations recorded in 24 hours, equal to or greater than 100 mm, were 119.4 mm on 1 December 2003, 118.6 mm on 17 November 2003, and 103.4 mm on 22 December 2020.
=== Biodiversity and green areas ===

Paulínia&#x27;s fauna presents species typical of the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, but in some places species from other domains can be found. In the minipantanal, which is an area of transition between biomes, species such as the spot-flanked gallinule, black skimmer, herons, and nutrias can be found. Capybaras are found almost everywhere along the Atibaia River, and are common in the Campinas region.

Paulínia is a municipality where a large part of the original landscape, originally covered by the Atlantic Forest, has been modified due to human action. Currently the few original green areas are protected so that they do not disappear. In order to do this, the city government has created the areas of environmental preservation under reclamation, to recover degraded areas. The main areas where the vegetation is intact or little altered are located in the neighborhoods of Cascata, Recanto dos Pássaros, Parque Brasil 500, Betel, Planalto and Monte Alegre. Other preserved areas are in rural or uninhabited areas, such as Jardim Harmonia, isolated regions of Betel, bordering areas and areas in the north of Paulínia.

Several environmental areas in Paulínia are important tourist attractions, such as the minipantanal and the botanical garden, which is one of the most respected in the state and in the country.

=== Environmental Problems ===

Paulínia is environmentally stressed, which means that it has a vegetation cover of less than 5% of the municipal area, consequently presenting higher risks of flooding,aggradation of water courses, erosion, and disappearance of fauna and flora. In heavy rainfall events, several streets and avenues in Paulínia suffer from flooding. Among the regions where this problem is constant, the low-lying areas near the César Bierrembach lagoon in the neighborhoods São José and João Aranha, on José Paulino Avenue, in the Recanto dos Pássaros and Jardim Europa neighborhoods stand out. The problems occur mainly due to the lack of culverts and galleries for draining excess water, except in the case of Recanto dos Pássaros, which is affected by the flooding of the Atibaia river.

The city&#x27;s air pollution by ozone is intense, mainly due to the large amount of polluting industries, such as REPLAN, but contrary to what is commonly said, the city has normal levels of other pollutants, such as the hourly average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which was 87.8 ppb (particles per billion) in 2002, while the acceptable level is 170 ppb.

The city also suffers from water pollution that affects some of the city&#x27;s streams. The city&#x27;s rivers, mainly the Atibaia river, are also affected by contamination with chemicals highly harmful to health, as in 1995, when it became public the contamination of the Atibaia river and the water table near the area by Shell, which due to flooding and the fact that many residents use wells, contaminated the population of the Recanto dos Pássaros neighborhood, who were forced to leave the place. Currently there is still a problem with the contamination caused by Shell, and efforts are being made to prevent a bigger problem from occurring.

Some streams in Paulínia, such as the Jacaré stream, are at risk of disappearing due to environmental damage in their sources. The Jacaré stream has its spring at the central border of José Bordignon Avenue, near a scrap metal warehouse, and its first stretches are full of garbage, which can gradually compromise the César Bierrembach lagoon, which depends largely on this stream. The Morro Alto stream, located in the neighborhood of the same name and a tributary of the Atibaia river, disappeared due to the subdivision of its source area, where the Parque das Árvores neighborhood was created.

== Demography ==

According to the IBGE, the municipality&#x27;s population in 2010 was counted at 82,150 inhabitants, being the 87th most populous municipality in the state, with a population density of 368.46 inhabitants per km2. According to the 2010 census, 49.51% of the population is male and 50.49% is female, and 99.91% of the population lives in the urban area and 0.09% lives in the rural area. According to the Atlas of Human Development in Brazil, the population of Paulínia is equivalent to 0.06% of the national population, and according to the IBGE, Paulínia had 50,566 voters in 2006. In the last few years, Paulínia has had a relevant population growth.

The Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M) of Paulínia is considered high by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with a value of 0.847. Considering only education, the index value is 0.924, while Brazil&#x27;s is 0.849, the longevity index is 0.805 (Brazil&#x27;s is 0.638), and the income index is 0.811 (Brazil&#x27;s is 0.723). Paulínia has most of the high indicators according to the UNDP. The per capita income is 106,082.00 &quot;reais&quot;, the literacy rate is 93.93% and the life expectancy is 73.30 years. The Gini coefficient, which measures social inequality, is 0.39, where 1.00 is the worst number and 0.00 is the best. The incidence of poverty, measured by IBGE, is 14.76% and the incidence of subjective poverty is 10.93%. Paulínia has improved all its indicators in the last years, showing that the improvement in the quality of life has been increasing. The population of Paulinia is composed of 71% white, 22% brown, 5% black and 2% people of other ethnicities.

Two problems of the city are the housing deficit and the deficit of places in day care centers. The housing deficit in Paulínia is approximately ten thousand dwellings. The city administration is studying several projects to enable the construction of affordable housing and reduce this number, among them the construction of two subdivisions in the João Aranha and São Bento neighborhoods. Paulínia has no slums or illegal allotments, but has a large number of tenements and some invasions, the largest of which is located near the allotment Jardim Amélia Duarte Quintal, in the Saltinho neighborhood, whose families come from another invasion, called Granja Coavi, located in Cosmópolis. The growth of this invasion is already causing many people to consider it a slum beginning. There is also another invasion in the southern region of the city, in the Paraíso farm, which was occupied after the expropriation of the land by the city government, which to this day has not carried out works in the area. However, this invasion may disappear with the arrival of LG, which will install an industrial unit in part of the farm. The problem of lack of vacancies in day care centers is also serious, because despite having 27 units, there is still a deficit of 900 vacancies. Two day care centers were to be inaugurated in 2009, however, the construction of a unit in the Bom Retiro neighborhood was paralyzed and deprived the municipality of about 300 vacancies.

=== Religion ===

Regarding the administration of the Catholic Church, the municipality is covered by the Archdiocese of Campinas. Since its origins, Paulínia has had a strong connection with Saint Benedict, a saint who is credited with ridding people of snake bites. There have always been many snakes in the region of Paulínia, and the saint was the way people found to prevent bites by saying a simple prayer: &quot;Saint Benedict, rid me of this poisonous creature&quot;. The Saint was the patron saint of the locality until 1922, when Dom Paulo de Tarso Campos determined the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus as the patron saint of the parish, after Canon Samuel Fragoso organized a prayer group to that saint, on the occasion of the arrival of Father Pedro Tomazini, the first parish priest of Paulínia. The city has two parishes, Sacred Heart of Jesus and Our Lady of the Beautiful Branch, and several communities, such as St. Jude Thaddeus and St. Lucy, among others.

The city has the most diverse Protestant or reformed creeds, such as the Lutheran Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Baptist Church, the &quot;Assembleias de Deus&quot;, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, among others. Currently, the number of Protestants in Paulínia is growing.

Among other religions, Buddhism, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Church of World Messianity stand out in Paulínia in number of adherents, religions that have shown a small growth in recent years. Currently the municipality has 36,807 Catholics, 9,014 Protestants, 184 Messianics, 97 Buddhists, 388 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, 2,913 people with no religion and 1,923 people of other religions.

== Politics ==

The executive power is represented by the mayor, assisted by his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The first representative of the executive power and mayor of the municipality was José Lozano Araújo, elected soon after the emancipation of the town. In thirteen mandates, eleven mayors have passed through the City Hall of Paulínia. In the last few years, the position was held by Edson Moura, elected in 2000 and reelected in 2004. In 2009, José Pavan Júnior (PSB) took over the mayor&#x27;s office, who was removed from office on 20 July of the same year. The interim mayor, Marcos Roberto Bolonhezi, took over until the 22nd, when Pavan returned to the mayor&#x27;s office due to the suspension of the cassation.

The City Council represents the legislative power. It has ten councilmen, and is composed as follows: two seats from the PTdoB; two seats from the PSB; two seats from the Progressive Party (PP); one seat from the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB); one seat from the Christian Social Democratic Party (PSDC); one seat from the PCdoB, and one seat from the Workers&#x27; Party (PT).

The judicial power is represented by the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Paulínia and by the courts; the Desembargador Plínio Coelho Brandão Labor Court, belonging to the 15th Region, underwent a remodeling in 2008 with the expansion of the total built area and of the areas of the secretariats of two labor courts. Paulínia also receives labor cases from Cosmópolis, and in 2007 the courts received 2,573 new lawsuits, settling 2,402. The Public Ministry has participated in several lawsuits against the city hall and companies, in cases such as Shell&#x27;s contamination of the Recanto dos Pássaros neighborhood and the construction of a toll road on Professor Zeferino Vaz Highway. Paulínia is part of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Campinas.

== Subdivisions ==

Paulínia&#x27;s first division of neighborhoods was established on 30 October 1979, by Decree No. 1248/1979. That division established 21 neighborhoods and lasted until 1999. Paulínia&#x27;s current neighborhood division was established by Municipal Law 2 229 of 21 January 1999, with changes made by Law 2 372 of 3 April 2000 and Law 3 008 of 31 August 2009. These Laws established 38 neighborhoods in Paulínia, but they did not delimit important subdivisions, such as São José (which is in the João Aranha area) and Ouro Negro (located in the Jardim Planalto area), despite the administration itself treating them as neighborhoods.

The oldest neighborhoods in Paulínia are João Aranha, Monte Alegre and the central neighborhoods. Currently Paulínia consists of 38 neighborhoods, as well as numerous subdivisions and the district of Betel. The municipality is divided into 5 main regions which are divided into 11 smaller sub-regions polarized by 17 main neighborhoods and encompassing several smaller neighborhoods. The municipality has few neighborhoods in the rural area, the largest being Recanto das Águas, Bela Vista II, Saltinho and São Bento. Most of the neighborhoods are in the city, due to the urbanization that the municipality has been undergoing.

== Economy ==

Paulínia is the biggest petrochemical power in Latin America, being home to REPLAN, the biggest Petrobras and Brazilian refinery, besides having countless other establishments and industries in the sector, representing companies such as Transo, Shell, Exxon, Fic, Rhodia, among others, which, attracted by the good infrastructure and by advantages offered by the city hall, such as exemption or reduction in municipal taxes, have settled in the city. GDP per capita is quite high, as is its Gross Domestic Product, which is R$6,734,450, representing the 63rd city with the highest per capita income in Brazil. In addition to oil, Paulínia has food and mechanical industries. With the &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot; project, an increase in companies linked to tourism and cinema is predicted. There are 346 industrial, 1679 commercial and 1305 service establishments in the municipality. The services sector employed the most in 2009, with 15,454 workers, followed by industry, which employed 9,020 people. The formal labor force in Paulínia was 43,304 people in 2001, the working age population was 26,281, and the consumption potential index was US$2,775. The municipality has 3,011 local units, according to IBGE data from 2005. The estimated budget for 2011 is R$892.1 million. In recent years, Paulínia&#x27;s foreign trade has been growing, as shown in the table above.

=== Primary Sector ===

Agriculture is of little importance in Paulínia. The main crops are sugar cane, corn and orange. The north-northwest regions used to stand out for the large orange production, but this culture has been losing space to the subdivision of land in the region, with the creation of neighborhoods such as São José and Marieta Dian. Sugar cane is still a highlight in the southern region, with large producing areas. In total, Paulínia has 380 farms, but most of them are small-sized.

According to the IBGE in 2006 Paulínia had a herd of 246 cattle, 334 pigs, 95 horses, 91 sheep, and 292,490 poultry, among these 182,490 chickens and 110,000 roosters, chickens and chicks. In 2006 the city produced 150,000 liters of milk from 97 cows. 3.285 million dozen hen eggs were produced.

Paulínia&#x27;s permanent plantation produces mainly oranges (9,513 tons) and avocados (3,619 tons). Considering the relation between planted area and total harvested, the guava stands out, producing 45,000 kilos per hectare, and the tangerine, whose yield is 46,500 kilos per hectare. Coffee, which was very important in the past, has lost importance, and currently only 32 tons are produced.

=== Secondary Sector ===

The secondary sector is currently the main source generating Paulínia&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product. Represented mainly by the chemical and petrochemical industries, Paulínia&#x27;s secondary sector is known for the large number of industries, especially multinationals, such as the American ExxonMobil and the New Zealand-British Shell. Paulínia&#x27;s industrial development began with the installation of Rhodia on São Francisco farm, in 1942, when Paulínia still belonged to Campinas, but the main event occurred after emancipation, with the inauguration of REPLAN in 1972, which transformed the town into a large producer of refined petroleum. The industrial pole in Paulínia, formed by companies such as Petrobras, owner of Replan, Fic, Ipiranga, Eucatex and Rhodia makes the city the largest petrochemical pole in Latin America. Other companies stand out, such as Nutriara, from the food industry, Cargill and Purina, from the animal feed industry, AsGa, from the telecommunications industry, among others.

Replan is Petrobras&#x27; biggest refinery in terms of production. It produces several products, such as asphalt, kerosene, and gasoline, and its production is mainly sold to the state of São Paulo. It is responsible for about twelve billion &quot;reais&quot; per year in taxes paid to the government and for Paulínia&#x27;s high per capita income.

Paulínia&#x27;s industry is the third largest GDP generator in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, smaller only than the neighboring metropolis, Campinas, and the city of Sumaré. The industrial sector accounts for almost 50% of Paulínia&#x27;s GDP. Oil derivatives represent the most produced products in Paulínia, followed by other chemical products and food.

==== Petrochemical Pole ====
The largest chemical and petrochemical industrial complex in Brazil is located in the northern region of the municipality. Centered in the Planalto Paulista Refinery, there are also companies such as Rhodia, the first in the city, Shell, Ipiranga, ExxonMobil and Braskem. The center is responsible for a good part of the jobs and of the Gross Domestic Product of Paulínia, being one of the main reasons for attracting immigrants to the city.

=== Tertiary sector ===

Nationally, Paulínia&#x27;s commerce is not outstanding. In the tertiary sector, the town is known for having a large cinema pole, built through the &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot; project, and which has been the location for several films, such as &quot;O Menino da Porteira&quot;. Tourism is also important in the town.

José Paulino Avenue, in the center of Paulínia, has important commercial establishments, most of them being branches of large national chains. Other important commercial centers in Paulínia are the districts of Santa Cecília and Nova Paulínia, where Santa Cruz Street is located, headquarters of numerous medical clinics and other stores. The sector that most employs in Paulínia is the tertiary one, which at the beginning of 2001 employed 978 people.

In 2006 the city administration created the project &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot;, with the goals of increasing tourism and boosting the economy. Through this project, the Paulínia Film Festival, Paulínia Cinematographic Pole, &quot;Magia do Cinema&quot; School and the Paulínia Film Commission were idealized. Several films have already been shot at the pole, such as &quot;O Menino da Porteira&quot; and &quot;Topografia de um Desnudo&quot;. The cinema pole is the result of one of the largest investments in audiovisual production in Brazil. Around 550 million &quot;reais&quot; from the administration and companies have already been spent on the project. &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot; project has been highlighted in the national press due to the size of the investments.

==== Tourism ====

Paulínia has many tourist attractions. Among the most visited natural tourist spots are the minipantanal, the ecological park, and the Adelelmo Piva Júnior Botanical Garden, which still keeps animal and vegetal species preserved in their natural habitat. The virtual library, where the population has free access to the internet, and the Municipal Theater, part of Paulínia&#x27;s cinematographic pole, are other important tourist attractions.

The portals located at the entrances to the city are symbols of Paulínia. With different styles, they are tourist attractions and have municipal guard posts. The main ones are the Medieval Portal, the Colonial, the Futuristic and the Parque Brasil 500. Paulínia&#x27;s squares and traffic circles are also visited a lot thanks to the decoration made with several colorful plants, which form drawings of several shapes. The Paul Percy Harris square is known for having the largest Rotarian symbol in the world.

Other tourist attractions in Paulínia are the Cidade Feliz fountain, which supplies mineral water to the population, the bicycle cross track, where several competitions are held, such as Bicicross Américas, Zeca Malavazzi park, Brasil 500 park, the historical museum, Saint Benedict church, and the Sagrado Coração de Jesus square.

Paulínia&#x27;s carnival is considered the largest in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas and is much appreciated by tourists, especially from towns in the area. The main schools are Hawaí 71, Ktoto, Unidos do João Aranha, among others. The samba school parades are held in the largest indoor sambodrome in Brazil.

Paulínia&#x27;s events and tourist sites attract many tourists every year. Events such as &quot;Folia de Reis&quot;, &quot;Paulitália&quot;, which is a party in honor of the Italian immigrants in Paulínia, and the Christmas of Lights stand out.

== Urban Structure ==

Paulínia has a great urban infrastructure. The city&#x27;s water and sewage service is provided by Sabesp. The water consumed by the inhabitants of Paulínia comes from the Jaguari river, on the border with Cosmópolis, which undergoes treatment in the city&#x27;s water treatment station. The city also has two important mineral water springs, one in the Cascata neighborhood and the other on the access to downtown.

The electric power is supplied by the company CPFL, which has several distribution centers in neighborhoods such as Cascata, Bela Vista and Santa Terezinha, as well as a substation near the São Francisco farm. In addition, there are several transmission towers, installed on the central beds and sidewalks of some avenues, such as Avenida José Padovani and Nelson Prosdócimo.

In the municipality there are two cemeteries, which are the Municipal Cemetery, in the center, and the Palm Tree Cemetery, in the Santa Terezinha neighborhood, as well as two post office distribution centers.

=== Security ===
As in most Brazilian medium and large cities, criminality is a serious problem in Paulínia. In 2006 the homicide rate in the municipality was 8.6, a fall of 39% compared to the 2002 rate, which was 22.1. In absolute numbers, the average of homicides in the decade of 2000 was 10.33 homicides per year. The rate of firearm-related deaths, after increasing between 2002 and 2004, started to decrease in 2005, and was 7.2 in 2006. The number of murders and robberies increased 2.8% from 1999 to 2004, and the number of deaths by assault rose 105.7% in the same period.

Drug trafficking is also present, and a recent concern is crack. With the pulverization of cracolândia, in São Paulo, many users went to cities in the interior, such as Paulínia. Currently places like Morro Alto and Marieta Dian neighborhoods, as well as São Bento Street, have points of sale and consumption of the drug. Another very common crime is theft (robbery without violence). In the first half of 2012, Paulínia was the municipality in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas with the most cases, in relation to the population. There were 90 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.

Paulínia has a police station located in the Santa Cecília neighborhood, which currently has Sandro Montanari as its delegate. There are also two community police stations in the city, one in João Aranha and the other in Betel. The city&#x27;s portals have one guard post each, in order to patrol the entrances and exits of the city, but have been criticized for not having municipal guards on many occasions.

=== Education ===
Paulínia has schools in all regions of the municipality. Due to intense urbanization, rural residents have easy access to schools in nearby urban districts. Education in municipal schools has a higher level than in state schools, but the city government is creating studies to make state public education better, in order to achieve better results in IDEB.

Paulínia has 25 elementary, middle and high schools, besides 12 pre-schools. The technical schools ETEP and CEMEP stand out in Paulínia. The latter is considered the best school in Paulínia and offers computer, hardware, programming and high school courses.

In 2007 there were 12,037 elementary school enrollments, 3188 secondary school enrollments, 1380 higher education enrollments, and 3292 pre-school enrollments. There were 29 teachers in higher education in 2007.

Paulínia has a higher education institution, the Paulínia College, which is private. The city also has a Unicamp research center, the Pluridisciplinary Center for Chemical, Biological and Agricultural Research (CPQBA), located in the district of Betel.
=== Health ===

Paulínia has 20 health establishments, 14 of which are public, including hospitals, emergency rooms, health posts, and dental services. The city has 106 beds for hospitalization in healthcare facilities, of which 83 are public and 23 private. There is also the CETREIM (Municipal Integrated Therapy and Rehabilitation Center) and the Preventive Health Center, being classified by SEADE as the 6th best in the Government region.

Until the beginning of the year 2000 Paulínia had few public health units, the only ones existing being the municipal hospital, a small health center in the João Aranha district and another in Nova Paulínia. From that year on new units started to be built due to the city&#x27;s growth, since the original ones were not supporting the amount of services.

Paulínia&#x27;s municipal hospital was built in the early 1980s and underwent its first major structural renovation in 2008, when the hospital&#x27;s area was expanded, which made it possible to increase capacity and, consequently, services. Soon afterwards, other stages of the renovation began, consisting of the construction of a helipad to facilitate the transport of patients in serious condition to larger hospitals, such as the Clinics Hospital of the University of Campinas.

=== Communications ===
Paulínia has many means of communication, especially newspapers. The most traditional are &quot;Jornal de Paulínia&quot;, created in the 1960s by journalist Carlos Tontoli; &quot;Correio Paulinense&quot;, created by Mizael Marcelly; &quot;O Cromo&quot;; &quot;Agora Paulínia&quot; by Alexandre Mane; and &quot;Tribuna de Paulínia&quot;. Many newspapers from Paulínia also circulate in Cosmópolis and Artur Nogueira. The newspapers &quot;Notícia Já&quot;, &quot;Correio Popular&quot;, &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot;, &quot;O Estado de S. Paulo&quot;, &quot;Agora&quot;, &quot;Todo Dia&quot;, among others, also circulate in the city. There are four radio stations in the city: &quot;Paulínia FM, Matriz FM, A Mais FM,&quot; and &quot;Rádio Canção Nova AM&quot;.

In Paulínia there are dial-up and broadband (ADSL and radio) internet services being offered by several providers. In fixed-line telephony the city was initially served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira (CTB) until 1973, when it started to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo (TELESP), which built the telephone exchanges used until today. In 1998 this company was privatized and sold to Telefónica, and in 2012 the company adopted the Vivo brand for its operations. The operators Vivo, TIM and Claro offer mobile phone service. Paulínia&#x27;s area code is 19 and since the beginning of 2009, Paulínia is served by portability, as well as other 72 cities with an area code of 19 and a ZIP code that goes from 13140–001 to 13149–999. Portability is a service that makes it possible to change the operator without the need to change the phone number.

=== Transportation ===
Paulínia has a good highway-railroad network that connects it to several cities in the interior of the state and even to the capital. Paulínia is close to the Viracopos International Airport (IATA: VCP - ICAO: SBKP), one of the largest in the country, and has access to highways of state and even national importance through paved side roads with double lane, such as the Prefeito José Lozano Araújo road. Currently, the vehicle fleet in Paulínia is 24,448 cars, 1468 trucks, 1065 tractor trucks, 1970 pickup trucks, 5710 motorcycles, 227 buses and only 9 agricultural tractors. The Anhanguera, Bandeirantes and Dom Pedro I highways do not pass through the area of the municipality of Paulínia, but are easily accessible through side roads, besides SP-332 which is state highway.

The duplicated and paved avenues improve traffic in the city and some avenues on the outskirts relieve traffic in the city center. Traffic on the city&#x27;s main avenue was being hampered by the growth in the number of vehicles in Paulínia, which forced the administration to improve the public road system to avoid overloading the city center. However, the fact that the northern region, separated from the other regions by the Atibaia river, is connected to these regions only by a bridge, between José Paulino Avenue and PLN 339, is already causing congestion in the latter and other tributary roads, such as São Bento and João Franco Cunha Streets. That is why projects to build another connection between the north and the other regions are already being analyzed.

==== Air Transportation ====
Paulínia doesn&#x27;t have commercial airports in its territory. However, Viracopos Airport is located in the city of Campinas, 31 km from Paulínia&#x27;s downtown, in the same Metropolitan Region of Campinas, serving the whole region with daily flights to São Paulo and other destinations. Besides Viracopos, the Campo dos Amarais Airport is located about 9 km from the city, also in Campinas.

==== Public roads ====
In Paulínia there is a system of public roads which allows access to other cities and highways without having to go through the city center. Due to the problems that José Paulino Avenue, in the city center, was facing with the excess of vehicles, avenues were built in the periphery that connect the neighborhoods to other neighborhoods and highways, such as the avenues Oswaldo Piva, Roma, and Expedicionários. With the concession of the SP-332 highway and the possible installation of a toll booth on it, there is the possibility of the center being used as an escape route, which would make the traffic problems return.

Paulínia&#x27;s avenues are characterized by their large amount of trees, especially José Paulino and João Aranha avenues. With the afforestation of these avenues the administration aimed to improve the air quality of the main regions of the city and increase ecological tourism in the city.

==== Highways ====

The main access to other cities in Paulínia is SP-332, or Professor Zeferino Vaz highway, which connects it to Campinas and Cosmópolis, and also to Dom Pedro I highway. Another external access to Paulínia is through the Doutor Roberto Moreira highway, which connects the city to Barão Geraldo. Prefeito José Lozano Araújo highway connects Paulínia to the cities of Sumaré and Hortolândia, and to Anhanguera and Bandeirantes highways. Other exits from Paulínia are PLN 311, located in the São José district and which connects to Cosmópolis and Americana, and PLN 313, which crosses the João Aranha, Viacava, Marieta Dian and Recanto das Águas districts, and also gives access to Americana and Cosmópolis, etc. Most of Paulínia&#x27;s avenues are duplicated and most neighborhoods have paved streets, including some rural roads. Paulínia has the PLN 110 Road Complex, which provides access to various highways and avenues in the city.

==== Collective Transportation ====
Paulínia has about 15 circular bus lines that lead to all neighborhoods in the city. The city government subsidizes 56% of the value of the circular bus fare, which is equivalent to R$1.00. The main problems in Paulínia&#x27;s public transportation are bus delays and crowding, results of a large number of users and the small number of vehicles circulating in the city.

==== Railroad Transportation ====

Paulínia is currently crossed by a railroad which connects Replan to other important regions. This railroad is part of the FEPASA railroad system, and near the Doutor Roberto Moreira Highway it splits, with one part going to Jaguariúna and the other to REPLAN and Cosmópolis. A partnership between the companies ALL and Katoen Natie has built a railroad linking Paulínia to the Port of Santos that facilitates the transport of containers from Paulínia.

==== Bike paths ====
Until the mid-1990s Paulínia had no bike path. In this period it was built a bike path on the central ridges of João Aranha, Fausto Pietrobom and Paulista Avenues, about 4.5 km long. Subsequently, a bike path was built on the central median of Antônio Batista Piva Avenue, measuring just over 1 km in length. There are also lanes for pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalk of Duque de Caxias, José Paulino and José Lozano Araújo Avenues.

== Culture and leisure ==

Among Paulínia&#x27;s main leisure spots are São Bento Square, José Paulino Avenue, and Sagrado Coração de Jesus Square, where several events take place during the year.

Paulínia&#x27;s municipal ecological park Armando Müller, located in the central region of the city, is used by the population for leisure and recreation. People use it to picnic and enjoy nature, since the park contains several animal and plant species. The large number of plants and trees at the site earns it the nickname &quot;bosquinho&quot; (English: little forest). Occupying an area of 65,000 m2 and divided into various ecosystems, the park has a total of 398 species, 240 wild, 41 exotic, and 117 domestic.

Another choice for leisure and culture is represented by the Municipal Theater of Paulínia, opened on 4 July 2008, built to receive, besides plays, events related to cinema, presentation of dances, besides other shows. The theater is also the stage for &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot;, one of the main events in the city.

=== Cuisine ===
In Paulínia&#x27;s menu, as well as in a large part of the state, it is common to find rice and beans, the basis of the meals, and steak, chicken, sausage, ground meat, and lettuce and tomato salad as side dishes. Due to its historical past, Paulínia is influenced by Italian cuisine, with the presence of pizza, pasta, sauces, etc. Besides these dishes, the so-called &quot;caipira&quot; food, a set of typical dishes from the countryside of São Paulo, is very popular in the city. Among this type of food, several types of &quot;farofas&quot;, &quot;caipira&quot; chicken, and &quot;pamonha&quot; stand out. The sugarcanejuice, &quot;paçoca&quot;, and, more recently, the so-called fast dishes, which have been conquering more and more space in the country, are also popular. In Campinas there is the Campinas Gastronomic Festival, which brings together restaurants from the city and the region, preparing countless typical local dishes.

=== Arts ===
The fact that the city is home to Agostinho Batista de Freitas, a &quot;naïve&quot; painter who characterized himself as a painter of urban landscapes, and who was presented at the Venice Biennale in 1961, stands out in the art of São Paulo. Furthermore, the city does not have an art scene of national importance, except for the performing arts. The main artistic event in the city is Expo Art, an event held annually since 2008, which aims to promote artists from São Paulo.

In the city there is a program aimed at fostering art in the municipality called &quot;Espaço Ação &amp; Arte&quot; (English: Action &amp; Art Space). The program, coordinated by Paulínia&#x27;s Community Action Center (CACO), aims to qualify people, generating work and income through the appreciation of artistic activities. The program&#x27;s main action is the handicraft workshops, which promote the learning of craft techniques, such as fabric painting, embroidery, and knitting.

=== Literature and performing arts ===
Paulínia has little tradition in literature and performing arts, but in spite of this, with the advent of the project &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot;, these artistic manifestations have been more encouraged by the administration. In 2009, there was the Analysis and Merit Process for Obtaining the Professional Qualification Certificate from SATED/SP, which qualified 27 performing arts professionals, the largest recorded in the interior of São Paulo up to that date. In the same year the &quot;Virada Cultural Paulista&quot; took place in the city, and the highlight in the scenic arts was a children&#x27;s musical from the city itself.

Some artistic institutions that stand out in the city are Ceart-Center for the Arts in Paulínia and the Culture Space (&quot;Magia do Cinema&quot; School). The first is a theater group that performs musicals such as &quot;Os Saltimbancos&quot;, &quot;Para Viver um Grande Amor&quot; (with poems from the book of the same name by Vinicius de Moraes) and &quot;Roda Viva&quot;. The group is formed by actors from Paulínia and its cast interprets and sings live on stage. The &quot;Magia do Cinema&quot; School, on the other hand, is an initiative of the city hall through the project &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot;. It offers courses in the areas of cinema, theater, dance, and music, such as stage characterization, dramatic literature, history of art and theater, among others. This school, in partnership with Getulio Vargas Foundation and Senac, aims to train qualified professionals in the area of cinema and theater to enter the job market created with the project &quot;Paulínia Magia do Cinema&quot;. In Paulínia&#x27;s literature, the highlight is Raimundo Lonato, who has written several books for children and teenagers, literature-reportage and poems. The writer has already been present in events such as the Porto Alegre Book Fair and the 20th São Paulo Biennial Book Fair.

=== Sports ===

Soccer has always been one of the most popular sports in Paulínia. Before emancipation, bocce shared with soccer the title of most popular sport in the locality. After emancipation, the first municipal incentive for sports was the creation of the Municipal Sports Commission by Mayor Vicente Amatte, in 1973. After some time, the agency became subordinated to the Sports and Tourism Sector (Setur). In 1976, Setur&#x27;s supervisor, Ary Rodriguez, created the Workers&#x27; Sports Games, which are still a success in the city today.

In 1993, the then mayor Edson Moura created the Secretariat of Sports and Recreation. From then on, several projects to encourage the practice of sports were developed, such as the participation in Regional Games and in the Countryside Open Games. In 2005 the city had the best passage through the Open Games to that date: 3rd place, behind Campinas and Araras. Other events organized by Secretariat are the vacation gymkhana, which is in its 20th edition; the Municipal Futsal Championship, which went to its 25th edition in 2010.

Recently, soccer has been highlighted again with Paulínia Futebol Clube, the first professional club in the city that competes in the B series of the Campeonato Paulista. The city also has the Luís Perissinoto Municipal Stadium and several fields. Teams often train at Paulínia&#x27;s training centers or at the stadium, due to the good conditions of the grass. The Paulínia Amateur Soccer Championship also takes place in the municipality, which has been played since 1970. In 2010 the tournament was divided into two divisions, with 16 teams in the First Division and 41 teams in the Second, and in 2011 the Second Division had only 16 teams, and the Third Division was created. The games are held in several different locations, being the fields in the Morumbi, Santa Cecilia, São José, Serra Azul, the Etori di&#x27;Blásio Sports Center (Monte Alegre neighborhood), the Waldemar Perissinoto square sports center, and the Agostinho Fávaro Gymnasium field (João Aranha neighborhood).

Paulínia has a great tradition in motocross, with one of the best teams in Brazil. The Petrobrás/Paulínia team has several Brazilian, State and international titles. The team originated in the Paulínia Racing Bicicross project, created by the city hall to encourage the sport in the city. Currently, the team is seven-time Brazilian and São Paulo State champion. The city also hosted for several years the Bicicross Americas, one of the greatest competitions in Brazil and in the continent.

Other popular sports in Paulínia are basketball, handball and volleyball. Basketball is governed by the Friends of Basketball Association of Paulínia (AAB Paulínia), which coordinates the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and junior men&#x27;s basketball club teams in Paulínia. In handball, the SER/UH/Paulínia team stands out, maintained by the city hall. The team is associated with the Handball League of the State of São Paulo, alternative association of the sport in the state. In volleyball, the teams that participate in the Regional Games and in the Interior Open Games stand out. The teams in these three sports use the sports gyms Agostinho Fávaro, located in João Aranha, and Vicente Amatte, located in Santa Cecília.

Recently the sports modality of street running has been growing among the population, and there have been events organized with support from the City Hall. Noteworthy are the running and walking events promoted by the Paulinense Sports Association (AEP) and by local businesses, such as the 1st Calegaris Run in 2017, organized by the supermarket chain that gives its name to the event.

=== Holidays ===
In Paulínia there are five municipal holidays, eight national holidays and, in 2012, three optional workdays. The municipal holidays are the day of political-administrative emancipation of Paulínia, on 28 February; Good Friday, on 6 April; Corpus Christi, on 7 June; Sacred Heart of Jesus Day (patron saint of Paulínia), on the eighth day after &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; (15 June); and the civil holiday of the day of the Constitutionalist Soldier, on 9 July. Except for the 28 February and 9 July holidays, all have moving dates. In 2012, the optional workdays were: Carnival Monday, 20 February; Carnival Tuesday, 21 February; Ash Wednesday, 22 February. However, the optional workdays can be changed, deleted or even created during the year, by decree of the mayor. In the case of optional workdays, services considered essential to the population cannot be interrupted.

<text>Kgalagadi is a district in southwest Botswana, lying along the country&#x27;s border with Namibia and South Africa. The administrative center is Tsabong. The district of Kgalagadi covers a large part of the Kalahari Desert. It has a total area of 105,200 km2 and has a population of 42,000 (2001). More than one-third of the district is covered by the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, which extends into South Africa, and which is a major tourist attraction.

As of 2011, the total population of the district was 50,492 (compared to 42,049 in 2001). The growth rate of population during the decade was 1.85. Kgalagadi&#x27;s population represents 2.49 per cent of the total population of Botswana. The majority of employees (in 2011 there were 10,530 people in work) were working within the transport &amp; communication and public administration sectors. The district is administered by a district administration and district council.

==Geography==

Kgalagadi borders Omaheke Region, Namibia in the northwest, Hardap Region, Namibia in the southwest, Northern Cape Province, South Africa in the south, North West Province, South Africa in the southeast and domestically, Ghanzi District in the north, Kweneng District in the northeast, and Southern District in the east. Kgalagadi means &quot;land of the thirst&quot;. The largest settlement in the district is Tsabong, which had a population of 8939 in 2011 census while Hukuntsi and Kang had 4654 and 5985, respectively. Most part of Botswana has tableland slopes sliding from east to west. The region has an average elevation of around above the mean sea level. The vegetation type is Savannah, with tall grasses, bushes and trees. The annual precipitation is around , most of which is received during the summer season from November to May. Most of the rivers in the region are seasonal, with Limpopo River, which are prone to flash floods, being the most prominent. The tourist and game reserves in the region are Ghanzi, Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Deception Valley, Ghanzi Craft, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Khutse Game Reserve and Kuru Museum and Cultural Centre.

==Demographics==

As of 2011, the total population of the district was 50,492 compared to 42,049 in 2001. The growth rate of population during the decade was 1.85. The population in the district was 2.49 per cent of the total population in the country. The sex ratio stood at 101.78 for every 100 males, compared to 101.18 in 2001. The average house hold size was 3.12 in 2011 compared to 4.31 in 2001. There were 1,576 craft and related workers, 628 clerks, 4,039 people working in elementary occupation 256 legislators, administrators and managers 614 Plant &amp; machine operators and assemblers, 266 professionals, 1,278 service workers, shop and market sales workers, 1,309 skilled agricultural and related workers 771 technicians and associated professionals, making the total work force to 10,770.

==Economy and education==
As of 2011, there were a total of 41 schools in the district, with no private schools. The total number of students in the Council schools was 8,869 while there were none in private schools. The total number of students enrolled in the district was 8,869: 4,211 girls and 4,658 boys. The total number of qualified teachers was 445, 315 female and 130 male. There were around 23 temporary teachers, 10 male and 13 female. There were no untrained teachers in the district.

The total number of workers was 10,530: 6,334 male and 4,195 female.

==Administration==
Botswana gained independence from the British in 1966 and adapted the colonial administration framework to form its district administration. The policies were modified during 1970-74 to address some of the basic issues. The district is administered by a district administration and district council which are responsible for local administration. The policies for the administration are framed by the Ministry of Local Government. The major activities of the council are Tribal Administration, Remote Area Development and Local Governance. The executive powers of the council are vested on a commissioner appointed by the central government. Technical services wing of the Department of Local Government is responsible for developing roads, infrastructure in villages like water supply, schools and recreational facilities. All the staff of the local administration expect District Administration are selected via Unified Local Government Services (ULGS) and the Ministry of Local Government is responsible for their training, deployment and career development.

=== Sub-districts and Villages ===

<doc id="514258" wikidata="Q2995691" url="?curid=514258" title="Almost complex manifold">
<text>In mathematics, an almost complex manifold is a smooth manifold equipped with a smooth linear complex structure on each tangent space. Every complex manifold is an almost complex manifold, but there are almost complex manifolds that are not complex manifolds. Almost complex structures have important applications in symplectic geometry.

The concept is due to Charles Ehresmann and Heinz Hopf in the 1940s.

== Formal definition ==
Let &quot;M&quot; be a smooth manifold. An almost complex structure &quot;J&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is a linear complex structure (that is, a linear map which squares to −1) on each tangent space of the manifold, which varies smoothly on the manifold. In other words, we have a smooth tensor field &quot;J&quot; of degree such that formula_1 when regarded as a vector bundle isomorphism formula_2 on the tangent bundle. A manifold equipped with an almost complex structure is called an almost complex manifold.

If &quot;M&quot; admits an almost complex structure, it must be even-dimensional. This can be seen as follows. Suppose &quot;M&quot; is &quot;n&quot;-dimensional, and let be an almost complex structure. If then . But if &quot;M&quot; is a real manifold, then is a real number – thus &quot;n&quot; must be even if &quot;M&quot; has an almost complex structure. One can show that it must be orientable as well.

An easy exercise in linear algebra shows that any even dimensional vector space admits a linear complex structure. Therefore, an even dimensional manifold always admits a -rank tensor &quot;pointwise&quot; (which is just a linear transformation on each tangent space) such that at each point &quot;p&quot;. Only when this local tensor can be patched together to be defined globally does the pointwise linear complex structure yield an almost complex structure, which is then uniquely determined. The possibility of this patching, and therefore existence of an almost complex structure on a manifold &quot;M&quot; is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle from to . The existence question is then a purely algebraic topological one and is fairly well understood.

==Examples==
For every integer n, the flat space R2&quot;n&quot; admits an almost complex structure. An example for such an almost complex structure is (1 ≤ &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; ≤ 2&quot;n&quot;): formula_3 for odd &quot;i&quot;, formula_4 for even &quot;i&quot;.

The only spheres which admit almost complex structures are S2 and S6 (). In particular, S4 cannot be given an almost complex 
structure (Ehresmann and Hopf). In the case of S2, the almost complex structure comes from an honest complex structure on the Riemann sphere. The 6-sphere, S6, when considered as the set of unit norm imaginary octonions, inherits an almost complex structure from the octonion multiplication; the question of whether it has a complex structure is known as the &quot;Hopf problem,&quot; after Heinz Hopf.

== Differential topology of almost complex manifolds ==
Just as a complex structure on a vector space &quot;V&quot; allows a decomposition of &quot;V&quot;C into &quot;V&quot;+ and &quot;V&quot;− (the eigenspaces of &quot;J&quot; corresponding to +&quot;i&quot; and −&quot;i&quot;, respectively), so an almost complex structure on &quot;M&quot; allows a decomposition of the complexified tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot;C (which is the vector bundle of complexified tangent spaces at each point) into &quot;TM&quot;+ and &quot;TM&quot;−. A section of &quot;TM&quot;+ is called a vector field of type (1, 0), while a section of &quot;TM&quot;− is a vector field of type (0, 1). Thus &quot;J&quot; corresponds to multiplication by &quot;i&quot; on the (1, 0)-vector fields of the complexified tangent bundle, and multiplication by −&quot;i&quot; on the (0, 1)-vector fields.

Just as we build differential forms out of exterior powers of the cotangent bundle, we can build exterior powers of the complexified cotangent bundle (which is canonically isomorphic to the bundle of dual spaces of the complexified tangent bundle). The almost complex structure induces the decomposition of each space of &quot;r&quot;-forms

:formula_5

In other words, each Ω&quot;r&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)C admits a decomposition into a sum of Ω(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;)(&quot;M&quot;), with &quot;r&quot; = &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;.

As with any direct sum, there is a canonical projection π&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; from Ω&quot;r&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)C to Ω(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;). We also have the exterior derivative &quot;d&quot; which maps Ω&quot;r&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)C to Ω&quot;r&quot;+1(&quot;M&quot;)C. Thus we may use the almost complex structure to refine the action of the exterior derivative to the forms of definite type

:formula_6
:formula_7

so that formula_8 is a map which increases the holomorphic part of the type by one (takes forms of type (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) to forms of type (&quot;p&quot;+1, &quot;q&quot;)), and formula_9 is a map which increases the antiholomorphic part of the type by one. These operators are called the Dolbeault operators.

Since the sum of all the projections must be the identity map, we note that the exterior derivative can be written

:formula_10

== Integrable almost complex structures ==
Every complex manifold is itself an almost complex manifold. In local holomorphic coordinates formula_11 one can define the maps

:formula_12

(just like a counterclockwise rotation of π/2) or

:formula_13

One easily checks that this map defines an almost complex structure. Thus any complex structure on a manifold yields an almost complex structure, which is said to be &#x27;induced&#x27; by the complex structure, and the complex structure is said to be &#x27;compatible with&#x27; the almost complex structure.

The converse question, whether the almost complex structure implies the existence of a complex structure is much less trivial, and not true in general. On an arbitrary almost complex manifold one can always find coordinates for which the almost complex structure takes the above canonical form at any given point &quot;p&quot;. In general, however, it is not possible to find coordinates so that &quot;J&quot; takes the canonical form on an entire neighborhood of &quot;p&quot;. Such coordinates, if they exist, are called &#x27;local holomorphic coordinates for J&#x27;. If &quot;M&quot; admits local holomorphic coordinates for &quot;J&quot; around every point then these patch together to form a holomorphic atlas for &quot;M&quot; giving it a complex structure, which moreover induces &quot;J&quot;. &quot;J&quot; is then said to be &#x27;integrable&#x27;. If &quot;J&quot; is induced by a complex structure, then it is induced by a unique complex structure.

Given any linear map &quot;A&quot; on each tangent space of &quot;M&quot;; i.e., &quot;A&quot; is a tensor field of rank (1, 1), then the Nijenhuis tensor is a tensor field of rank (1,2) given by

:formula_14

or, for the usual case of an almost complex structure &quot;A=J&quot; such that formula_15,

:formula_16

The individual expressions on the right depend on the choice of the smooth vector fields &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, but the left side actually depends only on the pointwise values of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, which is why &quot;N&quot;&quot;A&quot; is a tensor. This is also clear from the component formula

:formula_17

In terms of the Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket, which generalizes the Lie bracket of vector fields, the Nijenhuis tensor &quot;NA&quot; is just one-half of [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;].

The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem states that an almost complex structure &quot;J&quot; is integrable if and only if &quot;NJ&quot; = 0. The compatible complex structure is unique, as discussed above. Since the existence of an integrable almost complex structure is equivalent to the existence of a complex structure, this is sometimes taken as the definition of a complex structure.

There are several other criteria which are equivalent to the vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensor, and which therefore furnish methods for checking the integrability of an almost complex structure (and in fact each of these can be found in the literature):

*The Lie bracket of any two (1, 0)-vector fields is again of type (1, 0)
*formula_18
*formula_19

Any of these conditions implies the existence of a unique compatible complex structure.

The existence of an almost complex structure is a topological question and is relatively easy to answer, as discussed above. The existence of an integrable almost complex structure, on the other hand, is a much more difficult analytic question. For example, it is still not known whether S6 admits an integrable almost complex structure, despite a long history of ultimately unverified claims. Smoothness issues are important. For real-analytic &quot;J&quot;, the Newlander–Nirenberg theorem follows from the Frobenius theorem; for &quot;C&quot;∞ (and less smooth) &quot;J&quot;, analysis is required (with more difficult techniques as the regularity hypothesis weakens).

== Compatible triples ==
Suppose &quot;M&quot; is equipped with a symplectic form &quot;ω&quot;, a Riemannian metric &quot;g&quot;, and an almost complex structure &quot;J&quot;. Since &quot;ω&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are nondegenerate, each induces a bundle isomorphism &quot;TM → T*M&quot;, where the first map, denoted &quot;φ&quot;&quot;ω&quot;, is given by the interior product &quot;φ&quot;&quot;ω&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) = &quot;i&quot;&quot;u&quot;&quot;ω&quot; = &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;u&quot;, •) and the other, denoted &quot;φ&quot;&quot;g&quot;, is given by the analogous operation for &quot;g&quot;. With this understood, the three structures (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;, &quot;J&quot;) form a compatible triple when each structure can be specified by the two others as follows:
*&quot;g&quot;(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) = &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;Jv&quot;)
*ω(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;Ju&quot;, &quot;v&quot;)
*&quot;J&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) = (&quot;φ&quot;&quot;g&quot;)−1(&quot;φ&quot;&quot;ω&quot;(&quot;u&quot;)).
In each of these equations, the two structures on the right hand side are called compatible when the corresponding construction yields a structure of the type specified. For example, &quot;ω&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are compatible if and only if &quot;ω&quot;(•, &quot;J&quot;•) is a Riemannian metric. The bundle on &quot;M&quot; whose sections are the almost complex structures compatible to &quot;ω&quot; has contractible fibres: the complex structures on the tangent fibres compatible with the restriction to the symplectic forms.

Using elementary properties of the symplectic form &quot;ω&quot;, one can show that a compatible almost complex structure &quot;J&quot; is an almost Kähler structure for the Riemannian metric &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;Jv&quot;). Also, if &quot;J&quot; is integrable, then (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;, &quot;J&quot;) is a Kähler manifold.

These triples are related to the 2 out of 3 property of the unitary group.

== Generalized almost complex structure ==
Nigel Hitchin introduced the notion of a generalized almost complex structure on the manifold &quot;M&quot;, which was elaborated in the doctoral dissertations of his students Marco Gualtieri and Gil Cavalcanti. An ordinary almost complex structure is a choice of a half-dimensional subspace of each fiber of the complexified tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot;. A generalized almost complex structure is a choice of a half-dimensional isotropic subspace of each fiber of the direct sum of the complexified tangent and cotangent bundles. In both cases one demands that the direct sum of the subbundle and its complex conjugate yield the original bundle.

An almost complex structure integrates to a complex structure if the half-dimensional subspace is closed under the Lie bracket. A generalized almost complex structure integrates to a generalized complex structure if the subspace is closed under the Courant bracket. If furthermore this half-dimensional space is the annihilator of a nowhere vanishing pure spinor then &quot;M&quot; is a generalized Calabi–Yau manifold.

<text>The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada. It was founded by Ronald Deibert in 2001. The laboratory studies information controls that impact the openness and security of the Internet and that pose threats to human rights. The organization uses a &quot;mixed methods&quot; approach which combines computer-generated interrogation, data mining, and analysis with intensive field research, qualitative social science, and legal and policy analysis methods. The organization has played a major role in providing technical support to journalists investigating the use of NSO Group&#x27;s Pegasus spyware on journalists, politicians and human rights advocates.

== History ==
The Citizen Lab was a founding partner of the OpenNet Initiative (2002–2013) and the Information Warfare Monitor (2002–2012) projects. The organization also developed the original design of the Psiphon censorship circumvention software, which was spun out of the Lab into a private Canadian corporation (Psiphon Inc.) in 2008.

In a 2009 report &quot;Tracking GhostNet&quot;, researchers uncovered a suspected cyber espionage network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries between 2007 and 2009, a high percentage of which were high-value targets, including ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The study was one of the first public reports to reveal a cyber espionage network that targeted civil society and government systems internationally.

In &quot;Shadows in the Cloud&quot; (2010), researchers documented a complex ecosystem of cyber espionage that systematically compromised government, business, academic, and other computer network systems in India, the offices of the Dalai Lama, the United Nations, and several other countries. 

In &quot;Million Dollar Dissident&quot;, published in August 2016, researchers discovered that Ahmed Mansoor, one of the UAE Five, a human rights defender in the United Arab Emirates, was targeted with Pegasus software developed by Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group. Prior to the releases of the report, researchers contacted Apple who released a security update that patched the vulnerabilities exploited by the spyware operators. Mansoor was imprisoned one year later and as of 2021, is still in jail.

Researchers reported in October 2018, that NSO Group surveillance software was used to spy on the &quot;inner circle&quot; of Jamal Khashoggi just before his murder, &quot;are being targeted in turn by international undercover operatives.&quot; A Citizen Lab October report revealed that NSO&#x27;s &quot;signature spy software&quot; which had been placed on the iPhone of Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, one of Khashoggi&#x27;s confidantes, months before. Abdulaziz said that Saudi Arabia spies used the hacking software to reveal Khashoggi&#x27;s &quot;private criticisms of the Saudi royal family&quot;. He said this &quot;played a major role&quot; in his death.

According to a January 24, 2019 &quot;AP News&quot; report, Citizen Lab researchers were &quot;being targeted&quot; by &quot;international undercover operatives&quot; for its work on NSO Group.

In January 2019, Citizen Lab invited the Associated Press to help reveal an undercover spy operation targeting reporters at Citizen Lab carried out by the firm Black Cube. Ronan Farrow added to this reporting through interviews with a source of his who was involved in that espionage incident, among others.

In March 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Citizen Lab had been a target of the UAE contractor DarkMatter.

A major international investigation from 2020-2022 into the use of Pegasus spyware on journalists, politicians and human rights activists around the world relied on Citizen Lab and Amnesty International&#x27;s Security Lab for technical support.

In 2021, Citizen Lab along with Amnesty International&#x27;s Security Lab analysed Front Line Defenders&#x27; report on the hacking of devices of six Palestinian human rights defenders (two were dual nationals; one French, one American) working for civil society organisations based in the West Bank. Four of the hacked devices used Israeli SIM cards (which NSO Group claimed was not allowed).

In 2023, Citizen Lab found evidence of NSO Group&#x27;s hacking tool Pegasus in a war setting for the first time as well as in the device of a lead investigator of a Mexican human rights investigation.

<text>Wrigley Rooftops is a name for the sixteen rooftops of residential buildings which have bleachers or seating on them to view baseball games or other major events at Wrigley Field. Since 1914 Wrigley roofs have dotted the neighborhood of Wrigleyville around Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play Major League Baseball. Venues on Waveland Avenue overlook left field, while those along Sheffield Avenue have a view over right field.

The rooftops had always been a gathering place for free views of the game, but until the 1980s, the observers were usually just a few dozen people watching from the flat rooftops, windows and porches of the buildings, with &quot;seating&quot; consisting of a few folding chairs, and with little commercial impact on the team. When the popularity of the Cubs began to rise in the 1980s, formal seating structures began to appear, and building owners began charging admission, much to the displeasure of Cubs management, who saw it as an unreasonable encroachment.
Various methods of combating this phenomenon were discussed. The idea of a &quot;spite fence&quot;, as with Shibe Park in Philadelphia, or the Cubs&#x27; previous home, West Side Park, was discussed. The idea was not implemented, nor was it fully abandoned. Before Opening Day in 2002, a &quot;wind screen&quot; was temporarily erected on the ballpark&#x27;s back screen behind the outfield wall, obscuring some of the view from Wrigley roofs.

When the majority were independent of Cub affiliate ownership prior to 2016, the Wrigleyville Rooftops Association&#x27;s members were the 16 rooftop venues. Wrigley Rooftops is the Ricketts family&#x27;s marketing arm and brand for their rooftop holdings through Greystone Sheffield Holdings and Hickory Street Capital.

==History==

Soon after Wrigley opened in 1914, the rooftops sprung up around the ball field. In the 1938 World Series, when the Cubs played the Yankees, The Sheffield Baseball Club was the first to charge for admission.

Real estate investor Donal Barry, through an entity, purchased in 2000 1010 W. Waveland (Beyond the Ivy I) then 1048 W. Waveland (originally Beyond The Ivy III, then Sky Lounge Wrigley Rooftop now 1048 Sky Lounge) also in 2000. Barry&#x27;s entity in 2004 purchased 1038 W. Waveland (Beyond The Ivy II).

In 2002, the Cubs organization filed a lawsuit against the different facilities for copyright infringement. Since operators charge admission to use their amenities and sell licenses to view Major League Baseball, the Cubs asserted that the facilities were illegally using a copyrighted game and sued for royalties. In 2004, 11 of the 13 roofs settled with the club out of court, agreeing to pay 17% of gross revenue in exchange for official endorsement. The city also began investigating the structural integrity of the roofs, issuing citations to those in danger of collapse. With the Cubs and the neighbors reaching agreement, many of the facilities began to feature seating structures: some with bleachers, some with chair seats, and even one with a steel-girdered &quot;double deck&quot; of seats (see photo). The agreement was to last until 2023.
In 2013, principal owner Thomas S. Ricketts sought Commission on Chicago Landmarks permission to build &quot;additional seating, new lighting, four additional LED signs of up to and a video board in right field.&quot; Ricketts said Wrigley has &quot;the worst player facilities in Major League Baseball&quot;. When the roof owners threatened to sue he tempered the design to just &quot;a sign in right field and a video board in left field.&quot; After the roof owners did not rescind their threat to sue, Ricketts said in May 2014 that he would attempt to proceed with the original plan even if the matter was fought in court. The Wrigleyville Rooftop Association claim in 2014 that its members spend $50 million to renovate their venues to code after agreeing to revenue-sharing. On January 20, 2015, the roof owners filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Cubs and Ricketts, citing breach of contract. 

The Ricketts family, owners of the Cubs, began purchasing the rooftop properties in order to control the marketable sight lines into the stadium and by the end of the 2016 season, owned (or controlled via agreement) 11 of the rooftop locations. This led to a dispute with the Major League Baseball Players Association and other MLB clubs, which argued that these acquisitions made the rooftops&#x27; receipts baseball-related revenue for the purposes of revenue sharing.

In 2015, a family venture bought 3643 N. Sheffield Ave. building, 3639 N. Sheffield and 1032 W. Waveland. A Jerry Lasky-managed entity sold 3617, 3619 and 3637 N. Sheffield to the Ricketts in May 2015. Hickory Street Capital, a venture of the Ricketts family, took a stake in the Down the Line Rooftop (3621-3625 Sheffield Ave.) along with right of first refusal in 2010. James and Camelia Petrozzini moved their share of Down the Line to a living trust then the Petrozzini died in 2014. Hickory Street sued that the trust transfer violated the right of first refusal. Ricketts family ventures outright purchased seven rooftop buildings while purchase the mortgages on three Sheffield rooftop properties in receivership. The Petrozzini Trust agreed to sell Down the Line Rooftop to Hickory Street in December 2016. Ricketts family&#x27;s Greystone Sheffield Holdings bought the three W. Waveland rooftops from Donal Barry on January 13, 2016. Also in January, the Ricketts launched its Wrigley Rooftops marketing brand and arm. The Ricketts family add the Brixen Ivy located at 1044 W Waveland to its rooftop portfolio.

In May 2017, the Cubs and the Rickets family formed Marquee Sports &amp; Entertainment as a central sales and marketing company for the various Rickets family sports and entertainment assets, the Cubs, Wrigley Rooftops and Hickory Street Capital. As part of this process, the Cubs agreed to count the rooftops&#x27; revenues along with regular Wrigley Field receipts for the purposes of revenue sharing.

==Hickory Street Capital==
Hickory Street Capital is a Wrigleyville development company owned by the Joe Ricketts family.

Hickory Street Capital, a venture of the Ricketts family, took a stake in the Down the Line Rooftop (3621-3625 Sheffield Ave.) along with right of first refusal in 2010. James and Camelia Petrozzini moved their share of Down the Line to a living trust then the Petrozzini died in 2014. Hickory Street sued that the trust transfer violated the right of first refusal. Ricketts family ventures outright purchased seven rooftop buildings while purchase the mortgages on three Sheffield rooftop properties in receivership. The Petrozzini Trust agreed to sell Down the Line Rooftop to Hickory Street in December 2016 

In May 2017, the Cubs and the Rickets family formed Marquee Sports &amp; Entertainment as a central sales and marketing company for the various Rickets family sports and entertainment assets, the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Rooftops and Hickory Street Capital.

The Hotel Wrigley project was announced by Hickory Street Capital in 2013 for the northwest corner of Clark and Addison across from Wrigley Field with a faux-historic baseball theme. In September 2016, the project was rechristened Hotel Zachary after the 1914 ballpark’s architect Zachary Taylor Davis with a new design by architect VOA Associates. Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts was brought on board to manage the hotel expect to open in 2018. On April 10, 2017, the Park at Wrigley outdoor plaza was opened to the public on the same day as the Chicago Cubs&#x27; home opener.

<text>&quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant Massacree&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, is a satirical talking blues song by singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie, released as the title track to his 1967 debut album &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;. The song is a deadpan protest against the Vietnam War draft, in the form of a comically exaggerated but largely true story from Guthrie&#x27;s own life: while visiting acquaintances in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, he is arrested and convicted of dumping trash illegally, which later endangers his suitability for the military draft. The title refers to a restaurant owned by one of Guthrie&#x27;s friends, artist Alice Brock. Although Brock is a minor character in the story, the restaurant plays no role in it aside from being the subject of the chorus and the impetus for Guthrie&#x27;s visit.

The song inspired the 1969 film &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, which starred Guthrie and took numerous liberties with the story. The work has become Guthrie&#x27;s signature song and he has periodically re-released it with updated lyrics. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The song consists of a protracted spoken monologue, with a constantly repeated fingerstyle Piedmont blues ragtime guitar backing and light brush-on-snare drum percussion (the drummer on the record is uncredited). This is bookended by a short chorus about the titular restaurant. Arlo Guthrie has used the brief &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; bookends and guitar backing for other monologues bearing the &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; name. 

The track lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds, occupying the entire A-side of the &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; album. Due to Guthrie&#x27;s rambling and circuitous telling with unimportant details, it has been described as a shaggy dog story.

Guthrie refers to the incident as a &quot;&quot;, a colloquialism originating in the Ozark Mountains that describes &quot;an event so wildly and improbably and baroquely messed up that the results are almost impossible to believe&quot;. It is a corruption of the word &quot;&quot;, but carries a much lighter and more sarcastic connotation, rather than describing anything involving actual death.

==Story==

=== Prologue ===
Guthrie states that the song is titled &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; but clarifies that this is only the name of the song, not the business owned by his friend Alice Brock. He then sings the chorus, which is in the form of a jingle for the restaurant, beginning with &quot;You can get anything you want at Alice&#x27;s restaurant&quot; twice, and continuing with directions to it before restating the slogan once more.

===Part One===
Guthrie recounts events that took place in 1965 (two years prior to the time of the original recording), when he and a friend spent Thanksgiving Day at a deconsecrated church on the outskirts of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which their friends Alice and Ray Brock had been using as a home. As a favor to them, Guthrie and the friend volunteered to take their large accumulation of garbage to the local dump in their VW Microbus, not realizing until they arrived there that the dump would be closed for the holiday. They eventually noticed another pile of trash that had previously been dumped off a cliff near a side road, and added theirs to the accumulation before returning to the church for Thanksgiving dinner.

The next morning, the church received a phone call from the local police chief, &quot;Officer Obie&quot;, saying that an envelope in the garbage pile had been traced back to them. Guthrie, stating &quot;I cannot tell a lie&quot; and with tongue in cheek, confessed that he &quot;put that envelope underneath&quot; the garbage. He and his friend drove to the police station, expecting a verbal reprimand and to be required to clean up the garbage, but they were instead arrested, handcuffed, and taken to the scene of the crime. There, Obie and a crew of police officers from the surrounding areas collected extensive forensic evidence of the litter, including &quot;twenty-seven 8-by-10 color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was, to be used as evidence against us&quot; amid a media circus of local media trying to get news stories on the littering. The young men were briefly jailed, with Obie taking drastic precautions to prevent Guthrie from escaping or committing suicide. After a few hours, Alice bailed them out and held another Thanksgiving dinner.

Guthrie and his friend stood trial the next day. When Obie saw that the judge relied upon a seeing-eye dog, he realized that the officers&#x27; meticulous work had been foiled by a literal &quot;case of American blind justice&quot;, as the judge would not be able to see the evidence. Guthrie and his friend paid a fine of to the court, and were ordered to pick up the garbage, in the snow.

===Part Two===

Guthrie then states that the littering incident was &quot;not what I came to tell you about&quot; and shifts to another story, this one based at the Army Building on Whitehall Street in New York City as Guthrie appeared for a physical exam related to the Vietnam War draft. He tried various strategies to be found unfit for military service, including getting drunk the night before so he was hung over, and attempting to convince the psychiatrist that he was homicidal, which only earned him praise.

After several hours, Guthrie was asked whether he had ever been convicted of a crime. He nodded, began to tell his story, and was sent to the &quot;Group W&quot; bench to file for a moral waiver. The other convicts (&quot;mother-rapers... father-stabbers... father-rapers&quot;) were initially put off that his conviction had been for littering, but accepted him when he added &quot;and creating a nuisance&quot;. When Guthrie noticed one of the questions on the paperwork asked whether he had rehabilitated himself since the crime, he noted the irony of having to prove himself reformed from a crime of littering when the realities of war were often far more brutal. The officer in charge of the induction process commented, &quot;We don&#x27;t like your kind&quot;, rejecting Guthrie and sending his fingerprints to the federal government to be put on file.

=== Epilogue ===
In the final part of the song, Guthrie explains to the live audience that anyone finding themselves in a similar situation should walk into the military psychiatrist&#x27;s office, sing the opening line from the chorus and walk out. He predicts that a single person doing it would be rejected as &quot;sick&quot; and that two people doing it, in harmony, would be rejected as &quot;faggots&quot;, but that once three people started doing it they would begin to suspect &quot;an organization&quot; and 50 people a day would be recognized as &quot;the Alice&#x27;s Restaurant Anti-Massacree Movement&quot;. As he continues fingerpicking, he invites the audience to sing the chorus along with him &quot;the next time it comes around on the guitar&quot;. When they do so, Guthrie claims that their singing &quot;was horrible&quot;, and challenges them to sing it with him &quot;with four-part harmony and feeling&quot;. Guthrie and the crowd then sing the chorus, and the song concludes.

== Development ==
Guthrie cited the long-form monologues of Lord Buckley and Bill Cosby, and the movies of Charlie Chaplin, as inspirations for the song&#x27;s lyrics, and a number of different musicians (in particular Mississippi John Hurt) as inspirations for the Piedmont fingerstyle guitar accompaniment, noting that he took about &quot;two seconds&quot; to come up with the accompaniment because he wanted something easy to play mindlessly while narrating the story. The song was written as the events happened over the course of approximately one year; it grew out of a simple joke riff Guthrie had been working on in 1965 and 1966 before he appeared before the draft board (the opening was originally written as &quot;you can hide from Obanhein at Alice&#x27;s restaurant&quot;, which is how the restaurant got tied into the original story), and he later added his experience before the draft board to create the song as it is known today. Additional portions of the song were written during one of Guthrie&#x27;s many stays with the English songwriter and music journalist Karl Dallas and his family in London. Guthrie sent a demo recording of the song to his father Woody Guthrie on his deathbed; it was, according to a &quot;family joke&quot;, the last thing Woody heard before he died in October 1967. Because of the song&#x27;s length, Guthrie never expected it to be released, because such extended monologues were extremely rare in an era when singles were typically less than three minutes.

==Response==
=== 1960s ===

&quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; was first performed publicly with Guthrie singing live on &quot;Radio Unnameable&quot;, the overnight program hosted by Bob Fass that aired on New York radio station WBAI, one evening in February 1967, following a year of Guthrie honing the song at various small venues. (The exact date of the first recording has also been identified as 1966.) The initial performance was part of an impromptu supergroup at the WBAI studios that included David Bromberg, Jerry Jeff Walker and Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliot. Guthrie performed the song several times live on WBAI in 1967 before its commercial release. By May 1967, the song had proved so popular that at one point Fass (who was known for playing songs he liked over and over again in his graveyard slot) started playing a recording of one of Guthrie&#x27;s live performances of the song repeatedly; eventually the non-commercial station rebroadcast it only when listeners pledged to donate a large amount of money. (Fass subverted it and occasionally asked for donations to get him to &quot;stop&quot; playing the recording.)

&quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; was performed on July 17, 1967, at the Newport Folk Festival in a workshop or breakout section on &quot;topical songs&quot;, where it was such a hit that he was called upon to perform it for the entire festival audience. The song&#x27;s success at Newport and on WBAI led Guthrie to record it in front of a studio audience in New York City and release it as side one of the album &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; in October 1967. Guthrie noted that the studio recording combined some of the worst elements of both studio and live recording, in that the audience chosen for the record had already heard him perform the song repeatedly, but because of the audience, he had to record the song and album in one take.

The original album spent 16 weeks on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album chart, peaking at #29 during the week of March 2, 1968, then reentered the chart on December 27, 1969, after the film version was released, peaking that time at #63. In the wake of the film version, Guthrie recorded a more single-friendly edit of the chorus in 1969. Titled &quot;Alice&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll Restaurant&quot;, it included three verses, all of which advertise the restaurant, and a fiddle solo by country singer Doug Kershaw; to fit the song on a record, the monologue was removed, bringing the song&#x27;s length to 4:43. This version, backed with &quot;Ring Around the Rosy Rag&quot; (a cut from the &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; album), peaked at #97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and #64 in Canada. Because the single did not reach the popularity of the full version, which did not qualify for the Hot 100 because of its length, &quot;Billboard&quot; officially classifies Guthrie as a one-hit wonder for his later hit &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;.

After the release of the original album, Guthrie continued to perform the song in concert, regularly revising and updating the lyrics. In 1969, for instance, he performed a 20-minute rendition of the song that, instead of the original narrative, told a fictional story of how Russian and Chinese military operatives attempted to weaponize &quot;multicolored rainbow roaches&quot; they had found at Alice&#x27;s restaurant, and the Lyndon Johnson administration orchestrated a plan for the nation to defend itself. A recording of this version titled &quot;Alice: Before Time Began&quot; was released in 2009 on the album &quot;Tales of &#x27;69&quot; distributed by Guthrie&#x27;s Rising Son Records label; another recording of this version, titled &quot;The Alice&#x27;s Restaurant Multicolored Rainbow Roach Affair&quot;, was also released on that label. In 1970, the song was used as an anthem for WBAI&#x27;s sister station KPFT-FM in Houston, Texas, after that station had repeatedly been bombed by the Ku Klux Klan; Guthrie came and performed the song live after the station returned to the air following the second bombing.

=== Developing tradition ===

It has become a tradition for many classic rock and adult album alternative radio stations to play the song each Thanksgiving. Despite its mention of the slur &quot;faggots&quot;, radio stations generally present the song as originally recorded, and the Federal Communications Commission has never punished a station for playing it. When performing the song in later years, Guthrie began to change the line to something less offensive and often topical: during the 1990s and 2000s, the song alluded to the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; 1993 fourth season episode &quot;The Outing&quot; by saying &quot;They&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re gay—not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that,&quot; and in 2015, Guthrie used the line &quot;They&#x27;ll think they&#x27;re trying to get married in some parts of Kentucky&quot;, a nod to the controversy of the time surrounding county clerk Kim Davis. 

By the late 1970s, Guthrie had removed the song from his regular concert repertoire. In 1984, Guthrie, who was supporting George McGovern&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful comeback bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, revived &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; to protest the Reagan Administration&#x27;s reactivation of the Selective Service System registrations. That version has not been released on a commercial recording; at least one bootleg of it from one of Guthrie&#x27;s performances exists. It was this tour, which occurred near the 20th anniversary of the song (and continued as a general tour after McGovern dropped out of the race), that prompted Guthrie to return the song to his playlist every ten years, usually coinciding with the anniversary of either the song or the incident. The 30th anniversary version of the song includes a follow-up recounting how he learned that Richard Nixon had owned a copy of the song, and he jokingly suggested that this explained the famous 18½-minute gap in the Watergate tapes.

Guthrie rerecorded his entire debut album for his 1997 CD &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant: The Massacree Revisited&quot;, on the Rising Son label, which includes this expanded version. The 40th anniversary edition, performed at and released as a recording by the Kerrville Folk Festival, made note of some parallels between the 1960s and the Iraq War and George W. Bush administration. Guthrie revived the song for the 50th anniversary edition in 2015, which he expected would be the last time he would do so. In 2018, at which point he decided he was too old to care about overplaying the song anymore, Guthrie began the Alice&#x27;s Restaurant: Back by Popular Demand Tour, reuniting with members of his 1970s backing band Shenandoah. The tour, which features Guthrie&#x27;s daughter Sarah Lee Guthrie as the opening act, was scheduled to wrap up in 2020. To justify bringing the song back out of its usual ten-year sequence, he stated that he was doing so to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the film version of the song. The tour ended in 2019 and was later confirmed to have been Guthrie&#x27;s last; he suffered a career-ending stroke in November of that year and announced his retirement in October 2020.

===Artist&#x27;s reflections===

In a 2014 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Guthrie said he believed there are such things as just wars, and that the message of this song was targeted at the Vietnam War in particular. Interviews with Ron Bennington in 2009 and NPR in 2005 describe the song not so much as anti-war but as &quot;anti-stupidity&quot;. Guthrie considered the song as relevant in 2015 as it was in 1965, particularly in that Millennials and Generation Z were, much like the Baby Boomers of his era, beginning to coalesce as a bloc in opposition to the &quot;very sophisticated manipulation&quot; from major authority figures and institutions of the era, something that Guthrie believed Baby Boomers would find familiar.
==Historicity==
Most of the events of the story are true; the littering incident was recorded in the local newspaper at the time it happened, and although Guthrie made some minor embellishments, the persons mentioned in the first half of the story all granted interviews on the subject, mostly verifying that part of the story. The second half of the story does not have as much specific corroborating evidence to support it; the public exposure of COINTELPRO in 1971 confirmed that the federal government was collecting personal information on anti-war protesters as Guthrie alleged, and Guthrie&#x27;s father was known to have been on the FBI watchlists due to his Communist sympathies.

=== Alice, Ray and the restaurant ===
The Alice in the song was restaurant-owner Alice May Brock (1941–2024). In 1963, shortly after dropping out of Sarah Lawrence College, Alice used $2,000 supplied by her mother to purchase a deconsecrated church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where Alice and her husband, Ray Brock (1929–August 1, 1979), would live. Alice was a painter and designer, while Ray was an architect and woodworker who originally was from Hartfield, Virginia; the two had met while in Greenwich Village in 1962. Both worked at a nearby private academy, the music and art-oriented Stockbridge School, from which Guthrie (then of Howard Beach, a neighborhood in Queens, New York City) had graduated. 
Alice Brock operated a restaurant called &quot;The Back Room&quot; in 1966, at 40 Main Street in Stockbridge, located behind a grocery store and directly underneath the studios of Norman Rockwell. The Back Room was already closed by the time the song was released; it ceased operations in April 1966. (Theresa&#x27;s Stockbridge Café was last known to occupy the site; the café&#x27;s sign makes note that the space was &quot;formerly Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;. Theresa&#x27;s was closed by 2022, but the sign pointing to the restaurant remained.) After a breakup and abortive reconciliation, Alice divorced Ray in 1968; she went on to launch two more restaurants (a take-out window in Housatonic in 1971 and a much larger establishment in Lenox in the late 1970s) before leaving the restaurant business in 1979. Ray returned to Virginia after the divorce and took on various projects until his death in 1979.

Alice owned an art studio and gallery in Provincetown, Massachusetts, until 2016. She illustrated the 2004 children&#x27;s book &quot;Mooses Come Walking&quot;, written by Guthrie, and authored and illustrated another, &quot;How to Massage Your Cat&quot;.

In 1969, Random House published &quot;The Alice&#x27;s Restaurant Cookbook&quot; () which featured recipes and hippie wisdom from Alice Brock, as well as photos of Alice and Guthrie, and publicity stills from the movie. A tear-out record was included in the book with Brock and Guthrie bantering on two tracks, &quot;Italian-Type Meatballs&quot; and &quot;My Granma&#x27;s Beet Jam&quot;.

Brock, Guthrie and Rick Robbins reunited for Thanksgiving dinner in 2022, the first time all three of them had been together for Thanksgiving since the events depicted in the song (Guthrie has typically gone south for the winter but chose to stay in Massachusetts that year). Guthrie said of the experience: &quot;We had a nice Thanksgiving (, but) once was enough.&quot; Brock died November 21, 2024 following years of declining health.

===The church===
The church, originally built as the St. James Chapel in 1829, was enlarged in 1866 and renamed Trinity Church. Ray and Alice Brock purchased the property in 1963 and made it their home. Alice sold the building shortly after the film adaptation was released, commenting that the song and film had brought a great deal of unwanted publicity. The building changed ownership several times in the 1970s and 1980s until Guthrie bought the facility in 1991 and converted it to the Guthrie Center, a nondenominational, interfaith meeting place.

In the main chapel area is a stage on which Officer Obie&#x27;s chair sits as a reminder of the arrest. A set of private rooms in which Alice and Ray once lived remains.

In later years, the Guthrie Center became a folk music venue, hosting a Thursday evening hootenanny as well as the Troubadour Concert series annually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Musical guests have included John Gorka, Tom Paxton, Ellis Paul, Tom Rush, The Highwaymen folk group and Arlo Guthrie. The Troubadour series helps to support the church&#x27;s free community lunch program which is held at the church every Wednesday at noon. On Thanksgiving, the church hosts a &quot;Thanksgiving dinner that can&#x27;t be beat&quot; for the local community. The annual &quot;Garbage Trail Walk&quot;, retracing the steps of Arlo and folksinger Rick Robbins (as told in the song), raises money for Huntington&#x27;s disease research.

The folding table on which Guthrie had written the first lines of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; remained in Alice Brock&#x27;s possession, the only item she still held from her time in the area at the time she died.

=== The littering incident ===
The incident which Guthrie recounts in the first half of the song was reported in &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot; on November 29, 1965. It describes the conviction of Richard J. Robbins, age 19, and Arlo Guthrie, age 18, for illegally disposing of rubbish, and a fine of $25 each, plus an order to remove the trash. The arresting officer was Stockbridge police chief William J. Obanhein (&quot;Officer Obie&quot;), and the trial was presided over by Special Judge James E. Hannon. It identifies the incriminating evidence as an envelope addressed to a male resident of Great Barrington (presumably Ray Brock) rather than Guthrie. In a 1972 interview with &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Music Scene&quot;, Obanhein denied handcuffing Guthrie and Robbins. He also said the real reason there was no toilet seat in the jail cell was to prevent such items from being stolen, not as a suicide deterrent as Guthrie had joked. Guthrie also admitted in 2020 that the police photographs were in black-and-white, not in color. The Microbus that Guthrie and Robbins used to dispose of the garbage was eventually scrapped; the Guthrie Center later acquired a replica that Guthrie occasionally drives.

===The draft===
The Armed Forces Examination and Entrance Station was part of a large complex at 39 Whitehall Street in New York City from 1884 to 1969. By the late 1960s, the building had become a target for anti-war protesters, and two bombings left minor damage to the building, prompting the building to be vacated. The building has since been repurposed as a mixed-use development and its address changed (it is now 3 New York Plaza).

The brief mention of &quot;faggots&quot; being rejected for military service in the song&#x27;s epilogue was based on military policy at the time, which rejected all homosexuals and expelled anyone caught engaging in homosexual behavior with a section 8 dishonorable discharge. The policy was modified in 1993 and fully repealed in 2012.

Guthrie acknowledged that he was never in danger of being drafted because he had been given a high draft number. A friend commented that he and Guthrie were &quot;not going to get called unless there&#x27;s a squirrel invasion in New Hampshire.&quot;

==Legacy==

Alice&#x27;s Restaurant of Sky Londa, California, founded in the 1960s, was originally founded by Alice Taylor with no connection to Alice Brock. Subsequent owners of the restaurant kept the original name as a homage to the song, eventually adding a &quot;Group W bench,&quot; because the name had made the restaurant a tourist attraction that was &quot;good for business.&quot;

Smalltalk the programming language was written around the same time. The song played a minor role that lives on today. The choices to adopt some of the language in the song has spread to other languages that may not even know that Alice&#x27;s Restaurant helped to inspire. The lyrics: &quot;They got a building down New York City, it’s called Whitehall Street, Where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected.&quot; helped shape the programming methods #inject #inspect #detect, #select. 

==Feature film==

The song was adapted into the 1969 movie &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, directed and co-written by Arthur Penn, who had heard the song in 1967 while living in Stockbridge and immediately wanted to make the song into a movie. Guthrie appears as himself, with Pat Quinn as Alice Brock and James Broderick as Ray Brock, William Obanhein and James Hannon appearing as themselves, and Alice Brock making a cameo appearance.

The film was released in August 1969, a few days after Guthrie appeared at the Woodstock Festival, and a soundtrack album was released by United Artists Records. The soundtrack includes a studio version of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, which was originally divided into two parts (one for each album side). A compact disc reissue on the Rykodisc label presents this version in full and adds several bonus tracks to the original LP.

<doc id="514269" wikidata="Q6672465" url="?curid=514269" title="Sipi Falls">
<text>Sipi Falls is a series of three waterfalls located on the north-western slopes of the eponymous extinct volcano, Mount Elgon, in Uganda, with views over the Karamoja plains. The falls are situated to the northeast of Sironko and Mbale, adjacent to Mount Elgon National Park, which is located 1.7 kilometers (1 mile) away from the Kenyan border. The falls account for 10% to 20% of all tourist visits to Uganda every year.

At its highest point, the largest of the three waterfalls, known as Sipi Falls, stands at 95 meters (312 feet) high. The middle waterfall – known as Simba Falls, lies further upstream to the east. This waterfall has a drop of 74 m (243 ft). Further uphill is the third waterfall, known as Ngasire Falls, with a drop of approximately 85 m (262 ft).

== Location ==
The falls are located two miles northeast of the town of Sipi, 273.6 km (170 mi) northeast of the Ugandan capital of Kampala. The falls were formed by the Sipi River flowing from the upper slopes of Mount Elgon, and terminate in the Lake Kyoga basin.

== Name origin ==
The term &quot;Sipi&quot; is thought to have its origins in the local word &quot;sep&quot;, which denotes an indigenous plant resembling a wild banana after the Sipi River. This plant is commonly found along the Sipi riverbank and is characterized by its translucent, green fronds featuring a crimson rib, giving it an appearance reminiscent of a wild banana. The plant is also used as a medicine for treating fevers and measles by the local people in the area.

== Economy ==
The Sipi Falls area grows Bugisu Arabica coffee, which is profitable for the local people.

<doc id="514294" wikidata="Q4777048" url="?curid=514294" title="Antônio da Costa Santos">
<text>Antônio da Costa Santos (also known as Toninho; 4 March 1952 – 10 September 2001) was a Brazilian architect and politician of the Workers&#x27; Party (PT).

Toninho took office as Mayor of Campinas (the third largest city in the state of São Paulo, with over 1,000,000 inhabitants), on 1 January 2001. He was shot to death at 10:15 pm, 10 September 2001, as he was driving home alone from a shopping mall. The details and motives of his murder, which stunned the country, is still largely unknown . His assassination was overshadowed by the deadly 9/11 attacks on the US approximately a day later.

Toninho was succeeded in office by the vice-Mayor, Izalene Tiene. He left a daughter and a widow.

==Murder investigations==
The murder took place in a poorly lit access road leading out of the mall. Witnesses in other cars only said to have seen a silver Vectra driving at high speed and heard shots. Two bullets shattered his car&#x27;s windows and the last hit him on his left shoulder. Another car (a green Vectra) had been the object of a robbery attempt a few minutes before, on the same route.

===Local police version===
Initial investigations by the Campinas Civil Police promptly led to accusations against four local criminals. Robber Anderson Rogério Davi or &quot;Boca&quot;, 20, was arrested on 5 October, and he pointed to three other accomplices, and two of them (Flávio Roberto Mendes Clara, 19 and A.S.C, 17) were arrested on 10 October. According to the police, the men confessed that they were driving two motorcycles, looking for a car to rob. They overtook Toninho&#x27;s car, but as he accelerated instead of stopping, Flávio would have shot him. A 38 caliber weapon found with Flávio would have been the crime weapon.

===Federal police version===
However, subsequent investigations by the Brazilian Federal Police showed that the confessions and evidence were invalid. Federal investigators instead attributed the murder to accomplices of a certain Wanderson de Paula Lima, nicknamed Andinho, who at the time was among the police&#x27;s most wanted for a number of crimes. The main clue was a match between the bullets (9 mm and caliber 45) recovered from Toninho&#x27; murder scene and from the kidnapping of an 8-year-old boy in Campinas, four days after the murder.

Wanderson was arrested on 25 February 2002, in Itu. According to the police, a 9 mm pistol found in Andinho&#x27;s hideout matched that used on Toninho and on the kidnapping. The police claimed that three men from Andinho&#x27;s gang, driving a silver Vectra, had attempted to stop a green Vectra shortly before Toninho&#x27;s murder, intending to carry out a flash kidnapping. The green Vectra was hit by caliber 45 bullets and showed silver paint streaks from an attempt by the robbers to block its path, which also smashed one of the robbers&#x27; car headlights. This detail is confirmed by a security camera from the mall that recorded a car with one headlight off. While running away from that crime, the robbers ran into the Mayor&#x27;s car, and either attempted to rob it too, or were irritated because Toninho was driving at the speed limit and blocking their way.

However, the three suspects had already been killed by the police before they could be interrogated. Two of them (Valmir Conti or &quot;Valmirzinho&quot;, 29, and Anderson José Bastos or &quot;Alemãozinho&quot;, 22) were hiding with other two alleged members of Wanderson&#x27;s gang in an apartment in Caraguatatuba. All four men died on 2 October 2001 in a shootout with a team from the Campinas Civil Police. No policemen were hurt. On 26 January 2006, two members of that team were formally indicted by the São Paulo&#x27;s Public Attorney for connections to Wanderson&#x27;s gang.

===Political crime===
The police have always maintained that Toninho&#x27;s murder was a common crime and that the criminals were not aware of the victim&#x27;s identity. However, suspicions that the murder may have been targeted and may have had political motives were widespread, and have increased recently. Just before his death, Toninho had started investigations on alleged overbudgeting in contracts with urban cleaning companies. Toninho said he had received death threats, but was not going to be intimidated by them. The murder of Celso Daniel, mayor of Santo André and also a PT member, a few months later (22 January 2002) also contributed to these suspicions.

Toninho&#x27;s widow Roseana recently complained angrily against President Lula&#x27;s alleged lack of interest in her husband&#x27;s murder investigations.

<doc id="514297" wikidata="Q403645" url="?curid=514297" title="Aichi B7A">
<text>The was a large and powerful carrier-borne torpedo-dive bomber produced by Aichi Kokuki for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during the Second World War. Built in only small numbers and deprived of the aircraft carriers it was intended to operate from, the type had little chance to distinguish itself in combat before the war ended in August 1945.

==Design and development==
The B7A &quot;Ryusei&quot; (originally designated AM-23 by Aichi) was designed in response to a 1941 16-Shi requirement issued by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for a carrier attack bomber that would replace both the Nakajima B6N &quot;Tenzan&quot; torpedo plane and the Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot; dive bomber in IJN service. It was intended for use aboard a new generation of &quot;Taihō&quot;-class carriers, the first of which was laid down in July 1941. Because the deck elevators on the &quot;Taihō&quot;s had a larger square area than those of older Japanese carriers, the longstanding maximum limit of on carrier aircraft length could now be lifted.

Chief Engineer Toshio Ozaki (name often seen as Norio Ozaki, but this is incorrect because the Kanji for both first names are the same and often confused) chose a mid-wing arrangement for the B7A to provide for an internal bomb-bay and to ensure enough clearance for the plane&#x27;s four-bladed propeller. This in turn necessitated the adoption of an inverted gull wing, similar to the F4U Corsair, in order to shorten the length of the main landing gear. The wing featured extendable ailerons with a ten-degree range of deflection, enabling them to act as auxiliary flaps. Dive brakes were fitted underneath just outboard of the fuselage. The B7A&#x27;s outer wing panels were designed to fold upwards hydraulically for carrier stowage, reducing its overall span from to approximately .

Selection of a powerplant was dictated by the Japanese Navy, which requested that Aichi design the aircraft around the 1,360 kW (1,825 hp) Nakajima NK9C &quot;Homare&quot; 12 18-cylinder two-row air-cooled radial engine. This was expected to become the Navy&#x27;s standard aircraft engine in the 1,340 kW (1,800 hp) to 1,641 kW (2,200 hp) range. One production model B7A2 was later fitted with a 1,491 kW (2,000 hp) Nakajima &quot;Homare&quot; 23 radial engine and plans were also made to fit the 1,641 kW (2,200 hp) Mitsubishi MK9 radial to an advanced version of the &quot;Ryusei&quot; (designated B7A3 &quot;Ryusei Kai&quot;) but the latter effort never came to fruition.

The B7A had a weight-carrying capacity stemming from its requirements, resulting in a weapons load no greater than its predecessors. The presence of an internal bomb bay with two high-load-capability attachment points allowed the aircraft to carry two 250 kg (550 lb) or six 60 kg (132 lb) bombs. Alternatively, it could carry a single externally mounted Type 91 torpedo, weighing up to 848 kg (1,870 lb).

Defensive armament initially consisted of two 20mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons in the wing roots and one flexible 7.92mm Type 1 machine-gun mounted in the rear cockpit. Later production models of the B7A2 featured a 13mm Type 2 machine-gun in place of the 7.92mm gun.

Despite the plane&#x27;s weight and size, it displayed fighter-like handling and performance, beating the version of the A6M Zero in service at the time. It was fast and highly maneuverable.

Given the codename &quot;Grace&quot; by the Allies, the B7A first flew as a prototype in May 1942, but teething problems with the experimental NK9C &quot;Homare&quot; engine and necessary modifications to the airframe meant that the type did not enter into production until two years later in May 1944. Nine prototype B7A1s were built and 80 production version B7A2s completed by Aichi before a severe earthquake in May 1945 destroyed the factory at Funakata where they were being assembled. A further 25 examples were produced at the 21st Naval Air Arsenal at Omura.

==Operational history==
In June 1944, the &quot;Taihō&quot; was the only Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft carrier then modern enough to operate the B7A &quot;Ryusei&quot; in its intended role. Other Japanese carriers lacked the modern arresting gear necessary to assist the recovery of aircraft weighing over 4000 kg. However, &quot;Taiho&quot; was sunk during the Battle of the Philippine Sea before enough B7As were even available to embark. Afterward, the B7A was relegated to operating from land bases, primarily with the Yokosuka and 752nd Air Groups. The Japanese completed only one other carrier capable of operating the B7A, the &quot;Shinano&quot;, which was sunk by &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine &quot;Archerfish&quot; in November 1944, just ten days after being commissioned.

<doc id="514300" wikidata="Q365941" url="?curid=514300" title="Theophilus I of Alexandria">
<text>Theophilus (Greek: Θεόφιλος) was the 23rd Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the Seat of Saint Mark. He became pope at a time of conflict between the newly dominant Christians and the pagan establishment in Alexandria, each of which was supported by a segment of the Alexandrian populace.

==Background==
In 391, Theophilus (according to Rufinus and Sozomen) discovered a hidden pagan temple. He and his followers mockingly displayed the pagan artifacts to the public which offended the pagans enough to provoke an attack on the Christians. The Christian faction counter-attacked, forcing the pagans to retreat to the Serapeum. A letter was sent by the emperor that Theophilus should grant the offending pagans pardon, but destroy the temple; according to Socrates Scholasticus, a contemporary of his, the latter aspect (the destruction of the temple) was added as a result of heavy solicitation for it by Theophilus.

Scholasticus goes on to state that:

The destruction of the Serapeum was seen by many ancient and modern authors as representative of the triumph of Christianity over other religions. According to John of Nikiu in the 7th century, when the philosopher Hypatia was lynched and flayed by an Alexandrian mob, they acclaimed Theophilus&#x27;s nephew and successor Cyril as &quot;the new Theophilus, for he had destroyed the last remains of idolatry in the city&quot;.

Theophilus turned on the followers of Origen after having supported them for a time. He switched his view of God from the incorporeal view of God held by Origen to the anthropomorphic view held by many local monks who were hostile to his pastoral letter of 399.

He was accompanied by his nephew Cyril to Constantinople in 403 and there presided at the &quot;Synod of the Oak&quot; that deposed John Chrysostom.

On 10 July in the Eastern (Greek) Orthodox Synaxarion, there is a commemoration for the 10,000 monks slain on the orders of Pope Theophilus in his paranoid campaign against perceived Origenism and the Four Tall Brethren. His nephew and dynastic successor Cyril was canonized in both Eastern and Western Christendom, with the notable exception of the Assyrian Church of the East, for his articulation and defense of the hypostatic union, his central role at the First Council of Ephesus, and his opposition to Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople.

==Surviving works==
* Correspondence with Jerome, Pope Anastasius I and Pope Innocent I
* Vision of Theophilus
* Tract against Chrysostom
* Homily on the Crucifixion and the Good Thief
* Homilies translated by Jerome (preserved in Migne)
* Other homilies survive only in Coptic and Ge&#x27;ez translations.

==Theophilus’ Paschal table==
Theophilus obliged the pious Christian emperor Theodosius I (AD 379–395) to himself by dedicating his Paschal table to him (around AD 390). Theophilus’ Paschal table did not survive, but what we do know is that the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle underlying it must have been very different from the very first similar lunar cycle which somewhere in the third quarter of the third century was invented by Anatolius but differed very little from the classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle, which in the fifth century would be introduced by Annianus and adopted by Theophilus’ successor Cyrillus and whose Julian equivalent would become the Metonic basic structure of Dionysius Exiguus’ Paschal table. Bede&#x27;s Paschal table is an exact extension of Dionysius Exiguus&#x27; one.

==In popular culture==
Theophilus appears in the novel &quot;Flow Down Like Silver, Hypatia of Alexandria&quot; by Ki Longfellow.

He appears as a character played by Manuel Cauchi in the 2009 film &quot;Agora&quot;, directed by Alejandro Amenábar.

==Legacy==
The lunar crater Theophilus was named after him, as part of a group of three lunar craters named after prominent Alexandrian Christians.

Pope Theophilus is venerated as a saint within the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Coptic Church of Alexandria; his sainthood is not recognized by the Roman Catholic, or Assyrian Churches.

<text>Paul Joseph Weitz (July 25, 1932 – October 22, 2017) was an American naval officer and aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut, who flew into space twice. He was a member of the three-man crew who flew on Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission. He was also commander of the STS-6 mission, the maiden flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;.

==Biography==
Paul J. Weitz was born in 1932 in Erie, Pennsylvania, United States. He went on to complete a master&#x27;s degree in engineering and was a pilot in the Navy. He went on to be an astronaut who went in to space aboard Skylab and the Space Shuttle, later serving as a NASA official.

===Early years and education===
Weitz was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, on July 25, 1932. After attending McKinley Elementary School, he graduated from Harbor Creek High School in Harborcreek, Pennsylvania, in 1949 as Valedictorian. The high school stadium was later named after him. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 1954. While attending Penn State, he was a member of the Alpha Upsilon chapter of Beta Theta Pi. Ten years later, he received a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

===Flight experience===
Weitz received his commission as an Ensign through the Naval ROTC program at Penn State. He served for one year at sea aboard a destroyer before going to flight training and was awarded his aviator wings in September 1956. He served in various naval aircraft squadrons until he was selected as an astronaut in 1966. He logged more than 7,700 hours flying time—6,400 hours in jet aircraft.

===NASA career===
In April 1966, Weitz was one of 19 men selected by NASA for Astronaut Group 5. He served as pilot on the crew of Skylab 2 (SL-2), which launched on May 25 and splashed down on June 22, 1973. SL-2 was the first crewed Skylab mission. The mission lasted for 28 days, a record at the time. Weitz and his two crewmates, Pete Conrad and Joseph P. Kerwin, performed extensive and unprecedented repairs to serious damage that Skylab sustained during its uncrewed launch, salvaging the entire Skylab mission. Weitz logged two hours and 11 minutes of EVA during the mission. If NASA followed typical crew rotations, Weitz may have been assigned as Command Module Pilot for the canceled Apollo 20 mission.

In 1976 Weitz retired from NASA and went back to the Navy, but he returned to NASA to fly the maiden spaceflight of the &quot;Challenger&quot; at over 50 years old.
Weitz was spacecraft commander on the crew of STS-6, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 4, 1983. This was the maiden voyage of the orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot;. During the mission, the crew conducted numerous experiments in materials processing, recorded lightning activities, deployed IUS/TDRS-A, conducted extravehicular activity while testing a variety of support systems and equipment in preparation for future spacewalks, and also carried three Getaway Specials. Mission duration was 120 hours before &quot;Challenger&quot; landed on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 9, 1983. With the completion of this flight, Weitz logged a total of 793 hours in space.

Weitz was Deputy Director of the Johnson Space Center when he retired from NASA in May 1994.

===Personal life and death===
Weitz married the former Suzanne M. Berry of Harborcreek, Pennsylvania. They had two children.

Hunting and fishing were among his hobbies.

After retiring, Weitz lived in Arizona until his death on October 22, 2017, from myelodysplastic syndrome at the age of 85.

<text>Betty Ann Ong (, Taishanese Ang4 ngut4 mi3; February 5, 1956 – September 11, 2001) was an American flight attendant who worked for American Airlines and boarded Flight 11, the first airplane hijacked during the September 11 attacks. Ong was the first person to alert authorities to the hijackings taking place that day. Shortly after the hijacking, Ong notified the American Airlines ground crew of the hijacking, staying on the radiophone for 23 minutes to relay vital information that led to the closing of airspace by the FAA, a first in United States history. For this, the 9/11 Commission declared Ong a hero.

==Life and career==
Betty Ann Ong was born on February 5, 1956, in San Francisco. She was of Kaiping descent, a branch of Sze Yup Cantonese, and had two sisters, one of whom was named Cathie, and a brother named Harry. Among her hobbies as an adult was collecting Beanie Babies.

Betty was once approached for work in modeling, but her mother disapproved of that career choice, so instead Ong would work at her parents&#x27; beef jerky factory. According to an account related by her sister Cathie Ong-Herrera in &quot;New York Post&quot;, an armed robbery at the factory illustrated Ong&#x27;s steady nerves in a crisis situation. As Cathie described it, &quot;Betty was out in front and had a gun held to her head. My mom said she never panicked. All she said was, &#x27;Dad, we’re being robbed.&#x27;&quot; The robbers were given the money they demanded and Cathie said of her sister, &quot;She was never shook up.&quot;

In the beginning of the 1980s, she joined Pacific Southwest Airlines and worked within the airline&#x27;s baggage claim department. Afterwards, she worked as a ticket agent with Delta Air Lines. In 1987, she became a flight attendant with American Airlines.

In 1987, Betty was driving south on U.S. Highway 101 in San Francisco when she witnessed a car roll over twice after it was hit by a speeding pickup truck. Betty ran to the car and saw that its occupant was Jo Ellen Chew, a woman she met a month prior at a bowling alley, who later described the &quot;courage, kindness, [and] compassion&quot; exhibited by Ong, saying, &quot;Most people would just pass by. But to stop and run up to me? A miracle!&quot;

Ong was engaged to Robert Landrum. At the time of her death, Ong lived in Andover, Massachusetts.

==Death==
On September 11, 2001, Ong assigned herself to Flight 11, so she could return to Los Angeles and go on vacation to Hawaii with her sister. During the hijacking, she used a telephone card to call American Airlines&#x27; operations/Raleigh reservations center, from the plane&#x27;s rear galley; identified herself and alerted the supervisor that the aircraft had been hijacked. Along with fellow flight attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney, she relayed a report of the seat numbers of three hijackers. During her Airfone call, she reported that none of the crew could contact the cockpit or open its door; that passenger Daniel Lewin, and two flight attendants, Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui, had been stabbed; and that she thought someone had sprayed Mace in the business class cabin. 

===Phone call===
Transcript of the last 8-minute 26-second conversation between Ong, American Airlines&#x27; operations/Raleigh reservations, Nydia Gonzalez (Operations Specialist on duty on September 11) and American Airlines&#x27; emergency line, beginning with Ong in mid-sentence, her voice audible only during its first four minutes:
==Memorials and legacy==

On September 21, 2001, some 200 members of the Chinese American community in San Francisco gathered in a small park to pay tribute to Ong. Mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown, who was present, gave a proclamation honoring the people who died in the tragedy and called September 21 &quot;Betty Ong Day&quot;.

In 2002, Ong, Sweeney and Flight 11 Captain John Ogonowski were the inaugural recipients of the Madeline Amy Sweeney Award for Civilian Bravery, an honor that the Government of Massachusetts instituted to award annually at least one Massachusetts resident for displaying extraordinary courage in defending or saving the lives of others.

In March 2002, Ong&#x27;s remains were recovered from Ground Zero and identified. She was cremated and her ashes were buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

In 2011, the recreation center in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown where she had played as a child was renamed in her honor, as the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center.

Ong&#x27;s name is located on Panel N-74 of the National September 11 Memorial&#x27;s North Pool, along with those of other occupants of Flight 11.

Ong is memorialized on &quot;Gold Mountain&quot;, a mural dedicated to Chinese contributions to American history on Romolo Place in North Beach, a street where she used to skateboard and play as a child.

===Betty Ann Ong Foundation===
The Betty Ann Ong Foundation was founded to honor Ong&#x27;s interest in the welfare of children, by providing, in the words of board member David Huff, &quot;training and guidance on nutrition, health, physical activities, leadership skills, critical thinking skills, planning, group and team activities, and community awareness and cohesiveness&quot;. Among its activities are contributions to groups including the Bakersfield Police Activities League and Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. 

In March 2013, the foundation publicly opposed the decision of the Transportation Security Administration to allow knives with blades up to 2.36 inches long back onto aircraft for the first time since the 9/11 attacks. Ong&#x27;s sister, Cathie Ong-Herrera, speaking as the president and CEO of the foundation, stated, &quot;The horrific events that took place on the morning of September 11, 2001 began with the takeover of American Airlines Flight 11. Terrorists took control of the aircraft by first fatally stabbing two flight attendants with box-cutters. My sister, flight attendant Betty Ann Ong, along with the entire flight crew and passengers were murdered. There are no words to describe the gut-wrenching pain and grief our family has experienced—things that no other family should ever have to endure. I support the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions&#x27; position to reverse the TSA&#x27;s decision to allow knives and other dangerous objects on aircraft because it&#x27;s about everyone&#x27;s safety.&quot; The foundation was among a coalition of groups opposed to the move by the TSA, which abandoned the plan as a result.

==In media==
Ong was played by Jean Yoon in the 2006 ABC miniseries &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;, and by Jane Zhang in episode two of the 2004 BBC docudrama &quot;Zero Hour.&quot;

An extensive clip from Ong&#x27;s call to headquarters was used for the beginning of the 2012 film &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;. The clip was used without attribution, and without the consent of Ong&#x27;s family and the airline. They requested that Sony Pictures Entertainment, the film&#x27;s U.S. distributor, make a charitable donation in her name, credit her onscreen, state the Ong family does not endorse torture (which the film depicts being used in the manhunt for Osama bin Laden) on its website and in home entertainment versions of the film, and acknowledge these things during the 85th Academy Awards ceremony.
