<text>Mohammad Najib bin Abdul Razak (, ; born 23 July 1953) is a Malaysian politician who served as the sixth Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2009 to 2018. In 2020, he was convicted of corruption in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, one of the largest money-laundering and embezzlement scandals in history. He is the son of former prime minister Abdul Razak Hussein. Najib served as the chairman of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition from April 2009 to May 2018 and as the president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) from November 2008 to May 2018. However, the coalition experienced an unprecedented defeat in the 2018 general election, attributed to corruption charges involving Najib and his family, which eroded public trust in the ruling party. The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax, widely regarded as unpopular, also significantly contributed to the decline in support.

Najib was elected to the Parliament of Malaysia in 1976, at the age of 23, replacing his deceased father in the Pahang-based seat of Pekan. In the same year, he was appointed the head of UMNO Youth&#x27;s Pekan branch and became a member of the youth wing&#x27;s Executive Council. In the early years of his political career, Najib took on a deputy minister role in 1976, and between 1982 and 1986, he was the Menteri Besar of Pahang. Thereafter, until 2009, he was rotated throughout the Cabinet of Malaysia, taking on various ministerial portfolios in defence, education, culture, youth and sports, and finally finance. Between 1993 and 2009, Najib was a vice-president of UMNO. During his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister, he was accused of being involved in the 2006 Altantuya Shaariibuu murder case, but he denied any involvement in the case.

Najib&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, between 2009 and 2018, was marked by economic liberalisation measures, such as cuts to government subsidies, which were unpopular among the public. After the 2013 election, his government pursued a number of its critics on sedition charges, the imprisonment of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim following a conviction for sodomy and the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST). He was Prime Minister during the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disaster and a dispute with North Korea following the assassination of Kim Jong-nam. In 2015, Najib became implicated in a major corruption scandal involving state investment firm 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) which led to rallies calling for his resignation, spearheaded by the grassroots movement Bersih. These protests culminated in the Malaysian Citizens&#x27; Declaration by Mahathir Mohamad, Pakatan Harapan and NGOs which sought to oust Najib.

Najib&#x27;s response to the corruption accusations was to tighten his grip on power by replacing then-deputy prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin, suspending two newspapers and pushing through parliament a controversial National Security Council Bill that provides the prime minister with unprecedented powers. Najib&#x27;s various subsidy cuts have contributed to soaring living costs, while fluctuating oil prices and the fallout from the 1MDB scandal led to a depreciation of the Malaysian currency. These ended with BN&#x27;s loss in the 2018 general elections. Najib then conceded defeat and promised to help facilitate a smooth transition of power.

On 3 July 2018, Najib was arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), which investigated how RM42 million (US$10.6 million) went from SRC International, a company related to 1MDB, into Najib&#x27;s bank account. In the process, the police seized a number of fashion accessories worth $273 million while searching through his properties. Najib was subsequently charged and convicted by the High Court on abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust, becoming the first Prime Minister of Malaysia to be convicted of corruption, and was sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment and fined RM210 million. At the same time, Najib was also simultaneously directed to settle RM1.69 billion in tax arrears owed to the Inland Revenue Board (IRB). The sentence was upheld by the Federal Court on 23 August 2022. He is currently serving his sentence in Kajang Prison. Najib&#x27;s political career has been marred by numerous controversies and allegations of corruption.

==Early life and education==
Najib was born on 23 July 1953 at the Pahang State Secretary official residence in Bukit Bius, Kuala Lipis, Pahang. Najib is the eldest of second Malaysian Prime Minister Abdul Razak&#x27;s six sons. His younger brother, Dato&#x27; Seri Mohd Nazir Abdul Razak, runs the country&#x27;s second-largest lender, Bumiputra-Commerce Holdings Bhd. Najib is also one of the Four Noblemen of the Pahang Darul Makmur (Royal Court) by virtue of his inherited title as the Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. He received his primary and secondary education at St. John&#x27;s Institution, Kuala Lumpur. He later attended Malvern College in Worcestershire, England, and subsequently went to the University of Nottingham, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial economics in 1974. Najib Razak returned to Malaysia in 1974 and entered the business world, serving briefly at Bank Negara Malaysia and later with Petronas (Malaysia&#x27;s national oil company) as a public affairs manager.

==Early political career==
The eldest son of Malaysian Prime Minister, Abdul Razak Hussein, was elected to the Parliament of Malaysia in 1976 replacing his deceased father in the Pahang-based seat of Pekan. The national outpouring of grief following Tun Razak&#x27;s death and the respect for his father helped Najib win election unopposed as Member of Parliament at the very young age of 23. In 1986 Najib won re-election to the same seat.

From 1982 to 1986 he was the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Pahang, before holding various cabinet posts throughout the remainder of the 1980s and 1990s, including Defence and Education. In 2004 he became Deputy Prime Minister under Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, and replaced him 2009. Under his leadership, Barisan Nasional won the 2013 elections, although for the first time in Malaysia&#x27;s history the opposition won the majority of the popular vote.

Najib was first assigned into the Cabinet of Malaysia at the age of 25 when he was appointed Deputy Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Post in 1978, becoming the youngest deputy minister in the country. He served as the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Pahang between 1982 and 1986, becoming the youngest Menteri Besar in the state to enter office when he was sworn in at the age of 29. In 1986 he was appointed as Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports in the Cabinet of Mahathir Mohamad. He focused on improving Malaysian sports and introduced the National Sports Policy in 1988. In 1989 Malaysia achieved its best-ever performance at the South East Asia (SEA) Games, held in Kuala Lumpur.

Najib was appointed head of UMNO Youth&#x27;s Pekan branch and became a member of UMNO Youth&#x27;s Executive Council (Exco) in 1976. In 1981, he was selected as a member of UMNO&#x27;s Supreme Council, before winning the post of Vice-President of UMNO Youth in 1982.

On 26 October 1987, the then leader of the opposition, Lim Kit Siang, called for the Anti-Corruption Agency to investigate how Najib, who was then Pahang MB, could give approval for a logging concession of 2000 acres to a resident of a low-cost housing estate. He asked ACA to investigate whether the logging concessionnaire was in fact a nominee for Najib himself.

In 1987, Najib was selected as the acting head of the Movement of UMNO Youth by Dato&#x27; Seri Anwar Ibrahim after Anwar was asked to contest the post of UMNO Vice-President. Following mounting ethnic tensions anti-Chinese sentiments were expressed at a UMNO Youth rally held in Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur the same year where Najib spoke. Rising tensions soon lead to fears of ethnic violence and eventually resulted in a security operation known as Operasi Lalang, that included numerous administrative detentions.

Following the complete reorganisation and founding of the &quot;New&quot; UMNO by Mahathir Mohamad in the aftermath of the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis, Najib was appointed president of UMNO Youth in 1988.

By 1993, Najib was elected as one of six vice-presidents of UMNO in response to Anwar&#x27;s decision to contest as the deputy president of UMNO. Najib continued to defend his post in party elections held in 1993, 1996, and 2004.

==Senior Ministerial career==
===Minister for Defence (1991–1995)===
In 1991, Mahathir appointed Najib as Minister of Defence. Under Najib&#x27;s direction, Malaysian troops were deployed to assist the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia in 1993 during the Bosnian War. Malaysian forces were greeted warmly by Bosnians as well as Serbs and Croats. Malaysia also assisted peacekeeping operations in Somalia in 1993, losing one soldier in an effort to aid US soldiers during the Battle of Mogadishu. Najib later criticised the UN&#x27;s Somalia operation as putting too much emphasis on military action. Since then Malaysia has stated a preference for participating in Chapter 6 &quot;peace enforcement&quot; missions, rather than Chapter 7 &quot;peacekeeping&quot; missions. After four years at the Ministry of Defence, Najib assumed control of the Education Ministry in 1995. He returned to the Ministry of Defence in 2000.

Japanese raped Malay comfort women but UMNO leader Najib Razak blocked all attempts by other UMNO members like Mustapha Yakub at asking Japan for compensation and apologies.

===Minister for Education (1995–2000)===
In 1995, Najib left the Defence Ministry for the first time when he was appointed Minister of Education. His challenge was to respond to Malaysia&#x27;s newly proclaimed aspiration to become a fully developed nation by 2020. The 1996 Private Higher Education Institutions Act, allowed foreign universities to establish degree-conferring schools in Malaysia, providing greater educational opportunities for Malaysians and positioning Malaysia as a regional learning hub.

During the 1999 general elections Najib suffered a major setback when he barely won re-election to the Parliament by a margin of 241 votes, compared to a margin of over 10,000 in the previous election. This is a surprise to political observers.

===Return as Minister for Defence (2000–2008)===
During his second tenure as Minister of Defence Najib coordinated Malaysia&#x27;s relief efforts following the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, and provided support to Indonesia in arresting those responsible for the 2005 Bali bombings. Najib also oversaw the deployment of Malaysian troops as a part of a UN peacekeeping force in 2006, when Malaysia volunteered to help stabilise Lebanon following the 2006 Lebanon War.

As Defence Minister, Najib instituted compulsory military service in December 2003, stating that it would encourage interaction and friendship between youth of different ethnic groups and religions. During its first five years of operation, over 339,000 Malaysian youth participated in the PLKN (the Bahasa Malaysian acronym for &quot;Malaysian National Service&quot;), which is intended to promote tolerance, teamwork, and community engagement. The programme, however, has faced challenges. Safety issues in the program have been reported and several people died during or shortly after their terms of service during the program&#x27;s first few years. In response, Najib strengthened the PLKN&#x27;s health screening requirements and reinforced the government&#x27;s commitment to punish negligent PLKN officials.

==== The Altantuyaa affair ====

French courts investigated allegations of corruption in the purchases of two submarines, by the Malaysian Ministry of Defence in 2002, at a time when Najib was the minister of defence. The allegations are that Abdul Razak Baginda, an aide of Najib, received &quot;commission&quot; payments from the French submarine builder DCNS. Shaariibuugiin Altantuyaa, a Mongolian woman hired as a French translator to facilitate the purchase of the submarines and mistress to Baginda, tried to blackmail Baginda for a $500,000 cut and was subsequently murdered. 2 policemen, who were bodyguards posted to Najib, were charged and found guilty. Reviewing the Altantuyaa case, Tommy Thomas, Attorney General of Malaysia from 2018 to 2020, wrote that the evidence &quot;implicated not only Najib Razak as the person who gave [one of the bodyguards] the order to kill, but also his aide-de-camp, Musa Safri&quot;.

===Deputy Prime Minister (2004–2009)===
In 2004, Mahathir retired and was replaced by his deputy, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Najib became Deputy Prime Minister and was given a broad portfolio of responsibilities, including oversight of FELDA, the Human Rights Commission (SUHAKAM), and the Election Commission (EC). Najib also chaired more than 28 cabinet committees. He remained as Minister for Defence.

In September 2008, Najib became the Minister for Finance, handing the Defence portfolio to Badawi. During the global financial crisis, Malaysia faced a strong recession and reduced levels of trade throughout the South Asian region. In response, Najib announced a series of stimulus packages to be implemented over a two-year period with the intention of acting as a countercyclical response that might otherwise protect Malaysia&#x27;s economy. He also pressed for the country to move beyond existing manufacturing capabilities through education, research and development to develop greater strength as a provider of sophisticated business services.

===Becoming Prime Minister===
After a poor showing by the ruling UMNO coalition in the elections of 8 March 2008 in which opposition parties gained control of five of thirteen Malaysian state governments, Badawi identified Najib as his intended successor. On 8 October 2008, Prime Minister Badawi announced he would step down in March 2009, paving the way for Najib to succeed him. However he said the onus was on Najib to win party elections set for March before he could take over. Najib ran for the presidency of UMNO and went on to win on 2 November 2008, without contest.

On 26 March 2009, Najib won the UMNO presidency unopposed. He was sworn in as Prime Minister of Malaysia on 3 April 2009 In 2012, Najib also assumed the role of women, family and community development minister, a position he held until the 2013 election.

==Prime Minister (2009–2018)==

During his tenure as Prime Minister, Najib implemented various economic and infrastructure development programs, including the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) initiative. However, his leadership was marred by allegations of corruption and misappropriation of funds related to the 1MDB scandal, which led to his political downfall. In this scandal, it was alleged that billions of dollars were siphoned off from the 1MDB state investment fund, which Najib was closely associated with, into his personal accounts and those of his associates. These funds were purportedly used for various personal expenses, including luxury real estate, artwork, and even financing the production of Hollywood films.

Najib consistently denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the funds in his personal accounts were donations from a Saudi royal family member, which he said were used for political purposes and not for personal gain. However, investigations by various authorities in multiple countries, including the United States and Switzerland, uncovered evidence suggesting a different story.

In 2018, Najib&#x27;s political career faced a significant setback when his party, Barisan Nasional, lost the general elections to the Pakatan Harapan coalition. Subsequently, he faced legal charges related to the 1MDB scandal.

===Domestic policy===
====1Malaysia====
1Malaysia is an ongoing campaign announced by Najib on 16 September 2008, calling for the cabinet, government agencies, and civil servants to emphasise ethnic harmony, national unity, and efficient governance. The eight values of 1Malaysia as articulated by Najib are perseverance, a culture of excellence, acceptance, loyalty, education, humility, integrity, and meritocracy. While the concept aimed to promote national unity and inclusiveness, some critics argued that it was primarily a political slogan and that it did not lead to significant policy changes to address the underlying issues of ethnic and cultural diversity in the country.

On 17 September 2008, Najib launched &quot;1Malaysia.com.my&quot; in an effort to communicate with the citizens of Malaysia more efficiently and support the broader 1Malaysia campaign. He has used the site to highlight his policy initiatives and to provide a forum for Malaysians to their government. The 1Malaysia campaign makes extensive use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Research has suggested that Najib and UMNO have made extensive efforts to establish a favourable online presence through the recruitment and support of bloggers and other social media users, sometimes known as &#x27;cybertroopers.&#x27;

However, Najib has been criticised for an apparent deterioration of race relations in Malaysia during his tenure that has occurred despite the 1Malaysia programme. In 2014, the long-serving former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad withdrew his support for Najib citing, among other things, the abandonment by Chinese voters of the Barisan Nasional coalition. Najib&#x27;s tenure has also been marked by increasingly aggressive racial rhetoric from elements within Najib&#x27;s UMNO party, particularly towards Chinese Malaysians. Additionally, there were concerns that the government&#x27;s efforts to promote 1Malaysia were seen by some as a way to consolidate power and influence.

So, while the 1Malaysia concept was intended to promote unity and inclusiveness, it did face controversy and criticism from various quarters during Najib Razak&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister.

====BR1M Project====
The first BR1M Project was a scheme devised by Najib Razak to help poor Malaysians. The amount of RM 500.00 Ringgit Malaysia was given to households with an income of less than RM 3,000 a month.

The second BR1M Project, also known as BR1M 2.0, with more than 2.5 billion ringgit will be distributed to Malaysians nationwide. This will affect 5.7 million household all over the country. In addition to the RM 500.00 for household, the government has also allocated RM 250.00 to single individuals. Those who have received RM 500.00 from the first BR1M project need not apply as it will be automatically processed.

BR1M 4.0, which was announced in 2014, saw an increase in handouts from RM 650 to RM 950 for individuals earning less than RM 2,000.00, while households earning less than RM 4,000 will receive RM 750.

====Housing Programme====

Perumahan Rakyat 1Malaysia (PR1MA) Berhad was established under the PR1MA Act 2012 to plan, develop, construct and maintain affordable lifestyle housing for middle-income households in key urban centres. Middle-income is defined as a monthly household (husband and wife) income of between RM 2,500 and RM 7,500.

PR1MA will be the first organisation that exclusively targets this middle segment with homes ranging from RM 100,000 to RM 400,000 in a sustainable community.

====National Security Council Bill 2015====

In December 2015, the National Security Council Bill 2015 was passed in Parliament after a marathon six-hour debate. The bill provides the Prime Minister of Malaysia with unprecedented powers, such as the ability to define what constitutes a security issue as well as deem any part of Malaysia a security area. Within that area, authorities may make arrests, conduct searches or seize property without a warrant. The bill was criticised by rights groups as inviting government abuse. The Malaysian Bar called it a &quot;lurch towards an authoritarian government&quot;. The government has defended the bill, with cabinet minister Shahidan Kassim saying the law is necessary to enable better co-ordination and a uniform response in the event the country is faced with security threats, and that the law does not contravene the basic human rights guaranteed under the federal constitution.

===Economic policy===
====New Economic Model====

On 2 May 2009, Najib announced the government&#x27;s plan to develop a New Economic Model that will speed Malaysia&#x27;s transition to a high-income country. The plan will emphasise ways to increase the income and productivity of workers by encouraging knowledge industries and increasing investment from overseas.

====Reform of government subsidies====
Najib has started to implement comprehensive reform of government subsidies. On 16 July 2010, subsidies for petrol, diesel and LPG were cut as part of Malaysia&#x27;s general programme of reducing and rationalising subsidies per the 10th Malaysia Plan and the New Economic Model. The government believes it will save RM 750 million by the end of 2010 through these measures with little negative impact on most citizens. Sugar and fuel subsidies were selected for reform because they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and foreigners, encourage over-consumption and create opportunities for fraud and smuggling. Najib expressed his hope that Malaysians would adopt a healthier lifestyle. He said, &quot;there is no logic in the government allocating subsidies worth almost RM1 billion on a commodity that could endanger the people&#x27;s health&quot;. Responding to concerns about how these reforms might affect the poor, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office pointed out that Malaysia will still be spending RM 7.82 billion per year on fuel and sugar subsidies and that prices for these commodities would remain the lowest in Southeast Asia. The government also stated that education and health care would continue receiving state support.

====Economic liberalisation====
Malaysia has implemented substantial measures to attract foreign investment including a moderation of preferences designed to benefit ethnic Malays. Specifically these reforms include allowing foreign investors to hold majority stakes in most enterprises excluding &quot;strategic&quot; industries such as banking, telecommunications, and energy, easing insurance regulation, curtailing powers of the Foreign Investment Committee and lowering the minimum quota for Malay ownership in publicly traded companies from 30 percent to 12.5 percent. As he introduced the reforms Najib stated, &quot;The world is changing quickly and we must be ready to change with it or risk being left behind.&quot;

Since these reforms have been implemented, the American banking firms Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have been granted permission to expand their operations in Malaysia. Goldman Sachs received licenses to set up fund management and advisory operations. Citigroup has obtained a permit to offer brokerage services. The approval of these licenses is a sharp break from Malaysia&#x27;s history of domestically dominated and tightly regulated markets for financial services.

The International Institute for Management Development responded to these and other reforms by increasing Malaysia&#x27;s ranking to the 10th-most competitive economy in the world in 2010 from 18th in 2009. Malaysia, which is now ranked fifth in the Asia Pacific region, scored well in business and government efficiency. Economists attributed the rise of Malaysia&#x27;s ranking to the efforts of the Malaysian government to improve the country&#x27;s business environment such as the New Economic Model, the Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme.

====Stimulus packages====
The Malaysian government passed two stimulus packages to mitigate the effects of the global economic downturn. The first stimulus package, worth RM 7 billion, was announced on 4 November 2008. The second package, worth RM 60 billion, was announced on 10 March 2009. Since assuming office as Prime Minister, Najib has been monitoring the progress of the stimulus packages on a weekly basis. Government economists believe that the stimulus packages have successfully generated increased economic activity, especially in the construction sector. Malaysia&#x27;s central bank reported that Malaysia&#x27;s economy grew at an annualised rate of 9.5% during the first half of 2010. Najib says the country is on track to meet the 6% average annual growth to reach its goal of becoming a developed country by 2020. Commenting on this same economic data Najib said that as of August 2010 there were no plans for further economic stimulus. Rather he said the government would focus on improving Malaysia&#x27;s economic fundamentals and increasing investment.

===Foreign policy===
====Palestine====

The government of Malaysia has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Malaysia also supports unity between the Palestinian Fatah and Hamas factions. Najib visited the West Bank with his wife Rosmah Mansor, escorted by senior officers of the Malaysian government. Najib became the first Muslim leader from South East Asia to set foot on Palestinian soil. Najib says Palestinians can count on Malaysia, but for there to be lasting peace, Hamas and Fatah must unite to safeguard the safety and security of the Palestinian people. Malaysia will give Palestine the moral, financial and political support it needs to rise above its struggles, but securing a future of lasting peace hinges on the Palestinians being united. Najib also stated that for Palestine to move towards having a future it envisioned, Palestinians would have to take the first step – to unite among themselves.

====United States====
Najib&#x27;s visit in September 2017 to the United States on the invitation of President Donald Trump successfully strengthened the Comprehensive Partnership that was established between Malaysia and the United States in 2014.

Najib enjoyed a close personal relationship with then US President Barack Obama and managed to upgrade Malaysia-US relations to a &#x27;comprehensive partnership&#x27;.

Najib and Obama met just before the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on 12 April 2010. This was their first one-on-one meeting. During their talk, Obama sought further assistance from Malaysia in stemming nuclear proliferation which Obama described as the greatest threat to world security. During the summit, Najib stressed that Malaysia only supported nuclear programmes designed for peaceful purposes. Najib&#x27;s attendance at the summit was part of a week-long official visit to the United States.

====India====

Najib travelled to India on a five-day state visit in January 2010. His 200-strong entourage included cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, state government officials, members of parliament, and prominent business leaders. During his visit, Najib pushed for a free-trade agreement and co-operation across a wide range of fields. Najib and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed an extradition treaty and agreements to co-operate in the areas of higher education and finance. The two countries agreed to sign a free-trade agreement before the end of 2010 and Najib called for signing a &quot;Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement&quot; by the same date. These economic agreements have resulted in plans for RM 1.6 trillion in investment for Malaysia. In January 2010, Najib announced plans to develop a new visa regime for Indian nationals, specifically for managers and knowledge workers to visit Malaysia.

====New Zealand====

Under Najib&#x27;s government, Malaysia signed a free-trade agreement (FTA) with New Zealand on 26 October 2009 to take effect 1 August 2010. The agreement will reduce or eliminate tariffs on thousands of industrial and agricultural products. The two countries have also agreed to reciprocate most-favoured nation status in private education, engineering services, environmental protection, mining services and information technology.

====Myanmar====
In a protest rally in December 2016, Najib criticized the Myanmar authorities for the military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, and described the ongoing persecution as &quot;genocide&quot;.

=== LCS scandal ===
Najib has been implicated in the misappropriation of funds in the purchase of littoral combat ships (LCS). There is a perception that Najib was &quot;the most powerful decision-maker&quot; in the LCS procurement arrangements as he was both prime minister and finance minister at the time (April 2009). In 2022, Najib commented that the project was given to contractor Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd because it was owned by the Armed Forces Fund Board (LTAT) and all profits of the project would thus go to the armed forces.

=== 14th Malaysian general election ===
Malaysia held its 14th general election in May 2018, where Barisan Nasional suffered a historic defeat, failing to win a majority for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. Observers attributed the loss to the unpopular Goods and Services Tax and the 1MDB corruption scandal.

As the results became clear, Najib appeared on the morning of 10 May to state that he accepted the people&#x27;s will, though he stopped short of conceding defeat. His comments were criticized by some analysts as &quot;unstatesmanlike&quot;.

On 12 May 2018, Najib resigned as President of UMNO and Chairman of BN, with UMNO vice-president Hishammuddin Hussein succeeding him.

== Post-premiership (2018–present) ==
Najib accepted the defeat and pledged to facilitate a smooth transfer of power. On 12 May 2018, three days after he lost the general elections, a flight manifest stated that Najib and his wife, Rosmah were taking a private jet to Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport in Jakarta. In response, the Immigration Department, upon the orders of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, imposed a travel ban barring their exit from the country. Amidst the country&#x27;s mood turning against him, Najib resigned as the leader of UMNO and Barisan Nasional on the same day.

The newly elected Pakatan Harapan government swiftly reopened investigations into the 1MDB scandal. Since 16 May 2018, the Malaysian police have searched six properties linked to Najib and Rosmah as part of the investigation into the 1MDB scandal. They have seized 284 boxes filled with designer handbags, 72 large luggage bags containing cash in multiple currencies, and other valuables. The Malaysian police commissioner confirmed that the police seized goods with an estimated value of between US$223 and US$273 million. The police described it as the biggest seizure in Malaysian history.

In January 2019, a 7-second video clip of Najib uttered &quot;Malu Apa Bossku&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s there to be ashamed of my boss&quot;) went viral on the internet. Najib later released a picture of him posed on a Yamaha Y150 motorcycle with the registration plate 8055KU (BOSSKU). The catchphrase and the picture went viral on social media, especially with Malay youths, and inspired videos, memes, t-shirts, caps, vehicle stickers and a music video. The phenomenon has contributed to Najib&#x27;s rise in popularity. Najib also claimed that his &quot;Bossku&quot; phenomenon has contributed to a victory for his party in 2020 Kimanis by-election.

In December 2023, his lawyer Mohamed Shafee Abdullah stated that Najib already requested to pursue Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) while serving his jail sentence in the prison.

=== COVID-19 measure violations ===
On 6 May 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, Najib was given two fines amounting to RM3,000 for failing to comply with standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the conditional movement control order (CMCO) at a chicken rice restaurant. On 11 January 2022, the police opened an investigation into an event attended by Najib over claims that there was a breach of COVID-19 SOPs.

On 27 February 2022, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said he will review a video depicting Najib purportedly violating COVID-19 SOPs during a campaign visit in Perling, Johor. On 10 March 2022, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin revealed that his ministry had issued 42 compound notices for the violation of SOPs during the campaign period for the Johor election, including five to Najib.

==Controversies and issues==
===Murder of Altantuya Shaariibuu===

Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu disappeared outside the house of Abdul Razak Baginda, formerly a close associate of Najib, on October 19, 2006. She was never seen alive again. Three weeks later, her remains were found in a forest in Selangor. In 2008, Abdul Razak was acquitted by the High Court of abetment in the murder of Altantuyaa. In 2015, Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar were found guilty of her murder and sentenced to death. 
In 2007, a Mongolian witness caused a stir in court when she revealed that Altantuya had been photographed having a meal with a Malaysian government official named &#x27;Najib&#x27;. Detective P. Balasubramaniam also linked Najib to Altantuya in a statutory declaration (SD) on July 3, 2008. Najib has repeatedly denied knowing Altantuya or that he had any part in her death. Reviewing the Altantuyaa case, Tommy Thomas, Attorney General of Malaysia from 2018 to 2020, wrote that the evidence &quot;implicated not only Najib Razak as the person who gave [one of the bodyguards] the order to kill, but also his aide-de-camp, Musa Safri&quot;.

=== 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal ===

On 2 July 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ran an exposé alleging that MYR 2.672 billion (US$700 million) had been channelled from 1MDB into Najib&#x27;s personal bank accounts, triggering widespread calls for his resignation. Najib denied any wrongdoing and announced plans to sue the newspaper for libel but eventually failed to do so. On 6 July 2015, amid the 1MDB scandal, the ringgit fell to 3.8050 against the US dollar, the first time it slid beyond the 3.80 currency peg, which was lifted in 2005. To back up the allegations, on 7 July 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; released a batch of partially redacted documents that purportedly show how nearly US$700 million (RM2.6 billion) was moved from 1MDB into Najib&#x27;s personal bank accounts. These documents relate to transactions in March 2013, December 2014 and February 2015.

The multi-agency task force investigating these allegations reported on 10 July 2015 that Najib&#x27;s bank accounts at AmBank Islamic were closed before &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported the transfers of billions of ringgit to those accounts, thereby confirming that Najib had two accounts at that bank. The task force also confirmed that the six accounts it had just frozen did not belong to Najib but did not name the holders of those accounts Najib&#x27;s handling of the corruption scandal was criticised by, among others, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and then Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. During Najib&#x27;s mid-term Cabinet reshuffle on 28 July 2015, Najib dropped Muhyiddin from his position as Deputy Prime Minister, as well as other Ministers who had been critical of his leadership. Najib stated that the reason for this was to create a more &quot;unified team&quot;.

On 1 August 2015, Najib addressed UMNO delegates in Seremban and in a clear reference to the Sarawak Report, the London-based whistleblower site founded and operated by journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown, demanded that &quot;white people&quot; stay out of Malaysia&#x27;s affairs and stressed that he valued loyalty above all, and not smart people.

On 3 August 2015, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission stated that the RM 2.6 billion that had been banked into Najib&#x27;s personal account came from donors, not 1MDB, but did not elaborate on who the donors were or why the funds were transferred, nor why this explanation had taken so long to emerge since the allegations were first made on 2 July 2015. Umno Kuantan division chief Wan Adnan Wan Mamat later claimed that the RM 2.6 billion was from Saudi Arabia as thanks for fighting ISIS. He further claimed that the Muslim community in the Philippines as well as southern Thailand had also received similar donations, and that since the donations were made to Najib personally as opposed to UMNO, the funds were deposited into Najib&#x27;s personal accounts.

The scandal took a dramatic twist on 28 August 2015 when a member of Najib&#x27;s own party, Anina Saaduddin, UMNO&#x27;s Langkawi Wanita (women&#x27;s) representative, filed a civil suit against him alleging a breach of duties as trustee and that he defrauded party members by failing to disclose receipt of the donated funds, and account for their use. This suit was filed in the Kuala Lumpur High Court and also named party Executive Secretary Abdul Rauf Yusof. Expressing fear that Najib would wield influence to remove any member of UMNO &quot;for the sole purpose of avoiding liability&quot; the court was also petitioned for an injunction to restrain UMNO, its Supreme Council, state liaison body, divisions and branches from removing the nominal plaintiff as a party member pending the determination of the suit. The plaintiff also sought repayment amounting to US$650 million, the amount allegedly deposited by Najib to a Singapore bank, an account of all monies that he had received in the form of donations, details of all monies in the AmPrivate Banking Account No 2112022009694 allegedly belonging to Najib, along with damages, costs, and other reliefs.

On 21 September 2015, the New York Times reported that US investigators were investigating allegations of corruption involving Najib as well as people close to him. In particular, investigators focused on properties in the United States that were purchased in recent years by shell companies owned by Najib&#x27;s stepson Riza Aziz or connected to a close family friend, as well as a $681 million payment made to what is believed to be Najib&#x27;s personal bank account.

The claimed MYR 2.6 billion &quot;donation&quot; into Najib&#x27;s personal accounts led the opposition to table a no-confidence motion against Najib, on 18 October 2015.

On 26 January 2016, Malaysia&#x27;s Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali announced that the investigation into the $681 million payment into Najib&#x27;s personal bank account had been closed. The Anti-Corruption Commission investigating the gift, led by Apandi, concluded that no laws had been broken and that the gift did not amount to graft. Apandi was appointed attorney general by Najib in August 2015 after the previous attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, was abruptly dismissed by Najib. Although Bernama, Malaysia&#x27;s state-run news service, reported that Abdul Gani was removed for health reasons, many speculated that his dismissal was related to the 1MDB corruption investigation. The Attorney General then said that the [Saudi Royal Family] was the source of the $681 million gift, although doubts remained as the Saudi ministries of foreign affairs and finance had no information on the purported gift.

Najib was reported to have returned $620 million to the Saudi royal family in 2013, but no explanation was given as to the reason for the investment or what happened to the $61 million Najib did not return. Najib hailed the results of the investigation and reiterated his denial of any wrongdoing.

On 28 March 2016, the Australian television programme &quot;Four Corners&quot; in an episode called &quot;State of Fear: Murder and Money in Malaysia&quot;, aired new allegations about the large sums of money that have flowed into the bank accounts of Najib Razak.

On 30 March 2016, the Wall Street Journal, Time and several other news agencies reported that Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor had spent $15 million on luxury goods and extravagant travel expenses. During Najib Razak&#x27;s golf diplomacy with U.S. President Barack Obama on 24 December 2014, Malaysian investigation documents show that Rosmah Mansor had purchased items amounting to $130,625 at a Chanel store in Honolulu, Hawaii. The allegation was confirmed when a store employee at the Chanel store in the upscale Ala Moana Center recalled Najib&#x27;s wife shopping there just before 25 December 2014.

In April 2016, Mohd Nazifuddin Najib, the son of Najib, was named in the Panama Papers.

In July 2016, the United States Department of Justice launched a civil lawsuit to seize American assets worth over US$1 billion (4.1 billion MYR) allegedly obtained from US$3.5 billion (14.38 billion MYR) of misappropriated 1MDB funds. Within the civil lawsuit, a government official of high rank who had control over 1MDB was referred to as &quot;Malaysian Official 1&quot;, and mentioned over 30 times. &quot;Malaysian Official 1&quot; was alleged to have received around US$681 million (2.797 billion MYR) of stolen 1MDB money via Falcon Bank, Singapore on 21 and 25 March 2013, of which US$650 million (2.0 billion MYR) was sent back to Falcon Bank on 30 August 2013. In September 2016, Najib was identified as &quot;Malaysian Official 1&quot; by Abdul Rahman Dahlan, Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department and the Barisan Nasional strategic communications director. Dahlan also claimed that Najib was not named because he was &quot;not part of this investigation&quot;.

On 15 June 2017, The United States Department of Justice followed up on its July 2016 lawsuit by issuing a civil action in rem to forfeit assets involved in and traceable to an international conspiracy to launder money misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (&quot;a strategic investment and development company wholly-owned by the government of Malaysia&quot;). The writ provided detailed justifications for seeing to forfeit specific items and property located in the United States and abroad, including in the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
As a consequence of the 15 June 2017 writ, on 28 February 2018 Indonesian authorities seized the luxury yacht linked to the 1MDB investigations in waters off Bali, on behalf of the FBI. Additionally, on 7 March 2018 in Californian courts, the producers of the &#x27;Wolf of Wall Street&#x27; film agreed to pay $60m to settle Justice Department claims it financed the movie with money siphoned from 1MDB.

In a speech in December 2017, US attorney general Jeff Sessions said of the scandal: &quot;This is kleptocracy at its worst.&quot;

==== Subsequent arrest, legal proceedings and conviction ====
On 3 July 2018 after the 14th Malaysian general election, Najib was arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) as part of investigations into how RM42 million (US$10.6 million) went from SRC International into Najib&#x27;s bank account. The following day, Najib was indicted in the High Court in Kuala Lumpur on three counts of criminal breach of trust and one count of abuse of power in connection with SRC International funds totalling RM42 million. He was granted bail at RM1 million after pleading not guilty with his trial set for 18 February 2019.

On 8 August 2018, Najib was charged with three further counts of money laundering as part of the MACC&#x27;s investigation into the 1MDB scandal. Najib has denied making three transfers totaling RM42 from SRC International into his bank accounts.

On 10 September 2018, Najib posted a copy of the letter that purportedly came from Prince Saud Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia on his Facebook account, as a proof of the alleged financial donation of US$100mil (RM304.5mil) given to him in 2011. He said he decided to reveal the documents in a bid to clear his name of various accusations and slander, and would continue to do so on his social media accounts.

On 19 September 2018, Najib was arrested following two hours of questioning by the MACC, believed to be in relation to the RM2.6 billion donation he received in year 2013. Najib was charged on 20 September 2018 at the Sessions Court in Jalan Duta. However, he pleaded not guilty and was released on bail after his court appearance. On 21 September, he made a brief appearance at the Sessions Court registry to sign his bail at RM3.5 million for 25 counts of money laundering and abuse of power charges in relation to 1MDB. He has posted RM1 million for his bail, while the remaining RM2.5 million will be settled in instalments by the following week. In August 2019, during his second trial, Najib faces four charges of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of RM 2.3 billion between 2011 and 2014.

On 28 July 2020, the High Court convicted Najib guilty on all seven counts of abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust in relation to the SRC International case, becoming the first Prime Minister of Malaysia to be convicted of corruption.
High Court judge Mohamad Nazlan bin Mohamad Ghazali has delivered the verdict regarding the misappropriation of RM42 million (US$10 million) from SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB. In total, Najib faces 42 charges, of which 35 in another four trials are yet to be decided on.

On the day of his conviction, Najib was sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of RM210 million (for the first charge). He was also given six concurrent sentences of 10 years&#x27; imprisonment for the other six charges. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be serving another five years in prison. He would be appealing against the verdict of the High Court. The High Court granted a stay of execution of the conviction with an increased bail of RM 2 million with reporting to the police on the first and the fifth day of every month.

==== Appeal ====
Najib&#x27;s appeal hearing in front of the Court of Appeal of Malaysia began on 5 April 2021. On 8 December 2021, the Court of Appeal of Malaysia dismissed Najib&#x27;s appeal, therefore upholding both his conviction and 12-year sentence. Judge Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil has also condemned Najib&#x27;s actions as a &quot;national embarrassment&quot;. Najib&#x27;s lawyer stated that his client, who remained outside prison on bail, would further appeal to the Federal Court of Malaysia against his conviction and sentence. On 16 August 2022, Malaysia&#x27;s supreme court rejected Najib&#x27;s appeal for a retrial, stating that the case had no evidence of bias. The Federal Court indicated that it would hear a final appeal by Razak in the SRC corruption case from 18 August 2022.

On 23 August 2022, when the Federal Court was finishing hearing the appeal, Najib&#x27;s counsel made an application to recuse the Chief Justice Tengku Maimun. This application was dismissed and the Federal Court upheld the Court of Appeal&#x27;s conviction, handing down its full judgment here. Upon the dissolution of Parliament on 10 October 2022, Najib&#x27;s Pekan parliamentary seat was automatically vacated, and as he has been convicted of a crime, he is no longer eligible to stand in general elections.

Najib is the first Malaysian former prime minister to be convicted and jailed for corruption. Rumours that he would receive special treatment during his sentence were denied by officials.

On 2 February 2024, the Malaysian pardons board, headed by the outgoing Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdullah of Pahang announced that it had reduced Najib&#x27;s sentence to six years and reduced fines imposed on him to 50 million ringgit ($10.59 million). On 3 April, Najib submitted an application in court requesting that his jail sentenced be converted to house arrest, which was rejected on 3 July.

On 24 October 2024, Najib apologised for the damage caused by the 1MDB scandal but insisted that he had been misled over the matter, saying that &quot;Being held legally responsible for things that I did not initiate or knowingly enable is unfair to me&quot;.

On 27 November, the Kuala Lumpur High Court discharged a case of criminal breach of trust against Najib Razak over the 1MDB scandal, citing procedural delays. However, the court also allowed the filing of six addition cases against Najib and his treasury secretary Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah for misappropriating 6.6 billion ringgit ($1.5 billion) in public funds earmarked for 1MDB’s settlement payment to International Petroleum Investment Company of the United Arab Emirates.

Malaysia&#x27;s appeals court has granted jailed former prime minister Najib Razak the right to access a document he claims could allow him to serve his sentence at home, marking a rare legal victory in his ongoing legal battles related to the 1MDB scandal. A recent letter from the royal palace confirmed the existence of a royal order for house arrest, which has now been acknowledged publicly for the first time.

==Personal life==

In 1976, Najib married Tengku Puteri Zainah Tengku Eskandar (&#x27;Kui Yie&#x27;) with whom he has three children: Mohd Nizar Najib (born 1978), Mohd Nazifuddin Najib and Puteri Norlisa Najib.

In 1987, he divorced Kui Yie and married Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor with whom he has two children: Mohd Norashman Najib and Nooryana Najwa Najib. His daughter Nooryana is married to the nephew of former Kazakhstani President, Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Najib&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle garnered significant attention and controversy during his time in power. His wife Rosmah faced scrutiny for her expensive shopping habits, which allegedly included purchasing luxury handbags, jewelry, and clothing from top fashion brands. A large collection of designer handbags, some of which were worth millions of dollars, was seized from their properties during investigations. Najib was accused of using state funds for personal expenses, including covering credit card bills and luxury purchases. These allegations became a focal point of the 1MDB scandal.

Najib Razak is an avid golf lover and is known to have played golf with the two US Presidents – Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Trump referred to Najib as his &quot;favourite prime minister&quot;.

Najib Razak has four long-haired cats, named Kiki, Leo, Tiger and Simba.

<text>Balikpapan is a seaport city in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Located on the east coast of the island of Borneo, the city is the financial center of Kalimantan. Balikpapan is the city with the largest economy in Kalimantan with an estimated 2016 GDP at Rp 73.18 trillion. The city is served by Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Sepinggan Airport. Port of Semayang was the second busiest seaport in East Kalimantan, after that in Samarinda.

With a population of 688,318 according to the 2020 census, and an official estimate of 738,532 as at mid 2023 (comprising 277,458 males and 361,074 females), Balikpapan is the second most populous city in East Kalimantan, after Samarinda. Balikpapan has been consistently ranked as the most liveable city in Indonesia. However, in 2022, Balikpapan conceded this to Samarinda.

Balikpapan was originally a fishing village built by Buginese people in the 19th century. The first oil drilling began in Balikpapan on 10 February 1897, which was later set as the anniversary of the city. In 1899, the Dutch East Indies colonial administration granted a township status to Balikpapan. In 1907, &quot;Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij&quot; (BPM) made the city as its headquarters and imported skilled laborers, engineers, and managers from overseas. Subsequently, numerous multi-national companies came to Balikpapan to invest in the oil industry. This resulted in the economic boom of Balikpapan and attracted many migrants and expatriates.

During World War II, the Empire of Japan occupied the city in 1942, as part of the occupation of the Dutch East Indies, and it was bombed by the Allies in first Balikpapan Battle in 1942 and second battle in 1945. The battles impacted critical infrastructure, including the oil refinery stations and seaport which were completely burned to the ground. Upon Indonesia&#x27;s independence, BPM extended its activities in Balikpapan until 1965 when Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil company, took control over the ownership of BPM and its oil exploration activities.

==Etymology and nicknames==
There are several popular stories and legends explaining the origin of Balikpapan:

* The 10 pieces of board returned to Jenebora from the 1,000 pieces requested by the Sultan of Kutai as donations of building materials for the construction of the New Kutai Palace. The ten boards that were returned were referred to by the people of Kutai as Balikpapan Tu. So that the area along Balikpapan Bay, precisely in Jenebora is called Balikpapan.
* Tribe of Pasir Balik (native people of Balikpapan) is a descendant of grandfather and grandmother named Kayun Kuleng and Papan Ayun. So that the area along Balikpapan Bay by its descendants is called &quot;Kuleng-Papan&quot; or means Balikpapan (in Paser, &quot;Kuleng&quot; means &quot;Balik&quot;).
* In other legends it is also mentioned the origin of Balikpapan, namely from a daughter who was released by her father a king who did not want his daughter to fall into the hands of the enemy. The daughter who was still a toddler was tied up on several pieces of board in a state of lying. Because it was carried away and hit by waves, the board was reversed. When the board was stranded on the shore found by a fisherman and so it turned out that there was a daughter who was still bound. It is said that the princess was named Putri Petung who came from the Kingdom of Sand. So that the area where it was found was called Balikpapan.

The city has had several nicknames throughout its history such as the Oil City, City of Believers (&quot;Kota Beriman&quot;), which uniquely &quot;BERIMAN&quot; word is acronym from: &quot;BERsih&quot; (clean), &quot;Indah&quot; (magnificent), dan &quot;nyaMAN&quot; (comfortable).

==History==
Before the oil boom of the early 1900s, Balikpapan was an isolated Bugis fishing village. Balikpapan&#x27;s toponym (&quot;balik&quot; = &quot;behind&quot; and &quot;papan&quot; = &quot;plank&quot;) is from a folk story in which a local king threw his newborn daughter into the sea to protect her from his enemies. The baby was tied beneath some planks that were discovered by a fisherman. An alternative story is that, at the time of the Kutai sultanate, Sultan Muhammad Idris sent 1000 planks to aid the Paser Kingdom to build a new palace. The planks were shipped from Kutai to Paser along the Borneo shoreline by roping all the planks together. 10 out of the 1000 planks that were originally shipped resurfaced in a place currently called Balikpapan.

===Oil development===
On 10 February 1897, a small refinery company, Mathilda, began the first oil drilling. Building of roads, wharves, warehouses, offices, barracks, and bungalows started when the Dutch oil company Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij (BPM) arrived in the area.

===Second World War===
On 24 January 1942, a Japanese invasion convoy arrived at Balikpapan and was attacked by four United States Navy destroyers that sank three Japanese transports. The Japanese army landed and met with no opposition by the Dutch troops, which had been ordered to evacuate after destroying the oil installations. In response to this, the Japanese massacred 78 Dutch POWs and civilians.

Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) intelligence determined that half of all lubricating oils used by the Japanese military and 60 percent of all their aviation fuel came from refineries in Balikpapan, and it was therefore an extremely important target. The American 380th Bombardment Group under the command of the RAAF, including the famous B-24 Liberator &quot;Shady Lady&quot;, attacked the oil refineries in August 1943 from Darwin, Australia. Amazingly, there were no aircraft losses, despite the crash landing and subsequent repair of the &quot;Shady Lady&quot;.

In September and October 1944, the 5th and 13th Air Forces under the command of General George Kenney launched a series of five raids from Morotai and Noemfoor Islands. Kenney was a strong advocate for using the powerful B-29 Superfortress for this raid but was forced to use the B-24 Liberator instead. Unbeknownst to the Allied forces, the Japanese Air Force had conserved many of its dwindling numbers of fighters to protect the important oil refineries. The first two raids did not have fighter cover and suffered severe losses.

The 1945 Battle of Balikpapan concluded the Borneo campaign and Allied forces took control of Borneo island. Extensive wartime damage curtailed almost all oil production in the area until Royal Dutch Shell completed major repairs in 1950.

===CIA air raid===
In 1958, the CIA attacked Balikpapan and stopped oil exports. The US was running a CIA covert mission to undermine President Sukarno&#x27;s government by supporting right-wing rebels in Indonesia. The CIA, Taiwan and the Philippines had provided the Permesta rebels in North Sulawesi with an insurgent air force, the &quot;Angkatan Udara Revolusioner&quot; (AUREV). On 28 April 1958, a CIA pilot, William H. Beale, flying a B-26 Invader bomber aircraft that was painted black and showing no markings, dropped of four bombs on Balikpapan. The first damaged the runway at Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport, the second set the British oil tanker on fire and sank her and the third bounced off the British tanker without exploding. Beale&#x27;s fourth bomb set on fire and sank the Indonesian Navy KRI &quot;Hang Tuah&quot;, killing 18 crew and wounding 28. Before attacking &quot;Hang Tuah&quot;, Beale also machine-gunned the oil pipes to Shell&#x27;s wharf.

The CIA had orders to attack unarmed foreign merchant ships in order to drive foreign trade away from Indonesia and weaken its economy, with the intention of undermining Sukarno&#x27;s government. The day before attacking Balikpapan, Beale had also damaged a Shell complex at Ambon, Maluku. His Balikpapan raid succeeded in persuading Shell to suspend tanker services from Balikpapan and withdraw shore-based wives and families to Singapore. However, on 18 May Indonesian naval and air forces off Ambon Island shot down an AUREV B-26 and captured its CIA pilot, Allen Pope. The US immediately withdrew support for Permesta, whose rebellion rapidly diminished thereafter.

===Subsequent history===
Shell continued operating in the area until Indonesian state-owned Pertamina took it over in 1965. Lacking technology, skilled manpower, and capital to explore the petroleum region, Pertamina sublet petroleum concession contracts to multinational companies in the 1970s.

With the only oil refinery site in the region, Balikpapan emerged as a revitalized center of petroleum production. Pertamina opened its East Borneo headquarters in the city, followed by branch offices established by other international oil companies. Hundreds of laborers from Indonesia, along with skilled expatriates who served as managers and engineers, flocked into the city.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Topography of Balikpapan is generally hilly (85%), with only small areas of flat land (15%), mostly along the coast and surrounding the hilly areas. The hills are less than higher than the adjacent valleys. The altitude of Balikpapan ranges from 0 to above sea level. The city proper itself is located on eastern side of Bay of Balikpapan.

Most of the soil in Balikpapan contains yellow-reddish podsolic soil and alluvial and quartz sand, making it extremely prone to erosion.

===Climate===
Balikpapan features a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;) as there is no real dry season in Balikpapan. The city sees an average of of rain per year. Balikpapan generally shows little variation in weather throughout the course of the year. The city does not have significantly wetter and drier periods of the year and average temperatures are nearly identical throughout the course of the year, averaging about throughout the year.

==Ecology==
In Wain River Protection Forest, which is the main water catchment area and habitat for endangered species of Borneo, the community begins to encroach on how to burn it so that during the dry season some areas become barren and damage 40%. The area of Wain River forest reaches , slowly but surely continues to decrease, leaving with forest conditions that are still good at only 63 percents. Residents around looked for wood to cook in the forest even though the surrounding area had been lined with wire.

Previously between 2000 and 2001, illegal logging occurred in 10 to 15 points in the Wain River forest, and in 2009 this forest was hit by a fire along with the Manggar River forest which made of forest area engulfed in fire. The threat of coal mining from the surrounding area which provides mining permits such as Paser and Kutai Kartanegara also disrupts the border ecosystem of Wain River forest.

The urban forest in Telagasari, which was inaugurated in 1996 with an area of , has now shrunk to just around . The forest in the middle of this city has been surrounded by residential areas.

The protected forest of the Manggar River also suffered considerable damage, which is around 60%. The reservoirs in this forest are also threatened because coal mining fields and brick mills were set up so close that there was siltation of reservoir water. The majority of those who founded it were even known to be immigrant communities. In addition, the construction of the Samarinda-Balikpapan toll road planned by the East Kalimantan government which divides the forest for 8 kilometers across the reservoir could damage the quality of the clean water reserve in Balikpapan.

Forest damage resulted in Balikpapan being easily hit by floods and landslides when it was hit by heavy rains. Clean water supply is also decreasing because water absorption is narrowing, erosion is easily to occur and sediment from mining sites that flow into the river worsens and lowers reservoirs, coupled with Balikpapan conditions has few rivers and less fertile land.
The population of the Balikpapan&#x27;s mascot, the sun bear is fewer and only 50 are left. This is due to coal mining which narrows the habitat of sun bears, so its are reluctant to reproduce. In addition to sun bears, other Balikpapan animals that are declared endangered are proboscis monkeys, borneo gibbon, bornean orangutans, pangolin and otter civet. Whereas extinct animals in Balikpapan are Bornean Banteng (&quot;Bos javanicus lowi&quot;).

==Administrative divisions==

Balikpapan is bordered by Kutai Kartanegara Regency to the North, by the Makassar Strait to the South and East, and by Penajam North Paser Regency to the West. The city is divided into 6 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) subdivided into 34 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) tabulated below with their 2010 and 2020 Census populations, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.


Before 1987, Balikpapan Seberang was originally part of Balikpapan. However, due to enactment of the government regulation no. 21 on 13 October 1987, most of the district (excluding parts of Jenebora and Pantai Lango villages) was transferred into Paser Regency (Pasir) and later renamed into Penajam (Sepaku was split in 1996, the two districts are now part of Penajam North Paser Regency).

==Demographics==
During the Suharto dictatorship Balikpapan achieved unprecedented economic growth by attracting foreign investments, particularly in the exploitation of natural and mineral resources. The policy was heavily criticized for uncontrolled environmental damage and corrupt bureaucrats and politicians, but it significantly boosted urban development in resource-rich cities. In the 1970s Balikpapan experienced 7% population growth annually, while exports of timber and petroleum increased dramatically.

The indigenous tribe of Balikpapan is the Balik ethnic group which is a minority. Based on its origin, migrants come from neighbouring islands such as Java, Madura and Sulawesi. Residents mainly from ethnic migrants who have long settled in Balikpapan, namely from the ethnic Banjar, Bugis, Makassar, and Javanese. Other migrants including ethnic Minahasan, Madurese, and Sundanese. At the beginning of June 2014, the population reached 684,339 people with the number of arrivals during 2012 of 21,486 people, the highest number in the past three years. The number of migrants was able to exceed the number of newcomers who entered in Singapore in the same year which was as many as 20,693 inhabitants. The highest number of arrivals came from Java, which was 30%, then followed by Banjar and Bugis each by 20%, Toraja by 11%, Madura by 8%, Buton by 7% and Betawi by 4%.

===Indonesian Most Liveable City===
Based on Indonesian Most Liveable City Index which measured 27 indicators in every 2 years, Balikpapan is the best city for living in 2013 and toppled Yogyakarta as the best in 2011 and 2009. Balikpapan mainly maintained city management aspects and environment wellbeing. As part of the Earth Hour City Challenge, the city of Balikpapan, Indonesia was recognized as the Most Loveable City for 2015. In 2016, Balikpapan was nominated for the second time as the most lovable and sustainable city, pending final judgement. However, in 2022, Balikpapan no longer in the top 10, leaving Samarinda in top spot.

==Economy==

Some multinational corporations operate in East Borneo. Companies including Baker Hughes (US), ChevronTexaco (US), Halliburton (US), Pertamina (Indonesia), Schlumberger (France), Thiess (Australia), TotalEnergies (France) and Weatherford International (US) use Balikpapan as their base of operations in the region. Governmental public services including Bank Indonesia, the Finance Department, Angkasa Pura 1, the Port of Semayang, and several others also attract many people to work in this area.

Balikpapan has been chosen as the site of some important governmental agencies such as Komando Daerah Militer VI Tanjungpura and Kepolisian Daerah Kaltim.

Balikpapan oil refinery is on the shore of Balikpapan Bay and covers an area of . Founded in 1922, it is the oldest refinery in the area. The Allies destroyed it in the Second World War and Shell re-built it in 1950. The refinery has two subunits, Balikpapan I and Balikpapan II.

Balikpapan I has two raw oil refinery units that produce naphtha, kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, and residue and one high-vacuum unit that produces of paraffin oil distillate (POD), used as raw material for wax factories. The wax itself has various grades and is sold domestically and internationally.

Opened on 1 November 1983, Balikpapan II has a hydro-skimming and hydro-cracking refinery and produces petrol, LPG, naphtha, kerosene, and diesel fuel.

Indonesian government and their Pertamina planning as for 2017 expanding the oil refinery including the area of Persiba Balikpapan FC (old) stadium and Pertamina residents near the refinery. Balikpapan&#x27;s former mayor Rizal Effendi ask for primarily using Balikpapan peoples as worker that Pertamina needed up to 20.000 new employers.

<text>Giles Heneage Radice, Baron Radice, (4 October 1936 – 25 August 2022) was a British Labour Party politician and author. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1973 to 2001, representing part of County Durham, and then as a life peer in the House of Lords from 2001 until shortly before his death in 2022.

==Early life==
Radice was born in London on 4 October 1936, the son of a civil servant in the Indian Government, Lawrence Radice. His mother, Patricia, was the daughter of Conservative politician Arthur Heneage. Radice was educated at Winchester College and Magdalen College, Oxford. His national service was with the Coldstream Guards. He then worked as a research officer for the General and Municipal Workers&#x27; Union and was chair of the Young Fabians from 1967 to 1968.

==Parliamentary career==
Radice first stood for Parliament at Chippenham in 1964 and 1966, but came third each time. He was elected Labour Member of Parliament for Chester-le-Street from a 1973 by-election to 1983 and then North Durham until his retirement in 2001.

Radice served as Education spokesman in the Labour Shadow Cabinet under Neil Kinnock in the 1980s. As chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, Radice helped make the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England accountable to both Parliament and the people for its decisions over interest rates. He was a member of the House of Lords European Union Sub-Committee on external affairs until March 2015.

A europhile, Radice was one of only five Labour MPs to vote for the third reading of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, defying his party Whip, which was to abstain.

He was made a life peer as Baron Radice, of Chester-le-Street in the County of Durham, on 16 July 2001. He retired from the House of Lords on 1 August 2022.

==Writing and political ideas== 
As an advocate for Labour to ditch traditional dogmas, Radice has been described as a forerunner to Tony Blair. In his 1989 book &quot;Labour&#x27;s Path to Power: The New Revisionism&quot;, Radice set out his vision for a modernised Labour Party, which included abandoning Clause IV of the party constitution. His 1992 pamphlet &quot;Southern Discomfort&quot; also made a case for reform, arguing that Labour did not appear supportive of economic aspiration, and this was costing them support from working class voters in Southern England, particularly London.

Philip Stephens later wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, At that time, Giles Radice, then an MP, wrote a brilliant essay on what he called Labour&#x27;s &#x27;southern discomfort&#x27;. The party would not win, he argued, unless and until it managed to connect its ambitions for social justice with the individualistic aspirations of the voters in southern England. Here was the template for Mr Blair.

Radice returned to this theme following Labour&#x27;s 2010 defeat: his &quot;Southern Discomfort Again&quot; pamphlet (with Patrick Diamond) found that voters perceived that Labour had run out of steam, were out of touch (particularly on immigration), unfair and poorly led. In this pamphlet and in &quot;Southern Discomfort: One Year On&quot; (2011), Radice warned that the &#x27;southern problem&#x27; is more than geographical: social change means that Labour support collapsed in other areas, including the Midlands. A committed pro-European, Radice was a leading member both of the European Movement and Britain in Europe, and wrote a polemic called &quot;Offshore&quot; in 1992, in which he put the case for Britain in Europe.

After his retirement as an MP in 2001 Radice, wrote &quot;Friends and Rivals&quot;, an acclaimed triple biography of three modernisers from an earlier generation—Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, and Anthony Crosland—arguing that their failure to work more closely together had harmed the modernising cause. This was followed by &quot;The Tortoise and the Hares&quot;, a comparative biography of Clement Attlee, Ernest Bevin, Stafford Cripps, Hugh Dalton and Herbert Morrison. &quot;Trio: Inside the Blair, Brown, Mandelson Project&quot; was published in 2010. In a review of &quot;Trio&quot;, Andrew Blick wrote that, &quot;With his previous work &quot;Friends and Rivals&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Tortoise and the Hares&quot; (2008), Radice developed a distinctive approach to contemporary history, using group biography ...Radice adds to his historical approach not only a readable writing style, but the judgements of an experienced Labour politician.&quot;

==Other positions==
Lord Radice had been a member of the advisory board of the Centre for British Studies of Berlin&#x27;s Humboldt University since 1998. He was also a member of the Fabian Society. Radice was a chair of the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe (BACEE), and chair of the European Movement, from 1995 to 2001. He was also a chairman of Policy Network, the international progressive thinktank based in London.

==Personal life==
Radice married Penelope Angus in 1959; they had two daughters and divorced in 1969. In 1971, he married historian Lisanne Koch. He was a longtime resident of Camden, living in Gloucester Crescent in the 1960s before relocating to Parliament Hill.

Radice died from cancer on 25 August 2022, at age 85.

<text>The Île d&#x27;Orléans Bridge, known locally as the Pont de l&#x27;Île, is a suspension bridge that spans the Saint Lawrence River between the Beauport borough of Quebec City and Île d&#x27;Orléans (Orléans Island) in the Canadian province of Quebec. It is part of Quebec Route 368 and connects to Autoroute 40 on the north side.

The island was originally accessible only by ferry or by ice bridge during the winter. An electoral promise made by Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau to Montmorency County for a job-creation project during the Great Depression led to the construction of this bridge in 1934. It was completed in 1935 and initially named Taschereau Bridge.

The bridge, which uses under-deck trusses on the approaches to the main suspension-type span, is the farthest downstream of the Saint Lawrence River&#x27;s fixed crossings, but it does not cross the entire river.

<text>COASt, an acronym for &quot;cache on a stick&quot;, is a packaging standard for modules containing SRAM used as an L2 cache in a computer. COASt modules look like somewhat oversized SIMM modules. These modules were somewhat popular in the Apple and PC platforms during early to mid-1990s, but with newer computers cache is built into either the CPU or the motherboard. COASt modules decoupled the motherboard from its cache, allowing varying configurations to be created. A low-cost system could run with no cache, while a more expensive system could come equipped with 512 KB or more cache. Later COASt modules were equipped with pipelined-burst SRAM.

The standard was originally defined by Motorola to be between 4.33 and 4.36 inches (110 and 111 mm) wide, and between 1.12 and 1.16 inches (28 and 29 mm) high. It could be found in many Apple Macintosh in the early-to-mid-90s, but disappeared as the Mac moved to the PowerPC platform.

Intel also used the COASt standard for their Pentium systems, where it could be found as late as 1998 in Pentium MMX systems utilizing Intel chipsets such as 430VX and 430TX. Later, Intel combined this architecture with the CPU and created the Slot 1 CPU cartridge which contained both the CPU and separate cache chips.

The slot that the COASt module plugged into was named &quot;CELP&quot;, or &quot;card edge low profile&quot;, referring to the small circuit board and the conductors on its edge. It had 80 contacts on each side of a circuit board (for a total of 160), spaced 0.050&quot; apart, plus an identification notch between contacts 42 and 43.

== Operation ==
COASt modules provided either 256K or 512K of direct-mapped cache, organized as 8192 or 16384 lines of 32 bytes. A 64-bit data bus allowed the cache line to be transferred in a 4-cycle burst.

The modules contained 256K or 512K of fast pipeline burst SRAM, plus 8 or 11 bits of even faster static RAM per line to store the cache tags. (The module provides pins for 11 lines, but many motherboards and modules provided only 8.) Some variants (illustrated to the right) placed the tag RAM on the motherboard and only the main cache RAM was on the module.

Consider the 256K module first. An 8-bit tag allows caching memory up to 256 times the cache size, or 64 MiB. An 11-bit tag supports up to 512 MiB. Each cache line also has a valid bit and a dirty bit, stored in the cache controller. (16 Kbits, or 2 Kbytes, total size.)

A 512K module contains twice as many cache lines, and so requires one fewer tag bit to support the same cacheable memory size. The leftover tag bit is instead used to store the cache line dirty bit, and all 16 Kbits in the cache controller are used for valid bits.

<text>Llinos Golding, Baroness Golding (born 21 March 1933) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who currently sits in the House of Lords. She qualified as a radiographer and worked in the NHS, and is currently the Patron of the Society of Radiographers.

The daughter of MP Ness Edwards, Golding was the member of parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1986 to 2001, having replaced her husband John Golding. After stepping down at the 2001 general election, she was created a Life peer as Baroness Golding, of Newcastle-under-Lyme in the County of Staffordshire in the same year.

Baroness Golding was the peer who vouched for the two &#x27;Fathers for Justice&#x27; protesters who threw a flour bomb at Prime Minister Tony Blair during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 19 May 2004. By vouching for them, Golding made it possible for the pair to access an area of the Commons viewing gallery not behind a glass security screen. There is no suggestion that she had any idea of their protest plans. Later the same afternoon, she apologised to the Houses of Lords and Commons for her part in the affair.

She is a board member of the Countryside Alliance, a pro-hunting organisation.

She is Chairman of The Second Chance Children&#x27;s Charity (Charity Commission Registration No 1001462)

<doc id="523669" wikidata="Q2256794" url="?curid=523669" title="Brown Album">
<text>Brown Album is the fifth studio album by American rock band Primus. It was released on July 8, 1997, by Prawn Song and Interscope Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album with new drummer Brain, who replaced former drummer Tim Alexander. The album has received a mixed reception from critics and fans.

==Background==
&quot;Brown Album&quot; was the first Primus release to not feature drummer Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander and the first to feature Brain. Les Claypool stated &quot;Herb&#x27;s departure was like a marriage that just slowly decayed to an end... When it came down to it, we came very close to dissolving entirely, to ending Primus. I went to Ler and said, &#x27;Look, I&#x27;m not content anymore. We&#x27;ve got a good thing going between us and we should probably get a new drummer.&#x27; When we talked to Herb about it, he wasn&#x27;t surprised at all--in fact he seemed very relieved. He&#x27;s got his own thing now. He&#x27;s writing and singing [with his new band, Laundry] and he&#x27;s much happier.&quot; Regarding the name of the album, Claypool said &quot;This is a milestone record for Primus so it needed to have a milestone title. The Beatles have their &quot;White Album,&quot; Metallica have their &quot;Black Album,&quot; now Primus have their &quot;Brown Album.&quot;&quot;

According to Brain, the album was called the &quot;Brown Album&quot; because of the way the band approached the recording session; the mixes were done in the most unconventional ways that sounded like a &quot;muffled turd&quot;, hence the album title. According to Claypool, Tom Waits claimed it&#x27;s his favourite Primus album because &quot;It sounds like it needs a good wash&quot;.

==Musical style==
Claypool stated &quot;Song-wise I think &quot;Brown&quot; leans back to &quot;Suck&quot;... or [1990&#x27;s] &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s a far more aggressive album than we&#x27;ve done in a long time. The differences between this album and [ &quot;Punch Bowl&quot;...] are far greater than the differences between this album and the very early stuff.&quot;

The band decided to record and produce the album completely analog at their &quot;rancho relaxo&quot; recording studio in California. This approach would be completely reversed on the much more accessible &quot;Antipop&quot; album in 1999.

==Touring==
In 1997, Primus toured with Limp Bizkit and Powerman 5000, who had both released their major label debuts that year.

==Reception==

In his review for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine contends that &quot;the replacement of drummer Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander with Brian &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia doesn&#x27;t affect Primus&#x27; sound in any notable way&quot;, but also notes that the album &quot;moves Primus even further into progressive and jazz-rock territory&quot;. In conclusion, he describes &quot;Brown Album&quot; as &quot;standard Primus – all instrumental interplay and adolescent humor – but it&#x27;s delivered with more finesse and skill than ever.&quot; For &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Wook Kim describes the band as &quot;in decline&quot; since their &quot;satisfyingly eclectic&quot; early albums, noting that with &quot;Brown Album&quot; they &quot;cross that thin line between novel and novelty.&quot; The &quot;San Diego Union&quot; labeled the album as &quot;flat-sounding&quot;.

Tom Moon, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, describes &quot;Brown Album&quot; as &quot;precisely the type of weirdness that Primus have been peddling for years – progressive-rock instrumentals camouflaged in the tattered rags of punk and the absurdist narratives of a junior Zappa&quot;, although he notes that the songs &quot;all wind up sounding the same... Galumphing processionals more notable for their robotic persistence than for their musical invention.&quot; He calls the album &quot;more accessible&quot; in the way that it &quot;moves away from Primus&#x27; pet herky-jerky shifts of meter long enough to establish serious, straightforward grooves&quot;, but also &quot;more accomplished than inspired&quot; with an &quot;increasingly obvious soul deficit.&quot;

===Legacy and commercial performance===
Oran O&#x27;Beirne of &quot;Yahoo!&quot; reflected on the album on its 25th anniversary in July 2022, describing it as showcasing &quot;a unique form of psycho jazz, bass-oriented metal, and alt-rock psychedelia.&quot; The writer added, &quot;in hindsight, the band themselves regarded it a difficult album to digest, but there is a lot of magic between its grooves, along with a tremendous amount of passion and courageous soul that assisted Claypool and co in becoming one of the most highly regarded bands in the alt.metal/rock history books.&quot;

Claypool claimed the album was &quot;not as financially successful&quot;.

<doc id="523670" wikidata="Q199683" url="?curid=523670" title="List of states with limited recognition">
<text>A number of polities have declared independence and sought diplomatic recognition from the international community as sovereign states, but have not been universally recognised as such. These entities often have &quot;de facto&quot; control of their territory. A number of such entities have existed in the past.

There are two traditional theories used to indicate how a sovereign state comes into being. The declarative theory (codified in the 1933 Montevideo Convention) defines a state as a person in international law if it meets the following criteria:

# a defined territory
# a permanent population
# a government, and
# a capacity to enter into relations with other states.

According to the declarative theory, an entity&#x27;s statehood is independent of its recognition by other states. By contrast, the constitutive theory defines a state as a person of international law only if it is recognised as such by other states that are already a member of the international community.

Quasi-states often reference either or both doctrines in order to legitimise their claims to statehood. There are, for example, entities which meet the declarative criteria (with &quot;de facto&quot; partial or complete control over their claimed territory, a government and a permanent population), but whose statehood is not recognised by any other states. Non-recognition is often a result of conflicts with other countries that claim those entities as integral parts of their territory. In other cases, two or more partially recognised states may claim the same territorial area, with each of them &quot;de facto&quot; in control of a portion of it (for example, North Korea and South Korea, or the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China). Entities that are recognised by only a minority of the world&#x27;s states usually reference the declarative doctrine to legitimise their claims.

In many situations, international non-recognition is influenced by the presence of a foreign military force in the territory of the contested entity, making the description of the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; status problematic. The international community can judge this military presence too intrusive, reducing the entity to a puppet state where effective sovereignty is retained by the foreign power. Historical cases in this sense can be seen in Japanese-led Manchukuo or the German-created Slovak Republic and Independent State of Croatia before and during World War II. In the 1996 case &quot;Loizidou v. Turkey&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights judged Turkey for having exercised authority in the territory of Northern Cyprus.

There are also entities that do not have control over any territory or do not unequivocally meet the declarative criteria for statehood but have been recognised to exist as sovereign entities by at least one other state. Historically, this has happened in the case of the Holy See (1870–1929); Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (during Soviet annexation); and Palestine at the time of its declaration of independence in 1988. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is currently in this position. See list of governments in exile for unrecognised governments without control over the territory claimed.

== Criteria for inclusion ==
State practice relating to the recognition of a country typically falls somewhere between the &quot;declarative theory&quot; and &quot;constitutive theory&quot; approaches.

The criteria for inclusion on this list are limited to polities that claim sovereignty, lack recognition from at least one UN member state, and either:

* satisfy the declarative theory of statehood, &quot;or&quot;
* are recognised (constitutive theory) as a state by at least one UN member state.

== Background ==
There are United Nations (UN) member states, while both the Holy See and Palestine have observer state status in the United Nations. However, some countries that fulfill the declarative criteria, are recognised by the large majority of other states and are members of the United Nations are still included in the list here because one or more other states do not recognise their statehood, due to territorial claims or other conflicts.

Some states maintain informal (officially non-diplomatic) relations with states that do not officially recognise them. Taiwan (the Republic of China) is one such state, as it maintains unofficial relations with many other states through its Economic and Cultural Offices, which allow regular consular services. This allows Taiwan to have economic relations even with states that do not formally recognise it. A total of 56 states, including Germany, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom, maintain some form of unofficial mission in Taiwan. Kosovo, Northern Cyprus, Abkhazia, Transnistria, the Sahrawi Republic, Somaliland, and Palestine also host informal diplomatic missions, and/or maintain special delegations or other informal missions abroad.

== States that are state parties within the United Nations System ==


== States that are not state parties within the United Nations System ==


== Other entities with limited recognition of sovereignty ==
== Excluded entities ==
* Subnational entities and regions that function as &quot;de facto&quot; independent states, with the central government exercising little or no control over their territory, but that do not explicitly claim to be independent. Examples include Puntland in Somalia, the Gaza Strip in Palestine, the Kurdistan Region in Iraq, Rojava in Syria and the Wa State in Myanmar.
* Rebel groups that have declared independence and exert some control over territory, but that reliable sources do not describe as meeting the threshold of a sovereign state under international law. Examples include Ambazonia, the Houthi movement and the Southern Movement; see list of rebel groups that control territory for a more complete list of such groups.
* Those areas undergoing current civil wars and other situations with problems over government succession, regardless of temporary alignment with the inclusion criteria (e.g. by receiving recognition as state or legitimate government), where the conflict is still in its active phase, the situation is too rapidly changing and no relatively stable quasi-states have emerged yet.
* Those of the current irredentist movements and governments in exile that do not satisfy the inclusion criteria by simultaneously not satisfying the declarative theory and not having been recognised as a state or legitimate government by any other state.
* Entities considered to be micronations, even if they are recognised by another micronation. Even though micronations generally claim to be sovereign and independent, it is often debatable whether a micronation truly controls its claimed territory. For this reason, micronations are usually not considered of geopolitical relevance. For a list of micronations, see list of micronations.
* Uncontacted peoples who live in societies that cannot be defined as states or whose statuses as such are not definitively known.
* Some states can be slow to establish relations with new UN member states and thus do not explicitly recognise them, despite having no dispute and sometimes favorable relations. These are excluded from the list. Examples include Croatia and Montenegro.

<doc id="523672" wikidata="Q548162" url="?curid=523672" title="Yamamoto Tsunetomo">
<text>, Buddhist monastic name Yamamoto Jōchō (June 11, 1659 – November 30, 1719), was a samurai of the Saga Domain in Hizen Province under his lord Nabeshima Mitsushige. He became a Zen Buddhist priest and relayed his experiences, memories, lessons, ideas, and aphorisms to the samurai , who compiled them under the title &quot;Hagakure.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Yamamoto Tsunetomo was born 11 June 1659 to Yamamoto Jin&#x27;emon, then aged 71, and a woman whose maiden name was Maeda. He was the last born to the family, and regarded by his father as a superfluous addition who was intended to be given away to a salt merchant. For most of his childhood, Tsunetomo was sickly and claimed doctors told him he would not live past twenty years old. Despite his fragile health, he was employed at age 9 to be a page for Nabeshima Mitsuhige. Tsunetomo&#x27;s skills in literature led Mitsuhige to have him study under noted man of letters Kuranaga Rihei.

In his twenties, Tsunetomo studied under the Zen Buddhist priest Tannen and the Confucian scholar Ishida Ittei, both of whom greatly influenced his philosophy. The last major influence in Tsunetomo&#x27;s education was his nephew Yamamoto Gorōzaemon, who was older than Tsunetomo and helped him get a position as a scribe in Edo and then in the imperial capital Kyoto in 1686. In 1687, Gorōzaemon took responsibility for a large destructive fire, leading to him and Tsunetomo both resigning from their positions. Tsunetomo returned to work for Mitsuhige.

== Buddhist priesthood ==
In 1695, Mitsushige retired due to ill health, and tasked Tsunetomo with finding a copy of a book of secret poetry instructions called &quot;Kokindenju&quot;. Tsunetomo obtained a copy in Kyoto and on 1 May 1700, presented it to Mitsuhige, who died two weeks later. Tsunetomo intended to commit suicide to follow his master in death, but both Mitsushige and the shogunate as a whole had banned the practice. Instead of continuing as a samurai seeking minor positions, Tsunetomo became a Buddhist priest and his wife became a nun, living in a hermitage in the mountains.

==&quot;Hagakure&quot;==

Later in life, (between 1709 and 1716), Tsunetomo narrated many of his thoughts to the samurai . Many of these aphorisms concerned his lord&#x27;s father and grandfather Naoshige and the failing ways of the samurai caste. These commentaries were compiled and published in 1716 under the title of &quot;Hagakure&quot; (葉隠), a word that can be translated as either &quot;In the Shadow of Leaves&quot; or &quot;Hidden Leaves&quot;.

The &quot;Hagakure&quot; was not widely known during the years following Tsunetomo&#x27;s death, but by the 1930s it had become one of the most famous representatives of &quot;bushido&quot; taught in Japan. In 2011 a manga/comic book version was published &quot;Hagakure: The Manga Edition&quot;, translated by William Scott Wilson, adapted by Sean Michael Wilson and Chie Kutsuwada (Kodansha International Ltd., 2011).

Tsunetomo believed that becoming one with death in one&#x27;s thoughts, even in life, was the highest attainment of purity and focus. He felt that a resolution to die gives rise to a higher state of life, infused with beauty and grace beyond the reach of those concerned with self-preservation. Some viewed him as a man of immediate action due to some of his quotes, and in the &quot;Hagakure&quot; he criticized the carefully planned Akō vendetta of the Forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; (a major event in his lifetime) for its delayed response.

== Legacy ==
During Japan&#x27;s militarist years in the 1930s and 1940s, soldiers hailed &quot;Hagakure&quot; as a key text for proper samurai behaviour.

The Hagakure was the book that the character Ghost Dog reads and lives his life by in the movie &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;.

<doc id="523674" wikidata="Q2518436" url="?curid=523674" title="Pyridinium">
<text>Pyridinium refers to the cation . It is the conjugate acid of pyridine. Many related cations are known involving substituted pyridines, e.g. picolines, lutidines, collidines. They are prepared by treating pyridine with acids.

As pyridine is often used as an organic base in chemical reactions, pyridinium salts are produced in many acid-base reactions. Its salts are often insoluble in the organic solvent, so precipitation of the pyridinium leaving group complex is an indication of the progress of the reaction.

Pyridinium cations are aromatic, as determined through Hückel&#x27;s rule. They are isoelectronic with benzene.

==&quot;N&quot;-Alkylpyridinium cations==

When the acidic proton is replaced by alkyl, the compounds are called &quot;N&quot;-alkylpyridinium. A simple representative is &quot;N&quot;-methylpyridinium (). These pyridinium intermediates have been used as electrophiles in synthetic organic chemistry to build dearomatized congeners called dihydropyridines, as demonstrated in one example from Smith in 2021. Earlier, the same research group also delineated the rules surrounding regioselectivities associated with adding nucleophiles to pyridinium electrophiles with varying substituents. From a commercial perspective, an important pyridinium compound is the herbicide paraquat.

<text>Ali Kemal Sunal (11 November 1944 – 3 July 2000) was a Turkish actor and comedian. With &quot;Hababam Sınıfı&quot;, &quot;Kapıcılar Kralı&quot; and &quot;Davaro&quot;, Sunal gained large popularity amongst Turkish cinema goers and was famed for his character &quot;Şaban&quot;, a role he frequently played.

== Career ==
Kemal Sunal graduated from Vefa Lisesi (Vefa High School). In his early ages, he started pursuing what was to become a long and successful acting career in minor roles in various theatres. For a brief period, he worked in the Kenterler Theatre and debuted in the play &quot;Zoraki Tabip&quot;. He was later transferred to the Devekuşu Kabare Theatre, where he performed his acting.

He was recognized as a real talent, and started receiving offers for movies with larger budgets and a more famous cast. His first bigger role was in the film &quot;Tatlı Dillim&quot; directed by Ertem Eğilmez. In a matter of years, Sunal co-starred alongside Halit Akçatepe, Şener Şen and Münir Özkul.

Perhaps the most famous of all his parts was when he played in &quot;Hababam Sınıfı&quot; (The Outrageous Class) and was known by the name of &quot;Şaban&quot;, but most of his classmates just called him &quot;İnek&quot; (nerd) Şaban. İnek Şaban was constantly bullied and humiliated by his friends, but this never kept him from thinking the unthinkable, like digging a tunnel to escape school grounds (which later, turned out to lead to the vice-principal&#x27;s office) or smoking in the school attic. The character was so pure and so fixed in the memories of the Turkish people, it was never replaced by another actor in the recent re-shootings of &quot;Hababam Sınıfı&quot;, most probably as a sign of respect to Sunal.

His other notable characters include: Tosun Paşa; Süt Kardeş Şaban; Çöpçüler Kralı, who fell in love with a municipality officer&#x27;s fiancée; Doktor Civanım, a former hospital janitor pretending to be a doctor upon his return to his home village; and finally &quot;Orta Direk Şaban&quot;, a naive man trying to become an athlete to impress his crush.

The huge popularity of his movies stemmed not only from their unique humour but also their depiction of the many problems faced by the poor rural people in Turkey during the 1970s and 1980s. In almost all of his films, Kemal Sunal plays a poor man, trying to make a living.

Sunal&#x27;s last film was &quot;Propaganda&quot;, which was directed by Sinan Çetin. Sunal, played a customs officer-in-charge (presumably) on the Syrian border Being a serious drama, this film was a contrast to his other works. As the plot unfolded, Sunal&#x27;s character fell into despair, trying to survive the dilemma between his duties as an officer of the law and his duties as a friend. In the public opinion, this film was not the best of his works. Another significant fact about this film is that it also included Ali Sunal, Kemal Sunal&#x27;s son, cast as a junior customs officer.

== Personal life ==

Sunal kept himself and his family away from the media and rarely appeared in public. People who knew him have commented on how serious he was in his real life, in contrast to the funny characters he played in his movies. Whilst he was at the top of his career, he decided to finish university, which he had dropped out of in his early career. Despite his fame, he attended the university like a regular student and stated that &quot;that was the way he liked it to be&quot;.

Sunal&#x27;s dreams of higher-education were disrupted in 1980, during the period of military takeover. His attempts to earn a degree finally paid off in 1995, when he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Radio Television and Cinema Studies from Marmara University. He then decided to pursue a master&#x27;s degree (the topic of this thesis being himself), which he earned in 1998, also from Marmara University. This incident was covered by the media with headlines like &quot;İnek Şaban Master Yaptı&quot; (Şaban the Geek got a master&#x27;s degree) while his &#x27;classmates&#x27; from Hababam Sinifi made comments like &quot;Profesorluk Bekliyoruz&quot; (&quot;We expect professorship&quot;). At his graduation ceremony, he made a speech joking that his path of first working and then attending university later in life was better as it allowed him to gain real life experience first.

==Death==
Kemal Sunal died on July 3, 2000, as a result of a sudden heart attack aboard a flight to Trabzon just before take-off. He was reported to be afraid of flying. His death caused mourning that swept the entire nation and dominated news coverage for many days. He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul.

Kemal Sunal and his wife Gül Sunal (born 1957) had two children, Ali Sunal (born 1977) and Ezo Sunal (born 1985).

<text>Harold James Plaskett (born 18 March 1960) is a British chess grandmaster and writer.

==Biography==

===Early life and personal life===
Plaskett was born in Dhekelia, Cyprus, on 18 March 1960 and was educated at Bedford Modern School, England. In the 1990s he was a chess columnist for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; while working various jobs in London. He is married to the poet Fiona Pitt-Kethley. They relocated to Cartagena, Spain in 2002.

===Chess career===
At the European Junior Chess Championship 1978/79, which was won by John van der Wiel, Plaskett came third with 8 points out of 13 games. At the Junior EC 1979/80 Plaskett reached a shared fourth place with 8.5 points out of 13 games.

Plaskett achieved the title of International Master in 1981, and became an International Grandmaster in 1985. At the Hastings tournament in 1986/87 he achieved 7 points out of 13 games, one point less than the winner Murray Chandler.

He became British Chess Champion in 1990, with 9 points out of 11 games. In 1998 he played in the 73rd Hastings tournament, which was won by Matthew Sadler; James Plaskett reached fifth place with 4.5/9. 

As of 2018 he continues to be active in chess in Spain.

He has written nine chess books.

In 1987, at a top-flight chess tournament in Brussels, he presented an endgame study composed circa 1970 by endgame composer Gijs van Breukelen. As a result, the famous study is now known as Plaskett&#x27;s Puzzle.

===Coincidences===
Plaskett has been recording his own experiences of coincidences since the 1980s. He has said that the coincidences have seemed to proliferate in response to his own study, and have been seemingly interlinked by recurrent themes or motifs, which he felt may be &quot;an indicator of something glimpsed but yet to be clearly seen or understood.&quot; He is the author of a semi-autobiographical book, &quot;Coincidences&quot;.

===Giant Octopus===
Another of Plaskett&#x27;s interests has been the pursuit of the cryptid, the &quot;Giant Octopus&quot;. He undertook a three-week expedition in search of it in the waters off the Bermudan coast in August 1999, in collaboration with Cliff Stanford of Demon Internet.

===Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?===
After appearing four times at the qualifying stage of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, Plaskett, who had arrived with fellow grandmaster and friend Stuart Conquest, got into the hot seat on the show broadcast on 21 January 2006. After becoming the seventh person to reach £125,000 without using any lifelines, he went on to win £250,000.

He has been public in his defence of contestants Charles Ingram, Diana Ingram, and Tecwen Whittock, who were found guilty of cheating to win the £1 million top prize by means of cough signals. Plaskett told journalist Jon Ronson that the alleged cough signals were simply nervous, responsive coughing caused by unconscious triggers, and that they had also occurred during the legitimate win by Judith Keppel. In 2015, Plaskett and journalist Bob Woffinden collaborated on a book asserting that the Ingrams were innocent. The book, titled &quot;Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major&quot;, was published in January 2015. Plaskett&#x27;s book on the Ingram affair inspired a stage play by James Graham, called &quot;Quiz&quot;. That later spawned a three part TV Drama of the same name directed by Sir Stephen Frears.

<doc id="523680" wikidata="Q838960" url="?curid=523680" title="Stretcher">
<text>A stretcher, gurney, litter, or pram is an apparatus used for moving patients who require medical care. A basic type (cot or litter) must be carried by two or more people. A wheeled stretcher (known as a gurney, trolley, bed or cart) is often equipped with variable height frames, wheels, tracks, or skids. 

Stretchers are primarily used in acute out-of-hospital care situations by emergency medical services (EMS), military, and search and rescue personnel. In medical forensics, the right arm of a corpse is left hanging off the stretcher to let paramedics know it is a deceased person. They are also used to hold prisoners during lethal injections in the United States.

==History==
An early stretcher, likely made of wicker over a frame, appears in a manuscript from . Simple stretchers were common with militaries right through the middle of the 20th century.

==Gurney==
Generally spelled &quot;gurney&quot;, but also &quot;guerney&quot; or &quot;girney&quot;. The first usage of the term for a wheeled stretcher is unclear, but it is believed to have been derived from Pacific Coast slang. Its use in a hospital context was established by the 1930s.

==Classification==
EMS stretchers used in ambulances have wheels that makes transportation over pavement easier, and have a lock inside the ambulance and straps to secure the patient during transport. An integral lug on the stretcher locks into a sprung latch within the ambulance in order to prevent movement during transport. Modern stretchers may also have battery-powered hydraulics to raise and collapse the legs automatically. This eases the workload on EMS personnel, who are statistically at high risk of back injury from repetitive raising and lowering of patients. Specialized bariatric stretchers are also available, which feature a wider frame and higher weight capacity for heavier patients. Stretchers are usually covered with a disposable sheet or wrapping, and are cleaned after each use to prevent the spread of infection. Shelves, hooks and poles for medical equipment and intravenous medication are also frequently included.

Standard stretchers have several adjustments. The bed can be raised or lowered to facilitate patient transfer. The head of the stretcher can be raised so that the patient is in a sitting position (especially important for those in respiratory distress) or lowered flat in order to perform CPR, or for patients with suspected spinal injury who must be transported on a spinal board. The feet can be raised to what is called the Trendelenburg position, indicated for patients in shock.

Some manufacturers have begun to offer hybrid devices that combine the functionality of a stretcher, a recliner chair, and a treatment or procedural table into one device.

=== Basic stretchers ===
* Simple stretchers are the most rudimentary type. They are lightweight and portable, made of canvas or other synthetic material suspended between two poles or tubular aluminum frame. Many are stored as disaster supplies and are often former military equipment.
* The folding stretcher, also known as a &quot;top deck&quot; or &quot;collapsible stretcher&quot;, is similar in design to the simple stretcher, but features one or more hinged points of articulation to allow the stretcher to be collapsed into a more compact form for easier handling or storage. Some models may even allow the patient to sit upright in a Fowler&#x27;s or Semi-Fowler&#x27;s position.
* The Roberson orthopedic stretcher or &quot;scoop stretcher&quot; is used for lifting patients, for instance from the ground onto an ambulance stretcher or onto a spinal board. The two ends of the stretcher can be detached from each other, splitting the stretcher into two longitudinal halves. To load a patient, one or both ends of the stretcher are detached, the halves placed under the patient from either side and fastened back together. With obese patients, the possibility exists of accidentally pinching the patient&#x27;s back when closing the stretcher, so care must be made not to injure them when carrying out this procedure.
* The &quot;litter&quot;, also known as a basket stretcher or &quot;Stokes litter,&quot; is designed to be used where there are obstacles to movement or other hazards: for example, in confined spaces, on slopes, in wooded terrain. Typically it is shaped to accommodate an adult in a face up position and it is used in search and rescue operations. The person is strapped into the basket, making safe evacuation possible. The litter has raised sides and often includes a removable head/torso cover for patient protection. After the person is secured in the litter, the litter may be wheeled, carried by hand, mounted on an ATV, towed behind skis, snowmobile, or horse, lifted or lowered on high angle ropes, or hoisted by helicopter.
* The &quot;WauK board&quot; is also designed for use in small spaces. The patient is secured to the board with straps. It has two wheels and a foldable footrest at one end, allowing the patient to be moved by one person, much as with a hand truck for moving cargo. It can also be used at a variety of angles, making it easier to traverse obstacles, such as tight stairwells.
* The Neil Robertson stretcher is a stretcher designed for securely transporting injured individuals through narrow and confined spaces, such as steep ladders, small hatchways, and narrow passages. The Neil Robertson stretcher is widely used in maritime settings, particularly by naval forces and maritime rescue team.

=== Flexible stretchers ===
A flexible stretcher, also known by the brand names Reeves sleeve or SKED, is a stretcher that is often supported longitudinally by wooden or plastic planks. Essentially a tarpaulin with handles, it is primarily used to move a patient through confined spaces, e.g., a narrow hallway, or to lift obese patients. Reeves stretchers have six handholds, allowing multiple rescuers to assist extrication.

=== Wheeled stretchers ===
For ambulances, a collapsible wheeled stretcher, or gurney, is a type of stretcher on a variable-height wheeled frame. Normally, an integral lug on the stretcher locks into a sprung latch within the ambulance in order to prevent movement during transport, often referred to as antlers due to their shape. It is usually covered with a disposable sheet and cleaned after each patient in order to prevent the spread of infection. Its key value is to facilitate moving the patient and sheet onto a fixed bed or table on arrival at the emergency department. Both types may have straps to secure the patient.

=== Other types of stretchers ===
* The Nimier stretcher (&quot;brancard Nimier&quot;) was a type of stretcher used by the French army during World War I. The casualty was placed on their back, but in a &quot;seated position&quot;, (that is, the thighs were perpendicular to the abdomen). Thus, the stretcher was shorter and could turn in the trenches. This type of stretcher is rarely seen today.

<text>Xidi () is a village in Xidi Town (), Yi County, Huangshan City of the historical Huizhou region of Anhui province, China. Xidi and the nearby town of Hongcun are known for their exceptional preservation of rural Anhui architecture and city planning during medieval China, and together they were declared the &quot;Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui&quot; World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.

== History ==
First built during the Huangyou era (1049–1053) of Song dynasty Emperor Renzong, the village was originally called &quot;Xichuan&quot; (West River), owing to the water courses flowing through it.

The Hu family of Xidi are descended from Hu Shiliang, from Wuyuan, who was a descendant of Hu Changyi, a son of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang who was adopted by the Wuyuan Hu family.

The rise of the village was closely tied to the fortunes of the Hu family. By 1465 CE, during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), family members had started in business as merchants, leading to construction of major private buildings and a public infrastructure. By the middle of the 17th century, the influence wielded by members of the Hu family expanded from commerce into politics. The prosperity of Xidi peaked in the 18th and 19th centuries, at which time the village comprised about 600 residences. However, during the late 19th century, the disintegration of the feudal system in China and the decline of merchant communities across Anhui cause the expansion of Xidi to cease 

==City Plan==
Xidi has maintained its original street plan and water systems from the medieval period. The street pattern of Xidi is dominated by a main road which runs in an east–west direction and is flanked by two parallel streets. These major streets are joined by many narrow alleyways. These streets are paved with original Yi County granite. Small open spaces are confined to areas immediately in front of the main public buildings, such as the &quot;Hall of Respect&quot;, the &quot;Hall of Reminiscence&quot;, and the &quot;Memorial Archway of the Governor&quot;. As was typical for the time, the buildings are clustered near the three streams that make up the city. In the city, there are 224 ancient residential buildings, dating from between the 14th and 19th centuries. Of those, there are 124 well-preserved wooden residences from the Ming and Qing dynasties with beautiful carvings form the major attractions. The residences usually contain a central courtyard surrounded by symmetrical bays of rooms. Many of these residences are open to the public.

<text>The Montmorency Falls () is a large waterfall on the Montmorency River in Quebec, Canada.

==Location==
The falls are located on the boundary between the borough of Beauport and Boischatel, about from the heart of old Quebec City. The area surrounding the falls is protected within the Montmorency Falls Park (). The falls are at the mouth of the Montmorency River where it drops over the cliff shore into the Saint Lawrence River, opposite the western end of the Île d&#x27;Orleans. The waterfalls are 83 m (272&#x27;) tall, a full 30 m (99&#x27;) higher than Niagara Falls.

==Access and tourism==
Around 970,000 visitors a year visit Montmorency Falls. There are staircases that allow visitors to view the falls from several different perspectives. A suspension bridge over the crest of the falls provides access to both sides of the park. There is also a funitel that carries passengers between the base and the top of the falls. In the summer the park hosts an international fireworks competition with the falls as a backdrop.

During summer months, the falls give off a yellow glow due to high iron content in the waterbed.

The Ice Hotel was located at Montmorency Falls for its first year in 2001.

In July 2019, it was announced that the Montmorency Falls tourist site would be getting a $33-million makeover.

== In popular culture ==
The Falls were the site of a key scene between the lead actors in the 1947 film &quot;Whispering City&quot;, which was filmed on location.

In his poem &quot;Sleep and Poetry&quot; (1816), John Keats says that human life is &quot;a poor Indian&#x27;s sleep / While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep / Of Montmorency.&quot; Recreational sleighing on the frozen falls is recorded in Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration, &quot;The Montmorency Waterfall and Cone&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by W. Purser, published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836.
The Falls appeared during the finale of &quot;The Amazing Race Canada 5&quot; in 2017 and were the site of the episode&#x27;s first task in which competitors scaled a cargo net suspended over the Falls.

<doc id="523699" wikidata="Q2339094" url="?curid=523699" title="Chiliagon">
<text>In geometry, a chiliagon () or 1,000-gon is a polygon with 1,000 sides. Philosophers commonly refer to chiliagons to illustrate ideas about the nature and workings of thought, meaning, and mental representation.

== Regular chiliagon==
A &quot;regular chiliagon&quot; is represented by Schläfli symbol {1,000} and can be constructed as a truncated 500-gon, t{500}, or a twice-truncated 250-gon, tt{250}, or a thrice-truncated 125-gon, ttt{125}.

The measure of each internal angle in a regular chiliagon is 179°38&#x27;24&quot; or formula_1rad. The area of a regular chiliagon with sides of length &quot;a&quot; is given by
:formula_2

This result differs from the area of its circumscribed circle by less than 4 parts per million.

Because 1,000 = 23 × 53, the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular chiliagon is not a constructible polygon. Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes, nor a product of powers of two and three. Therefore, construction of a chiliagon requires other techniques such as the quadratrix of Hippias, Archimedean spiral, or other auxiliary curves. For example, a 9° angle can first be constructed with compass and straightedge, which can then be quintisected (divided into five equal parts) twice using an auxiliary curve to produce the 21&#x27;36&quot; internal angle required.

==Philosophical application==
René Descartes uses the chiliagon as an example in his Sixth Meditation to demonstrate the difference between pure intellection and imagination. He says that, when one thinks of a chiliagon, he &quot;does not imagine the thousand sides or see them as if they were present&quot; before him – as he does when one imagines a triangle, for example. The imagination constructs a &quot;confused representation,&quot; which is no different from that which it constructs of a myriagon (a polygon with ten thousand sides). However, he does clearly understand what a chiliagon is, just as he understands what a triangle is, and he is able to distinguish it from a myriagon. Therefore, the intellect is not dependent on imagination, Descartes claims, as it is able to entertain clear and distinct ideas when imagination is unable to. Philosopher Pierre Gassendi, a contemporary of Descartes, was critical of this interpretation, believing that while Descartes could imagine a chiliagon, he could not understand it: one could &quot;perceive that the word &#x27;chiliagon&#x27; signifies a figure with a thousand angles [but] that is just the meaning of the term, and it does not follow that you understand the thousand angles of the figure any better than you imagine them.&quot;

The example of a chiliagon is also referenced by other philosophers. David Hume points out that it is &quot;impossible for the eye to determine the angles of a chiliagon to be equal to 1.996 right angles, or make any conjecture, that approaches this proportion.&quot; Gottfried Leibniz comments on a use of the chiliagon by John Locke, noting that one can have an idea of the polygon without having an image of it, and thus distinguishing ideas from images. Immanuel Kant refers instead to the enneacontahexagon (96-gon), but responds to the same question raised by Descartes.

Henri Poincaré uses the chiliagon as evidence that &quot;intuition is not necessarily founded on the evidence of the senses&quot; because &quot;we can not represent to ourselves a chiliagon, and yet we reason by intuition on polygons in general, which include the chiliagon as a particular case.&quot;

Inspired by Descartes&#x27;s chiliagon example, Roderick Chisholm and other 20th-century philosophers have used similar examples to make similar points. Chisholm&#x27;s &quot;speckled hen&quot;, which need not have a determinate number of speckles to be successfully imagined, is perhaps the most famous of these.

== Symmetry==

The &quot;regular chiliagon&quot; has Dih1000 dihedral symmetry, order 2000, represented by 1,000 lines of reflection. Dih1000 has 15 dihedral subgroups: Dih500, Dih250, Dih125, Dih200, Dih100, Dih50, Dih25, Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5, Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, and Dih1. It also has 16 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: Z1000, Z500, Z250, Z125, Z200, Z100, Z50, Z25, Z40, Z20, Z10, Z5, Z8, Z4, Z2, and Z1, with Zn representing π/&quot;n&quot; radian rotational symmetry.

John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter. He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry.

These lower symmetries allow degrees of freedom in defining irregular chiliagons. Only the g1000 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

==Chiliagram==
A chiliagram is a 1,000-sided star polygon. There are 199 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols of the form {1000/&quot;n&quot;}, where &quot;n&quot; is an integer between 2 and 500 that is coprime to 1,000. There are also 300 regular star figures in the remaining cases.

For example, the regular {1000/499} star polygon is constructed by 1000 nearly radial edges. Each star vertex has an internal angle of 0.36 degrees.

<doc id="523701" wikidata="Q217057" url="?curid=523701" title="Clonmel">
<text>Clonmel () is the county town and largest settlement of County Tipperary, Ireland. The town is noted in Irish history for its resistance to the Cromwellian army which sacked the towns of Drogheda and Wexford. With the exception of the townland of Suir Island, most of the borough is situated in the civil parish of &quot;St Mary&#x27;s&quot; which is part of the ancient barony of Iffa and Offa East.

==Etymology==

The name Clonmel is derived from the anglicisation of the Irish name &quot;Cluain Meala&quot; meaning &quot;honey meadow&quot; or &quot;honey valley&quot;. While it is not clearly known when it got this name, some sources suggest that it is associated with the fertility of the soil and the &quot;richness of the country&quot; in which it is located.

== History ==
===Town walls===
Clonmel grew significantly in medieval times and was protected by town walls. A small section of the town walls remains in place near Old St. Mary&#x27;s Church. This church was originally built in the 14th century or earlier but has been reconstructed or renovated on numerous occasions. It was fortified early in its history, the town being strategically important, initially for the Earls of Ormonde, and later the Earl of Kildare. Some fortified parts of the church were destroyed or damaged during the mid-17th century Cromwellian occupation.

One of the former entry points into the town is now the site of the West Gate, a 19th-century reconstruction of an older structure. There were originally three gates in the walled town, North, East and West – with the South being protected by the river Suir and the Comeragh Mountains. The West Gate is now an open arched entrance onto O&#x27;Connell Street, the main street of the town.

===Elizabethan era===
On 17 September 1583, while a fugitive during the last stages of the Second Desmond Rebellion, Fr. Muiris Mac Ionrachtaigh, chaplain and confessor to the Rebel Earl of Desmond, was taken prisoner upon Sliabh Luachra and taken to Clonmel for imprisonment, while he continued his priestly ministry to the best of his ability.

According to historian James Coombes, &quot;Here, as in other southern towns, Counter-Reformation Catholicism was already beginning to make a real impact; and, as in these other towns, the citizens of Clonmel were beginning to come up against the problem of combining loyalty to the Pope with loyalty to the Queen. Maurice MacKenraghty continued his ministry during what proved to be a long imprisonment&quot;.

In April 1585, his jailer was bribed by Victor White, a leading townsman, to release the priest for one night to say Mass and administer Communion in White&#x27;s house on Easter Sunday (11 April 1585). Permission was granted, and Fr. MacKenraghty spent the whole night hearing Confessions.

The jailer, however, had secretly tipped off the President of Munster Sir John Norris, who had just arrived at Clonmel. According to historian James Coombes, &quot;Norris arranged to have White&#x27;s house surrounded by soldiers and raided. The raiding party entered it shortly before Mass was due to begin and naturally caused great panic. Some people tried to hide in the basement; others jumped through the windows; one woman broke her arm in an attempt to escape. The priest hid in a heap of straw and was wounded in the thigh by the probing sword of a soldier. Despite the pain, he remained silent and later escaped. The soldiers dismantled the altar and seized the sacred vessels&quot;.

According to historian Judy Barry, Fr. Mac Ionrachtaigh, &quot;surrendered himself when he learned that White would otherwise be executed in his place. He refused to take the oath of supremacy and was condemned to death. On 30 April 1585 he was tied to the tail of a horse and taken to the market place, where he was partially hanged. Accounts differ as to whether his executioners were persuaded to behead him without quartering his body. At all events, after his remains had been exhibited for some days on the market cross, they were handed over to local Catholics for honourable burial&quot;.

According to historian James Coombes, the former location of Victor White&#x27;s house near Lough Street in Clonmel continued to be nicknamed &quot;Martyr Lane&quot; until well into Cromwellian times. Fr. Muiris Mac Ionrachtaigh was beatified by Pope John Paul II, along with 16 other Irish Catholic Martyrs, on 27 September 1992.

===Corporation regalia===
Under a charter granted by James I of England, Clonmel became a Free Borough on 5 July 1608, and the Mayor and officers of the town were granted the power to &quot;name, elect and constitute one Swordbearer and three Sergeants-at-Mace&quot;. The present sword and two silver maces date only from Cromwellian times. The sword, of Toledo manufacture, was donated by Sir Thomas Stanley in 1656 and displays the Arms and motto of the town. The larger mace is stamped 1663.

===Cromwellian period===
Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Clonmel in May 1650. The walls were eventually breached, but Hugh Dubh O&#x27;Neill, the commander of the town&#x27;s garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the New Model Army when they tried to storm the breach. That night, O&#x27;Neill, deciding that further resistance was hopeless due to a lack of ammunition, led his soldiers and camp followers out of the town under cover of darkness. The story is told that Cromwell became suspicious of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s desperate situation when a silver bullet was discharged by the townspeople at his troops outside the walls. The following morning, 18 May 1650, mayor John White was able to surrender the town on good terms as Cromwell was still unaware of the garrison&#x27;s escape just hours before. Although feeling deceived, Cromwell did not put the inhabitants &#x27;to the sword&#x27; as occurred elsewhere.

After being denounced by three men who desired the £5 bounty and arrested at Fethard while vested for Mass on Holy Saturday, 25 March, 1654, Augustinian Friar William Tirry was taken to Clonmel Gaol (on the future site of the Clonmel Borstal) and held there pending trial. On 26 April, he was tried by a jury and Commonwealth judges, including Colonel Solomon Richards, for violating the Proclamation of 6 January 1653, which defined it as high treason for priests to remain in Ireland. In his own defense, Fr. Tirry replied that while he viewed the Commonwealth as the lawful Government, he had no choice but to disobey its laws, as the Pope had ordered him to remain in Ireland. Fr. Tirry was according found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out in Clonmel on 2 May 1654.

An account told by Franciscan Friar Matthew Fogarty, who had been tried with Friar William Tirry, supplies further details: &quot;William, wearing his Augustinian habit, was led to the gallows praying the rosary. He blessed the crowd which had gathered, pardoned his betrayers and affirmed his faith. It was a moving moment for Catholics and Protestants alike.&quot;

Despite the efforts of a Puritan minister to silence him, Fr. Tirry told the assembled crowd, &quot;there is only one true Church, whose head is the pope: Pope and Church are to be obeyed. He publicly forgave the three men who had betrayed him, and... stated explicitly that he had been offered life and favour, it would renounce his religion.&quot; Fr. Tirry was then hanged, after which he was buried, with some ceremony, in the ruins of the Augustinian friary in nearby Fethard. The evidence is that he was buried in the grounds, rather than inside the ruins of the church, but it has not yet been possible to locate his grave. Fr. William Tirry was beatified by Pope John Paul II along with 16 other Irish Catholic Martyrs on 27 September 1993. The Augustinian order celebrates his feast day on 12 May.

===18th century===
During the second half of the 18th century, the &quot;Sean-nós&quot; song &quot;Príosún Chluain Meala&quot; was composed inside Clonmel Gaol by one O&#x27;Donnell, a member of the Whiteboys originally from Iveragh, County Kerry, who was being held awaiting execution by hanging upon the following Friday. According to Donal O&#x27;Sullivan, O&#x27;Donnell had two companions awaiting the rope with him and that their heads were posthumously severed from their bodies and displayed spiked upon the prison gates. &quot;The Gaol of Cluain Meala&quot;, an English translation of the lyrics, was made by County Cork poet Jeremiah Joseph Callanan (1795–1829).

===19th century===
A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Kickham Barracks in 1805. During an 1807 visit to Ireland on behalf of the London Hibernian Society, Welsh nonconformist minister Thomas Charles alleged ruefully that the Reformation in Ireland had failed because of the refusal of Protestant clergy to preach or educate in the local vernacular. Of his visit to Clonmel, Rev. Charles recalled, &quot;All the county spoke Irish... they spoke Irish in the streets.&quot; 

Following the failed attempt at rebellion near Ballingarry in 1848, the captured leaders of the Young Irelanders were brought to Clonmel for trial. The event was followed with great interest internationally and for its duration brought journalists from around the country and Britain to Clonmel Courthouse. Standing in the dock in the image opposite is Thomas Francis Meagher, Terence MacManus and Patrick O&#x27;Donoghue. Their co-defendant, William Smith O&#x27;Brien was also sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the last occasions such a sentence was handed down in Ireland. When delivering the guilty verdict, the foreman of the Grand Jury, R.M. Southcote Mansergh, great-grandfather of the academic Nicholas Mansergh stated:

We earnestly recommend the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the Government, being unanimously of opinion that for many reasons his life should be spared.

The sentences of O&#x27;Brien and other members of the Irish Confederation were eventually commuted to transportation for life to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. A conspiracy to rescue the prisoners on 8 November led by John O&#x27;Leary and Philip Gray was betrayed and resulted in the arrest at &#x27;The Wilderness&#x27; of seventeen armed rebels led by Gray.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Clonmel was the location of the foundation of the Labour Party in 1912 by James Connolly, James Larkin and William O&#x27;Brien as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress.

In November 2015, the town was the location of Ireland&#x27;s first marriage between two men.

== Administration and politics ==

Clonmel was one of ten boroughs retained by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. The borough corporation elected 12 councillors. The first mayor of Clonmel Borough in 1843 was John Hackett. Clonmel Town Hall was opened in 1882.

Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the area became an urban district, while its body retained the style of a borough corporation. The borough corporation became a borough council in 2002. On 1 June 2014, the borough council was dissolved and administration of the town was amalgamated into Tipperary County Council. Pat English was the last Mayor of Clonmel Borough Council.

Clonmel retains the right to be described as a borough. The chair of the borough district uses the title of mayor, rather than Cathaoirleach. As of the 2019 Tipperary County Council election, the local electoral area of Clonmel elected 6 councillors.

As of 2024, Clonmel is within Dáil constituency of Tipperary South which elects three TDs to Dáil Éireann (the Irish parliament).

==Geography==
The town is built in the valley of the River Suir. It divides the town which is mainly located on the north bank. To the south, the town is surrounded by the Comeragh Mountains and Slievenamon to the northeast. To the north, east and west is some of Ireland&#x27;s richest farmland, known as the Golden Vale. The town covers a land area of approximately 11.59 km2.

===Climate===
===Flood defences===
The River Suir floods the local area after very heavy rainfalls in the up-river catchment area of 2,173 km2. The Office of Public Works (OPW) completed and installed a Flood Forecasting System which has been used since 2007. The flood of 2015 had a flow of 390m3/s, 2004 had a flow of 354m3/s with the flood of 2000 having a flow of 353m3/s. The 2015 flood was the worst since that of 1946, which had seen a flow of 479m3/s. Phase 1 of the Clonmel Flood Defence (planned to cope with a 100-year flood) started in 2007. It was scheduled to be completed by late 2009. Phases two and three were completed by 2012. Property omitted from Phase 1 along the Convent Road were protected in 2014 and the access to the river for the workmen&#x27;s boat club was also raised. 
Flooding of October 2014 was less than a 1–5 flood with a flow of 300m3/s. As part of a media exercise by the OPW the barriers were all put up.

The flood defence consists of demountable barriers, walls and earth banks. Flooding occurred at the Gashouse Bridge, Coleville Road, Davis Road, the Quays and the Old Bridge area before the flood defences.

==Demographics==

The 2016 census used a new boundary created by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to define the town of Clonmel and environs, resulting in a population figure of 17,140. The 2022 census (undertaken on 3 April 2022) determined that Clonmel had a population of 18,369, making it the 27th largest urban area in Ireland. The population was about 12,400 in 1985.

==Media==

===Radio===
Tipp FM is a local radio station for the county of Tipperary. It has its main office in Clonmel. In 2019, Tippfm had over 69,000 listeners tuning in every week, representing a market share to 35%. It broadcasts on FM, on 95.3, 97.1, 103.3 and 103.9. The Clonmel transmitter broadcasts on 97.1 MHz.

===Print===
Clonmel is home to several newspapers. These include &quot;The Nationalist&quot;, founded in 1890, which is a broadsheet newspaper that appears weekly. It covers both Clonmel town and South Tipperary and was formed to represent the views of the nationalist community in Tipperary. This led to the first editor being jailed under the Coercion Act on charges that he had intimidated a cattle dealer for taking a farm from which tenants had been evicted. It has been run by Johnston Press since 2014.

Also owned by Johnston Press is &quot;South Tipp Today&quot;, a free tabloid newspaper founded in 1995. It is delivered door-to-door in some areas, and available in local shops across South Tipperary.

&quot;The Sporting Press&quot;, also published and printed in Clonmel, covers news related to the greyhound community in Ireland. As of 2007, it had a circulation of approximately 7,500.

The &quot;Tipperary Free Press&quot; was established in 1826 by the future first Catholic Lord Mayor of Clonmel, John Hackett. It had a circulation of 45,650 in 1829 and supported &quot;liberal&quot; causes. It supported Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s movement for Catholic emancipation. Hackett was sued for libel on several occasions for his caricatures of political rivals. Printed on O&#x27;Connell Street bi-weekly, it circulated in counties Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick. In its later years, it assumed a Catholic-Whig political leaning and ceased printing in 1880 when it was replaced by the &quot;Tipperary Independent&quot; (1880–1892).

== Culture ==

=== Museums and galleries ===

The Tipperary Museum of Hidden History  tells the history of County Tipperary from the Stone Age to the present. It is also host to several special exhibitions each year. It was the first custom-built county museum in Ireland.

The Main Guard was a civic building until 1810 when it was converted to shops. During a one restoration, some of its sandstone columns were found to have been &#x27;reclaimed&#x27; from the Medieval ruins of the Cistercian Inislounaght Abbey at Marlfield. It was used in the past as a Tholsel or office to collect tolls, duties and customs dues, a place for civic gatherings and as a court. It now houses an exhibition showing the historic development of Clonmel, including a model of the town as it appeared in the 13th century.

The South Tipperary Arts Centre opened in 1996. As well as presenting a range of visual arts exhibitions in the main gallery space, the centre also host events such as music, performance, art classes, poetry readings and dance. The centre has an upstairs studio which is used for short term exhibitions and screenings, as well as for a variety of classes and workshops.

=== Theatre and cinema ===
The White Memorial Theatre building is a former Wesleyan/Methodist Chapel and was designed and built by local architect William Tinsley in 1843. The building was purchased in 1975 by St. Mary&#x27;s Choral Society and named after society founder Professor James A White. In addition to hosting performances, the building hosts shows by the Stage Craft Youth Theatre group.

Clonmel&#x27;s Stagecraft Youth Theatre was founded in 1998. It provides training for young actors in several aspects of theatre practice. Stagecraft is one of Ireland&#x27;s largest youth theatres and is affiliated with NAYD. In 2011, a 45-seat studio theatre, known as &quot;The Hub&quot;, was opened in Albert Street. The Hub is home to Stagecraft.

The IMC, with five screens and located on Kickham Street, is the town&#x27;s only remaining cinema. Other cinemas formerly operated in the town including the Ritz, which opened in 1940 and was located on the site of the present Credit Union. The first cinema in the town opened in January 1913 as the Clonmel Cinema Theatre. Later renamed the Clonmel Electric Picture Palace, it was located at the rear of No. 35 Gladstone Street. It was soon followed by John Magner&#x27;s Theatre at the Mall, which burned to the ground in 1919, to be re-built in 1921 with an increased capacity of over a thousand seats. It was eventually named the Regal Theatre and remodelled as an 850-seat theatre, which finally closed in 2001. It was in the Regal Theatre where the tenor Frank Patterson made his stage debut. The Oisin, in O&#x27;Connell Street, was of a similar scale and was also built in 1921. It was destroyed in a fire in 1965.

=== Festivals ===
For nine days from the first weekend of July, the town hosts the annual Clonmel Junction Festival. It consists of a mix of street theatre, rock, traditional and world music. Children from local schools and community groups have previously been invited to participate with support from local artists.

Originally a brass band, it later developed as a brass and reed band, which included concert, marching and field show performances. The band also has a colour guard section. The band has been crowned IMBA (Irish Marching Bands Association) champions on a number of occasions.

Clonmel has hosted the Irish traditional music festival, the Fleadh Cheoil, on five occasions from 1992 to 1994 inclusive, and again in 2003 and 2004.

One of the better-known songs concerning Clonmel is &quot;The Gaol of Cluain Meala&quot;, a translation from the turn of the 19th century by a Cork man, Jeremiah Joseph Callanan, of the traditional Irish-language song &quot;Príosún Chluain Meala&quot;. It was revived by the balladeer Luke Kelly in the 1960s. The narrator in the Irish republican song &quot;Galtee Mountain Boy&quot; farewells Clonmel in the song. It was written by Patsy Halloran from Clonmel.

Music venues in Clonmel include The Piper Inn, which previously hosted a show by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy.

===Clonmel in literature===

Raymond Chandler&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; features Rusty Regan as a main character: &quot;A big curly-headed Irishman from Clonmel, with sad eyes and a smile as wide as Wilshire Boulevard.&quot;

Charles Kickham&#x27;s 1873 novel &quot;Knocknagow&quot; had two main characters modelled on Clonmel locals. These were his cousins, Dr T.J. Crean Sr. as &quot;Arthur O&#x27;Conner&quot; and his wife Clara Crean (née Kickham) as &quot;&quot;Mary Kearney&quot;,&quot; who both lived on Queen Street at the time.

<doc id="523703" wikidata="Q1897973" url="?curid=523703" title="Myriagon">
<text>In geometry, a myriagon or 10000-gon is a polygon with 10000 sides. Several philosophers have used the regular myriagon to illustrate issues regarding thought.

== Regular myriagon==
A regular myriagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {10,000} and can be constructed as a truncated 5000-gon, t{5000}, or a twice-truncated 2500-gon, tt{2500}, or a thrice-truncated 1250-gon, ttt{1250}, or a four-fold-truncated 625-gon, tttt{625}.

The measure of each internal angle in a regular myriagon is 179.964°. The area of a regular myriagon with sides of length &quot;a&quot; is given by
:formula_1

The result differs from the area of its circumscribed circle by up to 40 parts per billion.

Because 10,000 = 24 × 54, the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular myriagon is not a constructible polygon. Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes, nor a product of powers of two and three.

== Symmetry==
The &quot;regular myriagon&quot; has Dih10000 dihedral symmetry, order 20000, represented by 10000 lines of reflection. Dih10000 has 24 dihedral subgroups: (Dih5000, Dih2500, Dih1250, Dih625), (Dih2000, Dih1000, Dih500, Dih250, Dih125), (Dih400, Dih200, Dih100, Dih50, Dih25), (Dih80, Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5), and (Dih16, Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, Dih1). It also has 25 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z10000, Z5000, Z2500, Z1250, Z625), (Z2000, Z1000, Z500, Z250, Z125), (Z400, Z200, Z100, Z50, Z25), (Z80, Z40, Z20, Z10), and (Z16, Z8, Z4, Z2, Z1), with Z&quot;n&quot; representing &quot;π&quot;/&quot;n&quot; radian rotational symmetry.

John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter. r20000 represents full symmetry, and a1 labels no symmetry. He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. 

These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedom in defining irregular myriagons. Only the g10000 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

==Myriagram==
A myriagram is a 10,000-sided star polygon. There are 1999 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols of the form {10000/&quot;n&quot;}, where &quot;n&quot; is an integer between 2 and 5,000 that is coprime to 10,000. There are also 3000 regular star figures in the remaining cases.

==In popular culture==
In the novella &quot;Flatland&quot;, the Chief Circle is assumed to have ten thousand sides, making him a myriagon.

<text>Richard Bellingham (c. 1592 – 7 December 1672) was a colonial magistrate, lawyer, and several-time governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the last surviving signatory of the colonial charter at his death. A wealthy lawyer in Lincolnshire prior to his departure for the New World in 1634, he was a liberal political opponent of the moderate John Winthrop, arguing for expansive views on suffrage and lawmaking, but also religiously somewhat conservative, opposing (at times quite harshly) the efforts of Quakers and Baptists to settle in the colony. He was one of the architects of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, a document embodying many sentiments also found in the United States Bill of Rights.

Although he was generally in the minority during his early years in the colony, he served ten years as colonial governor, most of them during the delicate years of the English Restoration, when King Charles II scrutinized the behavior of the colonial governments. Bellingham notably refused a direct order from the king to appear in England, an action that may have contributed to the eventual revocation of the colonial charter in 1684.

He was twice married. He died in 1672, leaving an estate in present-day Chelsea, Massachusetts, and a large house in Boston. The estate became embroiled in legal action lasting more than 100 years after his will was challenged by his son and eventually set aside. Bellingham is immortalized in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The New England Tragedies&quot;, both of which fictionalize events from colonial days.

==Early life==

Richard Bellingham, the son of William Bellingham and Frances Amcotts, was born in Lincolnshire, England, in about 1592. The family was apparently well to do; they resided in a manor at Bromby Wood near Scunthorpe. He studied law at Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating on 1 December 1609. In 1625 he was elected Recorder (the highest community legal post) of Boston, a position he held until 1633. He represented Boston as a member of Parliament in 1628 and 1629. He was first married to Elizabeth Backhouse of Swallowfield, Berkshire, with whom he had a number of children, although only their son Samuel survived to adulthood.

In 1628 he became an investor in the Massachusetts Bay Company, and was one of the signers of the land grant issued to it by the Plymouth Council for New England. His name also appears on the royal charter issued for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629. In 1633 he resigned as recorder of Boston and began selling off his properties. The next year he sailed for the New World with his wife and son; Elizabeth died not long after their arrival in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Massachusetts Bay Colony==

Bellingham immediately assumed a prominent role in the colony, serving on the committee that oversaw the affairs of Boston (a precursor to the board of selectmen). In this role he participated in the division of community lands that included the establishment of Boston Common. Not long after his arrival, he purchased the ferry service between Boston and Winnessimmett (present-day Chelsea) from Samuel Maverick, along with tracts of land that encompass much of Chelsea. In addition to his mansion house in Boston, he also established a country home near the ferry in Winnessimmett. A house he built in 1659 still stands in Chelsea, and is known as the Bellingham-Cary House.

For many years he was elected to the colony&#x27;s council of assistants, which advised the governor on legislative matters and served as a judicial body, and he also served several terms as colonial treasurer. He was first elected deputy governor of the colony in 1635, at a time when the dominant John Winthrop was out of favor, and was elected to the post again in 1640. In 1637, during the Antinomian Controversy, he was one of the magistrates that sat during the trial of Anne Hutchinson, and voted for her to be banished from the colony. According to historian Francis Bremer, Bellingham was somewhat brash and antagonistic, and he and Winthrop repeatedly clashed on political matters. During these early years Bellingham was chosen to be on the first board of overseers of Harvard College. He also contributed to the development of the colony&#x27;s first legal code, known as the Massachusetts Body of Liberties. This work was opposed and repeatedly stalled by Winthrop, who favored a common law approach to legislation.

In 1641 Bellingham was elected governor for the first time, running against Winthrop. The Body of Liberties was formally adopted during his term. However, he served for just one year, and was replaced by Winthrop in 1642. Bellingham&#x27;s defeat may have been caused in part by the scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage. A friend who was a guest in his house had been courting Penelope Pelham, a young woman of twenty. According to Winthrop, Bellingham, now 50 and a widower, won her heart, and, without waiting for the formalities of the banns of marriage, officiated at his own wedding. When the issue came before the colonial magistrates, Bellingham (as the governor and chief magistrate) refused to step down from the bench to face the charges, thus bringing the matter to a somewhat awkward end. Bellingham&#x27;s term in office was characterized by Winthrop as extremely difficult: &quot;The General Court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of Bellingham&#x27;s unfriendliness to some other magistrates. He set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings, which did much to retard business&quot;.
In the 1640s constitutional issues concerning the power of the assistants arose. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow&#x27;s errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court&#x27;s decision, sparking the controversy. John Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because &quot;a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.&quot; Bellingham was one of only two assistants (the other was Richard Saltonstall) who opposed the final decision that the assistants&#x27; veto should stand. Bellingham and Saltonstall were often in a minority that opposed the more conservative views of Winthrop and Thomas Dudley. In 1648 Bellingham sat on a committee established to demonstrate that the colony&#x27;s legal codes were not &quot;repugnant to the laws of England&quot;, as called for by the colonial charter.

In 1650, when Bellingham was an assistant, he concurred in the judicial decision banning William Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption&quot;, which expressed views many Puritans considered heretical. Bellingham was again elected governor in 1654, and again in May 1665 after the death of Governor John Endecott. He was thereafter annually re-elected to the post until his death, ultimately serving a total of ten years as governor and thirteen as deputy governor. While he was deputy to Endecott in 1656, a boat carrying several Quakers arrived in Boston. Since Endecott was in Salem at the time, Bellingham directed the government&#x27;s reaction to their arrival. Because Quakerism was anathema to the Puritans, the Quakers were confined to the ship, their belongings were searched, and books promoting their religion were destroyed. After five weeks of captivity, they were sent back to England. During Endecott&#x27;s administration the penalties for Quakers defying banishment from the colony were made progressively harsher, until they included the imposition of the death penalty for repeat offenders. Under these laws, four Quakers were put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. Quaker historians have also been harsh in their assessments of Bellingham. After Massachusetts authorities agreed that the death penalty did not work (it had long term negative consequences, feeding perceptions of Massachusetts intransigence), the law was modified to reduce the penalties to branding and whipping.

==English Restoration==

The 1640s and 1650s in England were a time of great turmoil. The English Civil War led to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England and eventually the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. In this period, Massachusetts was generally sympathetic to Cromwell and the Parliamentary cause. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, all of the colonies, and Massachusetts in particular, came under his scrutiny. In 1661 he issued a &quot;mandamus&quot; forbidding further persecution of the Quakers. He also requested specific changes to be made to Massachusetts laws to increase suffrage and tolerance for other Protestant religious practices, actions that were resisted or ignored during the Endecott administration. Charles finally sent royal commissioners to New England in 1664 to enforce his demands, but Massachusetts, of all the New England colonies, was the most recalcitrant, refusing all of the substantive demands or enacting changes that only superficially addressed the issues.
The reaction by Charles to this was to issue an order in 1666 demanding that Bellingham, since he was then governor, and William Hathorne, the speaker of the general court, travel to England to answer for the colony&#x27;s behavior. The issue of how to answer this demand divided the colony, with petitions from a cross-section of the colony&#x27;s population calling for the magistrates to obey the king&#x27;s demand. The debate also introduced a long-term rift in the council of assistants between hardliners wanting to resist the king&#x27;s demands at all costs and moderates who thought the king&#x27;s demands should be accommodated. Bellingham sided with the hardliners and the decision was reached to send the king a letter. The letter questioned whether the request actually originated with the king, protested that the colony was loyal to him, and claimed the magistrates had already explained fully why they were unable to comply with the king&#x27;s demands. The magistrates further pacified the angered sovereign by sending over a ship full of masts as a gift (New England was a valuable source of timber for the Royal Navy). Distracted by the war with the Dutch and domestic politics, Charles did not pursue the issue further until after Bellingham&#x27;s death, though for numerous reasons the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter was finally voided in 1684.

==Death and legacy==

Richard Bellingham died on 7 December 1672. He was the last surviving signer of the colonial charter, and was buried in Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. He had a son Samuel from his first marriage and a second wife Penelope, who outlived him by 30 years. His landholdings at Winnessimmett became tied up in legal action lasting more than 100 years, and involved court and procedural decisions on both sides of the Atlantic to resolve. Under the terms of his will, some of his properties in Winnessimmett were set aside for religious uses. His son challenged the will, which was eventually set aside. The litigation continued, carried on by his heirs and succeeding owners and occupants of the properties, and was finally concluded in 1785. The town of Bellingham, Massachusetts is named in his honor, and a number of features in Chelsea, including a square, a street, and a hill, bear the name Bellingham.
Bellingham was immortalized as a fictional character in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, as the brother of Ann Hibbins, a woman who was executed (in real life in 1656, as well as in the book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham&#x27;s sister—Hawthorne&#x27;s formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage&#x27;s 1825 edition of John Winthrop&#x27;s journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins&#x27; second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham&#x27;s sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The New England Tragedies&quot;, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.

<doc id="523712" wikidata="Q3160881" url="?curid=523712" title="James A. Johnson (businessman)">
<text>James A. Johnson (December 24, 1943October 18, 2020) was an American businessman, Democratic Party political figure, and chairman and chief executive officer of Fannie Mae. He was the campaign chairman for Walter Mondale&#x27;s unsuccessful 1984 presidential bid and chaired the vice presidential selection committee for the presidential campaign of John Kerry. He briefly led the vice-presidential selection process for the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama.

Before working for Fannie Mae, Johnson co-founded the private consulting firm Public Strategies with diplomat Richard Holbrooke. They sold the company to Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1985, after which Johnson served as a managing director at Lehman Brothers. After leading Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, Johnson became a board member of the investment bank Goldman Sachs as well as several other companies including Target Corporation and UnitedHealth Group. He was also chairman of both the Kennedy Center for the Arts and the Brookings Institution.

==Early life and education==
Johnson was born on December 24, 1943, in Benson, Minnesota. He was the son of Adeline, a schoolteacher, and Alfred I. Johnson, who was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1941 to 1958, and served as speaker of the house in 1955 and 1957.

At the University of Minnesota, Johnson was student body president and graduated with a B.A. in political science in 1966, and a Master of Public Affairs degree from the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1968.

==Career==
While a student at the University of Minnesota, Johnson began his political career as a volunteer on the 1968 presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy. He was later a faculty member at Princeton University.

In the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Johnson started as the national campaign coordinator for Senator Edmund Muskie, whose primary campaign came to an end despite early victories in Iowa and Illinois. From 1973 to 1976, Johnson served as director of public affairs at the Dayton-Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation). During this period, Johnson also worked for Senators George McGovern and Walter Mondale. In 1974, Mondale considered a run in the 1976 presidential primaries with an exploratory committee which Johnson helped create. In 1976, he was deputy director of Mondale&#x27;s vice-presidential campaign and was executive assistant to the Vice President during the entire Carter Administration. 

In 1981, Johnson co-founded Public Strategies, a private consulting firm, with diplomat Richard Holbrooke. During that time, he was the campaign manager for Walter Mondale&#x27;s unsuccessful 1984 presidential bid. After selling Public Strategies to Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1985, Johnson was a managing director at Lehman Brothers from 1985 to 1990.

In 1990, Johnson became vice chairman of Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, a United States government-sponsored enterprise and publicly traded company. In 1991, he was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of Fannie Mae, a position he held until 1998. In 1996 Johnson published a book, &quot;Showing America a New Way Home&quot;.

An Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) report from September 2004 found that, during Johnson&#x27;s tenure as CEO, Fannie Mae had improperly deferred $200 million in expenses. This enabled top executives, including Johnson and his successor, Franklin Raines, to receive substantial bonuses in 1998. A 2006 OFHEO report found that Fannie Mae had substantially under-reported Johnson&#x27;s compensation. Originally reported as $6–7 million, Johnson actually received approximately $21 million.

In the 2011 book &quot;Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon&quot;, authors Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner wrote that Johnson was one of the key figures responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Morgenson described him in an NPR interview as &quot;corporate America&#x27;s founding father of regulation manipulation&quot;. Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2012, &quot;In fairness to Mr. Johnson, the vast majority of losses racked up by Fannie were the results of loans bought after he departed.&quot;

Johnson was one of the first outside directors and the longest-serving board member of the investment bank Goldman Sachs. From 1999, when the company went public, until May 2018, he served as chairman of the compensation committee at Goldman Sachs. He also served on the board of Forestar Group, Gannett Company, Inc., KB Home, Target Corporation, Temple-Inland, and UnitedHealth Group. Johnson was also the vice chairman of the private banking firm Perseus.

Johnson chaired the vice presidential selection committee for the unsuccessful 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry. There was speculation that, had Kerry won, Johnson might have been named Kerry&#x27;s chief of staff, or Secretary of the Treasury.

On June 4, 2008, Barack Obama announced the formation of a three-person committee to vet vice presidential candidates, including Johnson, Caroline Kennedy, and Eric Holder. However, Johnson soon became a source of controversy when it was reported that he had received $7 million in cut-rate mortgage loans directly from Angelo Mozilo, the CEO of Countrywide Financial, a company implicated in the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. Johnson resigned from the vice presidential search committee on June 11, 2008, stating that he had done nothing wrong but did not want to distract attention from Obama&#x27;s &quot;historical effort&quot;. He continued to assist in efforts to recruit former Hillary Clinton supporters to the Obama campaign. On September 19, 2008, the John McCain campaign released an ad critical of Obama for his connections to Johnson and for appointing him to the vice presidential search committee.

==Other memberships==
Johnson has served as chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Arts (1996–2004) where he created and endowed the center&#x27;s Millennium Stage. He was also chairman of the Brookings Institution (1994–2003) and continued thereafter to serve on the advisory council of the Brookings Institution&#x27;s Hamilton Project. Since 2011, he has been chairman of the advisory council for the Stanford University Center on Longevity. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Friends of Bilderberg, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Johnson was also a member of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group and participated in all of their conferences since 1998 except in 1999 and 2004.

==Honors and accolades==
In 1994, Johnson received the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for his contributions to the U.S.&#x27;s building heritage during his tenure at Fannie Mae. He was also named as a Washingtonian of the Year by &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine in 1998.

Johnson received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Colby College in 1997, an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Howard University in 1999, and Doctor of Laws from Skidmore College in 2002 and the University of Minnesota in 2006.

==Personal life==
Johnson&#x27;s first marriage was to Katherine Marshall. After they divorced, he married Maxine Isaacs, who served as press secretary for Mondale&#x27;s 1984 election campaign. Together, they had a son (Alfred). They separated in 2010 and subsequently divorced. He married Heather Muir Kirby, a managing director at Deutsche Bank, in 2016.

Johnson&#x27;s son, Alfred Johnson, is currently serving as Deputy Chief of Staff in the Department of the Treasury. He previously served in the Obama Administration, working as an aide to Rahm Emanuel. 

Johnson died on October 18, 2020, at his home in Washington, D.C., at age 76; he had suffered from a neurological condition in the time leading up to his death.

<text>A social insurance number (SIN) ( (NAS)) is a number issued in Canada to administer various government programs. The SIN was created in 1964 to serve as a client account number in the administration of the Canada Pension Plan and Canada&#x27;s varied employment insurance programs. In 1967, Revenue Canada (now the Canada Revenue Agency) started using the SIN for tax reporting purposes. SINs are issued by Employment and Social Development Canada (previously Human Resources Development Canada).

The SIN is formatted as three groups of three digits (e.g., 123-456-789).

The top of the card has changed over the years as the departments that are responsible for the card have changed:

* Manpower and Immigration
* Employment and Immigration Canada
* Human Resources Development Canada
* Government of Canada

The 2012 Canadian federal budget contained provisions to phase out the Social Insurance Number cards because they lacked modern security features and could be used for identity theft. As of 31 March 2014, Service Canada no longer issues plastic SIN cards. Instead, an individual will receive a paper &quot;Confirmation of SIN&quot; letter.

==Functionality==
Through functionality creep, the SIN has become a national identification number, in much the same way that the Social Security number has in the United States. However, unlike in the US, in Canada there are specific legislated purposes for which a SIN can be requested. It is not an identity document.

Unless an organization can demonstrate that the reason it is requesting an individual&#x27;s SIN is specifically permitted by law, or that no alternative identifiers would suffice to complete the transaction, it cannot deny or refuse a product or service on the grounds of a refusal to provide a SIN. Examples of organizations that legitimately require a SIN include employers, financial institutions that provide interest on deposits, and federal government agencies. Giving a SIN when applying for consumer credit, such as buying a car or electronics, or allowing it to be used as a general purpose identification number, such as by a cable company, is strongly discouraged.

The Canadian military used the SIN as a form of unique identifier from the 1960s until the 1980s, when service numbers were reintroduced. Military identification, including ID cards and identity discs were marked with the SIN during this period.

==Temporary SINs==
Social Insurance Numbers that begin with the number &quot;9&quot; are issued to temporary residents who are not Canadian citizens or Canadian permanent residents (e.g., foreign students, individuals on work visas). Often, these individuals must have an employment authorization in order to work in Canada. SINs beginning with a &quot;9&quot; are different from SINs assigned to citizens and permanent residents, because they have an expiry date (which usually coincides with the expiration of the holder&#x27;s work permit). These SINs are invalid unless there is an expiry date listed on the card and the date has not passed.

== Permanent resident SINs ==
* Issued by the federal government to each Canadian citizen or permanent resident;
* The SIN is unique and assigned to only one citizen

==Validation==

Social Insurance Numbers can be validated through a simple check digit process called the Luhn algorithm.

 046 454 286 &lt;--- A fictitious, but valid, SIN.
 121 212 121 &lt;--- Multiply every second digit by 2.

The result of the multiplication is:

 0 8 6 8 5 8 2 16 6

Then, add all of the digits together (note that 16 is summed as the individual digits 1+6):

 0 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 2 + 1+6 + 6 = 50

If the SIN is valid, this number will be evenly divisible by 10.

==Geography==

The first digit of a SIN usually identifies the province in which it was registered, as listed below. However, the government has found it necessary in the past to supply certain regions with SINs assigned to other regions. 

:1: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador; new Ontario SINs are now being issued with the 1 series
:2–3: Quebec
:4–5: Ontario (excluding Northwestern Ontario), and overseas forces
:6: Northwestern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut
:7: British Columbia, Yukon, and new business numbers.
:8: Used exclusively for the BN (Business Number) assigned to business owners and corporations. Due to the limited number of BNs available, new BNs can start with a 7.
:9: Temporary resident
:0: CRA-assigned individual tax numbers, temporary tax numbers or adoption tax numbers

<text>Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (13 January 1674 – 17 June 1762) was a French poet and tragedian.

He is sometimes known as Crébillon or  (Crébillon the Tragic) to distinguish him from his son Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (Crébillon the Gay).

==Biography==
Crébillon was born in Dijon, where his father, Melchior Jolyot, was notary-royal. Having been educated at the Jesuit school in the town, and afterwards at the Collège Mazarin. He became an advocate, and was placed in the office of a lawyer named Prieur at Paris. With the encouragement of his master, son of an old friend of Scarron&#x27;s, he produced a &quot;Mort des enfants de Brutus&quot;, which was never produced on the stage.

In 1705 he succeeded with &quot;Idoménée&quot;; in 1707 his &quot;Atrée et Thyeste&quot; was repeatedly acted at court; &quot;Electre&quot; appeared in 1709; and in 1711 he produced his finest play, &quot;Rhadamiste et Zénobie&quot;, considered as his masterpiece despite a complicated and over-involved plot. But his &quot;Xerxes&quot; (1714) was only performed once and his &quot;Sémiramis&quot; (1717) was an absolute failure.

In 1707 Crébillon had married a penniless girl, who died, leaving him two young children. His father had also died, insolvent. In three years at court he had gained nothing and aroused considerable envy. Oppressed with melancholy, he moved to a garret, where he surrounded himself with dogs, cats and birds, which he had befriended; he became utterly careless of cleanliness or food, and sought comfort only in smoking.

He returned to the stage in 1726 with a successful play, &quot;Pyrrhus.&quot; In 1731, despite his long seclusion, he was elected to the Académie française; in 1735 he was appointed royal censor; and in 1745 Madame de Pompadour presented him with a pension of 1000 francs and a post in the royal library. In 1748 his &quot;Catilina&quot; was performed with great success at court; and in 1754, aged eighty, he presented his last tragedy, &quot;Le Triumvirat&quot;. His only son Claude was also an author.

Crébillon was considered by many to be superior to Voltaire as a tragic poet. The spirit of rivalry induced Voltaire to take the subjects of no less than five of Crébillon&#x27;s tragedies (&quot;Semiramis&quot;, &quot;Electre&quot;, &quot;Catilina&quot;, &quot;Le Triumviral&quot; and &quot;Ahreeas&quot;) as his own. The so-called &quot;Éloge de Crébillon&quot; (1762; the title meant ironically), which appeared in the year of the poet&#x27;s death, was generally attributed to Voltaire, though he strenuously denied the authorship.

There are numerous editions of his works, among which may be noticed: &quot;Œuvres&quot; (1772), with preface and &quot;éloge&quot;, by Joseph de La Porte; &quot;Œuvres&quot; (1828), containing D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Éloge de Crébillon&quot; (1775); and &quot;Théâtre complet&quot; (1885), with a notice by Auguste Vito. A complete bibliography is given by Maurice Dutrait in his &quot;Étude sur la vie et le théâtre de Crébillon&quot; (1895).

Edgar Allan Poe took lines from Crébillon&#x27;s &quot;Atrée&quot; as the last lines and obscure ending of his tale &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;.

<text>Boogie Box High was an English pop musical project headed by Andros Georgiou in the late 1980s that featured a range of collaborators, including George Michael, guitarist Nick Heyward (of Haircut One Hundred), keyboardist Mick Talbot (of the Style Council), guitarist–songwriter David Austin, bassist Deon Estus, and others.

==Overview==
Boogie Box High&#x27;s first single was a cover version of &quot;Jive Talkin&quot;, originally a top ten hit for the Bee Gees in 1975, featuring Michael on lead vocals. Released in June 1987, the cover reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Outrageous&quot;, Boogie Box High&#x27;s only LP, was released in 1989. It was released in the United States via SBK Records. The album included the previous two singles, &quot;Jive Talkin&quot; and &quot;Gave It All Away&quot;, as well as a new released titled &quot;Nervous&quot;. The latter single failed to garner any chart success.

Michael&#x27;s contributions to the album were two previously unreleased songs he had written for Wham!&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fantastic&quot;, &quot;Golden Soul&quot; and &quot;Soul Boy&quot;. Once again, Michael was not credited for any of this.

<doc id="523726" wikidata="Q7366732" url="?curid=523726" title="Roper (band)">
<text>Roper was a Christian pop-punk band formed in Denver, Colorado. The band consisted of Reese Roper (lead singer of Five Iron Frenzy) on lead vocals, Jonathan Byrnside on lead guitar, Jonathan Till on bass, Matt Emmett on rhythm guitar, and Nick White on drums.

==Background ==

Guerilla Rodeo was a short-lived project founded by Reese Roper, meant to follow his prior band Five Iron Frenzy. In addition to vocalist Reese Roper, the band was formed by fellow Five Iron member Sonnie Johnston (guitar), Ethan Luck (guitar), John Warne (bass, background vocals), and Josh Abbott (drums). The project yielded only a three-track EP, &quot;Ride, Rope and Destroy&quot;, released in 2004. It has been confirmed by both Ethan Luck and Reese Roper that there never was a fourth, unreleased song recorded for the EP. Reese Roper often compared the sound of the band to Letters to Cleo. Their name was a play on the Rage Against the Machine single &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot;.

When the Guerilla Rodeo project came to an end, Reese reformed the band under his own name, Roper. Roper&#x27;s full-length album, &quot;Brace Yourself for the Mediocre&quot;, was produced before the band was officially together and released on Five Minute Walk Records. All songs on the album with the exception of &quot;Day of Pigs&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Still The One&quot; were written by Reese Roper, Masaki Liu, and Ethan Luck. Because of the incomplete state of the band at the time of the album&#x27;s release, the only official member appearing on the CD is Reese Roper. As a result, the album features many additional musicians such as Frank Lenz (drums), Elijah Thomson (bass), Phil Bennett (organ), Bob Schiveley (guitar), Masaki Liu (guitar), Jason White (additional drums), Ethan Luck (guitar), and many additional vocalists. Some of the songs on the album were originally written for Guerilla Rodeo. One of the online forums spawned by this group is the Roper Board in which many fans of both Roper and Reese&#x27;s previous band Five Iron Frenzy congregate.

Roper issued a statement regarding the status of the band in 2006:
In 2009 Reese Roper told &quot;HM&quot; that the probability of making another album was &quot;somewhere around 3%.&quot; The Roper project sold close to 30,000 albums in total, about the same as Brave Saint Saturn and other Five Iron related side projects. He also stated that, in retrospect, the project was &quot;doomed from the beginning,&quot; but that musically it was the highlight of his career.

<text>Maniwaki is a town in the province of Quebec, Canada. It is situated north of Ottawa, Ontario, on the Gatineau River, at the crossroads of Route 105 and Route 107, near Route 117 (Trans-Canada Highway). The town is the administrative centre for La Vallée-de-la-Gatineau Regional County Municipality.

== History ==
The history of Maniwaki is closely linked to that of the adjacent Kitigan Zibi Reserve, because the Town of Maniwaki was developed on land that was originally part of this reserve. Its municipal lands were included in historical land claims by Kitigan Zibi; some of which were settled as recently as 2007.

In the first half of the nineteenth century, Algonquins of the mission at Lake of Two Mountains, under the leadership of Chief Pakinawatik, came to the area of the Désert River. Shortly after, in 1832, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company followed them and installed a trading post at the confluence of the Désert and Gatineau rivers. A decade later, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate established the mission of Notre-Dame-du-Desert and, from 1849, they demanded of the authorities the demarcation of a township in order to establish a reserve for the Algonquins. The township limits were drawn in 1850 and the settlement was given the name of Maniwaki by the Oblates at this time (Algonquin for &quot;Mary&#x27;s Land&quot;). Soon after, wood merchants, farmers, trade workers, businessmen and professionals, drawn by the forest&#x27;s wealth, came to live in Maniwaki.

Ottawa was linked to Maniwaki by a branch line of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, a distance of 82.3 miles. After crossing the Ottawa River, there were stations were at Hull, Wakefield, Low, Kazabazua and Gracefield before reaching Maniwaki. It was opened in stages between 1893 and 1902. Passenger services were discontinued in 1964. The line was totally abandoned in 1986.
In 1851, the Oblats founded the L&#x27;Assomption-de-Maniwaki parish. Forestry took root and became the livelihood of many settlers in the region. Irish, French and Algonquins, the three traditional cultures of the Gatineau Valley, contributed to the development of the town and lived side by side in harmony. Maniwaki was officially founded in 1851 and became a township municipality in 1904. It obtained the status of &quot;village&quot; in 1930, and status of &quot;Ville&quot; in 1957.

At the end of World War I, the region, like everywhere in Quebec, indeed like in most of the world, was hit by an epidemic of the Spanish influenza. In less than two weeks, some twenty deaths were related to this sickness. Scared, people refused to go outdoors, and for the first time in its history, a Sunday passed without any mass being celebrated at the Assumption church.

The flood of 1974 is an event remembered by the local population. On May 14 of that year, the waters of the Gatineau river and those of the Désert river overflowed. The water rose at the alarming rate of 3 to 6 inches an hour. Over 1,000 residences in the Maniwaki area were flooded and approximately 3,000 people had to be evacuated. Although no one was injured, damages reached many millions of dollars.

Since 1974, no other major calamity has occurred. The area continues prospering every year in two predominant fields, namely forestry and tourism.

== Geography and climate ==
Maniwaki has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Maniwaki is . The average annual rainfall is with October as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Maniwaki was on 1 August 1975; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 11 January 1954.

== Disappearance of Maisy Odjick and Shannon Alexander ==

On September 6, 2008, the town of Maniwaki was brought into the international spotlight with the disappearance of Maisy Odjick and Shannon Alexander from the Kitigan Zibi Nation. Search and Rescue Global One was invited to the community by the chief and council. Two separate searches were conducted, both unsuccessful. Since their disappearance, the Quebec police, RCMP and the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg police have carried out several investigations, but it was not possible to move the case forward.

<doc id="523737" wikidata="Q954226" url="?curid=523737" title="Egg incubation">
<text>Egg incubation is the process by which an egg, of oviparous (egg-laying) animals, develops an embryo within the egg, after the egg&#x27;s formation and ovipositional release. Egg incubation is done under favorable environmental conditions, possibly by brooding and hatching the egg.

Multiple and various factors are vital to the incubation of various species of animal. In many species of reptile for example, no fixed temperature is necessary, but the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds in contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but in many species a constant and particular temperature is necessary for successful incubation. Especially in poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called brooding. The action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called broodiness, and most egg-laying breeds of poultry have had this behavior selectively bred out of them to increase production.

==Avian incubation==
A wide range of incubation habits is displayed among birds. In warm-blooded species such as bird species generally, body heat from the brooding patch of the brooding parent provides the constant temperature. Several groups, notably the megapodes, instead use heat generated from rotting vegetable material, effectively creating a giant compost heap, while crab plovers make partial use of heat from the sun. The Namaqua sandgrouse of the deserts of southern Africa, needing to keep its eggs cool during the heat of the day, stands over them drooping its wings to shade them. The humidity is also critical, because if the air is too dry the egg will lose too much water to the atmosphere, which can make hatching difficult or impossible. As incubation proceeds, an egg will normally become lighter, and the air space within the egg will normally become larger, owing to evaporation from the egg. During incubation, the inner layers of the shell are dissolved by their acidic environment and the calcium carbonate that had been part of the shell is incorporated into the skeleton of the foetus.

Experiments with great tits show that females compensate for the potential effects of differential heating by moving the eggs homogeneously within the clutch.

In the species that incubate, the work is divided differently between the sexes. Possibly the most common pattern is that the female does all the incubation, as in the Atlantic canary and the Indian robin, or most of it, as is typical of falcons. In some species, such as the whooping crane, the male and the female take turns incubating the egg. In others, such as the cassowaries, only the male incubates. The male mountain plover incubates the female&#x27;s first clutch, but if she lays a second, she incubates it herself. In hoatzins, some birds (mostly males) help their parents incubate later broods.

The incubation period, the time from the start of uninterrupted incubation to the emergence of the young, varies from 11 days (some small passerines and the black-billed and yellow-billed cuckoos) to 85 days (the wandering albatross and the brown kiwi). In these latter, the incubation is interrupted; the longest uninterrupted period is 64 to 67 days in the emperor penguin. In general smaller birds tend to hatch faster, but there are exceptions, and cavity nesting birds tend to have longer incubation periods. It can be an energetically demanding process, with adult albatrosses losing as much as 83 g of body weight a day. Megapode eggs take from 49 to 90 days depending on the mound and ambient temperature. Even in other birds, ambient temperatures can lead to variation in incubation period. Normally the egg is incubated outside the body. However, in one recorded case, the egg incubation occurred entirely within a chicken. The chick hatched inside and emerged from its mother without the shell, leading to internal wounds that killed the mother hen.

Embryo development remains suspended until the onset of incubation. The freshly laid eggs of domestic fowl, ostrich, and several other species can be stored for about two weeks when maintained under 5 °C. Extended periods of suspension have been observed in some marine birds. Some species begin incubation with the first egg, causing the young to hatch at different times; others begin after laying the second egg, so that the third chick will be smaller and more vulnerable to food shortages. Some start to incubate after the last egg of the clutch, causing the young to hatch simultaneously.

Incubation periods for birds:

==Mammalian incubation==
The only living mammals that lay eggs are echidnas and platypuses. In the latter, the eggs develop &quot;in utero&quot; for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external incubation (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). After laying her eggs, the female curls around them. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the embryo has no functional organs and relies on the yolk sac for sustenance. The yolk is absorbed by the developing young. During the second phase, the digits develop. In the last phase, the egg tooth appears.

==Reptilian incubation==
Methods of incubation vary widely among the many different kinds of reptiles.

Various species of sea turtles bury their eggs on beaches under a layer of sand that provides both protection from predators and a constant temperature for the nest.

Snakes may lay eggs in communal burrows, where a large number of adults combine to keep the eggs warm. Some species coil their torsos around the eggs to provide heat for incubation.

Alligators and crocodiles either lay their eggs in mounds of decomposing vegetation or lay them in holes they dig in the ground.

==Incubation by other vertebrates==
Fish generally do not incubate their eggs. However, some species mouthbrood their eggs, not eating until they hatch.

Some amphibians brood their eggs. The female salamander &quot;Ensatina&quot; (&quot;Ensatina eschscholtzii&quot;) curls around the clutch of eggs and massages individual eggs with her pulsating throat. Some aquatic frogs such as the Surinam toad (&quot;Pipa pipa&quot;) have pouches in their skin into which the eggs are inserted. Other neotropical frogs in the family Hemiphractidae also have pouches in which the eggs develop, in some species directly into juvenile frogs and in others into tadpoles that are later deposited in small water bodies to continue their development. The male Darwin&#x27;s frog carries the eggs around in his mouth until metamorphosis, and the female stomach-brooding frog of Australia swallows the eggs, which develop in her stomach.

==Incubation by invertebrates==
Brooding occurs in some invertebrates when the fertilised eggs are retained inside or on the surface of the parent, usually the mother. This happens in some cnidarians (sea anemones and corals), a few chitons, some gastropod molluscs, some cephalopods, some bivalve molluscs, many arthropods, some entoproctans, some brachiopods, some bryozoans, and some starfish.

<text>Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (13 February 1707 – 12 April 1777), called Crébillon or  (Crébillon the Gay) to distinguish him from his father, was a French novelist.

Born in Paris, he was the son of a famous tragedian, Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (Crébillon or Crébillon the Tragic). He received a Jesuit education at the elite Lycée Louis-le-Grand. Early on he composed various light works, including plays for the Italian Theatre in Paris, and published a short tale called &quot;Le Sylphe&quot; in 1730. From 1729 to 1739 he participated in a series of dinners called &quot;Le Caveau&quot; (named after the cabaret where they were held) with other artists, including Alexis Piron, Charles Collé, and Charles Duclos.

The publication of &quot;Tanzaï et Néadarné, histoire japonaise&quot; (1734), which contained thinly veiled attacks on the Papal bull Unigenitus, the cardinal de Rohan and others, landed him briefly in the prison at Vincennes. His novel &quot;Les Égarements du cœur et de l&#x27;esprit&quot; was published between 1736 and 1738 and was, although he continued to edit it in 1738, never finished. Publication of &quot;Le Sopha, conte moral&quot;, an erotic political satire, in 1742 forced him into exile from Paris for several months.

Around 1744 he entered into a romantic liaison with Lady Henrietta Maria Stafford, daughter of a Jacobite chamberlain, and they were married in 1748. A son was born in 1746 and died in 1750. Despite financial hardship, they lived together until her death in 1755. Meanwhile, he published &quot;La Nuit et le moment&quot; (1745), &quot;Ah! quel conte!&quot; and &quot;Les Heureux Orphelins&quot; (1754). Inheriting nothing from Henriette, he was forced to sell his large library in 1757 and eventually found steady income as a royal censor (like his father) in 1759. In 1768 and 1772 he published his last two novels, &quot;Lettres de la duchesse de *** au duc de ***&quot; and &quot;Lettres athéniennes.&quot;

<text>Charles Bianconi (24 September 1786 – 22 September 1875) was an Italo-Irish entrepreneur. Sometimes described as the &quot;man who put Ireland on wheels&quot;, he developed a network of horse-drawn coaches that became Ireland&#x27;s &quot;first regular public transport&quot; system. He eventually became known for his innovations in transport and was twice mayor of Clonmel, in County Tipperary.

==Early life==
Born Carlo Bianconi in Costa Masnaga, Italy on 24 September 1786, he moved from an area poised to fall to Napoleon and travelled to Ireland in 1802, via England, just four years after the 1798 rebellion. At the time, British fear of continental invasion resulted in an acute sense of insecurity and additional restrictions on the admission of foreigners. He was christened Carlo but anglicised his name to Charles when he arrived in Ireland in 1802.

==Career==
He worked as an engraver and printseller in Dublin, near Essex Street, under his sponsor, Andrea Faroni, when he was 16. In 1806 he set up an engraving, gilding and print shop in Carrick-on-Suir, moving to Clonmel in 1815.

Although widely regarded as the founder of public transportation in Ireland, he built on the system of mail coaches and roads that were built around Ireland before 1790 by the Scottish entrepreneur, John Anderson of Fermoy. After the collapse of Anderson&#x27;s mail coach and banking empire in 1815, Bianconi established regular horse-drawn carriage services on various routes from about 1815 onwards. He acknowledged two advantages that led to his success: 
The first service, Clonmel to Cahir, took five to eight hours by boat but only two hours by Bianconi’s carriage. Travel on a ‘Bian’ cost one penny farthing a mile. His open &#x27;Bianconi coaches&#x27; colloquially shortened to &#x27;Bians&#x27;, were a popular form of public transport for over a century. 

There were also a series of inns, the Bianconi Inns, some of which still exist; in Piltown, County Kilkenny and Killorglin, County Kerry. These services continued into the 1850s and later, by which time there were a number of railway services in the country. The Bianconi coaches continued to be well-patronised, by offering connections from various termini, one of the first and few examples of an integrated transport system in Ireland. By 1865 Bianconi’s annual income was about £35,000.

==Later life and death==
Bianconi died on 22 September 1875 at Longfield House, Boherlahan, County Tipperary.

Having donated land to the parish of Boherlahan for the construction of a parish church, Bianconi wished to be buried on the church grounds. He, and his family, are buried in a side chapel, separate from the parish church in Boherlahan, approximately 5 miles from Cashel, County Tipperary.

==Family==
In 1832 Bianconi married Eliza Hayes, the daughter of a wealthy Dublin stockbroker. They had three children - Charles Thomas Bianconi, Catherine Henrietta Bianconi and Mary Anne Bianconi the wife of Morgan John O&#x27;Connell and mother of John O&#x27;Connell Bianconi. Mary Anne published a biography of her father in 1878 which featured contributions by the artist Michael Angelo Haynes and the writer Anthony Trollope, who both knew him.

<text>Hongcun () is a village in Hongcun Town, Yi County, Huangshan City in the historical Huizhou region of southern Anhui Province, China, near the southwest slope of Mount Huangshan.

Together with Xidi, the village became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, because of its exceptional preservation of the architecture and city plan of a rural village in feudal China. Scenes from the film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; were filmed on location in Hongcun.

==History and city planning==
Hongcun was established in 1131 by Wang Wen, a general during the Southern Song dynasty. Like the neighboring Hu family in Xidi, the Wang family became prosperous merchants and the city grew in size from 1400 to about 1900. The architecture and carvings of the approximately 150 residences dating back to the Ming and Qing dynasties are said to be among the best of their kind in China. One of the biggest of the residences open to visitors, &quot;Chenzhi Hall&quot;, also contains a small museum.

The village is arranged in the shape of an ox with the nearby hill (Leigang Hill) interpreted as the head, and two trees standing on it as the horns. Four bridges across the Jiyin stream can be seen as the legs whilst the houses of the village form the body. Inside the “body”, the Jiyin stream represents the intestines and various lakes such as the “South Lake” (Nanhu) form the other internal organs. A 400-year-old waterway connects each residential household to the two water sources in the town, with most of the streets built alongside them. These streets are paved with original Yi County granite. The usual residences of the town contain a central courtyard surrounded by symmetrical bays of rooms, although there are much larger and more private houses for the weather citizens.


==Transportation==

Buses are available from Huangshan Bus Station. There are also buses from Tangkou Bus Station to Hongcun. Tangkou Bus Station is at the foot of Huangshan Scenic Area.

<text>The Beograđanka (; , lit. &quot;Belgrade Lady&quot;), officially &quot;Belgrade Palace&quot; (, ) is a modern high-rise building in the Belgrade downtown area.

A tall structure, it is one of the symbols of the city and representative of the &quot;golden age&quot; in the development of Belgrade during the 1965–1974 mayoral term of Branko Pešić.

== Location ==

The building is located at the intersection of Kralja Milana (central city street), Resavska, and Masarikova Streets—near the tripoint of the Savski Venac (whose territory the building lies on), Vračar and Stari Grad municipalities. Neighborhoods in the vicinity include Cvetni Trg to the east, Krunski Venac to the northeast, Andrićev Venac to the north, London to the northwest, and Savamala to the west. Three parks are close to the building: Pioneers Park, Manjež and Park Gavrilo Princip. Students Cultural Center and Yugoslav Drama Theater are just east of Beograđanka.

== History ==

House of Jeremija Milivojević was built on the location in 1890. It was a one-floor, corner house. The facades were ornamented in the Academism style. In 1941, right before World War II began in Yugoslavia, the plans were made to build the high-rise on the location. The investor was to be the , a major Serbian textile magnates. The plans were scrapped due to the outbreak of the war, and the Milivojević&#x27;s house remained until the mid-1960, when it was demolished. Planned pre-war commercial highrise was designed by architect Grigorije Samojlov.

Construction of the building began in 1969. It was built by two people of the same name and from the same part of Belgrade, Zemun: mayor of Belgrade Branko Pešić and architect , who designed it. Mayor Pešić laid the charter of the building&#x27;s construction into the foundations on 29 March 1969 and the building was opened on 22 April 1974.

During the digging of the foundation, ten strong water springs were discovered. Eventually, they were all conducted into the city sewage system. The construction was executed using the latest methods in constructing and during the next 5 years, some 20,000 workers of all kinds were employed in erecting the building.

== Characteristics ==

The building is located in the heart of old city center, stretching from Terazije to Slavija Square, with an emphasized aspiration to dominate with its high 24-story part as the city&#x27;s reference point. For decades, an observation deck was operational on the 22nd floor. There was also a restaurant &quot;Beograđanka&quot; next to it, known for its decorative gold plated tiles. The restaurant was closed in 1989 when &quot;Studio B&quot; purchased this floor.

The façade of the building consists of aluminium drapes and the double paned thermopane glass. The outer blinds are operated electronically. The material was imported from Italy. City chiefs were choosing between the darker and the lighter color of the façade material. They opted for the darker one, as it was of higher quality, but the choice wasn&#x27;t universally greeted at the time. The entire façade covers .

Total floor area of &quot;Beograđanka&quot; is .

In the 1980s, the disco club &quot;Šestica&quot; (The Six) was located on the building&#x27;s sixth floor. Though operational for only three years, it was quite popular because it provided patrons with an excellent view of the city. It was the only club in Belgrade at the time that was not located in an adapted utility room or a basement. Other hospitality venues were restaurant &quot;STB&quot; (formerly &quot;Plato&quot;) on the 5th floor (known for its decorative gold plated tiles) and club B-74.

=== Plateau of Đoko Vještica ===

After the idea of (1939-2008), journalist from Studio B, a drinking fountain was built on the plateau at the Beograđanka&#x27;s entrance. Named the &quot;Spring of Life&quot; (&quot;Vrelo života&quot;), it was opened on 6 April 1982, to commemorate the 6 April 1941, and German bombing of Belgrade in World War II. After Vještica&#x27;s death, the plateau was named in his honor. The plateau was embellished with the green wall along the Masarikova Street in 2014. The wall was fully renovated in April 2021.

== Assessment ==

The building invoked both admiration and criticism. Some architects thought that the Interbellum skyline of Belgrade, which the Beograđanka disrupted, should be preserved. The main problem, however, appeared to be the dark colored façade. The critics ascribed it to the current fashion in architecture after the Toronto-Dominion Centre, while citizens who opposed it said that dark building doesn&#x27;t fit to the white city (meaning of &quot;Belgrade&quot;) and that dark paint should be scratched. It was compared to the Space Odyssey&#x27;s Monolith or a tombstone, and called &quot;Black Widow&quot;, a common, colloquial nickname in Belgrade for dark buildings, or those with black rooftops.

Size and location were also criticized, due to the narrowed view on the Church of Saint Sava and problems with parking, communal services and deliveries. Some architects simply dismissed the entire design as &quot;being black&quot;, without evaluating all the other aspects of the building. Others asked was it really necessary to &quot;thrust&quot; it into the old core of the city. Still, with the lower annex, the building was nicely connected to the much lower objects in the adjoining block of buildings.

Despite Yugoslavia being a Communist, one-party state at the time, the architects chose for major project were selected from two dominant branches, either professorial or from business sector. However, though a professor, architect Pešić was directly appointed by the party, and this lack of public competition caused discomfort among the architects. Pešić was considered to be an excellent engineer but a weak creative mind. As soon as the building was finished, his colleagues massively criticized him personally, as a good professor but the one who would never escape the anonymity if not selected by the party for this job, and for the design itself. However, construction proved that Pešić was capable for the task, and in time only the criticism of the façade color remained.

Pešić declined to debate on the issue or to refute the criticism, believing he has done the right thing, designing Beograđanka just the way it is. His colleagues ignored the building for the next two decades. In the second half of the 1990s, at the meeting in the Belgrade&#x27;s Institute for the Protection of Monuments, a session was organized to select the post-war objects which will be protected as the cultural monuments. Architect Zoran Manević suggested Beograđanka, but was heavily criticized by other architects and his motion was almost unanimously rejected.

After several decades, it proved that the building neither damaged the Belgrade&#x27;s cityscape from any of the four sides (Syrmia, Banat, Zvezdara, Avala), nor &quot;darkened&quot; the White city as represents only one piece in the skyline&#x27;s mosaic. Actually, it turned out to be a good positioned tower-like counterpoint in the panoramic view of the city. Becoming symbol of Belgrade, in time it was labeled as an object which deserves social gratitude and accolade for the designers, a building that no one would be ashamed even today, including the problematic elements.

Still, though described as iconic and the most imposing building in the old section of Belgrade, even in the 2020s some architects criticized its design.

== Tenants ==

The building is almost completely owned and operated by the City of Belgrade. The first several stories were occupied by the Robne kuće Beograd department store; on the other floors offices of Studio B (formerly city-owned TV and radio station) and Happy TV station are located. On the other floors, there are business premises, as well as the head offices of IKEA for Serbia and other Belgrade media are also located in the building. &quot;Blic&quot; daily still has some offices in Beograđanka although they have moved most of their business to a new building.

After the privatization of the &quot;Robne kuće Beograd&quot; in 2007, owner of the first four floors became &quot;Verano Motors&quot;. Studio B is the only tenant who has been in the building since it was opened in 1974. As of June 2012, the basement floor is occupied by a Mercator retail store.

== Future ==

In January 2019, deputy mayor Goran Vesić announced the plans by the city to sell the building as it is the &quot;pure loss&quot; for the city. As the building is under the preliminary protection (meaning that it has to be treated like it is protected unless the protection process is rejected), so the prospective buyer can&#x27;t demolish it.

In July 2020, city offered half of the building for sale. The asking price was set at €20,6 million. The bidding was canceled on 31 July as no one applied. Architects, economists, citizens&#x27; groups and political opposition started criticizing city&#x27;s actions in these matters, especially with the similar, much longer failed process conducted for another symbol of Belgrade, the Sava Centar congressional center. Opposition politicians openly accused city administration of corruption and theft. Through repeated, collapsed biddings, the prices of the objects are being reduced each time, as allowed by the law, until they are sold to some tycoon close to the ruling establishment for a very low price. In August 2020 city again offered the same space for the lowered price of €16,5 million.

On 9 September 2020, offered part of Beograđanka was officially sold to the &quot;MPP New Project&quot;, a daughter company of the &quot;Marera Properties&quot;, for the offered price plus additional €8 million in future investments, as they were the only participants in the bidding. &quot;MPP New Project&quot; was founded two weeks prior to the bidding, with the capital of 100 Serbian dinars or €0.85. &quot;Marera Properties&quot; previously acquired several objects in Belgrade, founding separate companies for purchasing each one. Economic reporters and opposition parties regarded the sale as the confirmation of their claims that the entire job will be done &quot;within the family&quot;, or the ruling party. Iconic building was sold for the price of €860 /m2, which is considered &quot;miserable&quot; for downtown Belgrade. Reporters discovered that &quot;Marera Properties&quot; basically exists only on paper, and that behind it is the Russian fund seated in Cyprus connected with offshore companies from the British Virgin Islands, which also recycles money from Serbia. Several present and former executives of the company turned out to be, directly or indirectly, connected to Siniša Mali, Serbian finance minister and former mayor of Belgrade.

In January 2021 it was announced that the reconstruction will be finished by the end of the year. Decorative lights will be added along the facade of the building, from the fifth floor to the top.

<text>The Sum of All Fears is a political thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and released on August 14, 1991, as the sequel to &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1989). Main character Jack Ryan, who is now the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, tries to stop a crisis concerning the Middle East peace process wherein Palestinian and former East German terrorists conspire to bring the United States and Soviet Union into nuclear war. It debuted at number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

A film adaptation, which is a reboot of the Jack Ryan film series and starring Ben Affleck as the younger iteration of the CIA analyst, was released on May 31, 2002.

==Plot==
During the first day of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) prepares to conduct a tactical nuclear strike to stave off defeat. The necessity for the strike is averted, but an Israeli Mark 12 nuclear bomb is accidentally left on an A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft flown by Captain Mutti Zadin; which is subsequently shot down over Syria, near Kafr Shams. The nuclear weapon is lost, buried in the field of a Druze farmer. Eighteen years later, an Israeli police captain (coincidentally the brother of the downed pilot) converts to a fundamentalist sect of Hasidic Judaism after discovering his wife had an extramarital affair and attempts to instigate a violent demonstration of Palestinians at the Temple Mount. When the demonstrators unexpectedly conduct a peaceful protest, Zadin orders the police to fire tear gas and rubber bullets at the protesters anyway. Captain Zadin then kills the leader of the demonstration by shooting him point-blank. The United States finds it hard to diplomatically defend Israel, yet knows it cannot withdraw its support without risk of destabilizing the Middle East.

Following the advice of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) Jack Ryan, National Security Advisor Dr. Charles Alden enacts a plan to accelerate the peace process by converting Jerusalem into a Vatican-like independent city-state to be administered by a tribunal of Jewish, Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox religious leaders, and secured by an independent contingent of the Swiss Guards. As a nod to Israel, the U.S. Army supplies the IDF with more sophisticated equipment and agrees to construct a training base in the Negev Desert run by the U.S. Army&#x27;s tank warfare specialists and the revived 10th Cavalry Regiment. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, Ryan&#x27;s plan seems to work, in large part due to Ryan&#x27;s meetings with officials in Israel and Saudi Arabia and the acquiescence of the reformist President Andrey Narmonov in the democratized Soviet Union. With their religious contentions appeased, the factions in the Middle East find it much easier to negotiate their disputes.

White House Foreign Affairs Advisor Elizabeth Elliot holds a grudge against Ryan and Alden and maneuvers against them. She first takes Alden&#x27;s job as National Security Advisor by taking advantage of a sex scandal involving a child fathered by Alden out of wedlock, with the stress contributing to Alden&#x27;s death in a severe stroke that causes a blowout fracture. She concurrently begins a sexual relationship with widowed President J. Robert Fowler and manipulates him to publicly omit Ryan&#x27;s role in the peace settlement, taking credit for himself. After Ryan accuses her of wishing to silence an American opponent of the deal, Elliot engineers a smear campaign accusing Ryan of engaging in an extramarital affair and fathering a child with a young widow. Jack&#x27;s friends, CIA operatives John Clark and Domingo Chavez, convince Ryan&#x27;s wife Cathy that the allegations are false. Jack&#x27;s alleged mistress is Carol Zimmer, widow of Buck Zimmer, who was killed during Ryan and Clark&#x27;s earlier mission to rescue Chavez and his Army teammates from Colombia. Ryan later decides to retire from the CIA, but not before he puts together a covert operation to uncover corrupt dealings between Japanese and Mexican government officials.

Meanwhile, a small group of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorists, enraged at the looming failure of their jihad against Israel, come across the lost Israeli bomb and use it to construct their own weapon by using the bomb&#x27;s plutonium pit as fissile material for a new bomb. The terrorists enlist the help of disaffected East German nuclear physicist Manfred Fromm who agrees to the plot, wishing to exact his own revenge against his former communist country&#x27;s reunification as a capitalist democratic state. With Fromm&#x27;s expertise, the terrorists enhance the weapon by turning it into a modern style boosted fission weapon. The terrorists&#x27; plan is to detonate the weapon at the Super Bowl in Denver while simultaneously staging a false flag attack on U.S. military forces in stationed in Berlin by East Germans disguised as Soviet soldiers in order to ignite a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The East Germans hope that the war will eliminate both superpowers and punish the Soviets for betraying World Socialism, while the Palestinians hope the attack will destroy the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and end U.S. aid to Israel.

Thinking that his work on the bomb is complete, the Palestinians kill Fromm. However, Fromm had not yet told them that the tritium for the booster still needed to be filtered before use, to eliminate accumulated helium-3. The Palestinians assemble the bomb for use, but when detonated, the impure booster material causes only a low yield fizzle to occur. Even with low yield, the bomb still destroys the Super Bowl venue, killing nearly everyone there including the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the commander of NORAD. With the corresponding attacks in Berlin, the United States briefly assumes DEFCON-1 status as Fowler and Elliott prepare for a nuclear war. The crisis is averted by Ryan, who learns the domestic origin of the bomb&#x27;s plutonium, gains access to the hotline, and convinces the Soviet President to stand down his country&#x27;s military.

When the terrorists are captured and interrogated by Clark in Mexico City, they implicate the Iranian Ayatollah in the attack. President Fowler orders the Ayatollah&#x27;s residence in the holy city of Qom to be destroyed by a nuclear strike. Ryan averts the attack by enforcing the two-man rule. The terrorists are delivered to the FBI field office in Buzzard Point, where Ryan questions them. During questioning, Ryan falsely asserts that Qom was destroyed, tricking Qati into revealing that Iran was not involved, and that their deceit was meant to discredit the United States; thus destroying the peace process and allowing the campaign against Israel to continue. Elliot is sedated after suffering a nervous breakdown, while Fowler resigns office and is succeeded by his Vice President, Roger Durling.

The terrorists are executed by beheading in Riyadh by the commander of the Saudi Arabian special forces using an ancient sword owned by the Saudi royal family. Later, the sword is presented to Ryan as a gift. In the sequels, the gift (combined with his origins as a Marine) inspires Ryan&#x27;s Secret Service codename of &quot;Swordsman.&quot;

==Characters==
===The United States government===
* Jack Ryan: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. He develops the Vatican Treaty providing a final settlement on the Arab-Israeli conflict, but is overworked and unappreciated by President Fowler, who is unable to replace Ryan due to the latter&#x27;s popularity in Congress. He also has a deep rivalry with Dr. Elliot. As a result, he begins to develop alcoholism and increasingly poor health. He later decides to retire from the agency in order to overcome his drinking problem and spend more time with his family. During the events of the novel, Ryan becomes increasingly concerned about the growing economic dominance of Japan, which becomes a theme in the following novel &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;.
* J. Robert Fowler: President of the United States. Fowler was introduced in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; as the Governor of Ohio and a presidential candidate, and won against the incumbent President after he deliberately threw the election. Fowler is depicted as a former prosecutor opposed to capital punishment and in favor of broad social programs, although he angers Dr. Elliot and many of his supporters by refusing to commute the death sentences of the Ulster Liberation Army members depicted in &quot;Patriot Games&quot;. He is nicknamed &quot;Hawk&quot; by the U.S. Secret Service. He was widowed after his wife died from multiple sclerosis, and begins a romantic relationship with Dr. Elizabeth Elliot. He is motivated by his public image and desire to secure a legacy, and as a result takes credit for Ryan&#x27;s program. After the crisis on the Denver bombing, during which his decision-making deteriorates rapidly, he resigned from office and was succeeded by his Vice President, Roger Durling. According to an audio commentary in the DVD release of the film adaptation, Clancy has said that he based Fowler on 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, claiming that left-wing politicians are more likely to use nuclear weapons than right-wing ones.
* Elizabeth Elliot: Key advisor to President Fowler, and his lover. A former professor of political science at Bennington College, she was promised the position of National Security Advisor but later denied on the insistence of Fowler&#x27;s running mate Durling. At the beginning of the book, she finally achieves the position using a sex scandal against Dr. Charles Alden, and nearly derails Ryan&#x27;s plan by withholding a new radar system from Israel to coerce them to accept the deal. Holding a grudge on Ryan from their first encounter (depicted in previous novel &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;), she denies him credit for the Middle East peace plan and falsely leaks to the media that he has a mistress, severely straining his marriage. Her advice worsens the situation during the Denver crisis and she is later placed under sedation. She is nicknamed &quot;Harpy&quot; by the U.S. Secret Service. 
*Arnold &quot;Arnie&quot; van Damm: Chief of Staff to President Fowler. Van Damm is known for his informal dress style and his alertness to intrigue. Although he is personally areligious, he works with Ryan to consult the Vatican over his peace deal. Asks Ryan for his resignation the morning after Elliot is confronted by Cathy Ryan over Elliot&#x27;s media leaks, and they agree that Ryan can stay two weeks to wrap up Operation NIITAKA.
* Brent Talbot: Secretary of State. Talbot is a former Northwestern University professor of political science. He is killed in the Denver bombing.
* Scott Adler: Deputy Secretary of State.
*G. Dennis Bunker: Secretary of Defense. Bunker is a decorated former U.S. Air Force captain from the Vietnam War, flying a hundred F-105 combat missions and earning three Distinguished Flying Crosses during the bombing of Hanoi. He later gained fame by constructing a large business conglomerate in southern California and gaining ownership of the San Diego Chargers, and he bonds with the President over their mutual love of football. He is killed in the Denver bombing. 
* John Clark: Ryan&#x27;s personal driver and bodyguard, former CIA operative. 
* Domingo “Ding” Chavez: Clark&#x27;s partner, CIA field operative. Works as Ryan&#x27;s bodyguard while studying for a degree at George Mason University. 
* Dan Murray: Deputy Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
* Marcus Cabot: Director of Central Intelligence. Although he is initially inexperienced and adversarial towards Ryan, he grows to respect him after the Vatican Treaty. 
* Ben Goodley: Ryan&#x27;s assistant and protégé. A postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, he became noticed by the White House and the CIA for his analysis of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and is researching a thesis on the Vietnam War. Initially manipulated by Elliot into providing classified information on Ryan, which she would later use in her attempt to discredit him. Ryan&#x27;s diligence and professionalism with intelligence information during Elliot&#x27;s attacks makes Goodley rethink his initial opinions of Eliot and Ryan.
* Inspector Sean Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; O’Day: FBI agent who is Murray&#x27;s second-in-command.
* Dr. Charles Alden: A Yale professor of history who becomes the first National Security Advisor to President Fowler. Alden is a brilliant tactician who has a good relationship with Ryan despite their differing political views. However, his tendency to have affairs allows him to be undercut by Elliot, and he dies of a stroke after his affair with a student is discovered.
*Alan Trent: &quot;Japan-bashing&quot; Chairman of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

===The United States military===
* Bart Mancuso: Full captain (selected for Rear Admiral) commanding a squadron of ballistic missile submarines for the United States Pacific Fleet.
* Captain James &quot;Jim&quot; Rosselli: Duty officer at the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon during the Denver crisis, and former commanding officer of the Gold Crew of , an (the real-life &quot;Maine&quot; was launched in 1994, three years ahead of the novel&#x27;s timeline).
* Captain Harrison Sharpe &quot;Harry&quot; Ricks: Commanding officer of the Gold Crew of &quot;Maine&quot;, succeeding Rosselli. Dies after the &quot;Maine&quot; sinks following an explosion in his ship&#x27;s wake from a torpedo launched by the Soviet nuclear-powered attack submarine &quot;Admiral Lunin&quot;.
* Robby Jackson: Commander of the air group assigned to , an American aircraft carrier.

===The Soviet Union===
* Andrey Illich Narmonov: President of the Soviet Union, first introduced in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. He attempts to carry out democratization reforms in the Soviet Union during the events of the novel but is hindered by an unstable political system. His assistance helps to bring the Eastern Orthodox Church to support the Vatican Treaty. President Narmonov dislikes Fowler, finding him to be arrogant and overly controlling.
* Sergey Golovko: First Deputy Chairman of the Committee for State Security (KGB). 
* Oleg Kirilovich Kadishev: Leader of the opposition party in the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union and opportunistic CIA agent (codename SPINNAKER). His false reports to the CIA unfortunately reinforces the narrative that Narmonov has lost control of the Soviet military. This convinces Fowler and Elliot that the Soviet president had been a victim of a coup d&#x27;etat following the Denver bombing, which progressively worsens their judgment of the crisis.
* Oleg Yurevich Lyalin: A KGB illegal based in Japan who has a well-developed network of agents codenamed THISTLE. He uncovers the Japanese Prime Minister&#x27;s corrupt dealings with Mexico over trade agreements and offers his services to the CIA, which accepts him (codename MUSHASHI). Based on his intelligence, Ryan launches Operation NIITAKA, which later becomes instrumental in blackmailing the President of Mexico into allowing the arrest of Qati and Ghosn in Mexico City after the Denver bombing. Unfortunately, he was caught by the Soviets and charged with treason, but Ryan pleads with Golovko to free Lyalin since he did not reveal Soviet state secrets.
* Valentin Borissovich Dubinin: Captain First Rank of the Soviet Navy and commanding officer of the Akula-class submarine &quot;Admiral Lunin&quot;.

===The terrorists===
* Ismael Qati: Palestinian terrorist and mastermind of the bomb plot. He is suffering from terminal cancer. After being captured by Clark in Mexico City, he was later executed in Saudi Arabia.
* Ibrahim Ghosn: Palestinian terrorist and one of PFLP&#x27;s experts on explosives and electronics. It is stated that he nearly received a degree in engineering from the American University of Beirut but was prevented from formally completing his studies due to the 1982 Lebanon War. Allied with Qati, he is also executed along with him in Saudi Arabia.
* Günther Bock: German terrorist and ally of Qati and Ghosn. A former Red Army Faction member, the collapse of Marxism, coupled with the arrest of his wife and fellow terrorist Petra Hassler-Bock as well as the loss of their children, forces him to go into hiding. After learning about the Soviet Union&#x27;s cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism and Petra&#x27;s suicide, he is motivated to trigger a nuclear war with the U.S. and Russia by arranging a false-flag attack on American and Soviet forces in Berlin. Later killed during the battle and was identified by the German police.
* Marvin Russell: Professional criminal, drug dealer, and activist for the fictional Native American Warrior Society. A Sioux Indian living in the Badlands. Along with his brother John Russell, he had a history of juvenile delinquency while living with their impoverished family at a reservation in Minnesota and spent a year in prison. He developed a resentment towards the United States. After his brother is killed in a botched FBI operation, he travels to Europe to connect with international terrorists, gaining the trust of Qati by killing an undercover Hellenic Police officer in Athens and by comparing the Indian Wars to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He helps Qati and Ghosn enter the United States with the bomb. Deemed as a security risk, he was murdered by the two Palestinian terrorists in a Denver motel on the day of the nuclear detonation, but their sloppy work allows the FBI to ascertain the circumstances behind the bomb.
* Dr. Manfred Fromm: German engineer and terrorist who is recruited by Bock to assist in rebuilding and improving the captured Israeli nuclear weapon. Later executed by Qati&#x27;s men after his services were complete, unaware that Dr. Fromm had not yet finished the bomb.

=== Israel ===

* General Abraham &quot;Avi&quot; Ben Jakob: Assistant director of the Mossad, Israel&#x27;s foreign intelligence agency. Depicted as a friend of Ryan, he helps convince the Israeli Cabinet to accept the Fowler Plan after meeting with him despite his distrust of the U.S. government.
*Rafi Mandel: The Defense Minister of Israel. Mandel initially opposes the treaty but accepts it after admitting that Israel&#x27;s security status has improved from it and after Prime Minister Askenazi promises to support his planned bid for Prime Minister 
*David Askenazi: The Prime Minister of Israel. 
*Captain Benjamin &quot;Benny&quot; Zadin: An Israeli National Police officer in command in a demonstration at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Embittered by his personal problems, he kills an unarmed demonstrator there. Coincidentally the younger brother of Lieutenant Mordecai &quot;Mutti&quot; Zadin, an Israeli Air Force pilot who was shot down by Syrian surface-to-air missiles during the Yom Kippur War, unaware that he was carrying a nuclear weapon. The younger Zadin is ultimately committed to a mental institution.

=== The Muslim world ===

*Prince Ali bin-Sheik: Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia
*Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei: The Supreme Leader of Iran. Opposes the Vatican Treaty, and is falsely implicated by the terrorists in the Denver bombing.
*Hashimi Moussa: A 20-year-old Arab sociology student in Jerusalem and the leader of the demonstrations. Hashimi, who bears physical scars from police beatings, convinces the demonstrators not to enter the Temple Mount and adopt nonviolent protest, resulting in Israel losing international sympathy. Hashimi is killed by Captain Zadin.

=== Others ===

*Bob Holtzman: Senior White House correspondent for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, used by Elliot to discreetly out Ryan as being suspected of financial and marital improprieties. After being confronted with Clark&#x27;s evidence of Ryan&#x27;s innocence, he exposes Elliot&#x27;s part in the whole affair.
*Cathy Ryan: Ophthalmic surgeon at the Wilmer Eye Institute at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Becomes troubled with media reports of her husband Jack having a mistress, but is convinced by Clark, Chavez and Murray that the reports are lies. She then publicly embarrass Elliot at a White House dinner, who she knew from her student days at Bennington College. She is pregnant with Katie by the end of the novel.
*Carol Zimmer: Hmong American widow of Sergeant Buck Zimmer (detailed in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;). Ryan helps her and her family through an educational trust fund as well as setting up a 7-Eleven convenience store to supplement her family income. Elliot assumed this was proof that Zimmer is Ryan&#x27;s mistress.
*Solomon Mendelev: An Orthodox Jewish rabbi from New York City who accuses the U.S. government of trying to subjugate Israel through the Treaty. Although he has never set foot in Israel himself due to his religious beliefs, he sparks widespread opposition to the Treaty among the Israeli public, and Dr. Eliot&#x27;s attitude towards him worsens Ryan&#x27;s relations with her.

==Themes==
Written under the working title &quot;The Field of Camlan&quot;, which was based on King Arthur&#x27;s final battle, &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; explores nuclear fears that humans endured during the Cold War, with Clancy warning that complacency regarding such threats is dangerous. Published months after the first Gulf War, Clancy also envisioned a fictional “next great step” toward lasting peace in the Middle East. The book was said to be inspired by the 1977 thriller film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, which depicts a blimp being used as a weapon to blow up a football stadium during the Super Bowl; the movie was referenced three times.

A major theme is the limits and uncertainties surrounding information collected by intelligence agencies and the need for policy makers to acknowledge such limits and uncertainties: &quot;There is a difference between not knowing anything and understanding that you don&#x27;t know.&quot;

The novel also explores the danger of &quot;electing someone who covets power for all the wrong reasons and who is totally inept at managing it&quot;, according to Marc Cerasini&#x27;s essay on the book. President Fowler and Elliot were compared to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

===Etymology===
The title is a reference to nuclear war and to the plot by the novel&#x27;s antagonists to reconstruct a lost nuclear weapon. It comes from a Winston Churchill quote serving as the first of the novel&#x27;s two epigraphs:

===Jerusalem background===

The Vatican-like solution for Jerusalem, which was implemented in the book, is ultimately derived from the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which indeed provided for making Jerusalem such a &quot;Corpus separatum&quot; (Latin for &quot;separated body&quot;). The course which the 1948 Palestine war took prevented implementation of this plan. In later years, various peace plans and diplomatic initiatives sought to revive the idea, but in reality it has never come close to implementation. The plan is known for being popular outside the Middle East, but unpopular among the actual residents of Jerusalem, who would prefer that &quot;their&quot; &quot;side&quot; should rule entirely rather than submit to a neutral administration.

===&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; reference===
A database file with certain limited details about John Clark is included as background information within the first &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; game, and moreover, the same database entry is also found in many of the sequels. That entry mentions in passing that &quot;the Denver, Colorado atomic detonation [occurred] in 1989&quot;. That information might not be canonical, since the book is set &quot;after&quot; both the fall of the Berlin Wall (November 9, 1989) and the First Persian Gulf War (January–February 1991). If it is canonical, though, this means that the book is not set in the same year it was published. A second inference is that 1989 was likely the year in which President Fowler&#x27;s administration ended.

==Development==
Clancy started working on the novel in 1979, setting the first chapter during the Yom Kippur War. Then he abandoned his idea for other novels until he wrote &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1988), where Ryan first meets Russian premier Narmonov. After figuring out the resolution to &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, Clancy then used his next novel &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1989) as a way to introduce future President Fowler. Speaking of the consistency, Clancy said: &quot;The whole series really is a logical and connected network of plot lines which would continue to diverge and converge throughout the body of the work.&quot; The novel was notable for detailing the process in making a bomb; however, certain technical details were altered, and Clancy made clear in the novel&#x27;s afterword that a lot of information in his book can be found in the public domain.

Whilst the Israelis used both the A-4 single-seat single-engine subsonic light attack jet and F-4 two-seat twin-engined all-weather supersonic fighter-bomber during the Yom Kippur War, use of the A-4&#x27;s nuclear capability was never envisaged. Nuclear warheads were assembled at the Tel Nof Airbase, but for deployment on F-4 rather than A-4 as told in the novel. This was done on October 8 in such a way that the U.S. got to know of it by the next morning, prompting President Nixon to initiate the same day an immediate air-lifted re-supply to Israel of conventional arms, including tanks and planes to replace losses, in Operation Nickel Grass. Whether any of these nuclear bombs were actually carried during a sortie has never been documented.

At least one real-world buried nuclear warhead has actually been documented however, but American and in the U.S., rather than Israeli in Syria. The plutonium pit of a Mark 39 nuclear bomb warhead remains buried 33m deep in a North Carolina field, now fenced-off, following the fatal 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash. Many B-52 Stratofortresses crashed while carrying live nuclear warheads on training flights, mostly inside the U.S., between 1961 and 1968, but many have been recovered.

==Reception==
The book received positive reviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the novel as &quot;a nonstop roller-coaster ride to a nail-biting finish&quot;, adding: &quot;Fundamentally, Clancy is writing about a vital and elusive quality: grace under pressure. Whether terrorists or statesmen, Clancy&#x27;s characters face a common challenge—situations that break down pretensions of rank, power and ideology. Their responses, carefully and empathetically constructed, make this book compelling instead of merely ingenious.&quot; Kirkus Reviews hailed it as &quot;hair-raising&quot; and &quot;quite a rouser&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
The book was adapted as a feature film, which was released on May 31, 2002. Jack Ryan was played by Ben Affleck while John Clark was played by Liev Schreiber; additionally, CIA director Marcus Cabot, whose first name was changed into William, was played by Morgan Freeman. The film is a reboot that departs from all previous Ryan films, and as a result, there were significant changes from the book, such as the antagonists being neo-Nazis instead of Palestinian terrorists, Ryan becoming a low-level CIA analyst, and the time period changed to 2002. Clancy served as executive producer on the film, and regarding the changes from his book, jokingly introduced himself in the commentary track on the DVD release as &quot;the author of the book that he [director Phil Alden Robinson, who is present with Clancy] ignored&quot;. Nevertheless, he complained about technical inaccuracies throughout the film in the commentary.

&quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; was a major financial success, grossing a total of $193 million in box office. However, it received mixed reviews from critics; Rotten Tomatoes reported that 59% of critics gave the film positive reviews and that the average rating was 6/10 based on a total of 171 reviews counted.

In turn, the film had its video game adaptation, which is a tactical first-person shooter game that is similar to the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; series of games. It was developed by Red Storm Entertainment and released by Ubisoft in 2002.

<text>Public displays of affection (PDA) are acts of physical intimacy in the view of others. What is considered to be an acceptable display of affection varies with respect to culture and context.

Some organizations have rules limiting or prohibiting public displays of affection. Displays of affection in a public place, such as the street, are more likely to be objected to, than similar practices in a private place with only people from a similar cultural background present.

==Worldwide==
===Religiosity===
Religiosity is an important factor that influences how romantic relationships develop. Higher levels of religiosity are not directly related to the number of partners reported by the respondents. However, religious respondents report lower levels of intimate contact with their partners. It is apparent that religiosity limits the level of expression of affection in general. Also, religion is related to more conservative values that may have a global effect on all levels of PDA by younger participants.
Seemingly religiosity may work in two different ways where religious communities are in general quite racially segregated around the world, and people with strong religious beliefs may be very unlikely to engage in sexual activity or even to date someone due to the morals advised by their religion. In many regions of the world, religion drives the cultural view on PDA and this sometimes culminates into proscription based on religious rules, for example sharia law, Catholic and Evangelical virginity pledges, Anabaptist plain people, Methodist outward holiness, Quaker testimony of simplicity, Latter-day Saint Law of chastity, Judaic Tzniut, etc. The conservative Islamic schools of thought, especially Salafism-oriented ones, forbid public displays of affection.

=== Western world===
In most of the Western world, such as Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and Latin America, it is very common to see people holding hands, hugging and sometimes kissing in public. It is not usually socially acceptable to be overly explicit, such as engaging in sexual activities.

=== China ===
Historically, the Chinese have regarded most, to all physical contact between opposite sex as unacceptable. The earliest iconic record of such view is &quot;Mencius: Li Lou I&quot; (孟子 · 離婁上, written in the Warring States Period), in which Mencius (), a Confucian scholar and philosopher, states &quot;It is the etiquette that males and females shall not allow their hands to touch in giving or receiving anything.&quot; The exact quote writes and is still widely used until this day. Younger generations in more developed parts of China are less afraid of displaying their affections towards their partners in public (partially affected by the emergence of Western culture). It is common to see males and females holding hands or wear coordinating outfits in urbanized cities. &quot;Simply observing the sheer mass availability of condoms and hyper-sexualized advertisements and may attest to China&#x27;s increasing acceptance of Public Displays of Affection.&quot; However, traditional ideals still have a strong influence on social norms of relatively remote regions.

Following the rise of social media in the 21st century, Chinese netizens coined the expression () for public display of affection. The neologism quickly popularized and gained the connotation of &quot;being lovey-dovey to piss off single people.&quot; According to a 2004 research by Weiyi Zhang, a researcher from Fudan University, the dissemination of PDA culture in China is largely ascribed to an ultramodern desire to gain public recognition and reality confirmation.

Mothers from the Manchu minority ethnic group, as only researched in the 1900s in Aigun of Northern Manchuria where the researcher S. M. Shirokogoroff personally believed the Manchu element were &quot;purer&quot; than those of Southern Manchuria and Peking (now Beijing), used to show affection for their children by performing fellatio on their male babies, placing the penis in their mouths and stimulating it, while they regarded public kissing with revulsion.

===India===
Public display of affection might be regarded as socially unacceptable in India if it disturbs others or creates nuisance. Same-sex physical contact is allowed. Under section 294 of the Indian Penal Code, causing annoyance to others through &quot;obscene acts&quot; is a criminal offence with a punishment of imprisonment up to three months or a fine, or both. For example, in 2007, when actor Richard Gere kissed Shilpa Shetty in an AIDS awareness event in New Delhi, a warrant for his arrest was issued by an Indian court, which was overturned by a higher court. However, the Supreme Court of India on various occasions have said that kissing or hugging between adults in public is legal. In 2009, the far-right group Sri Ram Sena physically attacked couples celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day in Mangalore, stating that it goes against Indian culture. In the state of Kerala, a public kissing display named Kiss of Love was held in November 2014 in protest against moral policing.

===Middle East===
Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are predominantly Muslim cultures. Although public displays of affection generally do not fit the local culture and customs, it varies even among these countries. Decency laws do not allow public displays of affection. Penalties can be severe based on the action in different countries. Travellers to Dubai have been given jail sentences for kissing in public. In 2009 a British couple caught publicly kissing in Dubai were deported following a three-month prison sentence. An unmarried Indian couple, who were in a taxi, were sentenced to one year in prison for hugging and kissing. The taxi driver drove the couple directly to a police station. Kissing is considered &quot;an offence to public decency&quot;.

Islamic religious police prohibits public display of affection.

== Adolescent==

Relationships outside the family become increasingly important during adolescence. Although several studies of basic social processes have been conducted by sociologists, much of the research and theorizing about adolescent relationships has been carried out by developmental psychologists. Much more research has been done in the area of specific adolescent behaviors, which has shown that these behaviors are predicted well by relationship variables to include the display of affection.
Affection or intimacy references a pattern of conduct within relationships that includes subjective assessments of attachment. This pattern of conduct is a part of a larger constellation of factors that contributes to an adolescent&#x27;s development of a non-parental relationship. Sociologists have explored the more general terrain of gender relations, although several of the key studies focus on preadolescence and early adolescence. Their work highlights the degree to which features of these early relations, and even intense personal feelings such as being in love, are socially constructed. Adolescents&#x27; conceptions about and conduct within these relationships are heavily influenced by interaction and communication with others. Specific rules emerge (e.g., one should always be in love, it is wrong to date more than one person) and gossip or other social sanctions serve as important sources of informal social control around these rules.
Research moves into the early adolescent period when youths are old enough to say they are going steady and is useful in actually characterizing the nature of these relationships. These liaisons are described as highly superficial and based on unrealistic idealised expectations. Furthermore, the desire of adolescents to put on a good &quot;front&quot; inhibits the development of intimacy. Going steady is a limiting factor on the adolescent social ritual.

This table below shows the quality and context of displays of affection in American adolescence among intra-racial couples:


Boys and girls begin the process of relating to one another, the transition is much easier for adolescent males, who essentially transport their dominant interaction styles (derived from peer interactions) into this new relationship form with the opposite sex. Public displays of affection may facilitate the demonstration of this dominant interaction style transference in a socially acceptable way.

Experimental research on communication processes observed in same- and mixed-gender groups to support this idea. Although behavior observed in cross-gender task groups is relevant, intimate dyadic relationships and task groups are not equivalent social contexts. Thus, an alternative hypothesis is that boys, who have less practice than their female counterparts with PDA (by virtue of their peer group experiences), must make a larger developmental leap as they move into the heterosexual arena. For example, examining the messages students write one another in high-school yearbooks, there were marked differences between boys&#x27; discourse directed towards friends (e.g., &quot;you&#x27;re a lousy wrestler…&quot;) and that directed towards romantic partners (e.g., &quot;you are very beautiful in so many ways, it would take me a lifetime to express them in words…&quot;). In contrast, young girls&#x27; use of language in messages to close friends and boyfriends is more similar in form and content. To the degree that the romantic context provides their only opportunity to express themselves and, more broadly, to relate in this intimate fashion, young males are more dependent on these relations than female adolescents, who have close friends for intimate talk and social support. This uniqueness figures into the aetiology of more negative and sometimes gendered relational dynamics that also emerge in connection with romantic involvements stalking, intrusive control efforts, violence, and the like.

==Same-sex==

Public displays of affection between individuals of the same sex may or may not suggest homosexuality depending on the cultural context. For example, in many African cultures it is socially acceptable for people of the same sex to participate in public displays of affection, whereas in other countries such as the United States and Portugal, it is considered indicative of homosexuality. Public displays of affection tend to be determined largely by culture, which greatly influences perceptions of same-sex PDA.

Intolerance for homosexual PDA is commonplace in large swathes of society in many different cultures. For instance, in Portugal, LGBT individuals only act in ways that contend contemporary ideals and political/economic agendas. Homosexual individuals are less likely to partake in public displays of affection because their society is extremely critical of the act. They believe that by behaving according to what society deems appropriate, (e.g., only opposite-sex couples should partake in acts of public displays of affection), they are protecting themselves from being categorized as abnormal, odd, or deviant. Although same-sex marriage has been legal in Portugal since June 2010 (see Same-sex marriage in Portugal), LGBT people still refrain from public displays of affection for the most part. This detail may suggest that Portugal&#x27;s acceptance of same-sex marriage is due to the fact that the LGBT individuals do not broadcast their sexuality, not that the public of Portugal is more accepting of these acts. Although it may appear that homosexual individuals are ambivalent about being limited in only displaying affection privately, it seems to happen out of fear of resentment or being perceived as odd rather than out of respect for their societies&#x27; political beliefs and attitudes.

There have been many in-depth studies regarding societal attitudes towards homosexuality across many different factors. One study found that heterosexual people had higher negative attitudes towards homosexuals of their own sex, especially if they felt that they were being targets of sexual advances. They also found that men have less negative attitudes towards homosexual females than males whereas women tend to be more accepting overall of homosexuals and their role in society. In the contemporary Western society, attitudes towards same-sex public displays of affection vary across cities much like they vary across countries. In populations where the majority of individuals have high cultural values and are more accommodating, same-sex or same-gender public displays of affection are more likely to occur. This is understandable because same-sex individuals feel less persecuted by others in society and are less likely to feel as though they are being categorized as odd, abnormal, or deviant like those in Portugal.
Of course, there are negative attitudes towards same-sex or same-gender public displays of affection as well. In a Colorado high school, two yearbook staff resigned after they were informed that they could not print the relationship page because it had a photo of two females holding hands. A spokesman for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project declared in 2007 that &quot;people are still verbally harassed and physically attacked daily for engaging in simple displays of affection in public. Everything changes the minute we kiss&quot;.

==Social media==
Expression of a person&#x27;s feelings towards someone else had previously been limited to written letters, phone calls, or in person. In the modern world, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are growing, with 1.7 billion users on Facebook and over half a billion Twitter users. Studies on relationships through Facebook found that, when two individuals who are interested in one another both use Facebook regularly, their relationship progresses in different increments than it would without social media. After two people meet and form an interest, one or both individuals will go on to the other person&#x27;s Facebook page and get information such as relationship status, pictures, and interests. Once a relationship begins, some couples broadcast their relationship with posts, such as pictures and changing the relationship status.

How people show their public displays of affection on social media sites can be indicative of relationship security and personality. Frequent and recent communication with a romantic partner through different forms of social media is an indicator of relational escalation, whereas limited communication has shown to be an indicator of alienation or relational de-escalation. Another study has shown that when someone focuses on relationship status and public displays of affection such as posting about activities with the significant other or their feelings towards them, that person tends to be more possessive or territorial over their partner.

A study found female characters on prime-time television programs are less likely to demonstrate physical affection if they had a larger body type than thinner female characters. Thus, even television producers act in a way as to intentionally limit public displays of affection based on the appearance of their actors, and that might affect viewership based on social disapproval. Regardless of television portrayals, the frequency and intensity of PDA has a tendency to depend upon the cultural context as well as perceived public perceptions of the couple, including their age group, racial composition, sexuality, and relationship centralized activity on social media.

==Effects on romantic relationships==
Studies have found physical affection to be associated with positive outcomes in romantic relationships. For instance, it has been related to the formation of attachment bonds and psychological intimacy. Physical affection has been categorized into seven different types including holding hands, cuddling/holding, backrubs/massages, caressing/, kissing the face and cheek, close hug, and kissing on the lips. Five of these behaviors, with the exception of caressing/stroking and holding hands, have been positively associated with relationship and partner satisfaction.

<text>Mitsuru Yoshida (吉田 満 &quot;Yoshida Mitsuru&quot; January 6, 1923 – September 17, 1979) was a Japanese author and naval officer. He was born in Tokyo. He was a survivor of the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; when it was sunk on 7 April 1945 during Operation Ten-Go, an attempt to support the defenders of Okinawa.

His best-known work is &quot;Senkan Yamato-no Saigo&quot; (&quot;Requiem for Battleship Yamato&quot;), based on his personal experiences as a junior officer on &quot;Yamato&quot;&#x27;s final voyage. It was made into a movie &quot;Senkan Yamato&quot; (&quot;Battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;&quot; Shin-Toho. Dir.: Yutaka Abe) in 1953. Another movie, &quot;Yamato&quot;, was released in 2005.

<doc id="523767" wikidata="Q200231" url="?curid=523767" title="Oise (river)">
<text>The Oise ( ; ) is a river of Belgium and France, flowing for from its source in the Belgian province of Hainaut, south of Chimay. It crosses the border with France after about , and flows into the Seine at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-western suburb of Paris. Its main tributary is the Aisne. It gave its name to the French departments of Oise and Val-d&#x27;Oise.

==Places along the river==

In France, the Oise flows through the following &quot;départements&quot; and towns:
*Aisne: Hirson, Guise, Chauny
*Oise (named after the river): Noyon, Compiègne, Creil
*Val-d&#x27;Oise (named after the river): Auvers-sur-Oise, Pontoise, Cergy, Jouy-le-Moutier
*Yvelines: Conflans-Sainte-Honorine

==Navigation==

Over the past few centuries, the Oise has played an important role as an inland shipping waterway connecting the Seine (and thus Paris) with the coastal regions of northern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Robert Louis Stevenson described his canoeing trip on the Oise in his first published book, &quot;An Inland Voyage&quot;.

With the projected construction of the Seine-Nord Europe Canal, a high-capacity water transport system currently in development, the Oise will be linked at Janville, north of Compiègne, with the high-capacity Canal Dunkerque-Escaut, east of Arleux. The Seine-Nord Europe Canal will replace the old Canal de Saint-Quentin and the current Canal du Nord, the capacity of which is far below standard. When the new Seine-Nord connection is complete, it will allow large vessels to transport goods from the Seine, and thus Paris and its surrounding area, to the ports of Dunkirk, Antwerp and Rotterdam.

Part of the overall project consists of upgrading the river Oise itself between Creil and Compiègne, a project called MAGEO (&quot;Mise au gabarit européen de l&#x27;Oise&quot;) that was put out to public consultation in 2013. Some bends need to be eased and bridges raised to meet the requirements of a class Vb inland waterway.

<doc id="523770" wikidata="Q73185" url="?curid=523770" title="Caramelization">
<text>Caramelization is a process of browning of sugar used extensively in cooking for the resulting butter-like flavor and brown color. The brown colors are produced by three groups of polymers: (C24H36O18), (C36H50O25), and (C125H188O80). As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl (known for its intense butter-like taste) are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.

Like the Maillard reaction, caramelization is a type of non-enzymatic browning. Unlike the Maillard reaction, caramelization is pyrolytic, as opposed to being a reaction with amino acids.

When caramelization involves the disaccharide sucrose, it is broken down into the monosaccharides fructose and glucose.

==Process==

Caramelization is a complex, poorly understood process that produces hundreds of chemical products, and includes the following types of reactions:
* equilibration of anomeric and ring forms
* sucrose inversion to fructose and glucose
* condensation reactions
* intramolecular bonding
* isomerization of aldoses to ketoses
* dehydration reactions
* fragmentation reactions
* unsaturated polymer formation

==Effects of caramelization==
The process is temperature-dependent. Specific sugars each have their own point at which the reactions begin to proceed readily. Impurities in the sugar, such as the molasses remaining in brown sugar, greatly speed the reactions.
Caramelization reactions are also sensitive to the chemical environment, and the reaction rate, or temperature at which reactions occur most readily, can be altered by controlling the level of acidity (pH). The rate of caramelization is generally lowest at near-neutral acidity (pH around 7), and accelerated under both acidic (especially pH below 3) and basic (especially pH above 9) conditions.

==Uses in food==

Caramelization is used to produce several foods, including:

* Caramel sauce, a sauce made with caramel
* &quot;Confiture de lait&quot; and &quot;dulce de leche&quot;, caramelized, sweetened milk
* Caramel candies
* Crème caramel, and the similar crème brûlée, a custard dish topped with sugar caramelized with a blowtorch
* Caramelized onions, which are used in dishes like French onion soup. Onions require 30 to 45 minutes of cooking to caramelize.
* Caramelized potatoes
* Caramelized pears
* Cola, of which some brands use caramelized sugar in small amounts for color
* Latik, a sweet syrup made of sugar and coconut milk which is used in several Filipino desserts.
* Dodol, a type of toffee made with cane sugar, rice flour, and coconut milk originating from Indonesia.

<text>Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon (8 November 167623 January 1753) was the daughter of Henri Jules de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, and Anne Henriette of Bavaria. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, she was a &quot;princesse du sang&quot;. Forced to marry the Duke of Maine, legitimised son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, she revelled in politics and the arts, and held a popular &quot;salon&quot; at the Hôtel du Maine as well as at the Château de Sceaux.

==Biography==
===Birth===

Louise Bénédicte was born on 8 November 1676 at the Hôtel de Condé in Paris. She was the eighth child born to the then Duke and Duchess of Enghien. The name Bénédicte was added in honour of the child&#x27;s maternal aunt, the Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

She was brought up at the Hôtel de Condé with her many sisters and had to endure slave-like conditions under the madness of her father. Her mother, who was pious and gentle, was often beaten by her father as were their staff and her sister Marie Anne, Mademoiselle de Montmorency. When formally addressed, Louise Bénédicte was known as &quot;Mademosielle d&#x27;Enghien&quot;. As a princess of the blood, she possessed the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. When she was nine years old, her father was given the title of &quot;Count of Charolais&quot;, and as a result Louise Bénédicte became known as court as &quot;Mademoiselle de Charolais&quot;. This appellation would later pass to her niece Louise Anne.

She was very outspoken and witty, and had a terrible temper. As she was very small and paid much attention to her appearance, she was nicknamed &quot;poupée du Sang&quot; at the French court, literally, &quot;Doll of the Blood&quot;, a play on the honorific &quot;princesse du sang&quot;, princess of the Blood. This nickname is sometimes said to have been made up by her sister-in-law the Duchess of Bourbon. She was close to her sister Marie Anne, whose marriage to the Duke of Vendôme (1654–1712) she later arranged. Although born with a lame arm, she was generally thought to be the most attractive of the Condé daughters. Despite this &quot;Madame&quot;, Duchess of Orléans, sister-in-law of Louis XIV called her a &quot;little toad.&quot; Some time after her marriage, the Duchess of Orléans also said that &quot;Madame du Maine is not taller than a child ten years old, and is not well-made. To appear tolerably well, it is necessary for her to keep her mouth shut; for when she opens it, she opens it very wide, and shows her irregular teeth. She is not very stout, uses a great quantity of paint, has fine eyes, a white skin, and fair hair. If she were well-disposed, she might pass, but her wickedness is insupportable&quot;. She was very short like her older sister Anne Marie, &quot;Mademoiselle de Condé&quot;. Louise Bénédicte and her oldest sister Marie Thérèse de Bourbon, known as &quot;Mademoiselle de Bourbon&quot; until her marriage to &quot;le Grand Conti&quot; in 1688, were considered the most attractive of the daughters born to the Condés.

&quot;Mademoiselle d&#x27;Enghien&quot; received the typical education given to girls of the nobility in France and was taught reading, writing, dancing, singing and other matters which were considered necessary for a young aristocrat. She spent most of her time in the company of her mother and two older sisters.

===Marriage===

At first, it was proposed that she marry Louis de Bourbon, Count of Vermandois, son of Louis XIV and Louise de La Vallière. However, the count died in exile in 1683. Louis XIV arranged several marriages into princely houses of France for his legitimised children by Louise de La Vallière. Prior to her marriage, she saw the marriage of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans to &quot;Mademoiselle de Blois&quot;, future &quot;duchesse d&#x27;Orléans&quot;. Louise Bénédicte&#x27;s own brother Louis de Bourbon had even had been forced to marry &quot;Mademoiselle de Nantes&quot;, eldest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.

In 1692, the 15-year-old Louise Bénédicte married the 22-year-old Louis Auguste de Bourbon, &quot;Légitimé de France&quot;, Duke of Maine.

The wedding ceremony took place on 19 May 1692 in the chapel of the Palace of Versailles, Madame de Montespan was not invited but all of Maine&#x27;s siblings attended as well as the princes and princesses of the blood. As both the groom and his wife were physically handicapped, members of the court joked that &quot;look at the union of a one-armed woman and a lame man! What a beautiful couple!&quot;. 
The marriage was not happy. The couple did not like each other, Louise Bénédicte found her husband weak and abhorred his lack of ambition. He could not stand her terrible temper and deliberate attempts to embarrass him at court. Louise Bénédicte&#x27;s is said to have had several affairs which were known to Maine. To her husband, she was recorded as saying, &quot;Just look at yourself – a lame bastard! – and you&#x27;d like to boss me? I am a pure bred royal princess, Monsieur, with no stain on my cradle! What would you be without the sticks at which everyone laughs? One to support your body, and the other, me, to maintain your rank! And this Leggy wants to rule my steps!&quot; (Since Maine limped, his wife called him &#x27;Gambillard&#x27;, which meant leggy).

In order to escape the dull court of Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV&#x27;s secret wife since October 1683, the enthusiastic &quot;duchesse du Maine&quot; created a little court at the Château de Sceaux, where she entertained brilliantly and immersed herself in political intrigues. The château, the former residence of Jean-Baptiste Colbert and his family, was bought in 1700 by her husband for the sum of 900,000 livres. Louise Bénédicte spent a further 80,000 livres on its furnishings and decorations.

After extensive renovations, she took up residence in December 1700. There, she began to be called &quot;La Reine des Abeilles&quot;, or Queen of the Bees. In 1703, to amuse herself, Louise Bénédicte created her own personal chivalric order, the Order of the Honey Bee. She gave the order to thirty-nine people. Each member had a robe embroidered with silver thread, a wig in the shape of a beehive and a medal embossed with a profile of Louise Bénédicte and engraved with the letters L. BAR. D. SC. D.P.D.L.O.D.L.M.A.M, meaning &quot;Louise, baronne de Sceaux, dictatrice perpétuelle de l&#x27;ordre de la Mouche à miel&quot; (&quot;Louise, baroness of Sceaux, dictator of Order of the Honey Bee&quot;).

To her small court, Louise Bénédicte attracted a host of literary figures of the day, including the young Voltaire, the &quot;baron de Montesquieu&quot;, the &quot;cardinal de Bernis&quot;, the &quot;comte de Caylus&quot;, Charles-Jean-François Hénault and Jean-Baptiste Rousseau.

In 1710, she helped to plot the marriage of her sister, Marie Anne, &quot;Mademoiselle de Monmorency&quot;, to the famous general Louis Joseph de Bourbon, &quot;duc de Vendôme&quot;. For mercenary reasons, Louise Bénédicte wanted a marriage that would not produce any children. Upon the death of a childless Vendôme, Louise Bénédicte hoped that she or her children would inherit the duke&#x27;s huge estate, which he had acquired as the grandson of the rich heiress, Françoise of Lorraine. At thirty-two, Marie Anne was considered past child-bearing age, and Vendôme was a well known homosexual, thirty years older than his prospective bride. As it happened, though, Louise Bénédicte got nothing. On the duke&#x27;s death, Marie Anne was created Duchess of Étampes in her own right and inherited the Hôtel de Vendôme in Paris, where she died in 1718 from alcoholism.

Both the Maines doted on their children. Their daughter, who would remain close to her mother until her death, was baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714. &quot;Mademoiselle du Maine&quot; was given the name of her paternal aunt Louise Françoise de Bourbon, known at court as &quot;Madame la Duchesse&quot;. &quot;Madame la Duchesse&quot; had grown up with Maine under the care of Madame de Maintenon.

The guest of honour at the baptism of &quot;Mademoiselle du Maine&quot; was the small dauphin, the future Louis XV, who was chaperoned by Maine&#x27;s other sister, the new Duchess of Orléans. The cardinal de Rohan baptised &quot;Mademoiselle du Maine&quot;. Thanks to the help of Madame de Maintenon, who had always loved Maine, Louis XIV created Maine a &quot;Prince of the Blood&quot; which put him in line of succession to the throne. In his will, Louis XIV also appointed Maine to be the Regent of France for his five-year-old great-grandson, the future Louis XV.

===Regency of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans===

At the death of the king in 1715, however, the Parlement of Paris annulled Louis XIV&#x27;s will and named Maine&#x27;s brother-in-law, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans, as Régent for the child king. Upset with this and the role played by the &quot;duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot; in reducing the status of the legitimised children of Louis XIV from the rank of &quot;Princes du Sang&quot; (which Louise Bénédicte had enjoyed since birth) to mere peers of France, Louise Bénédicte induced her husband to join in the Cellamare Conspiracy in the hope of transferring the regency to King Philip V of Spain, the uncle of Louis XV. The plot was named after Antonio del Giudice, Duke of Giovinazzo, Prince of Cellamare, who was the Spanish ambassador to France.

In order to gain more support for a new regent, Louise Bénédicte started a correspondence with Giulio Alberoni, the Spanish Prime Minister. Among her co-conspirators were the Duke of Richelieu and Melchior de Polignac. The plot, however, was discovered, and both the Maines were arrested and forced to abandon their residence at Sceaux. In 1719, the duke was imprisoned in the Doullens fortress and the duchess in Dijon. Their two sons were put in the care of their governor in Gien, and their daughter was taken from a convent at Maubuisson to another convent at Chaillot in Paris, in the area of the present Trocadéro. She stayed at Chaillot until 1720 when her parents were released from their separate imprisonments.

After her release, Louise Bénédicte led a more peaceful life at Sceaux, still surrounded though by her little court of wits and poets. On 27 December 1718, before their exile, she and her husband had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from her sister Marie Thérèse de Bourbon. It was originally designed by the architect Robert de Cotte, but they had hired a new architect, Armand-Claude Mollet, to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the Hôtel du Maine (destroyed 1838).

At the time of her imprisonment, she was trying to arrange the marriage of her eldest son, Louis Auguste de Bourbon, heir to the Maine&#x27;s fortune, to his cousin Charlotte Aglaé, Mademoiselle de Valois. The rivalry between the Maines and Charlotte Aglaé&#x27;s father, the Duke of Orléans, was well known, and it was hoped that the wedding would heal old wounds. A marriage did not occur, however, as the young &quot;Mademoiselle de Valois&quot; refused her cousin, much to the annoyance of the proud Louise Bénédicte. Madame du Maine was not happy when she found out that Charlotte Aglaé had considered the hand of another cousin, Charles de Bourbon, the son of &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;, Louise Bénédicte&#x27;s brother, and &quot;Madame la Duchesse&quot;, Maine&#x27;s sister.

===Widowhood===

After their release from imprisonment in 1720, the Maines seemed to have reconciled and led a more compatible life rather than being hostile to each other. In May 1736, the duke died at the age of sixty-six. Louis XV allowed Louise Bénédicte to keep her apartments at Versailles next to those of her daughter. These apartments overlooked the Orangérie. Both her sons also had apartments at court, but both preferred to stay in the country hunting. Madame du Maine tried on more than one occasion to arrange an advantageous marriage for her daughter. The first was to one Monsieur de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. Later, she tried to convince the widower Jacques I, Prince of Monaco, who was often at Versailles, to wed again. Despite the lure of a large dowry, both men considered Mademoiselle du Maine to be very unattractive. Unwed, she died in 1743. She was buried at the Église at Sceaux. At the time of her death, her library was numbered at having some 3000 books.

In 1736 Louise Bénédicte received the medieval Château de Montrond, which she allowed to be dismantled for its stone and the slate and lead in its roof. In 1737, she leased the Hôtel Peyrenc-de-Moras (today the Musée Rodin) in Paris from the widow of Abraham Peyrenc de Moras. During the remainder of her life, this was also referred to as the Hôtel du Maine, and she died there in January 1753. Dying at the age of seventy-six, Louise Bénédicte had outlived all of her siblings. She was buried at the Saint Jean-Baptiste church in Sceaux. Her oldest son, Louis Auguste, died less than two years after her, having been injured in a duel at Fontainebleau. Her youngest surviving son, Louis Charles, never married and died childless in 1775. He left his fortune to his first cousin, the already wealthy Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre.

<text>The Tabula Capuana (&quot;Tablet from Capua&quot;; Ital. &quot;Tavola Capuana&quot;), is an ancient terracotta slab, , with a long inscribed text in Etruscan, dated to around 470 BCE, apparently a ritual calendar. About 390 words are legible, making it the second-most extensive surviving Etruscan text. The longest is the linen book &quot;(Liber Linteus)&quot;, also a ritual calendar, used in ancient Egypt for mummy wrappings, now at Zagreb. The Tabula Capuana is located in the Altes Museum, Berlin.

==Description==

Horizontal scribed lines divide the text into ten sections. The writing is most similar to that used in Campania in the mid-5th century BC, though surely the text being transcribed is much older. The text is boustrophedon, with the first line to be read left to right, the next right to left, etc.

Attempts at deciphering the text (Mauro Cristofani, 1995) are most generally based on the supposition that it prescribes certain rites on certain days of the year at certain places for certain deities. The ten visible sections seem to each be devoted to a different month, March through December, January and February presumably having been treated in the missing top sections. The text itself was edited by Francesco Roncalli, in &quot;Scrivere etrusco&quot;, 1985.

Recently, a major scholar in the field, Bouke van der Meer, has proposed a &quot;very tentative partial word-for-word translation&quot; of the text:

==Text example==
(/ indicates line break; some word breaks are uncertain) 

===First section (lines 1-7): MARCH?===

The first legible section likely is devoted to rituals to be held in March (though the Etruscan word for this month, &quot;Velcitna&quot;, does not occur in the legible text, presumably because it was in the missing parts).

There are three to five initial lines missing and then 30-50 characters missing in the initial damaged lines shown here.

:: ...vacil.../2ai savcnes satiriasa.../3...[nunθ?]eri θuθcu
:: vacil śipir śuri leθamsul 
::: ci tartiria /4 cim cleva 
::::ac asri halχtei
:: vacil iceu śuni savlasie...
(~5-8 characters broken off at the end of this line)
::: /5[mul]u rizile picasri 
::::savlasieis
:: vacil lunaśie vaca iχnac 
::::fuli/6nuśnes 
:: vacil savcnes itna 
::: mulu rizile picasri 
::::iane
:: vacil l/7eθamsul scuvune 
::::marzac saca⋮ 

Notes: 
In line 1 and throughout, &quot;vacil&quot; may mean &quot;libation&quot; (or some similar rite or ceremony), in which case each of the first phrases beginning with it presumably indicate what deity to pour a libation to and perhaps other information. However, Steinbauer (agreeing with Rix) has challenged this assumption and, considering that it seems to be positioned at the beginning of a series of phrases within the context of a step-by-step instruction, proposed that &quot;vacil&quot; (with its variants &quot;vacal&quot; and &quot;vacl&quot;) simply means &quot;then.&quot;

In line 2, &quot;savc-nes&quot; according to van der Meer is an Apolline god, perhaps related in form to &quot;saucsaθ&quot; at 3.15 of the Liber Linteus. The form in the Liber Linteus, preceded as here by the term &quot;vacl&quot; &quot;libation,&quot; also falls in a section that probably deals with March, though as here there is no explicit mention of a month name. The relevant text from that passage of the Liber Linteus is as follows (3.15-3.17): &quot;vacl . an . ścanince . saucsaθ . persin / cletram . śrenχve . iχ . ścanince . ciz . vacl / ara&quot; roughly: &quot;The libation which was poured to &quot;Sauc- Pers-&quot; (should be performed) with the decorated litter just as it had been poured (before); perform the libation three times.&quot;

Note that the ending &quot;-nes/-nis&quot; also occurs in the forms &quot;fulinuś-nes&quot; (5-6) and &quot;caθ-nis&quot; (9), all referring to deities.

In line 2, &quot;satiriasa&quot; (if one word) may be a form of &quot;Satre&quot; the Etruscan term for Saturn, which also appears on the Piacenza Liver among chthonic deities. Or it could be in some way connected to or contrasting with &quot;tartiria&quot; at the end of line 3.

In line three, &quot;śuri&quot; is a (not necessarily exclusively) chthonic deity. The form also appears on the Lead Plaque of Magliano. &quot;Leθam-s&quot; appears on the Piacenza Liver among chthonic deities, but may have other connections as well. The genitive is used here as usual for indirect object.

In lines three and four, &quot;ci(m)&quot; means &quot;three,&quot; and both &quot;tartiria&quot; and &quot;cleva&quot; indicate kinds of offerings, yielding a possible partial translation: &quot;To Lethams, three &quot;tartiria&quot; (perhaps related to Greek Tartaros, as if &#x27;(gifts) for the underworld&#x27;?) offerings and three &quot;cleva&quot; offerings ...&quot; In line 4, &quot;halχ-&quot; is likely the name of a kind of vase.
A verbal form of &quot;vacil&quot; may be seen in line 5: &quot;vac-a&quot; &quot;make a libation (to)?&quot;; But van der Meer reads &quot;faca&quot; here, with unknown meaning. A similar form, &quot;vac-i&quot; is in line 28, also preceding a form of 
&quot;fuli/nuśnes&quot;. Also in line 5, &quot;lunaśie&quot; brings to mind the Roman moon goddess, &quot;Luna&quot; (which some equate with &quot;Cath&quot;, see below).
&quot;pi-cas(ri)&quot; (5,6) is defined by Pallottino as a verb of offering, to be compared with &quot;a-cas&quot; &quot;to do; to offer.&quot; &quot;mulu-&quot; (4/5, 6) and &quot;scu-&quot; (7, 10) seem to be roots meaning &quot;to offer, give&quot; and &quot;finish&quot;, respectively; and &quot;sac-&quot; means &quot;carry out a sacred act; consecrate.&quot; In lines 5-6, &quot; fuli/nuśnes&quot; may be a form of Fufluns, the Etruscan Dionysus who is associated with the Etruscan goddess &quot;Caθa&quot; who also seems to be mentioned in this text (see below). A somewhat similar form, &quot;fuln[folnius]&quot; can be found on line 29 of the Tabula Cortonensis.

Note the frequent repetitions (besides &quot;vacil&quot;): &quot;savcnes&quot;(2, 6); &quot;leθamsul&quot;(3, 6/7, 8...); &quot;mulu-ri zile picas-ri&quot;(4/5, 6, 18/19 but with...&quot;a-cas-ri&quot; rather than &quot;pi-cas-ri&quot;); &quot;savlasie(is)&quot;(4, 5); &quot;scu-vune marza(c)&quot;(7) versus &quot;marza...scuvse&quot;(10)...

The tentative partial translation by van der Meer, building on the work of many others suggests this part of the ritual calendar calls for an indeterminate offering be made to the god Saucne, and that libations be performed for the gods Śuri and Letham as well as for the gods Saulasie and Fulinusne. Furthermore, that a gifted &quot;rizile&quot; be accepted in [the period of?] Iana. And that, the libation to Letham having been properly completed, a &quot;marza&quot; be consecrated.

===Second section (starting on line 8): APRIL = &quot;apirase&quot;===
The second section seems to be devoted to rituals to be held in April.

:::vaiuser snenaziulas

Notes: Line 8 shows the form &quot;isvei&quot; which occurs frequently in the Liber Linteus where it appears to mean &quot;festival&quot; or &quot;ides&quot;. If the form &quot;iśum&quot; in line 13 is related, it may mean &quot;festive&quot; or (more likely) &quot;appropriate for a sacred festival&quot; &gt; &quot;sacred.&quot; The form &quot;tul(e)&quot; (8, 9, 10) in some contexts means &quot;stone&quot;, perhaps related to &quot;tular&quot; &quot;border&quot; (&lt; &quot;stone marking a border&quot;?), itself probably related to (or the origin of?) Umbrian &quot;tuder&quot; &quot;boundary&quot;; also the origin of the Umbrian town name Todi. Here it seems to mean &quot;(on or after) the ides (of a particular month).&quot; According to van der Meer, &quot;iluc-ve/u&quot; (twice in line 8) means &quot;feast.&quot; Of course, &quot;iśvei&quot; and &quot;tule&quot; can&#x27;t both mean &quot;ides&quot;, and in any case, the Latin &quot;ides&quot; originally fell on the full moon and was sacred to Jupiter, but since the deities recognizable here are underworld (&quot;leθams&quot; and &quot;caθ&quot;), &quot;tul&quot; may instead refer to the dark phase of the moon, or the new moon (Latin &quot;kalends&quot;). As van der Meer points out elaborately elsewhere, the contrast between light and dark gods was very important for the Etruscan calendar and for how they divided up the heavens.

&quot;apirase&quot; may mean &quot;(in the) month of April.&quot; See above for &quot;Leθam-sul&quot;. Van der Meer translates &quot;pep-ri&quot; as &quot;must be held.&quot; &quot;cipen&quot; seems to be a priestly title (with variants &quot;cepa(r)&quot;, &quot;cepe(n)&quot;).

&quot;huθ&quot; in line 9 means &quot;six&quot;, and &quot;ci&quot; in line 11 means &quot;three.&quot; &quot;zusle(-vai)&quot; (9, 11) means &quot;sacrificial victims&quot; perhaps specifically &quot;piglets.&quot; 

At the end of line 9, &quot;caθ-nis&quot; may be a form of Catha, an Etruscan goddess, with an ending &quot;-nis/-nes&quot; also seen above in other theonymns: &quot;savc-nes&quot; (lines 2 and 6) and &quot;fuli/nuś-nes&quot; (lines 5-6). Rarely depicted in art, she is number 8 (among celestial gods) and number 23 on the Piacenza Liver.

&quot;sacri&quot; (10) is certainly connected to words meaning &quot;sacred; victim for sacrifice&quot;—Latin &quot;sacer&quot;, Umbrian &quot;sacra&quot; sakra, Oscan sakri-, and to &#x27;saca&#x27; in line 7 above.

&quot;nunθe-ri&quot; (11 twice) seems to be a verb &quot;invoke&quot; or &quot;offer&quot;, with the necessitive ending &quot;-ri&quot; also seen in &quot;pep-ri&quot;(8), &quot;picas-ri&quot;(5), &quot;mulu-ri&quot;(4/5), and perhaps &quot;śu-ri&quot;(3) and &quot;sac-ri&quot;(10). &quot;eθ&quot; (11, 12) means &quot;thus.&quot; &quot;avθ-leθ&quot; (12) may be related to &quot;avθa&quot; &quot;northwind; eagle.&quot;

The word &quot;acun&quot; in line 11 may be from Greek &quot;agon&quot; (ἀγών) originally &quot;struggle&quot;, which came to be used as a term for festivals involving competitive sports; compare Latin &quot;Agonalia&quot; festivals in honor of Janus in Rome held in January, March, May and December. Later forms show syncope (loss of word-internal vowels): &quot;acn-es-em&quot; on the Liber Linteus (10.5)) and &quot;acn-s . priumn-es&quot; &quot;the &quot;agon&quot; of Priam&quot; on the left side of the Volterna urn.

The tentative partial translation by van der Meer, building on the work of many others, suggests this part of the ritual calendar calls: for a Cuieschu Feast to be performed for the god Letham on the Feast of April [which is] on the Ides; that Racvanies be the Priest of April; that six piglets be offered for the ritual ; that a &quot;snuza&quot;, which [is] in the [area of?] Hamai, be declared by Cive [and] by Cathni; and that a statuette of Mariś, which is in the [area of?] Hamai, be consecrated for Ita (? or &quot;for this (festival)&quot;?); that &quot;utu&quot; be given with &quot;ecun&quot; and with &quot;scuvsa&quot; by the &quot;Ita&quot; priest in the ritual; that three piglets and an &quot;acun siricima&quot; be offered, and further that &quot;iśuma&quot; (sanctified items?) be offered with the April piglets in the&quot;avθla&quot;, but (in this case) for Aiu; that a libation be offered to Letham here (=&quot;at this point&quot;?); that a libation be made here (as part of?) the ritual; furthermore that the (sacrifice to?) &quot;aθena&quot; be held; concerning the love gifts placed in Uni&#x27;s sanctuary on Earth Day (&quot;celitule&quot;) in April, take away (any that are not) &quot;iśum&quot; (sanctified?) in Uni&#x27;s sanctuary; that three gifts be offered in &quot;epn-&quot; (and?) a vase (&quot;halχ&quot;) here in the &quot;eit&quot; (of the?) ritual; that a libation (be performed) on the Aperta day for the Festival of Aphe in &quot;zuchn-&quot;; that an offering be made of &quot;elfa&quot; by the people involved in the ritual, and of young Adonis (?) boars for Calu with &quot;vana&quot; in the vineyard; that the people of the cult of the servant girl, and the &quot;vaiuser&quot; priest (?) of Hivu and of Nithu, and the people of Hivu, and the &quot;vaiuser&quot; of the cult of the servant girl (make an offering of) three &quot;tartiria&quot; (and) three love gifts for Aphe during the ritual. 
===Third section (lines 18-20): MAY = &quot;an/mpile&quot;===

:: iśvei tule ilucve anp[ili]e laruns ilucu huχ 
:::: śanti huri alχu esχaθ canulis
:: mulu/19 rizile zizri
:: inpa [...] an acasri
:: tiniantule leθamsul ilucu perpri
:::: śanti arvus/20ta aius nunθeri

&quot;Larun, Canuli, Tinia&quot;, and &quot;Aiu&quot; are names of Etruscan gods; &quot;huχ&quot; may mean &quot;celebrate&quot;, &quot;alχu&quot; &quot;given,&quot; &quot;esχaθ&quot; &quot;bring, place&quot;; &quot;arvusta&quot; &quot;(produce of the) field&quot; (compare Umbrian arvam &quot;field&quot;; arvia &quot;fruits of the field, grain&quot;).

Again, in van der Meer&#x27;s tentative translation, in summary, the text calls: for a Festival for Larun to be celebrated on the Feast Day of May (namely) on the ides; that Canulis should bring the gifted &quot;huri&quot; (wild fruits?) vase; that the gifted &quot;rizile&quot; that must be offered (during ...?) must be &quot;ziz&quot;-ed; that the feast for Lethams must be held on the day of Tinia; and the vase of the fruits of the field be offered to Aiu.

===Fourth section (lines 21-24): June = &quot;acalva&quot;===

Notes: in line 23, the deity &quot;Thanur&quot; (&quot;Thanr&quot;) is a goddess frequently present at the birth of other Etruscan deities and is part of the circle of Turan. But in the Lead Plaque of Magliano, she appears amongst mostly underworld deities, suggesting she is both a goddess of birth and of death. The form &quot;laχ(u)-&quot; &quot;basin&quot; (twice in line 25) may be akin to Latin &quot;lacus&quot; &quot;basin, water, lake.&quot;

Summarizing van der Meer, the text calls: for a feast for Lethams to be prepared in June on the day of Aperta Saiuvia; for the priest of Ita and of Sva to (present) a dish on the fifth day, and a &quot;falal&quot; (gift of heaven?) on the day of Husiluta; that &quot;seri&quot; gifts will have been brought by Velthur and by the T... family; that gifts will have been brought for Thanur by the Pacusnausia (family?); and that some piglets (will have been brought) by the Nis family for Shilaciia Esa, with &quot;salcha&quot; and with &quot;calaia&quot;, with &quot;len..a&quot; and with &quot;stizaita&quot;, (and) two cups and two...; that the ..nia family will also have brought some &quot;seri&quot; gifts; that the offerings be made in a basin (&quot;laχuθ&quot;); that &quot;eitu&quot; must be made (as an offering); that (those gifts placed) in the basin be those gifts that were brought; that hereby &quot;elthu&quot; be made; (and) that an offering of piglets be made in the &quot;stiza&quot;; the Pacusnasia family will have brought gifts ritually in the &quot;cachina&quot; thus--with &quot;lathiuma&quot; and with a piglet, with &quot;śiχaia&quot; and with &quot;t[ar]tiriia&quot;, with &quot;zanuse&quot; and with &quot;pepθia&quot;...

===Fifth section: probably July (= &quot;parθum&quot;?)===

Taking up lines 28-30. According to a gloss &quot;TLE&quot; 854, the name of July in Etruscan should be &quot;Traneus&quot;, but the names of the Etruscan months may have varied from place to place, as they did in Greece.

Summarizing van der Meer, the text calls: for a festival to be held in July on the Feast of the Ides for Tinun (and) for Sethums; that a priest pour a libation (over?) &quot;tartiria&quot; gifts for Fulinushnai; [here follows illegible material ending with] of...&quot;eta&quot;; that a feast (be prepared) for Natinushna; that Fulinushnai hold this (?); [and the rest is illegible, except for an initial] &quot;eθu&quot;...

===Sixth section: probably August (=&quot;papu&quot;?)===
Taking up lines 31-35. From this point on, the tablet is badly damaged and almost no coherent translations can even be attempted beyond the first line below. Again, gloss &quot;TLE&quot; 854 indicates that the name of August in Etruscan should be &quot;[H]ermius&quot;, but the names of the Etruscan months may have varied from place to place.

::macvilutule papui[...]se ilu[cve...]θasχra turza esχa[θ...]e[s] rapa

Tentative translation of first line: On the fifth day of August, on the (day) of the feast (of ?), bring ...&quot;-θasχra&quot; gifts and cups. [The rest is mostly obscure.]

==Discovery==
The tablet was uncovered in 1898 in the burial ground of Santa Maria Capua Vetere.

<text>The Pat Metheny Group was an American jazz band founded in 1977 by guitarist and composer Pat Metheny, along with his core collaborating member, keyboardist and composer Lyle Mays. Other long-standing members included bassist and producer Steve Rodby from 1981 to 2010, and drummer Paul Wertico from 1983 to 2001, after which Antonio Sanchez became the percussionist from 2002 to 2010. Vocalist Pedro Aznar was also a long-time member, performing with the group from 1984 to 1993. In addition to a core quartet, the group was often joined by a variety of other instrumentalists expanding the size to six or eight musicians.

==History==

===1970s===
Founder Pat Metheny first emerged on the jazz scene in the mid-1970s with a pair of solo albums. First was &quot;Bright Size Life&quot;, released in 1976, a trio album with bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius and drummer Bob Moses. The next album, released in 1977, was &quot;Watercolors&quot;, featuring Eberhard Weber on bass, pianist Lyle Mays, and drummer Danny Gottlieb.

In 1977, bassist Mark Egan joined Metheny, Mays, and Gottlieb to form the Pat Metheny Group. ECM released the album &quot;Pat Metheny Group&quot; in 1978 with songs co-written by Metheny and Mays. &quot;Pat Metheny Group&quot; showcased Mays&#x27; use of the Oberheim synthesizer, which became an integral part of the group&#x27;s sound. In 1979, the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;American Garage&quot;, reached No. 1 on the jazz chart in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

===1980s===

The Pat Metheny Group released the album &quot;Offramp&quot; in 1982. &quot;Offramp&quot; marked the first recorded appearance of bassist Steve Rodby in the group (replacing Mark Egan), and also featured Brazilian guest artist Naná Vasconcelos. Vasconcelos had appeared on the Pat Metheny/Lyle Mays album &quot;As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls&quot; in 1981, and his performance on percussion and wordless vocals marked the first addition of Latin-South American music shadings to the Group&#x27;s sound. &quot;Offramp&quot; was also the group&#x27;s first recording to win a Grammy Award, the first win of many for the group.

In 1983, a live album titled &quot;Travels&quot; was released. It won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance in 1984, which also brought the release of &quot;First Circle&quot;, a popular album that featured compositions with mixed meters. With this album, the group featured a new drummer, Paul Wertico (replacing Danny Gottlieb). Wertico and Rodby had both played with the Simon &amp; Bard Group. A soundtrack album &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; followed in 1985. It featured the song &quot;This Is Not America&quot;, a writing and performing collaboration with David Bowie which reached #14 in the UK Top 40 and #32 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in early 1985.

The South American influence would continue and intensify on &quot;First Circle&quot; with the addition of Argentine multi-instrumentalist Pedro Aznar. This period saw the commercial popularity of the band increase, especially thanks to the live recording &quot;Travels&quot;. &quot;First Circle&quot; would also be Metheny&#x27;s last project with the ECM label; Metheny had been a key artist for ECM but left over conceptual disagreements with label founder Manfred Eicher.

The next three Pat Metheny Group releases would be based around a further intensification of the Brazilian rhythms first heard in the early &#x27;80s. Additional South American musicians appear as guests, most notably Brazilian percussionist Armando Marçal. The Group&#x27;s first release on Geffen Records was &quot;Still Life (Talking)&quot; (1987). The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Minuano (Six Eight)&quot;, represents a good example of the Pat Metheny group compositional style from this period: the track starts with a haunting minor section showing Mays&#x27; compositional influence, yielding to a jubilant major melody more typical of Metheny. A Metheny solo builds into an intricate, composed marimba section followed by a brief, but metrically and harmonically complex interlude, both characteristic of Mays, before finally leading to a reprise of the minimalistic Metheny theme. Another popular track was &quot;Last Train Home&quot;, a rhythmically relentless Metheny piece that builds to a single point of release where wordless vocals finally enter.

The 1989 release &quot;Letter from Home&quot; continued this approach, with the South American influence becoming even more prevalent in its bossa nova and samba rhythms.

===1990s===

Metheny subsequently concentrated on solo and other small-group projects, and four years went by before the release of the next Pat Metheny Group album. This was a live set recorded in Europe in 1993 titled &quot;The Road to You&quot; and it featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums alongside new tunes. By this stage, the group had integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its sound, including Mays&#x27; addition of midi-controlled synthesized sounds to acoustic piano solos, accomplished via a pedal control.

Mays and Metheny refer to the following three Pat Metheny Group releases as the triptych: &quot;We Live Here&quot; in 1995, &quot;Quartet&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Imaginary Day&quot; in 1997. Moving away from the Latin style which had dominated the releases of the previous decade, these albums included hip-hop drum loops, free-form improvisation on acoustic instruments, and symphonic signatures, blues and sonata schemes. On some tunes from this era, the band also experimented with thrash metal, electronica, and folk music from parts of the world unexplored by the band in the past.

===2000s===
After another hiatus, the Pat Metheny Group re-emerged in 2002 with the release &quot;Speaking of Now&quot;, marking another change in direction through the addition of younger musicians. Joining the core players (Metheny, Mays and Rodby), were drummer Antonio Sanchez from Mexico City, Vietnam-born trumpeter Cuong Vu from Seattle, and bassist/vocalist/guitarist/percussionist Richard Bona from Cameroon.

Following the group&#x27;s 2002 tour, Bona left to concentrate on his solo career, but appeared as one of two guest artists (the other being mallet cymbalist Dave Samuels) on the group&#x27;s final release, 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Way Up&quot;, together with a new group member, Swiss-American harmonica player Grégoire Maret. &quot;The Way Up&quot; is a long-form recording which consists of a single 68 minute-long piece split into four sections. Metheny has said that one of the inspirations for the labyrinthine piece was a reaction against a perceived trend for music requiring a short attention span and which lacks nuance and detail. Many of the textures in &quot;The Way Up&quot; are created from interlocking guitar lines; Steve Reich is credited on the CD as an inspiration, along with Eberhard Weber, and there are large open sections for solo improvisation and group interplay. On the group&#x27;s 2005 tour (when its lineup was supplemented by Brazilian multi-instrumentalist Nando Lauria), &quot;The Way Up&quot; was played in its entirety as the first half of the concert. The final performance of the piece was at a free show for more than a hundred thousand people at the close of the 2005 Montreal Jazz Festival.

Their final album, &quot;The Way Up&quot; was released through Nonesuch Records. It is planned that all of Metheny&#x27;s Geffen and Warner Bros. Records albums are to be rereleased on the label.

The Pat Metheny Group played at the Blue Note Tokyo and Blue Note Nagoya in December 2008 and January 2009 in its core quartet of Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby and Antonio Sanchez. This quartet version of the group later toured the jazz festivals of Europe in the summer of 2010 for their &quot;Songbook Tour&quot;. These concerts featured music from all eras of the group but no new material.

<text>Vrisa () is a village in the southern part of Lesbos island approximately 50 km from Mytilene. The village is named after one of the two girls Agamemnon took from Lesbos during the ten-year Trojan War. Five kilometers south is the famous Vatera beach.
On June 12, 2017 Vrisa was severely damaged in an earthquake that struck approximately 12 km South of the town of Plomari. Most people could not return to their homes, rendering the village effectively a &quot;ghost village&quot;.

== Notable people ==

<text>A mashup (also mesh, mash up, mash-up, blend, bastard pop or bootleg) is a creative work, usually a song, created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs, typically by superimposing the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the instrumental track of another and changing the tempo and key where necessary. Such works are considered &quot;transformative&quot; of original content and in the United States they may find protection from copyright claims under the &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine of copyright law.

==History==
The 1967 Harry Nilsson album &quot;Pandemonium Shadow Show&quot; features what is nominally a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; but actually introduced the &quot;mashup&quot; to studio-recording. Nilsson&#x27;s recording of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; mashes his own vocal recreations of more than a dozen Beatles songs into this track. Nilsson conceived the combining of many overlaying songs into one track after he played a chord on his guitar and realized how many Beatles songs it could apply to. This recording has led some to describe Harry Nilsson as the inventor of the mashup. Other recordings regarded as early examples of, or forerunners to, the mashup include Buchanan and Goodman&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Saucer&quot; (1956), Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Medium Is the Massage&quot; (1967), the John Benson Brooks Trio&#x27;s &quot;Avant Slant&quot; (1968), Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel&quot; (1981), Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Tug of Peace&quot; (1983), the &quot;Hip Hop Mix&quot; of Climie Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Rise to the Occasion&quot; (1987), Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers&#x27; &quot;Jive Bunny: The Album&quot; (1989). and Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;Journeys by DJ: 70 Minutes of Madness&quot; (1995).

Although described as a medley in its title, &quot;Do It Again Medley with Billie Jean&quot; by Italian music project Club House could be described as one of the first ever commercially released mashups in 1983. The song combines elements of &quot;Do It Again&quot;, a 1973 top 10 hit in the US and Canada by Steely Dan, with Michael Jackson&#x27;s number one hit from earlier in the year, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. It reached number 11 in the UK, and the top 10 in Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands.

Another early mashup appeared in 1985, when The Tubes released their studio album, &quot;Love Bomb&quot;. The second side of the album contained the track &quot;Theme from a Wooly Place&quot;, which combined the tunes &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; in one channel and &quot;Theme from A Summer Place&quot; in the other.

In 1990, Norman Cook reached number one in the UK Singles Chart with his act Beats International with &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;, essentially a mashup of re-recorded vocals of the SOS Band&#x27;s &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot; with the Clash&#x27;s &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot;, making it the first mashup to achieve significant mainstream success.

The 1990 John Zorn album &quot;Naked City&quot; features a version of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Woman&quot; set over the bassline of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.

In 1991, the Source featuring Candi Staton released &quot;You Got the Love&quot;, based on a mashup created by DJ Eren Abdullah that had been an underground club hit since 1989, placing a Candi Staton a cappella over an instrumental version of Frankie Knuckles and Jamie Principle&#x27;s house track, &quot;Your Love&quot;. It reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, and had continued success over subsequent years with several remixes and a cover by Florence + the Machine.

In 1994, the experimental band Evolution Control Committee released the first modern mashup tracks on their hand-made cassette album, &quot;Gunderphonic&quot;. These &quot;Whipped Cream Mixes&quot; combined a pair of Public Enemy a cappellas with instrumentals by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. First released on home-made cassettes in early 1992, it was later pressed on 7&quot; vinyl, and distributed by Eerie Materials in the mid-1990s. The tracks gained some degree of notoriety on college radio stations in the United States.

The name Pop Will Eat Itself was taken from an &quot;NME&quot; feature on the band Jamie Wednesday, written by David Quantick, which proposed the theory that because popular music simply recycles good ideas continuously, the perfect pop song could be written by combining the best of those ideas into one track. Hence, &quot;pop will eat itself&quot;.

Pre-empting the rise of the mashup in the 2000s, German trance act Fragma reached number one in the UK and the top 10 in Australia and across Europe with &quot;Toca&#x27;s Miracle&quot;, a mashup of their previous single &quot;Toca Me&quot; and Coco Star&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;I Need a Miracle&quot;, initially created by British DJ Vimto in 1999.

The mashup movement gained momentum again in 2001 with the release of the &quot;2 Many DJs&quot; album &quot;As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2&quot; by Soulwax&#x27;s Dewaele brothers, which combined 45 different tracks; the same year a remix of Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; was also released by Freelance Hellraiser, which coupled Aguilera&#x27;s vocals with the guitar track of &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; by New York&#x27;s the Strokes, in a piece called &quot;A Stroke of Genie-us&quot;.

In 2001, English producer Richard X had created a bootleg mashup of Adina Howard&#x27;s &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; and Tubeway Army&#x27;s &quot;Are &quot;Friends&quot; Electric?&quot;, titled &quot;We Don&#x27;t Give a Damn About Our Friends&quot;, which became a successful underground dance track under his alias Girls on Top. He could not get permission to use the original vocals to release the mashup commercially, so he enlisted the English girl group Sugababes to re-record the vocals. It was released in April 2002, giving the group their first UK number one single, and drawing further recognition, acclaim and mainstream success for the mashup genre. Richard X had continued success with two more mashups reaching the UK top 10: &quot;Being Nobody&quot; (number 3), with pop group Liberty X combining vocals of Chaka Khan and Rufus&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; with the Human League&#x27;s &quot;Being Boiled&quot;, and &quot;Finest Dreams&quot; (number 8), featuring American vocalist Kelis singing the vocals from the SOS Band&#x27;s &quot;The Finest&quot; over an instrumental of the Human League&#x27;s &quot;The Things That Dreams Are Made Of&quot;.

At the 2002 Brit Awards held on 20 February 2002, Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue performed a mash-up version of her number one hit &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, combined with New Order&#x27;s song &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. The live performance is cited as one of the first by a mainstream recording artist to utilise a mashup, and was ranked at number 40 on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 2011 list of 50 Key Events in the History of Dance Music. The mashup, titled &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Blue Monday Out of My Head&quot;, was later released as the B-side to &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and was included on Minogue&#x27;s 2008 remix album &quot;Boombox&quot;. In the years that followed, mash-ups became more widely used by major artists in their live performances, particularly to update previous material to meld with the themes and sounds of their more recent work. For example, on her 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna incorporated elements of the Trammps&#x27;s &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; in the performance of her 2000 hit &quot;Music&quot;, to assist the song in blending in with the tour&#x27;s disco theme. On her 2008 Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour, she performed a mash-up of her 1990 hit &quot;Vogue&quot; with the instrumental of her recent single &quot;4 Minutes&quot;, to update it with the more urban sound of her &quot;Hard Candy&quot; album.

In August 2003, Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;Hollywood&quot; was remixed with &quot;Into the Groove&quot; and performed with Missy Elliott under the title &quot;Into the Hollywood Groove&quot; as part of a promotional campaign for clothing retailer GAP, prompting criticism for exploiting the underground culture of the mash-up for commercial gain.

The mid-2000s saw a massive surge in popularity for the mashup, including single releases that climbed high into the dance charts and even the mainstream top-40 charts. Such hits include Linkin Park and Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Numb/Encore&quot;, Party Ben&#x27;s &quot;Boulevard of Broken Songs&quot;, Alex Gaudino&#x27;s &quot;Destination Calabria&quot;, Mousse T. vs the Dandy Warhols&#x27; &quot;Horny as a Dandy&quot; (originally mixed and produced by Loo &amp; Placido) and Mylo vs Miami Sound Machine&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Pressure&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; by the Police was mashed up with &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; by Henry Mancini, for the 27th episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Mr. Ruggerio&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;. &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, which mashed up recordings by Jay-Z and the Beatles, also became notoriously popular.

With the release of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; in 2005, &quot;Rock Band&quot; in 2007, and those games&#x27; sequels, numerous mashup artists discovered that every song in the games had multitracks with instrument stems and acapellas, meaning that these songs could easily be sampled and kept uncompressed and clear. Among others, American comedian Neil Cicierega used this method to produce his four mashup albums, &quot;Mouth Sounds&quot;, &quot;Mouth Silence&quot;, &quot;Mouth Moods&quot; and &quot;Mouth Dreams&quot;.

DJ Earworm&#x27;s annual &quot;United States of Pop&quot; mashups became season events, with his 2009 edition alone garnering critical acclaim as well as racking up more than 53 million views on YouTube. Mashups also helped launch the careers of acts such as Girl Talk and Madeon, with the latter&#x27;s &quot;Pop Culture&quot; accruing more than 55 million views. Acts such as DJs from Mars and Mashd N Kutcher would go on to make mashups a huge part of their creative output.

Launched in San Francisco in 2003, Bootie was the first recurring club night in the United States dedicated solely to the burgeoning art form of the bootleg mashup, and as of 2019 hosted monthly parties in cities around the globe, including Los Angeles, Paris, Boston, Munich, and New York City. The party&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Music for the A.D.D. Generation&quot; also inspired the creation of &quot;A.D.D&quot;, Israel&#x27;s first mashup-dedicated party. The &quot;Best of Bootie&quot; mashup compilation series is produced by Bootie creators A Plus D. Released every December since 2005, the compilations are annual Internet sensations, with each album requiring 5,000 GB+ of download bandwidth.

Even though mashups mostly remained underground and barely got noticed aside from a few exceptions (notable examples include Bill McClintock), people have never stopped remixing other artists&#x27; music without getting their prior agreement. It&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to get noticed in the music industry due to a combination of relative obscurity and an increasing difficulty in keeping them available online due to automatic copyright detection (through Content ID) and cease and desist orders from the original artists.

== Video games ==
&quot;DJ Hero&quot; is a 2009 rhythm video game developed by Activision that includes over 90 pre-made mashups, where the player scores points by hitting notes on the turntable controller.

&quot;Fuser&quot; is a 2020 video game developed by Harmonix that allows the player to create mashups of over 100 songs, using four instrument stems from the master recording.

In December 2023, &quot;Fortnite&quot; introduced a new game mode titled &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot;. In the Jam Stage and &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, players can make mashups of over 100 songs.

<text>Gustave Charpentier (; 25 June 1860 – 18 February 1956) was a French composer, best known for his opera &quot;Louise&quot;.

==Life and career==
Charpentier was born in Dieuze, Moselle, the son of a baker, and with the assistance of a rich benefactor he studied violin at the conservatoire in Lille before entering the Paris Conservatoire in 1881. There he took lessons in composition under Jules Massenet (from 1885) and had a reputation of wanting to shock his professors. In 1887 he won the Prix de Rome for his cantata &quot;Didon&quot;. During the time in Rome that the prize gave him, he wrote the orchestral suite &quot;Impressions d&#x27;Italie&quot; and began work on the libretto and music for what would become his best-known work, the opera &quot;Louise&quot;.

Charpentier returned to Paris, settling in Montmartre, and continued to compose, including songs on texts by Charles Baudelaire and Voltaire. He eventually completed &quot;Louise&quot;, and it was accepted for production by the Opéra-Comique. A realistic portrait of Parisian working-class life, it is sometimes considered a French example of verismo opera.

The premiere of &quot;Louise&quot; on 2 February 1900 under the baton of André Messager was an immediate success. Soon this work was being performed all over Europe and America, and it brought Charpentier much acclaim. It also launched the career of the Scottish soprano Mary Garden, who took over the title role during an early performance. In late 1935 the composer supervised the abridged score used in a studio recording of around 70 minutes of the opera, conducted by Eugène Bigot. A film adaptation of the work followed in 1939 with Grace Moore in the title role. At the revival of &quot;Louise&quot; at the Opéra-Comique on 28 February 1950, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its creation and the 90th birthday of its composer, it was hoped that Charpentier himself might conduct the performance, but André Cluytens did so, with the composer conducting the &quot;Chant de l&#x27;apothéose&quot; after the third act.

&quot;Louise&quot; is still occasionally performed today, with the soprano aria &quot;Depuis le jour&quot; a popular recital piece.
In 1902, Charpentier founded the Conservatoire Populaire Mimi Pinson, intended to provide a free artistic education to Paris&#x27;s working girls. However, he became unproductive as a composer. He worked on a sequel to &quot;Louise&quot;, &quot;Julien, ou la vie du poète&quot;, but it was quickly forgotten after its tepidly received 1913 premiere. Thereafter, Charpentier wrote very little.

He was, nevertheless, no recluse. During World War I, he started the Œuvre de Mimi Pinson and Cocarde de Mimi Pinson to aid wounded soldiers. He was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1900, became a Commandeur in 1930, and a Grand Officier in 1950.
In 1934, he conducted a recording of his &quot;Impressions d&#x27;Italie&quot; with a Paris symphony orchestra. He died, aged 95, in Paris.

Charpentier&#x27;s brother Victor (also born in Dieuze, on 23 July 1867) was a cellist in the orchestra of the Paris Opera and later a conductor of popular symphony concerts in Paris. In 1931 Marc Delmas published a biography of Charpentier entitled &quot;Gustave Charpentier et le Lyrisme Francais&quot;.

<doc id="523808" wikidata="Q737558" url="?curid=523808" title="Kodachi">
<text>A , literally translating into &quot;small or short &quot;tachi&quot; (sword)&quot;, is one of the traditionally made Japanese swords (&quot;nihontō&quot;) used by the samurai class of feudal Japan. Kodachi are from the early Kamakura period (1185–1333) and are in the shape of a tachi. Kodachi are mounted in tachi style, but with a length of less than . They are often confused with wakizashi, due to their length and handling techniques. However, their construction is what sets the two apart, as kodachi are a set length while wakizashi are forged to complement the wielder&#x27;s height or the length of their katana. As a result, the kodachi was too short to be called a sword properly but was also too long to be considered a dagger, thus it is widely considered a primary short sword, unlike the tantō or the wakizashi which would act as a secondary weapon that was used alongside a longer bladed sword.

The exact use of the kodachi is unknown; it may have been a companion sword to normal sized tachi or it may have been a sword for an adolescent. Kodachi appear to have been produced only in a certain time period by specific schools of swordmakers.

<text>Get a Grip is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released in April 1993 by Geffen Records. &quot;Get a Grip&quot; was the band&#x27;s last studio album to be released by Geffen before they returned to Columbia Records.

&quot;Get a Grip&quot; featured guests including Don Henley, who sang backup on &quot;Amazing&quot;, and Lenny Kravitz, who offered backup vocals and collaboration to &quot;Line Up&quot;. As on &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; and &quot;Pump&quot;, this album featured numerous song collaborators from outside the band including: Desmond Child, Jim Vallance, Mark Hudson, Richie Supa, Taylor Rhodes, Jack Blades, and Tommy Shaw.

&quot;Get a Grip&quot; became Aerosmith&#x27;s best-selling studio album worldwide, achieving sales of over 20 million copies. The album became the band&#x27;s first album to reach number one in the United States and tied with &quot;Pump&quot; for their second best-selling album in the U.S., selling over 7 million copies as of 1995 (&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; leads with nine million). This also made it their third consecutive album with U.S. sales of at least five million. Two songs from the album won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, in 1993 and 1994. The album was voted Album of the Year by &quot;Metal Edge&quot; readers in the magazine&#x27;s 1993 Readers&#x27; Choice Awards, while &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; was voted Best Video.

==Production==
The album originally had 12 songs and was scheduled to be released in the third quarter of 1992, but Geffen A&amp;R executive John Kalodner listened to what had been recorded and thought it lacked variety and a radio-friendly song. So the band went back to write more songs with collaborators such as Child.

Regarding songs that reflect on the band&#x27;s history with drug abuse such as &quot;Get a Grip&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot;, Steven Tyler declared: &quot;We were saying you can point it back to some of those old beliefs about the crossroads and signing up with the devil, that you can look at the drugs as that: It can be fun in the beginning but then it comes time to pay your debt, and if you&#x27;re not sharp enough to see that it&#x27;s taking you down, then it really will get you.&quot;

Many songs were written and recorded for the album that were either used as B-sides or never released. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;Head First&quot; were released as B-sides, as well as &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Messin&#x27;&quot;, which also appears on several special editions of the album as an addition in the track list. Alternate versions of other songs recorded during the sessions including &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot;, &quot;Lizard Love&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Got a New Disguise&quot;, and &quot;Legendary Child&quot; have since been released on various albums and soundtracks.

Other songs were listed on the official Aerosmith website in the late 1990s. &quot;Black Cherry&quot;, &quot;Dime Store Lover&quot;, &quot;Meltdown&quot;, &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, &quot;Wham Bam&quot;, and &quot;Yo Momma&quot; were listed on the lyrics page of the website. In 2005, Kalodner confirmed the existence of several of these songs, as well as &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Strange&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, and &quot;Keep on Movin&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; was possibly recorded again during these sessions. Several songs are also listed on copyright repertoires, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Break My Heart&quot;, &quot;Good Thang&quot;, and &quot;Jake&quot;. These songs can be traced to the year 1991.

===Cover art===
&quot;Get a Grip&#x27;s&quot; cover art, depicting an image of a cow with a captive bead nipple ring through its udder and a brand of the Aerosmith logo, was designed by noted album-cover artist Hugh Syme. Music critic Steven Hyden has referred to the album&#x27;s cover art as &quot;the worst album cover ever&quot;, expressing surprise that Syme was responsible for it given his other work. An animal-rights group objected to the cover art, but the band confirmed the image had been digitally altered and did not depict an actual act of animal cruelty.

A special edition of the album was released in a fabric-covered case made to resemble cowhide.

==First digital download==
On June 27, 1994, Aerosmith became the first major artist to release a song as an exclusive digital download, making &quot;Head First&quot; available as a 4-megabyte WAV file to CompuServe subscribers. Around 10,000 users downloaded the song in the first few days, even though at the time, most users accessed the service with a modem, meaning the download would have taken the better part of an hour.
&quot;Head First&quot; was earlier used as the B-side for &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1993, Mark Coleman said he enjoyed the title song and compared the introductory track to the band&#x27;s 1986 rendition of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with Run–D.M.C. However, he found much of the rest unadventurous and too &quot;somber&quot;, negatively comparing &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; to a Bon Jovi song, and lamenting the outside contributions from songwriters and collaborators. Ultimately, Coleman determined that, &quot;for a spirited half-hour or so, Aerosmith pretty much gets over on sheer awe-inspiring technique&quot;. Robert Christgau was more positive in a contemporaneous review for &quot;Playboy&quot;, saying that while it &quot;occasionally exploits their rap connection&quot;, remains faithful to Aerosmith&#x27;s template of &quot;fast ones and slow ones; lyrically it&#x27;s fuck me and fuck you&quot;, but with such superpro crunch and commitment that no good-timing headbanger will give a shit. Christgau highlighted &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot; as &quot;the classic&quot; on the album, while saying that &quot;the closest thing to a duff cut [is] the &#x27;meaningful&#x27; Livin&#x27; on the Edge, which could be a hit anyway.&quot; He later ranked it 64th on his &quot;Dean&#x27;s List&quot; accompanying &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll of the year&#x27;s best albums, and assigned it an A-minus in his 2000 book &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

==Track listing==


*Immediately after &quot;Amazing,&quot; a snippet of &quot;Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well&quot;, by Lucky Millinder, is heard as if being tuned in on an old radio. Tyler says, &quot;So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night.&quot; The music then fades out.

<text>STS-60 was the first mission of the U.S./Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, and the 18th flight of Discovery, in which Sergei K. Krikalev became the first Russian cosmonaut to fly aboard a Space Shuttle. The mission used NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, which lifted off from Launch Pad 39A on February 3, 1994, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The mission carried the Wake Shield Facility experiment and a SPACEHAB module, developed by SPACEHAB Inc., into orbit, and carried out a live bi-directional audio and downlink link-up with the cosmonauts aboard the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===

== Mission highlights ==
After External Tank (ET) separation and main engine cutoff (MECO), a 2.5 minutes OMS burn was initiated at 12:52 UTC that circularized &quot;Discovery&quot;″s orbit from a orbit to . Shortly after liftoff, pilot Kenneth S. Reightler Jr. experienced problems with his portable headset. The problem was traced to the Headset Interface Unit (HIU) and that unit was swapped with a flight spare. The payload bay doors were opened and around 13:45 UTC the crew was given a go for on-orbit operations. Shortly after reaching orbit, the STS-60 crew began checking &quot;Discovery&quot;″s systems and activating the commercially developed SPACEHAB laboratory module and several of its experiments. The crew also activated one group of the payload bay Getaway Special (GAS) canisters.

SPACEHAB module experiments that were activated included the Organic Separations payload, which is designed to investigate cell separation techniques for possible pharmaceutical and biotechnology processing, and the Equipment for Controlled Liquid Phase Sintering Experiment (ECLiPSE) package, a furnace designed to explore the possibilities of creating stronger, lighter and more durable metals for use in bearings, cutting tools and electronics. SPACEHAB middeck experiments that were activated included Immune-1, which will look at the immune systems of rats in orbit, and the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth package, which is attempting to grow large, well- ordered protein crystals so that their structures can be more easily studied. The crew sleep period then began at 6:10 pm EST.

At 11:30 UTC on February 5, 1994, &quot;Discovery&quot; inadvertently flew through a cloud of wastewater ice crystals. Flight controllers determined that approximately one tablespoon of wastewater leaked out of a waste dump nozzle.

The Wake Shield Facility deployment operation was canceled on February 5, 1994. This delay was the result of several factors, including radio interference and an inability to read the Wake Shield Facility&#x27;s status lights when the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay is in full sunlight. Deployment originally was scheduled for 16:00 UTC, but after grappling the free-flyer and lifting it out of the cargo bay and into the pre-deploy position, crew members and investigators on the ground were unable to tell whether power and transmitter status lights were giving the proper indications. After determining that the problem was not a systems failure, but difficulty in reading the status lights, the crew and flight controllers prepared for another release attempt. Interference between the radio transmitter on the Wake Shield Facility and the receiver on its payload bay carrier resulted in a one-day delay.

Wake Shield Facility deployment was also canceled on February 6, 1994, during its orbit 53 opportunity at 17:25 UTC, WSF and flight controllers worked on problems with the Pitch and Roll sensors on WSF&#x27;s Attitude, Direction and Control system. Astronaut Jan Davis moved the wrist joint on the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm (Canadarm) to try to point WSF&#x27;s Horizon Sensor into the Sun in an attempt to warm up the sensor&#x27;s electronics package. The last deployment opportunity for on February 6, 1994, was a 50-minute window beginning at 19:23 UTC on orbit 54 but WSF was not ready. It was left mounted on the Canadarm during the crew sleep period while ground controllers considered their options. On its perch at the end of the RMS over night, WSF was able to grow 2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) thin films. The next deployment opportunity on February 7, 1994, would have been during orbit 67 but payload controllers and flight controllers determined that there would be insufficient time to safely develop contingency procedures in the event that WSF was unable to maintain stable attitude control without the use of its Horizon Sensor. It was decided that for the remainder of the mission, all WSF operations would take place at the end of the Canadarm and there would be no WSF free-flying operations on the mission.

On February 7, 1994, work had been progressing in the SPACEHAB-2 module on a number of experiments. These included the Three-Dimensional Microgravity Accelerometer (3-DMA) experiment, Astroculture experiment (ASC-3), Bioserve Pilot Lab (BPL), Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus experiment (CGBA), Commercial Protein Crystal Growth experiment (CPCG), Controlled Liquid Phase Sintering-Hab (ECLiPSE-Hab), Immune Response Studies Experiment (IMMUNE-01), Organic Separation experiment (ORSEP), Space Experiment Facility (SEF), Penn State Biomodule (PSB) and the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) Experiment. Sergei Krikalev had been operating the SAMS experiment.

At 12:38 UTC on February 8, 1994, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; performed a live bi-directional audio and downlink video hookup between astronauts on board &quot;Discovery&quot; and 3 cosmonauts on board the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; Space Station. &quot;Discovery&quot; was over the Pacific Ocean and &quot;Mir&quot; was over the southern United States. Afterwards, work progressed with SPACEHAB-2 module and middeck experiments while Wake Shield Facility continued operations at the end of the Canadarm. A slight problem developed with the status indicators on the 3-DMA experiment and the crew downlinked video to aid in troubleshooting. The astronauts ended Flight Day 6 at 00:10 UTC (February 9, 1994).

Flight Day 7 (February 9, 1994) began at 08:20 UTC. ODERACS operations were scheduled for 14:55 UTC during Orbit 97 and BREMSAT deploy was scheduled for 19:50 UTC. The WSF experiment was brought to an end and a telemetry problem with the facility prevented the growth of the 6th and final thin film on board WSF. Five other thin films were grown throughout the mission before Wake Shield Facility was berthed. WSF closeout was completed by 13:10 UTC. At 12:58 UTC, commander Charles F. Bolden reported to the ground that one of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) blankets around &quot;Discovery&quot;″s forward RCS thruster below Bolden&#x27;s cabin window was slightly peeled back. Jan Davis was directed to halt her power down and stowage of the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) and use the arm to perform a camera survey of the front left side of the orbiter. At 19:20 UTC, the BREMSAT satellite momentum wheel was spun up and BREMSAT was ejected into space at 19:23 UTC at the rate of .

On Flight Day 8 (February 10, 1994), the astronauts performed a number of operations to prepare &quot;Discovery&quot; for its trip home. These included Hot-Fire tests of all 44 Reaction Control Systems jets, Flight control system checkout, SAREX stow, CPCG Stow, ASC-3 Deactivation, ORSEP Deactivation, stowage of all non-essential cabin items and Ku-Band antenna stow. Flight Day 9 (February 11, 1994) operations included the powerup of all critical orbiter entry systems (Group B powerup), SAMS deactivation, CAPL Deactivation and De-Orbit preps. Ground controllers gave &quot;Discovery&quot; a go to start SPACEHAB deactivation at 13:00 UTC and this was complete by 15:20 UTC. Landing was at KSC runway 15 at 19:18:41 UTC.

<text>STS-62 was a Space Shuttle program mission flown aboard . The primary payloads were the USMP-02 microgravity experiments package and the OAST-2 engineering and technology payload, both in the orbiter&#x27;s cargo bay. The two-week mission also featured a number of biomedical experiments focusing on the effects of long duration spaceflight. The landing was chronicled by the 1994 Discovery Channel special about the Space Shuttle program and served as the show&#x27;s opening. A C.F. Martin backpacker guitar was also flown aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; during the mission.

==Crew==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==

===Day 1===

Flight Day One (Friday, March 4) consisted of ascent operations and reconfiguration of the orbiter in order to support orbital operations, an OMS-2 burn to circularize &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s orbit to a orbit, USMP-2 activation, PSE operations, APCG activation, CPCG operations, RMS checkout, DEE operations, CGBA activation. The payload bay doors were opened at 10:26 am EDT.

===Day 2===
On Flight Day Two (Saturday, March 5), the astronauts took turns on the crew cabin exercise facility in an effort to slow down the effects of muscle atrophy. Pilot Andrew M. Allen and mission specialist Charles D. Gemar also spent time in the Lower Body Negative Pressure Container. Mission specialists Pierre J. Thuot and Marsha S. Ivins started the Protein Crystal Growth Experiment (PCGE) and the Physiological Systems Experiment (PSE), while scientists on the ground in the Payload Operations Control Center controlled eleven other experiments mounted in the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay. Mission controllers in Houston also investigated a problem in a fuel line pressure sensor on one of &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s three Auxiliary Power Units (APUs). Higher than normal pressures were detected and then returned to normal after engineers powered up heaters on the unit. The APUs provided hydraulic power to operate key landing systems and only one of the three was needed for a successful landing. However, flight rules called for a shortened mission in the event a single unit was lost.

===Day 3===
On Flight Day Three (Sunday, March 6), following a morning of medical studies, the crew spent the last half of the day exercising and continuing to study the behavior of a space station truss model in weightlessness. Pilot Allen and mission specialists Ivins and Gemar each took a turn on a stationary bicycle mounted in &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s middeck. The stationary bike had long been a staple of shuttle flights to allow exercise that countered the effect of weightlessness on the muscles. The bike aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;, however, featured a new mounting system of shock-absorbing springs that was evaluated as a method of keeping vibrations from exercise, which could disturb sensitive experiments, to a minimum.

Also, Gemar set up a model of a scaffold-like truss structure that could be applied to a future space station design in the lower deck. The model, linked to sensitive recorders in a shuttle locker, was used to determine the characteristics of such structures in orbit. The model and its reactions were studied in several different configurations during the day.

Other activities for the crew included photography of the glow created as the orbiter&#x27;s outer skin interacted with atomic oxygen in orbit, and continued monitoring of protein crystal growth experiments in the cabin.

Although not highly visible except to the Earth-bound scientists watching over them, &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s wide assortment of external payloads continued their investigations throughout the day. The second United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-2) experiments continued to produce a wealth of data for scientists on the ground.

The Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment, or ZENO, science team reported that they expected to locate the critical temperature of xenon at &quot;any time.&quot; Team members closely watched computer data traces which indicate their experiment was very near the critical temperature—the goal of a lengthy, methodical &quot;sensitive&quot; search process. This was a more precise search for the critical temperature after its location had been determined within a narrow band. Once the temperature was located, the team spent nearly 24 hours taking a good look at the phenomenon they waited years to see. They studied the properties of xenon at its critical point, taking subtle optical measurements in the region surrounding it. A fluid&#x27;s &quot;critical point&quot; occurs at a condition of temperature and pressure where the fluid is simultaneously a gas and a liquid. By understanding how matter behaves at the critical point, scientists hope to gain a better insight into a variety of physics problems ranging from phase changes in fluids to changes in the composition and magnetic properties of solids.

The Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) continued to measure the microgravity environment on the USMP-2 carrier in support of the four other experiments on board. The SAMS team began sending results of their data collection during various orbiter activities to the crew, as they were interested in how they could minimize their influence on the microgravity environment. Measurements were made with the system at specific times when microgravity disturbances were caused by events such as crew exercise and movement of the orbiter&#x27;s Ku-band antenna. Such observations also collected &quot;signatures&quot; which the team were able to easily identify in future data.

A related system, the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), was managed by NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center. It was useful on missions such as USMP-2 where it was important to accurately characterize a wide variety of disturbances in the microgravity environment. Working closely with SAMS, the OARE recorded any low-frequency activity such as the orbiter&#x27;s friction with the rarefied upper atmosphere. SAMS was most suitable for recording higher-frequency activity such as crew exercise.

The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE) continued to assemble data to test theories concerning the effect of gravity-driven fluid flows on dendritic solidification of molten materials. Upon completion of its first phase of pre-programmed operations the previous night, the dendritic experiment entered its second phase of crystal growth when team members began sending commands to their experiment from the ground using a unique set of capabilities known as &quot;telescience.&quot; This allowed them to get the best possible data from their investigation.

The Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF) studied the directional solidification of semiconductor materials in microgravity. Downlinked experiment data from the third day of the mission indicated that solidification of a crystal of mercury cadmium telluride took place, and the AADSF science team constantly monitored this slow but steady progress. Testing the AADSF in microgravity was beneficial because on Earth, gravity causes fluids to rise or fall within the melted portion; a warm liquid is less dense than a cool one and will rise to the top of the melt. These convective movements of molten material contribute to physical flaws in the internal structure of the growing crystal. Such flaws affect a crystal&#x27;s overall electrical characteristics, and consequently, its usefulness in electronic devices.

The MEPHISTO team reported that they had gathered good data with their directional solidification furnace. During the day, the team troubleshooted a problem discovered on the previous night with a troublesome &quot;Seebeck measurement.&quot; This electronic signal measured changes in the microstructure of a solidifying metal, and was conducted on one of three experiment samples of bismuth-tin. Other measurement techniques were used on the two remaining samples later in the mission; both these samples operated nominally.

Flight controllers had a quiet Sunday in Mission Control with no significant troubles seen aboard the spacecraft. A reading of high pressure that was seen in a fuel line to one of the shuttle&#x27;s three auxiliary power units earlier in the flight had dissipated, and controllers became confident the APU would operate well if needed. However, they continued to closely watch the readings from that area. The crew began eight hours of sleep at 4:53 pm.

===Day 4===
Flight Day 4 began on Monday, March 7 at 12:53 am. The crew started its day with a medley of armed forces anthems sung by the U.S. Military Academy Glee Club. The medley honored all four branches of the service which were represented by the STS-62 crew. During the time of the mission, Commander Casper was a colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Pilot Allen a major in the U.S. Marine Corps, mission specialist Gemar a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, and mission specialist Thuot was a commander in the U.S. Navy.

After completing their post-sleep activities, the crew started the payload work for the day. The crew performed checks of the Protein Crystal Growth Experiment and the rodents that were housed in the middeck as part of the Physiological Systems Experiment. Gemar also continued his work with the Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment, designed to study the fundamental, non-linear, gravity-dependent behavior of hybrid scaled structures. Understanding these structures became important for designers of large space structures such as the International Space Station.

Casper conducted a special presentation about the Space Acceleration Measurement System. A frequent flyer on the shuttle, SAMS used accelerometers to take measurements of on-board vibrations and accelerations. Such disturbances, though slight, could have affected the sensitive microgravity experiments. SAMS measurements allowed scientists to adjust their experiments to improve their scientific results.

Allen and Gemar got a half-day off from their busy schedule operating the many microgravity experiments on the mission. Due to the long duration of the mission, each crew member received two half-days off during the 14-day mission.

The other astronauts spent the first half of the day working with the Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment, or MODE, and a model of a truss structure which was under consideration for use on a future space station. The truss model, set up to float free in the middeck, was analyzed to determine its behavior in weightlessness.

Around the clock, experiments with the U.S. Microgravity Payload-2, the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2, the Space Shuttle Backscatter Ultraviolet instrument and the Limited Candidate Duration Materials Exposure experiments continued to operate, many of them being controlled by scientists on the ground. The SSBUV instrument operated since the first day of the flight, and plans were made by its ground controllers on Flight Day 4 to attempt to detect sulfur dioxide emissions from volcanoes in Central America. The objective of the observations by SSBUV were to investigate whether such emissions low in the atmosphere were detectable from orbit. SSBUV&#x27;s measurements in general were used to fine-tune satellites that monitored the ozone and other gases in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The crew began its eight-hour sleep period at 4:53 pm EST.

During USMP-2 operations on Flight Day 4, the Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment, or ZENO, team reported overnight that they started seeing behavior in the fluid xenon unlike any they had seen on Earth. They believed this meant the experiment had passed through the xenon sample&#x27;s critical point. Meanwhile, the team continued their delicate temperature manipulations in order to verify what they had seen. Once the team was certain they had located the critical point, they planned to conduct a series of precise measurements in the area surrounding it using laser light scattering. When xenon is at or extremely near its critical point—the point where it is simultaneously a liquid and a gas—patches of the otherwise clear substance briefly take on a &quot;milky&quot; iridescence. Closer to the critical point, the milky-white areas are larger and exist for longer periods. When a laser light is passed through the sample in these areas, fluctuations in the sample&#x27;s density cause the light to be scattered.

Team members for the MEPHISTO furnace began running a series of metal solidification studies and received analyzable data. On Monday, the team made much progress in overcoming some difficulty they had been experiencing with one of the experiment&#x27;s electronic measurements and successfully completed a Seebeck run. The Seebeck measurement is an electrical signal which measures temperature variations during crystal growth at the boundary where liquid becomes solid—the solidification front. MEPHISTO was used to conduct a series of melting and solidification cycles on three identical rod-shaped samples of a bismuth-tin alloy. During these runs, temperature, velocity and shape of the solidification front were measured in order to study the behavior of metals and semiconductors as they solidified.

Team members of the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE), said they were pleased with the performance of their apparatus and the data they acquired during USMP-2. While dendrite growth was taking place, two 35 mm cameras took photographs for post-mission analysis. When a dendrite growth cycle was completed, the small crystalline structure was re-melted and another grown at a different &quot;supercooling&quot; temperature. Dendrites were grown at 20 different levels of supercooling ranging up to approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius. Supercooling is the slow cooling of a liquid to below its normal freezing point, but due to its purity, does not solidify. The level of supercooling is determined by the difference between the temperature of the liquid and its normal freezing point. IDGE was a fundamental materials science experiment performed in the microgravity environment of space in order to increase understanding of the solidification processes.

The Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF) continued to operate smoothly, growing a single cylinder-shaped crystal of mercury cadmium telluride, an exotic material used as an infrared radiation detector. The AADSF provided scientists with a unique apparatus in which to test theories of semiconductor crystal growth without the effects and limitations caused by Earth&#x27;s gravity. The information gained by growing crystals of a semiconductor material in microgravity can be used to study the physical and chemical processes of many materials and systems. A greater understanding in these areas could aid researchers in the discovery of processes and materials that perform better and cost less to produce.

The crew was awakened at 11:53 pm for the start of Flight Day Five activities. The middeck payloads took center stage as the STS-62 crew worked through the second half of its fifth day on orbit. Allen and Gemar took turns in the Lower Body Negative Pressure Unit, each turn lasting an hour and 45 minutes. The sack-like device sealed at the waist so that pressure around the lower body could be gradually decreased. The lowered pressure drew body fluids down to the legs and lower torso, similar to the body&#x27;s normal state on Earth. The LBNP protocol underwent testing as a countermeasure to a condition known as &quot;orthostatic intolerance&quot;, in which a person feels lightheaded after standing. Some astronauts experienced such sensations upon standing after shuttle landings. Allen and Gemar also performed a 45-minute ramp test, but at the direction of ground controllers, terminated the test 40 seconds early. Casper, Thuot and Ivins relaxed on board &quot;Columbia&quot; for the first half of the day.

===Day 5===
On Flight Day 5 (Tuesday, March 8) &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s crew continued a daily regimen of daily exercise, photography and monitoring the progress of crystal growth and bioprocessing experiments aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;.

Meanwhile, ground-based researchers remotely operating experiments in &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s payload bay continued their observations. Scientists working with the Space Shuttle Backscatter Ultraviolet instrument continued probing the layers of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and recorded data on tropospheric emissions from Mexican and Central American volcanoes; sulfur dioxide from industrial by-products in the troposphere above China and Japan; and observations in the mesosphere above the Mexican volcano Colima.

Among the experiments of the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2 package, materials being designed for future spacecraft in the SAMPIE experiment were exposed to the orbital environment for the first time. Results included the operation of an advanced solar energy cell and plasma interactions with various materials while the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay was pointed toward Earth.

Other OAST-2 accomplishments included ten freeze and thaw cycles of a new cooling technology for future spacecraft; spectrometer readings of airglow phenomena in the upper atmosphere with the EISG instrument; and studies of the orbiter&#x27;s interaction with atomic oxygen using the SKIRT instrument.

Three members of the crew had a half-day off (Casper, Thuot, Ivins), and all of the crew would receive one more half-day off before the mission concluded on March 18. &quot;Columbia&quot; operated well with few problems encountered by the crew or Mission Control. The spacecraft remained in an orbit with a high point of and a low point of . The crew began eight hours of sleep at 2:53 pm CST and awakened at 10:53 pm CST to start a sixth day in space.

===Day 6===
On Flight Day 6, (Wednesday, March 9) the crew members devoted their time to the secondary experiment housed in &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s middeck. Gemar returned to his work with the Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment. Allen took time from his day to talk with reporters in Cleveland, Ohio; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Knoxville, Tennessee. Prior to his interview, Allen discussed the medical tests that the crew performed before, during, and after the flight. The astronauts collected blood and urine samples to help researchers determine the chemical regulatory changes the human body undergoes while in space. Pre- and post-flight tests studied the crew members&#x27; gait, steadiness while standing and exercise capacities.

Other crew members checked on the protein crystal growth experiments, performed some Auroral Photography experiments and checked the orbiter windows for any debris impacts. Later on Flight Day 6, the crew exercised using the Shuttle&#x27;s ergometer.

Spacelab Mission Operations Control at the Marshall Space Flight Center reported the second United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-2) completed yet another day of successful operations in orbit aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;.

On the previous day, scientists with the Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment, or ZENO, concluded that they had indeed pinpointed the location of the long-sought-after critical point of xenon. For the next 24 hours, a series of subtle optical measurements were planned to be made in the area surrounding this phenomenon where the xenon behaved as both a liquid and a gas.

In the materials science field, the Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF) continued to grow a single crystal of mercury cadmium telluride in the microgravity environment of the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay. The AADSF scientists said that telemetry from their experiment indicated crystal growth proceeded &quot;exceptionally well.&quot;

After several days of successfully growing crystalline dendrites in microgravity, team members for the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE) reported that they were very pleased with the performance of the IDGE as well as the number and quality of the dendrites grown so far during the mission. The IDGE experimenters continued to monitor slow-scan video images of dendrites growing in their apparatus in order to maximize the efficiency of the instrument and the science results.

The Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) continued to provide a running account of vibrations aboard the Shuttle to the other USMP-2 experiment teams. It recorded detailed measurements to characterize how smooth and stable a platform &quot;Columbia&quot; is providing for the experiments.

===Day 7–8===
On Flight Day 7 (Thursday, March 10), Casper informed Allen that he was selected for promotion from Major in the US Marine Corps to Lt. Colonel.

On Flight Day 8 (Friday, March 11), marking the midpoint of the mission, Casper switched several of the environmental control systems to their backups for on-orbit check out. The procedures required crew members to switch to the alternate humidity separator, cabin pressure and temperature control systems, orbiter heaters, and carbon dioxide removal system.

&quot;Columbia&quot; also changed attitudes for the first time since launch day. &quot;Columbia&quot; orbited with its tail pointing toward the Earth and the payload bay pointing in the direction of travel or the &quot;ram&quot; position. With the maneuver, Casper closed and opened sample trays for the Long Duration Space Environment Candidate Material Exposure (LDCE) experiment. The LDCE consisted of three identical sample plates with 264 samples of various materials used in space vehicles. One of the sample plates was exposed to the space environment for most of the mission. Another was exposed only when the payload bay was pointing in the ram position – or pointing into the direction of travel – and a third only when the orbiter was not in the ram position.

Mission specialist Ivins was interviewed by students at the Bronx High School of Science. The students asked a variety of questions about the microgravity experiments being conducted during the mission on living and working in space.

Also, Gemar and Allen each completed 45-minute ramp tests in the lower body negative pressure unit, and performed more tests with the Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment. Astronauts also performed the standard checks of the protein crystal growth and rodent experiments housed in Columbia&#x27;s middeck.

Flight controllers in Houston put the finishing touches on a plan to uplink more digital video to the crew on Flight Day 9. The plan required procedural changes on the ground, but no action by the crew. The STS-62 crew began its sleep shift on time at 1:53 pm CST, and was scheduled to be awoken at 9:53 pm CST to begin its ninth day of orbit operations.

===Day 9===
On Flight Day 9 (Saturday, March 12) plan called for operations of the Auroral Photography Experiment, the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth experiment and the Limited Duration Space Environment Candidate Exposure (LDCE) experiment. During the latter part of the day on Saturday, the crew unlatched the Remote Manipulator System and used it to help troubleshoot some off-nominal reception from the Experimental Investigation of Spacecraft Glow instrument in the payload bay. The arm&#x27;s end effector camera was used to get a birds-eye view of EISG in operation.

===Day 10===

On Flight Day 10 (Sunday, March 13), the crew enjoyed a relatively light day of work, taking the first half of the day off, and spending the second half working with middeck experiments.

During an in-flight news conference, the crew responded to questions ranging from budget cutbacks and safety, to experimentation and life on the then-future International Space Station. Activities in the Mission Control Center focused on preparing, reviewing and uplinking messages outlining changes to the crew&#x27;s scheduled activities for Flight Day 11. The crew began its standard eight hour sleep shift a little before 2 pm and was scheduled to wake up at 9:53 pm CST.

===Day 11===
The Flight Day 11 (Monday, March 14) plan called for two OMS burns, OMS-3 of 37.9 ft/s (11.6 m/s) at MET 9/17:44 to lower the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit to , and an OMS-4 of 31.8 ft/s (9.7 m/s) at MET 9/18:34 to lower the orbit even further to a orbit.

Awakened for their tenth day in space to the song &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; performed by the group Yes, &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s crew started the day by lowering the Shuttle&#x27;s orbit by about and shifting the focus of science on board to the second major goal of the flight.

Experiments and observations in the cargo bay focused on the interaction of the orbiter with atomic oxygen, nitrogen and other gases in orbit, an interaction that caused a well-known glowing effect around the surfaces of the spacecraft. The lower orbit increased the effect, and instruments with the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2 (OAST-2) package took center stage for the rest of the mission.

Early in the morning, Casper and Allen fired &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s Orbital Maneuvering System engines twice to descend from a high orbit to a circular orbit. Shortly thereafter, observations by OAST-2 began with a three-minute release of nitrogen gas from a canister in the cargo bay and a study of its effect on the glow of a special plate, constructed of materials to be used on future satellites. Later, &quot;Columbia&quot;, with tail pointed toward Earth, performed a 25-minute-long series of 360-degree spins to allow observations by OAST-2&#x27;s Spacecraft Kinetic Infrared Test instrument. Such observations by both instruments set the pace for the ensuing days of the flight.

Ivins and Gemar each took a turn evaluating a tracking system for &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s RMS. Part of the Dexterous End Effector (DEE) experiment, the system used a mirror near the end of the arm, flashing light-emitting diodes, a cargo bay camera and a portable computer to assist an astronaut in finely aligning the arm. The Dexterous End Effector (DEE) experiment also looked at the forces generated by arm movements when its magnetic end effector was engaged. The forces were recorded by a force torque sensor that was also part of the DEE equipment. Each crew member also took a turn at exercise as had been the daily routine during the long-duration flight.

The astronauts continued to work with these experiments for the remaining part of their day, and began an eight-hour sleep period at 1:53 pm CST and awakened at 9:53 pm. On its 159th orbit, &quot;Columbia&quot; was in excellent condition and flight controllers noted no new problems with the spacecraft&#x27;s systems.

As payload cameras showed the Earth vista from up, the crew sent a special goodnight message—the Bette Midler song &quot;From a Distance&quot; – for the people watching over them from below in Houston.

The message came at the end of a busy 11th day of on-orbit operations that featured a shift in focus from United States Microgravity Payload-2 to work with the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2 (OAST-2) package.

===Day 12===
The Flight Day 12 (Tuesday, March 15) plan called for Gemar and Allen to spend another hour and 45 minutes in the LBNP, the operation of the Dexterous End Effector (DEE) experiment, and the Experimental Investigation of Spacecraft Glow (EISG) experiment. The crew was awakened to the song &quot;View From Above&quot;, written and performed by Allison Brown, who was inspired to write the song by Ivins. &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s crew spent the first half of their 12th day in space evaluating new technologies for the Shuttle&#x27;s RMS.

Ivins, Thuot and Gemar took turns operating the arm as part of the DEE experiment. The crew gave good reviews to the technology during the morning, testing it by using the 50 foot (15 m) long arm to insert pins into sockets that had progressively smaller clearances, ranging from of clearance for the loosest to for the tightest. Later, a foot (300 mm) wide flat beam was inserted into a slot and then moved back and forth to correlate readings by the force sensor, technology that also was highly complimented by the crew.

While DEE operations progressed on the flight deck, Gemar and Allen each had one ramp session in the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) device.

The Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2 payload took center stage among the scientific investigations in the payload bay. The crew cooperated with investigators of the Experimental Investigation of Spacecraft Glow instruments, positioning the robot arm&#x27;s camera above its sample plate in between DEE runs. A low-light camera in the payload bay that was supposed to have recorded the effects of gaseous nitrogen releases and their effect on shuttle glow failed earlier in the mission.

The Space Shuttle Backscatter Ultraviolet instruments in the payload bay also continued to take readings that were used to help calibrate free-flying satellites that continually monitored the ozone content of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The crew began an eight-hour sleep shift at 1:53 pm CST, and were awakened at 9:53 pm CST. About 2:08 am CST, a fifth Orbital Maneuvering System burn was planned in order to lower the perigee of &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s orbit to for additional spacecraft glow measurements.

===Day 13===
The Flight Day 13 (Wednesday, March 16) plan called for another orbit change, an OMS-5 burn of 56.6 ft/s (17.3 m/s) at MET 11/18:08 which was planned to lower the orbit to . Also included was more work with the DEE experiment, a waste water dump and operation of both the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) and the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment.

Casper and Allen started out their 13th day in orbit with an eye toward the trip home, performing a standard check of the orbiter systems used for entry and landing.

For the first part of the morning&#x27;s flight control systems checkout, the crew used APU 3, one of three units that supplied power for the spacecraft&#x27;s hydraulic systems during launch and landing. APU 3, which had been the subject of scrutiny early in the mission due to high pressure readings in a fuel line, operated normally during the checkout.

Following the checkout, the crew fired &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s Orbital Maneuvering System engines for 38 seconds, dropping one side of their orbit by about to the lowest orbital altitude of any Shuttle flight to that date. &quot;Columbia&quot; was then placed in an elliptical orbit with a high point of and a low point of . The lower orbit was required for continuing observations of the glowing effect created as the Shuttle interacted with atomic oxygen and other gases in low orbit.

During the first shuttle glow observations in the new orbit, Thuot reported the glowing effect was much more pronounced at the lower altitude. The crew also activated the Limited Duration Candidate Materials Exposure, or LDCE, experiment, exposing materials to the low-orbit environment that were under study for use on future spacecraft.
The crew also began another series of evaluations of the Dexterous End Effector equipment using the RMS, testing the technology&#x27;s magnetic grapple system, alignment system and force sensor.

The crew was awakened by the song &quot;Traveling Prayer&quot; performed by Billy Joel.

===Day 14===
The Flight Day 14 (Thursday, March 17) plan called for a hot firing of the Reaction Control System (RCS) in preparation for the return flight, flight control system checkout, cabin stowage, SSBUV deactivation, and a final run in the Lower Body Negative Pressure device for Gemar. The crew was awakened for the 14th day of the flight to the song &quot;Living in Paradise&quot; by the Brothers Cazimero.

The crew performed final checks of their spacecraft, wrapped up their experiments and began packing their bags in preparation for the return to Earth. &quot;Columbia&quot; was scheduled to fire its OMS engines at 6:18 am CST to begin a descent that would culminate with a touchdown on the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility runway at 8:09 am EST. Casper and Allen test-fired &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s 38 primary steering jets early that morning as planned, finding them all in good shape for the trip home. Later, Casper and Allen each spent time practicing landings using a portable computer simulation designed for the Shuttle. During this time, Gemar spent four hours in the Lower Body Negative Pressure Device (LBNP).

Ivins powered down &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s mechanical arm and latched it in its cradle for the trip home, and Thuot completed operation of the two protein crystal growth experiments on board, preparing them for entry and landing.

Several final observations of the Shuttle glow effect, a phenomenon created as atomic oxygen and other gases impact the spacecraft, were conducted. &quot;Columbia&quot; performed another series of spins for the investigations that included more releases of nitrogen gas from payload bay canisters.

The final few hours of the crew&#x27;s day were devoted to stowing gear and preparing &quot;Columbia&quot; for the mission&#x27;s end. Before reentry, &quot;Columbia&quot; was in an orbit with a high point of and a low point of .

The Flight Day 15 (Friday, March 18) plan called for deorbit preps and a deorbit burn of 209 ft/s (63.7 m/s) at MET 13/22:04 with a planned landing at KSC. Landing occurred on Runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility on March 18, 1994 at approximately 8:10 am EST.

===9 April===
&quot;Endeavour&quot; began its sixth mission on the morning of 9 April 1994, with an on-time launch at 7:05 am Eastern time. Soon after, the six astronauts began activating the sensitive radar equipment in the payload bay that would be operated around the clock during the next ten days.

By 8 pm, the Space Radar Laboratory-1 experiments of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth were all activated and began their study of the earth&#x27;s ecosystem.

STS-59 ground controllers finished activating the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) and began processing its first images of the Earth, while engineers working with the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) worked their way through some initial activation problems.

Meanwhile, the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument took data on the carbon monoxide content and distribution in the atmosphere since shortly after launch.

During the initial activation of the X-SAR, controllers reported they were unable to fully power up the amplifier that provides power to the radar. The problem was in the low voltage circuit internal to the power amplifier. Engineers were not immediately able to explain the problem, so they turned off the power amplifier for about three hours. The problem was traced to an oversensitive protection circuit, a type of circuit breaker. The radar lab engineers bypassed the protection circuit and turned on the instrument at about 4:20 pm Saturday. It worked without incident, completing 100 percent of its scheduled observations overnight.

Thereafter, X-SAR controllers continued a deliberate, step-by-step check of the instrument, and successfully bounced X-band radar pulses off the Earth and recorded data. All of the instrument&#x27;s circuits recorded normal readings. The crew also activated Space Tissue Loss investigations on the middeck, and the Getaway Special experiments in the cargo bay.

===10 April===
As of Sunday morning, 10 April 1994, the radar laboratory had taken data readings on more than 40 targets including Howland, Maine; Macquarie Island; the Black Sea; Matera, Italy; and the Strait of Gibraltar. Scientists also gathered information on three of 19 &quot;supersites,&quot; the highest priority targets for that day. Sunday&#x27;s supersite observations were global carbon and hydrologic cycles in Duke Forest, North Carolina; hydrologic cycles around Ötztal, Austria; and geological data on Lake Chad in the Sahara. Observation sites for Sunday afternoon included Gippsland, Australia; Sable Island; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Bermuda; Bighorn Basin, Wyoming; Chung Li, China; and Mammoth Mountain, California. The supersite opportunities were Raco, Michigan and the Gulf Stream.

Sunday evening&#x27;s supersite observations by SIR-C and X-SAR focused on the interaction of plants and animals in the ecology of the forests of Raco, Michigan; hydrologic cycles around Bebedouro, Brazil; tectonic plate activity around the Galapagos Islands in the South Pacific; and the transfer of heat through wave energy in the Southern Ocean.

The Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution from Satellite instrument also continued to take readings of the concentration and distribution of carbon monoxide throughout the troposphere. Crew members reported good earth observation photography opportunities over the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the frozen lakes of the Raco supersite area, as well as fires in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico.

On flight day two, the Red Team crew of Commander Gutierrez, Pilot Chilton and Linda M. Godwin began its sleep shift about 5 pm Central time, to awaken at 2 am The Blue Team crew members, Jay Apt, Michael R. Clifford and Thomas D. Jones, awakened about 4 pm to begin their third flight day on orbit, and would go to bed about 5 am

===11 April===
As of Monday, 11 April 1994, 6:30 am Central time, three real-time radar images were downlinked from &quot;Endeavour&quot; overnight. A view of the Sahara Desert in Algeria, one of the geology sites, was taken to help scientists map surface and subsurface structures, including drainage patterns.

Also, the two radar imaging systems were calibrated over Matera, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, near Munich, in collaboration with students from the University of Munich. The students measured soil moisture, forestry parameters, and the biomass of agricultural crops in the area at the same time the radar data was gathered.

Thomas D. Jones gave scientists real-time observations of thunderstorms over Taiwan, the Philippines and New Guinea to augment data being gathered by the (MAPS) experiment. Jay Apt described a &quot;good-sized&quot; dust storm on the northwest coast of Australia.

The MAPS project&#x27;s Vickie Connors reported to &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s Red Team that there was good correlation between what the instruments on board were reading compared to data gathered on the ground.

Concluding Flight Day 3, the Blue Team started their sleep period beginning about 8 am The Red Team went to work a few minutes after five that morning.

By Monday, 11 April 1994, 6 p.m. CDT, several more real-time images were processed by X-SAR – Sahara Desert, a geology site and the area around the Japanese Archipelago. &quot;Endeavour&quot; flew over the southern portion of Japan, and the quick-look processor showed oil slicks.

Monday&#x27;s radar work included calibration passes over Palm Valley, Northern Territory in Australia, and the Amazon forests of Brazil; oceanography observations over the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Gulf Stream, the Southern Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico; ecology observations over Altona, Manitoba, Canada; geology observations over the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming; hydrology studies of Mammoth Mountain, California, and geology studies of the tectonic activity around the Galapagos Islands of the southeastern Pacific.

Linda M. Godwin reported good photography of &quot;tremendous&quot; thunderstorms over South America and ocean wind patterns around the Galapagos. She also reported three Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment contacts with students at Ealy Elementary School in West Bloomfield, Michigan, Country Club School in San Ramon, California, and Boy Scouts in Richardson, Texas.

The crew reported air bubbles in the water supply for &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s galley.

===12 April===
On Tuesday, 12 April 1994, 3 a.m. Eastern time a real-time image was downlinked from the X-SAR showing a region of the Andes Mountains in Bolivia.

During the Blue Team&#x27;s shift, the X-SAR and SIR-C collected images of oceanography sites including the South Pacific Ocean, the East Australian Ocean currents, and the North Atlantic Ocean; geology sites at Cerro Laukaru, Chile, snow cover at Otztal, in the Austrian Alps, and Ha Meshar, Israel; and ecology sites at Howland, Maine, and Duke Forest, North Carolina.

The Red Team began their work about 7 am EDT on Tuesday 12 April 1994. Gutierrez and Chilton slept in an extra hour because they were about an hour and a half late going to sleep the night before after working on an in-flight maintenance procedure to eliminate air bubbles that were collecting in the drinking and food preparation water. The astronauts connected the water dispensing hose directly to the supply tank, bypassing the galley water outlet. A later test during the Blue Team&#x27;s shift indicated that bubbles still may get into the drink bags through the opening where water goes into the drink container.

During this shift, live X-SAR moving images were downlinked of the area surrounding Sarobetsu, Japan, one of the high-priority calibration sites for the X-band antenna. Scientists on the ground measured the strength of the radar signal and the size of the swath being imaged.

Ground investigators also were developing topographic maps of Japan and searching for the optimum way in which to use the three radar antennas for mapping rice fields.

X-SAR&#x27;s quick-look processor also showed images of the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the land around Veracruz, Mexico. Ground investigators were taking simultaneous measurements of the ecological test site, looking for soil and vegetation information during the dry season of the tropical forest there.

Godwin reported that the crew had a cloud-free opportunity to photography Chickasha, Oklahoma, one of the 19 &quot;supersites,&quot; and that they had seen sea ice along the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia.

===13 April===
On Wednesday, 13 April 1994, 7 a.m. Eastern time, the Blue Team completed its fifth working day in space with a handover to the Red Team.

During the Blue shift, researchers watched televised downlinks of live X-SAR moving images of surface and subsurface structures in the Namib Desert in South Africa to improve researchers&#x27; understanding of radar backscatter. Scientists also viewed radar images of sea ice and seasonal melt in the Sea of Okhotsk off the coast of Siberia and a critical region of expanding drought in the Sahel area of the Sudan.

At about 2:45 am Central time while &quot;Endeavour&quot; passed over Australia, Jay Apt exchanged greetings with the Russian cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; as the two spacecraft passed within 1,200 nautical miles () of each other above Australia. Both crews used amateur radio equipment for the contact which was monitored real-time by many amateur radio stations via telebridge systems and rebroadcasts.

All three Blue Team astronauts exercised on the bicycle ergometer during their work shift for an ongoing biomedical study of exercise as a possible countermeasure for the deconditioning which astronauts experience in their cardiovascular systems during space missions.

Rich Clifford had off-duty time for the second half of his work day. Also, an in-flight maintenance procedure to install a makeshift seal for drink bags and food containers at the galley water dispenser helped reduce bubbles in the drinking and food preparation water.

At 10:30 am, Red Team crew members were on duty for their fifth shift of the mission. The crew reported good photography opportunities over Manitoba, Canada, saying the lakes appeared more &quot;bluish&quot; than anticipated.

Gutierrez was interviewed by CNBC&#x27;s Tom Snyder and Clifford will answer questions from Mutual Radio Network listeners during an interview for the &quot;Jim Bohannon Show&quot; at 11:15 pm central.

===14 April===
On Thursday, 14 April 1994, 3:30 am Central Time, Rich Clifford answered listeners&#x27; questions about space flight, mission objectives, and the quality of life aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; during a 20-minute interview on Mutual Radio Wednesday night.

The Blue Team reported good photography of a gigantic fire-scarred area in China that burned in 1987. This region was of special interest to the Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution experiment for studies of forest regrowth after a fire event.

Jay Apt had off-duty time for the first half of the Blue Team&#x27;s sixth work day in space. During his off-duty time, Apt exercised on the bicycle ergometer and recorded his heart rate and perceived exertion for biomedical investigators. Apt was back on duty at 1 am central time.

The X-SAR science team&#x27;s quick-look data processor produced moving video images of the Chickasha site, starting just north of the Oklahoma border in Kansas and ending just south of the Oklahoma River in Texas. Hydrologists studied the data to learn how well the radar is able to determine the soil moisture content as it fluctuates from day to day and week to week.

===15 April===
On Friday, 15 April 1994. Tom Jones commented that the pollution cloud noted over Manila Bay in the Philippines on flight day six was almost invisible today. At about 1:50 am central time, Jones reported that the astronauts had seen fires along the west coast of Burma and smoke over Tasmania.

One of the instruments aboard, MAPS, exhausted its supply of infrared film.

At 6 pm CDT, Chilton explained to the public how a vast network of ground scientists and students camped in the field at many of the worldwide sites assist with the radar observations, and Godwin answered questions supplied by CNN viewers around the world.

The crew was continuing to work on a nuisance with it galley, the presence of bubbles in the water used for drinking and rehydrating food.

===16 April===
On Saturday, 16 April 1994, at about 11:30 pm and again at 1:15 am central time, Jay Apt used &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s Shuttle Amateur Radio to talk with fellow astronauts Norm Thagard and Bonnie Dunbar and two Russian cosmonauts at the Star City training center outside Moscow.

The Blue Team—Jay Apt, Rich Clifford and Tom Jones—reported several visual observations including fires burning in Africa and a line of thunderstorms over northeastern Brazil. Payloads scientists asked the crew to add the Rügen Island, off Germany&#x27;s northern coastline in the Baltic Sea, to their list of Earth observations photography.

On Saturday, 16 April 1994, 12:30 p.m.CDT, the Space Radar Lab-1 instruments also were continuing to operate well, and all observations were being made on schedule.

The sites being observed this day include areas of Japan and Italy. All of the observation sites have been recorded at least once at this point in the flight, and remaining observations are to supplement the data already obtained.

The annoyance that was present since the first day of the flight has been laid to rest with the successful in-flight maintenance procedure to get rid of air bubbles in the crew&#x27;s water supply.

Godwin spent 15 minutes being interviewed by television reporters in Atlanta and Nashville.

===17 April===
On Sunday, 17, 3 April a.m. Central time, the Blue Team was recording radar images for scientists studying how elements of Earth&#x27;s land surfaces, water resources, and plant and animal life work together to create Earth&#x27;s life-sustaining environment.

On Sunday, 17, 12 April:30 pm Central time, &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s flight control surfaces and thruster jets were checked out to ensure they were in good working order for planned landing at the Kennedy Space Center.

On this day, two weeks after Easter Sunday (in the Gregorian Calendar) three of the astronauts - Gutierrez, Chilton and Jones - took part in a Roman Catholic service of Holy Communion. They paused for a moment of reflection and then received consecrated communion wafers brought aboard in a golden pyx.

The mission&#x27;s six astronauts held their traditional in-flight news conference answering questions about the significance of the mission. Following the news conference, Commander Sid Gutierrez, Pilot Kevin Chilton and Flight Engineer Rich Clifford checked the orbiter systems while the payload crew of Mission Specialists Linda Godwin, Jay Apt and Tom Jones documented activity with the payload.

===18 April===
On Monday, 18 April 1994, 2 p.m. Central time, &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s crew were starting to pack up while final radar observations of earth were made and STS-59 wound down, aiming toward a 10:52 am central landing Tuesday.

The weather forecast was favorable for a landing in Florida, although flight controllers were watching a possibility of low clouds and a slight chance of showers in the area.

===19 April===
On Tuesday, 19 April 1994, 11:30 am Clouds and high winds in the vicinity of the Kennedy Space Center require &quot;Endeavour&quot; and its six astronauts to remain in space an additional day.

Following the wave off, the crew reconfigured the orbiter systems for the added day on orbit and reactivated a portion of the Space Radar Laboratory payload in the cargo bay. The Space Imaging Radar system (SIR-C) was the only part of the payload to be reactivated.

The data recorded during the STS-59 mission would fill the equivalent of 20,000 encyclopedia volumes. Payload managers reported that more than 70 million square kilometers of the Earth&#x27;s surface, including land and sea, have been mapped on this flight. This figure represents about 12 percent of Earth&#x27;s total surface. The Space Radar Laboratory obtained radar images of approximately 25 percent of the planet&#x27;s land surfaces.

===20 April===

On Wednesday, 20 April 1994, &quot;Endeavour&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California, completing its successful 11-day mission at 9:54 am.

<text>256 (two hundred [and] fifty-six) is the natural number following 255 and preceding 257.

==In mathematics==
256 is a composite number, with the factorization 256 = 28, which makes it a power of two.
* 256 is 4 raised to the 4th power, so in tetration notation, 256 is 24.
** 256 is the value of the expression formula_1, where formula_2.
* 256 is a perfect square (162).

<text>STS-65 was a Space Shuttle program mission of &quot;Columbia&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 8 July 1994. The flight carried a crew of 7 and was commanded by Robert D. Cabana who would go on later to lead the Kennedy Space Center. STS-65 was an international science mission that carried the International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) on a 15-day mission which featured the first animals (Japanese rice fish) to conceive and bear offspring in space. Columbia returned to the Kennedy Space Center on 23 July 1994.

==Mission highlights==
The International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) was the second in a series of Spacelab (SL) flights designed to conduct research in a microgravity environment. The IML concept enabled a scientist to apply results from one mission to the next and to broaden the scope and variety of investigations between missions. Data from the IML missions contributed to the research base for the space station.

As the name implies, IML-2 was an international mission. Scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA), Canada, France, Germany and Japan collaborated with NASA on the IML-2 mission to provide the worldwide science community with a variety of complementary facilities and experiments. These facilities and experiments were mounted in twenty 19&quot; racks in the IML 2 Module.

Research on IML-2 was dedicated to microgravity and life sciences. Microgravity science covers a broad range of activities from understanding the fundamental physics involved in material behavior to using those effects to generate materials that cannot otherwise be made in the gravitational environment of the Earth. In life sciences research, a reduction of gravitation&#x27;s effect allows certain characteristics of cells and organisms to be studied in isolation. These reduced gravitational effects also pose poorly understood occupational health problems for space crews ranging from space adaptation syndrome to long-term hormonal changes. On IML-2, the microgravity science and life sciences experiments were complementary in their use of SL resources. Microgravity science tends to draw heavily on spacecraft power while life sciences places the greatest demand on crew time.

Life Sciences Experiments and facilities on IML-2 included: Aquatic Animal Experiment Unit (AAEU) in Rack 3, Biorack (BR) in Rack 5, Biostack (BSK) in Rack 9, Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Program (EDOMP) and Spinal Changes in Microgravity (SCM) in the Center Isle, Lower Body Negative Pressure Device (LBNPD), Microbial Air Sampler (MAS), Performance Assessment Workstation (PAWS) in the middeck, Slow Rotating Centrifuge Microscope (NIZEMI) in Rack 7, Real Time Radiation Monitoring Device (RRMD) and the Thermoelectric Incubator (TEI) both in Rack 3.

Microgravity experiments and facilities on IML-2 included: Applied Research on Separation Methods (RAMSES) in Rack 6, Bubble, Drop and Particle Unit (BDPU) in Rack 8, Critical Point Facility (CPF) in Rack 9, Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) in Rack 10, Free Flow Electrophoresis Unit (FFEU) in Rack 3, Large Isothermal Furnace (LIF) in Rack 7, Quasi Steady Acceleration Measurement (QSAM) in Rack 3, Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) in the Center Isle, and Vibration Isolation Box Experiment System (VIBES) in Rack 3.

Other payloads on this mission were: Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility (APCF), Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG), Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) Calibration Test, Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), Military Application of Ship Tracks (MAST), Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II). Columbia flew with an Extended Duration Orbiter (ED0) pallet and no RMS Arm was installed. This was also the 1st flight of the payload bay door torque box modification on &quot;Columbia&quot; and the 1st flight of new OI-6 main engine software.

==Mission overview==

The second in the series of International Microgravity Laboratory payloads (IML-2) was launched on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s STS-65 mission on 8 July 1994. After remaining in orbit around the Earth for 15 days, the Shuttle landed on 23 July. The seven-member crew included a Japanese astronaut, Chiaki Mukai, who was the first Japanese woman in space.

Besides NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the space agencies of Japan (NASDA), Canada (CSA), Germany (DLR), and France (CNES) sponsored experiments on the mission. Investigators from a total of 13 countries participated in research into the behavior of materials and life in microgravity.

The IML-2 payload consisted of more than 80 experiments in microgravity and life sciences, including five life science experiments developed by American researchers. Of these, Ames Research Center sponsored two experiments using newts and jellyfish. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) sponsored the PEMBSIS experiment, designed to study plant embryogenesis in microgravity.

==Life Sciences Research Objectives==

An experiment featuring Japanese rice fish sought to examine their mating behavior in microgravity.
The objective of the newt experiment was to study the early development of gravity-sensing organs (see figure). The utricle and saccule are specialized organs present in the inner ears of all vertebrate animals. They contain otoliths (or otoconia), calcium carbonate stones, which are deposited on a gelatinous membrane that lies over the sensory hair cells. The pull that gravity exerts on the otoliths is sensed by the hair cells, and information about the gravitational stimulus is transmitted to the brain via connecting nerve fibers. The experiment was designed to determine whether otolith production and development of otolith-associated receptor cells and nerve fibers may be altered in the microgravity environment of space.

The jellyfish experiment was designed to study behavior and development in space. Behavioral parameters studied included swimming, pulsing, and orientation. Study of developmental processes focused on gravity-sensing organs. The experiment also sought to determine the level of artificial gravity stimulus needed to counteract any negative effects of space flight.

The objective of the plant embryogenesis (PEMBSIS) experiment was to evaluate whether space flight affected the pattern and developmental progression of embryonic daylilies from one well-defined stage to another. It also examined whether cell division (mitosis) and chromosome behavior were modified by the space environment.

==Life Sciences Payload==

===Organisms===
Four adult Japanese rice fish (2 males and 2 females) were included in the Aquatic Animal Experiment Unit, with an oriented light to help them find the correct posture for mating in the absence of gravity. The fish successfully mated and laid eggs. 8 eggs hatched in orbit, producing 8 healthy fry and another 30 eggs hatched after returning to Earth. 5 eggs never hatched, although this reflected an expected hatching rate for this species. This experiment therefore featured the first vertebrates to conceive and produce offspring in space.

Adults and larvae of the Japanese Red-Bellied Newt species (&quot;Cynopus pyrrhogaster&quot;) were used in the newt experiment. This species was selected for study partly because the vestibular system of very young newts undergoes most of its development in a period of time equivalent to the planned mission duration. Furthermore, adult females can be induced to lay eggs by injecting them with a hormone. Their eggs develop in orbit and mature in the microgravity environment to provide scientists with a sample of embryos that have undergone early development in microgravity.

Moon Jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) served as experiment subjects for the jellyfish experiment. Both the sedentary polyp stage and the free-swimming ephyra stage of the jellyfish were studied.

The PEMBSIS experiment studied embryogenically competent daylily (Hemerocallis cv. Autumn Blaze) cells.

===Hardware===
Newt adults and larvae were housed in cassette-type water tanks in the Aquarium Package within the Aquatic Animal Experiment Unit (AAEU), developed by NASDA, the Japanese space agency. The AAEU is a life support unit that can keep fish or other aquatic animals alive for at least 19 days in the Spacelab. It consists of a Main Unit, an Aquarium Package, and a Fish Package, each of which has an independent life support system. In IML-2, each cassette held an egg container with individual egg holes (6-mm diameter, approximately 12 mm deep).

A slow rotating centrifuge microscope and camera system, Nizemi, developed by DLR (formerly DARA), the German space agency, was used to examine and videotape the behavior of the jellyfish ephyrae and polyps at up to 15 varying levels of G and at a temperature of 28 °C (to facilitate swimming activity). The Nizemi provides observation of samples under variable acceleration levels between 10–3 and 1.5 G and a controllable temperature between 18 and 37 °C.

Jellyfish were housed in the European Space Agency&#x27;s Biorack facility within Biorack Type I containers. For descriptions of the facility and containers, see IML-1.

A Refrigerator/Incubator Module (R/IM) held fixed jellyfish specimens. The R/IM is a temperature-controlled holding unit flown in the Shuttle middeck that maintains a cooled or heated environment. It is divided into two holding cavities and can contain up to six shelves accommodating experiment hardware. An Ambient Temperature Recorder (ATR-4) was placed inside the R/IM. For a general description of the ATR-4, see IML-1.

The PEMBSIS experiment used hardware provided by the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan. As part of the NASDA Life Science Cell Culture Kit, this experiment used six petri-dish-like Plant Fixation Chambers (PFCs). The PFCs were used to hold the cultured plant cells for the PEMBSIS experiment. These containers are completely sealed. The PFCs allow plant cells exposed to space flight to be fixed in orbit by insertion of a chemical fixative via syringe through a septum port.

==Operations==

===Preflight===
PEMBSIS cell cultures were prepared about a week before launch. Twelve chambers were filled with a semi-solid medium. Six were transported to KSC and kept in an unlit incubator at 22±2 °C until they were loaded into the Shuttle. The other six were used as ground controls.

Approximately 36 hours before launch, 148 prefertilized newt eggs were loaded into the three cassettes of the AAEU. Four adult newts were also loaded into the cassettes; two cassettes each contained one newt apiece, while a third contained two. Fresh, aerated water at 24 °C circulated continuously through the unit. A similar unit was maintained at KSC as a ground-control.

Twenty-four hours before launch, four groups of six jellyfish polyps each were given iodine in artificial sea water (ASW) to induce strobilization of polyps into the ephyrae form.

Shortly before flight, the jellyfish samples were loaded into a total of 10 Nizemi cuvettes containing ASW and placed in Type I containers. For the behavior study, a group of normal ephyrae and a group of ephyrae without statoliths were placed in the Biorack 22 °C incubator. The third group of ephyrae was placed in the Biorack 1-G centrifuge. Two groups of polyps were used for the development study. One group was placed in the incubator and the other was placed in the 1-G centrifuge. A similar set of equipment was maintained at the KSC ground-control facility.

===Inflight===
The Ambient Temperature Recorder (ATR-4) is a self-contained, battery-powered instrument, approximately the size of a deck of cards. It may be placed in almost any environment (not submersible in liquid) to provide recording of up to four channels of temperature data.
On flight days 6, 8, and 11, the crew carried out video observations of newt eggs to document the rate of development. The crew also made observations of the adult newts at specified times. On both the fifth and ninth days of flight, an adult newt was found dead, causing the loss of some eggs because of contamination. The remaining two adult newts survived the flight and were recovered live upon landing.

One cuvette from each group of jellyfish ephyrae and polyps were videotaped on the rotating microscope/centrifuge at intervals throughout the mission to determine the G-threshold for the swimming behavior of the ephyrae. On flight day five, both the flight and ground-control groups of ephyrae with statoliths that had been hatched on Earth were fixed. On flight day 13, two of the four groups of polyps that had been strobilation-induced were fixed. The remaining ephyrae and polyps were returned to Earth for postflight analysis.

To provide a comparison between flight-fixed and ground-fixed groups in the PEMBSIS experiment, the crew fixed some cultures shortly before landing. The fixative was a three-percent glutaraldehyde (balance water) solution. Each chamber was fixed with a 20-ml injection of fixative.

===Postflight===
The flight cassettes containing the newts were retrieved approximately six hours after landing. Some of the larvae were fixed and preserved for later analysis, while some were tested to estimate how space flight affected the gain of the otolith-ocular reflex and measure the otolith volumes and areas of associated sensory epithelia.

Living jellyfish were counted, coded, and photographed beginning at five hours postflight. The pulse rate, numbers of arms, rhopalia, and statoliths were counted in each of the ephyrae. Those with abnormal pulsing were videotaped after landing and again approximately 24 hours later. Some of both the flight and control jellyfish were allowed to form clones, which were then examined for arm number and other structural differences.

After the PEMBSIS cell culture chambers were recovered from the Shuttle, specimens of living cells and somatic embryos were photographed, counted, and chemically fixed within nine hours of landing, before their first division cycle on Earth was complete. Chromosomes were measured and compared within and among cultures.

==Results==

===Newt Study===
According to morphogical analysis, both flight and ground controls developed at the same rates. Analysis of three-dimensional reconstructions showed that flight-reared larvae had a larger mean endolymphatic sac (ES) and duct volume and a larger average volume of otoconia within the sac when compared to similarly staged ground controls. Furthermore, the appearance of otoconia in the ES was greatly accelerated in the larvae reared in microgravity.

===Jellyfish Study===
Ephyrae that developed in microgravity had significantly more abnormal arm numbers as compared with 1-G flight and ground controls. As compared to controls, significantly fewer ephyrae that developed in space swam when tested postflight. Polyps budding in space produced more buds and were developmentally ahead of ground controls. Although development through budding and through metamorphosis proceeded well in space, some jellyfish are apparently more sensitive to microgravity than others, as evidenced by their abnormal arm development.

===Daylily Cell Study===
Cytological changes and chromosomal aberrations were seen in both flight-fixed and ground-fixed flight cells. A substantial number of binucleate cells, cells possessing two nuclei, were also found in the flight samples. The ground-control samples were all uninucleate.

==Newts==

At least two of the four adult newts died on the voyage. The first newt death was attributed simply to stress. The second dead newt was found by Donald A. Thomas late on Sunday 17 July 1994 while checking the tanks, however the second death was called &quot;peculiar&quot; in a comment by Dr. Michael Wiederhold, a scientist on the ground. At the time it was said it would be difficult to remove the newt from the tank because of weightlessness, but the dead animal could contaminate the tank if left inside. The newts were Japanese Red-bellied Newts (&quot;Cynops pyrrhogaster&quot;).

<text>STS-64 was a Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; mission that was set to perform multiple experiment packages. It was Discovery&#x27;s 19th flight. STS-64 was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 9 September 1994, and landed back on 20 September 1994 at Edwards Air Force Base.

==Crew==
=== Spacewalks ===
* Lee and Meade – EVA 1
*EVA 1 Start: 16 September 1994 – 14:42 UTC
*EVA 1 End: 16 September 1994 – 21:33 UTC
*Duration: 6 hours, 51 minutes

==Mission highlights==

STS-64 marked the first flight of Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) and the first untethered U.S. extravehicular activity (EVA) in 10 years. LITE payload employs lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, a type of optical radar using laser pulses instead of radio waves to study Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The first spaceflight of lidar was a highly successful technology test. The LITE instrument operated for 53 hours, yielding more than 43 hours of high-rate data. Unprecedented views were obtained of cloud structures, storm systems, dust clouds, pollutants, forest burning and surface reflectance. Sites studied included atmosphere above northern Europe, Indonesia and the south Pacific, Russia and Africa. Sixty-five groups from 20 countries made validation measurements with ground-based and aircraft instruments to verify LITE data. The LITE science program was part of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth. 

Mission Specialists Lee and Meade completed the 28th EVA of the Space Shuttle program on 16 Sept. During the six-hour, 15-minute EVA, they tested a new backpack called Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), designed for use in event crew member becomes untethered while conducting an EVA. Operations with SAFER marked the first untethered EVA since STS 51-A in 1984, and also the last such EVA of the program. SAFER went on to become a mainstay of US and joint spacewalks during the assembly of the International Space Station and beyond.

On the fifth day of the mission, the Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy-201 (SPARTAN-201) free flyer was released using the Remote Manipulator System arm. Making its second flight on the Shuttle, SPARTAN-201 was designed to collect data about the acceleration and velocity of the solar wind and to measure aspects of the Sun&#x27;s corona. Data was recorded for playback after return to Earth. SPARTAN-201 was retrieved after two days of data collection.

Other cargo bay payloads: Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX), a long instrumented extension for Shuttle robot arm. SPIFEX designed to collect data about orbiter Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to aid understanding about potential effects of thruster plumes on large space structures, such as &quot;Mir&quot; space station or the planned international space station. The Robot Operated Processing System (ROMPS) was the first U.S. robotics system operated in space, mounted in two Get Away Special (GAS) canisters attached to the cargo bay wall. A GAS bridge assembly in the cargo bay carried 12 cans, 10 holding self-contained experiments.

Middeck experiments included: Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) experiment to investigate effects of spaceflight on plant specimens; Military Application of Ship Tracks (MAST) to take high-resolution imagery of ship tracks and to analyze wake formation and dissipations; Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) to supply information on flame propagation over fuels in space; Radiation Monitoring Equipment III (RME III) to measure ionizing radiation; Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment II (SAREX II) to demonstrate feasibility of short-wave radio contacts between orbiter and ground-based amateur radio operators; and Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS) test, which required no onboard hardware.

STS-64 was the first mission to see the use of the new full-pressure Advanced Crew Escape Suit, which eventually replaced the partial-pressure Launch Entry Suit.

<text>Welcome to the Monkey House is a collection of 25 short stories written by Kurt Vonnegut, published by Delacorte in August 1968. The stories range from wartime epics to futuristic thrillers, given with satire and Vonnegut&#x27;s unique edge. The stories are often intertwined and convey the same underlying messages on human nature and mid-twentieth century society.

The story &quot;Der Arme Dolmetscher&quot; is listed in the book&#x27;s copyright notice as being included in this collection, but it was ultimately omitted, and does not appear in any edition of &quot;Welcome To The Monkey House&quot;. It does appear in Vonnegut&#x27;s later collection &quot;Bagombo Snuff Box&quot;.

==Adaptations in other media==
In 1970, Christopher Sergel adapted the collection of stories into a play, also called &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;. The play was staged at Carolina Actors Studio Theatre in 2010. In 1991, a short-lived television series titled &quot;Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s Monkey House&quot; aired on the United States Showtime channel. It was based on Vonnegut&#x27;s stories and hosted by Vonnegut himself.

&quot;Who Am I This Time?&quot; was made into a 53-minute television movie in 1982 starring Christopher Walken and Susan Sarandon and directed by Jonathan Demme.

The story &quot;D.P.&quot; has been adapted to screen twice. Vonnegut co-wrote the first adaptation, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen&quot;, which aired on October 5, 1958, as part of the Ronald Reagan-hosted television anthology series &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. The episode starred Sammy Davis Jr. The second adaptation, &quot;Displaced Person&quot;, aired on May 6, 1985, as part of the television anthology series &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, meeting with critical success. The episode was directed by Alan Bridges and starred Stan Shaw, and won an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s program&quot; for its producers, including Barry Levinson.

&quot;Deer in the Works&quot; was made into a 25-minute short film in 1980 by Barr Films. It starred Dennis Dugan as David Potter as well as a cast that included Richard Kline, Gordon Jump, Bob Basso and Bill Walker. It was written by Brent Maddock and S. S. Wilson and directed by Ron Underwood.

==References in popular culture==
* &quot;Happiness By The Kilowatt&quot;, a song by Canadian post-hardcore band Alexisonfire, makes several references to &quot;The Euphio Question&quot;.
* The Philadelphia-area based hardcore/post-hardcore band This Day Forward included a mostly instrumental song called &quot;Euphio Question&quot; on their 2003 release &quot;In Response&quot;.
* American hardcore band Snapcase has a song titled &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Progression Through Unlearning&quot;.
* American rock band The Dandy Warhols&#x27;s fourth studio album is called &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;.
* The character Mae rather appropriately picks up a copy of &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; in the film &quot;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&quot;

==Other short story collections==
*This collection includes all but one of the twelve stories in Vonnegut&#x27;s previous short story collection &quot;Canary in a Cat House&quot;, published in 1961. 
*Other short stories Vonnegut wrote during the same time period are collected in a second anthology, &quot;Bagombo Snuff Box&quot;, published in 1999.

<text>The Pournelle chart, developed by Jerry Pournelle in his 1963 political science Ph.D. dissertation, is a two-dimensional coordinate system which can be used to distinguish political ideologies. It is similar to the political compass and the Nolan Chart in that it is a two-dimensional chart, but the axes of the Pournelle chart are different from those of other systems. The two axes are as follows:

* The x-axis, &quot;Attitude toward the State&quot; (labeled statism), refers to a political philosophy&#x27;s attitude toward the state and centralized government. The furthest right is &quot;state worship&quot; and the furthest left represents the state as the &quot;ultimate evil&quot;, preferring individual freedom.
* The y-axis, &quot;Attitude toward planned social progress&quot; (labeled rationalism), refers to the extent which a political philosophy is compatible with the idea that social problems can be solved by the use of reason. The top indicates complete confidence in planned social progress and the bottom represents skepticism of such methods, often considering them as naively utopian. Those at the top of the axis would tend to discard a traditional custom if they do not understand what purpose it serves (considering it antiquated and probably useless), while those at the bottom would tend to keep the custom (considering it time-tested and probably useful).

Pournelle arranged American liberalism, socialism, and communism, in the upper right-hand quadrant of high state control and high rationalism. Conservatism, fascism, and Nazism are placed in the lower right-hand quadrant of high state control and low rationalism. Classical anarchists are in the lower left-hand corner of low state control and low rationalism. Libertarians (including anarcho-capitalists) and Objectivists are placed in the upper left-hand corner of low state control and high rationalism. Each diagonal axis contains natural political allies.

<doc id="523836" wikidata="Q17096451" url="?curid=523836" title="Slip knot">
<text>The slip knot is a stopper knot which is easily undone by pulling the tail (working end). The slip knot is related to the running knot, which will release when the standing end is pulled. Both knots are identical and are composed of a slipped overhand knot, where a bight allows the knot to be released by pulling on an end; the working end for a slip knot, and the standing end for a running knot. The slip knot is used as a starting point for crochet and knitting.

==Standard creation==


The slip knot is formed by first creating a loop in the shape of a &quot;p&quot;. Place a hand or hook through the loophole and grab a bight on the working end. Draw this bight through the first loop. Seat the knot and pull the bight until a small loop is created.

<doc id="523841" wikidata="Q84181" url="?curid=523841" title="Giovanni Antonio Scopoli">
<text>Giovanni Antonio Scopoli (sometimes Latinized as Johannes Antonius Scopolius) (3 June 1723 – 8 May 1788) was an Italian physician and naturalist. His biographer Otto Guglia named him the &quot;first anational European&quot; and the &quot;Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire&quot;.

==Biography==
Scopoli was born at Cavalese in the Val di Fiemme, belonging to the Bishopric of Trent (today&#x27;s Trentino), son of Francesco Antonio, military commissioner, and Claudia Caterina Gramola (1699-1791), a painter from a patrician family from Trentino. He obtained a degree in medicine at University of Innsbruck, and practised as a doctor in Cavalese and Venice. Much of his time was spent in the Alps, collecting plants and insects, of which he made outstanding collections.

He spent two years as private secretary to the bishop of Seckau, and then was appointed in 1754 as physician of the mercury mines in Idrija, a small town in the Habsburg realm, remaining there until 1769. In 1761, he published &quot;De Hydroargyro Idriensi Tentamina&quot; on the symptoms of mercury poisoning among mercury miners. 
Scopoli spent time studying the local natural history, publishing &quot;Flora Carniolica&quot; (1760) as well as a major work on the insects of Carniola, (1763). He also published a series of &quot;Anni Historico-Naturales&quot; (1769–1772), which included first descriptions of birds from various collections.

In 1769, Scopoli was appointed a professor of chemistry and metallurgy at Mining Academy at Schemnitz (now Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia), and in 1777 transferred to the University of Pavia. He became a bitter rival of Lazzaro Spallanzani, who was accused of stealing specimens from the Pavia museum. Spallanzani was tried and the prolonged trial resulted in acquittal. Shortly thereafter, Scopoli died of a stroke. His last work was &quot;Deliciae Flora et Fauna Insubricae&quot; (1786–1788), which included scientific names for birds and mammals in northwestern Italy described by Pierre Sonnerat in the accounts of his voyages.

Scopoli corresponded with Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist who laid the foundations of modern taxonomy. Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse, two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected him and showed great interest in his work. Because of a great distance, they never met.

Scopoli is frequently mentioned by Gilbert White in his &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;.

==Works==

* &quot;Flora Carniolica&quot; (1760): a flora of Carniola, part of modern-day Slovenia

** : A revised second edition of the first elaborate description of the flora of Carniola, undertaken when Scopoli lived in Idrija. It has 66 plates engraved by J. F. Rein after original drawings by Scopoli. Whereas the unillustrated first edition of 1760 of 600 pages had no binary names for the plant species, this edition has binary names and is written in the Linnaean tradition in all other respects as well.

Bianchi (1783–1784): The chemist Joseph Macquer&#x27;s Dictionnaire de chymie, the first dictionary of theoretical and general chemistry was written it in haste and concerned about his reputation, Macquer published it anonymously in 1766. Its huge success prompted the preparation of a revised second edition (1778). Then Scopoli translated and extensively augmented it. A second edition of the translated work, without further additions was published in Venice in 1784–1785.
*&quot;Deliciae Flora et Fauna Insubricae Ticini&quot; (1786–1788): an account including new descriptions of the birds and mammals collected by Pierre Sonnerat on his voyages.

<text>Lawn darts (also known as Javelin darts, jarts, lawn jarts, or yard darts) is a lawn game for two players or teams. A lawn dart set usually includes four large darts and two targets. The gameplay and objective are similar to those of both horseshoes and darts. The darts are typically 12 inches (30 cm) in length with a weighted metal or plastic tip on one end and three plastic fins on a rod at the other end. The darts are intended to be tossed underhand toward a horizontal ground target, where the weighted end hits first and sticks into the ground. The target is typically a plastic ring, and landing anywhere within the ring scores a point.

Starting in the late twentieth century, the safety of metal-tipped lawn darts was called into question in several countries. After thousands of injuries and at least three children&#x27;s deaths were attributed to lawn darts, the sharp-pointed darts were banned for sale in the United States and Canada. They are still legal in the European Union.

==Rules==

The game may be played with standard or Handly Cup rules. Either variation can be played one-on-one or by teams of two. In the team versions, the players stand with one member from each team at each end (they should be sure to stand well back when the other side is throwing) and toss the darts to a target about away (with variation based on the players&#x27; skill and the location of the game).

In standard gameplay, points are scored when a dart lands in the target area. Usually if players from both teams land darts in the target, the scores cancel each other. For example, if Team A lands two darts in the target area and Team B lands one, Team A would get one point and Team B would get zero. Some versions of lawn darts include a smaller bullseye ring for additional points.

With the Handly Cup style, scores are based on darts in the ring plus darts closer to the ring than any of the opposing team&#x27;s darts. Darts landing inside the ring, or &quot;ringers&quot;, are worth three points each, and can be canceled by darts thrown by opponents that also land in the ring. Any dart that is closer to, but outside, the ring than any other dart thrown by the opposing team is worth one point. This means that if neither team managed to place a dart into the ring, but Team A landed two darts closer than did any of Team B&#x27;s darts, Team A would score two points. If Team A landed one dart in the ring, and one dart closer than any of Team B&#x27;s darts, Team A would score four points. If both teams land darts in the ring, it is impossible for a dart outside the ring to score any points, as it is further from the ring than the opposing team&#x27;s dart that is inside. If Team A and Team B each land a dart inside the ring, and Team A also lands a dart outside the ring, but closer to the ring than Team B&#x27;s other dart, neither team would score any points for the round. Handly Cup style matches are typically played by teams of two, with the pairs alternating until one team&#x27;s total score is 21 or more. For a point to count, the dart must stick into the ground.

==Safety and bans in the U.S. and Canada==

In the year 1970, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified sharp-pointed lawn darts as a &quot;mechanical hazard,&quot; a designation which prohibited the sale of lawn darts, unless the darts satisfied three requirements: (1) Be packaged with specified warning label that advised of the potential for serious injury and cautioned parents to keep the product out of the reach of children, (2) Include instructions on usage with warnings to avoid use when other persons or animals are within the field of play, and (3) Not be sold in toy stores or toy departments. The Consumers Union and the Children&#x27;s Foundation petitioned the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), a different agency, to go further, asking that HEW use the emergency provisions of the Child Protection and Toy Safety Act of 1969 to ban outright, in addition to several other toys, &quot;outdoor games with 13‐inch pointed darts weighing more than five ounces each.&quot; When HEW refused, Consumers Union sued, seeking a judicial order instructing HEW to enact the ban; on December 18, 1970, a federal judge held in favor of HEW.

On April 5, 1987, seven-year-old Michelle Snow was killed by a lawn dart thrown by one of her brothers&#x27; playmates in the backyard of their home in Riverside, California, when the dart penetrated her skull and caused massive brain trauma. The darts were purchased as part of a set of various lawn games and were stored in the garage, never having been played before the incident occurred. Snow&#x27;s father David began to advocate for a ban on lawn darts, claiming that there was no way to keep children from accessing lawn darts short of a full ban. As a partial result of Snow&#x27;s lobbying, on December 19, 1988, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission introduced an outright ban on lawn darts in the U.S. In the previous eight years, 6,100 Americans had visited hospital emergency rooms as the result of lawn dart accidents. Of that total, 81% were 15 or younger, and half were 10 or younger. During the week when the commission voted to ban the product, an 11-year-old girl in Tennessee was hit by a lawn dart and fell into a coma. In 1997, the CPSC issued a reminder on the ban after a 7 year-old boy in Elkhart, Indiana was injured by a dart in an old lawn dart set, which had pierced his skull, and warned parents to dispose of old sets.
In Canada, lawn darts caused at least 55 serious injuries. They were banned for sale in the country from July 1989. The sale of second-hand lawn darts is also illegal under the Hazardous Products Act. Since then, alternatives have surfaced that are available for sale in Canada and are made of plastic. As of 2024, a modified, safer version of lawn darts with a blunt-tip design may be purchased in the United States.

<doc id="523853" wikidata="Q1347897" url="?curid=523853" title="He, She and It">
<text>He, She, and It (retitled Body of Glass in the United Kingdom) is a 1991 cyberpunk novel by Marge Piercy. It won the Arthur C. Clarke Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1993. The novel&#x27;s setting is post-apocalyptic America and follows a romance between a human woman and a cyborg created to protect her community from corporate raiders. The novel also interweaves a secondary narrative of the creation of a golem in 17th century Prague. Like Piercy&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot; (1976), &quot;He, She, and It&quot; also examines themes such as gender roles, political economy, and environmentalism. In the mid-twenty-first century, Norika (formerly North America) is a toxic wasteland. Dominated by powerful corporations known as &quot;multis,&quot; the region includes environmental domes, independent &quot;free towns,&quot; and the chaotic &quot;Glop,&quot; where most Norikans live in violent, polluted conditions ruled by gangs and warlords.

==Plot summary==
The story of &quot;He, She and It&quot; takes place in North America in the year 2059. The economic and political power is held by a few &quot;multis&quot;—huge multinational enterprises with their own social hierarchies, that are able to produce an affluent society. However, the main part of the population lives in the &quot;glop&quot; outside of the multis&#x27; enclaves within an environment that has mainly been destroyed. There, life is dominated by poverty, gang wars, and the law of the strongest. An exception to this is the so-called free towns that are able to sell their technologies to the multis but remain autonomous. Communication is handled via a network that allows the participants to project themselves into Cyberspace.

When the protagonist, Shira, loses custody of her son Ari to her ex-husband Josh, she returns from her multi, Yakamura-Stichen (Y-S), to her hometown Tikva (Hope in Hebrew) - a Jewish freetown. There, she starts working on the socialisation of the cyborg Yod (the tenth letter in Hebrew and a symbol for God in Kabbalah), who has been created illegally by Avram to protect the city. Yod is the tenth cyborg (a robot with human appearance and programmed human characteristics) in a row of previously failed experiments whose programming has partially been completed by Malkah, Shira&#x27;s grandmother. Shira and Yod build up a (sexual) relationship between them and Shira&#x27;s childhood sweetheart Gadi, Avram&#x27;s son, also comes back to Tikva, due to his banishment for sleeping with a young girl. During the time when Malkah is working on a chimaera (security software) to protect the city from an online attack, she is attacked by Y-S, but Yod is able to stop the attack.

Eventually, Y-S invites Shira to a new custody hearing for her son. Shira, accompanied by Yod, Yod&#x27;s mother, Riva, and Nili (a biotechnologically enhanced woman from nuclear-devastated Israel), attends. The situation escalates into violence, resulting in casualties among the Y-S delegation and Riva. In response, Shira, Malkah, and Yod decide to infiltrate the Y-S network base successfully, obtaining personnel files that unveil a conspiracy against Shira and Tikva.

In the next phase, Shira, Yod, Nili, and Gadi enter the Glop, connecting with an underground group where they discover Riva alive and involved in resistance activities. Venturing into the Y-S enclave in Nebraska, they aim to kidnap Ari, resulting in Yod killing Josh. Back in Tikva, Shira&#x27;s family experiences a brief respite before Y-S invites them to a net meeting, demanding Yod for its technology. Avram agrees, hoping to create another cyborg, but Yod ensures that his self-destruction causes a simultaneous explosion in Avram&#x27;s lab. Avram perishes, and with his notes destroyed, the creation of another cyborg becomes impossible.

Finally, Malkah leaves Tikva with Nili to visit a secret town in post-nuclear holocaust Israel and to profit from the possible biotechnological enhancements. Shira is integrated into Tikva&#x27;s society further. When she discovers copies of the notes concerning Yod, she initially plans on recreating Yod, but ultimately she respects his wishes and destroys them.

The main plot is interwoven with a story Malkah tells Yod that deals with Rabbi Judah Loew who Malkah depicts as her ancestor living in the ghetto of Prague around 1600. To protect the Jewish community from the Christian mob, Loew uses the knowledge of Kabbalah to create the golem Joseph from clay. His granddaughter Chava, a highly educated woman, teaches Joseph to read and write. Joseph successfully protects the ghetto and begins to think of himself as human and makes a plea for his right to a human existence. However, when the pogrom climate calms down, Loew returns Joseph to clay. The two stories are mutually illuminating, both asking what it means to be human, both from the perspective of man-made life, and that of those who love artificial lives.

<text>The Jacques Cartier Bridge () is a steel truss cantilever bridge crossing the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal Island, Montreal, Quebec, to the south shore at Longueuil, Quebec, Canada. The bridge crosses Saint Helen&#x27;s Island in the centre of the river, where offramps allow access to the Parc Jean-Drapeau and La Ronde amusement park.

Originally named the Montreal Harbour Bridge (&quot;pont du Havre&quot;), it was renamed in 1934 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Jacques Cartier&#x27;s first voyage up the St. Lawrence River.

The five-lane highway bridge is in length, including the approach viaducts. There are approximately 35.8 million vehicle crossings annually, making it the third busiest bridge in Canada, the first being Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge, just a few kilometres (miles) upstream. The second busiest bridge in Canada overall is the Port Mann Bridge in Metro Vancouver (connecting Surrey to Coquitlam).

Together with the Champlain Bridge, it is administered by the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI), a Canadian Crown Corporation which reports to Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada.

==History==
===Planning===
Discussions began as early as 1874 about the construction of a new bridge to alleviate the congestion on Victoria Bridge, which was then a rail-only bridge, the wintertime ice bridge and the ferries used to connect the city to its south shore. The decision to build the bridge was made official in 1924. The bridge was designed by engineer Philip Louis Pratley.

===Construction===

Construction was undertaken by the Dominion Bridge Company starting in 1925. On August 9, 1926 the cornerstone was laid, integrated into the pillar at the corner of Notre Dame Street and Saint Antoine Street, opposite the Pied-du-Courant Prison. The cornerstone contains a capsule with 59 items reflecting the year in which construction began. The bridge was constructed of steel at a cost of C$23 million, and the work lasted two and a half years.

The groundbreaking was held on May 26, 1925. Construction began immediately and the cornerstone was laid on August 9, 1926 on Pillar No. 26. The superstructure was built between September 1926 and September 1929. 33,267 tons of steel were needed for its construction. The work was completed about a year and a half ahead of schedule, without disrupting river traffic.

It opened to traffic on May 14, 1930, however the inauguration ceremony took place a few days later, on May 24. The bridge was inaugurated as the &quot;Harbour Bridge&quot; but was renamed &quot;Jacques Cartier Bridge&quot; in 1934, following a petition from citizens to honour the French-Breton explorer who described and mapped the St. Lawrence River valley in 1534.

===Modifications===

The bridge was originally designed as a road, tramway, and pedestrian bridge. The original bridge had three lanes of road traffic and two sidewalks. Space in each direction was left free for the possible installation of two tramway lines. Tramway tracks were installed but never used. A parallel empty space used to exist to the right of the roadway in each direction, through which the bridge&#x27;s girders could be seen.

The roadway was expanded by an additional traffic lane on the east side in 1956 and the west side in 1959 to include the space allocated to the tramway tracks, adding an extra lane of traffic in each direction and bringing the total capacity of the bridge to five lanes. The two sidewalks were outside the bridge proper.

To accommodate large ships using the new St. Lawrence Seaway, the span over the east channel of the river (the Warren truss) was raised an additional (to ) in 1957 and 1958. Traffic flow over the bridge was uninterrupted by this construction, through the installation of two Bailey bridges.

Originally, the bridge was constructed with only one ramp to Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, located on the western side of the bridge. In 1961, a second ramp was built on the east side to prevent cars traveling toward Montreal from having to cross the path of those heading toward Longueuil in order to access St. Helen’s Island, a major source of accidents.

During 2001 and 2002 the entire deck of the bridge was replaced. The sidewalks were also widened to a width of , and the sidewalk on the western side of the bridge was made a bike path.

In 2004, the bridge authority installed a suicide prevention barrier. Until then the bridge saw an average of 10 suicides a year.

There are four 3-metre (10&#x27;) high finials, at the four high-points of the bridge, as architectural ornaments. Their shape resembles the Eiffel Tower without being a replica.


==Inspiration==

A bust of Jacques Cartier is located at the exit leading to Île Sainte-Hélène and was donated by France. The bridge follows the general design concept of the Quebec Bridge. It was, in turn, one of the design influences for the Story Bridge, in Brisbane, Australia, which was completed in 1940.
Its imposing steel structure of its main section most likely inspired the designers of J. C. Van Horne Bridge spanning the Restigouche River between Campbellton, New Brunswick and Pointe-à-la-Croix, Quebec. This bridge was not built until 1958.

==Toll==
The structure was a toll bridge from its opening until 1962 and a toll plaza was located on the southern approach. The toll plaza area now houses the offices of the corporation that owns and operates the structure and the nearby Champlain Bridge. Tokens were issued for part of the period that tolls were collected. Toll booths were abolished in 1962.

The original toll rates were as follows:
* Pedestrian: 15¢ 
* Cyclist: 15¢ 
* Motorcyclist: 25¢ 
* Automobile (for the vehicle and its driver): 25¢ 
* Additional passenger: 15¢ 
* Bus: 80¢ to $1.00 (depending on class of bus) 
* Truck: 25¢ to $1.50 (depending on the class of the truck) 
* Oil tank: 60¢ 
* Animals: 3¢ to 15¢ per animal (depending on the species) 
* Wheelbarrow: 15¢ 
* Free for children under 5 years old.

== &quot;The crooked bridge&quot; ==

From the beginning of its use, the Jacques Cartier Bridge was nicknamed &quot;the crooked bridge&quot; because of a curve at the entrance to Montreal. It was designed to avoid the land of soap factory-owner Hector Barsalou, who refused the amount the city offered him for his land.

Another curve in the middle of the bridge at the height of Île Sainte-Hélène is due to the positioning of the pillars. The pillars were built according to the direction of the stream of the river in a different axis of the streets to the North approach on the island of Montreal.

The existence of these curves has been a predominant factor in many accidents that have led to changes in signage on the bridge over the years.

== Traffic ==

The bridge has five traffic lanes, two of which are directional and one reversible for rush hour traffic and two sidewalks on each side for pedestrians and cyclists. It is also known for its famous Craig curve, a curve on the side of Montreal that once created many accidents because of its small radius and zero tilt. This deficiency was corrected in the early 2000s by raising the west side of the deck creating a slight tilt making it easier to take the curve.

The bridge is the continuation of Highway 134 and is connected to the multiplex formed by Highway 20 and the René-Lévesque Highway via an interchange. It continues on the South Shore in a short motorway section of Highway 134, which ends at an interchange with roads 112 and 116, before becoming boulevard Taschereau.

On the Island of Montreal, the bridge connects to De Lorimier Avenue East and Papineau Avenue West.

It is estimated that up to 115,000 vehicles use it per day, for an annual average of 34.7 million vehicles.

== Maintenance ==
Over the last twenty years, major ongoing renovation programs have been completed, including painting and deck replacement to preserve the integrity of the structure and to ensure a safe passage for users. In 2016, a rebuilding cycle was completed for almost all pillars.

JCCBI, the structure&#x27;s responsible manager, is carrying out a structural steel reinforcement program dating back to 1920, in order to extend the life span of the bridge. Specifically, some steel ribs and reinforcing plates have been replaced and reinforced.

== Disruptions ==
This bridge has been shut down several times due to several protesters who have individually climbed on the superstructure of the bridge or on a sign in the Longueuil side of the bridge. Two of them were from the Fathers for Justice group, while a third claimed he was part of the group. Recently, a man wearing a Canadian flag climbed the structure of the bridge. Most of the protests led to massive traffic congestion during rush hour. Recently, the pedestrian paths were modified with the installation of round metal fences all around in both directions, to prevent climbing of the superstructure and discourage potential suicide jumpers, the two main problems associated with pedestrian traffic on the bridge.

==&quot;Living Connections&quot; lighting ==
To mark both the 150th anniversary of Canada and the 375th anniversary of Montreal, the bridge was refitted in 2017 with new decorative lights. The project, &quot;Living Connections&quot; was designed and installed over a period of 3 years by Montreal-based Moment Factory in collaboration with other local partners (Réalisations Inc. Montreal, Ambiances Design Productions, ATOMIC3, Éclairage Public/ Ombrages, Lucion Média and UDO Design). Project management was provided by JCCBI. The system, which allows for varying colors and animation, is scheduled to remain active until 2027. The interior lighting network changes with the passing of seasons, while the exterior lighting network uses big data, translated in real time to feed LED lighting networks on the outsides of the bridge superstructure, making the structure the first &quot;connected&quot; bridge in the world. Réalisations Inc. Montreal is responsible for the idea of using big data as a modulator of the bridge lighting program, as well as the design and production of the custom software and training of on-site operators to bring this concept to life.

Fifty-three types of data pertaining to Montreal, across eleven categories, are tracked to feed the bridge&#x27;s lighting systems, included but not limited to; weather, traffic, noise and activity on social media. The bridge is then invaded by luminous movements in the colours of the most discussed topics of the day by the Montreal media: society (red), environment (green), technology (light blue), business (gray), sports (blue), institutions (pink), culture (purple). The systems track this data using physical capture systems such as sensors and cameras as well as through hashtags and keywords on online platforms. More information on how data is interpreted and expressed in light, and the systems used to do so, can be found on the Réalisations website.

The bridge is part of the cycle of the seasons thanks to a chromatic calendar of 365 colours. Day after day, it is transformed, progressively from the spring energizing green, to the radiant summer orange, to the voluptuous autumn red and the icy blue of winter. The bridge also gives the pulse of Montreal life in real time. The intensity, speed and density of light movements are fueled by the mention of Montreal on Twitter.

The first lighting up of the bridge occurred on May 17, 2017, the same day associated with the founding of Montreal in 1642 and officially kicking off the festivities for the 375th anniversary.

=== Lighting of the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Numbers ===
* 15,650 tonnes: weight of bridge superstructure
* 10,000 fastening systems: to secure the luminaires on the steel supports fixed to the bridge
* 10.4 km: cabling needed for bridge lighting for data transfer and power supply
* 2,807 luminaires: a combination of projectors and strips bathes the steel superstructure in colourful ambience light that changes in accordance to the effervescence of the metropolis.
* More than 200 participants: from all professional backgrounds contributed to the project (creatives, engineers, designers, project managers, programmers, rope access technicians, electricians, steel erectors, traffic officers, etc.).

<doc id="523876" wikidata="Q1063849" url="?curid=523876" title="Charles Bulfinch">
<text>Charles Bulfinch (August 8, 1763 – April 15, 1844) was an early American architect, and has been regarded by many as the first American-born professional architect to practice.

==Life==
Bulfinch split his career between his native Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., where he served as Commissioner of Public Building and built the intermediate United States Capitol rotunda and dome. His works are notable for their simplicity, balance, and good taste, and as the origin of a distinctive Federal style of classical domes, columns, and ornament that dominated early 19th-century American architecture.

==Early life==
Bulfinch was born in Boston to Thomas Bulfinch, a prominent physician, and his wife, Susan Apthorp, daughter of Charles Apthorp. At the age of 12, he watched the Battle of Bunker Hill from this home on the Boston side of the Charles River. Charles himself was married to Hannah Apthorp on 20 November 1788 in Boston.

He was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University, from which he graduated with an AB in 1781 and master&#x27;s degree in 1784.

He then made a grand tour of Europe from 1785 to 1788, traveling to London, Paris, and the major cities of Italy. Bulfinch was greatly influenced by Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. He was also influenced by the classical architecture in Italy and the neoclassical buildings of Sir Christopher Wren, Robert Adam, William Chambers, and others in the United Kingdom. Thomas Jefferson became something of a mentor to him in Europe, as he would later be to Robert Mills.

Upon his return to the United States in 1787, he became a promoter of the ship &quot;Columbia Rediviva&#x27;s&quot; voyage around the world under command of Captain Robert Gray (1755–1806). It was the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe. In 1788, he married Hannah Apthorp, his first cousin. Their sons include Thomas Bulfinch (1796–1867), author of &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, and Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch (1809–1870), Unitarian clergyman and author.

==Career==
Bulfinch&#x27;s first building was the Hollis Street Church (1788). Among his other early works are a memorial column on Beacon Hill (1789), the first monument to the American Revolution; the Federal Street theater (1793); the &quot;Tontine Crescent&quot; (built 1793–1794, now demolished), fashioned in part after John Wood&#x27;s Royal Crescent; the Old State House in Hartford, Connecticut (1796); and the Massachusetts State House (1798). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791.

Over the course of ten years, Bulfinch built a remarkable number of private dwellings in the Boston area, including Joseph Barrell&#x27;s Pleasant Hill (1793), a series of three houses in Boston for Harrison Gray Otis (1796, 1800, 1806), and the John Phillips House (1804). He built several churches in Boston, of which New North (built 1802–1804) is the last standing.

Serving from 1791 to 1795 on Boston&#x27;s board of selectmen, he resigned due to business pressures but returned in 1799. From 1799 to 1817, he was the chairman of Boston&#x27;s board of selectmen continuously, and served as a paid police superintendent, improving the city&#x27;s streets, drains, and lighting. Under his direction, both the infrastructure and civic center of Boston were transformed into a dignified, classical style. Bulfinch was responsible for the design of the Boston Common, the remodeling and enlargement of Faneuil Hall (1805), and the construction of India Wharf. In these Boston years, he also designed the Massachusetts State Prison (1803); Boylston Market (1810); University Hall for Harvard University (1813–1814); First Church of Christ, Unitarian in Lancaster, Massachusetts (1815–1817); and the Bulfinch Building, home of the Ether Dome at Massachusetts General Hospital (1818), its completion overseen by Alexander Parris, who was working in Bulfinch&#x27;s office at the time the architect was summoned to Washington.

Despite this great activity and civic involvement, Bulfinch was insolvent several times starting in 1796, including at the start of his work on the statehouse, and was jailed for the month of July 1811 for debt (in a prison he had designed himself). There was no payment for his services as selectman, and he received only $1,400 for designing and overseeing the construction of the State House.

In the summer of 1817, Bulfinch&#x27;s roles as selectman, designer, and public official coincided during a visit by President James Monroe. The two men were almost constantly in each other&#x27;s company for the week-long visit, and a few months later (1818), Monroe appointed Bulfinch the successor to Benjamin Henry Latrobe (1764–1820) as Architect of the Capitol in Washington, DC (the Capitol Building had been partially burned by the British in 1814.) In this position, he was paid a salary of $2,500 per year plus expenses.

He was also a founding member of The Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture (M.S.P.A.), one of the earliest agricultural societies in the United States. The Society was incorporated by an act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on March 7, 1792.

As Commissioner of Public Building, Bulfinch completed the Capitol&#x27;s wings and central portion, designed the western approach and portico, and constructed the Capitol&#x27;s original low wooden dome to his own design (replaced by the present cast-iron dome completed in the mid-1860s). In 1829 Bulfinch completed the construction of the Capitol, 36 years after its cornerstone was laid. During his interval in Washington, Bulfinch also drew plans for the State House in Augusta, Maine (1829–1832), a Unitarian Church and prison in Washington, D.C.. In 1827, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member. He returned to Boston in 1830, where he died on April 15, 1844, aged 80, and was buried in King&#x27;s Chapel Burial Ground in Boston. His tomb was later moved to Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1943, a United States Liberty ship named the SS &quot;Charles Bulfinch&quot; was launched.

<text>In topology, a topological space is called simply connected (or 1-connected, or 1-simply connected) if it is path-connected and every path between two points can be continuously transformed into any other such path while preserving the two endpoints in question. Intuitively, this corresponds to a space that has no disjoint parts and no holes that go completely through it, because two paths going around different sides of such a hole cannot be continuously transformed into each other. The fundamental group of a topological space is an indicator of the failure for the space to be simply connected: a path-connected topological space is simply connected if and only if its fundamental group is trivial.

==Definition and equivalent formulations==

A topological space formula_1 is called if it is path-connected and any loop in formula_1 defined by formula_3 can be contracted to a point: there exists a continuous map formula_4 such that formula_5 restricted to formula_6 is formula_7 Here, formula_6 and formula_9 denotes the unit circle and closed unit disk in the Euclidean plane respectively.

An equivalent formulation is this: formula_1 is simply connected if and only if it is path-connected, and whenever formula_11 and formula_12 are two paths (that is, continuous maps) with the same start and endpoint (formula_13 and formula_14), then formula_15 can be continuously deformed into formula_16 while keeping both endpoints fixed. Explicitly, there exists a homotopy formula_17 such that formula_18 and formula_19

A topological space formula_1 is simply connected if and only if formula_1 is path-connected and the fundamental group of formula_1 at each point is trivial, i.e. consists only of the identity element. Similarly, formula_1 is simply connected if and only if for all points formula_24 the set of morphisms formula_25 in the fundamental groupoid of formula_1 has only one element.

In complex analysis: an open subset formula_27 is simply connected if and only if both formula_1 and its complement in the Riemann sphere are connected. The set of complex numbers with imaginary part strictly greater than zero and less than one furnishes an example of an unbounded, connected, open subset of the plane whose complement is not connected. It is nevertheless simply connected. A relaxation of the requirement that formula_1 be connected leads to an exploration of open subsets of the plane with connected extended complement. For example, a (not necessarily connected) open set has a connected extended complement exactly when each of its connected components is simply connected.

==Informal discussion==

Informally, an object in our space is simply connected if it consists of one piece and does not have any &quot;holes&quot; that pass all the way through it. For example, neither a doughnut nor a coffee cup (with a handle) is simply connected, but a hollow rubber ball is simply connected. In two dimensions, a circle is not simply connected, but a disk and a line are. Spaces that are connected but not simply connected are called non-simply connected or multiply connected.

The definition rules out only handle-shaped holes. A sphere (or, equivalently, a rubber ball with a hollow center) is simply connected, because any loop on the surface of a sphere can contract to a point even though it has a &quot;hole&quot; in the hollow center. The stronger condition, that the object has no holes of dimension, is called contractibility.
==Examples==

* The Euclidean plane formula_30 is simply connected, but formula_30 minus the origin formula_32 is not. If formula_33 then both formula_34 and formula_34 minus the origin are simply connected.
* Analogously: the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere formula_36 is simply connected if and only if formula_37
* Every convex subset of formula_34 is simply connected.
* A torus, the (elliptic) cylinder, the Möbius strip, the projective plane and the Klein bottle are not simply connected.
* Every topological vector space is simply connected; this includes Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.
* For formula_39 the special orthogonal group formula_40 is not simply connected and the special unitary group formula_41 is simply connected.
* The one-point compactification of formula_42 is not simply connected (even though formula_42 is simply connected).
* The long line formula_44 is simply connected, but its compactification, the extended long line formula_45 is not (since it is not even path connected).

==Properties==
A surface (two-dimensional topological manifold) is simply connected if and only if it is connected and its genus (the number of of the surface) is 0.

A universal cover of any (suitable) space formula_1 is a simply connected space which maps to formula_1 via a covering map.

If formula_1 and formula_49 are homotopy equivalent and formula_1 is simply connected, then so is formula_51

The image of a simply connected set under a continuous function need not be simply connected. Take for example the complex plane under the exponential map: the image is formula_52 which is not simply connected.

The notion of simple connectedness is important in complex analysis because of the following facts: 
* The Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem states that if formula_53 is a simply connected open subset of the complex plane formula_54 and formula_55 is a holomorphic function, then formula_56 has an antiderivative formula_5 on formula_58 and the value of every line integral in formula_53 with integrand formula_56 depends only on the end points formula_61 and formula_62 of the path, and can be computed as formula_63 The integral thus does not depend on the particular path connecting formula_61 and formula_65 
* The Riemann mapping theorem states that any non-empty open simply connected subset of formula_66 (except for formula_66 itself) is conformally equivalent to the unit disk.

The notion of simple connectedness is also a crucial condition in the Poincaré conjecture.

<doc id="523882" wikidata="Q779495" url="?curid=523882" title="Works (Pink Floyd album)">
<text>Works is a compilation album of songs by British rock band Pink Floyd, released in 1983. It features a variety of material, including two of the band&#x27;s early singles &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, alternative mixes of tracks from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and the studio outtake &quot;Embryo&quot;.

==Release and contents==

The album was released by Pink Floyd&#x27;s former American label, Capitol Records, to compete with their then-current studio album &quot;The Final Cut&quot;. The album is particularly notable for including the track &quot;Embryo&quot;, an outtake from the &quot;Ummagumma&quot; album that later became a concert staple in a greatly elongated form. Previously, the track had only appeared on a scarce various artists compilation album promoting Pink Floyd&#x27;s UK label Harvest Records entitled &quot;Picnic – A Breath of Fresh Air&quot; in January 1970.

Some tracks are crossfaded into one another, such as &quot;See Emily Play&quot; into &quot;Several Species...&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot; into &quot;Brain Damage&quot;. The album also opens with a heartbeat similar to the opening of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; that fades into the wind intro of &quot;One of These Days&quot;. This creates a bookend effect on side 1, which ends with the heartbeat fadeout of &quot;Eclipse&quot;.

==Cover==
The cover art, illustrated by Ron Larson, was inspired by the c. 1948 poster &quot;Nederland industrialiseert&quot; (&quot;The Netherlands industrialise&quot;), designed by Dutch graphic artist Wladimir Flem.

<text>Jin Au-Yeung (; born June 4, 1982), known professionally as MC Jin, is an American rapper, songwriter, actor and comedian of Chinese descent. Jin is notable for being the first Asian American solo rapper to be signed to a major record label in the United States.

==Early life==
Jin Au-Yeung was born on June 4, 1982, in Miami, Florida, to Hong Kong immigrants of Hakka descent. He was raised in the general Miami area, where his parents owned a Chinese restaurant and Jin attended John F. Kennedy Middle School in North Miami Beach. Jin went on to attend North Miami Beach Senior High School, from which he graduated in 2000. After graduating, Jin decided to forgo college and begin his rap career. Shortly afterwards, his parents closed the restaurant and the family moved in 2001 to Queens, New York City.

==Career==

===2001–2006: &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; and Ruff Ryders===
While in New York, Jin participated in many rap battles with his peers.

Jin&#x27;s big break came in 2002 when the BET program &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; invited local rappers to compete in a segment known as Freestyle Friday. Unlike other competitors, Jin occasionally spoke Cantonese in his freestyle verses. After winning seven battles in a row, he was inducted into the Freestyle Friday Hall of Fame. The night of the ceremony, he announced that he had signed a deal with the Ruff Ryders Entertainment label.

His first single under Ruff Ryders was titled &quot;Learn Chinese&quot; featuring Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean. It contained a sample from song &quot;Blind Man Can See It&quot;, by James Brown (also sampled by Das EFX and Lord Finesse). The second single for the album was originally supposed to be &quot;I Got a Love&quot;, featuring and produced by Kanye West. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the summer of 2003 but was delayed for over a year by the label. In October 2004, Jin released his debut album, &quot;The Rest Is History&quot;, which reached number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums chart. The two singles, &quot;Learn Chinese&quot; and &quot;Senorita&quot;, were not major mainstream successes and the album only sold 19,000 units in its first week. Jin left the label in 2006.

On April 23, 2005, Jin and rapper Serius Jones engaged in a rap battle. The battle was featured on Fight Klub DVD.

On May 18, 2005, Jin revealed that he would be putting his rap career on hold in order to explore other options. To make this clear, he recorded a song titled &quot;I Quit&quot;, produced by the Golden Child. The announcement was widely misunderstood to have marked the end of Jin&#x27;s rap career. However, he later re-emerged under a different alias, The Emcee, and freestyled over such songs as Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Dear Summer.&quot; He released a single called &quot;Top 5 (Dead or Alive)&quot; in which he explored the history of hip-hop&#x27;s greatest artists, using lyrics. The legendary DJ Kool Herc, who is credited as the founder of hip-hop, appears in Jin&#x27;s music video. With independent label CraftyPlugz/Draft Records, Jin released his second album, &quot;The Emcee&#x27;s Properganda&quot;, on October 25, 2005.

Jin collaborated in 2005 with Queens-born rapper Creature on his song &quot;Never Say Die,&quot; which also featured Slug and Busdriver.

Jin was also featured on Taiwanese pop artist Leehom Wang&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Heroes of Earth&quot;. Together, Jin and Leehom performed their &quot;Heroes of the Earth&quot; collaboration live in Shanghai on February 16, 2006, at an event arranged by China-resident American A&amp;R exec Andrew Ballen. Ballen was also the first promoter to bring Jin to mainland China in 2003 for his &quot;The Rest is History&quot; tour.

===2006–2007: Independent label===
Jin released two albums in 2006. The first, &quot;100 Grand Jin&quot;, was a mixtape that was released on August 29, 2006. The single released from the album is &quot;FYI&quot;, for which the rapper shot and released a music video. The second album is Jin&#x27;s third LP, &quot;I Promise&quot;.

On his MySpace, Jin mentioned that he was working on another English album named &quot;Birthdays, Funerals and Things in Between&quot;. Jin premiered the song, &quot;Open Letter to Obama,&quot; on April 24, 2007, which made him become 1st on then-Presidential nominee Barack Obama&#x27;s Top 8 list on &quot;MySpace&quot;.

On April 16, 2007, Jin made a tribute song to the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre called &quot;Rain, Rain Go Away&quot;. Later that year, Jin decided to make his November 2006 online album, &quot;I Promise&quot; available in retail stores; it was given an October 23, 2007, release.

In 2006, the PlayStation 2/Xbox video game &quot;NBA Ballers: Phenom&quot; featured MC Jin as one of the rapper characters along with Trikz, Ludacris and Hot Sauce.

He released his first all-Cantonese language album, &quot;ABC&quot;, in 2007.

===2008–2011: Success in Hong Kong and newfound Christian faith===
In 2008, Universal Music Hong Kong flew Jin out to Hong Kong to promote the re-release of his Cantonese album &quot;ABC.&quot; In an interview, Jin commented, &quot;I think with various artists, Cantonese hip-hop was starting to become more and more widespread.&quot; &quot;ABC&quot; debuted at #1 and achieved gold status in Hong Kong. He frequently starred in commercials there and made numerous appearances on TVB like &quot;Big Boys Club&quot;. He is also seen as an important part of recent Asian hip hop trends and was once deemed &quot;the changing face of Cantopop.&quot;

Jin did a collaboration with Malaysian rapper Point Blanc in a track titled &quot;One Day&quot; (2008).

He also put the song &quot;Welcome to the Light Club&quot; on his Myspace page. Jin is a Christian, stating in his song &quot;Welcome to the Light Club&quot; he was baptized in 2008. He has featured in Far East Movement&#x27;s &quot;Millionaire&quot;. He has done a track over a DJ Premier-produced joint titled &quot;World Premier&quot;. He also collaborated with producer Trendsetter (aka Mark Holiday).

He has recently thrown out a Hip-Hop Census in honor of the 2010 Census and Chinese New Year, 2010. As said by Jin, this mixtape is open to anybody and will be mixed from the general population along with Jin. He released a mixtape entitled &quot;Say Something&quot;, on May 15, 2010. Jin released an album with his friend Hanjin Tan in 2010. On July 10, 2010, Jin collaborated with singer Hanjin Tan () to release another Cantonese album (Buy one get one free). Jin also released a music video for his English single &quot;Angels&quot;.

During his time in Hong Kong, Jin has appeared in films such as &quot;Gallants&quot; and &quot;Bruce Lee, My Brother&quot;.

In December, 2010, Jin released a Christmas music video entitled &quot;Rap Now, 2010&quot; with Hong Kong Chief Executive, Donald Tsang. The video, with lyrics penned by Jin, featured a number of lines ending with &quot;Act Now!&quot; (), echoing a Hong Kong government slogan. It garnered in excess of nine million views on the CE office&#x27;s YouTube channel. A CNN report described the video as an &quot;official eyesore&quot; and &quot;a political message thinly veiled as a Christmas card,&quot; and further criticized Jin&#x27;s rapping as resembling &quot;awkward nursery rhymes,&quot; in contrast to his earlier performances. However, local newspaper &quot;The Standard&quot;, in response to critics, stated in an editorial that &quot;Tsang, like the millions who post videos of themselves or their loved ones, only wants to have fun.&quot;

On March 7, 2011, Jin released a music video for a song from his upcoming English album entitled &quot;Charlie Sheen,&quot; collaborating with artists Dumbfoundead and Traphik. Jin released an EP titled &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot;, a Christian-oriented and self-improvement-oriented EP featuring positive messages about life and self-reflective insights into his own life. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Jin participated in the &quot;Artistes 311 Love Beyond Borders&quot; celebrity charity concert on April 1, 2011, to help raise funds for Japan&#x27;s disaster recovery effort. The 3-hour event raised over HK$26 million (USD$3.3 million).

On May 16, 2011, Jin released the track &quot;AIYA&quot; featuring label-mate, Toestah. On August 8, 2011, Jin released his second Cantonese album, (Homecoming), in Hong Kong.

=== 2012–2017: Return to the United States ===
In 2012, Jin announced that he was moving back to the United States to raise his son with his wife in New York.

In February 2012, Jin released a re-vamped version of his EP, &quot;Sincerely Yours 2.0&quot;, featuring some of the same lyrics, but many others changed, slightly altering the overall feel of the record. In August 2012, Jin released his English album, &quot;Crazy Love Ridiculous Faith&quot;, for free download, an album in which he positively addresses both Christians and non-Christians. In December 2012, Jin released the &quot;Brand New Me&quot; EP.

In late 2013, Jin collaborated with independent label, The Great Company. The first track released on the label was called &quot;Hypocrite (The Gold Chapter).&quot; On December 21, 2013, Jin released the first EP under the label called &quot;Hypocrite.&quot;

On October 21, 2014, the label released Jin&#x27;s first album under their label: &quot;XIV:LIX&quot;, which is &quot;14:59&quot; in Roman numerals and a reference to the concept of 15 minutes of fame. The album features Teesa, Hollis, Stacie Bollman, Tim Be Told, Bére, and Storm. The album was not a commercial success.

Jin began performing stand-up comedy in New York City in 2015.

===2017–present: Success in mainland China===
In 2017, he competed in the Chinese rap competition show, &quot;The Rap of China&quot;, in a masked attire, under the alias of &quot;HipHopMan.&quot;

Jin has since released several songs in Mandarin, including &quot;Zero&quot;, a promotional song for the 2017 movie &quot;The Foreigner&quot; starring Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan, who considers Jin to be his friend.

In 2021, he joined the cast of &quot;Call Me by Fire&quot; as a contestant. He was eliminated in episode 5, only to return later in episode 6, following fellow contestant Henry Huo Zun&#x27;s withdrawal from the show in light of recent controversies.

==Personal life==
Jin married his wife Carol on February 12, 2011, in Puerto Rico. The couple met at a concert at where Jin was performing. They have two sons: Chance (born 2012) and Justus (born 2019).

Jin became a born again Christian in 2008. He was converted by Chinese American pastor Jaeson Ma. He has since released several gospel themed projects expressing his faith.

During the 2008 United States presidential election, Jin expressed his support for Barack Obama. Proceeds from his song &quot;Open Letter to Obama&quot; were donated to Obama&#x27;s campaign. In 2019, he announced on Twitter that he was officially endorsing presidential candidate Andrew Yang in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He has released two songs supporting Yang: &quot;Drew Yang Gang, That&#x27;s Who I Hooked Up Wit&#x27;&quot; and &quot;#8MileYang&quot;. Jin also toured with Andrew Yang&#x27;s campaign events. In April 2021, he released “Yang for New York,” a song and video in support of Andrew Yang’s run for mayor of New York City. The three-minute video features such lyrics as “Everyone — white, brown, yellow and black / It’s time to come together, what’s ironic is that / NY forward will bring New York Back.”

==Catchphrases and fan culture==
Jin&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Aiya!&quot; (), a Chinese interjection roughly equivalent to &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot;. Fans pictured with the logo were able to appear in the music video for his song &quot;Aiya!&quot; (featuring Toestah). Jin also refers to his fans as his &quot;AIYAfambam&quot;.

After his success and popularity on the Rap of China, Jin gained widespread respect and popularity throughout China, and also with the Chinese people worldwide. A China fanbase is secure with an official account on Weibo &quot;MCJin欧阳靖全国粉丝后援会&quot; on August 12, 2017. Jin then officially named his Chinese fans &quot;不帥團隊&quot; (Team Bu-shuai), a name which he came up with due to the focus on looks-oriented artists. Bu-Shuai means &#x27;not handsome&#x27; in Mandarin, and Jin joked with his fans that although he is not handsome as compared to many artists, he is proud to be so as he is secure in himself as an &#x27;un-handsome&#x27;. The official slogan for Team Bu-shuai is &quot;生活愉快、越來不帥&quot;, which means to live joyfully and become more and more &#x27;un-handsome&#x27;. A series of official Team Bu=shuai merchandise such as tees, hoodies, windbreakers, and caps donning the slogan and team name (designed by Jin) is also available on Taobao. Jin also released the song &quot;不帥&quot; with an official music video made by him and Team Bu-shuai. The song talks about the special relationship between Jin and his beloved Team Bu-Shuai, promoting the slogan &quot;生活愉快、越來不帥&quot;. The fanbase &#x27;Team Bu-shuai&#x27; has an official account on Weibo, with over 55,000 followers. Jin actively interacts with its members online, and is known to sometimes arrange to meet them in different cities for movies and coffees offline.

Members of Jin&#x27;s fan club on Twitter are known as Emojins. He referenced them in his 2018 song &#x27;Debut&#x27;: &quot;Shout out to the emojins, and the emojins only.&quot;

<text>The yellow ribbon is used for various purposes. It may be worn on a person, placed on a vehicle, around a tree, or for a neck tie.
==History and etymology==

===Early Puritan history===
The song/poem &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; has appeared in various forms for at least four centuries. It is based upon the same general theme: A woman of destiny is under some sort of test or trial as she waits for her beloved to return. Will she be true to him? This seems to be the lingering question and the basis for a great unfolding drama.

The song appears to have been brought to America from Europe by English settlers. The origin of the yellow ribbons seems likely to have come from out of the Puritan heritage. It was during the English Civil War that the Puritan Army of English Parliament wore yellow ribbons and yellow sashes onto the battlefield.

===&quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot;===
Yellow is the official color of the armor branch of the U.S. Army, used in insignia, etc., and depicted in Hollywood movies by the yellow neckerchief adorning latter-half 19th century, horse-mounted U.S. Cavalry soldiers. However, a review of the U.S. War Department&#x27;s &quot;Regulations for the Uniform and Dress of the Army of the United States&quot; (1872, 1898) reveals that a neckerchief, of any color, was not an item required by dress code. Despite this, neckerchiefs were a popular accessory employed by cavalrymen to cope with the frequently dusty environs. The specific association of the yellow neckerchief with the U.S. Cavalry may have arisen from a work of popular American West artist Frederic Remington—&quot;Lieutenant Powhatan H. Clarke, Tenth Cavalry&quot; (1888).

In the United States military, the symbol of the yellow ribbon is used in a popular marching song. The first version copyrighted was the 1917 version by George A. Norton, which he titled &quot;Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon (For Her Lover Who Is Far, Far Away)&quot;. While he tells in the song about the love between Susie Simpkins and her soldier lover Silas Hubbard, his chorus goes:

::&quot; &#x27;Round her neck she wears a yeller ribbon,She wears it in winter and the summer so they say,If you ask her &quot;Why the decoration?&quot;She&#x27;ll say &quot;It&#x27;s for my lover who is far, far away.&quot;

The lyrics were altered and the song was titled &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; by Russ Morgan for the 1949 movie of the same name. This was performed by several popular musicians of the 1940s, including Mitch Miller and The Andrews Sisters. The Tanner Sisters recorded their version in London on December 30, 1949. It was released by His Master&#x27;s Voice as catalog number B 9873.

The text of the Army version approximates the following, with local variations:

::&quot;Around her hair she wore a yellow ribbonShe wore it in the springtimeIn the merry month of MayAnd if you ask her why the heck she wore itShe wore it for her soldier who was far far away&quot;

:::&quot;Far away, far awayShe wore it for her soldierWho was far, far away&quot;

::&quot;Around the block she pushed a baby carriageShe pushed it in the springtimeIn the Merry month of MayAnd if you ask her why the heck she pushed itShe pushed it for her soldier who was far far away&quot;

:::&quot;Far away, far awayShe pushed it for her soldierWho was far, far away&quot;

::&quot;Behind the door her daddy kept a shotgunHe kept it in the springtimeIn the merry month of MayAnd if you ask him why the heck he kept itHe kept it for her soldier who was far far away&quot;

:::&quot;Far away, far awayHe kept it for her soldierWho was far, far away&quot;

::&quot;On the grave she laid the pretty flowersShe laid them in the springtimeIn the merry month of MayAnd if you asked her why the heck she laid themShe laid them for her soldier who was far far away&quot;

:::&quot;Far away, far awayShe laid them for her soldierWho was far, far away&quot;

===Forgiveness===
In a 1991 speech, former Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints president Thomas S. Monson quoted a story relayed by prison warden Kenyon J. Scudder in a 1961 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article. The story described a man whose family used a white ribbon as a sign of forgiveness. Monson then connected the story to the tradition of the yellow ribbon&#x27;s use as a symbol of home-welcoming and forgiveness.
: &quot;A friend of his happened to be sitting in a railroad coach next to a young man who was obviously depressed. Finally, the young man revealed that he was a paroled convict returning from a distant prison. His imprisonment had brought shame to his family, and they had neither visited him nor written often. He hoped, however, that this was only because they were too poor to travel and too uneducated to write. He hoped, despite the evidence, that they had forgiven him.

: &quot;To make it easy for them, however, he had written to them asking that they put up a signal for him when the train passed their little farm on the outskirts of town. If his family had forgiven him, they were to put up a white ribbon in the big apple tree which stood near the tracks. If they didn&#x27;t want him to return, they were to do nothing, and he would remain on the train as it traveled onward.

: &quot;As the train neared his hometown, the suspense became so great that he couldn’t bear to look out of his window. He exclaimed, &#x27;In just five minutes the engineer will sound the whistle indicating our approach to the long bend which opens into the valley I know as home. Will you watch for the apple tree at the side of the track?&#x27; His companion said he would; they exchanged places. The minutes seemed like hours, but then there came the shrill sound of the train whistle. The young man asked, &#x27;Can you see the tree? Is there a white ribbon?&#x27;

: &quot;Came the reply, &#x27;I see the tree. I see not one white ribbon, but many. There is a white ribbon on every branch. Son, someone surely does love you.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;===
The symbol became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s. It was the central theme of the popular song &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;, Written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and recorded by Tony Orlando and Dawn (among many others), as the sign a released prisoner requested from his wife or lover to indicate that she would welcome him home. He would be able to see it from the bus driving by their house and would stay on the bus in the absence of the ribbon. He turned out to be very welcome: There were a hundred yellow ribbons.

From the Library of Congress:

:In October 1971, newspaper columnist Pete Hamill wrote a piece for the &quot;New York Post&quot; called &quot;Going Home.&quot; In it, college students on a bus trip to the beaches of Fort Lauderdale make friends with an ex-convict who is watching for a yellow handkerchief on a roadside oak. Hamill claimed to have heard this story in oral tradition.

:In June 1972, nine months later, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; reprinted &quot;Going Home.&quot; Also in June 1972, ABC-TV aired a dramatized version of it in which James Earl Jones played the role of the returning ex-con. A month-and-a-half after that, Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown registered for copyright a song they called &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.&quot; The authors said they heard the story while serving in the military. Pete Hamill was not convinced and filed suit for infringement.

One factor that may have influenced Hamill&#x27;s decision to do so was that, in May 1973, &quot;Tie A Yellow Ribbon&quot; sold 3 million records in three weeks. When the dust settled, BMI calculated that radio stations had played it 3 million times, or seventeen continuous years of airplay. Hamill dropped his suit after folklorists working for Levine and Brown turned up archival versions of the story that had been collected before &quot;Going Home&quot; had been written.

=== Original AIDS awareness ribbon ===
The yellow ribbon was the original symbol for AIDS awareness, before the red ribbon became used for HIV/AIDS from 1991 onwards.

== Bladder cancer and sarcoma==
Yellow ribbons are the emblem used for bladder cancer and sarcoma awareness.

==Endometriosis==
The yellow ribbon is the emblem for endometriosis awareness, especially during March for endometriosis awareness month. Yellow ribbons are worn by endometriosis patients and supporters, and is a common color for fundraising products. This was established by the Endometriosis Foundation of America in the 1980s, using the color yellow for its awareness brochure.

== Microcephaly ==
The color associated with microcephaly awareness is yellow, as well. Microcephaly is a physical finding consistent with the incomplete development of the head—and often the brain—at birth or soon thereafter. Microcephaly Awareness Day is on September 30.

==Suicide prevention==
The yellow ribbon is an emblem for suicide prevention awareness, particularly for young people, and is used for suicide prevention awareness in many countries including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland.

In Brazil, &quot;Yellow September&quot; is a movement to raise awareness about the problem of suicide in the country.

In the United States, the Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program is a community-based program primarily developed to address youth/teen/young adult suicides (ages 10–25) through public awareness campaigns, education and training and by helping communities build capacity. The program began in September 1994 after the suicide of 17-year-old Mike Emme.

==Usage in various countries==

===Australia===
In Australia, the Save Albert Park group has utilized the yellow ribbon as a symbol of protest. The group is a coalition protesting the reclamation of public space in Albert Park, Melbourne for the annual Australian Grand Prix. When the race moved to Melbourne in 1996, yellow ribbons were tied around the trees in the park which were designated for removal. Although the group was unsuccessful in protecting the designated trees, they and their supporters still tie ribbons around the trees each year at the time of the race.

In 2009, the yellow ribbon was used during the appeal for those affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires.

The yellow ribbon is also used for the Australian National Road Safety Week.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, &quot;Yellow September&quot; is a movement to raise awareness about the problem of suicide in the country.

===Canada===
A yellow ribbon, for any symbolic purpose, was uncommon in Canada until the Great War when it was used by mothers and wives of soldiers who were fighting. The ribbon represented a commitment, belief, and hope in the Canadian soldiers.

World War II created a more powerful nationalism and national pride when Canada entered the war. The yellow ribbon began to represent the close ties and strong relationship it had with France and Great Britain, forgiving the countries of all past wrongs and fighting for their brothers and sisters. As the war progressed and an allied defeat seemed imminent, the ribbon represented the close ties the soldiers had back home and for their country, Canada.

On September 11, 2001, three planes were hijacked and were deliberately crashed into World Trade Center 1, World Trade Center 2 and The Pentagon. A fourth plane was hijacked but failed to crash into its intended target, the White House. Nearly 3,000 Americans died. The Canadian Government enacted Operation Yellow Ribbon, to land hundreds of flights bound for the United States and all flights out of the United States. The ICAO announced at 9:40 am EDT that all U.S bound flights, whether over Canada or having had just departed, were to land in Canada anyway for security and protection purposes. Operation Yellow Ribbon represented Canada&#x27;s connection and ties to America and Canada&#x27;s commitment to give the American people who were stranded, food, healthcare, and shelter until all was safe and they could go home.

===China===
China uses the yellow ribbon as a reminder of the 2015 Sinking of &quot;Dong Fang Zhi Xing&quot;.

===Cuba===
Cuba utilized the yellow ribbon to spread awareness of, and show ones support for freeing the Cuban Five imprisoned in the United States. On 12 September 2013, the fifteen year anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban Five, Cubans marked the day with a massive display of yellow ribbons. The symbol of the yellow ribbon to welcome loved ones home is an image Cubans hoped would resonate with the American people.

===Denmark and Sweden===
In Denmark, the yellow ribbon has become the more or less official (though not directly officially endorsed by the countries&#x27; armed forces) symbol for support of troops in missions. In Sweden, Swedish Veteran Federation and Stiftelsen Jesper Lindbloms Minne is promoting it as a troop-supporting symbol, for both military and non-military personnel on peacekeeping missions. In Sweden the yellow ribbon is also associated with testicular cancer awareness, maybe more so than a symbol for support of troops in missions.

===Estonia===
In Estonia the yellow ribbon was taken into use on 13 May 2011 after the President of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves made the following announcement on Facebook: &quot;The families of the seven Estonian citizens taken hostage in Lebanon need all of our support. Not intrusive nosiness but rather quiet and committed support that says: your concern is our concern, we hope and believe together with you. Today, to show this, I put a yellow ribbon on my lapel.&quot;
The seven Estonian citizens referred to by the President, were taken hostage on 23 March 2011 in eastern Lebanon during a cycling trip. On 14 July 2011 it was announced that the hostages had been freed.
The yellow ribbon was worn in person, but also virtually on Facebook. For that, a specialised Facebook App was created for people to automatically be able to add a yellow ribbon to their profile pictures. As of 14 July 2011, 12,671 people had added the yellow ribbon to their profile picture.

===Germany===
In Germany, the yellow ribbon symbolizes solidarity with the armed forces.

===Hong Kong===
The yellow ribbon is used as a symbol for Hong Kong&#x27;s pro-democracy movement and their demands for universal suffrage, as it has long been the official colour of many suffrage organisations, stemming from the women&#x27;s suffrage campaign in the US in the 1860. The yellow ribbon was first used by pro-democracy camp legislators in a press conference after the December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong, and was later adopted as a symbol among protestors during the 2014 Hong Kong protests.

The yellow ribbon is used in many ways, in particular on social media, for demonstrating solidarity with the pro-democracy protestors, and it became more widely used after Hong Kong police fired tear gas and used pepper spray (capsaicin) to dissipate the students and protesters who were occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty on 28 September 2014, in the 2014 Hong Kong protests. The meaning of yellow ribbon in Hong Kong has also extended to symbolise discountenance of the abuse of violence by the Hong Kong Police against pro-democracy protestors in the 2014 protests.

In 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, yellow ribbon is symbolised as supporting pro-democracy protestors again, which is opposed to blue ribbon, and derives &quot;Yellow economic circle&quot;.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, yellow ribbon is used as a symbol to show solidarity and sympathy for the victims of the riots and chaos in Indonesia May 13–15, 1998, who were mostly Indonesian Chinese.

===Israel===
Starting in August 2008, in the northern Israeli region of Galilee, yellow ribbons were tied to the left side mirrors of civilian cars as a symbol of the hope of the Israelis to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit who was held captive for five years in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. Shalit was born and raised in the small village of Mitzpe Hila in the area. He has since been released and returned to Israel.

After the commencement of the Israel-Hamas War in October 2023, families of hostages taken into Gaza launched a project of handing out yellow ribbons on the streets of Israel. Later on, sympathizers outside of Israel adopted the symbol in order to call for the hostages return.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum introduced the yellow ribbon in 2023 as a symbol to call for the return of hostages currently held by Hamas, occasionally appearing alongside the slogan &quot;Bring Them Home Now&quot;. By later in 2024, the yellow ribbon had gained recognition as a symbol calling for the hostages&#x27; release.

===Italy===
In Italy, the yellow ribbon is worn to support the prisoners of war (POWs). It has been used to support the two Italian marines during the diplomatic crisis between Italy and India.

===Japan===
Japan&#x27;s Medal of Honor uses a yellow ribbon to acknowledge professionals who have become public role models.

===Kuwait===
In Kuwait the yellow ribbon is worn to support the prisoners of war (POWs) missing from Kuwait, during the period from the Iraqi invasion in 1990 until the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003. The fall of Baghdad marked the end of the era of Saddam Hussein; afterwards, some Kuwaiti graves were found. On the fourth of July, in speech in Kuwait, the United States ambassador James Larauca pointed out that one of the most priceless reminders of the values of freedom is the yellow ribbon that was held by former U.S. President George W. Bush in reference to the suffering of the families of prisoners of Kuwait in Iraqi prisons.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the yellow ribbon is used as a symbol of &quot;press freedom&quot;.

===New Zealand===
It is also being used as a symbol of solidarity and remembrance for the Pike River miners trapped and killed after the explosion in the mine on 19 November 2010.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the yellow ribbon first gained prominence in the 1980s during the Martial Law era as a symbol of support for opposition leader Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. Inspired by the song Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree (with the song&#x27;s lyrics serving as an allegory of Aquino&#x27;s homecoming after a long period of incarceration and subsequent exile due to his criticism of the Marcos regime), supporters tied yellow ribbons along the streets of Metro Manila to welcome him home from his self-exile in the United States. Aquino never saw the ribbons as he was assassinated while disembarking at Manila International Airport on August 21, 1983. His death led to a series of events that culminated in the 1986 People Power Revolution that overthrew President Ferdinand Marcos. The color yellow was symbolic of the anti-Marcos movement, and eventually became associated with the new President, Aquino&#x27;s widow Corazón Aquino.

The yellow ribbon regained popularity in 2009 as a show of support for an ailing Corazón Aquino. After her death on 1 August 2009, people wore yellow shirts, tied yellow ribbons along the street and added yellow ribbons on photos in social networking sites in mourning. Soon after, it was used by those pushing for Aquino&#x27;s only son, Benigno Aquino III, to run in the May 2010 elections; it was eventually co-opted by his campaign.

In September 2010, wearing a yellow band of electrical tape around the index finger signified support of the &quot;We Are One Filipino Movement&quot;, a Filipino-American rally for Benigno Aquino III at the Plaza de César Chavez in San Jose, California.

The colour is currently associated with the Aquino family and, by extension, the Liberal Party.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the government has initiated an annual Yellow Ribbon Campaign, through the Yellow Ribbon Project, to promote giving ex-convicts a second chance in society. Typically, a person shows his support for ex-convicts by pinning a yellow ribbon on his shirt during the annual campaign held in September. This was probably influenced by its use as a symbol of acceptance in the song &quot;Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree&quot; as stated above.

===South Korea===


In South Korea, the yellow ribbon is a symbol in memory of the victims and families of deceased of the 2014 MV &quot;Sewol&quot; disaster, in which 304 ferry passengers perished.

=== Spain and Catalonia===

==== War of Succession ====
The first well-known reference for the use of yellow cockades or ribbons in Spain is in 1704, when the viceroy of Catalonia Francisco Antonio Fernández de Velasco and Tovar, count of Melgar, banned its partisan use during the War of the Spanish Succession, to stating the side that used may be &quot;creating disagreements within families&quot;.

==== Catalan independence movement ====

In Catalonia, the yellow ribbon started being used in late October 2017 as a symbol of solidarity with the leaders of the two biggest pro-independence organizations, ANC and Òmnium Cultural (Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart respectively), arrested by the Spanish judiciary during the Operation Anubis on accusations of rioting, sedition and rebellion.

In November 2017, the meaning of the ribbon broadened to include the members of the Catalan regional government and the president of the Catalan Parliament, who were arrested by the Supreme Court of Justice for their alleged role in organizing referendum on Catalan independence, that was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court of Spain.

The yellow ribbon is also used to show support for former Catalan leaders in self-imposed exile, or flight from justice, depending on the point of view, including the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and four other regional Ministers, who had fled to Belgium and Scotland to avoid arrest and to seek broader European support for their cause that never arrived, due to the lack of constitutional consistency of their proposals ; as well as Marta Rovira (leader of ERC) and Anna Gabriel (leader of CUP) who fled to Switzerland despite both not being required to appear in court.

FC Barcelona ex-player and coach, and current Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, is one of the most notable figures who has been wearing it.

Sometimes, the yellow ribbon is also used to show support for other individuals that push for the Catalan independence and have faced legal consequences because of it. That includes Tamara Carrasco, Adrià Carrasco and other members of the Committees for the Defense of the Republic.

The Spanish electoral commission (Junta Electoral Central) has taken the position that the yellow ribbon is a political symbol and has sometimes banned its display on public buildings when an election is upcoming; in 2019, the Catalan government changed a yellow ribbon on a banner on its headquarters building in Barcelona to a white ribbon in response to such a ban. Fifty percent of Catalans are against the use of public buildings to carry out political propaganda for the pro-independence parties, and are deprived of their right to political neutrality of the institutions by the regional pro-independence government. Blue ribbons have also been used in this way.

=== Ukraine ===

In Ukraine, the &quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot; resistance movement was created in April 2022, after the start of Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country, within the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. Yellow ribbons were used as a symbol of Ukrainian resistance against the Russian occupation, with the symbol sometimes appearing in graffiti.

===United Kingdom===
In English football, a modified version is sung by Arsenal F.C. fans in FA Cup matches:
::&quot;She wore, she wore, she wore a yellow ribbonShe wore a yellow ribbon in the merry month of MayAnd when I asked her why she wore that ribbonShe said it&#x27;s for the Arsenal and we&#x27;re going to Wembley&quot;

:::&quot;Wembley, Wembley We&#x27;re the famous Arsenal and we&#x27;re going to Wembley.&quot;

The song has particular resonance as Arsenal&#x27;s away colours are often yellow and blue. The song is also used by Manchester United, with the word &#x27;yellow&#x27; replaced by &#x27;scarlet&#x27;, referencing their signature home colour.

A British charity named the Yellow Ribbon Foundation was founded in 2003 to support military veterans.

===United States===
During the Iran hostage crisis, the yellow ribbon was used as a symbol of support for the hostages held at the United States embassy in Tehran. In November 1979, a committee headed by Suzan E. Garrett of the Jaycees ladies service organization in Leitchfield, Kentucky organized a campaign to &quot;Tie A Yellow Ribbon&quot; around public trees as well as encouraging people to wear tied ribbons on lapels in support of the U.S. hostages being held in Iran. She was interviewed on ABC-TV by Ted Koppel on the newly created &quot;Nightline&quot; late-night news program and later by Peter Jennings for ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.

This symbolism continued and gained further recognition in December 1979, when Penelope Laingen, wife of Bruce Laingen who was the most senior foreign service officer being held hostage, tied a yellow ribbon around a tree on the lawn of her Maryland home. The ribbon primarily symbolized the resolve of the American people to win the hostages&#x27; safe release. Yellow ribbons featured prominently in the celebrations of their return home in January 1981.

The yellow ribbon saw renewed popularity in the United States during the Gulf War in the early 1990s. It appeared along with the slogan &quot;support our troops&quot;, in the form of yellow ribbons tied to trees, and countless other contexts. It often had the implied meaning of &quot;bring our troops home&quot; from the Desert Shield and Desert Storm troop deployments. It appeared again during the 2003 invasion of Iraq with similar meanings, most prominently in the form of a yellow ribbon printed on magnetized material and displayed on the outside of automobiles.
The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program (YRRP) uses the yellow ribbon in its logo. YRRP is a Department of Defense-wide effort to promote the well-being of National Guard and Reserve members, their families and communities, by connecting them with resources throughout the deployment cycle. An American charity named the Yellow Ribbon Foundation was founded in 2001 to support military veterans.

The yellow ribbon is also the scholastic symbol adopted by universities and institutions which provide student veteran support through the &quot;Yellow Ribbon Program&quot; and represents a matched financial contribution between that establishment and the U.S. Government to cover tuition costs that the normal Post Montgomery or Post 9/11 GI Bill would not normally cover.

In May 2014, the American Veterinary Medical Association released a series of videos about preventing dog bites. One of the videos explained the practice of tying a yellow ribbon to a dog&#x27;s leash to indicate the dog did not like strangers.

<text>Scanimate is an analog computer animation (video synthesizer) system created by Lee Harrison III of Denver, Colorado. Harrison had developed its predecessor, ANIMAC, which generated used a motion capture system, based on a body suit with potentiometers. In contrast, Scanimate included TV technology. Scanimate&#x27;s successor was called Caesar, and used a digital computer to control the analog system.

The 8 Scanimate systems were used to produce much of the video-based animation seen on television between most of the 1970s and early 1980s in commercials, promotions, and show openings. One of the major advantages the Scanimate system had over film-based animation and computer animation was the ability to create animations in real time. The speed with which animation could be produced on the system because of this, as well as its range of possible effects, helped it to supersede film-based animation techniques for television graphics. By the mid-1980s, it was superseded by digital computer animation, which produced sharper images and more sophisticated 3D imagery.

Animations created on Scanimate and similar analog computer animation systems have a number of characteristic features that distinguish them from film-based animation: The motion is extremely fluid, using all 60 fields per second (in NTSC format video) or 50 fields (in PAL format video) rather than the 24 frames per second that film uses; the colors are much brighter and more saturated; and the images have a very &quot;electronic&quot; look that results from the direct manipulation of video signals through which the Scanimate produces the images.

==How it works==
A special high-resolution (around 945 lines) monochrome camera records high-contrast artwork. The image is then displayed on a high-resolution screen. Unlike a normal monitor, its deflection signals are passed through a special analog computer that enables the operator to bend the image in a variety of ways. The image is then shot from the screen by either a film camera or a video camera. In the case of a video camera, this signal is then fed into a colorizer, a device that takes certain shades of grey and turns it into color as well as transparency. The idea behind this is that the output of the Scanimate itself is always monochrome. Another advantage of the colorizer is that it gives the operator the ability to continuously add layers of graphics. This makes possible the creation of very complex graphics. This is done by using two video recorders. The background is played by one recorder and then recorded by another one. This process is repeated for every layer. This requires very high-quality video recorders (such as both the Ampex VR-2000 or IVC&#x27;s IVC-9000 of Scanimate&#x27;s era, the IVC-9000 being used quite frequently for Scanimate composition due to its very high generational quality between re-recordings).

==Current usage==
Two of the Scanimates are still in use at ZFx studios in Asheville, NC. The original &quot;Black Swan&quot; R&amp;D machine has been updated with more modern power supplies and can produce material in standard or 1080P high definition video. The &quot;white Pearl&quot; machine is the last one produced and is being kept in its original configuration for historical purposes by David Sieg at ZFx inc. The machines are installed in a working production environment with Grass Valley switchers, Kaleidoscope digital video effects systems and Accom digital disk recorders for layering.

<text>Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus (Latin, &#x27;An Anatomical Exercise on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Living Beings&#x27;), commonly called De Motu Cordis, is the best-known work of the physician William Harvey, which was first published in 1628 and established the circulation of blood throughout the body. It is a landmark in the history of physiology, with Harvey combining observations, experiments, measurements, and hypotheses in an extraordinary fashion to arrive at his doctrine. His work is a model of its kind and had an immediate and far-reaching influence on Harvey&#x27;s contemporaries; Thomas Hobbes said that Harvey was the only modern author whose doctrines were taught in his lifetime.

In &quot;De motu cordis&quot;, Harvey investigated the effect of ligatures on blood flow. The book also argued that blood was pumped around the body in a &quot;double circulation&quot;, where after being returned to the heart, it is recirculated in a closed system to the lungs and back to the heart, where it is returned to the main circulation.

== Synopsis ==
This work is a substantial contribution to cardiac physiology, for it introduces into biology the doctrine of circulation of the blood in the seventeenth century. Opposed and obliging work heralding Harvey&#x27;s discovery go back to the thirteenth century, when the pulmonary circulation and gas exchange was proposed by Ibn Al-Nafis. Both long since proven theories are incomplete when studied separately but together form core knowledge of present-day cardiology. In 1553, Michael Servetus said that blood flows from the heart to the lungs, and that it there mixes with air to form the arterial blood which flows back to the heart. Between 1570 and 1590, Cesalpino suggested, in a controversy with Galenists, that the movement of blood was more like a circulation than an oscillation; but this view lacks clarity. In 1603, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Acquapendente published a work clearly describing the valves in the veins and showing that they hinder the flow of blood away from the heart. From 1597 to 1602, Harvey studied arts and medicine at Padua, and made a careful study of the heart and the movement of blood. By 1616, he was presenting in lectures his case for the circulation of the blood, but it was not until 1628 that he published it in his classic work, &quot;De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis&quot;. This book is important both for the discovery of the complete circulation and for the experimental, quantitive and mechanistic methodology which Harvey introduced. He looked upon the heart, not as a mystical seat of the spirit and faculties, but as a pump analyzable along mechanical lines. He also measured the amount of blood which it sent out to the body. He observed that with each beat two ounces of blood leave the heart; so that with 72 heart beats per minute, the heart throws into the system 540 pounds of blood every hour. Where could all this blood come from? The answer seems to be that it is the same blood that is always returning. Moreover, the one-way valves in the heart, like those in the veins, indicate that, following the pulmonary circulation, the blood goes out to all parts of the body through the arteries and returns by way of the veins. The blood thus makes a complete . As Harvey expressed it, &quot;There must be a motion, as it were, in a circle.&quot; There was, however, one stage in the circulation which Harvey was not able to see - that in which the veins and arteries lose themselves by subdivision into the tiny capillary vessels. It was in 1660, three years after Harvey&#x27;s death, that Marcello Malpighi saw the blood moving in the capillaries of a frog&#x27;s lung, and thus supplied the missing link in Harvey&#x27;s proof of the circulation of the blood.

<text>Estonian Air was the flag carrier airline of Estonia between 1991 and 2015. Headquartered in Tallinn it operated scheduled services from Tallinn Airport. Prior to its closure, the airline flew from Tallinn to 11 destinations in Europe.

From 1991 to 1996, and again from 2010, Estonian Air was owned by the Estonian government. In 2010, the Estonian government had purchased the company back from SAS Group to ensure it did not go bankrupt. On 7 November 2015, the European Commission ruled that the government funding given to the company had been in breach of the European Union regulations and must be paid back. Estonian Air, not having such funds, ceased all its operations the next day and immediately entered the process of liquidation. A new state-owned airline, Nordica, entered operations the same day.

== History ==

===Early years===
The airline was established by the Estonian government with aircraft acquired from the defunct local Aeroflot Division.

In 1992, the airline became a member of IATA and the first Boeing 737-500 was delivered in 1995. The company was partially privatised in 1996, with 66% of shares to Maersk Air (49%) and Cresco investment bank (17%). The company leased two Boeing 737-500s to replace its old Soviet planes, and in 1996, after obtaining two more Fokker 50s, it was able to retire the Soviet fleet entirely.

In 2003, Maersk Air sold its shares to SAS and the Fokker 50s were retired. By 2004, the airline had carried its 500,000th passenger.
In March 2007, Estonian Air announced that they will lease another Boeing 737-500 and serve a new destination, Vienna. Estonian Air has leased two Saab 340s and in June 2008 Estonian Air established a new company, Estonian Air Regional. Under that name, it added new destinations from Tallinn to Kuressaare, Stockholm, Helsinki and Vilnius. Later on to Saint Petersburg and to Minsk.

In 2008, three new destinations (Minsk, Munich and Rome) were served and the company announced that it was ordering three Bombardier CRJ900 NG and further 3 options. On 27 November 2008, Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip announced that SAS had approached the Estonian government, urgently requesting a cash injection to save the airline and offering to buy out the government&#x27;s stake in the airline. The Estonian government is reportedly in negotiations with ferry company Tallink to come up with a counter-proposal.

In 2009, Estonian Air gave up its Vienna, Frankfurt and Simferopol routes. The company closed its ground handling division. New destinations from Tallinn were Amsterdam, Berlin and St. Peterburg, new route was Tartu–Stockholm.

===Development since 2010===
In 2010, Estonian Air started cooperation with KLM, announcing the new Tallinn–Vilnius–Amsterdam route (starting from 12 February 2010).
Estonian Air started operating flights to Trondheim 5 September 2011, with 5 weekly flights.
In November 2011, Estonian Air announced reopening flights to Riga, 17 weekly flights starting from 25 March 2012, and to Helsinki, 18 flights weekly starting from 26 March 2012. As well as opening flights to Vienna, 6 weekly starting from 25 March 2012, and to Hannover, 6 weekly flights starting from 2 April 2012. It also announced increased flights to Stockholm, St. Petersburg and Vilnius starting from March 2012 and add extra flights on the Tallinn-Moscow route during the December 2011 holidays.

As of 10 May 2010, the government of Estonia and SAS Scandinavian Airlines have agreed to a transaction where the Estonian government provides an additional 21 million EUR in capital to Estonian Air resulting in the stake of SAS in the carrier to decrease from 49% to 10%. At the same time, the two parties have agreed that the Estonian government gets an option to buy the remaining 10% stake from SAS at a later time between then and 2014. Estonian Air and SAS Scandinavian Airlines will continue to cooperate in the same fashion for the time being. The short-term aim of the government is to become a leading shareholder and to invest in the company to ensure its future, as Estonian Air is strategically important to the state. In September 2010, Estonian Air announced that they have finally signed an agreement with Bombardier, in which two CRJ-900 NextGen aircraft are going to be delivered in the beginning of 2011 (both planes were delivered in January 2011), and a third one in 2012. The agreement with SAS Scandinavian Airlines was signed on 10 September 2010 and it took effect on 27 October 2010 when the Estonian Parliament ratified the 2010 state budget modifications, allocating needed funds for investment. In November 2011, Minister of Economic Affairs Juhan Parts proposed that SAS should follow the state&#x27;s lead in making substantial investments in Estonian Air. SAS Vice-President Sture Stolen however said that this is unlikely: &quot;We have a good and important partnership with them, but it is not our strategy to be part owners in Baltic airlines&quot;.

Estonian Air&#x27;s new CEO and former AirBaltic chief commercial officer Tero Taskila expected the company to be profitable by 2012 after losing money since 2005. According to Taskila, the company already took a big step late in 2011 by clearing up its messy leadership issues. After further poor financial results in 2012, the government of Estonia decided to fire CEO Tero Taskila. From 1 November 2012, the new CEO was Jan Palmér, who has had over 20 years of experience with different airlines in Scandinavia.

===Cessation of operations===
On 8 November 2015, Estonian Air ceased all operations after the European Commission declared the government funding received by the airline illegal which would have forced them to pay back over €85 million. Replacement services on key Estonian Air routes have been established on short notice by the government-supported joint venture Nordic Aviation Group (NAG) under leadership of Adria Airways in joint operations with several European regional carriers.

==Fleet==
As of the airline&#x27;s shutdown on 8 November 2015, Estonian Air had a fleet of 6 aircraft with an average age of 8.2 years – 3 Bombardier CRJ900s, 2 CRJ700s and a single Embraer E-170. The company was phasing out its 4 Embraers with plans to operate with 8-10 Bombardier CRJs.

===Historic fleet===

==Services==
On all flights there were two classes of service:

===Flex Class===
Passengers holding Business or Flexible Economy fare tickets were seated in the forward sections of the one-cabin aircraft.
