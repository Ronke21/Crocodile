It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; for 245 issues published from 1983 to 1988 and initially collected in 27 volumes under the Jump Comics imprint. Set on a post-apocalyptic Earth after a nuclear war, the story centers on a warrior named Kenshiro, the successor of a deadly martial art known as &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot;, which gives him the ability to kill his opponents by striking their secret vital points, which often results in an exceptionally violent and gory death.

&quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; was adapted into two anime television series produced by Toei Animation, which together aired on Fuji TV and its affiliates from 1984 through 1988, comprising a combined total of 152 episodes. It has since expanded into a media franchise, including several anime films, a live-action film, original video animations (OVAs), video games, and a series of spin-offs centering on other characters from the original story. It also has a number of video games and pachinko machines produced by Sega Sammy. A new anime adaptation was announced in September 2023.

English adaptations of the manga were published by Viz Communications as a monthly comic book, and later by Gutsoon! Entertainment as a series of colorized graphic novels, although neither translation was completed. In October 2020, Viz Media announced that they published the title as a series hardcover editions starting in June 2021. English adaptations of other &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; media have been licensed to other companies, including the TV series and the 1986 film.

The manga has sold over 100 million copies, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. The series is considered as one of the most influential manga series of all time.

==Plot==

A worldwide nuclear war sometime in the 1990s has resulted in the destruction of most of civilization, turning the world into a desert wasteland. The remnants of mankind fight over whatever supplies of food and uncontaminated water still remain as the strong prey on the weak. Kenshiro is the successor to &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot;, an ancient martial art of assassination that trains its practitioners to kill from within an opponent&#x27;s body through the use of hidden meridian points. Kenshiro wishes to live his life in peace, but after he is separated from his fiancée Yuria by a jealous rival, he begins his journey to become the savior of the post-apocalyptic world, defending the weak and innocent from the many gangs and organizations that threaten their survival. Along the way, Kenshiro meets a young thief named Bat and an orphaned girl named Lin, who join him as his traveling companions and bear witness to Ken&#x27;s many battles.

Kenshiro&#x27;s many rivals and allies include the six grandmasters of &quot;Nanto Seiken&quot;, a rival assassin&#x27;s art that split into two factions after the nuclear war, as well as his own &quot;Brothers of Hokuto&quot; who trained alongside him for the succession of &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot;. Kenshiro&#x27;s ultimate nemesis is his eldest brother-in-training Raoh, a warrior who broke the law of &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot; by refusing to allow his fists to be &quot;sealed&quot;, killing his master Ryuken and refusing to surrender the succession to Kenshiro. Raoh seeks to conquer the post-apocalyptic world as a warlord under the mantle of &quot;Ken-oh&quot;, the King of the Fist, by challenging every martial artist he sees as a threat. After a long series of battles, Kenshiro emerges victorious over Raoh, who dies peacefully, and peace arrives in the post-apocalyptic world, concluding the first half of the story.

The second half begins several years later after a tyrannical empire under the name of the Celestial Empress has risen to power, oppressing anyone who dares to oppose them. Kenshiro returns from seclusion, joining the now-grown Bat and Lin under the banner of the Hokuto Army. As they fight their way into the Empire&#x27;s capital city, they discover that the Empire has been taken over by the Viceroy Jakoh, a usurper who is keeping the real Celestial Empress captive in his dungeon. The Hokuto Army free the Empress and Jakoh is vanquished shortly afterwards.

However, Lin is taken captive by the remnants of Jakoh&#x27;s forces and is sent off to the mysterious Kingdom of Shura, a brutal land of warriors ruled by three overlords who have all mastered the ways of &quot;Hokuto Ryūken&quot;, a martial art which branched off from the same clan alongside &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot; into the ways of darkness. Kaioh, the head of the three overlords, plans to conquer the post-apocalyptic world in the name of evil by wiping out the followers of &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot;. Kenshiro uncovers the sealed testament of the &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot; founder, Shuken, which holds the secret to overcoming Kaioh&#x27;s ultimate technique. Kenshiro emerges victorious over Kaioh and rescues Lin, leaving her under Bat&#x27;s care. During the final chapters, Kenshiro goes on a journey with Raoh&#x27;s orphaned son Ryu, in order to lead him on the path to become the next &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot; successor, encountering and battling various opponents along the way, before returning to Bat and Lin to protect them from a past enemy.

==Production==
In 1982, 21-year-old manga artist Tetsuo Hara was struggling with his career. His first serialized manga for &quot;Jump&quot;, the motocross racing-themed &quot;Iron Don Quijote&quot;, was discontinued with only 10 issues. A fan of Chinese martial artist and actor Bruce Lee and Japanese action film actor Yūsaku Matsuda as a teenager in the 1970s, he often drew versions of them from memory. Hara had previously pitched the idea of a martial arts manga with a protagonist that combined the appearances and character traits of the two actors to his editor Nobuhiko Horie. But Horie instead convinced Hara to create &quot;Iron Don Quijote&quot;. Now revisiting the martial arts theme, the two realized they needed a secret signature technique, but were at a loss for ideas until Horie browsed a used Chinese book store on Suzuran Street in Jinbōchō, Tokyo. He found an anecdote of a medical student in China, who, after overstimulating an acupressure point in order to help an eye issue, had instead made the condition worse. Horie believed that destroying bodies by attacking pressure points was perfect for a manga, as it allowed someone small to take out a much bigger opponent. He derived the manga&#x27;s title and the name of the technique from a Chinese constellation myth that features two sages, Hokuto and Nanto, the gods of death and life respectively. The editor pictured the manga&#x27;s protagonist, Kenshiro, as the son of Hokuto.

A prototype version of &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; was published as a one-shot story in the April 1983 issue of &quot;Fresh Jump&quot;. It was chosen by readers as the best story in the magazine and featured many of the elements that would later appear in the serialized version, including Kenshiro&#x27;s signature phrase; &quot;You are already dead!&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Fist of the North Star II&quot;, a second one-shot published in the June 1983 issue. Both stories were later collected in the second volume of &quot;Iron Don Quijote&quot; (although the expanded 1995 editions moves the first part of the &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; pilot to the first volume, leaving the second volume with just the second pilot).

The serialized version of &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; began in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on September 13, 1983. Manga author Buronson was assigned to work with Hara as writer of the series. He was given the job after &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; could not come to an agreement with Horie&#x27;s first choice. Buronson liked Hara&#x27;s one-shot version, but insisted a modern-day setting would not work with a martial arts story, so they went with a futuristic one due to the then-popularity of the &quot;Mad Max&quot; film series. The storyline was revamped, with the 1980s present-day setting of the original version replaced by a post-apocalyptic future world, and the protagonist Kenshiro, originally a teenager framed for a murder he did not commit in Hara&#x27;s prototype story, became an older and more stoic hero with a tragic past. For the new setting, Hara drew inspiration from the post-apocalyptic film &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981), the cyberpunk film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s post-apocalyptic Japanese cyberpunk manga &quot;Akira&quot; (1982), and the illustrations of artists Syd Mead and Frank Frazetta. Go Nagai&#x27;s manga series &quot;Violence Jack&quot; (1973 debut), which similarly had a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland setting with biker gangs, anarchic violence, ruined buildings, innocent civilians, tribal chiefs and small abandoned villages, might have been another influence; it has been argued that &quot;Mad Max&quot; itself may have been influenced by &quot;Violence Jack&quot;.

Buronson was astonished by how good Hara&#x27;s art was from the first chapter. He had asked the artist to give Kenshiro seven scars in the shape of the Big Dipper for no reason other than their cool aesthetic. But when they then began thinking of Kenshiro&#x27;s backstory and the reason he wanders the wasteland, Buronson devised that they came from the guy who stole the woman he loved. The story to &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; was planned only two or three chapters in advance, with Horie keeping an eye on the reader feedback. Buronson added three older brothers for Kenshiro. With Jagi representing cruelty, he made Raoh the strongest because he is the oldest, and made Toki the opposite of Raoh; a weak and compassionate man who uses his skills to heal. Buronson had previously looked at writing manga as only a way to make ends meet, but &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; changed that. Before serialization began, he had taken a trip to Cambodia, where the genocidal regime of Pol Pot had recently fallen. Impacted by the human remains he saw piled up everywhere, it influenced his characters and the dialogue he wrote for them; the latter becoming a signature of the series. Hara was inspired by the &quot;Ultraman&quot; and &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; series to create interesting enemy designs. &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; is known for the unique death cries shouted by enemies as they die, such as &quot;&quot;Abeshi&quot;, &quot;Hidebu&quot;, and &quot;Tawaba&quot;&quot;. These were coined by Hara, who, with complete freedom to draw the action scenes, explained that he used them in order to try to add a bit of comedy to make the death scenes easier to digest. He had grown up with the strange words used in Fujio Akatsuka&#x27;s manga, but the copy-editors of &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; would often &quot;correct&quot; his own made-up words, which annoyed him.

Hara and Buronson did not see each other much during serialization and never had meetings directly about work. Instead, Horie acted as go-between for the two. Hara struggled to draw 20 pages a week and described being so &quot;burned out&quot; that he did not bathe for three or four days. He said he viewed Horie as the &quot;devil&quot;, as the editor did not praise him and would instead hand him the script for the next chapter immediately after he completed the previous one. Similarly, Buronson said that Horie never compromises, and that he felt like hitting the editor many times. However, Hara admitted that by not praising him, Horie helped him succeed as an artist, as he is personally the type of person who needs someone to yell at him. Originally, Hara and Buronson were contracted to do &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; for a three-year run, but due to its popularity and the publisher&#x27;s demand, it was extended to a five-year run.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, written by Buronson and illustrated by Tetsuo Hara, premiered in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on September 13, 1983, and was serialized until August 8, 1988, lasting 245 issues. Its chapters were collected in 27 volumes, published under Shueisha&#x27;s Jump Comics imprint from March 9, 1984, to March 10, 1989. During the 1990s, Shueisha reprinted the series in a 15-volume hardcover edition from 1991 to 1992, as well as a 15-volume edition from 1997 to 1998. The &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; copyrights would be transferred over to Coamix, a company founded in June 2000 by Nobuhiko Horie after he left Shueisha. A 14-volume edition was published by Shogakukan in 2006, under the &quot;Big Comics Selection&quot; imprint, featuring the original water-colored artwork from the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; serialization, as well as almost all of the original opening pages that were omitted in earlier editions, although it lacked the added artwork featured in previous collected editions that were drawn to replace ad spaces. To celebrate the series&#x27; 30th anniversary, Tokuma Shoten re-published the series in an &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;, comprising eighteen volumes that were published from September 20, 2013 to July 19, 2014. This edition features new cover illustrations by Hara and include an additional chapter in the 11th volume (see below).

====English translations====
In 1989, Viz Communications published the first sixteen chapters of &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; in English as an eight-issue monthly comic. These were later reprinted in a single graphic novel collection in 1995. During the same year, Viz resumed publication of the series as a monthly comic until 1997, lasting eighteen issues (adapting chapters 17–44), divided into three parts. This second run was subsequently republished in three additional graphic novel volumes titled &quot;Night of the Jackal&quot;, &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. Viz&#x27;s version featured mirrored artwork with translated sound effects and other retouched details.

In 2002, a second English adaptation was published by Gutsoon! Entertainment under the title of &quot;Fist of the North Star: Master Edition&quot;, which retained the original right-to-left orientation but featured digitally colored artwork. Each volume from the fourth one and onward featured new cover illustrations by Hara that were made specifically for the &quot;Master Edition&quot;. The &quot;Master Edition&quot; ceased publication only a year after its start in 2003, lasting only nine volumes due to Gutsoon!&#x27;s withdrawal from the North American market. These colorized editions were translated back to the Japanese market, but only four volumes were published.

In 2020, Viz Media announced a print and digital publication of the manga in hardcover editions, adapted from the 2013 ultimate editions. The first volume was released on June 15, 2021.

===Video games===

Numerous video game titles based on the &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; have been produced since the 1986 release of the Enix adventure game, simply titled &quot;Hokuto no Ken&quot; for the PC-88. The earlier games in the franchise were released by Sega for the Mark III and Mega Drive and by Toei Animation for Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom, Game Boy and Super Famicom. These titles included side-scrolling action games, role-playing video games and competitive-style fighting games. The two Sega titles were stripped of the license and rebranded for the international market under the titles of &quot;Black Belt&quot; for the Master System and &quot;Last Battle&quot; for the Sega Genesis. Two Toei titles, namely &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; (a localized version of the Famicom&#x27;s &quot;Hokuto no Ken 2&quot;) for the NES released by Taxan Soft in 1989 and &quot;Fist of the North Star: 10 Big Brawls for the King of Universe&quot; for the Game Boy released by Electro Brain in 1991, had American releases with the license intact.

Further games were released for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS, among other platforms. In 2000, Konami released an arcade game based on the franchise titled &quot;Fighting Mania&quot;. Another arcade game, a 2D fighting game simply titled &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, was produced by Sega and Arc System Works in 2005. Both of these games saw international distributions, although the PS2 version of the fighting game was released exclusively in Japan. Tecmo Koei produced a &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; spin-off focusing on the events from the first half of the manga, titled &quot;Fist of the North Star: Ken&#x27;s Rage&quot;, for the PlayStation 3. It which was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in 2010. A sequel, &quot;Fist of the North Star: Ken&#x27;s Rage 2&quot;, expanded on the first game and incorporated the events from the second half of the manga. It was released in Japan in 2012 and in North America in 2013. In 2018, Sega released &quot;Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise&quot; for the PlayStation 4. It was developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, and features gameplay elements and voice actors from their flagship series, &quot;Yakuza&quot;. Rather than adapting the manga like previous games, &quot;Lost Paradise&quot; tells an original story that significantly diverges from the events of the manga. A &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; version of &quot;Fitness Boxing&quot; for Nintendo Switch was released in Japan on December 22, 2022, and was released in the West on March 2, 2023.

The city of Hokuto, Hokkaido, collaborated with the series to commemorate its 40th anniversary in 2023 by hosting exhibitions, events, and selling merchandise.

It also had an influence on video games. The name of &quot;Famicom Shinken&quot;, the irregularly published video game section of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1985 to 1988, was partly named after &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;″s &quot;Hokuto Shinken&quot;. Its writer Yuji Horii also had the idea to use a video game rating system based on a famous onomatopoeia from the manga. Technōs Japan game designer Yoshihisa Kishimoto cited &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; as an influence on the setting and art style of the beat &#x27;em up game &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1987), which had a disaster-ridden city. The manga has also been credited with originating the fatality finishing move concept which later appeared in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series of fighting games.

The 1980s animated adaptation was controversial in France, particularly among those who feared anime in general was corrupting French youth. Politician Ségolène Royal was among its most prominent critics, lambasting its recidivist violence in her book &quot;Le Ras-le-Bol des Bébés Zappeurs&quot; (Fed Up of Baby Channel-Zappers).

===Internet memes===
In the 2010s, Kenshiro&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru&quot; (&quot;You Are Already Dead&quot;) became one of the most popular anime-based Internet memes. In September 2017, music producer deadman 死人 (Noah Ryan Murphy) released the song &quot;Omae Wa Mou&quot; which references the meme and samples the Japanese song &quot;Tiny Little Adiantum&quot; (2013) from the &quot;Touhou Project&quot; video game music album &quot;Toho Bossa Nova 2&quot;. The rapper Lil Boom produced his own version of the song called &quot;Already Dead&quot; three months later. In 2019, &quot;Omae Wa Mou&quot; went viral on TikTok and topped Spotify&#x27;s Viral 50 chart, before being taken off the chart after being struck with a copyright claim.

<doc id="519124" wikidata="Q741936" url="?curid=519124" title="Low-key lighting">
<text>Low-key lighting is a style of lighting for photography, film or television. It is a necessary element in creating a chiaroscuro effect. Traditional photographic lighting (three-point lighting) uses a key light, a fill light and a back light for illumination. Low-key lighting often uses only a key light, optionally controlled with a fill light or a simple reflector.

Low key light accentuates the contours of the subject by throwing areas into shade while a fill light or reflector may illuminate the shadow areas to control contrast. The relative strength of key-to-fill, known as the lighting ratio, can be measured using a light meter. Low key lighting has a higher lighting ratio, e.g., 8:1, than high-key lighting, which can approach 1:1.

==Examples in film==
The term &quot;low key&quot; is also used in cinematography and photography to refer to any scene with a high lighting ratio, especially if there is a predominance of shadowy areas. It tends to heighten the sense of alienation felt by the viewer, hence is typically used in dramas, film noir, and horror films.

Some classic noir films that have used the technique include &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, and others. In &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, lamps are frequently used as light sources and often only illuminate certain details in a scene, creating sharp silhouettes and providing a stark lighting contrast for much of the film. Specific examples of the technique’s use regarding the lamps occur whenever Philip Marlowe (played by Humphrey Bogart) has to place a phone call to the police. He turns on a lamp every time he does so, indicating his return to the side of the “good guys.”

In &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, the lighting in Walter Neff’s (played by Fred MacMurray) confession scenes underscores the murder which he is confessing to, and suggests a “dark” aspect to his character. In addition, low key lighting appears in the film in numerous other instances, such as the scenes taking place in Phyllis’s (played by Barbara Stanwick) house, more specifically when either Neff or Phyllis is alone or together within the home.
The chiaroscuro effect the technique often created was also used liberally in classic noir. An example of such a filmmaking choice can be seen in the 1940 film noir &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot;, which used the lighting contrast to highlight the fantastical qualities of the environment. Chiaroscuro and by extension low key lighting was also used to great effect in German expressionist cinema, widely considered a forerunner of film noir. 
Modern neo-noir films such as &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; have also employed the tactic to great effect, often using the technique to evoke a sense of unease. Other modern noir-adjacent films and television shows that have used the technique include &quot;Joker&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot; and the films of David Fincher, director of &quot;Seven&quot;. Fincher in particular makes extensive use of limited light sources, often highlighting an invisible conflict between “light [and] darkness” by effectively controlling the light of his scenes.

Cinematographers such as Roger Deakins also use aspects of low key lighting in their scene composition. In particular, Deakins and others used natural light as much as they could, which often had the effect of creating low key lighting when filmed in low light conditions. Examples of films Deakins has worked on include &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. More recent examples include the films of David Lowery and Andrew Droz Palermo, the latter of whom praises natural low-key lighting techniques for their “painterly and expressionistic” quality. Cinematographer Devan Scott also notes the influence of digital technology in creating these films as well as its increased use in the industry by citing the technology’s relative ease of use, and stating that the increase in dark lighting is “a trend enabled by tools” first and foremost.
The proliferation of such techniques has been criticized by viewers in several instances. For example, many viewers reacted poorly to a dimly-lit final battle in the finale of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, despite series cinematographer Fabian Wagner stating that the darkness was intentional, claiming the “show runners decided that [the battle] had to be a dark episode.” Other modern examples of viewer backlash include films such as &quot;Arrival&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as TV shows such as &quot;Ozark&quot; and &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

<doc id="519126" wikidata="Q37811" url="?curid=519126" title="German Wirehaired Pointer">
<text>The German Wirehaired Pointer is a medium to large-sized griffon type breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for versatile hunting. It became a leading gun dog in Germany in the later part of the 20th century. It is the result of the careful mixing and crossing of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, German Shorthaired Pointer, German Roughhaired Pointer, and the hunting Pudelpointer in the late 19th century.

==History==
The German Wirehaired Pointer traces its origins back to 1880. The breed originated in Germany, where Baron Sigismund von Zedlitz und Neukirch was a leading breeder, wanting to create a versatile hunting dog that would work closely with either one person or a small party of persons hunting on foot in varied terrain; from the mountainous regions of the Alps, to dense forests, to more open areas with farms and small towns. The breed the Germans desired had to have a coat that would protect the dogs when working in heavy cover or in cold water, yet be easy to maintain. Careful crosses of the German pointer with many other breeds. Sources differ on the exact lineage, though the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, Pudelpointer, Stichelhaar, and Deutscher-Kurzhaar are commonly accepted as the most likely contributors. This is a dog that can fully respond to the needs of its hunter. The goal was to develop a wire-coated, medium-sized dog that could:
*Search for, locate and point upland game
*Work both feather and fur with equal skill and retrieve water fowl
*Be a close-working, easily trained gun dog
*Be able to track and locate wounded game
*Be fearless when hunting &quot;sharp&quot; game such as fox
*Be a devoted companion and pet; and
*Be a watchdog for its owner&#x27;s family and property.

All &quot;drahts&quot; must meet rigorous hunt and physical evaluations before being eligible for breeding. In addition to searching and pointing, these tests include the tracking and recovery of all game including wounded game such as fox, rabbit, deer and boar, which may not be required of a dog that hunts birds predominantly.

For upland (i.e. non-waterfowl) bird work, many GWPs have distinguished themselves with all-breed Field Championships and Master Hunter titles. When purchasing a working GWP, attention needs to be paid to identifying breeders that place emphasis on all aspects of the versatile hunting dog. Among these breeders can be found accomplished dogs including Dual Championships (both field and show).

== Description ==

===Appearance===

The German Wirehaired Pointer is a well muscled, medium to large-sized dog of distinctive appearance. Balanced in size and sturdily built, the breed&#x27;s most distinguishing characteristics are its weather resistant, wire-like coat and its facial furnishings. Typically pointer in character and style, the German Wirehaired Pointer (GWP) is an intelligent, energetic and determined hunter. The tail is typically docked to two-fifths of the natural length. In countries where docking is prohibited the tail should be of sufficient length to reach down to the hocks. Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. This dog can have a similar appearance and therefore is sometimes confused with the Spinone Italiano, Český Fousek, or Wirehaired Pointing Griffon.

====Coat====
The functional wiry coat is the breed&#x27;s most distinctive feature. A dog must have a correct coat to be of correct type. The coat is weather resistant and water-repellent. The undercoat is dense enough in winter to insulate against the cold but is so thin in summer as to be almost invisible. The distinctive outer coat is straight, harsh, wiry and flat lying, and is from one to two inches in length. The outer coat is long enough to protect against the punishment of rough cover, but not so long as to hide the outline of the dog. On the lower legs the coat is shorter and between the toes it is of softer texture. On the skull the coat is naturally short and close fitting. Over the shoulders and around the tail it is very dense and heavy. The tail is nicely coated, particularly on the underside, but devoid of feather. Eyebrows are of strong, straight hair. Beard and whiskers are medium length. The hairs in the liver patches of a liver and white dog may be shorter than the white hairs. A short smooth coat, a soft woolly coat, or an excessively long coat is to be severely penalized when showing. While maintaining a harsh, wiry texture, the puppy coat may be shorter than that of an adult coat. The coat of the puppy should be shorter than 1 inch the adult coat should be kept at 1 inch long.

====Gait====
The dog should be evaluated at a moderate gait. The breed standard is that the movement is free and smooth with good reach in the forequarters and good driving power in the hindquarters. The topline should remain firm.
===Color===
The colors are liver (brown) and white or black and white ticked usually with some solid patches, and solid liver (brown) with or without a white chest patch.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

<doc id="519129" wikidata="Q5283436" url="?curid=519129" title="District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment">
<text>The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would have given the District of Columbia full representation in the United States Congress, full representation in the Electoral College system, and full participation in the process by which the Constitution is amended. It would have also repealed the Twenty-third Amendment, which granted the District of Columbia the same number of electoral votes as that of the least populous state, but gave it no role in contingent elections.

The amendment was proposed by the U.S. Congress on August 22, 1978, and the legislatures of the 50 states were given seven years to consider it. Ratification by 38 states was necessary for the amendment to become part of the Constitution; only 16 states had ratified it when the seven-year time limit expired on August 22, 1985. This proposed constitutional amendment is the most recent one to have been sent to the states for their consideration.

==Text==
==Legislative history==
Representative Don Edwards of California proposed House Joint Resolution 554 in the 95th Congress. The United States House of Representatives passed it on March 2, 1978, by a 289–127 vote, with 18 not voting.

===Senate debate===
The Senate considered the amendment on August 22, 1978. It had considerable bipartisan support, with both Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D–WV) and Minority Leader Howard Baker (R–TN) pressing for its passage. Debate centered on the Founding Fathers&#x27; original intentions for the capital city, the morality of denying 700,000 American citizens congressional representation, and the constitutionality of the proposal.

Support for the amendment came from across the political spectrum, though liberal Democrats were its most visible defenders. Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont rebutted arguments from conservatives that extending full voting rights to D.C. was unfair to rural states. Citing his state&#x27;s rural nature, Leahy asserted that the proposal was not &quot;a case of rural versus urban,&quot; but rather about &quot;simple justice, overdue justice.&quot; Alaska Democrat Mike Gravel argued that the principles of democracy triumph over policies, expressing his support for the proposal despite the likelihood of the District&#x27;s representatives &quot;voting against the Alaskan position on d-2 land&quot; and encouraging &quot;more government rather than more implementation through the private sector.&quot;

Several Republicans also spoke out in support. Michigan&#x27;s Robert P. Griffin noted the United States&#x27; unusual treatment of D.C., stating, &quot;In only one other country in the world—Brazil—are residents of the capital city denied representation in their national legislature.&quot; Edward Brooke of Massachusetts brought up his Washington upbringing in expressing his support for the amendment, while Bob Dole reminded colleagues that the GOP had included full voting representation for the District of Columbia in its party platform adopted at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut went so far as to argue that the proposed amendment was not enough, instead advocating for the District of Columbia&#x27;s admission as a state.

One particularly notable supporter of the amendment was Strom Thurmond (R–SC), notorious for his longtime support of racial segregation. Reflecting his gradual shift toward more moderate views on race, he supported the amendment despite the District of Columbia&#x27;s Black-majority population. Noting the United States&#x27; commitment to exemplifying the ideals of democracy, he asked, &quot;How can we do that when three-quarters of a million people are not allowed to have voting representation in the capital city of this Nation?&quot;

Opposition to the amendment, meanwhile, came almost exclusively from conservatives. Ted Stevens (R–AK) was a particularly vocal foe: 

Other opponents of the amendment proposed more serious compromises. Mississippi Democrat John C. Stennis advocated for giving the District only one senator, while Oklahoma&#x27;s Dewey F. Bartlett tried to alter the amendment to assure that Congress could not exercise committee oversight of D.C. There was considerable discussion of retroceding the District of Columbia back into Maryland, though Maryland Senators Charles Mathias and Paul Sarbanes quickly doused the idea.

Orrin Hatch alleged that the proposal contradicted Article V of the United States Constitution, which guarantees that &quot;no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.&quot; Hatch claimed this meant that all 50 states would have to approve the amendment. In a blistering retort, Ted Kennedy said, &quot;It fails in terms of logic. How can a constitutional amendment be unconstitutional?&quot;

The amendment ultimately passed with the support of 48 Democrats and 19 Republicans. Exactly 80% of the Democratic caucus voted for the amendment, while Republicans split evenly. The chamber&#x27;s sole independent, Harry F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia, voted nay.

===Vote in the legislatures===
With that, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. The Congress, via Section 4, included the requirement that ratification by three-fourths (38) of the states be completed within seven years following its passage by the Congress (i.e., August 22, 1985) in order for the proposed amendment to become part of the Constitution. By placing the ratification deadline in the text of the proposed amendment the deadline could not be extended without a separate amendment to the Constitution. This was in contrast to the ratification deadline of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was restricted by statute and not the amendment itself, and which later became the subject of legal debate.

==Ratification history==
Ratification by the legislatures of at least 38 of the 50 states by August 22, 1985, was necessary for the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment to become part of the Constitution. During the seven-year period specified by Congress it was ratified by only 16 states and so failed to be adopted. The amendment was ratified by the following states:

#New Jersey on September 11, 1978
#Michigan on December 13, 1978
#Ohio on December 21, 1978
#Minnesota on March 19, 1979
#Massachusetts on March 19, 1979
#Connecticut on April 11, 1979
#Wisconsin on November 1, 1979
#Maryland on March 19, 1980
#Hawaii on April 17, 1980
#Oregon on July 6, 1981
#Maine on February 16, 1983
#West Virginia on February 23, 1983
#Rhode Island on May 13, 1983
#Iowa on January 19, 1984
#Louisiana on June 24, 1984
#Delaware on June 28, 1984

The text of the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment states that it will be &quot;inoperative&quot; if ratified past the original seven-year deadline. Therefore, if the necessary 38 states ratify the amendment in the future, it will be added to the Constitution but have no effect.

==Effects had it been adopted==

Had it been adopted, this proposed amendment would have allowed the District of Columbia and its population to participate in federal institutions on equal footing with the states, but it would not have made the district into a state, nor affected Congress&#x27;s authority over it. The District of Columbia would have been given full representation in both houses of Congress, so that it would have two senators and a variable number of representatives based on population.

The proposed amendment would also have repealed the twenty-third amendment, which does not allow the district to have more electoral votes &quot;than the least populous State&quot;, nor does it grant the District of Columbia any role in contingent elections of the president by the House of Representatives (or of the vice president by the Senate). In contrast, this proposed amendment would have provided the district full participation in presidential (and vice presidential) elections.

Finally, the proposed amendment would have allowed the Council of the District of Columbia, the Congress, or the people of the district (depending on how the amendment would have been interpreted) to decide whether to ratify any proposed amendment to the Constitution, or to apply to the Congress for a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, just as a state&#x27;s legislature can under the Constitutional amendment process laid out in Article V of the Constitution.

<doc id="519130" wikidata="Q795166" url="?curid=519130" title="List of regions of Canada">
<text>The list of regions of Canada is a summary of geographical areas on a hierarchy that ranges from national (groups of provinces and territories) at the top to local regions and sub-regions of provinces at the bottom. Administrative regions that rank below a province and above a municipality are also included if they have a comprehensive range of functions compared to the limited functions of specialized government agencies. Some provinces and groups of provinces are also quasi-administrative regions at the federal level for purposes such as representation in the Senate of Canada. However regional municipalities (or regional districts in British Columbia) are included with local municipalities in the article List of municipalities in Canada.

==National regions==
The provinces and territories are sometimes grouped into regions, listed here from west to east by province, followed by the three territories. Seats in the Senate are equally divided among four regions: the West, Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes, with special status for Newfoundland and Labrador as well as for the three territories of Northern Canada (&#x27;the North&#x27;). This is the only regional scheme that has any legal status or function. Regional representation on the Supreme Court of Canada is governed more by convention than by law. Quebec is the only region with a legally guaranteed quota of three judges on the bench. The other regions are usually represented by three judges from Ontario, two from Western Canada (typically but not formally one from British Columbia and one from the Prairie Provinces) and one from Atlantic Canada. The three territories do not have any separate representation on the Supreme Court.

Statistics Canada uses the six-region model for the Geographical Regions of Canada. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada uses the five-region model, while seven regions are commonly used for polling. The various models are derived from the three-region scheme by progressively subdividing the western and eastern regions (the northern region is the same for all models) into smaller and smaller units consisting of provinces or groups of provinces. If the models are not treated as mutually exclusive, eight distinct national regions can be identified when the three western regions of the seven region scheme are combined with the two Atlantic regions of the Senate method and the Ontario, Quebec, and Northern regions common to both schemes.

==Inter-provincial regions==
An inter-provincial region includes more than one province or territory but does not usually include the entirety of each province or territory in the group. However, the geographic or cultural features that characterize this type of region can sometimes lead to the relevant provinces or territories being seen as regional groups like British Columbia-Yukon and Alberta-Northwest Territories.

===Linguistic===

*French Canada, centred in Quebec but with scattered populations in Manitoba, Ontario, and the Maritimes that are increasingly part of...
*The Bilingual Belt, a portion of Canada where both English and French are regularly spoken: Northeastern Ontario, Southeastern Ontario, the Ottawa Valley, the Island of Montreal, the Eastern Townships of Quebec and northern and eastern New Brunswick
*English Canada, sometimes known as the &quot;Rest of Canada&quot;, with Quebec usually excluded despite the presence of scattered English speaking populations in the southern part of the province which are increasingly part of the Bilingual belt 
*Inuit Nunangat, a large region of northern Canada populated mainly by the Inuit, the majority of whom do not claim either English or French as their first language

===Primary, secondary, and local geographic===

*Arctic Archipelago, a large group of Canadian islands in the Arctic Ocean that lies partly in Nunavut, partly in the Northwest Territories, and one, Herschel Island, that is part of Yukon.
**Arctic Cordillera, a very long, broken chain of mountain ranges extending along the northeastern flank of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from Ellesmere Island to the northernmost part of the Labrador Peninsula in northern Labrador and northern Quebec
*Canadian Cordillera which links most of British Columbia and Yukon with some smaller adjacent areas of Alberta and the Northwest Territories to form a single region of mountains and plateaus
**Taiga Cordillera that includes much of Northern Yukon Territory and an adjacent area of the Northwest Territories
**Boreal Cordillera that links northwestern British Columbia with Southern Yukon
**Pacific Maritime Cordillera that includes the west coast of British Columbia and the southwest corner of Yukon
**Montane Cordillera that includes the central and southern interior of British Columbia and the Rocky Mountains that extend partly into Alberta
*Interior Plains of western Canada, which extend from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Canada-US border east of the Canadian Cordillera and west of the Canadian Shield; links the Mackenzie Valley with the Canadian prairie.
**Southern Arctic Plains that includes the arctic coast of Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and an adjacent part of Nunavut
**Taiga Plains that include parts of northeastern Yukon, the Northwest Territories, northeastern British Columbia, and northwestern Alberta
**Boreal Plains, which links parts of northern British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan with part of Central Manitoba and a small part of the Northwest Territories
***Peace River Country, a valley area of parkland and boreal plain that links parts of northern British Columbia and northern Alberta as a part of the larger Boreal Plains region
**Aspen Parkland, a long but relatively narrow transitional region in the Prairie Provinces that separates the boreal forests of the north from the prairie grasslands further south
**The Prairies, including the grasslands and the Palliser&#x27;s Triangle that links the main agricultural regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
***Cypress Hills that links the hilly areas of southern Alberta with their counterparts in southern Saskatchewan
*Canadian Shield, a vast region centred around Hudson Bay that includes parts of every province except British Columbia and the Maritimes, and parts of every territory except Yukon
**Northern Arctic Shield, includes the Boothia and Melville Peninsulas of Nunavut and the northwestern tip of Quebec.
**Southern Arctic Shield, parts of the Canadian Shield separated by Hudson Bay and located mostly in Nunavut and the most northerly region of Quebec
**Taiga Shield, parts of the Canadian Shield located west of Hudson Bay from the Northwest Territories to the far northern fringe of the Prairie Provinces, and east of Hudson Bay and James Bay from Quebec to Labrador 
**Boreal Shield, located mostly south of Hudson Bay and James Bay from northeastern Alberta to southeastern Labrador
**Southern Boreal Shield, a transitional region in Central Ontario and the west-central part of Quebec that separates the boreal forests of the north from the mostly mixed-leaf forests further south
*Hudson Bay Lowland, a large wetland that extends from northeastern Manitoba across the far north of Ontario into northwestern Quebec
*Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands, a low lying region that comprises a section of southern Ontario and extends along the St. Lawrence River to the Strait of Belle Isle and the Atlantic Ocean
**Quebec City–Windsor Corridor that links Southern Ontario with Southern Quebec
**Ottawa Valley that links Eastern Ontario with western Quebec, the southern part of which overlaps the Corridor and the Mixedwood Plains
*Appalachian Uplands, an old, partly eroded system of mountain ranges, hills, and plateaus that extends into southeastern Canada from the eastern United States
**Acadia, a largely historical region that links parts of the Maritimes and parts of eastern Quebec within the Appalachian region

===Administrative===
* National Capital Region, a federal administrative region that straddles the Ottawa River on the Ontario-Quebec border and includes the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau.

== Provincial regions ==
The provinces and territories are nearly all sub-divided into regions for a variety of official and unofficial purposes. The geographic regions are largely unofficial and therefore somewhat open to interpretation. In some cases, the primary regions are separated by identifiable transition zones, particularly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario. The largest provinces can be divided into a number of primary geographic regions of comparatively large size (e.g. southern Ontario), and subdivided into a greater number of smaller secondary regions (e.g. southwestern Ontario). The primary and secondary regions in Ontario are mainly non-administrative in nature. However, they tend to be defined as geographic groupings of counties, regional municipalities, and territorial districts, so that the regions are defined by a system or collection of borders that have local administrative importance.

In other large provinces, the primary and secondary geographic regions are defined more strictly by topographical and ecological boundaries. In geographically diverse provinces, the secondary regions can be further subdivided into numerous local regions and even sub-regions. British Columbia has a much greater number of local regions and sub-regions than the other provinces and territories due to its mountainous terrain where almost every populated lake, sound, and river valley, and every populated cape and cluster of small islands can claim a distinct geographical identity. At the other extreme, Prince Edward Island is not divided into any widely recognized geographic regions or sub-regions because of its very small size and lack of large rivers or rugged terrain. New Brunswick&#x27;s small size renders it dividable into local geographic regions only.

Several provinces and territories also have supra-municipal administrative regions. Their borders mostly do not harmonize with the geographic regions, so they are not considered subdivisions or groupings of the latter.

<text>The Douglas F5D Skylancer is a development of the F4D Skyray jet fighter for the United States Navy. Starting out as the F4D-2N, an all-weather version of the Skyray, the design was soon modified to take full advantage of the extra thrust of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 eventually fitted to the Skyray instead of the Westinghouse J40 originally planned.

==Design and development==
Soon the design became too different from the Skyray to be considered just a variation of it, and the aircraft was assigned a new designation as the F5D Skylancer. Almost every part of the airframe was modified, though the basic form remained the same as did the wing shape, though it became much thinner. The wing skinning was reinforced, correcting a problem found in the F4D. The fuselage was 8 ft (2.4 m) longer and area ruled to reduce transonic drag, being thinner in the region of the wing roots. Everything was shaped to reduce drag and increase stability at high speed.

Although the four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon in the wing roots were retained, primary armament was to be missiles or rockets; four AIM-9 Sidewinders or two AIM-7 Sparrows, and/or a battery of spin-stabilized unguided 2 in (51 mm) rockets.

Nine test airframes were ordered, with a 51-aircraft production order to follow. Production aircraft were to be powered by the more powerful J57-P-14 engine, while there was a rejected proposal to use the even more powerful General Electric J79 and variable-geometry inlets in a Mach 2 version.

==Operational history==
The first flight was made by F5D-1 (Bu. No. 139208) on 21 April 1956 and was supersonic; the aircraft proved easy to handle and performed well. After four aircraft had been constructed, however, the Navy cancelled its order. The stated reason was that the aircraft was too similar to the already-ordered Vought F8U Crusader, but it is believed by some historians that politics played as big a part; Douglas was already building a very large proportion of the Navy&#x27;s planes, and giving them the F5D contract would have made it even closer to monopoly. The project test pilot was Lt. Cmdr Alan B. Shepard Jr. whose report stated that it was not needed by the Navy. One F5D crashed during testing by the Navy.

===NASA use===
The four aircraft continued to fly in various military test programs. Two were grounded in 1961 (likely 139209 and 142349 which had been designated for spare parts in 1958), but the other two: F5D-1 (Bu. No. 139208) NASA 212, later becoming NASA 708 and F5D-1 (Bu. No. 142350) NASA 213, later becoming NASA 802 continued to fly. Transferred to NASA in the early 1960s, NASA 212 was used as a testbed for the American supersonic transport program, fitted with an ogival wing platform (the type eventually used on Concorde; data from the program was shared with the European designers), as well as being used as a vision field test platform for the X-20 Dyna-Soar. This aircraft was retired in 1968. NASA 802 was used for simulation of abort procedures for the X-20, because it had a very similar shape and handling characteristics. Following the DynaSoar cancellation, it was used as a chase plane and for various other programs until it was retired in 1970.

==Surviving aircraft==
* BuNo 139208 (NASA 708) still in NASA markings was part of Merle Maine&#x27;s private collection in Ontario, Oregon until 2014. The aircraft currently resides at Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.
* BuNo 142350 (NASA 802) is a part of the Ohio History Connection permanent collection. The aircraft sits on static display outside of the Armstrong Air &amp; Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Neil Armstrong flew the aircraft during the Dyna-Soar research program. This aircraft has returned to static display outside of the museum after undergoing an 8-month restoration in 2017 and 2018.

<text>Captain John Mason (1586–1635) was an English sailor and colonist who was instrumental to the establishment of various settlements in colonial America and is considered to be the &#x27;Founder of New Hampshire&#x27;. 

Mason was born in 1586 at King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, and educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

==Early Career==

In 1610, he was appointed by James I to help reclaim the Hebrides for English-speaking rule, from Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs. He served as Captain of the expedition consisting of two ships of war and two pinnaces. As a reward, he was granted exclusive fishing rights in the North Sea. This was ignored by the Dutch and he was treated as a pirate by the Scots. In 1615, he was arrested, but soon released after the seizure of his ship. 

==Newfoundland==
He was appointed the second Proprietary Governor of Newfoundland&#x27;s Cuper&#x27;s Cove colony in 1615, succeeding John Guy of Bristol, who had resigned. Mason arrived on the island in 1616 and explored much of the territory. He compiled a map of the island and wrote and published a short tract (or &quot;Discourse&quot;) of his findings.

Mason drew up a map of the island of Newfoundland. Published in William Vaughan&#x27;s Cambrensium Caroleia in 1625, the map included previously established placenames as well as new ones such as Bristol&#x27;s Hope and Butter Pots, near Renews. His tract entitled , was published in 1620 by Mason while in England.

In 1620 King James I&#x27;s Privy Council issued Mason a commission and provided him with a ship to suppress piracy in Newfoundland. Mason ceased to be Cuper&#x27;s Cove governor in 1621 and apparently he was not replaced, although the settlement continued to be occupied throughout the seventeenth century.

==Nova Scotia==
Upon returning to England in 1621, Mason consulted with Sir William Alexander about the possibility of establishing settlements on Nova Scotia. 
Alexander obtained a charter for Nova Scotia in September 1621.

==New England==
Captain Mason was granted several land grants describing land in present day New Hampshire and Maine in the years from 1621 - 1631.

In 1622, Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges received a land patent from the Plymouth Council for New England for the territory lying between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers, extending 60 miles inland. In 1629 they divided the grant along the Piscataqua River, with Mason receiving the southern portion. The colony was recharted as the Province of New Hampshire. It included most of the southeastern part of the current state of New Hampshire, as well as portions of present-day Massachusetts north of the Merrimack.

The Plymouth Council granted to Captain Mason the grant of Laconia on Nov. 17, 1629, comprising an inland tract of land of indefinite bounds, intended to describe inland lands behind the tract described in 1622. 

Although Mason never set foot in New England, he was appointed first vice-admiral of New England in 1635. He died that same year while preparing for his first voyage to the new colony.

<doc id="519142" wikidata="Q901234" url="?curid=519142" title="Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (2003 TV series)">
<text>is a Japanese tokusatsu superhero television series based on the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga created by Naoko Takeuchi &amp; Kodansha. It was produced by Toei Company.

&quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; (commonly referred to as PGSM) was first broadcast by Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting, airing on that station in Nagoya and on the Japan News Network nationwide from October 4, 2003 to September 25, 2004. The series was a retelling of the first &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; story arc, albeit with considerable plot divergences.

The opening theme, titled , was performed by J-pop singer Nanami Yumihara under the name .

The series lasted 49 episodes (called &quot;Acts&quot;) and also included two separate made-for-DVD specials.

== Plot ==
In the Dark Kingdom, an organization of great evil, Queen Beryl, her generalsーthe Four Kings of Heavenー, and an amorphous evil power named Queen Metaria reside. They attempt to steal energy so that Beryl can take over the world.

Standing in their way are the Sailor Guardians, five middle-school-aged girls - perky Usagi Tsukino, genius Ami Mizuno, paranormally gifted shrine maiden Rei Hino, tomboyish Makoto Kino, and J-pop idol Minako Aino - are sworn to protect the Princess of the Moon and defeat the Dark Kingdom. Two beings that appear to be sentient, stuffed toy cats, Luna and Artemis, serve as the girls&#x27; mentors. The Guardians also encounter Tuxedo Mask, a jewel thief in search of an immensely powerful, mystical Silver Crystal belonging to the Princess of the Moon.

While searching together for the Princess of the Moon and the Silver Crystal, the initially disparate girls develop a strong bond of friendship. Additionally, Usagi struggles with her feelings for the irksome and mysterious Mamoru Chiba. Later in the series, Metaria and Sailor Moon each get too powerful to be reined in, and the conflict shifts to one in which the Sailor Guardians attempt to postpone the inevitable destruction of the planet Earth.

=== Alterations to the original story ===

While the first few episodes of the television series are based directly on the manga and anime storylines, by the time the introduction of Sailor Jupiter was broadcast, the television show began to spin off in its own direction. Many divergences between the television series and the manga and anime were introduced. Overall, the storylines for television were more character-based and character-driven. They focused more on the girls&#x27; civilian lives and their connection to the past than on action sequences.

One of the most profound changes in the television version was made to the character of Minako Aino, who, rather than being an ordinary girl among the other Sailor Guardians, was portrayed as a famous pop idol. When introduced, she is fighting crime as &quot;Sailor V&quot;, and makes subtle reference to this double life in her music. Her most popular song, , is a Japanese pun: and are pronounced nearly identically. Also, for the television series, Minako was given a debilitating head condition that causes her to have headaches, blurry vision, and fainting spells, which plague her through most of the series. She agrees to have an operation, but dies before the operation can be performed. This introduces a major change to the Sailor Guardian makeup as well, although Minako does later return for the final act.

In addition to plot changes, some updating was made to minor elements of the series, bringing them more in line with modern culture. For example, in the original anime and manga, there were scenes involving Ami and a cassette tape. In the new version, the tape is replaced by a MiniDisc. Instead of a transforming pen and communicators, each Guardian is given a bracelet and a magical camera phone. Also, their secret hideout is not hidden in a video arcade, but rather in a magic karaoke room.

With the new adaptation of the series, certain characters were modified to give it freshness and originality. The new characters included Sailor Luna, Dark Sailor Mercury, and Princess Sailor Moon. A new antagonist, Mio Kuroki, was also introduced.

== Development ==

The popularity of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; musicals contributed to the decision to produce another series of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, and Takeuchi was more closely involved in the production than she was for the anime. The new series was first announced on September 27, 2003, after the final episode of &quot;&quot;.

== Episodes ==
=== Television ===


=== Direct-to-video ===
== DVD specials ==
=== &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Special Act&quot; ===
A sequel to the series, set four years after the defeat of Dark Kingdom, portrays the wedding of Mamoru Chiba and Usagi Tsukino. Before their nuptials they do battle with Mio Kuroki, who has been resurrected and claims to be the new queen of Dark Kingdom. She kidnaps Mamoru and Usagi and intends to force Mamoru to marry her. The &quot;Shitennou&quot; are revived, however, and help their master to defeat Mio&#x27;s monster, Sword and Shield. Meanwhile, the Sailor Guardians, excluding Sailor Mars who is hospitalized with injuries from battling Mio while in her civilian state, use the Moon Sword provided by Queen Serenity to restore their power, enabling them to transform and defeat Mio. The story ends with Usagi and Mamoru&#x27;s wedding, as well as Motoki and Makoto&#x27;s engagement.

=== &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Act Zero&quot; ===
The last special made for the series is a prequel that leads directly to the first episode. Minako Aino meets Artemis and at Christmas becomes Sailor V. She must use her newfound powers to foil a stage magician/jewel thief called Q.T. Kenko and his Killer Girl assistants. Meanwhile, Usagi and her friends decide to dress in their own homemade sailor fuku (Usagi as Sailor Rabbit, Naru as Sailor N, and their other friends, Kanami and Momoko as sailors K and M) in order to scare the thieves away from the jewellery store owned by Naru Osaka&#x27;s mother, only for Usagi to get kidnapped by Kenko. The actors who portray the Four Kings of Heaven are featured as the inexperienced police officer&#x27;s group self-dubbed the &quot;Police Four Kings of Heaven&quot; for comic relief. They consist of Captain Kuroi (Kunzite), Officer Akai (Nephrite), Officer Shiroi (Zoisite), and female Officer Hanako (Jadeite). The story ends with Luna burning through the atmosphere to come to Earth and give Usagi her powers.

==== Mini-episodes ====
&quot;Act Zero&quot; also comes with two mini-episodes. Each one is approximately five minutes long and tells a brief short story. &quot;Hina Afterward&quot; shows what happened to Hina after breaking off her engagement to Mamoru Chiba. &quot;Tuxedo Mask&#x27;s Secret Birth&quot; shows the origin of the Tuxedo Mask persona. It includes a joke-transformation sequence in which, rather than transforming magically, he pulls on his clothes with dramatic flair.

=== &quot;Super Dance Lesson&quot; ===
This is a short video hosted by Luna, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Moon, which instructs the viewer how to perform the dances from different songs from &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;. The dances included are for the songs &quot;Romance&quot; and . Demonstrations are also given for and although no formal instructions are provided for how to dance to them.

=== Kirari Super Live! ===
A Special Live Event occurred on May 2, 2004 at Yomiuri Hall. This Special Event was held for the 1,000 winners of the Sailormoon Campaign (a contest held earlier in the year, in which viewers had to send in UPC symbols to enter). The event combined musical performances, in which the cast members sang and danced to songs from the &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; soundtrack, and a dramatic storyline with spoken dialogue, in which the Sailor Guardians had to stop the Four Kings of Heaven from stealing the energy of the audience members. The concert was recorded and released on DVD. It also included bonus behind-the-scenes footage of the performance and interviews with the cast members.

== Distribution and reception ==
There are several radio programs called &quot;DJ Moon&quot; based on the show that originated from Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting radio and which were broadcast on other radio networks in Japan. The shows were a combination of a radio drama and promotional tool for the TV series, often foreshadowing upcoming events. These shows were later sold on CD.

In addition to the series, there was also a stage musical performance, Kirari Super Live!, by characters on the show. Some footage from the filming of the stage show was used in the television broadcast. A special limited-edition promotional video, Super Dance Lesson, was available for purchase only through order forms found in the magazines &quot;Youchien&quot;, &quot;Mebae&quot;, and &quot;Shougaku Ichinensei&quot; in July 2004.

<doc id="519146" wikidata="Q5283438" url="?curid=519146" title="District of Columbia statehood movement">
<text>The District of Columbia statehood movement is a political movement that advocates making the District of Columbia a U.S. state, to provide the residents of the District of Columbia with voting representation in the Congress and complete control over local affairs.

Since its establishment by the &quot;District Clause&quot; in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United States Constitution, the District of Columbia has been a federal district under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United States Congress. It is currently debated whether the District of Columbia could be made a state by an act of Congress or whether it would require a constitutional amendment. Alternative proposals to statehood include the retrocession of the District of Columbia and voting rights reforms. If the District of Columbia were to become a state, it would be the first state admitted to the union since 1959. (see also 51st state)

As a state, it would rank 49th by population as of 2020 (ahead of Vermont and Wyoming); first in population density as of 2020 (at 11,685 people/square mile compared to the next densest state, New Jersey with 1,207 people/square mile); 51st by area; 34th by GDP as of 2020; first by GDP per capita as of 2019 (at $177,442 it is nearly 2.4 times the next state, Massachusetts at $75,258); first in educational attainment in 2018 (with 59.7% of residents having a bachelor&#x27;s degree and 34.0% having an advanced degree); and 6th in terms of Human Development Index as of 2018.

For most of the modern (1980–present) statehood movement, the new state&#x27;s name would have been the State of New Columbia, although the Washington, D.C., Admission Act passed by the United States House of Representatives in 2020 and 2021 refers to the proposed state as the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth in honor of George Washington and Frederick Douglass.

== History ==

===District Clause of the Constitution===
In the late 18th century, several individuals believed that Congress needed control over the national capital. This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution&#x27;s District Clause, with a maximum area of (i.e., based on a &quot;square&quot; where the sides are no more than &quot;ten miles&quot; long).

The &quot;District Clause&quot; in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United States Constitution states:

In support of the creation of the District of Columbia, Madison wrote in Federalist No. 43 that the residents of the new federal district &quot;will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them&quot;. Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.

===Early discussions of voting rights===
In 1788, the land on which the district was formed was ceded by Maryland. In 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act placing the district on the Potomac River between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President George Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that Virginia had ceded in 1790. That land was returned to Virginia in 1847. The Congress did not officially move to the new federal capital until the first Monday in December 1800. During that time, the district was governed by a combination of a federally appointed board of commissioners, the state legislatures, and locally elected governments.

Within a year of moving to the district, Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 and incorporated the new federal district under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the district&#x27;s residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College and a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest. In January 1801, a meeting of district citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress commenting that as a result of the impending Organic Act &quot;we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected. We shall be reduced to that deprecated condition of which we pathetically complained in our charges against Great Britain, of being taxed without representation.&quot;

Talk of suffrage for the District of Columbia began almost immediately, though it mostly focused on constitutional amendments and retrocession, not statehood. In 1801, Augustus Woodward, writing under the name Epaminondas, wrote a series of newspaper articles in the National Intelligencer proposing a constitutional amendment that would read, &quot;The Territory of Columbia shall be entitled to one Senator in the Senate of the United States; and to a number of members in the House of Representatives proportionate to its population.&quot; Since then more than 150 constitutional amendments and bills have been introduced to provide representation to the District of Columbia, resulting in congressional hearings on more than twenty occasions, with the first of those hearings in 1803. At that time, resolutions were introduced by Congress to retrocede most of District of Columbia to Maryland. Citizens fearful that the seat of government be moved asked that D.C. be given a territorial government and an amendment to the Constitution for equal rights. But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, &quot;the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.&quot;

===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===
The first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it would not be until 1921 that Congress would hold hearings on the subject. Those hearings resulted in the first bill, introduced by Sen. Wesley Livsey Jones (R-WA), to be reported out of committee that would have addressed District representation. The bill would have enabled – though not required – Congress to treat residents of D.C. as though they were citizens of a state.

===Civil rights era and the Twenty-third Amendment, 1950s–1970s===
Congressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District&#x27;s lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the Civil rights movement in the late 1950s. This eventually resulted in the successful passage of the Twenty-third Amendment in 1961, which granted the district votes in the Electoral College in proportion to their size as if they were a state, but no more than the least populous state. D.C. citizens have exercised this right since the presidential election of 1964.

With District citizens still denied full suffrage, members continued to propose bills to address congressional representation. Such bills made it out of committee in 1967 and 1972, to a House floor for a vote in 1976, and in 1978 resulted in the formal proposal of the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment. But that amendment expired in 1985, 22 ratifications short of the needed 38.

===1980s–2015===
Before the D.C. Voting Rights Amendment failed, but when passage seemed unlikely, District voters finally began to pursue statehood. In 1980, former Paulist priest and founder of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, J. Edward Guinan, put statehood on the ballot as an initiative. District voters approved the call of a constitutional convention to draft a proposed state constitution, just as U.S. territories had done prior to their admission as states. The convention was held from February through April 1982. The proposed constitution was ratified by District voters in 1982 for a new state to be called &quot;New Columbia&quot;. In 1987, another state constitution was drafted, which again referred to the proposed state as New Columbia. Since the 98th Congress, more than a dozen statehood bills have been introduced, with two bills being reported out of the committee of jurisdictions. The second of these bills made it to the House floor in November 1993, for the only floor debate and vote on D.C. statehood. It was defeated in the House of Representatives by 277–153.

Under the 1980 proposed state constitution, the district still selects members of a shadow congressional delegation, consisting of two shadow senators and a shadow representative, to lobby the Congress to grant statehood. Congress does not officially recognize these positions. Additionally, until May 2008, Congress prohibited the district from spending any funds on lobbying for voting representation or statehood.

Since the 1993 vote, bills to grant statehood to the district have been introduced in Congress each year but have not been brought to a vote. Following a 2012 statehood referendum in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, political commentators endorsed the idea of admitting both the District and Puerto Rico into the Union.

In July 2014, President Barack Obama became the second sitting president, after Bill Clinton in 1993, to endorse statehood for the District of Columbia. Asked about his opinion on statehood in a town-hall event, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m in D.C., so I&#x27;m for it ... Folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else ... They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented like everybody else. And it&#x27;s not as if Washington, D.C., is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood and I&#x27;ve been for it for quite some time. The politics of it end up being difficult to get it through Congress, but I think it&#x27;s absolutely the right thing to do.&quot; D.C. residents now pay more in taxes than 22 states.

There were no congressional hearings on D.C. statehood for more than 20 years following the 1993 floor vote. But on September 15, 2014, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs held a hearing on bill S. 132, which would have created a new state out of the current District of Columbia, similar to the 1993 bill.

On December 4, 2015, the District of Columbia was granted membership in the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, an advocacy group for people groups and territories which do not receive full representation in the government of the state in which they reside.

===2016 statehood referendum===

On April 15, 2016, District Mayor Muriel Bowser called for a districtwide vote on whether the nation&#x27;s capital should become the 51st state. This was followed by the release of a proposed state constitution. This constitution would make the Mayor of the District of Columbia the governor of the proposed state, while the members of the District Council would make up the proposed House of Delegates. While &quot;New Columbia&quot; has long been associated with the movement, community members thought other names, such as Potomac or Douglass, were more appropriate for the area.

On November 8, 2016, the voters of the District of Columbia voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood, with 86% of voters voting to advise approving the proposal. Although the proposed state name on the ballot sent to voters appeared as &quot;State of New Columbia&quot;, the resolution passed by the D.C. District Council passed in October 2016, weeks before the election, changed the name to &quot;State of Washington, D.C.&quot;, in which &quot;D.C.&quot; stands for &quot;Douglass Commonwealth&quot;, a reference to African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who lived in Washington, D.C. from 1877 to 1895.

===D.C. Admission Act (H.R. 51)===

In March 2017, the District&#x27;s congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the Washington, D.C. Admission Act to propose D.C. statehood in the U.S. House of Representatives. In May 2017, the Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate. These efforts were supported by the activist coalition, 51 for 51.

In February 2019, the House Democratic leadership put its support behind legislation to grant D.C. statehood. H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019, included a nonbinding expression of support, passed 234 to 193 in March 2019 on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.

The George Floyd protests in June 2020 brought attention to situations of racial injustice and President Trump&#x27;s controversial use of the D.C. National Guard (among other forces) to clear protesters from near the White House angered the city government, which, unlike the states in the United States, does not directly control its National Guard. On June 26, 2020, the House of Representatives passed the &quot;Washington, D.C. Admission Act&quot; 232–180 largely along party lines; Collin Peterson and Justin Amash were the only Democrat and Libertarian, respectively, to vote no. It died in the Republican-controlled Senate at the end of the 116th Congress. On January 4, 2021, Delegate Norton reintroduced H.R. 51 early in the 117th Congress with a record 202 co-sponsors.

The Washington, D.C. Admission Act would create the state of &quot;Washington, Douglass Commonwealth&quot; (named after Frederick Douglass). As a state, the Douglass Commonwealth would receive two senators and one representative in the House of Representatives based on population. The admission act would carve out a smaller federal district, dubbed &quot;the Capital&quot;; this would consist of the White House, U.S. Capitol, other federal buildings, the National Mall, and its monuments. The bill included a section creating faster procedures for repealing the Twenty-third Amendment, which grants the district three electoral votes in presidential elections. The bill also repeals Section 21, Title 3 of the US Code, dealing with presidential elections, which for the purposes of the election of the President and Vice President, &quot;State&quot; includes the District of Columbia. Were the Twenty-third Amendment not to be repealed, the small district remaining as the seat of government would retain three Electoral College votes; Congress would need to legislate a means of appointing electors, as the amendment requires, with one possibility being awarding them to the winner of the popular vote. On April 14, 2021, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform voted to pass the bill, paving the way for the House of Representatives to vote on the bill. The House passed the bill on April 22 with a vote of 216–208.

==== S. 51 ====
On January 26, 2021, Tom Carper of Delaware introduced a similar bill, S. 51, &quot;A bill to provide for the admission of the State of Washington, D.C., into the Union&quot; into the United States Senate with a record 38 co-sponsors. Additional co-sponsors signed on, totaling 45 by April 17, all of whom are Democrats or Independents. In January 2025, Eleanor Holmes Norton and Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen reintroduced the bill.

== Arguments for ==

=== Right to govern ===
Advocates of statehood and voting representation for the District of Columbia argue that as U.S. citizens, the District&#x27;s estimated 706,000 residents (more than Wyoming and Vermont) should have the same right to determine how they are governed as citizens of a state. At least as early as 1776, George Mason wrote in the Virginia Declaration of Rights:

Under the constitution, Congress has exclusive power to oversee D.C, which has led to tension in how D.C. appropriates its budget and responds to emergencies. In 2016 Congress rejected an attempt by D.C. to gain full control of its budget, which Congress has historically overseen. Muriel Bowser has also argued that D.C. statehood might have resulted in a swifter response to the January 6 United States Capitol attack since state governors have the power to mobilize their National Guard units.

=== Civil and human rights ===

The district&#x27;s lack of voting representation in Congress has led to the debate on the status of the civil rights of those living there. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which allows U.S. citizens to vote absentee for their home state&#x27;s Congressional representatives from anywhere else in the world, does not apply if a U.S. citizen were to move to the district, meaning those that move to or reside in the area permanently do not have voting representation in Congress.

Since 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Committee report has cited the United States for denying D.C. residents voting rights in alleged violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty the United States ratified in 1992. In 2015, D.C. became a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization.

&quot;Boston Globe&quot; commentator Abdallah Fayyad called anti-statehood arguments &quot;racist&quot;, targeting the district&#x27;s high African-American population. Fayyad noted opponents often implied that Black people couldn&#x27;t be trusted to govern themselves, for example when they pointed to crime and government corruption despite the same problems in states. A report by the Gender Equity Policy Institute (GEPI) details how the system of taxation without full representation for the district&#x27;s residents disproportionately affects people of color and women.

=== Tax arguments ===
Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, citizens of the District of Columbia are subject to all U.S. federal taxes. In the financial year 2007, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.4 billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita. This situation has given rise to the use of the phrase &quot;End Taxation Without Representation&quot; by those in favor of granting D.C. voting representation in the Congress. Since November 2000, the standard Washington, D.C. vehicle license plate has featured some form of the slogan.

In November 2000, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles began issuing license plates bearing the slogan &quot;Taxation without representation&quot;. President Bill Clinton had these plates placed on the presidential limousines shortly before the end of his second term. However, President George W. Bush, in one of his first official acts as president, had the plates removed. The usage of &quot;taxation without representation&quot; plates was restored by President Barack Obama shortly before his second-term inauguration.
President Donald Trump continued to use the plates, though he stated he had &quot;no position&quot; regarding statehood or representation for the district. However, in an interview in 2020, Trump said D.C. statehood would &quot;never happen.&quot;

== Arguments against ==

=== National capital should be independent from state control ===
Before the District&#x27;s founding, James Madison argued in &quot;Federalist&quot; No. 43 that the national capital needed to be distinct from the states to provide for its own maintenance and safety. He wrote, &quot;a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.&quot;

=== Shrunken capital would give the President too much power in elections ===
The proposed statehood movements address concerns that the national capital should be independent of the states by reserving an independent enclave for the federal government buildings. Specifically, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, the statehood legislation supported by the district government since 2017, carves out an enclave within the proposed state known as &quot;The Capital&quot; to act as the new federal district; this Capital would encompass the White House, Capitol Building, Supreme Court Building, and other major federal offices. However, the D.C. Admission Act would not affect the Twenty-third Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that the U.S. capital &quot;shall appoint&quot; at least three members of the Electoral College even though it is not a state. The text of the amendment says that the capital shall choose its electors &quot;in such manner as the Congress may direct&quot;; while the District of Columbia currently chooses its electors based on the Election Day popular vote for president, this is not required by the amendment.

Critics such as Hewitt Pate of the Heritage Foundation have argued that the continuation of the 23rd Amendment would create an absurd result because the Presidential family would be among only 30–50 people living in the smaller Capital, giving them a disproportionate influence on the Capital&#x27;s three electoral votes and thus on the President&#x27;s election or reelection. The D.C. Admission Act attempts to address this issue by repealing the congressionally established laws that control how the District of Columbia chooses its Electoral College members, but the Congressional Research Service has concluded that even with this provision, courts would likely find that the 23rd Amendment still grants three electoral votes to the smaller Capital.

In addition, the D.C. Admission Act would require Congress to quickly take up the issue of repealing the 23rd Amendment. However, actual repeal of the amendment itself would still require approval by three-quarters of the states after the proposed repealing amendment is approved by Congress, as required by Article V of the Constitution.

== Alternative proposals to statehood ==

Alternative proposals to statehood have been proposed to grant the district varying degrees of greater political autonomy and voting representation in Congress. Most proposals generally involve treating the District of Columbia more like a state or allowing Maryland to take back the land it donated to form the district.

=== Retrocession ===

In a process known as retrocession, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland or given to Virginia, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the United States Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court building. This would require agreement between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly or Virginia General Assembly. If the district were returned to Maryland or given to Virginia, District residents would gain voting representation in Congress as residents of Maryland or Virginia. Retrocession could also alter the idea of a separate national capital as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. However, retrocession is unpopular among D.C. residents. In addition, under any retrocession proposals, the exclusion of small tracts of land as a rump federal district would give the minimal number of people who live on those lands (possibly exclusively those living at the White House) three electoral votes in each U.S. presidential election, were the 23rd Amendment not to be repealed.

A proposal related to retrocession was the &quot;District of Columbia Voting Rights Restoration Act of 2004&quot; (H.R. 3709), which would have treated district residents as Maryland residents for congressional representation. Maryland&#x27;s congressional delegation would then be apportioned accordingly to include the district&#x27;s population. Those in favor of such a plan argue that the Congress already has the necessary authority to pass such legislation without the constitutional concerns of other proposed remedies. From the foundation of the District in 1790 until the passage of the Organic Act of 1801, citizens living in the District of Columbia continued to vote for members of Congress in Maryland or Virginia; legal scholars, therefore, propose that the Congress has the power to restore those voting rights while maintaining the integrity of the federal district. However, the proposed legislation never made it out of committee and would not grant the district any additional authority over its local affairs.

=== Voting rights reforms ===

Several bills have been introduced in Congress to grant the District of Columbia voting representation in one or both houses of Congress. The primary issue with all legislative proposals is whether Congress has the constitutional authority to grant the district voting representation. Members of Congress in support of the bills claim that constitutional concerns should not prohibit the legislation&#x27;s passage but should be left to the courts. A secondary criticism of a legislative remedy is that any law granting representation to the district could be undone in the future. Additionally, recent legislative proposals deal with granting representation in the House of Representatives only, which would still leave the issue of Senate representation for District residents unresolved. Since the D.C. Voting Rights Amendment was proposed in 1978, no bill granting the district voting representation has successfully passed both houses of Congress, though the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 did pass in the Senate in 2009. If a bill were to pass, the law would not grant the district any additional authority over its local affairs.

== Political support and opposition ==

=== Civil rights, religious, labor, business, and civic organizations ===
Religious groups supporting D.C. statehood include the American Jewish Committee, the Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism, United Church of Christ, United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society, the Catholic Social Justice Lobby, and the Unitarian Universalist Association. On June 22, 2021, statehood was endorsed by over 300 religious leaders, including James Winkler, head of the National Council of Churches.

According to the Commission for Statehood, an office of the Government of the District of Columbia, D.C. statehood is supported by American University, Georgetown University, the League of Women Voters, the National Bar Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the AFL–CIO, the American Federation of Teachers, the Human Rights Campaign, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Education Association, the National Treasury Employees Union, the National Urban League, SEIU, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and many others.

A July 22, 2021 letter to President Biden calling for support of voting rights and DC statehood prepared by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights was signed by 150 organizations including the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, Common Cause, the National Association of Social Workers, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Organization for Women, and the Communications Workers of America.

In March 2021, the Federal City Council, a consortium of Washington business and civic leaders that promotes economic development in the District of Columbia, launched a research organization, Statehood Research DC, to provide the historical, economic, and legal details of making the District of Columbia a state.

=== District of Columbia political parties ===

Statehood is supported by the D.C. Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party of the District of Columbia, and the D.C. Statehood Green Party. The D.C. Republican Party platform says &quot;The District of Columbia must either become a state or its residents must be exempt from federal income taxes.&quot;

=== Democrats ===
Democratic presidents and presidential nominees since Bill Clinton have supported statehood, including former President Barack Obama, 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Joe Biden. The Democratic party national platform included support for statehood again starting in 2016, having been previously removed from the platform from 2004 to 2012.

From the 1993 statehood failure through the failure of the 2009 House Voting Rights Act, neither statehood nor retrocession was a legislative priority by either party. In 2014, Maryland&#x27;s senators, both Democrats, co-sponsored a D.C. statehood bill.

In May 2017, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate, which led to the first hearings on the subject in years. In February 2019, the House Democratic leadership put its support behind legislation to grant D.C. statehood. Bill H.R. 1, which included a nonbinding expression of support, passed 234 to 193 in March 2019. In 2020 and 2021, the full House of Representatives voted on statehood bills, both approved on party-line votes with Democrats in support and Republicans in opposition.

On April 30, 2021, Democratic senator Joe Manchin came out against both H.R. 51 and S. 51, effectively dooming their passage.

=== Republicans ===

The national Republican Party opposes statehood and believes a constitutional amendment would be required for the district to become a state. The 2016 Republican party platform stated: &quot;Statehood for the District can be advanced only by a constitutional amendment. Any other approach would be invalid.&quot;

Congressional Republicans have strongly opposed statehood bills that attempt to make the district a state without amending the Constitution first, characterizing congressional Democrats&#x27; attempts to pass statehood through as legislation as an &quot;unconstitutional power grab to gain two progressive Senate seats&quot;. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has called D.C. statehood &quot;full bore socialism&quot; and promised to object to any statehood push in the Senate.

The D.C. Republican Party platform says, &quot;The District of Columbia must either become a state or its residents must be exempt from federal income taxes.&quot;

<doc id="519148" wikidata="Q2256160" url="?curid=519148" title="Television in the United States">
<text>Television is one of the major mass media outlets in the United States. In 2011, 96.7% of households owned television sets; about 114,200,000 American households owned at least one television set each in August 2013. Most households have more than one set. The percentage of households owning at least one television set peaked at 98.4%, in the 1996–1997 season. In 1948, 1 percent of U.S. households owned at least one television; in 1955, 75 percent did. In 1992, 60 percent of all U.S. households had cable television subscriptions. However, this number has fallen to 40% in 2024.

As a whole, the television networks that broadcast in the United States are the largest and most distributed in the world, and programs produced specifically for American networks are the most widely syndicated internationally. Because of a surge in the number and popularity of critically acclaimed television series in the 2000s and the 2010s, many critics have said that American television has entered a modern golden age; whether that golden age has ended or is ongoing in the early 2020s is disputed.

==Television channels and networks==
In the United States, television is available via broadcast (also known as &quot;over-the-air&quot; or OTA) – the earliest method of receiving television programming, which merely requires an antenna and an equipped internal or external tuner capable of picking up channels that transmit on the two principal broadcast bands, very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF), to receive the signal – and four conventional types of multichannel subscription television: cable, unencrypted satellite (&quot;free-to-air&quot;), direct-broadcast satellite television and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). There are also competing video services on the World Wide Web, which have become an increasingly popular mode of television viewing since the late 2000s, particularly with younger audiences as an alternative or a supplement to the aforementioned traditional forms of viewing television content; the 2010s saw the development of several virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) services offering &quot;skinny&quot; tiers of channels originally developed for cable and satellite distribution at a reduced base price compared to providers using the more established pay television distribution methods.

Individual broadcast television stations in the U.S. transmit on either VHF channels 2 through 13 or UHF channels 14 through 36. During the era of analog television, broadcast stations transmitted on a single universal channel; however due to the technical complexities of the present digital television standard, most stations now transmit physically on an RF channel that is mapped to a virtual channel, which – with some exceptions – typically differs from their physical allocation and corresponds to the station&#x27;s former analog channel. The UHF band originally spanned from channels 14 to 83, though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has reduced the bandwidth allocation for UHF three times since then. Channels 70 to 83 were cut for emergency and other telecommunications purposes in 1983. In 2009, channels 52 to 69 were removed by mandate at the completion of the transition from analog to digital television. In 2020, transition away from channels above 36 was completed to make room for its use by telecommunications companies, after a 2017 spectrum auction.

As in other countries, television stations require a license to broadcast legally (which any prospective broadcaster can apply for through the FCC) and must comply with certain requirements (such as those involving programming of public affairs and educational interest, and regulations prohibiting the airing of indecent content) to retain it; the FCC&#x27;s Board of Commissioners maintains oversight of the renewal of existing station licenses approaching their expiration, with individuals or groups who wish to oppose the granting of a renewal to a licensee based on any disagreement over rule compliance or any other issues inclined to contest it for consideration of revocation. Free-to-air and subscription television networks, however, are not required to file for a license to operate.

Over-the-air and free-to-air television do not necessitate any monthly payments, while cable, direct broadcast satellite (DBS), IPTV and virtual MVPD services require monthly payments that vary depending on the number of channels that a subscriber chooses to pay for in a particular package. Channels are usually sold in groups (known as &quot;tiers&quot;), rather than singularly (or on an a la carte basis). Most conventional subscription television services offer a limited basic (or &quot;lifeline&quot;) tier, a minimum base package that includes only broadcast stations within the television market where the service is located, and public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable channels; in many smaller markets, this tier may offer stations from adjacent markets that act as default network affiliates for areas not served by a local affiliate of one or more of the major broadcast networks; however, since the digital television transition in the late 2000s, these have been replaced in some cases by digital subchannels that have agreed to provide a particular network&#x27;s programming within the local market.

Elevated programming tiers commonly start with an expanded basic package, offering a selection of subscription channels intended for wide distribution (primarily those that launched between the 1970s and the 1990s); since the upspring of digital cable and satellite television during the mid- and late 1990s, additional channels with more limited distribution are offered as add-ons to the basic packages through separate tiers, which are commonly organized based on the programming format of the channels sold in the tier. A la carte subscription services in the US are primarily limited to pay television (more commonly known as &quot;premium&quot;) channels that are offered as add-ons to any programming package that a customer of a multichannel video programming distributor (also known as a cable or satellite &quot;system&quot; or &quot;provider&quot;) can subscribe to for an additional monthly fee.

===Broadcast television===
The United States has a &quot;decentralized&quot;, market-oriented television system, particularly in regard to broadcast television. The nation has a national public television service known as the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Local media markets have their own television stations, which may either be affiliated with or owned and operated by a television network. Stations may sign affiliation agreements with one of the national networks for the local rights to carry their programming; these contracts can last anywhere from one to ten years, although such agreements often last on average between four and six years. Except in very small markets with a limited number of commercial stations (generally, fewer than five), affiliation agreements are usually exclusive: for example, if a station is affiliated with NBC, it consequently would not air programs from ABC, CBS or other conventional broadcast networks but may carry specialty services intended to be carried on digital television signals on one or more subchannels.
Arrangements in which television stations carried more than one network on its main signal (which often resulted in some network programs being not being cleared to air locally by the station, thereby limiting their national carriage and resulting in viewers having to rely on an out-of-market station receivable in their area that airs the locally pre-empted show through an affiliation with that same network to see it) were more common between the 1940s and the 1960s, although some arrangements continued as late as 2010. Today, programming from networks other than that with which the station maintains a primary affiliation are usually carried over digital subchannels, which increasingly since the mid-2000s, have allowed one of the major broadcast networks to expand their national coverage to markets where they would have previously either had to settle for a secondary affiliation with a full-power television station (which maintain transmitting power as high as 1000 kilowatts and outputs a signal extending as far as from the transmitter site), or an exclusive or primary affiliation with a low-power station with more limited signal coverage (which maintain a reduced transmitting power not exceeding 100 kilowatts, with a more limited signal radius covering an area from the transmitter).

However unlike in other countries, to ensure local presences in television broadcasting, federal law restricts the amount of network programming that local stations can run. Until the 1970s and 1980s, local stations supplemented network programming with a sizeable amount of their own locally produced shows, which encompassed a broad content spectrum that included variety, talk, music and sports programming. Today however, many (though not all) stations produce only local news programs, and in some cases, public affairs programs (most commonly, in the form of news and/or political analysis shows); the remainder of their schedules are filled with syndicated programs, or material produced independently and sold to individual stations in each local market.

The method of most commercial stations – those that rely, at least partly, on advertising for revenue – acquiring programs through distributors of syndicated content to fill time not allotted to network and/or local programming differs from other countries worldwide where networks handle the responsibility of programming first-run and syndicated programs, whereas their partner stations are only responsible for the programming of local content. The international programming model is used in the US by some smaller networks and multicast services, which are more cost-effective for their affiliate stations since they require little to no acquired or locally produced programming to fill airtime at the local level.

The federal government has imposed limits on how many stations an individual owner can hold. The earliest limits restricted owners from holding more than five stations across the entire country, and no more than one in any given market. As of 2017, these limits have been relaxed substantially. Since 1999, an ownership group is now legally allowed to own up to two signals in a market (which can amount to many more actual channels through digital transmission); since the early 1990s, some broadcasters have also used a shell company to circumvent certain ownership restrictions by way of a local marketing agreement; groups can cover up to 78% of the United States with their signals under the &quot;UHF discount&quot; (originally passed in 1985 to benefit UHF television stations that, prior to the 2009 digital transition, often had spotty signal quality), which allows broadcasters to count ownership of UHF stations by 50% of the station&#x27;s audience reach. (The &quot;discount&quot; was repealed by the FCC under Chair Tom Wheeler and his Democrat-led board in 2015, but was reinstated by Wheeler&#x27;s successor and former board colleague, Ajit Pai and his fellow Republican commissioners in April 2017.)

All four of the major television networks directly own and operate a number of stations, concentrating mostly on the largest metropolitan areas. The largest ownership group in terms of coverage of the U.S. is the E. W. Scripps Company, whose stations cover 65% of the nation; Scripps primarily operates affiliates of the six major networks, most maintaining full-scale local operations and/or news departments, though its reach greatly expanded in 2021 through its purchase of Ion Media (corporate parent of namesake flagship network Ion Television), whose stations by contrast are entirely centrally operated and do not maintain local programming, which it acquired to have that group&#x27;s stations serve primarily as pass-through outlets for Scripps’ various multicast network properties. Two other ownership groups in particular, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group, do not produce network programming (Sinclair has produced original programs for its stations but not on a full-time network including the four multicast services it distributes to its own stations and those owned by partner companies and other unaffiliated group owners) but each own over 150 stations, each covering over three-eighths of the country. In terms of number of stations, Nexstar and Sinclair run first and second, with third place held by Gray Television, whose 131 stations cover mostly smaller metropolitan areas reaching only 10% of the population.

====Major broadcast networks====
The four major U.S. broadcast television networks are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), CBS (an abbreviation for the Columbia Broadcasting System, its former legal name), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The first and elder three (which are colloquially known as the &quot;Big Three&quot;) began as radio networks: NBC and CBS respectively began operations in 1926 and 1927. ABC was spun off from NBC to Edward J. Noble in 1943 as the Blue Network during FCC inquiries over NBC&#x27;s dominant share of the American radio market, although the ABC television network would not reach viewership and distribution parity with NBC and CBS until the late 1960s. DuMont Television Network (1948–1956) and NTA Film Network (1956–1961) were early attempts at a &quot;fourth network&quot;. Fox, built partly on the remnants of DuMont, is a relative newcomer that began operations in 1986 and expanded its programming through the 1990s. The Paramount Television Network flourished simultaneously with Fox, if less successfully.

All in all, the U.S. broadcasting landscape dramatically evolved towards a conglomeratization of players – an effect also called concentration of media ownership, which describes the narrowing of competition in modern television broadcasting.

Weekday schedules on ABC, CBS, and NBC affiliates tend to be similar, with programming choices sorted by dayparts (Fox does not air network programming outside of prime time other than sports programming that airs on weekends and, on fairly rare occasions, weekdays). Typically, these begin with an early-morning national newscast (such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;America This Morning&quot;), followed by a local morning news program; these are typically followed by a network morning program (such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;), which usually mixes news, weather, lifestyle segments, interviews and music performances.

Network daytime schedules consist of talk shows and soap operas, although one network – CBS – still carries game shows (a handful of other game shows otherwise air in syndication); local newscasts may air at midday timeslots. Syndicated talk shows are shown in the late afternoon, followed by additional local newscasts in the early evening time period. ABC, CBS and NBC offer network news programs each evening, generally airing at 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone (5:30 or 6:00 p.m. in other areas), however these are sometimes subject to pre-emption on weekends and select holidays due to sports programming that overlaps into the time slot, either because the event is scheduled to occur later in the day or extends beyond the set time block. (At the insistence of sports leagues, most televised sporting events are required to be broadcast until their completion. This is partly in reaction to the infamous 1968 &quot;Heidi Bowl&quot; telecast in which NBC interrupted a National Football League (NFL) game between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders to air a made-for-television film in its scheduled time slot due to a failure in communications between network executives.)

Local newscasts or syndicated programs fill the &quot;prime access&quot; hour or half-hour (7:00 to 8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. in other areas), and lead into the networks&#x27; prime time schedules, which are the day&#x27;s most-watched three hours of television. The traditional prime time schedule runs from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones and 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. elsewhere, although this varies depending on the network and the day: the four major networks program an additional hour (running from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. elsewhere) on Sunday evenings (many Spanish language broadcast networks also program this additional hour to begin their prime time lineups on all seven nights of the week); Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV, in contrast, do not carry any programming during the 10:00/9:00 p.m. hour and leave that hour for their affiliates to provide programming of their own.

Typically, family-oriented comedy programs led in the early part of prime time, although in recent years, reality television programs (such as &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot;), and more adult-oriented scripted programs – both comedies and dramas – have largely replaced them. Later in the evening, drama series of various types (such as &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;) air. Sunday is the most-watched night on American television, with many of TV&#x27;s most popular shows airing on that night. Viewership tends to then decline throughout the week, culminating in the lowest ratings being registered on Friday and Saturday night; most broadcast networks abandoned the programming of first-run scripted fare on Saturdays by 2004, in favor of sports, newsmagazines and burn-offs and reruns of other prime time series; however first-run scripted programming continues to air on Fridays, being mixed in with newsmagazines and/or reality series, depending on the network. Networks, however, pay special attention to Thursday night, which is the last night for advertisers of weekend purchases – such as cars, movie tickets and home video rentals – to reach large television audiences. Throughout the 1990s, NBC called its own Thursday night lineup &quot;Must See TV&quot;, and during that decade, some of the country&#x27;s most watched television shows aired on Thursday nights (several of which aired on NBC), before the re-emergence of Sunday as the top night of prime time programming in the 2000s.

At the end of prime time, another local news program is broadcast, usually followed by late-night interview shows (such as &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; or &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;). Rather than sign off in the early pre-dawn hours of the morning (as was standard practice until the early 1970s in larger markets and until the mid-1980s in smaller ones), television stations now fill the time with syndicated programming, reruns of prime time television shows or late local newscasts (the latter becoming less common since the early 2000s), or 30-minute advertisements, known as infomercials, and in the case of CBS and ABC, overnight network news programs. On some stations, syndicated programming may fill timeslots where local newscasts would traditionally air, either due to the station not programming news in certain time periods or because it does not operate a news department; similarly, local news programs in the late evening hours may air during the final hour of prime time (10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones and 9:00 p.m. in all others) and/or during the morning commute period (7:00 to 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. in all time zones), usually on stations affiliated with networks other than those classified as part of the &quot;Big Three&quot; (ABC, NBC and CBS) and those without a network affiliation.

Saturday mornings usually feature network programming aimed at children (traditionally these mainly consisted of animated cartoons and in some cases, live-action scripted series and even game shows targeted at the demographic, although live-action lifestyle, science and wildlife programs have become the norm for the timeslot since 2009, while animated series have primarily been relegated to non-commercial and non-English language networks), while Sunday mornings include a form of public affairs program known as the Sunday morning talk shows (which maintain a &quot;week-in-review&quot; format that focuses primarily on political and socioeconomic issues, and if a particular program&#x27;s format is more fluid in regards to topical content, other news stories of major interest). Both of these help fulfill stations&#x27; legal obligations, respectively to provide educational children&#x27;s programs (through a law passed in 1990 known as the Children&#x27;s Television Act, which requires stations to carry a minimum of three hours of programs featuring content benefiting the educational needs of youth each week) and public service programming. Sports and infomercials (and on some stations, syndicated feature film packages) can be found on weekend afternoons, followed again by the same type of prime-time shows aired during the week.

====Other over-the-air commercial television====

From 1956 to 1986, the majority of English-language television stations that were not affiliated with the Big Three networks, nor affiliates of National Educational Television nor, arguably, (from 1956 to 1961) the smaller NTA Film Network were &quot;independent,&quot; airing only syndicated and some locally produced programming to fill their daily schedules. Many independent stations still exist in the U.S., usually historically broadcasting on the UHF band; however the number of them had drastically decreased (especially within individual markets) after 1995 due to the formation of newer broadcast networks that were created to compete against the four established competitors. Syndicated shows, often reruns of television series currently in or out of production and movies released as recently as three years prior to their initial syndication broadcast, take up much of their schedules.

However, in October 1986, the Fox Broadcasting Company was launched as a challenge to the Big Three networks, with six independent stations that News Corporation (which acquired the 20th Century Fox the year before) had acquired from Metromedia as its cornerstone charter outlets, along with many independents owned by other companies. Thanks largely to the success of shows like &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;, as well as the network&#x27;s acquisition of rights to show games from the National Football League&#x27;s National Football Conference arm in December 1993, Fox has established itself as a major player in broadcast television. However, Fox differs from the three older networks in that it does not air daily morning and nightly news programs or have network-run daytime or weeknight late night schedules (though the network made previous failed attempts at late night programming on Monday through Friday evenings between 1986 and 1993; Fox ceased original late night programming in favor of reruns in 2016). Its nightly prime-time schedule runs only two hours long on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays (something the network intentionally did to sidestep FCC regulations for television networks in effect at Fox&#x27;s launch), and some of its major market affiliates used to broadcast on UHF before the digital transition (several affiliates though broadcast on VHF pre-transition, primarily as a result of affiliation deals with former longtime Big Three affiliates owned by now-defunct station groups New World Communications and SF Broadcasting that it signed after acquiring the NFL rights).

Many of its affiliates in mid-size and small markets outsource news production to Big Three affiliates rather produce their own newscasts, and its flagship stations in New York City and Los Angeles do not include the network&#x27;s name within their callsigns (Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations in New York City and Los Angeles instead use the respective callsigns WNYW and KTTV; the WFOX-TV and KFOX-TV calls are respectively used by Fox affiliates in Jacksonville, Florida and El Paso, Texas). Fox&#x27;s only scheduled news program is &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, which it airs on Sunday mornings; special news coverage on the network comes from the staff of its sister cable network Fox News (which launched in October 1996, around the same time as its affiliate video service Fox NewsEdge), though not every affiliate carries breaking news bulletins from Fox News outside of prime time presidential addresses, and national and international events of utmost urgency. Most of Fox&#x27;s affiliates now have local newscasts (only a small number of affiliates, mainly based in larger markets, carried news programming prior to the mid-1990s), often scheduled during the final hour of prime time – an hour earlier than newscasts seen on major network stations – at which time they compete with network dramas, rather than other local newscasts (although some news-producing Fox stations also carry newscasts in the traditional late news time period), and for one to three additional hours in the morning that overlap with morning news programs on ABC, NBC and CBS.

Three new networks launched in the 1990s: within six days of each other in January 1995, The WB Television Network (which was originally formed as a venture between Time Warner, Tribune Broadcasting – which made the majority of its independent stations principal charter affiliates of the network – and former Fox executive Jamie Kellner, who served as The WB&#x27;s original chief executive officer) and the United Paramount Network (UPN; created as a programming partnership between Chris-Craft Industries/United Television and Paramount Television, which had been acquired the year prior by Viacom, which would gain full ownership of UPN five years after the network&#x27;s launch) were launched primarily to compete against Fox, targeting the same younger demographic (teenagers and young adults 12 to 34) that network had built its success upon during the first half of the decade. In August 1998, Paxson Communications (later Ion Media prior to being bought by Scripps in 2021) launched Pax TV to counterprogram the four larger networks as well as The WB and UPN, with a focus on family-oriented original and acquired programming; due to underperforming viewership in its initial format, Pax relaunched as i: Independent Television (focusing more on reruns and movies aimed at a broader audience) in July 2005 and then as Ion Television in September 2007.

The CW Television Network was created on September 18, 2006 when CBS Corporation and Time Warner decided to merge UPN and The WB, with The CW also drawing from the latter&#x27;s broadcast and cable assets and scheduling model (The WB&#x27;s online assets remained separate, although its former web domain – which was revamped as a streaming service – was shut down in December 2013 and replaced with a promotional website for Warner Bros. Television programs). The CW broadcasts fourteen hours a week of programming in prime time, all airing on Monday through Sundays (the network maintained a three-hour evening lineup on Sundays from 2006 to 2009, when that time was turned over to its affiliates; it reinstated Sunday prime time programming in October 2018), and three hours on Saturday mornings (its children&#x27;s program block may bleed into the afternoon hours on weekends on a few stations due to other locally scheduled programs). The CW is the only major broadcast network that operates a national programming service feed for smaller markets, The CW Plus (a successor to The WB&#x27;s group of cable-only affiliates, The WB 100+ Station Group, which launched in September 1998 to provide the network&#x27;s programming to markets where it would otherwise not be able to gain adequate over-the-air coverage), which, as a cost-effective method that reduces programming responsibilities on prospective affiliate stations, fills airtime not occupied by CW network programming with syndicated programs and infomercials; The CW Plus is distributed via digital subchannel and cable-only affiliates, making it also one of the only networks that has local affiliates that do not broadcast over-the-air.

MyNetworkTV originally started as a major network with a format primarily consisting of English language telenovelas; however, after experiencing continued low ratings for its prime time-exclusive schedule (even after several programming revamps that followed over the next three years after the initial format faltered), it converted into a &quot;broadcast programming service&quot; in September 2009, adopting a format made up of reruns of series originally aired on other networks for ten hours a week on Mondays through Fridays.

Ion broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week (though only eighteen hours of its schedule each day consist of entertainment programming, with infomercials and religious programming making up the remainder of the schedule), making the Ion network the largest English-language commercial television network to be totally responsible for its affiliates&#x27; programming. Ion differs from other commercial networks in that the majority of its stations are owned-and-operated by its parent company with very few affiliates, and it is distributed exclusively via cable and satellite in markets where the network does not have a local station; Ion was the last of the seven conventional English language commercial broadcast networks to expand into distribution via digital multicasting, having relied entirely on cable and satellite distribution in markets where it otherwise could not maintain a primary affiliation until 2014, when it began accepting subchannel-only affiliates through deals with Gray Television and Nexstar Media Group.

====Digital multicast services====
With the digital television transition, which was completed in two phases in February and June 2009, the use of digital multicasting has given breed to various networks created for distribution on these multiplexed feeds of new and existing stations. However, for the most part, very few of these networks have been able to gain a national reach on parity with many of the conventional commercial and non-commercial networks, in part due to the fact that many stations transmit high definition programming on their main feed in 1080i, which requires a bitrate less compartmentalized for allowing more than one multicast feed (which are generally transmitted in standard definition) without risking diminished picture quality; some alternately transmit their main feed in 720p, which favors multiplexing of more than two subchannels at a time (ATSC 3.0, which began development around the time of the 2009 transition with FCC consideration to replace the current ATSC 1.0 as the technological standard for digital television expected to occur in 2016, uses improved compression technology able to fit additional subchannels on a single programming stream as well as allowing for the transmission of high definition content in the 4K resolution format).

Retro Television Network was among the first networks to be produced specifically for the digital television market; Equity Broadcasting created the network in 2005, originally relying mostly on public domain series before expanding to a broader library of licensed reruns. RTN&#x27;s initial success was dented by its owner&#x27;s financial collapse and further difficulties pertaining to its successor, current owner Get After It Media (Luken Communications). The most popular and widely distributed network that uses digital subchannels as its primary form of distribution is MeTV, a classic television network originally launched by station owner Weigel Broadcasting in 2005 as a programming format on one of its flagship television stations in Chicago, WFBT-CA (now WWME-CD), and evolved into a national network in November 2010; MeTV now has affiliations with primary channels in a number of markets (WJLP in the New York City market, WDPN-TV in Philadelphia and Delaware, and WGTA in Atlanta). Both MeTV and its most prominent rival, Nexstar-owned Antenna TV (originally founded in 2010 by Tribune Broadcasting), popularized the format for multicasting that relies on archived programming. This TV (owned by Allen Media Group, and co-founded by Weigel and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) used a similar format, focusing on older as well as some relatively recent feature films; it helped to spawn similar movie-oriented broadcast networks such as Movies! (a joint venture between Weigel and Fox Television Stations, which relies primarily on films from the library of the latter&#x27;s former sister film studio, 20th Century Studios) and GetTV (which mainly airs films from the library of owner Sony Pictures Entertainment).

Demographically focused networks were created during the 2010s; Bounce TV was launched in September 2011 by Martin Luther King III and Andrew Young, featuring a broader general entertainment format aimed at African American adults. Katz Broadcasting, owned by Bounce executive Jonathan Katz and purchased by the E. W. Scripps Company in 2017, launched two gender-focused networks with specific formats in August 2014 – Grit (aimed at men with a lineup heavy on western and action films) and Escape (now Court TV Mystery, aimed at women and featuring mystery and true crime programs) – and a genre-based network in April 2015, Laff (featuring a mix of comedic feature films and sitcoms). Luken Communications is the largest operator of subchannel networks by total number (which are largely carried on low-power outlets), which in addition to the Retro Television Network include among others country and rural themed Heartland, automotive-centered Rev&#x27;n, children&#x27;s network PBJ and a modern version of The Family Channel. Men&#x27;s network Tuff TV was formerly managed as a Luken network but is now independent.

Other subchannel-based networks include those that also rely on archived programming such as Buzzr (a network focusing of game shows sourced from the programming library of owner Fremantle) and Comet (launched by the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in October 2015, focusing on science fiction series and films sourced from the MGM library), and networks which do not completely if at all rely on archived scripted programming like Court TV (a network developed by Katz/Scripps as a revival of the cable network now known as TruTV, which mainly airs court trial coverage and true crime programming), WeatherNation TV (an independently owned 24-hour weather network which features subchannels as part of its multiplatform distribution model), TheCoolTV and The Country Network (which rely on music videos).

In smaller cities and rural areas, the major broadcast networks may also rely on digital subchannels to be seen in these areas, as the market may not be populous enough to support a financially independent station for each network. As such FCC regulations govern cable providers must provide basic service at a reasonable cost. (Since advent of digital television equipment, the cost is responsibility of the consumer.)

====Broadcast television in languages other than English====
=====Spanish=====

Several Spanish language broadcast (as well as cable) networks exist, which are the most common form of non-English television broadcasts. These networks are not as widely distributed over-the-air as their English counterparts, available mostly in markets with sizeable Latino and Hispanic populations; several of these over-the-air networks are alternatively fed directly to cable, satellite and IPTV providers in markets without either the availability or the demand for a locally based owned-and-operated or affiliate station.

The largest of these networks, Univision, launched in 1986 as a successor to the Spanish International Network (which debuted in September 1962, with Spanish language independent stations KMEX-TV in Los Angeles and KCOR-TV (now KWEX-DT) in San Antonio, Texas as its charter stations). It has risen to become the fifth highest-rated television network in the U.S. (behind NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox) and is the dominant Spanish language network in the U.S., with its ratings having risen to levels where it has beaten at least one of its English language competitors since the late 1990s. Although Univision originally featured programming content from a variety of distributors, the network now relies mainly on programs sourced from Mexico&#x27;s dominant broadcaster, Televisa (which has maintained partial ownership of Univision&#x27;s corporate parent on and off throughout its history) as well as domestically produced programming.

Its major competition is Telemundo, a sister network of NBC (which acquired Telemundo in 2001) that was also established in 1986 through a consortium of three Spanish-language stations, WNJU/New York City, WBBS-TV/Chicago and KVEA/Los Angeles. It was considered an also-ran to Univision until the late 2000s, when parent company NBCUniversal began heavily investing in its news and entertainment programming. Unlike Univision, the majority of Telemundo&#x27;s programming is produced specifically for the network. In addition to carrying the traditional programming format for Spanish language broadcasters (which typically incorporates telenovelas, variety series, news, sports and films imported from Latin American countries), also includes dubbed versions of American feature film releases.

Other popular Spanish-language broadcast networks are Univision-owned UniMás, which was launched in January 2002 and is aimed at a younger Hispanic demographic; Azteca, the American version of Mexico&#x27;s Azteca networks, which debuted in July 2001; TeleXitos aimed at Hispanic and Latino Americans, the network airs a mix of dramatic television series from the 1970s to the 2000s and movies, with all programming consisting of shows dubbed into Spanish; and independent networks Estrella TV (which began as a programming format on Liberman Broadcasting&#x27;s Spanish language independent stations in the early 2000s and eventually launched nationally in September 2009, featuring a traditional lineup of Latino-focused programming largely produced by Liberman) and LATV (which originated in 2002 as a programming format on KJLA in Los Angeles before becoming a national network in September 2007, and focuses mostly on unscripted music, talk and variety programs). V-me (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbeme], a pun on veme, &quot;watch me&quot;) is a Spanish broadcast television network formerly carried in association with public television stations created for the United States Hispanic market, which is currently pursuing a pay-TV model. V-me delivers drama, music, current affairs, food, lifestyle, nature and educational pre-school content to its viewers.

Currently, The Hispanic Information and Telecommunications Network, Inc. (HITN) is the largest Spanish-language broadcasting network in the United States. It delivers educational programming to over 42 million homes nationwide, and reaches over 40% of U.S. households. Its distribution network includes Comcast, DirecTV, Verizon FiOS, Dish Network, Altice USA, U-verse TV, Charter Communications, and a host of smaller distributors. Its stated mission is &quot;to advance the educational, social, cultural, and economic circumstances of Hispanics.&quot;

=====Other languages=====
French language programming is generally limited in scope, with some locally produced French and creole programming available in the Miami area (serving refugees from Haiti) and Louisiana, along with some locales along the heavily populated Eastern Seaboard. Francophone areas near the eastern portion of the Canada–United States border generally receive television broadcasts presented in the language from French Canadian networks (such as Ici Radio-Canada Télé and TVA), which are widely available over-the-air but rarely on cable in those areas.

Many large cities also have television stations that broadcast programming in various Asian languages (such as KTSF in San Francisco), especially after the digital television transition, which has allowed some smaller stations in areas with heavy populations of Asian immigrants and American natives of Asian origin fluent in one of that continent&#x27;s indigenous languages to carry such programming either as primary channel or subchannel affiliations. A few unusual examples of other foreign broadcasters also exist, such as Greek language WZRA-CD in Florida and Polish language WPVN-DT4 in Chicago.

There have also been a few local stations that have broadcast programming in American Sign Language, accompanied by English closed captioning. Prior to the development of closed captioning, it was not uncommon for some public television programs to incorporate ASL translations by an on-screen interpreter. An interpreter may still be used for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community for on-air emergency broadcasts (such as severe weather alerts given by local governments) as well as televised press conferences by local and state government officials accompanied by closed captioning.

====Non-commercial television====
Public television has a far smaller role in the United States than in most other countries. The federal government, through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), does operate NASA TV (a service focusing on the U.S. space program with some educational programming) for public consumption, but only distributes that service via satellite and the Internet and not through terrestrial outlets; the United States Department of Defense produced the Pentagon Channel (later renamed DoD News Channel), a military news outlet that operated from 2004 to 2015. In addition, Broadcasting Board of Governors content (the most well-known being Voice of America) has been available to U.S. consumers since the partial repeal of the Smith–Mundt Act in 2013; VOA and its sister outlets are likewise restricted to shortwave and Internet broadcasts. Content from the National Weather Service (such as loops of NEXRAD imagery and NOAA Weather Radio feeds) is frequently repurposed for television.

The Public Broadcasting Service is the largest public television broadcaster in the United States, originating in October 1970 as the successor of National Educational Television (which was established in 1954). Unlike the commercial networks, PBS does not officially produce any of its own programming; instead, individual PBS stations (most notably, WNET in Newark, New Jersey/New York City, WGBH-TV in Boston and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C.), station groups and affiliated producers create programming and provide these through PBS to other affiliates. While it does provide a base slate of programming to its member stations (which is limited to roughly thirteen hours a week of programming in prime time, airing on Sunday through Fridays with fewer programs on Thursday and Friday evenings, as well as daytime children&#x27;s programming during the morning and afternoon), PBS does not schedule all programs it supplies in set time slots, giving its members leeway in scheduling these programs in time slots of their choosing. Like the six larger commercial English language broadcast networks, its member stations handle the responsibility of programming time periods where programming supplied by the service is not broadcast, which are filled by cultural and public affairs programming of relevance to their market or region of service, and syndicated programs of various genres.

Most (but, by no means, all) public television stations are members of PBS, sharing programs such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;NOVA&quot; and &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. Although many PBS stations operate individually, a number of states – such as Wisconsin, Maryland, Minnesota, Oklahoma and South Carolina – have state-owned public broadcasting authorities that operate and fund all public television stations in their respective states. The Alabama Educational Television Commission, licensee for the nine stations comprising Alabama Public Television, was established by the Alabama Legislature in 1953. In January 1955, WCIQ on Mount Cheaha began operation as the nation&#x27;s ninth non-commercial television station. Four months later in April 1955 with the sign-on of WBIQ in Birmingham, Alabama became the first state in the country with an educational television network. Alabama Public Television was a model for other states in the nation and for television broadcasters in other countries. 25 other states copied Alabama&#x27;s system of operation to provide service through multiple, linked television stations, using full-power satellite stations and (in some cases) low-power translators to relay the originating station&#x27;s programming to other areas. Similar state networks have also been created by commercial broadcasters to relay network programming throughout portions or even the entirety of a state.

The federal government does subsidize non-commercial educational television stations through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The income received from the government is insufficient to cover expenses and stations rely on corporate sponsorships and viewer contributions (including from private benefactors) to finance their operations and programming production. Various public television outlets – albeit not on all individual PBS member and independent public broadcasting stations and PBS member networks simultaneously – hold pledge drives two to four times per year, which account for a decent portion of the non-government-subsidized income through public and private contributions.

American public television stations air programming that commercial stations do not offer, such as educational (including cultural and arts) and public affairs programming. There are also a number of syndicators dealing exclusively or primarily with public broadcast stations, both PBS and independent public television stations (most prominently, American Public Television). Additionally, there are a number of smaller networks feeding programming to public stations – including World, First Nations Experience (focusing on Native American and indigenous programing), and Create (focusing on lifestyle, travel, cooking and how-to programs) – primarily through digital multicasting; the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle has also provided blocks of programming to a variety of affiliates in the U.S., and increasingly feeds from other national broadcasters (including Deutsche Welle&#x27;s DW-TV) have been distributed through digital subchannels belonging to public stations in the U.S. New York City&#x27;s municipally-owned broadcast service, NYC Media, creates original programming that airs in several markets. Few cities have major municipally-owned stations.

Many religious broadcast networks and stations exist, also surviving on viewer contributions and time leased to the programming producers; the two most prominent are the Trinity Broadcasting Network, which was founded in 1973 by Paul and Jan Crouch as a part-time ministry that leased programming time on KBSA (now UniMás owned-and-operated station KFTR-DT) in the Los Angeles exurb of Ontario, California, before moving to KLXA-TV (now KTBN-TV) in Fontana, which it began purchasing time on in the following year after KBSA was sold; it gradually became the most widely distributed Christian television network in the world with 20 networks (including five in the United States that are primarily available through multicasting, The Church Channel, the youth-oriented JUCE TV and Smile of a Child TV, and the Latino-oriented TBN Enlace USA and TBN Salsa) and several affiliates internationally; and the Daystar Television Network, founded in 1993 by Marcus and Joni Lamb, when the former&#x27;s Word of God Fellowship ministry purchased the license of defunct UHF station KMPX (now an Estrella TV owned-and-operated station) in Dallas, Texas. Most of their stations are owned by the television ministries directly or through subsidiary companies (Community Educational Television and Word of God Fellowship, respectively) used by them to operate stations that TBN and Daystar cannot own outright due to FCC regulations prohibiting individual broadcasting companies from owning television stations reaching more than 39% of all U.S. television markets.

Other Christian broadcasters include the Three Angels Broadcasting Network (associated with the Seventh-day Adventists), Cornerstone Television, World Harvest Television (WHT), Hope Channel, Amazing Facts Television, The Word Network, The Worship Network and Total Christian Television. These networks rely mainly on overt televangelism from church services or other religious teaching series for programming, although they also incorporate faith-based children&#x27;s programming and also air religious-themed feature-length films. Other religions outside of evangelical Christianity also have television outlets, including the predominantly Roman Catholic-oriented Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), Jewish Life Television (JLTV), and the LDS-affiliated Brigham Young University Television (byuTV). Several predominantly religious broadcasters carry some secular, usually family-friendly, programming in addition to the overt televangelism; byuTV runs family comedies, WHT runs classic Westerns, the Christian Television Network and Total Living Network operate &quot;lifestyle&quot; channels with secular home, garden and human interest programming, and JLTV runs classic comedy reruns from Jewish entertainers.

Spanish-language religious networks ESNE (Roman Catholic), Almavision (Christian), Vision Latina (Iglesia Universal), Esperanza TV, 3ABN Latino, and Enlace (Christian) provide religious programming to the Spanish-speaking viewers across the United States with sermons, discussions and music.

Public access television is a noncommercial form of television required by law to be offered to cable television consumers, in which members of the public are free to place their programming on the cable service. It is a subset of public, educational and government access. Most popular in the 1980s and early 1990s, the rise of the Internet and subscription satellite television (the latter of which is not required to carry public-access television services) has forced it to evolve.

===Cable and satellite television===
While pay television systems existed as early as the late 1940s, until the early 1970s, cable television only served to distribute distant over-the-air television stations to rural areas not served by stations that are based locally. This role was reflected in the original meaning of the CATV acronym, &quot;community antenna TV&quot;. In that decade, national networks that exclusively transmitted via cable and maintained their own individual programming formats began to launch, while cable system franchises began operating in major cities with over-the-air television stations. By the mid-1970s, some form of cable television was available in almost every market that already had over-the-air television service. Today, most American households receive cable television, and cable networks collectively have greater viewership than broadcast networks, even though individual programs on most of the major commercial broadcast networks often have relatively higher viewership than those seen on cable channels.
The oldest-existing cable-originated television channel as well as the first successful premium cable (or &quot;pay-cable&quot;) service is Home Box Office (HBO), which was also the first television network intended for cable distribution on a regional or national basis. HBO launched on November 8, 1972, to 365 Service Electric Cable subscribers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, with a mix of movies, sports, and comedy and music specials. For its first three years of operation, it used microwave technology to transmit its programming to CATV and MMDS providers in Pennsylvania and New York. On September 30, 1975, beginning with its telecast of the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, HBO became the first television network to use communications satellites to transmit its programming, immediately expanding its distribution to UA Columbia Cablevision&#x27;s Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, Florida, systems and the American Television and Communications Corporation system in Jackson, Mississippi.

The first basic cable network was Atlanta, Georgia independent station WTCG (channel 17), which was uplinked to satellite on December 17, 1976, months after station owner Ted Turner reached an agreement with media executive Howard H. Hubbard to set up a cable network via satellite transmission. Turner&#x27;s decision to distribute his station – which subsequently had its call sign changed to WTBS (for &quot;Turner Broadcasting System&quot;) – via satellite enabled WTCG to be received nationwide, especially in markets that did not have a local independent station or did not receive an out-of-market independent. In 1981, Turner Broadcasting split the Atlanta broadcast feed of WTBS from the satellite-delivered cable feed and began marketing the channel to cable providers as a &quot;free market superstation&quot;. (The broadcast and cable feeds, however, simulcast one another with certain exceptions until October 2007, when Turner Broadcasting – which was acquired by Time Warner in 1996 – decided to separate the programming on both feeds, therefore making TBS a cable-exclusive entertainment network with a principal focus on comedy, and reformatting the Atlanta signal under the WPCH-TV call letters).

Turner&#x27;s move pioneered the superstation concept, which precipitated other independent stations – most notably, WGN-TV in Chicago and WOR-TV (now MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV) in New York City – to uplink their signals to satellite for redistribution by cable systems outside the station&#x27;s primary coverage area. (The practice has since been restricted by the FCC, although six stations that achieved superstation coverage prior to the ban [including WPCH] maintain grandfather clauses to continue offering their programming throughout the United States and Canada.) Other national superstations followed WTBS&#x27;s lead in implementing a separate national feed that incorporated substitute programming for shows seen in the originating market that local stations declared themselves to be the exclusive carriers in their market after syndication exclusivity regulations went into effect in January 1990. Since WGN America (the former national feed of WGN-TV, which began converting into a news channel as NewsNation in March 2021) converted into a conventional cable channel in 2014, no national superstations exist in the United States and the six remaining regional superstations are limited to distribution via Dish Network and C-band satellite as well as through limited distribution on cable providers in their associated regions of the U.S.

The second basic cable network, the first to operate as a cable-originated outlet and the first such network to be uplinked via satellite from launch was the CBN Satellite Network, launched in April 1977 by televangelist Pat Robertson as the television ministry of his Christian Broadcasting Network. By the time it reformatted as the CBN Cable Network in 1981, it refocused towards secular family-oriented programming, carrying a mix of reruns of classic television series and feature films alongside its religious programming. The network changed its name to The CBN Family Channel in 1988 (revised to The Family Channel in 1990, after CBN spun it off into the indirectly related International Family Entertainment), focusing more on family entertainment programs and reducing reliance on religious programs; this shift towards an entertainment format was more pronounced in its subsequent formats as Fox Family (following its 1998 purchase by News Corporation), ABC Family (after its 2001 sale to ABC parent The Walt Disney Company) and Freeform (to which it was renamed in January 2016 to signify its shift toward a broad schedule of family-oriented shows as well as series of appeal to teen and young adult audiences).
Unlike broadcast networks, most cable networks air the same programming nationwide. Top cable networks include USA Network (which maintains a general entertainment format), ESPN and FS1 (which focus on sports programming), MTV (which originally focused on music videos when it launched in April 1981, but now largely features music-related, original scripted and reality television programming), CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel (which are dedicated news channels with some opinion and other feature-driven programming), A&amp;E (a network created through the 1984 merger of arts-and-culture-oriented channels ARTS and The Entertainment Channel, which now focuses on non-fiction programs and reality docuseries), Syfy (which focuses on science fiction and fantasy programming), Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network (which focus on children&#x27;s programming, although the latter two run nighttime blocks aimed at a teen and adult audience, Nick at Nite and Adult Swim), Discovery Channel and Animal Planet (which focus on reality and documentary programs), AMC (which originally began as a classic film-focused movie channel in October 1984, and now focuses on a mix of feature films and original series), Turner Classic Movies (which focuses on older theatrical feature films), E! (which originally focused on the entertainment industry, but now largely focuses on pop culture shows, films and reality series), Bravo (which began in 1982 as a premium channel focusing on international films and arts programming, but now focuses mostly on reality series and mainstream films), TNT and FX (also general entertainment networks, with some focus on drama) and Lifetime (which targets at a female audience, with a mix of television films, and original and acquired comedy, reality and drama series).
Premium channels – cable networks that subscribers have to pay an additional fee to their provider to receive – began launching in the 1970s and initially grew in popularity as it allowed subscribers to watch movies without time or content editing common with over-the-air television broadcasts of theatrically released feature films and without interruptions by advertising. While HBO continues to feature theatrical films and specials, the service eventually became one of the first cable channels to successfully venture into original programming; by the late 1990s, HBO began to be known for groundbreaking first-run series (such as &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City&quot;) that were edgier and more risque in content than those allowed to air on broadcast networks. Other pay-extra networks launched in the years subsequent to HBO&#x27;s launch including Showtime, which launched on September 16, 1976, with a similar format; and movie-oriented services such as Star Channel (which launched in April 1973, and later became The Movie Channel in November 1979) and HBO-owned Cinemax (which launched on August 1, 1980, and later became more known for its late-night softcore pornographic films). Although attempts at such services date back to the 1950s, pay-per-view services (such as Viewer&#x27;s Choice and Request TV) began launching in the mid-1980s, allowing subscribers to purchase movies and events on a one-time-only basis via telephone; with the advent of digital cable, interactive technologies allowed pay-per-view selections to be purchased by remote.

In addition to sports networks that are distributed to a national audience, two other types of sports-oriented television networks exist. Regional sports networks are cable outlets designed to cover a limited geographic region and metropolitan area, which carry events from local professional and collegiate sports teams, as well as team-related programs, news and magazine programs. The most prominent of these are Bally Sports, NBC Sports Regional Networks, AT&amp;T SportsNet and Spectrum Sports, which comprise multiple networks serving different regions of the United States. Independently owned regional sports networks also exist in some regions served by one of the major groups. Out-of-market sports packages, meanwhile, are composed of individual multichannel packages broadcasting events from an individual sport that are carried by regional sports networks, and national and local broadcasters that hold rights to individual teams or sports leagues; the out-of-market sports package is the most expensive form of a la carte television service, ranging in price from $50 to $75 per month.

====Transmission and technology====

The national cable television network became possible in the mid-1970s with the launch of domestic communications satellites that could economically broadcast television programs to cable operators anywhere in the continental United States (some domestic satellites also covered Alaska and Hawaii with dedicated spot beams). Until then, cable networks like HBO had been limited to regional coverage through distribution over expensive terrestrial microwave links leased from the telephone companies (primarily AT&amp;T). Satellites were generally used only for international (i.e., transoceanic) communications; their antennas covered an entire hemisphere, producing weak signals that required large, expensive receiving antennas. The first domestic communications satellite, Westar 1, was launched in 1974. By concentrating its signal on the continental United States with a directional antenna, Westar 1 could transmit to TVRO (&quot;television receive-only&quot;) dishes only a few meters in diameter, well within the means of local cable television operators. HBO became the first cable network to transmit programming via satellite in September 1975.
Cable &quot;system operators&quot; now receive programming by satellite, terrestrial optical fiber (a method used primarily to relay local stations based within metropolitan areas to the franchise, and acts as a backup for the system operator if a broadcast station&#x27;s over-the-air signal is affected by a power outage or other technical malfunction involving the main transmitter), off the air (a method used to relay broadcast stations to cable franchises in outlying areas and satellite providers), and from in-house sources and relay it to subscribers&#x27; homes. Usually, local governments award a monopoly to provide cable television service in a given area. By law, cable systems must include local broadcast stations in their offerings to customers.

Enterprising individuals soon found they could install their own satellite dishes and eavesdrop on the feeds to the cable operators. The signals were transmitted as unscrambled analog FM feeds that did not require advanced or expensive technology. Since these same satellites were also used internally by the television networks, they could also watch programs not intended for public broadcast such as affiliate feeds without commercials and/or intended for another time zone; raw footage from remote news teams; advance transmissions of upcoming programs; and live news and talk shows during breaks when those on camera might not realize that anyone outside the network could hear them.

Encryption was introduced to prevent people from receiving pay content for free, and nearly every pay channel was encrypted by the mid-to-late 1980s. (This did not happen without protest, such as an incident in which a Florida satellite dealer intercepted the signal of HBO during a film telecast in 1986 to transmit a text-based message over color bars objecting to the network&#x27;s decision to encrypt its feed.) Satellite television also began a digital transition, well before over-the-air broadcasting did the same, to increase satellite capacity and/or reduce the size of the receiving antennas; this also made it more difficult for individuals to intercept these signals. Eventually, the industry began to cater to individuals who wanted to continue to receive satellite television (and were willing to pay for it) in two ways: by authorizing the descrambling of the original satellite feeds to the cable television operators, and with new direct broadcast satellite television services using their own satellites. These latter services, which began operating in the mid-1990s, offer programming similar to cable television.

DirecTV and Dish Network are the major DBS providers in the country, with 20 and 14 million customers respectively . Meanwhile, the major cable television providers are Comcast with 22 million customers, Spectrum Cable with 11 million, and Cox Communications, Charter Communications, AT&amp;T U-verse and Verizon FiOS with five to six million each.

Although most networks make viewers pay a fee to receive their programming, some networks broadcast using unencrypted feeds. After broadcast television switched to a digital infrastructure, new channels became available on unencrypted satellites to bring more free television to Americans; some of these are available as a digital subchannel to local broadcasters, this reason may be for the expensive costs of the DVB-S equipment. NASA TV, Pentagon Channel, Antenna TV, This TV, TheCoolTV and the Retro Television Network (through its affiliates) are examples, international news channels like NHK World, France 24, i24news and Al Jazeera English until the launch of Al Jazeera America are commonly watched this way as a result to the lack of availability on cable, DBS and IPTV.

Some cable providers use interactive features built into set-top boxes leased to their subscribers to distribute video on demand services within their internal networks. Many providers of subscription television services – both networks and system operators – also have TV Everywhere services, which usually mix the video on demand model with live streaming capabilities (allowing viewers to watch broadcasts from over-the-air networks and stations, and cable channels in near real-time), but require password and username authentication through participating pay television providers.

===Internet services===

Streaming television is similar to a cable subscription model, but instead of the set-top box receiving information via a dedicated wire, video is transmitted over the public Internet or private Internet Protocol-based network to a set-top box or in some cases directly to an enabled television.

OTT, or Over-the-top content bypasses multiple system operators entirely, and allows viewing of programs hosted by independent providers. Internet television, also known as web television, began in the 1990s and has become popular in the 2000s onward, resulting in a trend of cord-cutting – the canceling of cable subscriptions in favor of online content that consumers supplement with either over-the-air broadcasts, DVD rentals or a combination of all three viewing methods.

Web television providers in the U.S. include Netflix (which was originally structured as a mail-order DVD rental service), Hulu, MyTV, and many international websites such as YouTube, Myspace, Newgrounds, and Crackle. In addition, services like Vudu, Apple TV+, and Amazon Prime Video are digital services that you can buy a movie or a collection of movies and shows for payment or rent. Streaming services such as Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock allow people to watch all the shows and movies in their catalog for a price every month or year. Viewers can watch these programs from any web browser, whether on a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or a Smart TV. Mobile television services also include mobile apps for both traditional and new programming providers, usually optimized for a small screen and mobile bandwidth constraints. Mobile video is available for direct download or streaming (usually for a one-time download fee) from the iTunes Store, Google Play and Amazon Prime Video.

Internet-connected video game consoles and dedicated Smart TV boxes are available that connect televisions to Internet television and/or online video services. These devices are marketed as more convenient for consumers who would otherwise have trouble connecting a computer to a full-size television and using a web browser to view content. Some televisions have built-in capabilities; dedicated boxes include Android TV, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Netgear Digital Entertainer, Amkette EvoTV and formerly the Nexus Q and Google TV. Devices that require a PC and television include Windows Media Center Extender, HP MediaSmart Connect, Boxee and Hauppauge MediaMVP.

Aereo provided a cloud-based digital video recorder service for over-the-air broadcasts, which it also streamed; although it and the similarly structured FilmOn have run into legal problems with broadcasters who accused the services of transmitting programs from broadcast television stations in violation of copyrights. Although Aereo and FilmOn both stated that their use of &quot;miniature&quot; antennas for transmission of programs to individual users is legal, following mixed decisions by circuit courts that declared them either legal or in infringement of copyrights, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July 2014 that Aereo&#x27;s business model had an &quot;overwhelming likeness to cable companies,&quot; and its transmission of local station signals constituted an unauthorized public performance in violation of copyright rules, forcing Aereo and FilmOn to stop transmitting local stations from several markets. Aereo eventually suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy in November of that year, later choosing to auction off its assets and technology; FilmOn however remains in operation, offering other free-to-air U.S.-based networks in addition to its own exclusive channels, but was found in contempt by New York district court in July 2014 for briefly continuing to stream U.S. stations after the Supreme Court ruling.

Over-the-top subscription services that mirrored cable and TV Everywhere services began emerging in the mid-2010s. In 2015, Dish Network and Sony respectively launched Sling TV and PlayStation Vue, cable-style online and mobile streaming services priced at lower monthly rates than packages offered by traditional pay television system operators. Each include slimmed down tiers of cable and satellite-originated networks from a relatively limited number of network owners. Sling TV, in an effort to cap programming costs, does not include local broadcast stations or regional sports networks; conversely, PlayStation Vue does carry ABC-, NBC-, CBS- and Fox-affiliated stations in select cities where the service is available. PlayStation Vue shut down on January 30, 2020. YouTube TV and Philo are other examples of OTT services.

Conventional broadcast and cable networks also launched OTT services during 2014 and 2015 to primarily reach cord-cutters – most of which are younger adults, particularly around college age, and to combat online copyright infringement of their programming. These networks include CBS (launched CBS All Access in October 2014, featuring both on-demand content and live streams of the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates), HBO (in April 2015, launched HBO Now, a standalone internet-only subscription service similar to its TV Everywhere service HBO Go), and Showtime (which launched a VOD/live streaming service of the same name in May 2015).

Most of these services were initially subscription-based. Free, advertising-supported streaming services such as Pluto TV and Tubi TV are also available. These services generally do not offer most of the high-profile original content available on cable, satellite or subscription video services and instead package reruns and other archival programming into online-exclusive channels and other limited content.

Licensing and distribution companies such as Funimation, VIZ Media, Aniplex of America, Discotek Media, NIS America, Media Blasters, Eleven Arts, AnimEigo, Sentai Filmworks, GKIDS, Crunchyroll in North America, Madman Entertainment, Manga Entertainment, Anime Limited, Siren Visual, and Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and the United Kingdom, and even mainstream streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have sections, streaming services, and content within the streaming services with foreign media such as anime, manga, J-Pop concert recordings, and Asian drama. Some of them also include digital stores where you can buy branded merchandise on their websites.

==The business of television==

Over-the-air (OTA) commercial stations and networks generate the vast majority of their revenue from advertisements. According to a 2001 survey, broadcast stations allocated 16 to 21 minutes of programming time per hour to commercials. Most cable networks also generate income from advertisements, although most basic cable networks also receive subscription fees, which are the other main source of revenue for the cable operators. However, &quot;premium&quot; cable networks (such as HBO) do not air commercials; instead, cable television subscribers must pay an extra fee to receive this type of pay television service.

Networks traditionally allocate a portion of commercial time during their programs (usually totaling between five and 6 minutes per hour, depending on the length of the program being aired, sometimes less during sporting events) to their local affiliates, which allow the local stations to generate revenue. In the same manner, in addition to subscription fees, cable television providers generate some of their revenue by selling local commercial time (usually allocating around four minutes per hour) for each advertiser-supported cable network it carries. However, while much of this time is sold to local and national advertisers, portions of the allocated commercial time are reserved by network affiliates and cable providers for in-house advertising (cable providers use some of this time to carry commercials for their services, which may also include business solutions, residential telephone and broadband internet services; network affiliates, as do other commercial broadcast stations, use this reserved time to carry promotions for their programming or station imaging).

Cable companies are required by the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act to negotiate for retransmission consent, usually paying broadcasters for the right to carry their signals. This provision, over time, has resulted in problems between pay television providers and companies that own subscription television services as well as those own and/or operate over-the-air television stations, as disagreements over terms in retransmission contracts sometimes arise during negotiations to renew and (occasionally) strike new agreements to carry certain channels. The carriage disputes that occur because of these differences typically result in broadcast stations or cable channels being pulled for a protracted period of time, often due to carriage fee increases that a provider may consider to be too expensive (since retransmission consent fees are a form of subscriber fee, any increase in fees that a provider carries will be passed on to the subscriber, which providers are hesitant to do out of concern that it may result in subscriber defections due to the resulting rate increases for program packages).

==Programming==
American television has had very successful programs that have inspired television networks across the world to develop shows of similar types. Some of these shows are still on the air and some have maintained decent runs in syndication. Conversely, many programs produced for U.S. television are also routinely syndicated to broadcasters in other countries, and a number of popular American programs have been based on shows that originated in other countries, especially the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Canada.

===News===

The major networks (besides Fox) all offer a morning news program, with CBS&#x27;s &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as standard bearers, as well as an early-evening newscast anchored by the &quot;de facto&quot; face of the network&#x27;s news division like Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather for CBS; Chet Huntley, David Brinkley and Tom Brokaw for NBC; and Peter Jennings for ABC. Successful news magazines have included &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; in prime time, and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot; on Sunday mornings.
Local news programming airs on many television stations, with individual markets supporting as few as two or as many as eight television news operations, depending on the number of available viewers that live in the market. Most stations originally aired locally produced newscasts only in evening time periods (usually at 6:00 and 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. local time) until the 1970s or as late as the mid-1980s on some stations. During that period, stations began local news programs in the midday and 5:00 p.m. time slots, while morning newscasts began to become common during the 1980s (first on weekdays, with weekend morning newscasts launching in many cities beginning in the early 1990s).

Two television stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, KYW-TV and WPVI-TV, were the respective progenitors of two popular news formats that shaped the modern presentation of television news, &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;, which had reporters present their stories instead of having the anchor read them, and became popularized after the format expanded to WABC-TV in New York City in 1968, and &quot;Action News&quot;, which placed set time limits on story packages presented during the program, to cover a broader array of stories. WPVI was itself heavily influenced by the sensationalist approach of WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York under Irv Weinstein, after the two stations&#x27; parent companies merged in 1972. WSVN in Miami also served as a pioneer in 1989, when the station joined Fox as part of a complicated six-station affiliation swap in two South Florida markets. Originating a news-intensive format with a heavy emphasis on tabloid journalism, crime stories, sensationalistic headlines and empathetic, emotional anchors, WSVN was regarded by a Frank Magid consultant as an update to &quot;Action News&quot; and &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;, and was soon copied or emulated by other stations throughout the country.

Cable news channels traditionally carry blocks of more generalized news coverage during the morning and afternoon hours; programs focusing on politics (that are similar in format to the Sunday morning talk shows) and documentaries typically air on these channels during prime time and late night, with general news coverage during that time usually limited to occasional coverage of breaking news events.

News programs make up a considerable amount of daily cable television viewership. Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC collectively average around 4 million viewers during prime time daily. Some of the most watched TV broadcasts in history were the moon landing (125 million), Nixon&#x27;s resignation speech (110 million), and the O.J. Simpson police chase (95 million). However, viewership has been declining over the recent years with the advent of alternate news sources such as social media.

===Game shows===
The game show has been one of the longest-running formats in American television history; game shows have aired regularly since the &quot;CBS Television Quiz&quot; began regular broadcasts in 1941.

Game shows have typically followed one of several formats, some of which overlap. &quot;Quiz shows&quot; tend to be more serious in demeanor and are based on trivia, with their appeal drawn from the intelligence of the contestant and the often high prize payouts; they often air in prime time or fringe time were a major fad in the 1950s before a wide-ranging scandal exposed most of the quiz shows of the era (such as &quot;Twenty One&quot;, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;, &quot;Dotto&quot; and &quot;The Big Surprise&quot;) as either rigged or outright fabricated and triggered major reforms. The fallout from the scandal led to stricter limits on game show prizes that lasted for the rest of the 20th century. High-stakes quiz shows made a comeback in the late 1990s, particularly with the American adaptation of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and an uptick in interest in the long-running answer-and-question quiz &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; under host Alex Trebek.

Panel games featured a panel of celebrities or news personalities interacting with a contestant. Mark Goodson and Bill Todman were particularly well known for their panel games, which ranged from more erudite interview programs such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; to comedy-driven shows such as the &quot;Match Game&quot;. Audience participation games, while having had a place in American television since the beginning with early examples including &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; and Dennis James&#x27;s &quot;Okay, Mother&quot;, gained popularity in the late 1960s and 1970s with &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; (hosted and co-produced by Canadian Monty Hall) and the 1972 revival of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; hosted by Bob Barker and (for its first five years in syndication) Dennis James; they changed the nature of game shows in that their atmosphere was more raucous than most panel games and quiz shows. Word guessing games are a format particularly associated with Bob Stewart, whose games involved celebrities giving clues to civilians (or vice versa) to guess a mystery word; examples included &quot;Password&quot; and &quot;Pyramid&quot;. Survey games, in which contestants attempt to guess the results of polls, can be seen in the form of shows such as &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;America Says&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; (which also incorporates a card game element) and &quot;Power of 10&quot;. Puzzle games involve large-sized versions of common childhood games, including hangman (&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;), tic-tac-toe (&quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;), crossword puzzles (&quot;The Cross-Wits&quot;, &quot;Merv Griffin&#x27;s Crosswords&quot;, &quot;People Puzzler&quot;), and video games (&quot;Starcade&quot;, &quot;Nick Arcade&quot;); Heatter-Quigley Productions produced a large number of puzzle games. Games that involve physical stunts include children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Double Dare&quot; and adult shows such as &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; and &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. A few game shows do not fit neatly into any of these descriptions; one such example is &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, a grocery-shopping contest that became a cult hit on cable television in the 1990s under host David Ruprecht.

Loosely fitting the description are dating shows. Chuck Barris was famous for the format; his &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and (notorious) &quot;3&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; pioneered the format, with other entries including &quot;Bzzz!&quot;, &quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;Singled Out&quot;, &quot;Love Connection&quot; and &quot;Baggage&quot;.

Game shows have historically been associated with daytime television in the United States. Quiz shows have typically aired in prime time, but ABC increased its output of non-quiz games in prime time beginning in the mid-2010s with its &quot;Fun &amp; Games&quot; format, to substantial success.

===Soap operas===

The soap opera genre experienced a gradual decline beginning in the 1980s due to the continued migration of women into the workplace, culminating in five soaps being canceled by NBC, CBS and ABC between 2007 and 2011 (of those, one, &quot;Passions&quot;, moved to DirecTV-owned network The 101 for one additional season after its cancellation by NBC in 2007, while &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; were revived on Hulu for one additional season in 2013 with those series&#x27; second cancellations resulting from a dispute between originating broadcaster ABC and the production company that acquired them, Prospect Park, over various issues).

Soap operas have also become common in prime time, which differ from their daytime counterparts as they use the traditional weekly format and maintain a visual style traditional of other nighttime network series (particularly, nighttime soaps are recorded on film in a single-camera setup, whereas daytime soaps are shot on multiple cameras that record the program on videotape). Prime time soaps of note have included &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Scandal&quot;.

===Comedies and dramas===
Comedy programming on American television has been more noted for situation comedies such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;Modern Family&quot;. However, there have also existed sketch comedy/variety series during prime time such as &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. The most prominent as well as the longest-running sketch comedy program is &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a late-night series which debuted on NBC in November 1975, and has spawned the careers of many popular comedic actors (such as Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Dennis Miller and Will Ferrell).
In the last 30 years, comedic adult animation has grown significantly. Popular shows such as The Simpsons, Beavis and Butt-Head, Family Guy, South Park, Futurama, American Dad, Rick and Morty, Bob&#x27;s Burgers, Robot Chicken, King of the Hill, Daria, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Duncanville, and more have came out during this time period. Others, like Bless the Harts and Clone High have more tame themes but still are not meant for children. Most adult animated cartoons air on Adult Swim, Comedy Central, FOX, TBS, MTV, The WB, NBC, Spike TV, and FXX.

Dramatic series have taken many forms over the years. Westerns such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (the longest-running prime time scripted drama series in U.S. television history, having aired from 1955 to 1975) and &quot;Bonanza&quot; had experienced their greatest popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. Medical dramas such as &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; have endured success; as well as family dramas such as &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;7th Heaven&quot;; and crime dramas such as &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;.

Dramedy, a term for a television series that mixes elements of comedy and drama, have seen its popularity grown among viewers, thanks to programs like &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;Devious Maids&quot;, &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot; and &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot;.

Television series featuring fantasy and science fiction are also popular with American viewers, since these programs take elements of comedy, drama, adventure, or a combination of all of the above. Among the most notable fantasy series in this genre include &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; (both centering on angels helping humans in times of personal crisis), &quot;Bewitched&quot; (a sitcom centering on a witch adjusting to married life with a mortal male), &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (which was set at a resort where people live out their fantasies, but at a price), &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (an anthology series known for its twist endings), &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; (focusing on a deceased model inhabiting the body of a lawyer) and &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (centering on fairytale characters that are trapped in the present day after the enactment of a curse). Science fiction series were originally more child-oriented, taking cues from film serials of the era (such as &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;). &quot;Star Trek&quot; pioneered adult-oriented science fiction during its three-year run in the late 1960s and spawned seven spin-off series–two in syndication (&quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;), three on network television (&quot;The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;) and two exclusively streamed on the Internet (&quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Picard&quot;). The film franchise &quot;Star Wars&quot; has spawned a number of television productions over the course of its existence, ranging from the Star Wars Holiday Special to &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

===Reality television===
Reality television has long existed in the United States, both played for laughs (such as &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and &quot;Real People&quot;) and as drama (such as &quot;COPS&quot; and &quot;The Real World&quot;). A new variant – competition series placing ordinary people in unusual circumstances or in talent contests, generally eliminating at least one participant per week, exploded in popularity in turn of the millennium (with shows such as &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and its spin-off &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; and &quot;The Voice&quot;).

===Talk shows===

The most successful talk show has been &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, particularly during the 30-year run of third host Johnny Carson. &quot;Tonight&quot; ushered in a multi-decade period of dominance by one network – NBC – in American late-night programming and paved the way for many similar programs combining comedy and celebrity interviews, such as &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Despite initial failed attempts during the late 1980s by Fox as well as the success of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in syndication during its first five-year run beginning in 1989, the late-night talk show genre would not become a more competitive field until the 1990s, when CBS gained a major foothold in the field with the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;; competition in the genre increased even further as cable networks entered into the genre in the 2000s and 2010s with the rise of parody news show &quot;The Daily Show&quot; under host Jon Stewart and newer shows such as &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Conan&quot;.

Daytime talk show hits have included &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; (and its previous iterations with Regis Philbin as co-host), &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;Rachael Ray&quot;, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, &quot;Ricki Lake&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot; which run the gamut from serious to lighthearted in topicality and format; a subset of so-called &quot;trash TV&quot; talk shows such as &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, which hit their peak during the 1990s, also veered into exploitation and titillation. Most daytime talk programs air in syndication, with various attempts airing on network television to mixed results among the more notable network efforts are the female-driven panel talk shows &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;The Talk&quot;, The Real and &quot;Get It Girl&quot; on LATV.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
Children&#x27;s television programs are also quite popular. Early ventures into children&#x27;s television in the 1950s aired on weekdays with shows such as &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Mr. Wizard&quot;, and the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. However children&#x27;s programing had experienced its greatest success on Saturday mornings from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. Programs shown during these time periods mainly consisted of animated programming including classic cartoons (such as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;), reruns of prime time animated sitcoms (such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;), foreign acquisitions (such as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, and &quot;Speed Racer&quot;), animated adaptations of films and television series (such as &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;), and original programs (such as &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;).

Some locally produced children&#x27;s programs – which often mixed cartoons, special guests and audience-participation games – also became popular in the local markets where they were broadcast; one of the most popular was the Bozo the Clown franchise, which became most well known for its Chicago version, which began airing nationally when WGN-TV became a superstation in October 1978.

However, in 1990, due to concerns regarding commercial advertising and cross-promotion in children&#x27;s programs by parental advocacy groups, the Federal Communications Commission passed the Children&#x27;s Television Act, legislation that among other provisions requires all broadcast television networks and stations to air at least three hours of educational children&#x27;s programming each week. This has made it much harder for broadcast stations to profit from children&#x27;s programs than was possible in previous years, eventually leading the major broadcast networks to abandon traditional scripted programs in favor of unscripted educational series with formats appealing to a more generalized audience to fulfill the requirements; noncommercial networks are exceptions to this new standard, as PBS Kids in particular has long excelled in providing E/I-compliant children&#x27;s programs that mix educational and entertainment content (such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; and &quot;Arthur&quot;).

Since the mid-2000s, popular children&#x27;s programs have been produced for cable networks such as Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network that are targeted at the demographic and only provide educational content voluntarily – in which case, it is primarily aimed at preschool-aged children and relegated to morning hours, unless incorporated full-time as part of the channel&#x27;s format, as is the case with the spin-offs of the former two aforementioned networks Nick Jr. Channel and Disney Junior – as they are not bound by the Children&#x27;s Television Act&#x27;s guidelines. Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network also have blocks that air late at night (&quot;Adult Swim&quot;, &quot;Nick at Nite&quot;), that mainly show sitcoms, original and syndicated animation, and Japanese anime which have adult themes such as gore, sexual situations, and profanity.

===Instructional television===
Adult instructional television, other than a few niche programs (such as the agriculture-themed &quot;Ag PhD&quot;), has typically been the province of noncommercial television. &quot;The Joy of Painting&quot;, which during the lifetime of host Bob Ross was seen on public television, exploded in popularity several years after Ross died as younger viewers came to appreciate Ross&#x27;s kind and quiet style of teaching oil painting, prompting his estate to reintroduce the show by way of various online media. The home improvement series &quot;This Old House&quot; is unusual among American television series in that it is available to both commercial and noncommercial broadcasters. In the form of expository bible readings, instructional television is a staple of religious broadcasting. A common form of instructional television, both noncommercially (such as &quot;The French Chef&quot; with Julia Child or Martin Yan&#x27;s &quot;Yan Can Cook&quot;) and commercially (such as Mr. Food and Paula Deen), is the cooking show, in which the host demonstrates various recipes that home viewers can prepare themselves.

===Professional wrestling===
Professional wrestling had been aired on local television during its earliest days and began to be aired in national television during the 1950s. It underwent a resurgence in the 1980s as Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation and Ted Turner&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling (WCW) each built rivalling national wrestling empires. During the Monday Night War of the 1990s, WWF and WCW maintained a heated televised rivalry. The boom eventually collapsed by the turn of the millennium, and McMahon purchased WCW in 2001 and an upstart hardcore promotion, Paul Heyman&#x27;s Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and merged them into WWF to form the modern WWE. WWE maintains a dominant presence in professional wrestling; its largest rival as of 2020 is All Elite Wrestling. Other would-be rivals Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Ring of Honor (ROH) also have a presence on American television (the latter primarily as a result of its 2011 acquisition by television station owner Sinclair Broadcast Group; ROH suspended operations and was sold to AEW in 2022).

Regional professional wrestling circuits may see some national exposure through syndication; &quot;Championship Wrestling from Hollywood&quot; and Ohio Valley Wrestling have national carriage. Foreign wrestling promotions such as Lucha Underground and New Japan Pro-Wrestling have seen increased exposure in the 2010s.

===Sports===

The broadcasting of sports events is a major component of the American commercial television industry. Sports tend to draw a large, wealthy audience that can command large sums of revenue from advertising and subscription fees.

In the early days of television, sports quickly became a fixture of American broadcast television. Boxing was carried on almost every television station and network since the beginnings. The sport earned a negative reputation after Emile Griffith killed his opponent on national television in a 1962 contest, followed by the death of Davey Moore from an indirect in-ring injury during another televised contest a year later; by 1964, boxing was off national television. The rise of pay-per-view and premium channels led to most of the highest-profile matches returning to the airwaves via subscription television. While it still maintains a limited (and rising, thanks to the efforts of Premier Boxing Champions) presence on American broadcast television, boxing has declined in popularity since the 1990s with mixed martial arts, a more broad-based combat sport, rising to take its place.
The major professional sports leagues began regular television broadcasts in the 1950s. The National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s embrace of television broadcasting at the early onset of the medium helped boost its popularity as a sport, and by the 1960s, the combined success of NFL and American Football League (AFL) telecasts helped earn professional football a status as a mainstay of the major television networks. American television pays the NFL billions of dollars each year to maintain their television rights; the Super Bowl, in return, is a cash windfall for the network which airs it as the broadcaster which holds the rights in a given year (which is rotated annually among the broadcast networks that hold rights to the league&#x27;s regular season and playoff games) can make hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from advertising sales alone. Major League Baseball (MLB) has been televised on U.S. television since the inception of the medium, most notably by way of a &quot;Game of the Week&quot; that has usually aired on Saturdays on various broadcasters since 1954.

The National Hockey League (NHL), in contrast, was much slower to embrace television, due to its initially regional nature and greater reliance on Canadian television, though it would begin broadcasting its events nationally on a wider basis after Fox acquired the rights to the league&#x27;s game broadcasts in 1995; the NHL has struggled to gain competitive ratings for most of its time on television.

College sports have also been a feature of American television. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) restricted television broadcasts of college football, as well as college basketball, from the early 1950s until 1984. In the latter year, the Supreme Court struck down the NCAA&#x27;s collective television contract as a violation of antitrust law, deregulating the sale of college sports telecasts and allowing individual teams and athletic conferences to negotiate their own deals with broadcast and cable networks.
Other sports that have maintained a regular presence on U.S. television include auto racing (NASCAR, in particular, rose rapidly in television popularity in the 1990s; the IndyCar series has also had some presence, particularly its signature event, the Indianapolis 500), professional golf (prominently through the Professional Golfers Association of America [PGA], Ladies Professional Golf Association [LPGA], and the United States Golf Association [USGA]), thoroughbred racing (particularly, the Triple Crown and Breeders Cup) and ten-pin bowling. Televised poker, while not an athletic sport, has been treated as a sport of sorts, with a boom in poker broadcasting between 2003 and 2011, after which federal pressure cut off most of the broadcasts&#x27; sponsors. Other sports have been televised through anthology series such as &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; (that same network would launch a documentary-based anthology, &quot;ESPN Sports Saturday&quot;, in 2011), &quot;CBS Sports Spectacular&quot; and &quot;NBC SportsWorld&quot;, sometimes through time-buy arrangements with event organizers.

Sports broadcasts are carried through a number of televised media. Most of the major sports have some presence on commercial broadcast television, including all NFL regular season and most playoff games. National cable networks, beginning with ESPN in 1979 (along with its later sister channels that gradually launched beginning in the 1990s) and later joined by competitors such as NBCSN and Fox Sports 1, carry packages of assorted major professional and college sports. The vast majority of MLB, NHL and National Basketball Association (NBA) games are carried through regional sports networks, however the NFL only permits preseason games to air on RSNs on a limited basis (the league otherwise prohibits regular season and playoff games from airing on regional sports networks, but does permit national cable networks to acquire the rights to air them); the leagues (as well as the NFL) restrict the broadcast of their sports on regional networks to specific territories and require any person outside those territories to purchase an out-of-market sports package to watch the majority of their favored team&#x27;s games. Regional sports networks can also provide outlets for minor league sports to broadcast their events. Unlike in some other countries, public television does not own any sports rights, nor has it ever been a major factor in sports television.

===Imported programming===
While the majority of programs broadcast on American television are produced domestically, some programs carried in syndication, on public television or on cable are imported from other countries – most commonly, from the primarily English-speaking countries of Canada and the United Kingdom. PBS in particular, is commonly known for its broadcasts of British sitcoms (such as &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;), which typically air on its member stations on weekend evenings (although their scheduling is at the discretion of the station as these programs are primarily syndicated on behalf of outside distributors); PBS was also responsible for bringing the hit period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; to the U.S. and for initially popularizing the long-running science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the country (the latter show now airs first-run episodes on BBC America, an outlet launched in 1998 that was specifically designed to bring BBC programming direct to the United States, although through channel drift it now mainly carries American programming; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; continues to be syndicated to public television stations and, in reruns, is also syndicated to commercial digital multicast networks such as the Retro Television Network).

The minimal differences between General American English and Standard Canadian English accents allow Canada to export shows to the United States, and vice versa, without a major culture barrier. Many of the programs imported from Canada are children&#x27;s programs originally aired by channels such as YTV and Family Channel (such as &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That On Television&quot;, &quot;Naturally, Sadie&quot; and &quot;Life with Derek&quot;). However, other Canadian series aimed at adults or more general audiences have also been syndicated in the United States; one network, Ion Life (a spin-off of Ion Television), has much of its schedule composed of reruns of since-discontinued Canadian lifestyle series. Among some of the more well-known Canadian television series among American viewers include the &quot;Degrassi High&quot; franchise (which aired in Canada on CBC Television, with the later incarnation &quot;&quot; airing on CTV and presently MuchMusic), &quot;Rookie Blue&quot;, &quot;SCTV Network&quot; and &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. Australian television shows have occasionally appeared on American television, but these have historically been limited to children&#x27;s series (such as &quot;Bananas in Pajamas&quot; and &quot;The Wiggles&quot;) and teen dramas (such as &quot;Ship to Shore&quot; and &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot;).

Programming from Japan has had a niche market in American television, with some anime programs (generally dubbed into English) having been seen on American television since the 1960s. Channels that air such anime include Adult Swim, Disney XD, Nicktoons, TOKU, &quot;Neon Alley&quot;, the Anime Network, Animax, and Aniplus. The &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series was heavily edited from a Japanese live-action tokusatsu series, &quot;Super Sentai&quot;, with newly filmed bridging sequences involving American actors (as the action sequences were entirely done in full costume, those scenes only had to be dubbed). The success of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; led to a wave of tokusatsu adaptations in the mid-1990s, none of which survived beyond two years. More recently Japanese live-action series started to be shown in the country by Netflix, examples include Atelier, , Samurai Gourmet and Alice in Borderland.

European television series also started to be shown in the country, mainly after the rise of streaming services, with Netflix being the main exhibitor of such programs in the United States. Examples include the Norwegian series Occupied, Ragnarok and Nobel; the Icelander series The Valhalla murders; the Danish series Rita and The Rain; Italian series ; the German series Babylon Berlin, Dark and Unorthodox; the French series Call My Agent!, Osmosis, La Mante, A Very Secret Service; the Spanish series Money Heist, Cable Girls and Elite. The South Korean thriller series &quot;Squid Game&quot; became an unexpected hit in the United States in 2021 through its appearance on Netflix. France has also contributed a number of computer-animated series to American television in the 21st century, among them &quot;Rabbids Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Garfield Show&quot; and &quot;Grizzy and the Lemmings&quot;.

American Spanish-language networks also import much of their programming; for example, Univision imports much of its programming, especially telenovelas that are broadcast on the network, from Mexican broadcaster Televisa, and MundoMax distributes programming from Colombian broadcaster and network owner RCN Television. In addition to being shown on free-to-air television, Latin American TV series are also shown through streaming services. Examples include the Argentine series El Marginal, the Mexican series La Casa de las Flores and the Brazilian series 3%.

===The life cycle of U.S. television shows===

Television production companies either commission teleplays for television pilots or buy spec scripts. Some of these scripts are turned into pilots for proposed television programs. The production company markets those they consider commercially viable to television networks – or television distributors for first-run syndication (for example, CBS Media Ventures distributes &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; in first-run syndication, because that show is syndicated – it is not carried on a particular network). A few things that a television network takes under consideration in deciding to order a show is if the show itself is compatible with the network&#x27;s target audience, the cost of production, and if the show is well liked among network executives, and in many cases, test audiences.

Networks sometimes preemptively purchase pilots to prevent other networks from controlling them – and the purchase of a pilot is no guarantee that the network will order additional episodes. In other cases, the network may be forced to commission the pilot to avoid shouldering monetary penalties if it is not produced. The producers hire a director and other crew members (in some cases, using staff employed with an existing series) to work on the pilot; in some cases, if the pilot&#x27;s concept was pitched by producers that would not write for the proposed show before a script is drafted, writers may also be assigned to pen the script and would be given credit as the series&#x27; creator(s). Pilots that do get &quot;picked up&quot; get either a full or partial-season order (starting with an initial order of between seven and 13 episodes, which may be extended if the program&#x27;s viewership is strong during the early run of episodes); the show goes into production, usually establishing itself with permanent sets. Writers, additional directors and some full-time crew members are hired, and work begins – usually during the late spring and summer before the fall season-series premieres (shows can also serve as a midseason replacement, meaning they are ordered specifically to fill holes in a network schedule created by the failure and cancellation of shows that premiered in the fall; &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot; are examples of successful midseason replacements). Unscripted series have a different stage of development, as the program is generally pitched only as a concept, often without a pilot being ordered or already produced.

The standard broadcast television season in the United States consists of 22 episodes (which are typically broadcast over a period of nine months from September to May, depending on the date on which the program begins its season), although prior to the 1970s, a single season of a weekly television program consisted of as many as 40 episodes, with few breaks in the show&#x27;s airing schedule. Sitcoms may have 24 or more; animated programs may have more (or fewer) episodes (some are broken up into two 11-minute shorts, often with separate self-contained storylines, that are folded into a single half-hour episode); cable networks with original programming seem to have settled on about 10 to 13 episodes per season, much in line with British television programming, though there are exceptions (particularly with cable networks specializing in children&#x27;s programming, which use the network television model of total per-season episode counts, but spread out the episodes over a single calendar year).

American soap operas air in the afternoon, five days a week, without any significant break in taping and airing schedules throughout the year. This means that these serials air approximately 260 episodes a year, making their cast and crew members the busiest in show business. These shows are rarely, if ever, repeated (unless the network chooses not to air a new episode on certain major holidays), making it difficult for viewers to &quot;catch up&quot; when they miss an episode, though the television networks&#x27; adoption of online streaming during the late 2000s has made it easier for viewers to watch recent episodes of a particular soap. Cable channel SoapNet provided weekly repeats for some broadcasts until it shut down in December 2013, after which TVGN (now Pop, and originally a television listings service formerly known under several names including the Prevue Channel) began airing same-day repeats of some network soaps.

Networks use profits from commercials that run during the show to pay the production company, which in turn pays the cast and crew, and keeps a share of the profits for itself (networks sometimes act as both production companies and distributors, though due to the vertical integration of networks and major media companies since the 1990s, production arms operated by the broadcast networks have largely been absorbed into the existing production arms of their corporate parents). As advertising rates are based on the size of the audience, measuring the number of people watching a network is very important. This measurement is known as a show or network&#x27;s ratings. Sweeps months (which occur in November, February, May, and to a lesser extent July) are important landmarks in the television season – ratings earned during these periods determine advertising rates until the next sweeps period, therefore shows often have their most exciting plot developments happen during sweeps.

Shows that are successful with audiences and advertisers receive authorization from the network to continue production, until the plotline ends (only for scripted shows) or if the contract expires. Those that are not successful are often quickly told to discontinue production by the network, known as &quot;cancellation&quot;. There are instances of initially low-rated shows surviving cancellation and later becoming highly popular, but these are rare. For the most part, shows that are not immediately or even moderately successful are cancelled by the end of November sweeps, if not shortly thereafter or earlier. Usually if a show is canceled, there is little chance of it ever coming back again especially on the same network it was canceled from; the only show in the U.S. to ever come back from cancellation on the same network is &quot;Family Guy&quot; (which was cancelled by Fox in 2002 and was revived by the network in 2005 due to the increased popularity of the series through reruns on cable and DVD releases). However, canceled shows like &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Southland&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; have been picked up by other networks, which is becoming an increasingly common practice; similarly, in the 2010s, some programs cancelled by traditional television networks like &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Community&quot; and &quot;The Mindy Project&quot; have been picked up or revived by internet television streaming services. It is also somewhat common for series to continue production for the purpose of completing a DVD set, even if these episodes will never air on television (these episodes would, in years past, be &quot;burned off&quot; by airing them in less-prominent time slots).

Once a television series reaches a threshold of approximately 88 to 100 episodes, it becomes a candidate to enter reruns in off-network syndication. Reruns are a lucrative business for television producers, who can sell the rights to a &quot;used&quot; series without the expenses of producing it (though they may have to pay royalties to the affected parties, depending on union contracts). The sale of previously aired programs to other outlets, including the Internet, television stations outside the United States and traditional off-network syndication, constitutes up to half of an individual show&#x27;s revenue stream as of 2017, with the other half coming from first-run advertising.

Sitcoms are traditionally the most widely syndicated reruns and are usually aired in a five-day-a-week strip (standardly with two episode &quot;runs&quot;, separate sets of episodes of a particular program that are usually from different seasons, packaged for stations to air back-to-back or in different time slots), and in most cases, with additional weekend runs consisting of two (or in some cases, four) additional episodes. Marginally performing shows tend to last less than three to five years in broadcast syndication, sometimes moving to cable channels (although rerun packages of some series are sold simultaneously into both broadcast syndication and cable, and sometimes to more than one cable network) or into limited-run barter syndication (such as through The Program Exchange) after the end of their syndication runs, while more widely successful series can have a life in syndication that can run for decades (&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, the first series designed to be rerun, remains popular in syndication more than 60 years after its 1951 debut).

Cable and digital broadcast networks have provided outlets for programming that either has outlived its syndication viability, lacks the number of episodes necessary for syndication, or for various reasons was not a candidate for syndication in the first place. Popular dramas, for instance, have permanent homes on several basic cable channels, often running in marathons (multiple episodes airing back-to-back for several hours), and there are also cable channels devoted to game shows (Game Show Network and Buzzr), soap operas (the now-defunct SoapNet), Saturday morning cartoons (Boomerang) and even sports broadcasts (ESPN Classic). Digital broadcast networks specializing in classic television programming that have become popular since the early 2010s have also served as short-term or long-term homes for many older series that have not been syndicated in decades or have ever been aired in reruns. Most reality shows perform poorly in reruns and are rarely seen as a result, other than reruns of series still in production, on the same network on which they air (almost always cable outlets), where they air as filler programming.

==Regulation==
Broadcast television is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC awards and oversees the renewal of licenses to local stations, which stipulate stations&#x27; commitments to educational and public-interest programming. During the early years of commercial television, the FCC permitted a single company to own a maximum of five television stations nationwide (later raised to seven stations in 1984 and then to twelve in 1992), although until the 1960s, very few companies outside of the major broadcast networks owned multiple stations. Since a change to its media ownership regulations in 1999 that counted television station ownership maximums by a national market percentage rather than by the number of stations that could be allowed in their portfolio, FCC rules mandate that the total number of television stations owned by any company can only reach a maximum of 39% of all markets in the U.S. Until 2016, a &quot;discount&quot; allowed a broadcaster to cover up to 78% of the U.S. with UHF signals; this loophole was closed in 2016, although existing companies above the 39% threshold will be covered under a grandfather clause and, although they will not be allowed to acquire any more stations, they will also not be forced to sell their existing portfolios.

Most commercial stations are now owned-and-operated or controlled through outsourcing agreements by group owners (either independent companies or network-owned subsidiary groups), with a relatively limited number of companies that remain which own stations in five or fewer markets; a series of station purchases that have occurred since 2011 (when the Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the Four Points Media Group) has concentrated the number of station owners even further, as a result of increasing competition between over-the-air broadcasters and subscription television outlets as well as to increase leverage in negotiations with cable and satellite providers for retransmission consent (which since the early 2000s, has increasingly become a primary form of revenue for broadcast networks, which have required their affiliates to share a portion of the revenue received by pay television providers as an additional source of operational revenue).

Outsourcing agreements (known by multiple terms, mainly local marketing agreements [LMA], shared services agreements [SSA] or joint sales agreements [JSA], albeit with little differentiation in their structure) have allowed some broadcasting companies to operate stations that they could otherwise not legally own outright due to in-market ownership regulations; these arrangements first began in 1991, when the Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into such an arrangement to run WPTT (now WPNT) in Pittsburgh, after it sold the station to its manager Edwin Edwards to acquire Fox affiliate WPGH-TV. However, as companies like Sinclair and the Nexstar Media Group have used outsourcing as loopholes around ownership regulations at the expense of independent (and particularly, minority) ownership, the FCC has made attempts to restrict broadcasters from using them, passing a rule in April 2014 that disallowed all JSAs in which one company sells 15% of advertising for another station and required all existing ones to be unwound within five years (the National Association of Broadcasters backed a provision passed as part of a November 2015 Congressional budget bill that extended to the time limit to unwind existing JSAs to ten years).

The FCC also previously barred companies from owning more than one television station within a single market, unless it operated as a satellite station (a full-power station that relays programming from its parent station to areas within the market that are not adequately covered if at all by the main signal) or a low-power station (either one that maintains its own programming or operates as a translator); however, it eventually allowed operators of public television stations to sign-on or acquire a second station that did not repeat the parent&#x27;s signal (some of which were originally licensed as commercial outlets). In August 1999, the FCC legalized the common ownership of two commercial stations, known as duopolies, if one of them is not among the market&#x27;s four highest-rated, and if there are at least eight companies that each own full-power stations within the market. While the parent companies of NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox are not prohibited from owning a second broadcast network (and all of them, except for ABC, are co-owned with one), an FCC law known as the &quot;dual-network rule&quot; does disallow a single company from owning two or more of the major networks; this came into play in 2019, when ABC&#x27;s parent company bought most of Fox&#x27;s assets but was required to leave Fox as a separately owned network.

The FCC also prohibits the airing of &quot;indecent&quot; material over-the-air between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 pm. Broadcast stations can legally air almost anything they want late at night – and cable networks at all hours. However, nudity and graphic profanity are rare on American television. Though the FCC gives them leeway to air programs containing &quot;indecent&quot; material within its designated watershed period, broadcasters are hesitant to do this, concerned that airing such material would alienate advertisers and encourage the federal government to strengthen regulation of television content. Premium cable networks are exceptions, and often air very racy programming at night, though premium channels often air program content with strong to graphic profanity, violence and nudity in some cases during the daytime hours. Such content is common on pay television services, as they are not subjected to FCC regulations and pressure from advertisers, and often require a subscription to view them. Some networks (such as Playboy TV) are devoted exclusively to &quot;adult&quot; content, specifically pornographic material, and therefore viewers may find scenes of simulated or graphic sexual intercourse and nudity on such channels.

Cable television is largely, but not entirely, unregulated. Cable providers must include local over-the-air stations in their offerings on each system (stations can opt to gain carriage by seeking a must-carry option) and give them low channel numbers, unless the stations decide to demand compensation of any sort (through retransmission consent). The systems cannot carry broadcast network affiliates from other parts of the country (this regulation has largely been openly ignored in recent years during carriage disputes), however cable systems can carry stations from nearby markets if there are no local stations affiliated with one of the major networks (though this is becoming far less common with the shift, particularly since 2006, towards over-the-air stations carrying one network affiliation on their main channel and an affiliation with another network on a digital subchannel, thus allowing these network-affiliated digital subchannels to be carried at least via digital cable).

Cable systems can also air satellite-relayed broadcast stations originating from other areas of the United States, known as superstations (of which there are currently only five around the country), which for the most part are often aired in rural areas and may omit network programming from that station&#x27;s network affiliation; all superstations, are currently affiliated with a broadcast television network: WPIX in New York City, KWGN-TV in Denver and KTLA in Los Angeles are all affiliated with The CW, and WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey and WSBK-TV in Boston are affiliated with MyNetworkTV. A few of these superstations once had national distribution, carrying a separate feed that aired different programming than that of the local area feed and even some that also aired on the local feed that is SyndEx-proof (in other words, syndicated programming to which the superstation has obtained full signal rights to air nationally); the two most prominent of these nationally distributed stations were TBS and WGN-TV. TBS, whose former parent Atlanta station WTCG (now WPCH-TV) became the first &quot;basic cable&quot; network to be uplinked to satellite in December 1976, had converted its national feed into a conventional cable channel in October 2007; WGN-TV in Chicago was uplinked in October 1978; its national feed, WGN America, also converted into a traditional cable channel in December 2014, when it dropped all remaining WGN-TV programming. WWOR-TV also once operated a national feed, which ceased operations in January 1997, before the station regained national superstation status as a satellite-exclusive service – through its New York City feed – a few months later.

The FCC has virtually no jurisdiction over the content of programming exclusively broadcast on cable. As a result, anyone is free to create any number of channels or any sort of programming whatsoever without consulting the FCC. The only restrictions are on the ability to secure carriage on cable or satellite (or, failing that, by streaming on Internet television) and securing the rights to programming. Because of this lack of restriction, channel drift (the shift of a channel&#x27;s programming format away from that which it originally maintained) is much more common in the United States than in other countries.

Because the United States had relatively weak copyright terms until 1976, a large body of older television series have lapsed into the public domain and are thus free to redistribute in any form.

== History of American television ==

Television debuted in the United States on May 10, 1928, with the launch of the original WGY Television, a joint venture of General Electric&#x27;s owned-and-operated WGY in Schenectady, New York and Norton Laboratories&#x27; WMAK in Lockport, New York. (Norton dropped out of the venture shortly thereafter and eventually folded in 1932 amid disputes with the FCC over its AM allocation. Generally regarded as the first television station in the United States, W3XK in Washington, D.C., started airing on July 2, 1928. Charles Francis Jenkins, a pioneer of early television technology, owned W3XK, which in 1929 upgraded to a 60-line picture after first transmitting 48-line silhouette images via a mechanical scanning mechanism. Despite being the first station to transmit to the public on a regular basis, it was hindered by technical issues and closed during the Great Depression in 1932. Western New York would not get a full-time television station until WBEN-TV launched in 1948.) These early television programs operated using low-bandwidth (and low-fidelity) mechanical television processes. Full-time broadcasts began in the early 1930s, particularly in New York City; these were almost exclusively studio-based shows, among them the murder mystery &quot;The Television Ghost&quot;, piano lessons and primitive variety shows. These shows and broadcasts ended in 1933, in part because of technological and economic limits caused by the Great Depression.
On April 30, 1939, RCA through its NBC division, introduced the first, regularly scheduled, 441-line electronic television service in the United States over New York City&#x27;s W2XBS (today&#x27;s WNBC) from a transmitter atop The Empire State Building as well as placing RCA television receivers on sale in the New York City vicinity. Television receivers were also sold by General Electric, DuMont Laboratories and other manufacturers during his period. NBC rival CBS established their own electronic television station in New York at the time, W2XAB (today&#x27;s WCBS-TV) as well as the DuMont Laboratories establishing their station W2XWV (today&#x27;s WNYW). Although television sets were available for sale during this period (1939–1941) and three channels were operating in New York City, sales were slow, primarily due to a lack of compelling programming, limited broadcast schedules and the high price of the sets. In 1941, The National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) standardized on a 525-line system, and authorized the official start of advertising-based, commercial television. This would provide the basis for television across the country through the end of the century. On July 1, 1941, W2XBS became commercial WNBT (now WNBC) and broadcast the first paid advertisement for the Bulova Watch Company. On the same day, the CBS station became commercial WCBW (now WCBS-TV).

Television development halted with the onset of World War II, but a few pioneer stations remained on the air throughout the war, primarily WNBT, WCBW and WABD (the former W2XWV, which became commercially licensed in 1944, owned by the DuMont Television Network, now WNYW) in New York City, WRGB in Schenectady, New York (owned by General Electric), WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia (owned by Philco), W9XBK (now WBBM-TV) in Chicago, as well as W6XAO (now KCBS-TV) and W6XYZ (now KTLA) in Los Angeles. When that conflict ended, these stations expanded their broadcast schedules, and many other organizations applied for television station licenses.

After a flood of television license applications, the FCC froze the application process for new applicants in 1948, due to concerns over station interference. There were barely more than 100 stations operating at the end of the freeze as of 1952, concentrated in many (but not all) major cities. After four years of deliberation, the FCC ended the license freeze. It reorganized the UHF band for television, then began handing out broadcasting licenses on both the UHF and VHF bands, with the highest concentration of license grants and station sign-ons occurring between 1953 and 1956. Many successful VHF stations launched. By comparison, UHF television reception at this time required either purchasing a more expensive television with a UHF tuner in it – as UHF tuners were not mandated by law in sets – or buying a conversion kit that added the band to VHF televisions. Both of these prevented consumer adoption of UHF in the mid-1950s, and most UHF channels which went to air during this time period did not survive.

A brief dispute over the system to use for color broadcasts occurred at this time, but was soon settled. Half of all U.S. households had television sets by 1955, though color was a premium feature for many years (most households able to purchase television sets could only afford black-and-white models, and few programs were broadcast in color until the mid-1960s).

Many of the earliest television programs were modified versions of well-established radio shows. Barn dances and opries were regular staples of early television, as were the first variety shows. Reruns of film shorts (such as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Our Gang&quot; and &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;) were also staples of early television and to a certain extent remain popular today, well after those film shorts mostly stopped being produced in the 1960s. The 1950s saw the first flowering of the genres that would distinguish television from movies and radio: talk shows like &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; and sitcoms like &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Although sitcoms were a radio fixture since the late 1930s (many 1940s radio sitcoms jumped directly to television), television allowed far greater use of physical comedy, an advantage that early television sitcoms used to its full potential.

Other popular genres in early television were westerns, police procedurals, suspense thrillers and soap operas, all of which were adapted from the radio medium. Anthology and wheel series thrived in the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Television&quot;, but eventually faded in popularity by the 1970s. The big band remote, for the most part, did not survive (a victim of the concurrent start of the rock era), with two exceptions: &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, a big band-driven musical variety show, ran from 1951 until Welk&#x27;s retirement in 1982 and in reruns from then onward (which eventually moved from commercial to public television syndication), and Guy Lombardo&#x27;s annual New Year&#x27;s Eve big-band remotes ran until 1979, two years after Lombardo&#x27;s death. Game shows were also a major part of the early part of television, aided by massive prizes unheard of in the radio era; however, the pressure to keep the programs entertaining led to the quiz show scandals, in which it was revealed many of the popular high-stakes games were rigged or outright scripted. The Saturday morning cartoons, animated productions made specifically for television (and, accordingly, with much tighter budgets and more limited animation), also debuted in the late 1950s. Major advancements during the 1950s include VHF band expansion and UHF frequency opening to expand the number of usable channels. The NTSC color television standard was approved in 1953, regular color broadcasts started in 1954, and maximum video resolution increased from 525 to 625 lines.

These advancements significantly enhanced viewers&#x27; television experiences and hastened the incorporation of television into everyday life. The typical American household was watching television for more than five hours every day by 1960. Television had become a significant cultural and economic force.

Broadcast television stations in the United States were primarily transmitted on the VHF band (channels 2–13) through the mid-1960s. It was not until the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1964 that UHF broadcasting became a feasible medium.

The quality of American television underwent a marked decline in the late 1950s and early 1960s as anthology series disappeared from the network schedules in favor of an oversaturation of westerns, rural and fantasy sitcoms, cheaply animated cartoons and often-violent action-adventure series. Newton Minow famously lambasted the networks for creating a &quot;vast wasteland&quot; of bad television in his 1961 speech &quot;Television and the Public Interest.&quot; Though Minow&#x27;s attempts to exhort the networks into producing better programming failed to make a major impact, his advocacy for UHF (to expand viewer choices) and non-commercial educational television had a much longer legacy.

Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, concurrent with the development of color television, the evolution of television led to an event colloquially known as the rural purge; genres such as the panel game show, western, variety show, barn dance and rural-oriented sitcom all met their demise in favor of newer, more modern series targeted at wealthier suburban and urban viewers. The rural purge was largely initiated by CBS and other influential networks, impacting the entirety of the industry. Around the same time, videotape became a more affordable alternative to film for recording programs.

Stations across the country also produced their own local programs. Usually carried live, they ranged from simple advertisements to game shows and children&#x27;s shows that often featured clowns and other offbeat characters. Local programs could often be popular and profitable, but concerns about product promotion led them to almost completely disappear by the mid-1970s. The last remaining locally originated shows on American television are local newscasts, public affairs shows and some brokered programming (such as talk-lifestyle shows) paid for by advertisers.

Subscription television networks emerged in the late 1970s, first as over-the-air encrypted enterprises such as OnTV and SelecTV. Subscription television largely migrated to cable television through the early 1980s, as providers began to offer dedicated channels alongside local and out-of-market broadcast stations and cable service gradually expanded to more metropolitan areas. Analog television receive-only had a brief uptick in popularity during the mid-1980s, but never achieved competitive parity with cable providers of the time. Direct-broadcast satellite television experienced its breakout in the mid-1990s, with the emergence of digital (DSS) transmission; it has been growing in significance since then – spurring the emergence of multinational conglomerates such as Fox. As the number of outlets for potential new television channels increased, this also introduced the threat of audience fracturing, in that it would become more difficult to attain a critical mass of viewers in this highly competitive market.

Infomercials were legalized in 1984, approximately the same time that cable television became widespread. Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, stations began airing infomercials – as well as news and entertainment programs – throughout the night instead of signing off; infomercials also began to overtake other less-watched dayparts (such as weekends and during the daytime), which forced series that would otherwise be syndicated onto cable networks or off the air entirely. Cable networks have also begun selling infomercial space, usually in multiple-hour blocks in the early morning hours, while some dedicated channels devoted to infomercials have also launched since the early 1990s. Infomercials have earned a reputation as a medium for advertising scams and products of dubious quality, although by the same token, they have proven to be a successful method of selling products.

As ratings declined on daytime over-the-air network broadcast television, game shows and soap operas that were the staples of the 1970s and 1980s began to disappear going into the 21st century, with both genres becoming near-obsolete by 2020. They were gradually replaced by much cheaper and more lowbrow tabloid talk shows, locally produced news, and even infomercials. Binding arbitration court shows became popular in these timeslots beginning in the late 1990s.

In the late 1990s, the U.S. began to deploy digital television, transitioning it into being the standard transmission method for over-the-air broadcasts. The major broadcast networks began transitioning to recording their programs in high definition (HD); prime time programs were the first to convert to the format, with daytime shows eventually being converted to HD beginning in the mid-2000s; the upgrade to full high-definition network schedules, at least among the conventional English language broadcast networks, was fully completed by September 2014 when the last standard-definition programs upgraded to HD. A law passed by Congress in 2006 required over-the-air stations to cease analog broadcasts in 2009, with the end of analog television arriving on June 12 of that year (originally set for February 17, before Congress delayed it due to concerns about national household penetration of digital television by viewers reliant on antennas for receive programming in advance the transition). Low-power television stations originally had until September 2015 to terminate analog broadcasts, a deadline that was later postponed and eventually took effect in July 2021. The 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction further compressed the UHF band, eliminating channels 38 through 51, and was completed in 2020. Most of the remaining stations on analog in 2021 were stations that exploited a loophole to carry a radio station on the audio feed of analog channel 6, which was audible on 87.7 MHz, a frequency that can be tuned in on most FM radios; a limited number of stations that were using that loophole were granted special temporary authority to continue broadcasting their analog audio feeds while shifting their video feeds to the new and upcoming digital television standard, ATSC 3.0, which is being phased in across the United States in the early 2020s with no hard transition date yet set.

The late 1990s also saw the invention of digital video recorders. While the ability to record a television program for home viewing was possible with the earlier VCRs, that medium was a bulky mechanical tape medium that was far less convenient than the all-digital technology that DVRs use (DVD recorders also began to be sold around this time, though this is also less convenient than the DVR technology since DVD discs are somewhat more fragile than videotapes, although both mediums allow to some extent for longer-term viewing than most DVRs). DVR technology allowed wide-scale time shifting of programming, which had a negative impact on programming in time slots outside of prime time by allowing viewers to watch their favorite programs on demand. It also put pressure on advertisers, since DVRs make it relatively easy to skip over commercials (satellite provider Dish Network&#x27;s Hopper technology, which eliminates commercials entirely, was even the subject of lawsuits by the major networks during the early and mid-2010s due to fears over diluted advertising revenue).

During the 2000s, the major development in U.S. television programming was the growth of reality television, which proved to be an inexpensive and entertaining alternative to scripted prime time programming. The process of nonlinear video editing and digital recording allowed for much easier and less expensive editing of mass amounts of video, making reality television more viable than it had been in previous decades. All four major broadcast networks carry at least one long-running reality franchise in their lineup at any given time of the year.

== Social consequences of television ==
Television had, and still has, an array of social consequences, including historical, political, and economic consequences, as well as broad discrimination. Television was gaining popularity and becoming available to the public as the Vietnam War was taking place. Prior to the presence of television, the American public had little knowledge of the circumstances of war, and television provided constant and current graphic images and stories of war coverage. Broadcasting of these stories led to change in the public opinion of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War and there were more unfavorable views among the public. The Vietnam War became known as &quot;The Television War&quot;, as it was the first broadly televised conflict and provided frequent news coverage and images of the war. Television is not credited as being a factor in the United States removing troops from Vietnam, but rather the Watergate Scandal, funding for the war, and peace treaty are. 

Television influenced the political sphere within the United States. The presence of television created a new platform for candidates to campaign, and how these campaigns work have changed throughout time. The first political advertisements consisted of candidates on their political viewpoints and their opinions on current issues within the world. This began the &quot;selling&quot; of political candidates, by adding a song or jingle to sway public opinion in their favor. As time progressed, it became more common for political advertisements to be used to persuade the public to not vote for a particular candidate due to their viewpoints, ideas, and/or personal characteristics. On September 26, 1969, presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon participated in the first live, on-air presidential debate. Political debates have grown in popularity and now reach audiences in the tens of millions.

The first television broadcast occurred on September 7, 1927, when there was a very limited number of televisions owned by the public across the country. Within the first two decades of the invention and distribution of television, the average price of the television set was between $200 and $600. This price equated to roughly 15-22% of the average annual salary during the 1930s and 1940s. The upper-class society was the target audience of this new technology, as those in the lower-class did not have the income to support such a purchase. Not only did this limit television access to those of the upper class, but it also limited television to particular regions of the United States. During the 1930s and 1940s, the upper-class lived in primarily populated and urban cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia. After World War II and the Industrial Revolution, the price of televisions decreased significantly and became more attainable for those who were not in the position to purchase one previously.

When television first began consistent broadcasting programs in the late 1930s and 1940s, there were only four networks available: NBC, ABC, CBS, and DuMont Television Network. In 1959, Max Robinson became the first African American nightly news television anchor. During Robinson&#x27;s news segments, he was covered by the broadcasting company&#x27;s logo. He was fired the following day after having the logo removed from his segment. Robinson then went on to work at WTOP-TV and WRC-TV, gaining fame for his presence in the Civil Rights Movement. Throughout the next several decades, news anchors continued to be predominantly white males. Following the Civil Rights Movement, there was a stronger presence of African American news anchors, although they are still underrepresented. In the United States, only 6.4% of news anchors are African American while African Americans account for over 14% of the United States population.

<text>The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act (SALSRA,) is a bill of the United States Congress passed into law on December 12, 2003.

The bill&#x27;s stated purpose is to end what the United States sees as Syrian support for terrorism, to end Syria&#x27;s presence in Lebanon, which has been in effect since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990, to stop Syria&#x27;s alleged development of WMDs, to cease Syria&#x27;s illegal importation of Iraqi oil and to end illegal shipments of military items to anti-US forces in Iraq.

The bill was sponsored by Representative Eliot L. Engel (D) from New York and was introduced April 12, 2003.

==2013 Ghouta chemical attack==
In response to the use of chemical weapons against civilians during the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, president Barack Obama asked Congress to authorize the use of military force against Syria. An early draft of that authorization cites the Syria Accountability Act, saying:
Whereas in the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Congress found that Syria’s acquisition of weapons of mass destruction threatens the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States.

<doc id="519155" wikidata="Q1455879" url="?curid=519155" title="Terrell Brandon">
<text>Thomas Terrell Brandon (born May 20, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player. He played for three teams during his 11-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A two-time All-Star, Brandon was a key starter on three NBA franchises before a series of injuries ultimately forced him to play his last game at 31 years old.

==Early life and education==
Brandon was born in Portland, Oregon and attended Grant High School, where he led his team to the 1988 Class AAA Oregon high-school basketball championship, being named Oregon high school player of the year. As a child, he suffered from chronic foot deformation.

==College career==
Brandon attended the University of Oregon, leading his team to the National Invitational Tournament (NIT) in 1989–90 as a sophomore. He then went on to hold several school records: career- and single-season scoring average, assists in a single game (13), single-season steals (twice), and single-game steals (eight). Brandon earned team MVP honors in 1990 and 1991. After being an honorable mention All-American, he became the first Oregon player to leave school early for the NBA.

==NBA career==

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1991–1997)===
Brandon was selected 11th overall in the 1991 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. After a strong rookie season, Brandon was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. He spent his first three and a half seasons as the backup to All–Star point guard Mark Price. On December 21, 1993, Brandon scored 18 points and recorded 14 assists coming off the bench in a win over the Utah Jazz. Filling in for an injured Price during the 1994–95 season, Brandon responded by leading Cleveland on an 11–game winning streak. After the season, Cleveland traded Price to Washington. On February 15, 1995, Brandon scored 31 points on 12–15 shooting from the field, alongside recording 8 assists and 4 rebounds, in a 100–99 win against the Orlando Magic.

As Cleveland&#x27;s starting point guard, Brandon earned consecutive All-Star Game appearances in 1996 and 1997, the second of which Cleveland hosted. Between these selections, on December 22, 1996, Brandon scored 33 points, recorded nine assists, grabbed six rebounds, and stole the ball four times in a 100–94 win over the Utah Jazz, which was notable as he was primarily guarded by all-time great John Stockton. Sports Illustrated labeled him &quot;The Best Point Guard in the NBA&quot; in a 1997 issue, the year he led the Cavaliers in points, assists and steals. He was also awarded the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 1997, for his work with underprivileged youth.

===Milwaukee Bucks (1997–1999)===
In September 1997, Cleveland traded Brandon to the Milwaukee Bucks. In the trade, Cleveland also sent Tyrone Hill and a top 10 protected draft pick to the Bucks; Milwaukee sent Sherman Douglas to Cleveland and Vin Baker to the Seattle SuperSonics, who dealt Shawn Kemp to Cleveland. Though Cleveland was not looking to trade Brandon, the team felt they could not pass over the opportunity to trade for a superstar of Kemp&#x27;s caliber. On December 7, 1997, Brandon scored 20 points, recorded 13 assists, and grabbed seven rebounds in a 97–91 win over the SuperSonics. On January 5, 1998, Brandon again helped lead the Bucks to a victory, scoring 16 points and recording 15 assists in a 98–92 win against the Portland Trail Blazers.

Despite success on the court, injuries limited him to just 50 games in his first season with the Bucks, and Milwaukee struggled without him playing. Brandon was among the league leaders in steals and led the team in assists during his two-year stint with the Bucks. Though he expressed interest in playing in Milwaukee long-term with Ray Allen, the Bucks feared they would be unable to re-sign Brandon or continue to lose his playing time to injuries and did not want to risk losing him without return.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (1999–2003)===
On March 12, 1999, after just 15 games in his second Milwaukee season, Brandon was traded to Minnesota in a three-team, nine player trade that sent Sam Cassell to Milwaukee and Stephon Marbury to the New Jersey Nets.

Paired with Kevin Garnett, Brandon helped lead Minnesota to their first 50-win season in 1999–2000 with averages of 17 points, 9 assists and 2 steals per game. However, he was often plagued by injuries and on February 13, 2002, he was placed on the injury list by the Timberwolves, from which he did not return. It was during his stint with the Timberwolves that Brandon would get to team up and mentor Chauncey Billups.

On July 23, 2003, Brandon was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for salary cap purposes. He was waived by the Hawks on February 19, 2004, two years and 13 days after his last game, and he subsequently announced his retirement.

Brandon finished his career averaging 13.8 points, three rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game, and came within six points of scoring 10,000 in his career. His career-high for assists registered in a game was 16, which he accomplished five times. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.

Brandon now runs the Terrell Brandon Barber Shop on Portland&#x27;s Northeast Alberta Street, which is frequented by numerous NBA players. He is also a real estate developer and is CEO for Tee Bee Enterprises and Tee Bee Enterprise Music.

Brandon has two sons, Trevor, Terrell Jr, from a college relationship. His father, Charles, was a supply store supervisor for Oregon Health Sciences University, and was also an assistant pastor in a Pentecostal church. Brandon&#x27;s mother, Charlotte, was one of the founders of Mothers of Professional Basketball Players, an organization for mothers of NBA players. Though Brandon was considered &quot;underpaid&quot; by NBA standards, he told his mom to retire immediately after he signed his first contract.

===Extortion attempt===
In late February 2008, Brandon and former NFL defensive back Anthony Newman were the victims of an extortion attempt. Both Brandon and Newman received letters demanding money. Brandon and his friend, Timothy Upshaw, went along with the letter&#x27;s request for Brandon to leave a bag outside of his garage with money inside (though they only placed a single dollar bill and plain paper in the bag). Bobby Hayes, the man responsible for the letters, arrived to retrieve the bag when he was confronted by Upshaw. Police were later called to the scene after a resident heard men talking about killing someone. Bobby Hayes was brought into custody and later released on bail, receiving orders not to contact Brandon, Newman or their families.

<doc id="519158" wikidata="Q17900" url="?curid=519158" title="Same-sex adoption">
<text>Same-sex adoption is the adoption of children or adults by same-sex couples. It may take the form of a joint adoption by the couple, or of the adoption by one partner of the other&#x27;s biological child or adult (stepchild adoption). 

Joint adoption by same-sex couples is permitted in 39 countries. Most countries and territories that allow same-sex marriage (exceptions being Aruba, Curaçao, Ecuador and several Mexican states), as well as several countries and dependent territories that do not (Bolivia, Croatia, Israel and two UK territories of Bermuda and the Cayman Islands) allow for same-sex joint adoption. In some of the countries with marriage, legislation for adoption preceded that for marriage.

Adoption is only permitted for same sex married couples in 21 of the 31 Mexican states and Mexico City, despite a Supreme Court ruling that requires states to allow it. Stepchild adoption is permitted for same-sex couples in two countries without same-sex marriage - San Marino and Czechia permits step-child adoption in which the registered partner can adopt the biological and, in some cases, the adopted child of his or her partner.

Given that constitutions and statutes usually do not address the adoption rights of LGBT persons, judicial decisions often determine whether they can serve as parents either individually or as couples. Opponents of adoption by same-sex couples have argued that LGBT parenting adversely affects children. However, research consistently shows that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents.

Same-sex parents pursuing adoption must also contend with social pressures to conform to heteronormative gender roles. The concept of gender role models is necessitated by the bureaucratic organization of foster care and adoption agencies, particularly in the United States.

==LGBT parenting==

=== Prevalence of adoption ===
Statistics on the prevalence of adoption by same-sex couples across countries where it is legal are not consistently available.

In 2022, 1 in 6 adoptions in England were by same-sex couples. This number was a 17.4% rise from the previous year.

In the United States, as of 2024, 18% of all LGBTQ people (~2.57 million adults) parent children in their homes, with 14% of same-sex couples (167,000) parenting a minor in their homes. 21% of same-sex couples adopt which is a much higher rate than in different-sex couples (3%).

=== Quality of life outcomes ===

A common argument against the legalization of same-sex adoption is that children adopted by same-sex couples would have poorer quality of life outcomes. Overall, scientific research indicates that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well as the children of different-sex couples.

A 2004 study concluded that the sexual orientation of parents did not predict better or poorer &quot;adoptive family functioning, adopted child&#x27;s behavior, and parent&#x27;s perceptions of helpfulness from family support networks&quot;.

A 2010 study evaluated the outcomes of young adopted children who had been placed in one of 56 lesbian and gay households since infancy. The study found no significant associations between parental sexual orientation and child adjustment.

Research published in 2009 studied 1,384 children with either heterosexual or same-sex adoptive parents and concluded that problematic behavior in children was not dependent on whether they had same-sex or opposite sex parents. The study also found that &quot;adoptive parents are likely to encounter similar challenges in terms of risk factors for child behavioral problems and mitigating factors of such behavior.&quot;

A 2016 study of adopted children of same-sex parents showed that they perceive themselves to be more accepting, understanding and compassionate than children of different-sex parents. The children in the study also indicated that they often avoid sharing that their parents are lesbian or gay, and that many experience bullying or teasing.

==Debate==
===Arguments===
The adoption of children by LGBT people is an issue of active debate. In the United States, for example, legislation to prevent adoption by LGBT people has been introduced in many jurisdictions; such efforts have largely been defeated. Prior to 1973, state courts commonly barred gay and lesbian individuals from holding a parenting role, especially through adoption.

Major professional organizations have made statements in defense of adoption by same-sex couples. The American Psychological Association has supported adoption by same-sex couples, citing social prejudice as harming the psychological health of lesbians and gays while noting there is no evidence that their parenting causes harm. The American Medical Association has issued a similar position supporting second parent adoption by same-sex partner, stating that lack of formal recognition can cause health-care disparities for children of same-sex parents.

The following arguments are made in support of adoption by LGBT parents:
*The right of a child to have a family, guardians or people who can take care of their wellbeing.
*Human rights – child&#x27;s and parent&#x27;s right to have a family life.
*There are almost no differences between children raised by same-sex or straight couples. For that reason, sexual orientation of the parents has almost no relevance when it comes to raising a child.
*Evidence confirming that, despite the claims of those opposed to LGBT+ parenting, same-sex couples can provide good conditions to raise a child.
*For children, adoption is a better alternative to orphanage.
*Fewer formalities for step-parents in everyday life, as well as the situation of a death of a biological parent of a child.

In Italy step-child adoption can only be recognized by court order since 2016.

===Africa===

====South Africa====
South Africa is the only African country to allow joint adoption by same-sex couples. The 2002 decision of the Constitutional Court in the case of &quot;Du Toit v Minister of Welfare and Population Development&quot; amended the Child Care Act, 1983 to allow both joint adoption and step-parent adoption by &quot;permanent same-sex life partners&quot;. The Child Care Act has since been replaced by the Children&#x27;s Act, 2005, which allows joint adoption by &quot;partners in a permanent domestic life-partnership&quot;, whether same- or opposite-sex, and step-parent adoption by a person who is the &quot;permanent domestic life-partner&quot; of the child&#x27;s current parent. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2006, and is equivalent to opposite-sex marriage for all purposes, including adoption.

===Americas===

==== Argentina ====
Argentina allows adoption by same and different-sex marriages, and even by single people, since 2010. The law makes no difference in the requirements for adoption for any of these.

==== Canada ====
Canada has no nation-wide law legalizing same-sex adoption, but rather has smaller provincial laws that cover the entire nation. Same-sex adoption legalization in Canada began with British Columbia in 1996 and was finalized with Nunavut in 2011. By 2013, an Ipsos Global poll showed 70% of Canadians approved of same-sex adoption to some degree with 45% strongly approving.

====Chile====
Since March 10, 2022 joint parenthood of same-sex couples is legal in Chile after the entry into force of Law 21,400 on Equal Marriage, which explicitly guarantees non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity for custody purposes, filiation and adoption whether or not the couples are married or whether or not they had their children through assisted human fertilization. The law amends the Civil Code to recognize the parents of children as their mother and/or father, their two mothers, or their two fathers.

A 2021 survey, shows that 65% of Chileans support same-sex adoption.

====Colombia====
On 4 November 2015, in a 6-2 Constitutional Court ruling, Colombia decided to allow adoption by LGBT peoples. The ruling came before same-sex marriage became legal in the country on 28 April 2016.

==== Cuba ====
Cuba allows adoption by same-sex marriages (since September 2022 referendum) and different-sex marriages, and even by single people.

==== Honduras ====
As of May 2019, the Honduras Supreme Court is expected to rule on a decision regarding both same-sex marriage and adoption.

====Mexico====
Same-sex couples are able to adopt in Mexico City (since 2010), Coahuila (2014), Campeche (2016), Colima (2016), Michoacán (2016), Morelos (2016), Veracruz (2016), Baja California (2017), Chihuahua (2017), Querétaro (2017), Puebla (2018), Chiapas (2018), Nayarit (2019), Aguascalientes (2019), Hidalgo (2019), San Luis Potosí (2019), Quintana Roo (2022), Yucatan (2022), Durango (2022), Tamaulipas (2022), Guerrero (2022), Nuevo Leon (2023), Tabasco (2024).

In Mexico City, the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District passed legislation on 21 December 2009 enabling same-sex couples to adopt children. Eight days later, Head of Government (&quot;Mayor&quot;) Marcelo Ebrard signed the bill into law, which officially took effect on 4 March 2010.

On 24 November 2011, the Coahuila Supreme Court struck down the state&#x27;s law barring same-sex couples from adopting, urging the state&#x27;s legislature to amend the adoption law as soon as possible. On 12 February 2014, the state&#x27;s congress overwhelmingly approved the measure more than two years following the supreme court decision.

On 3 February 2017 the SCJN emitted tesis 08/2017 in which it is stated that the family of the LGBT community doesn&#x27;t end with a couple, but that it also extends onto the right to have and raise children. Therefore, LGBT couples wishing to form a family and adopt children will be legally protected and can&#x27;t be limited by any governmental entity.

In October 2021, a bill was introduced to the legislature of Baja California Sur.

In September 2022, a bill was passed in Quintana Roo.

====United States====

In 1979, Reverend John Kuiper of the Metropolitan Community Church and his husband became the first gay men in America to win the right to adopt a child. Adoption by LGBT individuals or same-sex couples is legal in all fifty states as of June 2017.

====Uruguay====
A government-sponsored adoption law in Uruguay allowing LGBT adoption was approved by the lower house on 28 August 2009, and by the Senate on 9 September 2009. In October 2009, the law was signed by President and took effect. According to Equipos Mori Poll&#x27;s, 53% of Uruguayans are opposed to same sex adoption against 39% that support it. Interconsult&#x27;s Poll made in 2008 says that 49% are opposed to same sex adoption against 35% that support it.

===Asia===
LGBT rights for adoption of children in Asia are almost nonexistent, except in Israel, Thailand (TBD) and Taiwan. Some Asian countries still criminalize same-sex activities and do not have anti-discrimination laws, which are obstacles for legislating for LGBT adoption.

====Israel====
The issue of same-sex adoption has been the subject of a long-running political and legal battle in Israel that was resolved in December 2023, when the Israeli Supreme Court interpreted existing law to allow same-sex adoptions, as the law gives absolute priority to the welfare of the child and not to the gender of its parents.

====Taiwan====
Until 2023, members of same-sex couples could only adopt the biological child of their spouse (so-called stepchild adoptions). Taiwan law allowed for opposite-sex married people to jointly adopt, and also allowed single individuals to adopt, depending on the circumstances, including individual LGBT people. The same-sex marriage law only granted same-sex couples the right to adopt children genetically related to one of the spouses.

===Europe===

In February 2006, France&#x27;s Court of Cassation ruled that both partners in a same-sex relationship can have parental rights over one partner&#x27;s biological child. The result came from a case where a woman tried to give parental rights of her two daughters to her partner, with whom she was in a civil union. In the case of adoption, however, in February 2007, the same court ruled against a lesbian couple where one partner tried to adopt the child of the other partner. The court stated that the woman&#x27;s partner cannot be recognized unless the mother withdrew her own parental rights. On 17 May 2013, French President François Hollande signed into law the bill that opened marriage and adoption rights linked to it for same sex couples.

In 1998, a nursery school teacher from Lons-le-Saunier, living as a couple with another woman, had applied for an authorization to adopt a child from the &quot;département&quot; (local government) of Jura. The adoption board recommended against the authorization because the child would lack a paternal reference, and thus the president of the &quot;département&quot; ruled against the authorization. The case was appealed before the administrative courts and ended before the Council of State, acting as supreme administrative court, which ruled against the woman. The European Court of Human Rights concluded that these actions and this ruling were a violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights taken in conjunction with Article 8.

On 2 June 2006, the Icelandic Parliament unanimously passed a proposal accepting adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment for same-sex couples on the same basis as heterosexual couples. The law went into effect on 27 June 2006.

In Bulgaria, according to the Ministry of Justice the laws regarding adoption &quot;lack a norm, concerning the sexual orientation of the individuals&quot;. Therefore, a single gay person or same-sex couples may adopt.

On 17 May 2013, the Portuguese parliament approved a bill in first reading allowing &quot;co-adoption&quot; of the biological or adopted child of the same-sex spouse or partner, where that spouse or partner is the only legally recognized parent of the child (e.g. the mother with the natural father not being registered). However, in October 2013 members of parliament opposed to the bill proposed a referendum on the issue and killed a motion to have the second vote in the plenary; the motion on the possible referendum was then considered, but the Constitutional Court declared it unconstitutional. On 14 March 2014, the original bill was rejected in second reading. On 20 November 2015, 5 proposals from several left-wing parties were voted favourably by the new parliament as result of 4 October General Elections.

In July 2014 through Life Partnership Act Croatia recognized an institution similar to step-child adoption called partner-guardian. A partner who is not a biological parent of a child can share parental responsibilities with a biological parent or parents if they agree to it, or if the court decides it is in the best interest of a child. Additionally, a biological parent or parents can temporarily give a partner who is not a biological parent full parental responsibilities. A partner who is not a biological parent can also gain permanent parental responsibilities through an institution of partner-guardian if both biological parents of a child have died, or exceptionally if a second biological parent of a child is unknown, and if the court decides it is in the best interest of a child.

In January 2015, the Constitutional Court of Austria found the existing laws on adoption to be unconstitutional and ordered the laws to be changed by 31 December 2015 to allow joint adoption by same-sex couples in Austria.

On 6 April 2015, the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 passed by Parliament in March 2015 which extends full adoption rights to cohabiting couples and those in civil partnerships was promulgated by the President of Ireland. The law went into effect a year later on 6 April 2016.

On 20 November 2015 the Portuguese Parliament approved; by 141 votes against 87 with 2 abstentions; a diploma presented by all the parties (except the right-wing PàF) to allow same-sex adoption. On 26 January 2016, the conservative Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva vetoed the bill and a week later the Portuguese Parliament overridden the veto. The law went into effect on 1 March 2016.

On 22 June 2016 the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation upheld a lower court&#x27;s decision to approve a request for a lesbian to adopt her partner&#x27;s daughter. Prosecutors had appealed against the decision by the Rome court of appeal. Decisions by the supreme court set a precedent.

In December 2020, Hungary explicitly legally banned adoption for same-sex couples within its constitution.

In April 2021, a court in Croatia ruled that same-sex partners have the right to adopt children. In May 2022, the High Administrative Court affirmed the ruling and rejected the appeal of the responsible Ministry.

In June 2022, the Constitutional Court of Slovenia ruled that same-sex partners have the right to jointly adopt. On 4 October 2022, the National Assembly (lower chamber of Slovenian parliament) passed the relevant act implementing this judgement, but a week later, the act was vetoed by the National Council (upper chamber of the parliament). This is to be followed by another vote on the act in the National Assembly and potentially a national referendum.

Estonia and Greece since 2024, allows full-joint adoption of children by same-sex couples - along with same-sex marriage being legalized at the same time.

On 1 January 2025, the Czechia will allow same-sex couples “partial adoption” of their own biological child or children - but not full joint adoption.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, same-sex adoption is legal in all states and territories since April 2018.

====New Zealand====
The Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013, which came into force on 19 August 2013, allowed same-sex marriage and permitted married same-sex couples to jointly adopt children. Previously, an LGBT individual was able to adopt children, but same-sex couples could not adopt jointly.

Currently, there are no specific barriers preventing an LGBT individual from adopting children, except that male individuals cannot adopt a female child. Same-sex marriage law became effective from 19 August 2013, and since then married same-sex couples were able to adopt children jointly. Unmarried couples of any sex and couples in a civil union can now jointly adopt children, under a New Zealand High Court ruling in December 2015. The ban breached the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The minimum age to adopt in New Zealand is 20 years for a related child, and 25 years or the child&#x27;s age plus 20 years (whichever is greater) for an unrelated child.

<doc id="519161" wikidata="Q38965" url="?curid=519161" title="Weimaraner">
<text>The  is a German breed of hunting dog of medium to large size, with history going back at least to the nineteenth century.

It originated in the area of the city of Weimar (then in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, now in the state of Thuringia), for which it is named. It was recognised as a breed in 1891. It is an all-purpose gun dog, characterised by its speed and stamina, its good nose and eye, and its courage and intelligence; in Germany it is not considered suitable for keeping as a companion dog.

== History ==

Many theories of the origin of the Weimaraner have been advanced, but there are few documented historical facts; silver-grey dogs are shown in paintings by Antoon van Dyck in the seventeenth century and by Jean-Baptiste Oudry in the eighteenth. The breed is believed to have originated in the area of the city of Weimar (then in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, now in the state of Thuringia) – the city from which its name derives. It is sometimes claimed that the dogs were kept at the court of Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, in the early nineteenth century.

From 1879 the dogs were considered to be a blue variant of the German Short-haired Pointer, and were eligible for registration in the stud-book of the . They first appeared at a dog show in 1880, when fourteen examples were presented in Berlin. These were of three differing types, from three different kennels: the traditional Thüringer Hund; the Weißenfelser Hund, which was rather more elegant; and the Sanderslebener, which was intermediate between the two. The Weimaraner was recognised as a distinct breed in 1891. A breed standard was drawn up in 1896, and in 1897 a breed association was established in Erfurt with the name ; this was soon changed to .

In the early years of the twentieth century – the time of the Great War – the Weimaraner came close to extinction; it was reconstituted from the few surviving examples of the breed.

It was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1954.

In the fifteen years from 2007 to 2021, the annual number of new registrations in Germany averaged about 485, with a low of 390 and a high of 607.

== Characteristics ==
The Weimaraner is of medium to large size: dogs stand some at the withers, bitches about ; weights are in the range for dogs, for bitches.

The coat may be either short or long; a double coat of intermediate length is sometimes seen. The coat may be mouse-grey, roe-grey or silver-grey in various shades, or of a colour intermediate between these; minor white markings to the feet and chest are tolerated. The eyes are amber, ranging from pale to dark; the ears are pendent, with rounded tips.

Among the neurological diseases associated with the Weimaraner are cerebellar hypoplasia, hypomyelinogenesis and spinal dysraphism. Other diseases or defects to which it has some genetic or statistical predisposition include corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, eversion of the cartilage of the nictitating membrane, generalised demodicosis, medial canthal pocket syndrome, refractory corneal ulceration and XX sex reversal, and also – in dogs only – Weimaraner neutrophil dysfunction, pododermatitis and tricuspid dysplasia.

A 2024 UK study found a median lifespan of 12.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

== Use ==

The Weimaraner is a versatile hunting dog, and may be used to track, point to, flush or retrieve birds or other game. Registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial. In Germany it is not considered to be suitable for keeping as a companion dog. According to the breed club, it &quot;... basically belongs in the hands of hunters due to its development and its characteristics ... It is not a companion dog, but a hunting dog through and through. As such, it needs work in practical hunting in order to preserve its balanced nature&quot;; whelps are placed mainly with hunters.

<text>Bengali cuisine is the culinary style of Bengal, that comprises Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, and Assam&#x27;s Karimganj district. The cuisine has been shaped by the region&#x27;s diverse history and climate. It is known for its varied use of flavours including mustard oil, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts. There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple, with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are preferred to seafish, although barramundi, known as &quot;bhetki&quot;, is also common. Meat is also a common protein among Bengalis with chicken, mutton meat being the most popular. Beef is popular within the muslim community. In more recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of the diet. Many Bengali food traditions draw from social activities, such as adda, Poila Boishakh, Eid and Durga Puja.

==Culinary influences==
===Mughal influence===
Muslims conquered Bengal around the mid-thirteenth century, bringing with them Persian and Arabic cuisine. Such dishes as &quot;biryani&quot;, &quot;korma&quot; and &quot;bhuna&quot; had once been meals of the higher courts, but the cooks of the Mughals brought their recipes to the lower and middle classes. The influence was reinforced during the rule of the British Raj, where Kolkata became the place of refuge for many prominent exiled Nawabs, notably the family of Tipu Sultan from Mysore and Wajid Ali Shah, the ousted Nawab of Awadh. The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and &quot;masalchis&quot; (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they became interspersed into the local population. These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably &quot;jafran&quot; and mace), the extensive use of &quot;ghee&quot;, and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.

In Bangladesh, this food has become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they have remained the food of professional chefs. Further innovations include &quot;chap&quot; (ribs slow cooked on a tawa), &quot;rezala&quot; (meat in a thin yogurt and cardamom gravy) and &quot;kathi&quot; roll (kebabs in a wrap).

The Mughals had a particular fixation on meat, bringing mutton and beef into mainstream Bengali cuisine as well as already known kinds of meat like chicken and venison.

Furthermore, traditional desserts had been primarily based on rice pastes and jaggery, but under Mughal influence moved towards significantly increased use of milk, cream, and sugar along with expensive spices such as cardamom and saffron.

===Influence of widows===
In Hindu tradition, widows were not allowed to eat foods that would not be classified as &quot;bitter&quot;, necessitating experiment and innovation. While most Bengali castes ate meat and fish, this was barred for widows. Widows also could not use &quot;heating&quot; foods such as shallot and garlic, but ginger was allowed. This style found a core place in Bengali curries in general, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Expensive spices such as saffron, cinnamon or cloves were used very sparingly—if at all. Nuts, dry fruits, milk and milk products (such as cream, ghee or curd) were similarly scarce. These economic and social restrictions influenced Bengali widows to create a brand new set of meals that utilized only vegetables and cheap spices.

===Partition of Bengal===
The large-scale displacement along religious lines as a result of the partition led to changes in meal-taking, so as to adhere to religious restrictions. In Bangladesh (former East Bengal and East Pakistan), Mughlai food is common, and includes foods that are less popular in West Bengal, such as beef kebab. Additionally, sweets such as zarda and firni-payesh are eaten. In rural Bangladesh, many people eat makna fried, popped, or raw.

During the colonial period, many Western food shops were established in Kolkata, making puff pastries, channa, chocolate, and chips especially popular. Dishes such as chop, gravy cutlet, sponge rasogolla, and ledikeni. As a result of a multi-cultural community, Kolkata city&#x27;s cuisine continuously changes, and takes heavy influence from Chinese and European palates.

==Characteristics==
Bengali cuisine can be subdivided into four different types of dishes: (খাদ্য, ভক্ষ্য, or ভোজ্য); , or , such as rice or fish; , or , such as ambal and tak; , or , like chutney; and , or which includes drinks, mainly milk.

== Regional specialties ==
Different parts of Bengal are famed for certain dishes, food items and ingredients. For example, South Bengali districts around the Sundarbans boast of the expensive &quot;chui jhal&quot; chilli, which they peel and chop into small pieces to be cooked in their dishes and give off a strong aroma. On the other hand, North Bengal are the homes of many Bengali desserts such as the Mishti doi of Bogra, the Kachagolla of Natore and the Chomchom of Porabari. However, other regions also have famous desserts like the &quot;Balish Mishti&quot; (pillow-sweet) of Netrokona, the Monda of Muktagachha, the Red Yoghurt of Nabadwip and the famed Roshmolai of Comilla.

===Chittagong===
Chittagonian Bengali culinary tradition is mostly known for Mezban and mixed rice dishes like kala bhuna, which has shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices. Dried fish (&quot;shutki&quot;) is more available in the Chittagong region than in other parts of Bengal.

====Mezban====

&quot;Mezban&quot; (locally known as &quot;Mejjan&quot;) is the Bengali word for special occasion feasts in the Chittagong region of Bangladesh. Historically Mezbani is a traditional regional feast where people are invited to enjoy a meal with white rice and beef, besides other dishes rich in animal fat and dairy. It is held on the occasions such as death anniversary, birth anniversary, celebrating successes, launching of a new business, entry into a new house, the birth of a child, marriage, aqiqah and circumcision, ear piercing of girls and naming of the newborn. The invitation of the Mezban ceremony generally remains open for all and various people to different places and neighbourhoods convey the invitation for the feast. In urban areas, attending a mezban is by invitation only. Usually, the consumption of food at Mezbani takes place from morning to afternoon.

Beef-based dishes are preferred by Bengali Muslims and are a symbol of social prestige for a Mezban feast. The rich and the poor arrange feasts on various occasions as much as circumstances allow them. It has a distinct style of cooking and proper Mezban meat demands a certain skill; for example: The unique beef curry served in this feast is known as &quot;Mezbani gosht&quot;, that carries a distinctive recipe, knowledge of which is essentially confined within the Chittagonian cooks.

Fish is used instead of beef while cooking Mezban in Hindu tradition. The Hindu community of Chittagong organises Mezbani each year under the banner of &quot;Chittagong Parishad&quot;, with curries made from fish, vegetable and dried fish.

===Dhaka===
Dhakaiya food is one of the most notable regional Bengali cuisines. The rich culinary customs are influenced by Mughlai, Central Asian, Armenian, Hindustani and native Bengali cuisines. However, it also has dishes unique to Dhaka. The Nawabs of Dhaka had brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal, that were wholly retained by Dhaka&#x27;s culinary community. Due to the high costs of producing Mughlai food, the recipes were limited to the elite classes in colonial India, and slowly expanded as Bangladesh&#x27;s economy grew. The main focus on lamb, mutton, beef, yoghurt, and mild spices define the taste of the style. Such dishes as kebab; stuffed breads; &quot;kacchi biriyani&quot;; roast lamb, duck, and chicken; &quot;patisapta&quot;; Kashmiri tea; and &quot;korma&quot; are still served at special occasions like Eid and weddings. Due to the high class of the food, using an excess amount of expensive ingredients like ghee, and making the food melt in one&#x27;s mouth were essential to the feel of the food.

Old Dhaka boasts a variation of the famous pilaf - the Morog Polao - in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Other include and . Dhakaiyas are noted for introducing paneer and boiled eggs to khichuri. Dhakai bakarkhani is a thick, biscuit-like flat-bread which is a traditional street-food snack, famed for its quality and taste. It is mainly dished up with tea. Dhakaiyas proudly hold a heritage of creating the best &quot;khili paan&quot; using various herbs and spices. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the &quot;paan afsana&quot;. Haji biryani is a dish, invented by a restaurateur in 1939, made with highly seasoned rice, goat&#x27;s meat and number of spices and nuts. The restaurant has become an integral part of Dhakaiya culture.

===Kolkata===

In Kolkata, many local street vendors own small shops from which they sell their own homemade goods. Items like cheeses (&quot;paneer&quot;) can be eaten as is, or can be made into sweet &quot;sandesh&quot;, &quot;rosomalai&quot;, &quot;rosogolla&quot;, or &quot;chanar payesh&quot;. Milk is especially used in Kolkata&#x27;s various types of payesh, differing in use of different grains and additives like dates, figs, and berries. In addition to European foodstuffs like chocolate, Kolkata takes culinary influence from its Chinese diaspora. &quot;Phuchka&quot;, known the rest of India as &quot;panipuri&quot;, is a common kind of Bengali street food made with a fried dough casing and a potato and chickpea filling, usually found in small stalls alongside bhelpuri, masala chai, ghugni and chaat stalls.

====Influences====
During the 19th century many Odia cooks migrated to Bengal to work in the households of affluent Kolkata families. They were also hired to cook in weddings and other family ceremonies. Introduction of Odia cooks into their kitchens brought in subtle but significant changes to Kolkata&#x27;s cuisine. Some of Kolkata&#x27;s classic dishes were originally from Odisha but were refined in Kolkata kitchens by Odia cooks. In fact some researchers say that dishes like &quot;kanika&quot; (Bengali &quot;mishti pulao&quot;) were first introduced to Kolkata kitchens by Odia cooks although this is contested by other researchers. Even to this date most of the cooks in Kolkata kitchens and hotels are Odia cooks.

The Chinese of Kolkata originally settled into a village called Achipur south of Kolkata in the late 18th century, later moving into the city and finally into its present home in Tangra at the eastern edge of Kolkata. The Chinese-origin people of Kolkata form a substantial and successful community with a distinct identity. With this identity came Chinese food, available at almost every street corner in Kolkata at present, due to the taste, quick cooking procedure, and no similarity with the original Chinese recipe other than the use of soy sauce. They were mostly Cantonese tradesmen and sailors who first settled down here and decided to cook with whatever items they had at hand.

Calcuttan immigrants to other countries have started carrying this abroad as well; Indian Chinese restaurants have appeared in many places in the United States and UK.

Indian Chinese food has been given a second boost in popularity since the 1950s when a large number of Tibetans migrated into Indian Territory, following the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s flight. Tibetans brought their own taste preferences to add to the genre, such as the popular momo (a kind of dumpling) or thukpa (a hearty noodle soup). Tibetans and Nepali immigrants found ready employment in the many kitchens that can now be found on virtually every street in Kolkata.

==== Adda ====

Adda () is a traditional Bengali means of socialising over food during the work day. Food taken during adda consists usually of mishti or sweetmeats, tea, and coffee, although heartier meats such as fried fish may be brought out as well.

The adda saw a rise during the colonial era among the Bhadralok guild members to meet and talk about a range of topics:&quot;You could be discussing Charles and Camilla&#x27;s marriage this moment, and the next moment you&#x27;re swinging over to the latest cricket series between India and Pakistan, and then swing back to the recent controversy over Tagore.&quot; Being a hobby for artisans, women were largely secluded from adda, a sentiment that has begun to disappear with the democratization of adda and women occupying a larger space in social life. For this reason, adda was seen as a refuge &quot;...from the home, a neutral rendezvous away from both the perceived drudgery of the workplace and domesticity&quot;.

In the post-colonial era, the adda has been fading due to the more rigid structure of work and exploitative perceptions of unnecessary laziness. This has inspired a sizeable movement of Bengalis who believe it integral to the idea of &quot;lyadh&quot;, or doing nothing to relax and recharge. However, adda does still exist, being attended during vacation time or after work at clubs or coffee shops. The tradition even has an equivalent to the Greek symposium, as students may meet for a study session over food or have a teacher teach in a more relaxed environment.

===Sylhet===
Sylhet boasts a variation of the famous pilaf dish – Akhni polao – in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Commonly consumed varieties of meat include beef, chicken, mutton and duck/goose in dishes such as Hash O Bash. They also proudly hold the heritage of Beef Hatkora, a rice dish consisting of a wild citrus fruit not found in other parts of Bengal.

During the British period, biscuits and loaves were introduced in Sylhet and received popularity within the Muslim community. The middle-class Hindus of Cachar and Sylhet however were very suspicious of biscuits and breads as they believed they were baked by Muslims. In one occasion, a few Hindus in Cachar caught some Englishman eating biscuits with tea which caused an uproar. The information reached the Hindus of Sylhet and a little rebellion occurred. In response to this, companies started to advertise their bread as &quot;machine-made&quot; and &quot;untouched by (Muslim) hand&quot; to tell Hindus that the breads were &quot;safe for consumption&quot;. This incident is mentioned in Bipin Chandra Pal&#x27;s autobiography and he mentions how gradually culinary habits of Hindus eventually changed.

== Utensils ==
Bengali food is often served on plates which have a distinct flowery pattern often in blue or pink. Another characteristic of Bengali food is the use the boti (also called &quot;dao&quot; or &quot;da&quot;). It is a long curved blade on a platform held down by one or both feet; both hands are used to hold whatever is being cut and move it against the blade, which faces the user. This method gives effective control over the cutting process, and can be used to cut anything from prawns to large pumpkins.

A korai is a cooking vessel for most Bengali sauces and stir-fry. The dekchi (a flat-bottomed pan) is used generally for larger amounts of cooking or for making rice. It comes with a thin flat lid which is used also to strain out the starch while finishing up cooking rice. The tawa is used to make roti and paratha. The other prominent cooking utensil is a hari, which is a round-bottomed pot-like vessel. The three mentioned vessels all come in various sizes and in various metals and alloys.

A flat metal spatula, khunti, is used often, along with hata (scoop with a long handle), jhanjri (round-shaped sieve-like spatula to deep-fry food), the shanrashi (pincers to remove vessels from the fire), the ghuntni (wooden hand blender) for puréeing dal, the wooden &quot;belun chaki&quot; (round pastry board and rolling pin), and the &quot;shil nora&quot;, which is a rough form of a mortar and pestle or grinding stone. The kuruni is used only to grate coconuts.

Silverware is not a part of traditional Bengali cookery.

===Historical===

Bengalis usually eat sitting on the floor with food served on a . They historically ate without silverware, with a large banana or plantain leaf serving as the plate, or with plates made from dried sal leaves sewn together.

It is customary to offer guests food and drink appropriate to the time of their visit. At meals, guests are served first, with the possible exception of very old or very young members of the host family. Within the family, serving starts with the senior males (those of highest social rank or eldest). School-age children are served before wives, daughter-in-laws, and the cook, who are the last to eat.

===Contemporary===
Prior to colonisation, adherence to meal order was a marker of social status, but with British and Portuguese influence and the growth of the middle class, this has slowly disappeared. Courses are frequently skipped or combined with everyday meals. Meals were usually served course by course to the diners by the youngest housewives, but increasing influence of nuclear families and urbanisation has replaced this. It is common to place everything on platters in the centre of the table, and each diner serves themselves. Ceremonial occasions such as weddings used to have elaborate serving rituals, but professional catering and buffet-style dining is now commonplace. However, large family occasions and more lavish ceremonial feasts may still abide by these rules.

==Meals==

Daily meals are usually simple, geared to balance nutrition and making extensive use of vegetables. The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier and go through various tastes and taste cleansers. Rice remains common throughout the meal and is the main constituent of the meal, until the &quot;chaţni&quot; (chutney) course.

===Main course===
==== Fish ====
Fish is a core part of the Bengali diet, and is the main source of protein. Bengalis typically use freshwater and brackish fish when making meals. Spices are used heavily in the preparation of fish, and the fish is usually served either as a curry or a fried steak. Popular fish curries include &quot;boal&quot;, &quot;rohu&quot;, &quot;ilish&quot;, and &quot;pabda&quot;.

One tradition includes the left side of the cidal fish being cooked in oil. Bengali Vaishnavas avoid all types of fish, eggs and meat.
====Sweets====
Bengali sweets have a long history. The Portuguese friar Sebastien Manrique, travelling in the region in the 17th century, noted the multitude of milk-based foods and sweets prepared in traditional ways. Falooda, shahi jilapi and shemai are popular sweet foods and desserts.

====Rasagulla====
Rasagulla, a Bengali traditional sweet, is one of the most widely consumed sweets in India. It spread to Bengal in 1868. Chhana based sweets were introduced in Eastern India from about the 18th century; as the process and technology involved in synthesizing &quot;Chhana&quot; was introduced to the Indians by the Dutch in the 1790s. The cottage cheese &quot;schmierkase&quot; was also known as Dutch cheese. The earlier versions of Rossogolla lacked binding capacity of the modern avatar that is well known and highly acclaimed today. This was due to the fact that the know-how involved in synthesizing such a sweet was unknown before being experimentally developed by Nobin Chandra Das and then constantly improved and further standardized by his successors. Furthermore, the &quot;chhana&quot; manufactured in those days was a coarse and granular variety and had low binding capacity. It was made by citric and ascorbic acid from natural fruit extracts. This type of &quot;chhana&quot; cannot be worked on to compact into any regular and firm shape for the purpose of sweet-making, leave alone making Rossogolla. This is because of a documented technological issue – lactic acid (extracted from whey) used to curdle milk now was introduced to India in the late 18th century by Dutch and Portuguese colonists (along with acetic acid). It is this method that creates the fine, smooth modern &quot;chhana&quot; with high binding capacity – which is now the staple raw material for Bengali confectioners. At present, Nobin Chandra Das is referred to have invented the spongy variant of rossogolla.

====Darbesh====
Laddu (or as it is known as &quot;darbesh&quot; in Bengal) is a very common sweet in West Bengal and Bangladesh, as well as the rest of the subcontinent, especially during celebrations and festivities. They are usually made out of flour, ghee/butter/oil and sugar. Alternative recipes can be made of coconut shavings and jaggery, raisins, chopped nuts, oatmeal, khoa, nutmeg, cardamom, or poppy seeds, among other ingredients. The sweet dates back to the year 4 BCE, where it was used for medicinal purposes and to keep the hormones of 9-11-year-old girls&#x27; hormones &quot;in check&quot;.

====Pantua====

&quot;Pantua&quot; is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.

====Other sweets====
Several varieties of &quot;doi&quot; such as &quot;mishţi doi&quot;, fruit-floured doi like &quot;aam doi&quot;, custards, and rice pudding (&quot;khir&quot; or &quot;firni&quot;) are also popular in West Bengal.

&quot;Shôndesh&quot;, &quot;chhanar jilapi&quot;, &quot;kalo jam&quot;, &quot;raghobshai&quot;, &quot;pantua&quot;, &quot;jolbhora shondesh&quot;, &quot;roshbhora&quot;, &quot;lord chomchom&quot;, &quot;payesh&quot;, &quot;bundiya&quot;, &quot;nalengurer shôndesh&quot;, &quot;malpoa&quot;, &quot;shor bhaja&quot;, &quot;langcha&quot;, &quot;babarsa&quot;, and a variety of others are examples of sweets in Bengali cuisine.

== Beverages ==
Common beverages include shorbot, lachhi, ghol, matha, falooda and Rooh Afza. The two main types of Bengali tea are dudh cha (milk tea) and masala cha. Srimangal, the tea capital of Bengal, is famed for the Seven Color Tea whilst Dhaka is famed for the borhani. Traditional fruit juices (&quot;rosh&quot;) are also drunk such as sugarcane juice, mango juice, palm fruit juice, date juice as well as basil seed or tukma-based drinks.

<text>Tropfest is the world&#x27;s largest short film festival. It has also become known as the world&#x27;s first global film festival.

Founded by actor/director John Polson, Tropfest began in 1993 as a screening for 200 people at the &#x27;Tropicana Caffe&#x27; in Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia, but has since become the largest platform for short films in the world. Tropfest Australia usually takes place in February each year in Sydney and it has been broadcast live via free-to-air television as well as global streaming and catch-up. Sydney Tropfest 2015 was cancelled less than a month before it was scheduled to run. After much support on social media, Tropfest founder Polson announced in early December 2015 that extra funding had been sourced, and the festival took place in Centennial Park on 14 February 2016. In August 2016 it was announced that from February 2017 Sydney&#x27;s Tropfest would be held in Parramatta Park.

While the festival has been on hiatus since 2019, Polson has stated that he is hopeful the festival will return. 

==Entry requirements==
Tropfest differs from other cinema events by being a &quot;content generation&quot; platform, rather than an exhibition platform. Filmmakers are required to create new works for the festival which must include an item, known as the &quot;Tropfest Signature Item&quot; (TSI) and which changes each year. The films must be less than 7 minutes (including titles and credits) and be world premieres at the Tropfest event.

==History==
The festival&#x27;s name is derived from the first year&#x27;s location—the Tropicana Caffe in Darlinghurst, an inner-eastern suburb of Sydney. Created by Australian-born filmmaker John Polson, the first festival was held in 1993 and was originally called the Tropicana Short Film Festival.

The support and involvement of film personalities from around the world has become one of the trademarks of the festival. Selection of the winning Tropfest film takes place live on the night of the festival by a panel of high-profile industry and celebrity judges, in addition to the previous year&#x27;s winner. Past judges have included Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, Naomi Watts, Toni Collette, Rose Byrne, Geoffrey Rush, Russell Crowe, John Woo, Samuel L. Jackson, Baz Luhrmann, Keanu Reeves, Sam Neill, Ewan McGregor, Jane Campion, Salma Hayek, George Miller, Susan Sarandon and Gabriel Byrne. Judges in 2018 included Eric Bana, Aaron Pedersen, Marta Dusseldorp, David Michôd, Jessica McNamee and Michele Bennett. Corporate supporters have included Intel, Sony, Qantas, Cointreau and MadFish Wines. Movie Extra used to be the primary sponsor of Tropfest Australia, which is now supported by Holden, Parramatta City Council, Screen Australia, Western Sydney University, Parramatta Park and Melrose Park.

The festival attracts wide media coverage but it is the casual, grassroots nature of the event, rather than its high profile, which ensures the continued support of its patrons and guests. Notable alumni include filmmakers and actors such as Alister Grierson, Rowan Woods, Clayton Jacobson, Alethea Jones, Joel Edgerton, Daina Reid, Nash Edgerton, Peter Carstairs, Rob Carlton, Rebel Wilson, Sam Worthington, Robert Connolly, Leon Ford, Justin Drape, Tim Bullock and Elissa Down.

Tropfest now includes the popular Trop Jr, a short filmmaking competition and festival for youngsters under 16.

Other Tropfest programs have included:

* APRA TROPSCORE, a film scoring and synching competition
* Nikon DSLR Film Category, a category in the competition awarding short films created using DSLR technology
* Holden 7 second Challenge, a 7-second film competition

==Locations==
The main event from 1993 to 2016 took place in Sydney but live satellite events have also been staged in Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth and other cities. The event has been broadcast live on television by ABC Comedy, Movie Network, SBS and other networks and webcast to viewers around Australia and the world. In August 2016 it was announced that, beginning in February 2017, the venue would be moved to Parramatta in western Sydney.

Tropfest has expanded to locations around the world including Japan, Turkey, Africa, Abu Dhabi, London, Berlin, Toronto, Bangkok, and New York City. The inaugural Tropfest Arabia, encompassing approximately 33 countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, took place in Abu Dhabi in November 2011. Tropfest launched into the United States in June 2012, with a weekend-long event in Las Vegas and a fully-fledged Tropfest New York competition in New York on 23 June 2012 at Manhattan&#x27;s Bryant Park. Tropfest New Zealand launched in 2013 and Tropfest South East Asia at Penang, Malaysia in 2014.

==Festival==

Each year there are hundreds and hundreds of entries featuring the TSI and every year 16 finalists are screened in public to a huge live audience in Sydney. Annual audiences of around 100,000 people in The Domain have been recorded, to watch the finalists on large video screens. With a television and on-line audience, this number swells to hundreds of thousands.

The Sydney screening of Tropfest 2006 was abandoned after 13 films due to severe electrical storms. Screenings in other cities were not affected. With the judges located in Sydney it was necessary to announce the winners two days later at a press conference.

Each film must be no longer than seven minutes, have never been shown publicly before and contain the &quot;Tropfest Signature Item&quot;, which changes each year, to show that the film was made specifically for the festival.

In April 2007, Tropfest formed a partnership with PBL Media which would see festival content archived and screened across various PBL properties and brands.

For Tropfest 2009, pay television channel Movie Extra replaced Sony as the naming rights sponsor for the next seven years. A new feature in 2009 was the live national broadcast of Tropfest and screening of the finalist films on the Movie Extra channel.

Tropfest Australia 2011 was the largest Tropfest ever staged, and reached a national audience of approximately 1,000,000 people (not including the internet).

Prior to the first full Tropfest New York competition in June 2012, Tropfest held annual New York screenings between 2006 and 2008. Signature items were a manhole cover, a slice, and a sunflower respectively. In November 2011, ahead of the 2012 competition, filmmakers were invited to &quot;grab a camera, start shooting and tell their story through film&quot;, using the Tropfest NY 2012 Signature Item of &quot;Bagel&quot;.

Over a weekend in June 2012, The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas celebrated Tropfest&#x27;s 20th anniversary, culminating in a screening of the best 16 films from the past two decades in the Tropfest All Star Competition. With judges Toni Collette (President of the Jury), Tobey Maguire, Rebel Wilson, James Woods, Anthony LaPaglia, Trevor Groth and Charles Randolph presiding over the competition, &quot;The Story of Bubble Boy&quot;, directed by Sean Ascroft, ultimately took the top prize.

A few weeks later, on 23 June 2012, Tropfest New York had its debut in Bryant Park. Hosted by Hugh Jackman and including musical performances by Alexi Murdoch and Milagres, the festival attracted a crowd of approximately 10,000. Judges Rose Byrne, Judah Friedlander, Jennifer Westfeldt, Scott Foundas and Ted Hope awarded the $20,000 first prize to director Josh Leake for his film &quot;Emptys&quot;. Tropfest NY 2013 festival was held on 22 June in Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park, with a bridge as the signature item. In 2014 Tropfest postponed its New York event. The festival planned a 2015 event, using a kiss as the signature item, which was originally announced for 2014.

Tropfest has one of the most successful channels on YouTube, having attracted more than 45,000,000 video views for its films in a relatively short time.

In February 2013 festival founder John Polson announced a change of date to 8 December and a change of venue from the Domain to Centennial Park. &quot;We feel like we are changing gears, we are growing every year and Centennial Park is in some ways the emotional heart of Sydney.&quot;

The winner of the December 2013 festival, &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, was accused of homophobia and transphobia. It is a comedy in which a man sleeps with a man he believes to be his transitioned ex-girlfriend.

==2015 cancellation==
On 11 November Polson announced that the 2015 Sydney Tropfest had been cancelled. He said &quot;... I have been made aware that the company contracted to raise the funding and administer the Tropfest event is unable to move forward for financial reasons.&quot; CEO of Tropfest Festival Productions, Michael Laverty, has been unavailable for comment.

===Financial difficulties===
Polsons said he had discovered to his &quot;surprise&quot; Tropfest was facing a financial crisis and could not proceed due to a lack of funds. It emerged the management company Polson had fallen out with over the alleged &quot;mismanagement&quot; of Tropfest funds was managed by Laverty, his long-time Tropfest partner and its managing director.

Over the following days it emerged suppliers and contracted partners of Tropfest had been experiencing payment delays for several months. As of 14 November Laverty was un-contactable for any comments. Commercial entertainment services agency The Intersection, which was retained in 2014 by Tropfest, issued a statement on Facebook stating its relationship with Tropfest ended in 2014 over a pay dispute.

An outpouring of support for Tropfest quickly appeared over social media, including Twitter and Facebook, with calls for generous benefactors, state or federal government support, or crowd-funding.

On 6 December Polson announced that the Sydney festival would be held in its intended venue, Centennial Park on 14 February 2016. CGU Insurance was the source of the necessary extra funding.

==Signature item==
Each year, Tropfest requires that entries include a particular &quot;signature item&quot; or action to ensure that they are unique and are made specifically for the festival. No TSI was required for the 1993 festival. The following are TSIs by year:
* 2019Candle

<text>Mid-stream operation is the operation of loading and unloading cargo containers at the container ship while at sea, with barges or dumb steel lighters performing the transfer, distribution or landing of containers to piers nearby.

Although mid-stream operation has the significant advantage of low costs, it has been criticized for its dangerous operation where cargoes are transferred between two ships on sea, which make it very difficult to operate.

==Hong Kong operations==
Mid-stream operation has been abandoned almost everywhere except Hong Kong, where land is insufficient and the fees for using the container pier are quite high. In Hong Kong, mid-stream operations occur at 12 different locations occupying a total land area of 34.6 hectares and water frontage of 3,513 metres.

Operators include:
* Fat Kee Stevedores Ltd.
* Tai Wah Sea/Land Heavy Transportation Ltd.
* Transward Ltd.

<doc id="519174" wikidata="Q2505921" url="?curid=519174" title="Premier (Canada)">
<text>In Canada, a premier ( ) is the head of government of a province or territory. Though the word is merely a synonym for &quot;prime minister&quot;, it is employed for provincial prime ministers to differentiate them from the prime minister of Canada. There are ten provincial premiers and three territorial premiers. In most provinces and all territories, these persons are styled &quot;the Honourable&quot; only while in office, unless they are admitted to the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, in which case they retain the title even after leaving the premiership. In Nova Scotia and Alberta, former premiers are honorary members of the provincial Executive Council and thereby retain the style &quot;the Honourable&quot; for life.

The prime minister–premier distinction does not exist in French, with both federal and provincial first ministers being styled (masculine) or (feminine).

==Name==

In a number of provinces, premiers were previously known by the title &quot;prime minister&quot;, with &quot;premier&quot; being an informal term used to apply to all prime ministers, even the prime minister of Canada. This practice was eventually phased out to avoid confusing the provincial leaders with the federal prime minister, as well as to indicate the distinct nature of the provincial offices. The last such case outside Quebec was that of W. A. C. Bennett, who served as premier of British Columbia and styled himself as &quot;prime minister&quot; until leaving office in 1972. The title &quot;premier&quot; is typically not granted by written law. The formal name of the government position held by the premier is &quot;president of the Executive Council&quot; or some similar term, but that formal term is rarely used.

The French language does not make a distinction between &quot;premier&quot;, &quot;prime minister&quot; and &quot;first minister&quot;, which are all rendered as &quot;&quot;. Thus, &quot;The prime minister of Canada and the premier of Ontario&quot; will be translated as &quot;&quot;.

The terms &quot;prime minister&quot; and &quot;premier&quot; come from the United Kingdom, where there is only one prime minister / premier. Heads of government of constituent countries in the UK are titled &quot;first minister&quot;. Collectively, Canada&#x27;s federal prime minister and the premiers are collectively referred to as &quot;first ministers&quot;, another synonym of British origin.

==Role==

Under Canada&#x27;s system of responsible government, the premier is both a member of the provincial legislative assembly and the head of the executive. The premier normally holds a seat in the legislative assembly, being elected in one of the electoral constituencies of the province. The leader of the party which commands a majority in the assembly is then legally appointed the premier by the lieutenant governor, representing the Canadian monarch in right of the province. While most often the leader of the largest party in a provincial or territorial legislature is invited to become premier, this is not always the case, the most recent exception occurring after the 2021 general election in Yukon.

Premiers advise the lieutenant governor on whom to appoint to the cabinet and they guide legislation through the legislature. Premiers thus exercise a significant amount of power within the Canadian federation, especially in regard to the federal government. In many ways they remain the most effective representatives of provincial interests to the federal government, as parliament&#x27;s strong party discipline and other factors have impaired provincial representation there. This reality is acknowledged in annual &quot;first ministers conferences&quot; in which the federal prime minister and the 10 premiers meet to discuss provincial-federal relations. The Meech Lake Accord proposed that these meetings be constitutionally mandated, and some premiers have even proposed that these meetings become a formal branch of government, active in the legislative process (see Council of the Federation). However, only one Canadian provincial premier has ever gone on to serve as prime minister: John Thompson. Canada&#x27;s first and sixth prime ministers (John A. Macdonald and Charles Tupper) had also been co-premier and premier of British provinces that became part of Canada, but no one who has led a victorious general election campaign in a Canadian province has ever been prime minister.

Canada&#x27;s three territories have premiers as well, though they are technically known as &quot;government leaders&quot;. The premier of Yukon is chosen in the usual fashion, but the premiers of Nunavut and Northwest Territories are selected from within the small and non-partisan elected territorial councils.

<text>The Sydney Film Festival is an annual competitive film festival held in Sydney, Australia, usually over 12 days in June. A number of awards are given, the top one being the Sydney Film Prize.

, the festival&#x27;s director is Nashen Moodley.

==History==
Influenced by the experience of Australian film makers with the Edinburgh Film Festival since 1947 and the festival connected with the annual meeting of the Australian Council of Film Societies held at Olinda in the Dandenong Ranges, Victoria in 1952, later Melbourne International Film Festival, a committee sprang from the Film Users Association of New South Wales to establish a film festival in Sydney. The committee included Alan Stout, Professor of Philosophy at The University of Sydney, filmmakers John Heyer and John Kingsford Smith, and Federation of Film Societies secretary David Donaldson. Under the direction of Donaldson, the inaugural festival opened on 11 June 1954 and was held over four days, with screenings at Sydney University. Attendance was at full capacity with 1,200 tickets sold at one guinea each.

By 1958, the festival attracted its first international sponsored guest, Paul Rotha, and advertising into the festival catalogue. The following year, the program expanded to seventeen days and by 1960 exceeded 2,000 subscribers with the introduction of the Opening Night feature film and party. Censorship difficulties arose in the mid-1960s and continued until such time as the festival was granted exemption from censorship in 1971.

From inception until 1967, the University remained the annual home of the festival. The following year, the festival moved to the Wintergarden in Rose Bay where it remained for the ensuing five years. The historic State Theatre became the home of the festival in 1974, and remains one of the festival venues to date. In 2007, the festival introduced a series of live gigs, shows and cabaret-style screening at the nearby Metro Theatre.

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the 2020 festival staged a reduced, online-only version, and in 2021 was delayed to open on 3 November with the audience limited first to 75 per cent capacity, increasing to 100 per cent from 8–21 November. The films were also available online.

==Description==
The competitive film festival draws international and local attention, with films being showcased in several venues across the city centre, and includes features, documentaries, short films, retrospectives, films for families and animations. Films are shown at venues across the Sydney CBD, with films shown at the Dendy Opera Quays, Event Cinemas in George Street, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Ritz Cinemas, Sydney Town Hall, the Museum of Contemporary Art as well as the State Theatre.

 the festival&#x27;s director is Nashen Moodley, who commenced in early 2012, replacing Clare Stewart.

Patrons of the festival include Gillian Armstrong, Cate Blanchett, Jane Campion, Nicole Kidman, Baz Luhrmann, George Miller, and Sam Neill among others.

==Competition and film prizes==
Although a small number of prizes existed from the mid–1980s, prior to 2007, the Sydney Film Festival was classified by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF) as a Non-Competitive Feature Film Festival. On 10 September 2007, the Festival announced it had received funding from the New South Wales Government to host an official international competition, which rewarded &quot;new directions in film&quot;. The FIAFP has since classified the Sydney Film Festival as a Competitive Specialised Feature Film Festival.

<doc id="519181" wikidata="Q3572631" url="?curid=519181" title="Yori Boy Campas">
<text>Luis Ramón &quot;Yori Boy&quot; Campas Medina (born August 6, 1971) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1987 to 2019. He held the IBF light middleweight title from 1997 to 1998.

==Background==
He is a native of Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico, where the word &quot;Yori&quot; means white. When he was young and he walked into a gym for the first time, the way he hit opponents that day impressed his trainers, Chava Mendoza and Gilbert Marquez. He began to be nicknamed &quot;Yori Boy&quot;, and few actually know his real name is Luis Ramon. He trained in Three Forks, Montana, with his manager and trainer, Joe Diaz.

==Professional career==
Campas, whose brother Armando was also a respected professional fighter, began his professional career on July 7, 1987 at the age of fifteen, by knocking out Gaby Vega in the first round at Ciudad Obregón, Sonora. His first thirteen fights were all won by knockout, and he built a record of 56-0 with 50 knockout wins by the time the IBF had him ranked as their number one world title challenger. Prior to that, he had won the Mexican and regional NABF welterweight titles. He won the NABF one on his first fight abroad, defeating Roger Turner by a twelve-round decision in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 19, 1992.

===Title: Fight against Trinidad===
Campas also beat former world champion Jorge Vaca by a knockout in round two in Tijuana before getting his first world title fight on September 17, 1994 against Félix Trinidad for the IBF welterweight title as part of a Pay Per View undercard that featured Julio César Chávez&#x27;s rematch against Meldrick Taylor for the WBC light welterweight title. Campas, who had been considered by many Mexicans to be &quot;the next Chávez&quot;, dropped Trinidad in round two, but he lost by a fourth-round technical knockout for his first professional defeat in 57 bouts.

Campas came back with seven straight wins, including one that gave him the WBO&#x27;s regional NABO welterweight title, when he knocked out former world champion Genaro Leon in three rounds on August 7, 1995. On September 6, 1996, he was given a second world title try, against José Luis Lopez, for the WBO welterweight title, in Los Angeles, California. Campas lost by knockout in round six.

===Capturing a World Title===
Campas then decided to campaign in the light middleweight division, beating Fidel Avendano by a knockout in round two in his first fight there. Campas had four straight wins before challenging for a world title again, this time against IBF light middleweight champion Raul Marquez. On December 6, 1997, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Campas became the world champion by knocking out Marquez in round eight. He defended his title three times, beating Anthony Stephens by a knockout in three at Ledyard, Connecticut; Pedro Ortega by a technical knockout in eleven at Tijuana; and former Trinidad opponent Larry Barnes by a knockout in three in Las Vegas. On December 12, 1998, however, he lost the title after retiring in his corner in the seventh round against Fernando Vargas in Las Vegas.

After two wins in a row, he lost to Oba Carr. For his next fight, however, he became the first boxer to beat Tony Ayala when Ayala was knocked out in round eight by Campas in San Antonio, Texas. On March 16, 2002, he received his next world title shot, for the vacant WBO light middleweight title, against Puerto Rico&#x27;s Daniel Santos, once again in Las Vegas. He lost by knockout in round eleven.

After one more knockout win, he tried to gain the WBC and WBA light middleweight titles against Oscar De La Hoya on May 3, 2003, again in Las Vegas. He lost that fight by knockout in round seven.

During a press conference held in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 24, 2004, Campas announced he had moved to that city. Two days later, he returned to the ring after a ten-month layoff, defeating Dumont Dewey Welliver by a ten-round split decision. He followed his win over Welliver with an eight-round decision win over Raul Munoz, also in Phoenix. Campas then suffered a mild upset when he was beaten by the relatively unknown Eric Regan by decision in twelve rounds at Oroville, California.

His 2006 fight against Ireland&#x27;s John Duddy was a candidate for the 2006 Fight of the Year.

===100th career victory===
On 30 March 2012, Campas reached a significant milestone when he chalked up the 100th win of his career via a 2nd-round knockout of Mauro Lucero. The win gave Campas his 79th win inside the distance and improved his overall record to 100-16-1.

<doc id="519182" wikidata="Q519967" url="?curid=519182" title="Projection (linear algebra)">
<text>In linear algebra and functional analysis, a projection is a linear transformation formula_1 from a vector space to itself (an endomorphism) such that formula_2. That is, whenever formula_1 is applied twice to any vector, it gives the same result as if it were applied once (i.e. formula_1 is idempotent). It leaves its image unchanged. This definition of &quot;projection&quot; formalizes and generalizes the idea of graphical projection. One can also consider the effect of a projection on a geometrical object by examining the effect of the projection on points in the object.

==Definitions==
A projection on a vector space formula_5 is a linear operator formula_6 such that formula_7.

When formula_5 has an inner product and is complete, i.e. when formula_5 is a Hilbert space, the concept of orthogonality can be used. A projection formula_1 on a Hilbert space formula_5 is called an orthogonal projection if it satisfies formula_12 for all formula_13. A projection on a Hilbert space that is not orthogonal is called an oblique projection.

===Projection matrix===
* A square matrix formula_1 is called a projection matrix if it is equal to its square, i.e. if formula_7.
* A square matrix formula_1 is called an orthogonal projection matrix if formula_17 for a real matrix, and respectively formula_18 for a complex matrix, where formula_19 denotes the transpose of formula_1 and formula_21 denotes the adjoint or Hermitian transpose of formula_1.
* A projection matrix that is not an orthogonal projection matrix is called an oblique projection matrix.
The eigenvalues of a projection matrix must be 0 or 1.

==Examples==
===Orthogonal projection===
For example, the function which maps the point formula_23 in three-dimensional space formula_24 to the point formula_25 is an orthogonal projection onto the &quot;xy&quot;-plane. This function is represented by the matrix
formula_26

The action of this matrix on an arbitrary vector is
formula_27

To see that formula_1 is indeed a projection, i.e., formula_29, we compute
formula_30

Observing that formula_31 shows that the projection is an orthogonal projection.

===Oblique projection===
A simple example of a non-orthogonal (oblique) projection is
formula_32

Via matrix multiplication, one sees that
formula_33
showing that formula_1 is indeed a projection.

The projection formula_1 is orthogonal if and only if formula_36 because only then formula_37

== Properties and classification ==
===Idempotence===
By definition, a projection formula_1 is idempotent (i.e. formula_7).

===Open map===
Every projection is an open map onto its image, meaning that it maps each open set in the domain to an open set in the subspace topology of the image. That is, for any vector formula_40 and any ball formula_41 (with positive radius) centered on formula_40, there exists a ball formula_43 (with positive radius) centered on formula_44 that is wholly contained in the image formula_45.

===Complementarity of image and kernel===
Let formula_46 be a finite-dimensional vector space and formula_1 be a projection on formula_46. Suppose the subspaces formula_49 and formula_5 are the image and kernel of formula_1 respectively. Then formula_1 has the following properties:

# formula_1 is the identity operator formula_54 on formula_49: formula_56
# We have a direct sum formula_57. Every vector formula_58 may be decomposed uniquely as formula_59 with formula_60 and formula_61, and where formula_62

The image and kernel of a projection are &quot;complementary&quot;, as are formula_1 and formula_64. The operator formula_65 is also a projection as the image and kernel of formula_1 become the kernel and image of formula_65 and vice versa. We say formula_1 is a projection along formula_5 onto formula_49 (kernel/image) and formula_65 is a projection along formula_49 onto formula_5.

===Spectrum===
In infinite-dimensional vector spaces, the spectrum of a projection is contained in formula_74 as
formula_75
Only 0 or 1 can be an eigenvalue of a projection. This implies that an orthogonal projection formula_1 is always a positive semi-definite matrix. In general, the corresponding eigenspaces are (respectively) the kernel and range of the projection. Decomposition of a vector space into direct sums is not unique. Therefore, given a subspace formula_5, there may be many projections whose range (or kernel) is formula_5.

If a projection is nontrivial it has minimal polynomial formula_79, which factors into distinct linear factors, and thus formula_1 is diagonalizable.

===Product of projections===
The product of projections is not in general a projection, even if they are orthogonal. If two projections commute then their product is a projection, but the converse is false: the product of two non-commuting projections may be a projection. 

If two orthogonal projections commute then their product is an orthogonal projection. If the product of two orthogonal projections is an orthogonal projection, then the two orthogonal projections commute (more generally: two self-adjoint endomorphisms commute if and only if their product is self-adjoint).

===Orthogonal projections===
When the vector space formula_46 has an inner product and is complete (is a Hilbert space) the concept of orthogonality can be used. An orthogonal projection is a projection for which the range formula_49 and the kernel formula_5 are orthogonal subspaces. Thus, for every formula_84 and formula_85 in formula_46, formula_87. Equivalently:
formula_88

A projection is orthogonal if and only if it is self-adjoint. Using the self-adjoint and idempotent properties of formula_1, for any formula_84 and formula_85 in formula_46 we have formula_93, formula_94, and
formula_95
where formula_96 is the inner product associated with formula_46. Therefore, formula_98 and formula_99 are orthogonal projections. The other direction, namely that if formula_1 is orthogonal then it is self-adjoint, follows from the implication from formula_101 to
formula_102
for every formula_103 and formula_104 in formula_46; thus formula_106.

The existence of an orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace follows from the Hilbert projection theorem.

====Properties and special cases====
An orthogonal projection is a bounded operator. This is because for every formula_107 in the vector space we have, by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:
formula_108
Thus formula_109.

For finite-dimensional complex or real vector spaces, the standard inner product can be substituted for formula_96.

=====Formulas=====
A simple case occurs when the orthogonal projection is onto a line. If formula_111 is a unit vector on the line, then the projection is given by the outer product
formula_112
(If formula_111 is complex-valued, the transpose in the above equation is replaced by a Hermitian transpose). This operator leaves u invariant, and it annihilates all vectors orthogonal to formula_111, proving that it is indeed the orthogonal projection onto the line containing u. A simple way to see this is to consider an arbitrary vector formula_84 as the sum of a component on the line (i.e. the projected vector we seek) and another perpendicular to it, formula_116. Applying projection, we get
formula_117
by the properties of the dot product of parallel and perpendicular vectors.

This formula can be generalized to orthogonal projections on a subspace of arbitrary dimension. Let formula_118 be an orthonormal basis of the subspace formula_49, with the assumption that the integer formula_120, and let formula_121 denote the formula_122 matrix whose columns are formula_118, i.e., formula_124. Then the projection is given by:
formula_125
which can be rewritten as
formula_126

The matrix formula_127 is the partial isometry that vanishes on the orthogonal complement of formula_49, and formula_121 is the isometry that embeds formula_49 into the underlying vector space. The range of formula_131 is therefore the &quot;final space&quot; of formula_121. It is also clear that formula_133 is the identity operator on formula_49.

The orthonormality condition can also be dropped. If formula_118 is a (not necessarily orthonormal) basis with formula_120, and formula_121 is the matrix with these vectors as columns, then the projection is:
formula_138

The matrix formula_121 still embeds formula_49 into the underlying vector space but is no longer an isometry in general. The matrix formula_141 is a &quot;normalizing factor&quot; that recovers the norm. For example, the rank-1 operator formula_142 is not a projection if formula_143 After dividing by formula_144 we obtain the projection formula_145 onto the subspace spanned by formula_146.

In the general case, we can have an arbitrary positive definite matrix formula_147 defining an inner product formula_148, and the projection formula_131 is given by formula_150. Then
formula_151

When the range space of the projection is generated by a frame (i.e. the number of generators is greater than its dimension), the formula for the projection takes the form: formula_152. Here formula_153 stands for the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. This is just one of many ways to construct the projection operator.

If formula_154 is a non-singular matrix and formula_155 (i.e., formula_156 is the null space matrix of formula_121), the following holds: 
formula_158

If the orthogonal condition is enhanced to formula_159 with formula_46 non-singular, the following holds:
formula_161

All these formulas also hold for complex inner product spaces, provided that the conjugate transpose is used instead of the transpose. Further details on sums of projectors can be found in Banerjee and Roy (2014). Also see Banerjee (2004) for application of sums of projectors in basic spherical trigonometry.

=== Oblique projections ===
The term &quot;oblique projections&quot; is sometimes used to refer to non-orthogonal projections. These projections are also used to represent spatial figures in two-dimensional drawings (see oblique projection), though not as frequently as orthogonal projections. Whereas calculating the fitted value of an ordinary least squares regression requires an orthogonal projection, calculating the fitted value of an instrumental variables regression requires an oblique projection.

A projection is defined by its kernel and the basis vectors used to characterize its range (which is a complement of the kernel). When these basis vectors are orthogonal to the kernel, then the projection is an orthogonal projection. When these basis vectors are not orthogonal to the kernel, the projection is an oblique projection, or just a projection. 

==== A matrix representation formula for a nonzero projection operator ====
Let formula_162 be a linear operator such that formula_7 and assume that formula_1 is not the zero operator. Let the vectors formula_118 form a basis for the range of formula_1, and assemble these vectors in the formula_122 matrix formula_121. Then formula_120, otherwise formula_170 and formula_1 is the zero operator. The range and the kernel are complementary spaces, so the kernel has dimension formula_172. It follows that the orthogonal complement of the kernel has dimension formula_173. Let formula_174 form a basis for the orthogonal complement of the kernel of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the matrix formula_156. Then the projection formula_1 (with the condition formula_120) is given by
formula_178

This expression generalizes the formula for orthogonal projections given above. A standard proof of this expression is the following. For any vector formula_84 in the vector space formula_5, we can decompose formula_181, where vector formula_182 is in the image of formula_1, and vector formula_184 So formula_185, and then formula_186 is in the kernel of formula_1, which is the null space of formula_188 In other words, the vector formula_189 is in the column space of formula_190 so formula_191 for some formula_173 dimension vector formula_193 and the vector formula_186 satisfies formula_195 by the construction of formula_156. Put these conditions together, and we find a vector formula_193 so that formula_198. Since matrices formula_121 and formula_156 are of full rank formula_173 by their construction, the formula_202-matrix formula_203 is invertible. So the equation formula_198 gives the vector formula_205 In this way, formula_206 for any vector formula_207 and hence formula_208.

In the case that formula_1 is an orthogonal projection, we can take formula_210, and it follows that formula_211. By using this formula, one can easily check that formula_212. In general, if the vector space is over complex number field, one then uses the Hermitian transpose formula_213 and has the formula formula_214. Recall that one can express the Moore–Penrose inverse of the matrix formula_121 by formula_216 since formula_121 has full column rank, so formula_218.

==== Singular values ====
formula_219 is also an oblique projection. The singular values of formula_1 and formula_219 can be computed by an orthonormal basis of formula_121. Let 
formula_223 be an orthonormal basis of formula_121 and let formula_225 be the orthogonal complement of formula_223. Denote the singular values of the matrix
formula_227 by the positive values formula_228. With this, the singular values for formula_1 are: 
formula_230
and the singular values for formula_219 are
formula_232
This implies that the largest singular values of formula_1 and formula_219 are equal, and thus that the matrix norm of the oblique projections are the same. However, the condition number satisfies the relation formula_235, and is therefore not necessarily equal.

===Finding projection with an inner product===
Let formula_5 be a vector space (in this case a plane) spanned by orthogonal vectors formula_237. Let formula_104 be a vector. One can define a projection of formula_85 onto formula_5 as
formula_241
where repeated indices are summed over (Einstein sum notation). The vector formula_85 can be written as an orthogonal sum such that formula_243. formula_244 is sometimes denoted as formula_245. There is a theorem in linear algebra that states that this formula_246 is the smallest distance (the &quot;orthogonal distance&quot;) from formula_85 to formula_5 and is commonly used in areas such as machine learning.

== Canonical forms ==

Any projection formula_249 on a vector space of dimension formula_250 over a field is a diagonalizable matrix, since its minimal polynomial divides formula_251, which splits into distinct linear factors. Thus there exists a basis in which formula_1 has the form
:formula_253
where formula_254 is the rank of formula_1. Here formula_256 is the identity matrix of size formula_254, formula_258 is the zero matrix of size formula_259, and formula_260 is the direct sum operator. If the vector space is complex and equipped with an inner product, then there is an &quot;orthonormal&quot; basis in which the matrix of &quot;P&quot; is

:formula_261

where formula_262. The integers formula_263 and the real numbers formula_264 are uniquely determined. formula_265. The factor formula_266 corresponds to the maximal invariant subspace on which formula_1 acts as an &quot;orthogonal&quot; projection (so that &quot;P&quot; itself is orthogonal if and only if formula_268) and the formula_264-blocks correspond to the &quot;oblique&quot; components.

== Projections on normed vector spaces ==

When the underlying vector space formula_270 is a (not necessarily finite-dimensional) normed vector space, analytic questions, irrelevant in the finite-dimensional case, need to be considered. Assume now formula_270 is a Banach space.

Many of the algebraic results discussed above survive the passage to this context. A given direct sum decomposition of formula_270 into complementary subspaces still specifies a projection, and vice versa. If formula_270 is the direct sum formula_274, then the operator defined by formula_275 is still a projection with range formula_49 and kernel formula_5. It is also clear that formula_7. Conversely, if formula_1 is projection on formula_270, i.e. formula_7, then it is easily verified that formula_282. In other words, formula_283 is also a projection. The relation formula_7 implies formula_285 and formula_270 is the direct sum formula_287.

However, in contrast to the finite-dimensional case, projections need not be continuous in general. If a subspace formula_49 of formula_270 is not closed in the norm topology, then the projection onto formula_49 is not continuous. In other words, the range of a continuous projection formula_1 must be a closed subspace. Furthermore, the kernel of a continuous projection (in fact, a continuous linear operator in general) is closed. Thus a &quot;continuous&quot; projection formula_1 gives a decomposition of formula_270 into two complementary &quot;closed&quot; subspaces: formula_294.

The converse holds also, with an additional assumption. Suppose formula_49 is a closed subspace of formula_270. If there exists a closed subspace formula_5 such that , then the projection formula_1 with range formula_49 and kernel formula_5 is continuous. This follows from the closed graph theorem. Suppose and . One needs to show that formula_301. Since formula_49 is closed and , &quot;y&quot; lies in formula_49, i.e. . Also, . Because formula_5 is closed and , we have formula_305, i.e. formula_306, which proves the claim.

The above argument makes use of the assumption that both formula_49 and formula_5 are closed. In general, given a closed subspace formula_49, there need not exist a complementary closed subspace formula_5, although for Hilbert spaces this can always be done by taking the orthogonal complement. For Banach spaces, a one-dimensional subspace always has a closed complementary subspace. This is an immediate consequence of Hahn–Banach theorem. Let formula_49 be the linear span of formula_146. By Hahn–Banach, there exists a bounded linear functional formula_313 such that . The operator formula_314 satisfies formula_315, i.e. it is a projection. Boundedness of formula_313 implies continuity of formula_1 and therefore formula_318 is a closed complementary subspace of formula_49.

== Applications and further considerations ==

Projections (orthogonal and otherwise) play a major role in algorithms for certain linear algebra problems:
* QR decomposition (see Householder transformation and Gram–Schmidt decomposition);
* Singular value decomposition
* Reduction to Hessenberg form (the first step in many eigenvalue algorithms)
* Linear regression
* Projective elements of matrix algebras are used in the construction of certain K-groups in Operator K-theory

As stated above, projections are a special case of idempotents. Analytically, orthogonal projections are non-commutative generalizations of characteristic functions. Idempotents are used in classifying, for instance, semisimple algebras, while measure theory begins with considering characteristic functions of measurable sets. Therefore, as one can imagine, projections are very often encountered in the context of operator algebras. In particular, a von Neumann algebra is generated by its complete lattice of projections.

== Generalizations ==
More generally, given a map between normed vector spaces formula_320 one can analogously ask for this map to be an isometry on the orthogonal complement of the kernel: that formula_321 be an isometry (compare Partial isometry); in particular it must be onto. The case of an orthogonal projection is when &quot;W&quot; is a subspace of &quot;V.&quot; In Riemannian geometry, this is used in the definition of a Riemannian submersion.

<text>The Shebelle River (Oromo: Laga Shabeellee, , , ) also known historically as the Nile of Mogadishu, begins in the highlands of Ethiopia, and then flows southeast into Somalia towards Mogadishu. Near Mogadishu, it turns sharply southwest, where it follows the coast. Below Mogadishu, the river becomes seasonal. During most years, the river dries up near the mouth of the Jubba River, while in seasons of heavy rainfall, the river actually reaches the Jubba and thus the ocean.

During periods of heavy rainfall in Ethiopia, the Shebelle River and the Jubba River merge, and their combined waters ultimately reach the Indian Ocean. However, in drier years, the Shebelle River diminishes and transforms into a series of wetlands and sandy plains to the northeast of the confluence with the Jubba. The Shebelle River has a total length of 1,820 km. The area surrounding the Shebeli River is inhabited by Somali people in the Somali Region of Ethiopia and Somali people in Somalia. In the lower basin of the river, agriculture has largely replaced the traditional nomadic herding lifestyle, and the cultivation of bananas along the southern stretches of the Shebeli and Jubba rivers contributes significantly to Somalia&#x27;s export industry.

==Tributaries==
The Shebelle has a number of tributaries, both seasonal and permanent rivers. They include:
* Erer River
* Galetti River
* Wabe River

The Fafen only reaches the Shebelle in times of heavy rainfall; its stream usually ends before reaching the main river.

==History==

===Ajuran Empire===

During the middle ages, the Shebelle river was under the control of the Ajuran Empire and was largely utilized for its plantations. Coming into prominence during the 13th century AD, the Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers. Through hydraulic engineering, they also constructed many of the limestone wells and cisterns of the state many of which are still in use today. Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.

Through their control of the region&#x27;s wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as they were the only hydraulic empire in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali and Oromo nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long-distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.

With the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in Afgooye, Bardhere and other areas in the Jubba and Shabelle rivers increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as &quot;Kelliyo&quot; fed directly from the Shebelle River and Jubba rivers into the plantations where sorghum, maize, beans, grain and cotton were grown during the &quot;gu&quot; (Spring in Somali) and &quot;xagaa&quot; (Summer in Somali) seasons of the Somali calendar. This irrigation system was supported by numerous dikes and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with &quot;moos&quot;, &quot;taraab&quot; and &quot;guldeed&quot; being the terms used.

The urban centers of Mogadishu, Merca, Barawa, Kismayo and Hobyo and other respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the state. The Somali farming communities of the hinterland from Jubba and Shebelle rivers brought their crops to the Somali coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia, Persia, India, Venice, Egypt, Portugal, and as far away as Java and China.

===Modern period===

According to Thomas Wakefield, who visited the region, the river was also known as the &quot;Adari River&quot;. The source of the Shebelle River is cultivated by the Arsi Oromo, Sidamo and mostly Somalis, respectively. It is surrounded by a sacred enclosure wooded with juniper trees, which as of 1951 was under the protection of a Muslim member of the Arsi.

In 1989, with the help of Soviet engineers, the Melka Wakena dam was built on the upper reaches of the Shebelle River in the Bale Mountains. Producing 153 megawatts, this dam is Ethiopia’s largest hydroelectric generator.

The recent history of the Shabelle is marked by frequent destructive flash floods. The Shabelle is said to have flooded every other year prior to the 1960s; that decade had only two devastating floods, the &quot;hidigsayley&quot; in 1965, and the &quot;soogudud&quot; in 1966. In the 1970s, the most devastating flood was the &quot;kabahay&quot; of 1978. In 1996, floods devastated three woredas in Ethiopia. On 23 October 1999, the river unexpectedly flooded in the middle of the night, destroying homes and crops in 14 out of the 117 kebeles in Kelafo woreda, as well as 29 of the 46 kebeles in neighboring Mustahil woreda. According to the local authorities, 34 people and an estimated 750 livestock died, with 70,000 affected by the floods and in need of assistance. Two more recent floods were the &quot;dawdle&quot; in 2003, when about 100 livestock and 119 people were washed away, and the flood of April 2005, when about 30,000 persons were surrounded by floodwaters and 2,000 camels and 4,000 shoats were washed away by the floods; some locals consider this the worst flood in 40 years.

<text>The XX Corps was an army corps of the British Army during World War I.

==First World War==
The Corps was formed in Palestine in June 1917 under Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode. Following the British failure in the Second Battle of Gaza, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force underwent a major rearrangement with the appointment of General Edmund Allenby as the new Commander-in-Chief. The infantry component of the force was divided into two corps; XX Corps and XXI Corps.

The corps initially comprised four infantry divisions:

* 10th (Irish) Division
* 53rd (Welsh) Division
* 60th (2/2nd London) Division
* 74th (Yeomanry) Division

The XX Corps first saw action in the Beersheba phase of the Third Battle of Gaza on 31 October 1917. The 60th and 74th Divisions captured Turkish outposts west of the town but were not involved in the final assault. Following Beersheba on 6 November, the corps made a frontal assault against the Turkish fortifications in the vicinity of Sheria where the 10th, 60th and 74th Divisions succeeded in breaking through. The 10th Division captured the Hareira Redoubt on 7 November and the 60th Division advanced on Huj in support of the Australian Mounted Division&#x27;s effort to cut off the retreating Turkish army.

During the Battle of Megiddo the formation was:

* Corps Troops
* 10th (Irish) Division
* 53rd (Welsh) Division

==General officers commanding==
Commanders included:
* 2 August – 20 August 1917 Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Chetwode
* 20 August – 31 August 1917 Major-General John Shea (acting)
* 31 August 1917 – November 1918 Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Chetwode

<doc id="519186" wikidata="Q1771871" url="?curid=519186" title="Gun Owners of America">
<text>Gun Owners of America (GOA) is a gun rights organization in the United States. It makes efforts to differentiate itself from the larger National Rifle Association (NRA) and has publicly criticized the NRA on multiple occasions for what it considers to be compromising on gun rights.

The GOA was outspoken in opposing John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential bid, describing his gun-rights voting record as &quot;abysmal, wretched, and pathetic&quot; and giving him an F− grade on Second Amendment issues since 2004, while the NRA (through its political action committee, the NRA-PVF) gave him a C+.

The GOA has been described by Congressman Ron Paul as &quot;The only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington.&quot; This quote from Paul is displayed on the home page of the Gun Owners of America website. Paul was the only 2008 presidential candidate to receive an A+ grade from Gun Owners of America.

==History==
Gun Owners of America (GOA) was founded in 1976 by California state senator H. L. Richardson. The GOA lobbies both state and federal legislatures to promote Second Amendment rights. Richardson was chairman of Gun Owners of America until he retired in 2017. Tim Macy, who had been on the board since the organization’s founding, then became chairman.

Tim Macy is president and chairman of the Board of Gun Owners of America. He has been on the Board of Directors for over 35 years since the inception of GOA. Macy is involved with GOA’s sister organization as well. Serving on the boards of Gun Owners Foundation, Gun Owners of America’s Political Victory Fund and Gun Owners of California.

John Velleco serves as the executive vice president. He previously served as the director of federal affairs for the organization.

Erich Pratt is the senior vice president for GOA, having worked in gun politics for over three decades. Erich served under several titles at GOA – from federal and state directors to communications director for the organization. He now serves as the chief national spokesman and focuses on policy for both the federal and state levels of government.

Sam Paredes is a board member of GOA and currently serves as the executive director for GOA’s sister organization, Gun Owners of California. Paredes is a certified firearms instructor.

==Activities==

Gun Owners of America is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization. According to Gun Owners of America&#x27;s website, its board contends that Americans have lost some of their gun rights, and GOA strives to get them back.

By its own account, Gun Owners of America spent over $1.75 million lobbying Congress in 2004, and over $18 million between 1998 and 2004. Gun Owners of America&#x27;s Federal Political Action Committee is &quot;Gun Owners of America Inc. Political Victory Fund&quot; (C00278101). It raises funds to support the election of pro-gun candidates at all levels of government.

Gun Owners Foundation is an educational nonprofit foundation. It acts as the research arm for GOA. Its main objective is to hold seminars around the country to inform the public, media outlets, and various government officials on Second Amendment issues. The Gun Owners Foundation around 2008 began a new campaign by creating Public Service Announcements to promote what it calls &quot;PROPER Gun Safety&quot;. According to Gun Owners Foundation, its campaign objective is &quot;to generate public awareness of the dangers of not having a gun ready for protection and to encourage gun owners not to lock up their best means of self-defense&quot;.

==GOA victories==
On July 13, 2006, Senator David Vitter saw an 84–16 vote for his amendment prohibiting the use of federal money for federal agents to confiscate weapons during a declared state of emergency.

On June 27, 2007, the Pence Amendment passed. The bill, named after then-representative and future vice president Mike Pence, was passed by a vote of 309–115. According to Gun Owners of America, the amendment blocked the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s ability to use the Fairness Doctrine to limit the free speech allowed by organizations like Gun Owners of America over the airwaves.

On August 9, 2007, Gun Owners of America supported Vitter&#x27;s work in pushing through a bill stating that no U.S. funds can be used by the United Nations or any group affiliated with the United Nations to restrict or tax Second Amendment rights. If they attempt to do so, the U.S. can withdraw their funds from the organization. This bill, HR-2764, also known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, passed by an 81–10 vote.

On February 25, 2008, Senator Jim DeMint amended bill S-1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The act stated that the funds were to be used for &quot;violence prevention&quot;. Once the funds were attempted to be used for gun buybacks, DeMint pushed through an amendment to the act stating that the money cannot be used for any anti-gun programs. DeMint&#x27;s amendment passed by a margin of 78–11.

2010, GOA campaigns for and helps pass the Firearms Freedom Act laws across the country including Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.

<doc id="519193" wikidata="Q3277000" url="?curid=519193" title="List of birds of Sri Lanka">
<text>Sri Lanka is a tropical island situated close to the southern tip of India. The bird life of Sri Lanka is very rich for its size and more than 500 species have been recorded. In addition to the many resident birds, a considerable number of migratory species winter in the country to escape their northern breeding grounds.

35 species are confirmed as endemic, the latest addition being the Sri Lanka shama, which previously considered as a subspecies of the white-rumped shama. The other resident species are also found in the nearby Indian mainland, but over 80 have developed distinct Sri Lankan races. Some of these races are very different in their plumage characteristics from the related forms in India. 26 species are globally threatened.

Bird distribution in Sri Lanka is largely determined by its climatic zones. The dry zone is largest of the three, covering more than half of the island, with a prolonged dry and hot period and only one monsoon (the north east monsoon from October to January).

The wet zone, with two monsoons, is in the south western quarter of the island, where the few remaining rain forests are found and humidity is high.

The central hill zone rises to over 2450 m (8-10,000 ft) and has a cool temperate climate. Most of the 34 endemic species are confined to the wet and the hill zones, with only a few extending into the dry zone as well.

Recent updates and sighting information can be obtained through the Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka website. The following list is prepared according to &quot;An Illustrated Guide to the Birds of Sri Lanka&quot; on 2010 by Sarath Kotagama and Gamini Ratnavira. Supplemental updates and taxonomy follow &quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot;, 2022 edition.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

* (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Sri Lanka
* (E) Endemic - a species native or restricted to Sri Lanka
* (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Sri Lanka as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl==
Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae

The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.

<doc id="519197" wikidata="Q2485615" url="?curid=519197" title="Barranquitas, Puerto Rico">
<text>Barranquitas (, ) is a small mountain town and municipality located in the Cordillera Central region of Puerto Rico, south of Corozal and Naranjito; north of Coamo and Aibonito; west of Comerío and Cidra; and east of Orocovis. Barranquitas is spread over 6 barrios and Barranquitas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Barranquitas is about one hour by winding roads from San Juan, the capital. It is nestled amid hills and mountains, and nearby, between Barranquitas and Aibonito, is the San Cristóbal Canyon; one of the deepest canyons in the West Indies. For years, the overlook was used as a municipal garbage; in the last decade, the refuse was removed and the site restored.

==History==

Barranquitas&#x27;s local Taino Cacique was called Orocobix.

The town was founded in 1803 by Antonio Aponte Ramos.
Early in the 20th century, Barranquitas residents, known as &quot;Barranquiteños&quot;, had a short but legendary territory war with residents of the city of Comerío.

In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Barranquitas was 8,103.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Barranquitas with its significant amount of rainfall and its nearly category 5 winds. Many residents did not receive help for weeks after the hurricane made landfall as entry into the municipality was hampered by downed trees and telephone poles, landslides, and highways that had split in two.

In Barranquitas, up to 1000 homes, and its highways were destroyed by landslides. Forty days after the hurricane, none of Barranquitas&#x27; 29,000 residents had their electrical power restored. Barranquitas&#x27; agriculture industry was decimated with one farmer saying he&#x27;d lost his five thousand plantain trees, apio, and other minor crops.

Scenes around Barranquitas after Hurricane María:

<doc id="519199" wikidata="Q7142702" url="?curid=519199" title="Passion (Jennifer Rush album)">
<text>Passion is the fourth studio album by American singer Jennifer Rush, released in September 1988.

==Background==
Following on from the success of her previous album &quot;Heart over Mind&quot;, Rush continued working with much of the same team of writers and producers. She returned to working with Harold Faltermeyer as producer on four of the album&#x27;s songs because she felt they understood each other well. Notable tracks on this album include &quot;Same Heart&quot; - a duet with Michael Bolton (although this came a year before his international breakthrough), and &quot;Remind My Heart&quot; which is a collaboration with producer Jellybean Benitez who was then at the peak of his fame.

Sales were satisfying in her most successful market, Germany, where the album reached No.3 and was certified platinum. The album had 340,000 pre-release orders in Germany, the largest ever ship-out for an album released by CBS records at the time. CBS used a &quot;concentrated retail campaign&quot; for the album and its lead single &quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only&quot;.

The album did not enter the albums chart in the United Kingdom but single success did come a few months later in the UK, when a duet with Plácido Domingo, &quot;Till I Loved You&quot;, became a hit in the summer of 1989. The record company however failed to capitalise on this by not repromoting the album.

==Singles==
&quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only&quot;, &quot;Keep All the Fires Burning Bright&quot; and &quot;Love Get Ready&quot; were released as singles to promote the album.

&quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only&quot; entered several singles charts in Europe, reaching 21 in Switzerland, 27 in West Germany and 90 in the United Kingdom.

The second single &quot;Keep All the Fires Burning Bright&quot; began receiving radio adds in West Germany in December 1988 and the United Kingdom in March 1989. Despite this, the song failed to enter the singles charts in both countries.

The third single &quot;Love Get Ready&quot; began receiving radio adds in West Germany in April 1989. However, like with the previous single, this also failed to chart on the singles chart.

In addition to the three singles, the song &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; received a promotional release in Argentina.

The songs &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What You&#x27;ve Got (Until It&#x27;s Gone)&quot; and &quot;Love Get Ready&quot; received airplay in Greece soon after the album&#x27;s release despite neither being singles at the time.

==Reception==
The pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; named &quot;Passion&quot; one of its &quot;albums of the week&quot;. The magazine described the album as &quot;an energetic set of dramatic pop/rock, marked by square beats, a sentimental vibrato and a pompous setting&quot;. The &quot;slightly African-tinged&quot; and &quot;surprisingly light-weight&quot; song &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; was selected as the album&#x27;s highlight.

== Track listing ==


* Spanish LP copies of the album replace &quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only&quot; and &quot;Keep All the Fires Burning Bright&quot; with Spanish re-recordings of both songs titled &quot;Vida De Mi Vida&quot; and &quot;Solitaria Mujer&quot;. Spanish CD copies also include the original English versions as additional tracks at the end of the album.

<doc id="519204" wikidata="Q428813" url="?curid=519204" title="Hessenberg matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, a Hessenberg matrix is a special kind of square matrix, one that is &quot;almost&quot; triangular. To be exact, an upper Hessenberg matrix has zero entries below the first subdiagonal, and a lower Hessenberg matrix has zero entries above the first superdiagonal. They are named after Karl Hessenberg.

A Hessenberg decomposition is a matrix decomposition of a matrix formula_1 into a unitary matrix formula_2 and a Hessenberg matrix formula_3 such that formula_4 where formula_5 denotes the conjugate transpose.

==Definitions==
===Upper Hessenberg matrix===
A square formula_6 matrix formula_1 is said to be in upper Hessenberg form or to be an upper Hessenberg matrix if formula_8 for all formula_9 with formula_10.

An upper Hessenberg matrix is called unreduced if all subdiagonal entries are nonzero, i.e. if formula_11 for all formula_12.

===Lower Hessenberg matrix===
A square formula_6 matrix formula_1 is said to be in lower Hessenberg form or to be a lower Hessenberg matrix if its transpose formula_15 is an upper Hessenberg matrix or equivalently if formula_8 for all formula_9 with formula_18.

A lower Hessenberg matrix is called unreduced if all superdiagonal entries are nonzero, i.e. if formula_19 for all formula_12.

==Examples==
Consider the following matrices.
formula_21
formula_22
formula_23

The matrix formula_1 is an upper unreduced Hessenberg matrix, formula_25 is a lower unreduced Hessenberg matrix and formula_26 is a lower Hessenberg matrix but is not unreduced.

==Computer programming==
Many linear algebra algorithms require significantly less computational effort when applied to triangular matrices, and this improvement often carries over to Hessenberg matrices as well. If the constraints of a linear algebra problem do not allow a general matrix to be conveniently reduced to a triangular one, reduction to Hessenberg form is often the next best thing. In fact, reduction of any matrix to a Hessenberg form can be achieved in a finite number of steps (for example, through Householder&#x27;s transformation of unitary similarity transforms). Subsequent reduction of Hessenberg matrix to a triangular matrix can be achieved through iterative procedures, such as shifted QR-factorization. In eigenvalue algorithms, the Hessenberg matrix can be further reduced to a triangular matrix through Shifted QR-factorization combined with deflation steps. Reducing a general matrix to a Hessenberg matrix and then reducing further to a triangular matrix, instead of directly reducing a general matrix to a triangular matrix, often economizes the arithmetic involved in the QR algorithm for eigenvalue problems.

==Reduction to Hessenberg matrix==
===Householder transformations===
Any formula_6 matrix can be transformed into a Hessenberg matrix by a similarity transformation using Householder transformations. The following procedure for such a transformation is adapted from A Second Course In Linear Algebra by &quot;Garcia &amp; Roger&quot;.

Let formula_1 be any real or complex formula_6 matrix, then let formula_30 be the formula_31 submatrix of formula_1 constructed by removing the first row in formula_1 and let formula_34 be the first column of formula_35. Construct the formula_36 householder matrix formula_37 where
formula_38

This householder matrix will map formula_34 to formula_40 and as such, the block matrix formula_41 will map the matrix formula_1 to the matrix formula_43 which has only zeros below the second entry of the first column. Now construct formula_44 householder matrix formula_45 in a similar manner as formula_46 such that formula_45 maps the first column of formula_48 to formula_49, where formula_48 is the submatrix of formula_51 constructed by removing the first row and the first column of formula_51, then let formula_53 which maps formula_43 to the matrix formula_55 which has only zeros below the first and second entry of the subdiagonal. Now construct formula_56 and then formula_57 in a similar manner, but for the matrix formula_58 constructed by removing the first row and first column of formula_48 and proceed as in the previous steps. Continue like this for a total of formula_60 steps.

By construction of formula_61, the first formula_62 columns of any formula_6 matrix are invariant under multiplication by formula_64 from the right. Hence, any matrix can be transformed to an upper Hessenberg matrix by a similarity transformation of the form formula_65.

===Jacobi (Givens) rotations===
A Jacobi rotation (also called Givens rotation) is an orthogonal matrix transformation in the form
:formula_66
where formula_67, formula_68, is the Jacobi rotation matrix with all matrix elements equal zero except for
::formula_69
One can zero the matrix element formula_70 by choosing
the rotation angle formula_71 to satisfy the equation
:formula_72
Now, the sequence of such Jacobi rotations with the following formula_73
:formula_74
reduces the matrix formula_1 to the lower Hessenberg form.

==Properties==
For formula_76, it is vacuously true that every formula_77 matrix is both upper Hessenberg, and lower Hessenberg.

The product of a Hessenberg matrix with a triangular matrix is again Hessenberg. More precisely, if formula_1 is upper Hessenberg and formula_79 is upper triangular, then formula_80 and formula_81 are upper Hessenberg.

A matrix that is both upper Hessenberg and lower Hessenberg is a tridiagonal matrix, of which the Jacobi matrix is an important example. This includes the symmetric or Hermitian Hessenberg matrices. A Hermitian matrix can be reduced to tri-diagonal real symmetric matrices.

==Hessenberg operator==
The Hessenberg operator is an infinite dimensional Hessenberg matrix. It commonly occurs as the generalization of the Jacobi operator to a system of orthogonal polynomials for the space of square-integrable holomorphic functions over some domain—that is, a Bergman space. In this case, the Hessenberg operator is the right-shift operator formula_82, given by 
formula_83

The eigenvalues of each principal submatrix of the Hessenberg operator are given by the characteristic polynomial for that submatrix. These polynomials are called the Bergman polynomials, and provide an orthogonal polynomial basis for Bergman space.

<doc id="519209" wikidata="Q384952" url="?curid=519209" title="Atkinson cycle">
<text>The Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of internal combustion engine invented by James Atkinson in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of power density. 

A variation of this approach is used in some modern automobile engines. While originally seen exclusively in hybrid electric applications such as the earlier-generation Toyota Prius, later hybrids and some non-hybrid vehicles now feature engines with variable valve timing, which can run in the Atkinson cycle as a part-time operating regimen, giving good economy while running in Atkinson cycle, and conventional power density when running as a conventional, Otto cycle engine.

==Design==
Atkinson produced three different designs that had a short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The first Atkinson-cycle engine, the &quot;differential engine&quot;, used opposed pistons. The second and best-known design was the &quot;cycle engine&quot;, which used an over-center arm to create four piston strokes in one crankshaft revolution. The reciprocating engine had the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle in a single turn of the crankshaft, and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines. Atkinson&#x27;s third and final engine, the &quot;utilite engine&quot;, operated much like any two-stroke engine. 

The common thread throughout Atkinson&#x27;s designs is that the engines have an expansion stroke that is longer than the compression stroke, and by this method the engine achieves greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. Atkinson&#x27;s engines were produced by the British Gas Engine Company and also licensed to other overseas manufacturers. 

Many modern engines now use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke. Miller applied this technique to the four-stroke engine, so it is sometimes referred as the Atkinson/Miller cycle, US patent 2817322 dated Dec 24, 1957. In 1888, Charon filed a French patent and displayed an engine at the Paris Exhibition in 1889. The Charon gas engine (four-stroke) used a similar cycle to Miller, but without a supercharger. It is referred to as the &quot;Charon cycle&quot;.

Hugo Güldner argued in his 1914 book that Körting was the first firm to build a gas engine with a short compression stroke and a longer expansion phase in 1891, based on a design first proposed by Otto Köhler in 1887. This engine also had an engine-load dependent valve train which increased the intake and compression stroke with increasing engine load. On the other hand, the compression was decreasing at low and medium loads, which ultimately reduced the efficiency.

Roy Fedden, at Bristol, tested an arrangement in the Bristol Jupiter IV engine in 1928, with variable retard timing allowing part of the charge to be blown back into the intake manifold, in order to have sustainable reduced operation pressures during takeoff.

Modern engine designers are realizing the potential fuel-efficiency improvements the Atkinson-type cycle can provide.

==Atkinson &quot;Differential Engine&quot;==
The first implementation of the Atkinson cycle was in 1882; unlike later versions, it was arranged as an opposed-piston engine, the Atkinson differential engine. In this, a single crankshaft was connected to two opposed pistons through a toggle-jointed linkage that had a nonlinearity; for half a revolution, one piston remained almost stationary while the other approached it and returned, and then for the next half revolution, the second-mentioned piston was almost stationary while the first approached and returned. 

Thus, in each revolution, one piston provided a compression stroke and a power stroke, and then the other piston provided an exhaust stroke and a charging stroke. As the power piston remained withdrawn during exhaust and charging, it was practical to provide exhaust and charging using valves behind a port that was covered during the compression stroke and the power stroke, and so the valves did not need to resist high pressure and could be of the simpler sort used in many steam engines, or even reed valves.

==Atkinson &quot;Cycle Engine&quot;==
The next engine designed by Atkinson in 1887 was named the &quot;Cycle Engine&quot; This engine used poppet valves, a cam, and an over-center arm to produce four piston strokes for every revolution of the crankshaft. The intake and compression strokes were significantly shorter than the expansion and exhaust strokes. 

The &quot;Cycle&quot; engines were produced and sold for several years by the British Engine Company. Atkinson also licensed production to other manufacturers. Sizes ranged from a few up to 100 horsepower.

==Atkinson &quot;Utilite Engine&quot;==

Atkinson&#x27;s third design was named the &quot;Utilite Engine&quot;. Atkinson&#x27;s &quot;Cycle&quot; engine was efficient; however, its linkage was difficult to balance for high speed operation. Atkinson realized an improvement was needed to make his cycle more applicable as a higher-speed engine. 

With this new design, Atkinson was able to eliminate the linkages and make a more conventional, well balanced engine capable of operating at speeds up to 600 rpm and capable of producing power every revolution, yet he preserved all of the efficiency of his &quot;Cycle Engine&quot; having a proportionally short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The Utilite operates much like a standard two-stroke except that the exhaust port is located at about the middle of the stroke. 

During the expansion/power stroke, a cam-operated valve (which remains closed until the piston nears the end of the stroke) prevents pressure from escaping as the piston moves past the exhaust port. The exhaust valve is opened near the bottom of the stroke; it remains open as the piston heads back toward compression, letting fresh air charge the cylinder and exhaust escape until the port is covered by the piston. 

After the exhaust port is covered the piston begins to compress the remaining air in the cylinder. A small piston fuel pump injects liquid during compression. The ignition source was likely a hot tube as in Atkinson&#x27;s other engines. This design resulted in a two-stroke engine with a short compression and longer expansion stroke. 

The Utilite Engine tested as even more efficient than Atkinson&#x27;s previous &quot;differential&quot; and &quot;cycle&quot; designs. Very few were produced, and none are known to survive. The British patent is from 1892, #2492. No US patent for the Utilite Engine is known.

==Ideal thermodynamic cycle==
The ideal Atkinson cycle consists of:
* 1–2 Isentropic, or reversible, adiabatic compression
* 2–3 Isochoric heating (Qp)
* 3–4 Isobaric heating (Qp&#x27;)
* 4–5 Isentropic expansion
* 5–6 Isochoric cooling (Qo)
* 6–1 Isobaric cooling (Qo&#x27;)

==Modern Atkinson-cycle engines==
In the late 20th century, the term &quot;Atkinson cycle&quot; began to be used to describe a modified Otto-cycle engine—in which the intake valve is held open longer than normal, allowing a reverse flow of intake air into the intake manifold. This &quot;simulated&quot; Atkinson cycle is most notably used in the Toyota 1NZ-FXE engine from the early Prius and the Toyota Dynamic Force engines. 

The effective compression ratio is reduced—for the time the air is escaping the cylinder freely rather than being compressed—but the &quot;expansion&quot; ratio is unchanged (i.e., the compression ratio is smaller than the expansion ratio). The goal of the modern Atkinson cycle is to make the pressure in the combustion chamber at the end of the power stroke equal to atmospheric pressure. When this occurs, all available energy has been obtained from the combustion process. For any given portion of air, the greater expansion ratio converts more energy from heat to useful mechanical energy—meaning the engine is more efficient.

The disadvantage of the four-stroke Atkinson-cycle engine versus the more common Otto-cycle engine is reduced power density. Due to a smaller portion of the compression stroke being devoted to compressing the intake air, an Atkinson-cycle engine does not take in as much air as would a similarly designed and sized Otto-cycle engine. Four-stroke engines of this type that use the same type of intake valve motion but also utilize forced induction to make up for the loss of power density are known as Miller-cycle engines.

==Rotary Atkinson-cycle engine==
The Atkinson cycle can be used in a rotary engine. In this configuration, an increase in both power and efficiency can be achieved when compared to the Otto cycle. This type of engine retains the one power phase per revolution, together with the different compression and expansion volumes of the original Atkinson cycle.

Exhaust gases are expelled from the engine by compressed-air scavenging. This modification of the Atkinson cycle allows the use of alternative fuels such as diesel and hydrogen. 

Disadvantages of this design include the requirement that rotor tips seal very tightly on the outer housing wall and the mechanical losses suffered through friction between rapidly oscillating parts of irregular shape. See external links below for more information.

The Sachs KC-27 Wankel engine in the Hercules W-2000 motorcycle used the Atkinson cycle. A depression capsule opens a secondary path for the incoming charge.

==Vehicles using Atkinson-cycle engines==

While a modified Otto-cycle piston engine using the Atkinson cycle provides good fuel efficiency, it is at the expense of a lower power-per-displacement as compared to a traditional four-stroke engine. If demand for more power is intermittent, the power of the engine can be supplemented by an electric motor during times when more power is needed. This forms the basis of an Atkinson cycle-based hybrid electric drivetrain. These electric motors can be used independently of, or in combination with, the Atkinson-cycle engine, to provide the most efficient means of producing the desired power. This drive-train first entered production in late 1997 in the first-generation Toyota Prius.

<text>Pak Tea House in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] is a haunt of writers and poets, known for its association with progressive academics and left-leaning South Asian intelligentsia.

Traditionally frequented by country&#x27;s notably artistic, cultural and literary personalities, it was founded by a Sikh family in 1940 and quickly acquired its current name after it was leased to one of the locals in Lahore after the partition of India in 1947. Intervention of Lahore High Court had led to the re-opening of the Tea House in 2013. Noted for being the birthplace of influential literary movement, the Progressive Writers&#x27; Association, the place is described as a hub of Lahore&#x27;s intellectual life for many years.

== History ==
The café was set up in 1940 as the &quot;India Tea House&quot; by Boota Singh, a Sikh family in Lahore. In 1944, it was taken over by two Sikh brothers Surtej Singh Bhalla and Kaiser Singh Bhalla. It remained closed during the 1947 partition riots, and in 1948, Sirajuddin Ahmed, a local food supplier, rented the place from Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association&#x27;s administration. He renamed it &quot;Pak Tea House&quot; in 1950 and ran this restaurant successfully from 1948 to 1978. After his death, his son Zahid Hasan managed the cafe and restaurant. This historic tea house was known as a meeting place and was frequented by the city&#x27;s artists and literary personalities, especially until the 1990s. It was closed in 2000 with the decline in customers. During this period, its ownership was taken over by the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association.

Among the luminaries known to visit Pak Tea House, were: Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ibn-e-Insha, Ahmed Faraz, Saadat Hasan Manto, Josh Malihabadi, Sahir Ludhianvi, Amrita Pritam, Munshi Premchand, Majrooh Sultanpuri, M. D. Taseer, Krishan Chander, Ismat Chughtai, Ahmad Rahi, Muneer Niazi, Meeraji, Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi, Habib Jalib, Kaifi Azmi, Kamal Ahmed Rizvi, Nasir Kazmi, Intezar Hussain, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Firaq Gorakhpuri, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan, Agha Shorish Kashmiri, Professor Sayyid Sajjad Rizvi, Dr. Muhammad Baqir, Mr. Farhad Ahmad Hotiana, Shaheer Ahmad Khan and Syed Qasim Mahmood.

Pak Tea House became a birthplace of the influential literary movement. It was and remained popular for its best and quick service, specially during lunch hours. They even serve customer who do not even want to come inside the tea-house. Staff is trained to drag people inside the premises and feed them forcefully, the Progressive Writers&#x27; Association in Pakistan, known for left-wing politics since its foundation in 1940. Many writers frequented it, and it was also a favorite gathering place of the section of Lahore&#x27;s youth with non-mainstream points of view. It maintained a reputation as a forum for people of diverse backgrounds to voice their opinions in a non-judgmental atmosphere.

In 1999, it was closed by its owner due to lack of business, a decision criticized by the intellectual community of Lahore. It remained closed for 13 years until 2 February 2012 when, on the orders of the Lahore commissioner, Pak Tea House was again put under the control of the YMCA. On 8 March 2013, Pak Tea House located on Mall Road, near Neela Gumbad and Anarkali Bazaar, was reinaugurated by the Government of Punjab. In October 2013, the government handed over the Pak Tea House to the Walled City Lahore Authority. Pak Tea House is still popular amongst students who reportedly say that the food and snacks are reasonably priced and of good quality. Pictures of many literary figures who used to visit this place, are mounted on the cafe&#x27;s walls.

==Reopening==
In June 2012, the government of Punjab announced its intention to reopen the Pak Tea House, where it would support itself. On Friday 8 March 2013, Lahore&#x27;s iconic Pak Tea House reopened after 13 years of closure. Among the attendees was the Pakistani writer Ata ul Haq Qasmi. Pak Tea House remains a special place for those who remember Lahore&#x27;s lively literary and cultural past.

<doc id="519216" wikidata="Q1098202" url="?curid=519216" title="Quarth">
<text>, known as Block Hole outside Japan, is a hybrid puzzle/shoot &#x27;em up game developed by Konami which was released in 1989 as an arcade game. Besides the arcade version, there were also ports of the game to the MSX2 (with a built-in SCC chip), Famicom, and Game Boy—home releases used the &quot;Quarth&quot; name worldwide (with the exception of the Game Boy Color release in Europe of &quot;Konami GB Collection Vol. 2&quot;, where the game was renamed to the generic title &quot;Block Game&quot; for unknown reasons).

&quot;Quarth&quot; was released on the Konami Net i-mode service as &quot;Block Quarth&quot;, with an updated &quot;Block Quarth DX&quot; in 2001. It was released without the &quot;DX&quot; suffix in 2005 and was made globally available through Konami Net licensing on many i-mode services offered by mobile operators. In Europe, for example, it was available from O2 UK, O2 Ireland, and Telefónica Spain.

In 2005, Konami also included the game in the Nintendo DS title &quot;Ganbare Goemon: Tōkaidōchū Ōedo Tengurikaeshi no Maki&quot;. An emulated version of the game was released in 2006 for PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of the &quot;Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono&quot; series.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Quarth&quot; is a combination of &quot;Tetris&quot;-style gameplay and a fixed shooter in the &quot;Space Invaders&quot; tradition. The player&#x27;s focus is on falling blocks, and the action is geometrical. Rather than arranging the blocks together to make a row of disappearing blocks, a spaceship positioned at the bottom of the screen shoots blocks upwards to make the falling block pattern into squares or rectangles. Once the blocks have been arranged properly, the shape is destroyed and the player is awarded points based on the shape&#x27;s size. The blocks continue to drop from the top of the screen in various incomplete shapes. As each level progresses, the blocks drop at greater speed and frequency. There are also various power-ups which could be located to increase ship&#x27;s speed, among other bonuses.

The game continues until the blocks reach the dotted line at the bottom of the screen, whereupon the player&#x27;s ship is &quot;player&#x27;s ship is &quot;quarthed&quot;, crushed flat.

=== Multiplayer ===
The Arcade, MSX2, and Famicom versions had two different 2-player modes: a split-screen mode with Player 1 on the left and Player 2 on the right, and a cooperative mode where both players shared the same screen.

For the Game Boy, multiplayer requires the Game Boy Link Cable with each player able to view only their fields on their own Game Boys.

== Merchandise ==
=== Soundtrack ===
* In addition, disc 14 of &quot;Konami Music Masterpiece Collection&quot;, which was released on October 1, 2004, is mostly devoted to &quot;Quarth&quot;.
* The game soundtrack of was released on May 30, 2014, by EGG MUSIC and Konami Kukeiha Club and composed by Norio Hanzawa, exclusively in Japan.

=== Manga ===
* &quot;Quarth&quot; is one of the video games featured in the manga titled &quot;Rock&#x27;n Game Boy&quot;, by Shigeto Ikehara and published by Comic BomBom from October 1989 to December 1991.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Quarth&quot; on their December 1, 1989 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month. &quot;Block Hole&quot; was a hit overseas in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom and Italy.

It has been generally acclaimed by many online reviewers, though &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the Game Boy port on the 3DS Virtual Console a 6/10.

<doc id="519217" wikidata="Q2981644" url="?curid=519217" title="Magellanic subpolar forests">
<text>The Magellanic subpolar forests () are a terrestrial ecoregion of southernmost South America, covering parts of southern Chile and Argentina, and are part of the Neotropical realm. It is a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion, and contains the world&#x27;s southernmost forests.

==Setting==
The Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion lies to the west of the Andes Mountains, which run north-south for most of their length but curve eastward near the southern tip of South America, terminating at the archipelago of Tierra del Fuego. The Magellanic ecoregion was covered by glaciers during the last ice age, and the landscape is deeply dissected by fjords, with numerous islands, inlets, and channels, including the Strait of Magellan, which separates Tierra del Fuego from the South American mainland and is the route taken by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan from the South Atlantic to the South Pacific. 
North of roughly 48° south latitude lies the Valdivian temperate forests ecoregion, which shares many affinities with the Magellanic ecoregion in plant and animal life. To the east lie the drier temperate grasslands and shrublands ecoregions of Patagonia, which are in the rain shadow of the Andean and Fuegian mountains.

==Climate==
The Andean and Fuegan mountains intercept moisture-laden westerly winds, creating temperate rain forest conditions, while the cold oceanic Humboldt Current, which runs up the west coast of South America, and the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which runs from west to east through the Southern Ocean, keep the Magellanic ecoregion cool and wet, and the strong oceanic influence moderates seasonal temperature extremes. Average annual temperatures vary from in the north to in the south and annual rainfall from in the west to in the east. Snowfalls are very common in the west and can occur even in summer. Fog is very frequent. Very strong winds whip the region compelling trees to grow in twisted and bent shapes known as flag trees.

==Flora==
Like the Valdivian ecoregion, the Magellanic subpolar forests are a refuge for the Antarctic flora, and share many plant families with the temperate forest ecoregions of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia, especially the southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;). Species of &#x27;, including &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;, are the characteristic trees of the Magellanic ecoregion. The Magellanic ecoregion does not have the same species richness as the milder Valdivian ecoregion, both on account of its colder climate and its recent glaciation. The advancing glaciers caused the forests to retreat far to the north, and the region was gradually reforested starting about 10,000 years ago when the climate warmed and the glaciers began retreating.

The Magellanic ecoregion has three main plant communities: the Magellanic moorland, the evergreen Magellanic rainforest, and the deciduous Magellanic forest.

The Magellanic moorland occurs on the western edge of the region where the oceanic influence is strongest. High rainfall of is typical of the moorland, as are cool temperatures, strong winds, bad drainage conditions, and rocky ground with generally thin soil. Most of the moorland consists of a mosaic of low-growing plants, including dwarf shrubs and wind-sheared trees, cushion plants, grasses, and mosses. These plants can form an underlayer of blanket peat and boggy areas. In more sheltered areas, small stands of evergreen forest can be found, which include &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot;, &quot;Drimys winteri&quot;, &quot;Lepidothamnus fonkii&quot;, and &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot;. 

Farther from the ocean, in more moderate areas less exposed to the oceanic wind and rain, moorland yields to evergreen Magellanic rainforest. The Magellanic rainforest is mostly made up &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot;, together with other evergreen trees, most often &quot;Drimys winteri&quot; and &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot;, and occasionally &quot;Embothrium coccineum&quot; and &quot;Maytenus magellanica&quot;. In the better established forest stands, a species-rich shrub layer may develop. In exposed, rocky, and poorly drained areas, pockets of deciduous &quot;&quot; and the typical moorland species can be found.

As one moves further east, where rainfall decreases to , &#x27; becomes less dominant and mixes with deciduous &#x27; in the transition to the deciduous forest community. The Magellanic deciduous forest is made up mostly of &#x27; and &#x27;. When one reaches the drier rain shadow east of the mountains, the forests disappear, transitioning to the grassland ecoregions of Patagonia.

In open spaces some succulent fruits can be found: Chilean strawberry (&quot;Fragaria chiloensis&quot;), and calafate (&quot;Berberis microphylla&quot;); they used to complement the nourishment of the (now almost nonexistent) native peoples.

These forests are peerless in their endurance of cold summers (averaging at sea level) and violent subpolar winds. Due to these traits, Magellanic forests&#x27; tree species are exported to other parts of the world such as the Faroe Islands and neighboring archipelagos with similar conditions where trees from other biomes in the world cannot grow. The following species from Tierra del Fuego, &quot;Drimys winteri&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus pumilio&quot;, and &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot;, have been successfully introduced to the Faroe Islands. As a general rule, Fueguian trees show better signs of acclimation than those from Continental Northern Europe to conditions in the Faroe Islands.

==Fauna==
The Magellanic subpolar forests are home to the southern pudú (&quot;Pudu puda&quot;), the world&#x27;s smallest deer, which stands only high at the shoulder. Other animal species include the cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and the endangered southern river otter (&quot;Lontra provocax&quot;). Endemic rodents include the Patagonian mara, the long-clawed mole mouse, and the viscacha, a small rodent that looks almost like a rabbit with a long, bushy tail.

Native bird species include the Magellanic woodpecker (&quot;Campephilus magellanicus&quot;), Patagonian sierra-finch (&quot;Phrygilus patagonicus&quot;), Patagonian mockingbird (&quot;Mimus patagonicus&quot;), and Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;).

The rich Magellanic coastal waters and numerous rocky islets host many seabirds, including albatrosses, auks, gulls, terns, and penguins.

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 69,938 km², or 46%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

<text>In linear algebra, a tridiagonal matrix is a band matrix that has nonzero elements only on the main diagonal, the subdiagonal/lower diagonal (the first diagonal below this), and the supradiagonal/upper diagonal (the first diagonal above the main diagonal). For example, the following matrix is tridiagonal:
:formula_1

The determinant of a tridiagonal matrix is given by the &quot;continuant&quot; of its elements.

An orthogonal transformation of a symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix to tridiagonal form can be done with the Lanczos algorithm.

==Properties==
A tridiagonal matrix is a matrix that is both upper and lower Hessenberg matrix. In particular, a tridiagonal matrix is a direct sum of &quot;p&quot; 1-by-1 and &quot;q&quot; 2-by-2 matrices such that — the dimension of the tridiagonal. Although a general tridiagonal matrix is not necessarily symmetric or Hermitian, many of those that arise when solving linear algebra problems have one of these properties. Furthermore, if a real tridiagonal matrix &quot;A&quot; satisfies &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;+1 &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1,&quot;k&quot; &gt; 0 for all &quot;k&quot;, so that the signs of its entries are symmetric, then it is similar to a Hermitian matrix, by a diagonal change of basis matrix. Hence, its eigenvalues are real. If we replace the strict inequality by &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;+1 &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1,&quot;k&quot; ≥ 0, then by continuity, the eigenvalues are still guaranteed to be real, but the matrix need no longer be similar to a Hermitian matrix.

The set of all &quot;n × n&quot; tridiagonal matrices forms a &quot;3n-2&quot;
dimensional vector space.

Many linear algebra algorithms require significantly less computational effort when applied to diagonal matrices, and this improvement often carries over to tridiagonal matrices as well.

===Determinant===

The determinant of a tridiagonal matrix &quot;A&quot; of order &quot;n&quot; can be computed from a three-term recurrence relation. Write &quot;f&quot;1 = |&quot;a&quot;1| = &quot;a&quot;1 (i.e., &quot;f&quot;1 is the determinant of the 1 by 1 matrix consisting only of &quot;a&quot;1), and let

:formula_2

The sequence (&quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;) is called the continuant and satisfies the recurrence relation

:formula_3

with initial values &quot;f&quot;0 = 1 and &quot;f&quot;−1 = 0. The cost of computing the determinant of a tridiagonal matrix using this formula is linear in &quot;n&quot;, while the cost is cubic for a general matrix.

===Inversion===

The inverse of a non-singular tridiagonal matrix &quot;T&quot;

:formula_4

is given by

:formula_5

where the &quot;θi&quot; satisfy the recurrence relation

:formula_6

with initial conditions &quot;θ&quot;0 = 1, &quot;θ&quot;1 = &quot;a&quot;1 and the &quot;ϕ&quot;&quot;i&quot; satisfy

:formula_7

with initial conditions &quot;ϕ&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = 1 and &quot;ϕ&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;an&quot;.

Closed form solutions can be computed for special cases such as symmetric matrices with all diagonal and off-diagonal elements equal or Toeplitz matrices and for the general case as well.

In general, the inverse of a tridiagonal matrix is a semiseparable matrix and vice versa. The inverse of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be written as a single-pair matrix (a.k.a. &quot;generator-representable semiseparable matrix&quot;) of the form

formula_8

where formula_9
with formula_10

===Solution of linear system===

A system of equations &quot;Ax&quot; = &quot;b&quot; for formula_11 can be solved by an efficient form of Gaussian elimination when &quot;A&quot; is tridiagonal called tridiagonal matrix algorithm, requiring &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) operations.

===Eigenvalues===

When a tridiagonal matrix is also Toeplitz, there is a simple closed-form solution for its eigenvalues, namely:

:formula_12

A real symmetric tridiagonal matrix has real eigenvalues, and all the eigenvalues are distinct (simple) if all off-diagonal elements are nonzero. Numerous methods exist for the numerical computation of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix to arbitrary finite precision, typically requiring formula_13 operations for a matrix of size formula_14, although fast algorithms exist which (without parallel computation) require only formula_15.

As a side note, an &quot;unreduced&quot; symmetric tridiagonal matrix is a matrix containing non-zero off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal, where the eigenvalues are distinct while the eigenvectors are unique up to a scale factor and are mutually orthogonal.

=== Similarity to symmetric tridiagonal matrix ===
For &quot;unsymmetric&quot; or &quot;nonsymmetric&quot; tridiagonal matrices one can compute the eigendecomposition using a similarity transformation.
Given a real tridiagonal, nonsymmetric matrix 
:formula_16
where formula_17.
Assume that each product of off-diagonal entries is positive formula_18 and define a transformation matrix formula_19 by 
:formula_20

The similarity transformation formula_21 yields a &quot;symmetric&quot; tridiagonal matrix formula_22 by: 
:formula_23
Note that formula_24 and formula_22 have the same eigenvalues.

==Computer programming==
A transformation that reduces a general matrix to Hessenberg form will reduce a Hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form. So, many eigenvalue algorithms, when applied to a Hermitian matrix, reduce the input Hermitian matrix to (symmetric real) tridiagonal form as a first step.

A tridiagonal matrix can also be stored more efficiently than a general matrix by using a special storage scheme. For instance, the LAPACK Fortran package stores an unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix of order &quot;n&quot; in three one-dimensional arrays, one of length &quot;n&quot; containing the diagonal elements, and two of length &quot;n&quot; − 1 containing the subdiagonal and superdiagonal elements.

==Applications==
The discretization in space of the one-dimensional diffusion or heat equation 
:formula_26
using second order central finite differences results in 

:formula_27
with discretization constant formula_28. The matrix is tridiagonal with formula_29 and formula_30. Note: no boundary conditions are used here.

<doc id="519222" wikidata="Q1586493" url="?curid=519222" title="Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949">
<text>The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, Act No. 55 of 1949, was an apartheid-era law in South Africa that prohibited marriages between &quot;whites&quot; and &quot;non-whites&quot;. It was among the first pieces of apartheid legislation to be passed following the National Party&#x27;s rise to power in 1948. Subsequent legislation, especially the Population Registration and Immorality Acts of 1950, facilitated its implementation by requiring all individuals living in South Africa to register as a member of one of four officially defined racial groups and prohibiting extramarital sexual relationships between those classified as &quot;white&quot; on the one hand and those classified as &quot;non-White&quot; (Blacks, Coloureds, later also Asians) on the other. It did not criminalise sexual relationships between those classified as &quot;non-Europeans&quot;.

==History==
===Background===
Mixed races relationships occurred in South Africa as far back as 1669, and often took place between Dutch colonisers and indigenous South African women.

While mixed marriages did not become completely taboo until the rise of the National Party in 1948, in the years immediately preceding the passing of this Act, mixed marriages accounted for just a small fraction of all marriages in South Africa, and occurred almost evenly between the four defined racial groups (Black, Coloured, White, and Asiatic).

===Implementation===
In July 1949, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, Act No 55 of 1949 that prohibited marriage or a sexual relationship between White people and people of other race groups in South Africa was passed. 
Enforcement of the act was left to the police, who often followed people to their homes to ensure they were not in violation and raided the homes of those believed to be in a mixed marriage. The act applied to all mixed marriages between South Africans, so even marriages which took place in another country were not recognised within South Africa. The punishment for people found to be in a mixed marriage involved arrest and a jail sentence. Anyone who knowingly officiated a marriage that violated the act was also subject to a punishment: a fine was imposed not exceeding 50 pounds. Anyone who was found to have lied to an officiant was also subject to the legal punishment for perjury.

Some of the social consequences of entering into a mixed-race marriage included being ostracised from or ridiculed by one&#x27;s family and community. One example is a white South African sex worker named Ethal, who indicated that she felt more accepted by her peers when she was a sex worker than when she married a black African man.

In 1972, over 300 people were convicted under the act. These numbers had dropped to 187 people prosecuted and 97 convicted in 1980, with increased leniency shown towards Indians and Coloureds. In 1982, Prime Minister P.W. Botha gave Ian Whiteley, a white man, and his Indian wife, Sherrin, his blessing for the couple to live at the edge of an Indian township in Pietersburg.

===Legislative history===
The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act of 1968 updated the original legislation to invalidate interracial marriages involving a South African citizen that were contracted in other countries.

The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was repealed by the Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985, which was passed during the presidency of P. W. Botha.

<doc id="519230" wikidata="Q880606" url="?curid=519230" title="John A. Burns">
<text>John Anthony Burns (March 30, 1909 – April 5, 1975) was an American politician. Burns was born in Montana and became a resident of Hawaii in 1913. He served as the second governor of Hawaii from 1962 to 1974.

==Early life==

John Burns was born in Fort Assinniboine, Montana, on March 30, 1909. He was the eldest son of Anne and Harry Burns. Christened Harry John Burns, as a teenager he changed his name to John Anthony Burns.

Burns&#x27;s father was in the army and was ordered to Fort Shafter in Hawaii, so in 1913 he and his family moved to Hawaii, and eventually to Kalihi. Harry Burns became overwhelmed with responsibility for four children and left the family in 1919. Burns&#x27;s mother became a launderer for Tripler Army Medical Center. Burns took care of his siblings and attended Saint Louis School, while his mother worked. She joined the Postal Service, and with the help of her brother, became postmaster for Fort Shafter and a clerk at the Honolulu Post office. In 1925 Anne sent John to live with her brother in Kansas, where Jack Scally served as a father figure. In Kansas he attended Immaculata High School in Leavenworth, then transferred to St. Benedict High School (now Maur Hill – Mount Academy) in Atchison.

In 1927 Burns dropped out of high school and joined the army, but did not like taking orders. He was honorably discharged after one year. Burns returned to Hawaii, waiting a semester to attend Saint Louis School and eventually graduate in 1930.

==Political career==
Burns&#x27;s work as a police officer helped him build close ties with working class people from numerous ethnic groups, notably Japanese and native Hawaiians. While a police officer in Honolulu, his first political efforts arose from his work with the Police Benevolent Society. From 1948 he led the Hawaii Democratic Revolution of 1954, through various leadership positions in the territorial Democratic Party, culminating in being chair of the territorial party in 1952. He is credited with building a coalition for the Democratic Party that included the Communist Party, 442nd Regimental Combat Team veterans, ILWU, other organized labor groups, and Japanese Americans to strengthen the party. In 1956, he was elected a party delegate from Hawaii. As a delegate, Burns played a key role in lobbying for Hawaii statehood, a goal that was achieved on March 12, 1959, when the statehood bill was signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He sought to become the first governor of the newly formed state, but lost the election to Territorial Governor William F. Quinn.

===Governorship===
Three years later in 1962, Burns won the election to become governor. Governor Burns played a leading role in stimulating the state economy and attracting foreign tourism and investment. His many achievements include the promotion of Hawaii as a center for oceanography, construction of the new State Capitol building, and expansion of the University of Hawaii, helping to transform it into a first-class university, attracting students and faculty from around the world and early planning for the construction of the Aloha Stadium to host university football and bowl games. Burns supported the construction of an expanded Honolulu International Airport with a new reef-runway and the construction of Interstate H-3.

Additionally, he supported planning for the future by establishing the Hawaii Commission on the Year 2000, which ultimately led to the development of the &quot;Quality Growth Policy&quot; for the State of Hawaii. Both the Commission on the Year 2000 and Hawaii&#x27;s &quot;Quality Growth Policy&quot; were intended to supplement Hawaii&#x27;s State Land-Use Plan. Finally, Governor Burns made Hawaii a leader in environmental management, establishing the Office of Environmental Quality Control, within the Governor&#x27;s Office, to coordinate state environmental policy and to review environmental impact statements on all major state actions.

Burns was re-elected in 1966 and 1970, each time with a different lieutenant governor as his running mate. In 1966, he was elected governor with Lieutenant Governor Thomas Gill. During his term as lieutenant governor, Gill, considered outspoken and acerbic, developed differences with Burns, and was never shy about criticizing the incumbent, despite being part of his administration. In 1970, Gill challenged Burns in the Democratic primary. Gill ran as a reformer, campaigning against what he described as an entrenched, corrupt political machine. He narrowly lost, even though Burns significantly outspent him in a savvy campaign that included sophisticated use of expensive image-building television spots. Most in the state&#x27;s large Japanese population remained loyal to Burns, who had spearheaded their rise to political power during the 1950s. Before Neil Abercrombie lost in 2014 this race stood as the closest anyone came to a primary defeat of an incumbent governor of Hawaii. Burns&#x27;s running-mate in 1970, George Ariyoshi, ran to succeed Burns as governor in 1974, defeating Gill in the Democratic primary.

==Later life and death==
Burns became ill from cancer to the point of incapacity in October 1973. Burns&#x27;s third elected lieutenant governor, George Ariyoshi, became acting governor through the end of Burns&#x27;s third term. Ariyoshi was elected in his own right as governor for the term beginning in 1974. Burns died on April 5, 1975, in Honolulu.

==Legacy==
The John A. Burns School of Medicine, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, is named for him. In 1997, Governor Ben Cayetano named the newly completed Interstate H-3 in his honor, and the road to the summit of Mauna Kea is also named after him. A Hawaii golf tournament, comprising the state&#x27;s best amateurs and PGA professionals, was created in his honor. The Governor&#x27;s Cup is a team event, and is played between the amateurs against the professionals. A special qualifier for the amateur team after the tournament will provide the medalist a chance to play in the Sony Open in Hawaii, a PGA Tour Event.

<doc id="519233" wikidata="Q720835" url="?curid=519233" title="Isetta">
<text>The Isetta is an Italian-designed microcar initially manufactured in 1953 by the Italian firm Iso SpA, and subsequently built under license in a number of different countries, including Argentina, Spain, Belgium, France, Brazil, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The name &quot;Isetta&quot; is the Italian diminutive form of &quot;Iso&quot;, meaning &quot;little Iso&quot;. Because of its egg shape and bubble-like windows, it became known as a bubble car, a name also given to other similar vehicles.

In 1955, the BMW Isetta became the world&#x27;s first mass-production car to achieve a fuel consumption of . It was the top-selling single-cylinder car in the world, with 161,728 units sold.

== Iso Isetta (Italy) ==
The car originated with the Italian firm of Iso SpA. In the early 1950s the company was building refrigerators, motor scooters and small three-wheeled trucks. Iso&#x27;s owner, Renzo Rivolta, decided to build a small car for mass distribution. By 1952 the engineers and Pierluigi Raggi had designed a small car that used the motorcycle engine of the Iso Moto 200 and named it Isetta.

The Isetta caused a sensation when it was introduced to the motoring press in Turin in November 1953. It was unlike anything seen before. Small (only long by wide) and egg-shaped, with bubble-type windows, the entire front end of the car hinged outwards to allow entry. In the event of an accident, the driver and passenger were to exit through the canvas sunroof. The steering wheel and instrument panel swung out with the single door, simplifying access to the single bench seat. The seat provided reasonable comfort for two occupants, and perhaps a small child. Behind the seat was a large parcel shelf with a spare wheel located below. A heater was optional. Ventilation was provided by turning out the front triangle windows and/or opening the fabric sunroof.

Power came from a , two-stroke split-single motorcycle engine. The engine was started by a combination generator-starter known as &quot;Dynastart&quot;. A manual gearbox provided four forward speeds and reverse. A chain drive connected the gearbox to a solid rear axle with a pair of closely spaced rear wheels. The first prototypes had one wheel at the rear, but having a single rear wheel made the car prone to roll-overs, so the rear wheel layout was changed to two wheels set apart from each other. This narrow track eliminated the need for a differential. The front axle was a modified version of a Dubonnet independent front suspension.

The Isetta took over 30 seconds to reach from rest. Top speed was about . The fuel tank held ; the Isetta would get somewhere between and .

In 1954, Iso entered several Isettas in the legendary Mille Miglia where they took the top three spots in the economy classification. Over a distance of , the drivers achieved an average speed of over .

After its initial success, the Isetta was beginning to slip in popularity at home, mainly due to renewed competition from Fiat with its 500C model.

Renzo Rivolta wanted to concentrate on his new Iso Rivolta sports car, and was interested in doing licensing deals. Plants in Spain and Belgium were already assembling &quot;Isettas&quot; and &quot;Autocarros&quot; using Italian-made Iso components. BMW began talking with Rivolta in mid-1954 and bought not just a license but also the complete Isetta body tooling. Rivolta also negotiated licensing deals with companies in France and Brazil.

After some 1,000 units, production of the Italian built cars ceased in 1955. Iso continued to build the Isetta in Spain until 1958.

=== Iso Autocarro ===
In addition to the Iso Isetta &quot;vettura&quot; described above, Iso also built the &quot;Autocarro&quot;, a commercial version with full-width rear axle. The &quot;Autocarro&quot; was offered in several body styles—a flatbed pickup, enclosed truck, a tilt-bed or even a fire engine—although some of these might not have been sold. The &quot;Autocarro&quot; was very popular in Italy, and many manufacturers produced some variant of the type.

Iso had previously produced a motorcycle-type &quot;Isocarro&quot;. The Iso &quot;Autocarro&quot; was larger than most, with its four-wheel layout, conventional rear axle with differential and leaf springs, and a large tubular, ladder-type frame. It could carry a load. The name &quot;Isetta Autocarro&quot; was also used. It is thought that more than 4,000 &quot;Autocarros&quot; were built between 1954 and 1958. The Autocarro was also built in Spain.
== VELAM Isetta (France) ==
In 1954, VELAM acquired a licence from Iso to manufacture a car based on the Isetta. Since Iso had sold the body making equipment to BMW, VELAM developed their own body but used the original Iso engine. The VELAM body was rounder and more egg-like than Iso&#x27;s Isetta and was known by the French as the &#x27;yogurt pot&#x27;. Instead of a chassis like the Italian and German versions, there was a sub-frame bolted to the body at the rear, which held the rear tires, engine, and transmission. The front suspension was bolted to the front of the body. The front door was opened by push button instead of a handle, and the speedometer was mounted in the center of the steering wheel.
VELAM started production of the car in June 1955 at the old Talbot factory at Suresnes, France, and the car was introduced at the 1955 Paris Motor Show. All told, five versions of the car were built: the standard Isetta, a convertible version, a luxury version, a one-off &quot;Sport&quot; version, and a record car with a roadster body. The luxury model, called Écrin (&quot;jewel box&quot;), was presented in 1957 and built in 500 examples. In 1957, the streamlined roadster set seven world records for the sub-250 cc class at the Linas-Montlhéry autodrome. Due to competition from the Citroën 2CV and then the Renault Dauphine, production ceased in January 1958.

==De Carlo – Isetta (Argentina)==

The Metalmecánica Company in Buenos Aires commenced automotive manufacturing in 1959, when they started assembling a licensed version of the BMW Isetta. This received a light redesign, with a tiny, two-piece grille being installed on the door. 798 examples were made, but they soon changed over to the BMW 600, which was built in 1,413 examples from 1959 until 1962. Metalmecánica went on to build the BMW 700, which they later redesigned to look similar to the Simca 1000. In 1965, they changed over and began building Simca Arianes under license from the French company SIMCA.

==Romi-Isetta (Brazil)==

In 1955, Iso licensed the Isetta to Indústrias Romi S.A., a machine-tool manufacturer headquartered in the city of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste, in the state of São Paulo. The Isetta was chosen, because it was considered an ideal vehicle for use in the cities by virtue of its size and economy. Released on September 5, 1956, it was one of the first cars produced in Brazil, after Ford do Brasil and General Motors do Brasil. The car had received government approval as a part of a state-supported drive to establish an automotive industry in Brazil, but ended up being built without government backing.

Some 3,000 of the Romi-Isettas were manufactured from 1956 to 1961. They kept the Iso design and used Iso engines until 1958, in 1959 they switched to the BMW 300 cc engines.
== BMW Isetta (West Germany) ==

The BMW Isetta differed widely from the Iso model. While the major elements of the Italian design remained intact, BMW re-engineered much of the car – so much so that none of the parts between a BMW Isetta Moto Coupe and an Iso Isetta are interchangeable. BMW changed the powerplant to a one-cylinder, four-stroke, 247 cc motorcycle engine of their own manufacture which generated .

The first BMW Isetta appeared in April 1955. In May 1962, three years after launching the conventionally modern-looking BMW 700, BMW ceased production of Isettas. A total of 161,728 units had been built.

In the 1990s, the BMW Isetta had garnered a resurgence through the television show &quot;Family Matters&quot;, in which one of the main characters, Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), drives a 1960 BMW Isetta.

===BMW Isetta 250===
While it retained the &quot;bubble window&quot; styling, it differed from the Italian model in that its headlamps were fixed separately to the sides of the bodywork and it carried the BMW badge below the windscreen. The car was also redesigned to take a modified version of the 250 cc four-stroke engine from the BMW R25/3 motorcycle and the front suspension was changed. The single-cylinder generated at 5800 rpm. The crankcase and cylinder were made of cast iron, the cylinder head of aluminium alloy. The head was rotated by 180° compared with the motorcycle engine. The twin-bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta motor, being larger and featuring reinforced bearings. One of the reasons for this was the heavy &quot;Dynastart&quot; unit, a combined dynamo and starter-motor. The fuel mixture was provided by a sliding throttle side draft motorcycle carburetor. In addition to further changes of detail, the BMW engineers enlarged the sump for installation in the car and cooled the engine by means of a radial fan and shrouded ducting.

The power train from the four-speed gearbox to the two rear wheels was also unusual: fixed to the gearbox output drive was something called a &quot;Hardy disc&quot;, which was a cardan joint made of rubber. On the other side of it was a cardan shaft, and finally a second Hardy disc, which in turn was located at the entrance to a chain case. A duplex chain running in an oil bath finally led to a rigid shaft, with the two rear wheels at each end. Thanks to this elaborate power transfer, the engine-gearbox-unit was free of tension in its linkage to the rear axle and well soundproofed.

In West Germany, the Isetta could be driven with a motorcycle license. The top speed of the Isetta 250 was rated as .

The first BMW Isetta rolled off the line in April 1955, and in the next eight months some 10,000 were produced.

===BMW Isetta 300===
In 1956, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany changed the regulations for motor vehicles. Class IV licences issued from that time onward could be used only to operate small motorcycles and could no longer be used to operate motor vehicles with a capacity of less than 250 cc. At the same time tax classes were restructured, with one category limit set at 300 cc. Class IV licences issued before the change in the regulations were grandfathered and allowed to be used as before.
This change in regulations encouraged BMW to revise the Isetta: In February 1956 a 300cc engine was introduced.
The engineers enlarged the single cylinder to a bore and stroke, which gave a displacement of approximately 297 cc; at the same time, they raised the compression ratio from 6.8 to 7.0:1. As a result, the engine power output rose to at 5200 rpm, and the torque rose to at 4600 rpm. The maximum speed remained at , yet there was a marked increase in flexibility, chiefly noticeable on gradients.

In October 1956, the Isetta Moto Coupé DeLuxe (sliding-window Isetta) was introduced. The bubble windows were replaced by longer, sliding side windows.
 
===BMW 600===

The BMW 600 was intended as an enlarged Isetta with more power and a more conventional four-wheel configuration.

The front end of the 600 was virtually unchanged, but the 600&#x27;s wheelbase was stretched to accommodate four seats. A conventional rear axle was added. BMW introduced the semi-trailing arm independent suspension on the 600. This suspension would be used on almost every new model for the next four decades. To deal with the increased size and weight, the 600 was fitted with the 582 cc boxer engine from the R67 motorcycle. Top speed was .

In the two years that the model was in production, 34,000 600s were made. In its price segment it was in competition with the entry-level VW Beetle. In the late 1950s, consumers wanted cars that looked like cars, and they had lost interest in economy models. Sales of the 600 were, however, aided by the energy crisis of 1956–1957.
==BMW Isetta (United Kingdom)==
In March 1957, Dunsfold Tools Ltd. signed a lease on part of the former Brighton railway works on the south coast of England with the intention of beginning production of the BMW Isetta under licence in May of that year. Shortly afterwards, Dunsfold Tools Ltd was renamed Isetta of Great Britain and the British Isetta was officially launched at the Dorchester hotel in April. The factory had no access by road, therefore components were delivered by rail and finished cars were shipped out the same way.

The British cars had right-hand drive with the door hinged from the right hand side of the car and the steering column moved across to the right as well. Right-hand drive meant that both the driver and the engine were on the same side, so a counterweight was added to the left side to compensate. Dunlop tyres were used, and Lucas electrics replaced the German Hella and Bosch components, with a different headlamp housing being used. Girling brake components replaced the ATE brake parts.

The Isetta was not popular in the UK until a three-wheeled version was introduced. Although three-wheeled vehicles offer a less stable ride, in the UK there was the advantage of being classed as three-wheeled motorcycles, which meant a lower tax class, and the requirement of only a motorcycle driving-licence. Isetta of Great Britain also continued to produce four-wheeled Isettas, but only for export to Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

In 1962, Isetta of Great Britain stopped production of the cars. Isetta engines were produced until 1964.

== Modern successors ==

=== Isetta replica kits ===
The now defunct British firm Tri-Tech, under the model name &quot;Zetta&quot;, sold a kit car or even an assembled complete BMW Isetta lookalike replica from modern parts, including Honda CN 250 cc single-cylinder water-cooled engines with automatic transmission (standard) or Kawasaki 500 GPS two-cylinder water-cooled motorcycle engines with optional manual transmission.

Some parts, new or used, were from donor vehicles. Front suspension and steering were from the Suzuki Super Carry/Bedford Rascal (later Vauxhall Rascal). Drum brakes and wheels were from Morris and the subsequent British Leyland Motor Corporation Mini. Prices ranged from c. £2650 for the kit up to c. £9450 for a complete version.

It could be legally registered for use under British laws. Tri-Tech also supplied some body parts which can be used for running non-exact restorations of BMW Isettas.

=== Possible BMW reintroduction ===
In 2009, &quot;Auto Express&quot; reported that BMW had partnered with the University of Bath in order to develop a series of three and four wheeled, rear engine, rear wheel drive city cars. This led to speculation that the Isetta badge would be returning as a competitor to small cars such as the Toyota iQ. Following this, during the development of the Megacity / BMW i brand, rumours and reports suggested that one of the upcoming cars would be named the &#x27;iSetta&#x27;, taking its name and inspiration from the classic BMW Isetta. No such car was produced, although the i brand was subsequently launched with the BMW i3 and BMW i8.

=== Durax D-Face ===

At the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, Gifu based company D Art revealed the Durax D-Face, a front entry, rear engine bubble car taking inspiration from the Isetta. The microcar was powered by a 7 kW electric motor coupled with a 3 kW petrol generator, giving a range of around 190 miles. A top speed of around 45 mph likely limited the car to city driving.

=== Microlino ===

At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Swiss entrepreneur Wim Ouboter of Micro Mobility Systems revealed the Microlino, a small electric microcar inspired by the Isetta. After being postponed, production of the vehicle commenced in 2022 with pre-orders for over 8,000 vehicles, costing EUR 12,000 each.

=== Suzhou Eagle EG6330K ===
In 2018, Chinese company Suzhou Eagle revealed the Eagle EG6330K, a low speed electric vehicle styled after the BMW Isetta and BMW 600. Primarily aimed at young people living in large cities, the car featured a 72 kWh lead acid battery giving a top speed of around 40 mph and a range of around 75 miles.

=== Artega Karo / Electric Brands Evetta ===

In 2019, German company Artega presented the Isetta-inspired Karo at the International Motor Show Germany. In 2022 Artega was acquired by German company Electric Brands. The Karo was renamed the Evetta, with plans to build commercial and non commercial versions, starting just under 20,000 EUR.

<text>Ranjit Singh (13 November 1780 – 27 June 1839) was the founder and first maharaja of the Sikh Empire, in the northwest Indian subcontinent, ruling from 1801 until his death in 1839.

Born to Maha Singh, the leader of the Sukerchakia Misl, Ranjit Singh survived smallpox in infancy but lost sight in his left eye. He fought his first battle alongside his father at the age of 10. After his father died around Ranjit&#x27;s early teenage years, he became leader of the Misl. Ranjit was the most prominent of the Sikh leaders who opposed Zaman Shah, the ruler of Durrani Empire, during his third invasion. After Zaman Shah&#x27;s retreat in 1799, he captured Lahore from the Sikh triumvirate which had been ruling it since 1765. At the age of 21, he was formally coronated at Lahore.

Before his rise, the Punjab had been fragmented into a number of warring Sikh (known as misls), Muslim and Hindu states. A large part of Punjab was under the direct Durrani control. By 1813, Ranjit Singh had successfully annexed the Sikh misls and taken over the local kingdoms; following decades saw the conquest of Durrani Afghan-ruled territories of Multan, Kashmir and Peshawar into his expanding Sikh Empire. Ranjit Singh established friendly relations with the British.

Ranjit Singh&#x27;s reign introduced reforms, modernisation, investment in infrastructure and general prosperity. His Khalsa army and government included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. His legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurdwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. He also founded the Order of the Propitious Star of Punjab in 1837. Ranjit Singh was succeeded by his son Kharak Singh after his death in 1839.

==Early years==

Ranjit Singh was born in a Sandhawalia Jat Sikh family on 13 November 1780 to Maha Singh and Raj Kaur in Gujranwala, Punjab region (present-day Punjab, Pakistan). His mother Raj Kaur was the daughter of Sidhu Jat Sikh ruler Raja Gajpat Singh of Jind. Upon his birth, he was named Buddh Singh after his ancestor who was first in line to take Amrit Sanchaar. The child&#x27;s name was changed to Ranjit (literally, &quot;victor in battle&quot;) Singh (&quot;lion&quot;) by his father to commemorate his army&#x27;s victory over the Chattha chieftain Pir Muhammad.

Ranjit Singh contracted smallpox as an infant, which resulted in the loss of sight in his left eye and a pockmarked face. He was short in stature, never schooled, and did not learn to read or write anything beyond the Gurmukhi alphabet. However, he was trained at home in horse riding, musketry and other martial arts.

At age 12, his father died. He then inherited his father&#x27;s Sukerchakia Misl estates and was raised by his mother Raj Kaur, who, along with Lakhpat Rai, also managed the estates. The first attempt on his life was made when he was 13, by Hashmat Khan, but Ranjit Singh prevailed and killed the assailant instead. At age 18, his mother died and Lakhpat Rai was assassinated, and thereon he was helped by his mother-in-law from his first marriage.

==Establishment of the Sikh Empire==

===Background===
After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire fell apart and declined in its ability to tax or govern most of the Indian subcontinent. In the northwestern region, particularly the Punjab, the creation of the Khalsa community of Sikh warriors by Guru Gobind Singh accelerated the decay and fragmentation of the Mughal power in the region. Raiding Afghans attacked the Indus river valleys but met resistance from both organised armies of the Khalsa Sikhs as well as irregular Khalsa militias based in villages. The Sikhs had appointed own &quot;zamindars&quot;, replacing the previous Muslim revenue collectors, which provided resources to feed and strengthen the warriors aligned with Sikh interests. Meanwhile, colonial traders and the East India Company had begun operations in India on its eastern and western coasts.

By the second half of the 18th century, the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and parts of north India) were a collection of fourteen small warring regions. Of the fourteen, twelve were Sikh-controlled &quot;misls&quot; (confederacies), one named Kasur (near Lahore) was Muslim controlled, and one in the southeast was led by an Englishman named George Thomas. This region constituted the fertile and productive valleys of the five rivers – Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Bias and Sutlej. The Sikh &quot;misls&quot; were all under the control of the Khalsa fraternity of Sikh warriors, but they were not united and constantly warred with each other over revenue collection, disagreements, and local priorities; however, in the event of external invasion such as from the Muslim armies of Ahmed Shah Abdali from Afghanistan, they would usually unite.

Towards the end of 18th century, the five most powerful &quot;misls&quot; were those of Sukkarchakkia, Kanhayas, Nakkais, Ahluwalias and Bhangi Sikhs. Ranjit Singh belonged to the first, and through marriage had a reliable alliance with Kanhayas and Nakkais. Among the smaller misls, some such as the Phulkias &quot;misl&quot; had switched loyalties in the late 18th century and supported the Afghan army invasion against their Khalsa brethren. The Kasur region, ruled by Muslims, always supported the Afghan invasion forces and joined them in plundering Sikh &quot;misls&quot; during the war.

==Military campaigns==

===Early conquests===

Ranjit Singh&#x27;s fame grew in 1797, at age 17, when the Durrani Shah Zaman attempted to bring Panjab into his control through his general Shahanchi Khan and 12,000 soldiers. The battle was fought in the territory that fell in Ranjit Singh&#x27;s controlled misl, whose regional knowledge and warrior expertise helped resist the invading army. This victory at the Battle of Amritsar (1798) gained him recognition. In 1798, Zaman Shah army, which Ranjit Singh did not resist. He let them enter Lahore, then encircled them with his army, blocked off all food and supplies, and burnt all crops and food sources that could have supported the Afghan army. Much of the Afghan army retreated back to Afghanistan.

In 1799, Raja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army of 25,000 Khalsa, supported by another 25,000 Khalsa led by his mother-in-law Rani Sada Kaur of Kanhaiya &quot;misl&quot;, in a joint operation attacked the region controlled by Bhangi Sikhs centered around Lahore. The rulers escaped, marking Lahore as the first major conquest of Ranjit Singh. The Sufi Muslim and Hindu population of Lahore welcomed the rule of Ranjit Singh. In 1800, the ruler of the Jammu region ceded control of his region to Ranjit Singh.

In 1801, Ranjit Singh proclaimed himself as the &quot;Maharaja of Punjab&quot;, and agreed to a formal investiture ceremony, which was carried out by Baba Sahib Singh Bedi – a descendant of Guru Nanak. On the day of his coronation, prayers were performed across mosques, temples and gurudwaras in his territories for his long life. Ranjit Singh called his rule &quot;Sarkar Khalsa&quot;, and his court &quot;Darbar Khalsa&quot;. He ordered new coins to be issued in the name of Guru Nanak named the &quot;NanakShahi&quot; (&quot;of the Emperor Nanak&quot;).

===Expansion===

In 1802, Ranjit Singh, aged 22, took Amritsar from the Bhangi Sikh &quot;misl&quot;, paid homage at the Harmandir Sahib temple, which had previously been attacked and desecrated by the invading Afghan army, and announced that he would renovate and rebuild it with marble and gold.
On 1 January 1806, Ranjit Singh signed a treaty with the British officials of the East India Company, in which he agreed that his Sikh forces would not attempt to expand south of the Sutlej River, and the Company agreed that it would not attempt to militarily cross the Sutlej River into the Sikh territory.

In 1807, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s forces attacked the Muslim-ruled principality of Kasur and, after a month of fierce fighting, defeated the Afghan chief Qutb-ud-Din, thus expanding his empire northwest towards Afghanistan. In the same year he also annexed the Sial-ruled Jhang.

The most significant encounters between the Sikhs in the command of the Maharaja and the Afghans were in 1813, 1823, 1834 and 1837. In 1813, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s general Dewan Mokham Chand led the Sikh forces against the Afghan forces of Shah Mahmud led by Fateh Khan Barakzai. The Afghans lost their stronghold of Attock in that battle.

In 1813–14, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s first attempt to expand into Kashmir was foiled by Afghan forces led by Azim Khan, due to a heavy downpour, the spread of cholera, and poor food supply to his troops. In 1819 at the Battle of Shopian, he successfully defeated the Afghan rulers and annexed Kashmir valley, stretching his rule into the north and the Jhelum valley, beyond the foothills of the Himalayas, along with a yearly revenue of Rs seventy lacs. Diwan Moti Ram was appointed governor of Kashmir.

In 1818, Darbar&#x27;s forces led by Kharak Singh and Misr Dewan Chand occupied Multan, killing Nawab Muzaffar Khan and defeating his forces, leading to the end of Afghan influence in the Punjab. The whole Bari Doab came under his rule with that conquest. With the defeat of Nawab of Mankera in 1821, whole Sind Sagar Doab came under subjugation by the Sikhs. In 1823, Yusufzai Pashtuns fought the army of Ranjit Sing north of the Kabul River.
In 1834, Mohammed Azim Khan once again marched towards Peshawar with an army of 25,000 Khattak and Yusafzai tribesmen in the name of jihad, to fight against the king. The Maharaja defeated the forces. Yar Mohammad Khan was pardoned and was reinvested as governor of Peshawar with an annual revenue of Rs one lac ten thousand to Lahore Darbar.

In 1835, the Afghans and Sikhs met again at the Standoff at the Khyber Pass, however it ended without a battle.

In 1837, the Battle of Jamrud, became the last confrontation between the Sikhs led by him and the Afghans, which displayed the extent of the western boundaries of the Sikh Empire.

On 25 November 1838, the two most powerful armies on the Indian subcontinent assembled in a grand review at Ferozepore as Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah of the Punjab brought out the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; to march alongside the sepoy troops of the East India Company and the British troops in India. In 1838, he agreed to a treaty with the British viceroy Lord Auckland to restore Shah Shoja to the Afghan throne in Kabul. In pursuance of this agreement, the British army of the Indus entered Afghanistan from the south, while Ranjit Singh&#x27;s troops went through the Khyber Pass and took part in the victory parade in Kabul.

===Extent of the rule===
The Sikh Empire, also known as the Sikh Raj and Sarkar-a-Khalsa, was in the Punjab region, the name of which means &quot;the land of the five rivers&quot;. The five rivers are the Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Jhelum, all of which are tributaries of the river Indus.

The geographical reach of the Sikh Empire under Singh included all lands north of Sutlej River, and south of the high valleys of the northwestern Himalayas. The major towns at the time included Srinagar, Attock, Peshawar, Bannu, Rawalpindi, Jammu, Gujrat, Sialkot, Kangra, Amritsar, Lahore and Multan.

Muslims formed around 70%, Hindus formed around 24%, and Sikhs formed around 6–7% of the total population living in Singh&#x27;s empire
==Administration==
===Governance===
Ranjit Singh allowed men from different religions and races to serve in his army and his government in various positions of authority. His army included a few Europeans, such as the Frenchman Jean-François Allard, and Italian Jewish Jean-Baptiste Ventura though Singh maintained a policy of refraining from recruiting Britons into his service, aware of British designs on the Indian subcontinent. Despite his recruitment policies, he did maintain a diplomatic channel with the British; in 1828, he sent gifts to George IV and in 1831, he sent a mission to Simla to confer with the British Governor General, William Bentinck, which was followed by the Ropar Meeting; while in 1838, he cooperated with them in removing the hostile Islamic Emir in Afghanistan.

===Religious policies===
As consistent with many Punjabis of that time, Ranjit Singh was a secular king and followed the Sikh path. His policies were based on respect for all communities, Hindu, Sikh and Muslim. A devoted Sikh, Ranjit Singh restored and built historic Sikh Gurdwaras – most famously, the Harmandir Sahib, and used to celebrate his victories by offering thanks at the Harmandir. He also joined the Hindus in their temples out of respect for their sentiments. The veneration of cows was promoted and cow slaughter was punishable by death under his rule. He ordered his soldiers to neither loot nor molest civilians.

He built several gurdwaras, Hindu temples and even mosques, and one in particular was Mai Moran Masjid, built at the behest of his beloved Muslim wife, Moran Sarkar. The Sikhs led by Singh never razed places of worship to the ground belonging to the enemy. However, he did convert Muslim mosques into other uses. For example, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army desecrated Lahore&#x27;s Badshahi Mosque and converted it into an ammunition store, and horse stables. Lahore&#x27;s Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was converted into &quot;Moti Mandir&quot; (Pearl Temple) by the Sikh army, and Sonehri Mosque was converted into a Sikh Gurdwara, but upon the request of Sufi Fakir (Satar Shah Bukhari), Ranjit Singh restored the latter to a mosque. Lahore&#x27;s Begum Shahi Mosque was also used as a gunpowder factory, earning it the nickname &quot;Barudkhana Wali Masjid&quot;, or &quot;Gunpowder Mosque.&quot;

Singh&#x27;s sovereignty was accepted by Afghan and Punjabi Muslims, who fought under his banner against the Afghan forces of Nadir Shah and later Azim Khan. His court was ecumenical in composition: his prime minister, Dhian Singh, was a Hindu (Dogra); his foreign minister, Fakir Azizuddin, was a Muslim; and his finance minister, Dina Nath, was also a Hindu (Brahmin). Artillery commanders such as Mian Ghausa were also Muslims. There were no forced conversions in his time. His wives Bibi Mohran, Gilbahar Begum retained their faith and so did his Hindu wives. He also employed and surrounded himself with astrologers and soothsayers in his court.

Ranjit Singh had also abolished the gurmata and provided significant patronage to the Udasi and Nirmala sect, leading to their prominence and control of Sikh religious affairs.
===Khalsa Army===


The army under Ranjit Singh was not limited to the Sikh community. The soldiers and troop officers included Sikhs, but also included Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Hindu Brahmins and people of all creeds and castes served his army, while the composition in his government also reflected a religious diversity. His army included Polish, Russian, Spanish, Prussian and French officers. In 1835, as his relationship with the British warmed up, he hired a British officer named Foulkes.

However, the Khalsa army of Ranjit Singh reflected the regional population, and as he grew his army, he dramatically increased the Rajputs and the Sikhs who became the predominant members of his army. In the Doaba region his army was composed of the Jat Sikhs, in Jammu and northern Indian hills it was Hindu Rajputs, while relatively more Muslims served his army in the Jhelum river area closer to Afghanistan than other major Panjab rivers.

====Reforms====

Ranjit Singh changed and improved the training and organisation of his army. He reorganised responsibility and set performance standards in logistical efficiency in troop deployment, manoeuvre, and marksmanship. He reformed the staffing to emphasise steady fire over cavalry and guerrilla warfare, and improved the equipment and methods of war. The military system of Ranjit Singh combined the best of both old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery. He paid the members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.

While Ranjit Singh introduced reforms in terms of training and equipment of his military, he failed to reform the old &quot;Jagirs&quot; (&quot;Ijra&quot;) system of Mughal middlemen. The &quot;Jagirs&quot; system of state revenue collection involved certain individuals with political connections or inheritance promising a tribute (&quot;nazarana&quot;) to the ruler and thereby gaining administrative control over certain villages, with the right to force collect customs, excise and land tax at inconsistent and subjective rates from the peasants and merchants; they would keep a part of collected revenue and deliver the promised tribute value to the state. These &quot;Jagirs&quot; maintained independent armed militia to extort taxes from the peasants and merchants, and the militia was prone to violence. This system of inconsistent taxation with arbitrary extortion by militia, continued the Mughal tradition of ill treatment of peasants and merchants throughout the Sikh Empire, and is evidenced by the complaints filed to Ranjit Singh by East India Company officials attempting to trade within different parts of the Sikh Empire.

According to historical records, Sunit Singh, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s reforms focused on the military that would allow new conquests, but not towards the taxation system to end abuse, nor on introducing uniform laws in his state or improving internal trade and empowering the peasants and merchants. This failure to reform the &quot;Jagirs&quot;-based taxation system and economy, in part led to a succession power struggle and a series of threats, internal divisions among Sikhs, major assassinations and coups in the Sikh Empire in the years immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh; an easy annexation of the remains of the Sikh Empire into British India followed, with the colonial officials offering the &quot;Jagirs&quot; better terms and the right to keep the system intact.

====Infrastructure investments====
Ranjit Singh ensured that Panjab manufactured and was self-sufficient in all weapons, equipment and munitions his army needed. His government invested in infrastructure in the 1800s and thereafter, established raw materials mines, cannon foundries, gunpowder and arms factories. Some of these operations were owned by the state, and others were operated by private Sikh operatives.

However, Ranjit Singh did not make major investments in other infrastructure such as irrigation canals to improve the productivity of land and roads. The prosperity in his Empire, in contrast to the Mughal-Sikh wars era, largely came from the improvement in the security situation, reduction in violence, reopened trade routes and greater freedom to conduct commerce.

===Muslim accounts===
The mid 19th-century Muslim historians, such as Shahamat Ali who experienced the Sikh Empire first hand, presented a different view on Ranjit Singh&#x27;s Empire and governance. According to Ali, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s government was despotic, and he was a mean monarch in contrast to the Mughals. The initial momentum for the Empire building in these accounts is stated to be Ranjit Singh led Khalsa army&#x27;s &quot;insatiable appetite for plunder&quot;, their desire for &quot;fresh cities to pillage&quot;, and eliminating the Mughal era &quot;revenue intercepting intermediaries between the peasant-cultivator and the treasury&quot;.

According to Ishtiaq Ahmed, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s rule led to further persecution of Muslims in Kashmir, expanding the previously selective persecution of Shia Muslims and Hindus by Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers between 1752 and 1819 before Kashmir became part of his Sikh Empire. Bikramjit Hasrat describes Ranjit Singh as a &quot;benevolent despot&quot;.
The Muslim accounts of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s rule were questioned by Sikh historians of the same era. For example, Ratan Singh Bhangu in 1841 wrote that these accounts were not accurate, and according to Anne Murphy, he remarked, &quot;when would a Musalman praise the Sikhs?&quot; In contrast, the colonial era British military officer Hugh Pearse in 1898 criticised Ranjit Singh&#x27;s rule, as one founded on &quot;violence, treachery and blood&quot;. Sohan Seetal disagrees with this account and states that Ranjit Singh had encouraged his army to respond with a &quot;tit for tat&quot; against the enemy, violence for violence, blood for blood, plunder for plunder.

===Decline===

Singh made his empire and the Sikhs a strong political force, for which he is deeply admired and revered in Sikhism. After his death, the empire failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession, and the Sikh Empire began to decline. The British and Sikh Empire fought two Anglo-Sikh wars with the second ending the reign of the Sikh Empire. Sikhism itself did not decline.

Clive Dewey has argued that the decline of the empire after Singh&#x27;s death owes much to the jagir-based economic and taxation system which he inherited from the Mughals and retained. After his death, a fight to control the tax spoils emerged, leading to a power struggle among the nobles and his family from different wives. This struggle ended with a rapid series of palace coups and assassinations of his descendants, and eventually the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British.

==Personal life==
===Wives===
In 1789, Ranjit Singh married his first wife Mehtab Kaur, the muklawa happened in 1796. She was the only daughter of Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya and his wife Sada Kaur. She was the granddaughter of Jai Singh Kanhaiya, the founder of the Kanhaiya Misl. This marriage was pre-arranged in an attempt to reconcile warring Sikh &quot;misls&quot;, Mehtab Kaur was betrothed to Ranjit Singh in 1786. The marriage, however, failed, with Mehtab Kaur never forgiving the fact that her father had been killed in battle with Ranjit Singh&#x27;s father, and she mainly resided with her mother after marriage. The separation became complete when Ranjit Singh married Datar Kaur of the Nakai Misl in 1797 and she turned into Ranjit&#x27;s most beloved wife. Mehtab Kaur had three sons, Ishar Singh who was born in 1804 and died in infancy. In 1807 she had Sher Singh and Tara Singh. According to historian Jean-Marie Lafont, she was the only one to bear the title of Maharani. She died in 1813, after suffering from failing health.

His second marriage was to, Datar Kaur (Born &quot;Raj Kaur&quot;) the youngest child and only daughter of Ran Singh Nakai, the third ruler of the Nakai Misl and his wife Karman Kaur. They were betrothed in childhood by Datar Kaur&#x27;s eldest brother, &quot;Sardar Bhagwan Singh,&quot; who briefly became the chief of the Nakai Misl, and Ranjit Singh&#x27;s father Maha Singh. They were married in 1797; this marriage was a happy one and Ranjit Singh always treated Raj Kaur with love and respect. Since Raj Kaur was also the name of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s mother, his wife was renamed Datar Kaur. In 1801, she gave birth to their son and heir apparent, Kharak Singh. Datar Kaur bore Ranjit Singh two other sons, Rattan Singh and Fateh Singh. Like his first marriage, the second marriage also brought him a strategic military alliance. Along with wisdom and all the chaste virtues of a noblewoman, Datar Kaur was exceptionally intelligent and assisted Ranjit Singh in affairs of the State. During the expedition to Multan in 1818, she was given command alongside her son, Kharak Singh. Throughout his life she remained Ranjit Singh&#x27;s favorite and for no other did he have greater respect for than Datar Kaur, who he affectionately called &quot;Mai Nakain.&quot;

Even though she was his second wife she became his principal wife and chief consort. During a hunting trip with Ranjit Singh, she fell ill and died on 20 June 1838.
Ratan Kaur and Daya Kaur were wives of Sahib Singh Bhangi of Gujrat (a &quot;misl&quot; north of Lahore, not to be confused with the state of Gujarat). After Sahib Singh&#x27;s death, Ranjit Singh took them under his protection in 1811 by marrying them via the rite of &quot;chādar andāzī&quot;, in which a cloth sheet was unfurled over each of their heads. The same with Roop Kaur, Gulab Kaur, Saman Kaur, and Lakshmi Kaur who looked after Duleep Singh when his mother Jind Kaur was exiled. Ratan Kaur had a son Multana Singh in 1819, and Daya Kaur had two sons Kashmira Singh and Pashaura Singh in 1821.

Jind Kaur, the final spouse of Ranjit Singh. Her father, Manna Singh Aulakh, extolled her virtues to Ranjit Singh, who was concerned about the frail health of his only heir Kharak Singh. The Maharaja married her in 1835 by &#x27;sending his arrow and sword to her village&#x27;. On 6 September 1838 she gave birth to Duleep Singh, who became the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire.

His other wives included, Mehtab Devi of Kangara also called Guddan or Katochan and Raj Banso, daughters of Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra.

He was also married to Rani Har Devi of Atalgarh, Rani Aso Sircar and Rani Jag Deo According to the diaries, that Duleep Singh kept towards the end of his life, these women presented the Maharaja with four daughters. Dr. Priya Atwal notes that the daughters could be adopted. Ranjit Singh was also married to Jind Bani or Jind Kulan, daughter of Muhammad Pathan from Mankera and Gul Bano, daughter of Malik Akhtar from Amritsar.

Ranjit Singh married many times, in various ceremonies, and had twenty wives. Sir Lepel Griffin, however, provides a list of just sixteen wives and their pension list. Most of his marriages were performed through chādar andāz. Some scholars note that the information on Ranjit Singh&#x27;s marriages is unclear, and there is evidence that he had many concubines. Dr. Priya Atwal presents an official list of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s thirty wives. The women married through chādar andāzī were noted as concubines and were known as the lesser title of Rani (queen). While Mehtab Kaur and Datar Kaur officially bore the title of Maharani (high queen), Datar Kaur officially became the Maharani after the death of Mehtab Kaur in 1813. Throughout her life was referred to as Sarkar Rani. After her death, the title was held by Ranjit&#x27;s youngest widow Jind Kaur. According to Khushwant Singh in an 1889 interview with the French journal &quot;Le Voltaire&quot;, his son Dalip (Duleep) Singh remarked, &quot;I am the son of one of my father&#x27;s forty-six wives.&quot; Dr. Priya Atwal notes that Ranjit Singh and his heirs entered a total of 46 marriages. But Ranjit Singh was known not to be a &quot;rash sensualist&quot; and commanded unusual respect in the eyes of others. Faqir Sayyid Vaḥiduddin states: &quot;If there was one thing in which Ranjit Singh failed to excel or even equal the average monarch of oriental history, it was the size of his harem.&quot; George Keene noted, &quot;In hundreds and in thousands the orderly crowds stream on. Not a bough is broken off a wayside tree, not a rude remark to a woman&quot;.

=== Issues ===

==== Issues of Ranjit Singh ====

* Kharak Singh (22 February 1801 – 5 November 1840) was the eldest and the favorite of Ranjit Singh from his second wife, Datar Kaur. He succeeded his father as the Maharaja.
* Ishar Singh (1804-1805) son of his first wife, Mehtab Kaur. This prince died in infancy.
* Rattan Singh (1805–1845) was born to Maharani Datar Kaur. He was granted the Jagatpur Bajaj estate as his jagir.
* Fateh Singh (1806-1811) was born to Maharani Datar Kaur.
* Sher Singh (4 December 1807 – 15 September 1843) was the elder of the twins of Mehtab Kaur. He briefly became the Maharaja of the Sikh Empire.
* Tara Singh (4 December 1807 – 1859) younger of the twins born of Mehtab Kaur.
* Multana Singh (1819–1846) son of Ratan Kaur.
* Kashmira Singh (1821–1844) son of Daya Kaur.
* Pashaura Singh (1821–1845) younger son of Daya Kaur.
* Duleep Singh (4 September 1838 – 22 October 1893), the last &quot;Maharaja&quot; of the Sikh Empire. Ranji Singh&#x27;s youngest son, the only child of Jind Kaur.
According to the pedigree table and Duleep Singh&#x27;s diaries that he kept towards the end of his life another son Fateh Singh was born to Mai Nakain, who died in infancy. According to Henry Edward only Datar Kaur and Jind Kaur&#x27;s sons are Ranjit Singh&#x27;s biological sons.

It is said that Ishar Singh was not the biological son of Mehtab Kaur and Ranjit Singh, but only procured by Mehtab Kaur and presented to Ranjit Singh who accepted him as his son. Tara Singh and Sher Singh had similar rumours, it is said that Sher Singh was the son of a chintz weaver, Nahala and Tara Singh was the son of Manki, a servant in the household of Sada Kaur. Henry Edward Fane, the nephew and aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Henry Fane, who spent several days in Ranjit Singh&#x27;s company, reported, &quot;Though reported to be the Maharaja&#x27;s son, Sher Singh&#x27;s father has never thoroughly acknowledged him, though his mother always insisted on his being so. A brother of Sher, Tara Singh by the same mother, has been even worse treated than himself, not being permitted to appear at court, and no office given him, either of profit or honour.&quot; &quot;Five Years in India&quot;, Volume 1, Henry Edward Fane, London, 1842

Multana Singh, Kashmira Singh and Pashaura Singh were sons of the two widows of Sahib Singh, Daya Kaur and Ratan Kaur, whom Ranjit Singh took under his protection and married. These sons, are said to be, not biologically born to the queens and only procured and later presented to and accepted by Ranjit Singh as his sons.

===Punishment by the Akal Takht===
In 1802, Ranjit Singh married Moran Sarkar, a Muslim nautch girl. This action, and other non-Sikh activities of the Maharaja, upset orthodox Sikhs, including the Nihangs, whose leader Akali Phula Singh was the Jathedar of the Akal Takht. When Ranjit Singh visited Amritsar, he was called outside the Akal Takht, where he was made to apologise for his mistakes. Akali Phula Singh took Ranjit Singh to a tamarind tree in front of the Akal Takht and prepared to punish him by flogging him. Then Akali Phula Singh asked the nearby Sikh pilgrims whether they approved of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s apology. The pilgrims responded with &quot;Sat Sri Akal&quot; and Ranjit Singh was released and forgiven. An alternative holds that Ranjit went to visit Moran on his arrival in Amritsar before paying his respects at Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara, which upset orthodox Sikhs and hence was punished by Akali Phula Singh. Iqbal Qaiser and Manveen Sandhu make alternative accounts of the relationship between Moran and the Maharaja; the former states they never married, while the latter states that they married. Court chronicler, Sohan Lal Suri makes no mention of Moran&#x27;s marriage to the Maharaja or coins being struck in her name. Bibi Moran spent the rest of life in Pathankot. Duleep Singh makes a list of his father&#x27;s queens which also does not mention Bibi Moran.

==Death and legacy==

===Death===
In the 1830s, Ranjit Singh suffered from numerous health complications as well as a stroke, which some historical records attribute to alcoholism and a failing liver. According to the chronicles of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s court historians and the Europeans who visited him, Ranjit Singh took to alcohol and opium, habits that intensified in the later decades of his life. He died in his sleep on 27 June 1839. According to William Dalrymple, Ranjit Singh had been washed with water from the Ganges, paid homage to the Guru Granth Sahib, and was fixated on an image of Vishnu and Lakshmi just before his death.

Four of his Hindu wives- Mehtab Devi (Guddan Sahiba), daughter of Raja Sansar Chand, Rani Har Devi, the daughter of Chaudhri Ram, a Saleria Rajput, Rani Raj Devi, daughter of Padma Rajput and Rani Rajno Kanwar, daughter of Sand Bhari along with seven Hindu concubines with royal titles committed sati by voluntarily placing themselves onto his funeral pyre as an act of devotion.

Singh is remembered for uniting Sikhs and founding the prosperous Sikh Empire. He is also remembered for his conquests and building a well-trained, self-sufficient Khalsa army to protect the empire. He amassed considerable wealth, including gaining the possession of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani of Afghanistan, which he left to Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha in 1839.

===Gurdwaras===
Perhaps Singh&#x27;s most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib, the most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, which is now known popularly as the &quot;Golden Temple&quot;. Much of the present decoration at the Harmandir Sahib, in the form of gilding and marblework, was introduced under the patronage of Singh, who also sponsored protective walls and a water supply system to strengthen security and operations related to the temple. He also directed the construction of two of the most sacred Sikh temples, being the birthplace and place of assassination of Guru Gobind Singh – Takht Sri Patna Sahib and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib, respectively – whom he much admired. The nine-storey tower of Gurdwara Baba Atal was constructed during his reign.


===Memorials and museums===
*Samadhi of Ranjit Singh in Lahore, Pakistan, marks the place where Singh was cremated, and four of his queens and seven concubines committed sati.
*On 20 August 2003, a 22-foot-tall bronze statue of Singh was installed in the Parliament of India.
*A museum at Ram Bagh Palace in Amritsar contains objects related to Singh, including arms and armour, paintings, coins, manuscripts, and jewellery. Singh had spent much time at the palace in which it is situated, where a garden was laid out in 1818.
*On 27 June 2019, a nine-foot bronze statue of Singh was unveiled at the Haveli Maharani Jindan, Lahore Fort at his 180th death anniversary. It has been vandalised several times since, specifically by members of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan.

=== Crafts ===

In 1783, Ranjit Singh established a crafts colony of Thatheras near Amritsar and encouraged skilled metal crafters from Kashmir to settle in Jandiala Guru. In the year 2014, this traditional craft of making brass and copper products was enlisted on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. The Government of Punjab is now working under Project Virasat to revive this craft.

<text>A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software, such as MUSH soft code. DSLs can be further subdivided by the kind of language, and include domain-specific &quot;markup&quot; languages, domain-specific &quot;modeling&quot; languages (more generally, specification languages), and domain-specific &quot;programming&quot; languages. Special-purpose computer languages have always existed in the computer age, but the term &quot;domain-specific language&quot; has become more popular due to the rise of domain-specific modeling. Simpler DSLs, particularly ones used by a single application, are sometimes informally called mini-languages.

The line between general-purpose languages and domain-specific languages is not always sharp, as a language may have specialized features for a particular domain but be applicable more broadly, or conversely may in principle be capable of broad application but in practice used primarily for a specific domain. For example, Perl was originally developed as a text-processing and glue language, for the same domain as AWK and shell scripts, but was mostly used as a general-purpose programming language later on. By contrast, PostScript is a Turing-complete language, and in principle can be used for any task, but in practice is narrowly used as a page description language.

==Use==
The design and use of appropriate DSLs is a key part of domain engineering, by using a language suitable to the domain at hand – this may consist of using an existing DSL or GPL, or developing a new DSL. Language-oriented programming considers the creation of special-purpose languages for expressing problems as standard part of the problem-solving process. Creating a domain-specific language (with software to support it), rather than reusing an existing language, can be worthwhile if the language allows a particular type of problem or solution to be expressed more clearly than an existing language would allow and the type of problem in question reappears sufficiently often. Pragmatically, a DSL may be specialized to a particular problem domain, a particular problem representation technique, a particular solution technique, or other aspects of a domain.

==Overview==
A domain-specific language is created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain and is not intended to be able to solve problems outside of it (although that may be technically possible). In contrast, general-purpose languages are created to solve problems in many domains. The domain can also be a business area. Some examples of business areas include:

* life insurance policies (developed internally by a large insurance enterprise)
* combat simulation
* salary calculation
* billing

A domain-specific language is somewhere between a tiny programming language and a scripting language, and is often used in a way analogous to a programming library. The boundaries between these concepts are quite blurry, much like the boundary between scripting languages and general-purpose languages.

===In design and implementation===
Domain-specific languages are languages (or often, declared syntaxes or grammars) with very specific goals in design and implementation. A domain-specific language can be one of a visual diagramming language, such as those created by the Generic Eclipse Modeling System, programmatic abstractions, such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework, or textual languages. For instance, the command line utility grep has a regular expression syntax which matches patterns in lines of text. The sed utility defines a syntax for matching and replacing regular expressions. Often, these tiny languages can be used together inside a shell to perform more complex programming tasks.

The line between domain-specific languages and scripting languages is somewhat blurred, but domain-specific languages often lack low-level functions for filesystem access, interprocess control, and other functions that characterize full-featured programming languages, scripting or otherwise. Many domain-specific languages do not compile to byte-code or executable code, but to various kinds of media objects: GraphViz exports to PostScript, GIF, JPEG, etc., where Csound compiles to audio files, and a ray-tracing domain-specific language like POV compiles to graphics files.

=== Data definition languages ===
A data definition language like SQL presents an interesting case: it can be deemed a domain-specific language because it is specific to a specific domain (in SQL&#x27;s case, accessing and managing relational databases), and is often called from another application, but SQL has more keywords and functions than many scripting languages, and is often thought of as a language in its own right, perhaps because of the prevalence of database manipulation in programming and the amount of mastery required to be an expert in the language.

Further blurring this line, many domain-specific languages have exposed APIs, and can be accessed from other programming languages without breaking the flow of execution or calling a separate process, and can thus operate as programming libraries.

===Programming tools===
Some domain-specific languages expand over time to include full-featured programming tools, which further complicates the question of whether a language is domain-specific or not. A good example is the functional language XSLT, specifically designed for transforming one XML graph into another, which has been extended since its inception to allow (particularly in its 2.0 version) for various forms of filesystem interaction, string and date manipulation, and data typing.

In model-driven engineering, many examples of domain-specific languages may be found like OCL, a language for decorating models with assertions or QVT, a domain-specific transformation language. However, languages like UML are typically general-purpose modeling languages.

To summarize, an analogy might be useful: a Very Little Language is like a knife, which can be used in thousands of different ways, from cutting food to cutting down trees. A domain-specific language is like an electric drill: it is a powerful tool with a wide variety of uses, but a specific context, namely, putting holes in things. A General Purpose Language is a complete workbench, with a variety of tools intended for performing a variety of tasks. Domain-specific languages should be used by programmers who, looking at their current workbench, realize they need a better drill and find that a particular domain-specific language provides exactly that.

==Domain-specific language topics==
===External and Embedded Domain Specific Languages===
DSLs implemented via an independent interpreter or compiler are known as &quot;External Domain Specific Languages&quot;. Well known examples include TeX or AWK. A separate category known as &quot;Embedded (or Internal) Domain Specific Languages&quot; are typically implemented within a host language as a library and tend to be limited to the syntax of the host language, though this depends on host language capabilities.

===Usage patterns===
There are several usage patterns for domain-specific languages:

* Processing with standalone tools, invoked via direct user operation, often on the command line or from a Makefile (e.g., grep for regular expression matching, sed, lex, yacc, the GraphViz toolset, etc.)
* Domain-specific languages which are implemented using programming language macro systems, and which are converted or expanded into a host general purpose language at compile-time or realtime
* As embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) also known as an internal domain-specific language, is a DSL that is implemented as a library in a &quot;host&quot; programming language. The embedded domain-specific language leverages the syntax, semantics and runtime environment (sequencing, conditionals, iteration, functions, etc.) and adds domain-specific primitives that allow programmers to use the &quot;host&quot; programming language to create programs that generate code in the &quot;target&quot; programming language. Multiple eDSLs can easily be combined into a single program and the facilities of the host language can be used to extend an existing eDSL. Other possible advantages using an eDSL are improved type safety and better IDE tooling. eDSL examples: SQLAlchemy &quot;Core&quot; an SQL eDSL in Python, jOOQ an SQL eDSL in Java, LINQ&#x27;s &quot;method syntax&quot; an SQL eDSL in C# and kotlinx.html an HTML eDSL in Kotlin.
* Domain-specific languages which are called (at runtime) from programs written in general purpose languages like C or Perl, to perform a specific function, often returning the results of operation to the &quot;host&quot; programming language for further processing; generally, an interpreter or virtual machine for the domain-specific language is embedded into the host application (e.g. format strings, a regular expression engine)
* Domain-specific languages which are embedded into user applications (e.g., macro languages within spreadsheets) and which are (1) used to execute code that is written by users of the application, (2) dynamically generated by the application, or (3) both.

Many domain-specific languages can be used in more than one way. DSL code embedded in a host language may have special syntax support, such as regexes in sed, AWK, Perl or JavaScript, or may be passed as strings.

===Design goals===
Adopting a domain-specific language approach to software engineering involves both risks and opportunities. The well-designed domain-specific language manages to find the proper balance between these.

Domain-specific languages have important design goals that contrast with those of general-purpose languages:

* Domain-specific languages are less comprehensive.
* Domain-specific languages are much more expressive in their domain.
* Domain-specific languages should exhibit minimal redundancy.

===Idioms===
In programming, idioms are methods imposed by programmers to handle common development tasks, e.g.:

* Ensure data is saved before the window is closed.
* Edit code whenever command-line parameters change because they affect program behavior.

General purpose programming languages rarely support such idioms, but domain-specific languages can describe them, e.g.:

* A script can automatically save data.
* A domain-specific language can parameterize command line input.

==Examples==
Examples of domain-specific programming languages include HTML, Logo for pencil-like drawing, Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages, MATLAB and GNU Octave for matrix programming, Mathematica, Maple and Maxima for symbolic mathematics, Specification and Description Language for reactive and distributed systems, spreadsheet formulas and macros, SQL for relational database queries, YACC grammars for creating parsers, regular expressions for specifying lexers, the Generic Eclipse Modeling System for creating diagramming languages, Csound for sound and music synthesis, and the input languages of GraphViz and GrGen, software packages used for graph layout and graph rewriting, Hashicorp Configuration Language used for Terraform and other Hashicorp tools, Puppet also has its own configuration language.

===GameMaker Language===
The GML scripting language used by GameMaker Studio is a domain-specific language targeted at novice programmers to easily be able to learn programming. While the language serves as a blend of multiple languages including Delphi, C++, and BASIC. Most of functions in that language after compiling in fact calls runtime functions written in language specific for targeted platform, so their final implementation is not visible to user. The language primarily serves to make it easy for anyone to pick up the language and develop a game, and thanks to GM runtime which handles main game loop and keeps implementation of called functions, few lines of code is required for simplest game, instead of thousands.

===ColdFusion Markup Language===
ColdFusion&#x27;s associated scripting language is another example of a domain-specific language for data-driven websites.
This scripting language is used to weave together languages and services such as Java, .NET, C++, SMS, email, email servers, http, ftp, exchange, directory services, and file systems for use in websites.

The ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) includes a set of tags that can be used in ColdFusion pages to interact with data
sources, manipulate data, and display output. CFML tag syntax is similar to HTML element syntax.

===FilterMeister===
FilterMeister is a programming environment, with a programming language that is based on C, for the specific purpose of creating Photoshop-compatible image processing filter plug-ins; FilterMeister runs as a Photoshop plug-in itself and it can load and execute scripts or compile and export them as independent plug-ins.
Although the FilterMeister language reproduces a significant portion of the C language and function library, it contains only those features which can be used within the context of Photoshop plug-ins and adds a number of specific features only useful in this specific domain.

===MediaWiki templates===
The &quot;Template&quot; feature of MediaWiki is an embedded domain-specific language whose fundamental purpose is to support the creation of page templates and the transclusion (inclusion by reference) of MediaWiki pages into other MediaWiki pages.

===Software engineering uses===
There has been much interest in domain-specific languages to improve the productivity and quality of software engineering. Domain-specific language could possibly provide a robust set of tools for efficient software engineering. Such tools are beginning to make their way into the development of critical software systems.

The Software Cost Reduction Toolkit is an example of this. The toolkit is a suite of utilities including a specification editor to create a requirements specification, a dependency graph browser to display variable dependencies, a consistency checker to catch missing cases in well-formed formulas in the specification, a model checker and a theorem prover to check program properties against the specification, and an invariant generator that automatically constructs invariants based on the requirements.

A newer development is language-oriented programming, an integrated software engineering methodology based mainly on creating, optimizing, and using domain-specific languages.

===Metacompilers===

Complementing language-oriented programming, as well as all other forms of domain-specific languages, are the class of compiler writing tools called metacompilers. A metacompiler is not only useful for generating parsers and code generators for domain-specific languages, but a metacompiler itself compiles a domain-specific metalanguage specifically designed for the domain of metaprogramming.

Besides parsing domain-specific languages, metacompilers are useful for generating a wide range of software engineering and analysis tools. The meta-compiler methodology is often found in program transformation systems.

Metacompilers that played a significant role in both computer science and the computer industry include Meta-II, and its descendant TreeMeta.

===Unreal Engine before version 4 and other games===
Unreal and Unreal Tournament unveiled a language called UnrealScript. This allowed for rapid development of modifications compared to the competitor Quake (using the Id Tech 2 engine). The Id Tech engine used standard C code meaning C had to be learned and properly applied, while UnrealScript was optimized for ease of use and efficiency. Similarly, the development of more recent games introduced their own specific languages, one more common example is Lua for scripting.

===Rules engines for policy automation===
Various business rules engines have been developed for automating policy and business rules used in both government and private industry. ILOG, Oracle Policy Automation, DTRules, Drools and others provide support for DSLs aimed to support various problem domains. DTRules goes so far as to define an interface for the use of multiple DSLs within a rule set.

The purpose of business rules engines is to define a representation of business logic in as human-readable fashion as possible. This allows both subject-matter experts and developers to work with and understand the same representation of the business logic. Most rules engines provide both an approach to simplifying the control structures for business logic (for example, using declarative rules or decision tables) coupled with alternatives to programming syntax in favor of DSLs.

===Statistical modelling languages===
Statistical modelers have developed domain-specific languages such as R (an implementation of the S language),
Bugs, Jags, and Stan. These languages provide a syntax for describing a Bayesian model and generate a method for solving it using simulation.

===Generate model and services to multiple programming Languages===
Generate object handling and services based on an Interface Description Language for a domain-specific language such as JavaScript for web applications, HTML for documentation, C++ for high-performance code, etc. This is done by cross-language frameworks such as Apache Thrift or Google Protocol Buffers.

=== Gherkin ===
Gherkin is a language designed to define test cases to check the behavior of software, without specifying how that behavior is implemented. It is meant to be read and used by non-technical users using a natural language syntax and a line-oriented design. The tests defined with Gherkin must then be implemented in a general programming language. Then, the steps in a Gherkin program acts as a syntax for method invocation accessible to non-developers.

===Other examples===
Other prominent examples of domain-specific languages include:
* Game Description Language
* OpenGL Shading Language
* Gradle
*ActionScript

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Some of the advantages:

* Domain-specific languages allow solutions to be expressed in the idiom and at the level of abstraction of the problem domain. The idea is that domain experts themselves may understand, validate, modify, and often even develop domain-specific language programs. However, this is seldom the case.
* Domain-specific languages allow validation at the domain level. As long as the language constructs are safe any sentence written with them can be considered safe.
* Domain-specific languages can help to shift the development of business information systems from traditional software developers to the typically larger group of domain-experts who (despite having less technical expertise) have a deeper knowledge of the domain.
* Domain-specific languages are easier to learn, given their limited scope.

Some of the disadvantages:

* Cost of learning a new language
* Limited applicability
* Cost of designing, implementing, and maintaining a domain-specific language as well as the tools required to develop with it (IDE)
* Finding, setting, and maintaining proper scope.
* Difficulty of balancing trade-offs between domain-specificity and general-purpose programming language constructs.
* Potential loss of processor efficiency compared with hand-coded software.
* Proliferation of similar non-standard domain-specific languages, for example, a DSL used within one insurance company versus a DSL used within another insurance company.
* Non-technical domain experts can find it hard to write or modify DSL programs by themselves.
* Increased difficulty of integrating the DSL with other components of the IT system (as compared to integrating with a general-purpose language).
* Low supply of experts in a particular DSL tends to raise labor costs.
* Harder to find code examples.

==Tools for designing domain-specific languages==
* JetBrains MPS is a tool for designing domain-specific languages. It uses projectional editing which allows overcoming the limits of language parsers and building DSL editors, such as ones with tables and diagrams. It implements language-oriented programming. MPS combines an environment for language definition, a language workbench, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for such languages.
* MontiCore is a language workbench for the efficient development of domain-specific languages. It processes an extended grammar format that defines the DSL and generates Java components for processing the DSL documents.
* Xtext is an open-source software framework for developing programming languages and domain-specific languages (DSLs). Unlike standard parser generators, Xtext generates not only a parser but also a class model for the abstract syntax tree. In addition, it provides a fully featured, customizable Eclipse-based IDE. The project was archived in April 2023.
* Racket is a cross-platform language toolchain including native code, JIT and JavaScript compiler, IDE (in addition to supporting Emacs, Vim, VSCode and others) and command line tools designed to accommodate creating both domain-specific and general purpose languages.

<text>The Samadhi of Sher-e-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh ( , ਰਣਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦੀ ਸਮਾਧੀ ; ) is a 19th-century building in Lahore, Pakistan that houses the funerary urns of the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780 – 1839). It is located adjacent the Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque, as well as the Gurdwara Dera Sahib, which marks the spot where the fifth guru of Sikhism, Guru Arjan, died. Its construction was started by his son and successor, Maharaja Kharak Singh, after the ruler&#x27;s death in 1839, and completed nine years later. It overlooks the Hazuri Bagh, built by Ranjit Singh, to its south.

==History==

Construction of the mausoleum began in August 1839 but its completion was delayed due to infighting within the Sikh Empire between different factions. Construction of the building was started by his son, Kharak Singh on the spot where he was cremated, and was completed by his youngest son, Duleep Singh in 1848. The new British-rulers of Punjab, having annexed the Sikh Empire in 1849, undertook repairs of the mausoleum, which was completed in 1851.

===Modern era===
The funerary urns were removed from the marble pavilion and were replaced by a simple slab around 1999. This was done as part of the preparations for the Khalsa Tricentenary and the visit of Sikh dignitaries from India. It has been kept well by Pakistani government. The Samadhi was damaged by an earthquake in 2005 but was repaired soon.

==Architecture==
===Building===
The building combines elements of Sikh, Hindu, and Islamic architecture. Portions of the building are believed to have been plundered from the adjacent Lahore Fort.

The building has gilded fluted domes and cupolas, and an ornate balustrade around the upper portion of the building. The front of the doorway has images of Ganesh, Devi and Brahma that are cut from red sandstone. The dome is decorated with Nāga (serpent) hood designs - the product of Hindu craftsmen that worked on the project. The wooden panels on the ceiling are decorated with stained glass work, while the walls are richly decorated with floral designs. The ceilings are decorated with glass mosaic work.

===Funerary urns===
Ranjit Singh&#x27;s ashes are contained in a marble urn in the shape of a lotus, sheltered under a marble pavilion inlaid with pietra dura, in the centre of the tomb. Surrounding him, in smaller urns, are the ashes of four Hindu sati queens and seven concubines.

==Associated monuments==
Two small monuments to the west of the main building commemorate Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s son Maharaja Kharak Singh and grandson Nau Nihal Singh, along with their wives. The building is located adjacent to Gurdwara Dera Sahib, the place of Guru Arjun&#x27;s martyrdom.
