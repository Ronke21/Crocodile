<text>The first three leaders of the Liberal Party of Canada were not chosen at a leadership convention. Alexander Mackenzie (March 1873 – April 1880) and Edward Blake (May 1880 – June 1887) were chosen by the party caucus. Wilfrid Laurier (June 1887 – February 1919) was also chosen by caucus members with the party convention of 1893 ratifying his leadership. The most recent leadership election was held in 2013.

The first Liberal leadership convention was held on August 7, 1919. Balloting continued until one candidate won a majority of votes. After the 1919 convention, a system was adopted where the candidate with the fewest votes on a given ballot is automatically dropped. More recently, any candidate with less than 5% of the vote on the first ballot is also automatically dropped. Since 1919, time has also been given between ballots for candidates to announce if they wish to withdraw and throw their support to another candidate.

The 2009 Liberal leadership election was the last one in which the leader was chosen by delegates. Future leadership elections were to be conducted according to a weighted one member, one vote system in which all party members could cast ballots but in which they would be counted so that each riding had equal weight. This system, however, has been modified in the 2012 Biennial Convention in Ottawa. In addition to the card-carrying membership, registered supporters, a newly created category of Liberal sympathisers, given the right to vote in their constituency.

==1919 leadership convention results==

The 1919 leadership convention was held in Ottawa, Ontario on August 7, 1919.

Graham withdrew while voting for the third ballot was underway. McKenzie withdrew while voting for the fourth ballot was in process. Votes were not counted for either one, and the convention proceeded directly to the fifth ballot.

==1948 leadership convention results==

The 1948 leadership convention was held in Ottawa on August 7, 1948.
==1958 leadership convention results==

The 1958 leadership convention was held in Ottawa on January 16, 1958.
==1968 leadership convention results==

The 1968 leadership convention was held in Ottawa Civic Centre in Ottawa, Ontario on April 6, 1968.

: MacEachen announced after the first ballot that he was withdrawing and would support Trudeau, but he missed the deadline to remove his name from the ballot.

==1980 leadership convention==

A leadership convention was scheduled for late March 1980, in Winnipeg, Manitoba but was cancelled due to the fall of the Progressive Conservative government on December 13, 1979 and the calling of the February 18, 1980 federal election. As a result of the snap election call, the Liberal caucus and party executive persuaded Pierre Trudeau to rescind his resignation as party leader and lead the Liberals into the election.

==1984 leadership convention results==

The 1984 leadership convention was held in Ottawa on June 16, 1984.

==2009 leadership convention results==

The 2009 leadership convention was held at the Vancouver Convention Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia from April 30-May 3, 2009.

Due to the selection of Michael Ignatieff as interim leader as a result of the 2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute and an agreement by other candidates to withdraw in favour of Ignatieff, the 2009 convention served to ratify Ignatieff&#x27;s leadership and was not a contested leadership vote. Bob Rae and Dominic LeBlanc withdrew in December 2008 (five months prior to the convention) allowing Ignatieff to become leader by default.

==2013 leadership election==

The leadership election was held on April 14, 2013. The voter turnout was 82% of all registered voters.

<text>Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics was represented by 38 events: 24 for men and 14 for women. They were held in the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium at Luzhniki (south-western part of Moscow) between July 24 and August 1. There were a total number of 959 participating athletes from 70 countries. A number of countries had boycotted the games due to the Soviet-Afghan War.

==Controversy==
Polish gold medallist pole vaulter Władysław Kozakiewicz showed an obscene bras d&#x27;honneur gesture in all four directions to the jeering Soviet public, causing an international scandal and almost losing his medal as a result. There were numerous incidents and accusations of Soviet officials using their authority to negate marks by opponents to the point that IAAF officials found the need to look over the officials&#x27; shoulders to try to keep the events fair. There were also accusations of opening stadium gates to advantage Soviet athletes, and causing other disturbances to opposing athletes.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s Jaak Uudmäe and Viktor Saneyev won the first two places in the triple jump, ahead of Brazil&#x27;s world record holder João Carlos de Oliveira. Both de Oliveira and Australia&#x27;s Ian Campbell produced long jumps, but they were declared fouls by the officials and not measured; in Campbell&#x27;s case, his longest jump was ruled a &quot;scrape foul&quot;, with his trailing leg touching the track during the jump. Campbell insisted he hadn&#x27;t scraped, and it was alleged the officials intentionally threw out his and de Oliveira&#x27;s best jumps to favor the Soviets, similarly to a number of other events. Similar allegations were made about a favorable call aiding Tatyana Kolpakova in the women&#x27;s long jump.

<doc id="531592" wikidata="Q1898382" url="?curid=531592" title="Porro prism">
<text>In optics, a Porro prism, named for its inventor Ignazio Porro, is a type of &quot;reflection prism&quot; used in optical instruments to alter the orientation of an image.

==Description==
It consists of a block of material shaped like a right geometric prism with right-angled triangular end faces. In operation, light enters the large rectangular face of the prism, undergoes total internal reflection twice from the sloped faces, and exits again through the large rectangular face. When the light enters and therefore exits the glass at normal incidence, the prism is not dispersive.

An image travelling through a Porro prism is rotated by 180° and exits in the opposite direction offset from its entry point.

While a single Porro prism can be constructed to work as well as a roof prism, it is seldom used as such. Therefore, to reduce the cost of production for a Porro prism, the edge of the roof is usually left out. Sometimes only one small window as an entrance surface and one window as exit surface are polished. The distinction between a roof prism and a Porro prism is that for the roof prism the roof edge lies in the same plane as entrance and exit beam, while for a Porro prism the (left out) roof edge is orthogonal to the plane formed by the beams. Furthermore, the roof prism has no displacement and a deviation typically between 45° and 90°, while in a single Porro prism the beam is typically deviated by 180° and displaced by a distance of at least one beam diameter.

Porro prisms can reflect light rays that are not parallel to the optical axis in such a manner that they are internally reflected off the hypotenuse of the prism. Such an abaxial ray then emerges from the prism having been reflected a third time, thus introducing non image-forming stray light and reducing contrast. Abaxial reflections can be eliminated by putting a groove or notch across the width of the hypotenuse face center of the prism, which blocks these detrimental reflections.

===Double Porro prism or Porro 1 optical system===
Porro prisms are most often used in pairs, forming a double Porro prism. A second prism rotated 90° with respect to the first, is placed such that light will traverse both prisms. The net effect of the prism system is a beam parallel to but displaced from its original direction, with the image rotated 180°. A double Porro system provides four internal reflections. Since the light is reflected an even number of times, the image&#x27;s handedness is not changed.

Double Porro prism systems are used in small optical telescopes to re-orient an inverted image (an arrangement is known as an &quot;image erection system&quot;), and especially in many binoculars where they both erect the image and provide a longer, folded distance between the objective lenses and the eyepieces. When there is an air gap between the two prism there are four glass/air transition surfaces. 

Sometimes, the two components of the double Porro system are cemented together, and the prisms may be truncated to save weight and size and reduce glass/air transition surfaces to two and hence light transmission loss.

===Porro 2 optical system===
There is also a Porro prism of the second type variant, which consists of three prisms of different shapes that can be and commonly are cemented together and also deflects the beam path four times by 90°. A double-reflecting half-cube prism is placed between two smaller, only once-reflecting half-cube prisms. The principal sections of the outer prisms are arranged at right angles to the central prism. Its advantage is that there is no vertical offset of the beam path. Porro prism of the second type optical systems are not very common and generally applied in larger and military binoculars.

====Porro–Abbe and Porro–Perger optical system variants====
Another variant of the Porro prism of the second type with the same function is the Porro–Abbe prism; a two prisms variant that reduces the lateral beam axis offset by 23% compared to a traditional double Porro prism system in binoculars.

The Porro–Abbe two prisms variant has been further developed into the Perger prism, which combines the properties of Porro and roof top prism, requiring only a small offset of the beam path and also enabling a measuring beam or an illuminated display to be reflected through the changed angle of the reflection surfaces and the cemented surface. As of 2013 Perger prisms are commercially used on a small scale in Perger–Porro prism system binoculars with integrated laser range finders.

==Binoculars==
Traditionally binoculars used a double Porro prism design, which resulted in a distinctive offset, zig-zag shape. Roof prism designs allow a simpler exterior, and are now common but they are more expensive to produce. Complicating production requirements make high-quality roof prism design binoculars relatively costly to produce compared to in optical quality equivalent Porro prism binoculars. Good-quality Porro prism design binoculars often feature about deep grooves or notches ground across the width of the hypotenuse face center of the prisms, to eliminate image quality reducing abaxial non image-forming reflections. As human eyes are ergonomically limited by their interpupillary distance the offset and separation of big (60+ mm wide) diameter objective lenses and the eyepieces becomes a practical advantage in a stereoscopic optical product.

In the early 2020s the commercial market share of Porro prism type binoculars had become the second numerous compared to other prism type optical designs.

==Use in cameras==
Most single lens reflex cameras use a roof pentaprism, and therefore have a distinctive top &quot;peak&quot;. By contrast, a Porro prism allows a much tidier design, as used in the following models:
* Olympus Pen F, FT and FV
* Olympus E-300

<doc id="531594" wikidata="Q349097" url="?curid=531594" title="Bohemond IV of Antioch">
<text>Bohemond IV of Antioch, also known as Bohemond the One-Eyed (; 11751233), was Count of Tripoli from 1187 to 1233, and Prince of Antioch from 1201 to 1216 and from 1219 to 1233. He was the younger son of Bohemond III of Antioch. The dying Raymond III of Tripoli offered his county to Bohemond&#x27;s elder brother, Raymond, but their father sent Bohemond to Tripoli in late 1187. Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria, conquered the county, save for the capital and two fortresses, in summer 1188.

Raymond died in early 1197, leaving a posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s mother, Alice, was the niece of Leo I of Cilicia who persuaded the Antiochene noblemen to acknowledge Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s right to succeed his grandfather. However, the Latin and Greek burghers proclaimed Bohemond heir to his father. After his father died in April 1201, Bohemond seized Antioch with the support of the burghers, the Knights Templar and Hospitallers, and the Italian merchants.

Bohemond made an alliance with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of Rum, who often invaded Cilicia during the following years, to prevent Leo I from attacking Antioch. Conflicts between Bohemond and the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch enabled Raymond-Roupen to seize Antioch in 1216, but Bohemond regained the principality in 1219. After Leo I&#x27;s death, Bohemond tried to secure Cilicia to his younger son, Philip, but Constantine of Baberon, who had administered Cilicia during the previous years, imprisoned Philip in 1224. Bohemond allied with Kayqubad I, sultan of Rum, but he could not prevent Philip&#x27;s murder in 1225.

== Early life ==

Bohemond was the younger son of Bohemond III of Antioch by his first wife, Orgueilleuse of Harenc. He was born around 1175. His mother was last mentioned in a charter issued in 1175. Bohemond&#x27;s widowed father married a relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, Theodora, but he repudiated her shortly after Manuel&#x27;s death in 1180. He married Sybil, an Antiochene noblewoman, described as a prostitute or sorcerer by 12th-century authors. She was a spy of Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria. Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, excommunicated Bohemond&#x27;s father for his third marriage.

== Reign ==

=== Count of Tripoli ===

The childless Raymond III of Tripoli decided to bequeath his county to his godson, Raymond, who was Bohemond&#x27;s elder brother. Bohemond III of Antioch sent Bohemond to Tripoli, because the union of Antioch and Tripoli under one monarch could jeopardize the defence of both crusader states. Raymond III of Tripoli ordered his vassals to do homage to Bohemond. The dying count, who was a member of the House of Toulouse, also prescribed that should another member of his family come from Toulouse, Bohemond should cede the County of Tripoli to him. Raymond died in late 1187. Charters issued during the first years of Bohemond&#x27;s rule imply that his elder brother was regarded a titular count of Tripoli for a while.

After Saladin conquered almost the whole Kingdom of Jerusalem in the second half of 1187, Queen Sibylla sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of her supporters. The noblemen who condemned her husband, Guy of Lusignan, for the fall of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.

Saladin released Guy of Lusignan who joined his wife. Guy, Sybilla, and their supporters left Tripoli and laid siege to Acre in August 1189. The siege was the first sign of a new Christian offensive. Richard I of England could not reoccupy Jerusalem during the Third Crusade, but he ensured the survival of the Kingdom of Jerusalem before leaving the Holy Land on 9 October 1192. Taking advantage of the crusade, Bohemond&#x27;s father made a ten-year truce with Saladin on 30 October 1192. The truce covered both Antioch and Tripoli.

Bohemond&#x27;s stepmother, Sybil, wanted to secure the succession of Antioch to her son, William. Leo, Lord of Armenian Cilicia exploited her ambitions. With her assistance, he captured and imprisoned Bohemond III in early 1194. Leo also forced Bohemond III to surrender Antioch to him, but the Latin and Greek burghers formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from seizing the town. The commune proclaimed Bohemond III&#x27;s elder son, Raymond, regent. Bohemond hurried from Tripoli to Antioch at the head of his army to help his brother, compelling the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia. Leo released their father only after Bohemond III renounced his claim to suzerainty over Cilicia.

Raymond died in early 1197. His widow, Alice, was Leo of Cilicia&#x27;s niece and heir. Bohemond III sent Alice and her posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen, to Leo, implying that he wanted to disinherit his grandson. Leo of Cilicia persuaded the papal legate, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, to visit Antioch. On the archbishop&#x27;s demand, Bohemond III declared Raymond-Roupen his heir and ordered the Antiochene noblemen to swear fealty to the boy. Raymond-Roupen was the only son of the first-born son of Bohemond III and thus heir by primogeniture, but Bohemond was Bohemond III&#x27;s closest male relative and so heir by proximity of blood.

In early 1198, Bohemond marched to Antioch and gained the support of the military orders and the Italian merchants, promising new grants to them. The commune also acknowledged his claim to rule, because the burghers feared that the Armenians&#x27; influence would increase if Raymond-Roupen succeeded his grandfather. Bohemond returned to Tripoli shortly after his claim was confirmed, because Leo of Cilicia broke into the principality to restore Bohemond III. Bohemond styled himself &quot;son of Prince Bohemond of Antioch and by the grace of God count of Tripoli&quot; to emphasize his right to inherit Antioch.

=== War of Succession ===

Bohemond hurried to Antioch when his father died in April 1201. The commune confirmed his right to rule. The military orders also supported him, but the noblemen who remained loyal to Raymond-Roupen fled to Cilicia. Leo of Cilicia besieged Antioch to assert Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s claim. Bohemond made an alliance with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of Rum, who forced the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia.

Leo tried to gain the support of the Holy See against Bohemond, promising to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the Holy See could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.

In 1203, Renoart of Nephin, Bohemond&#x27;s vassal, married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar, without his authorization. The High Court of Tripoli ordered the confiscation of Renoart&#x27;s fiefs. However, he decided to resist and gained the support of Leo and Aimery, the king of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie of Champagne. Her husband, Baldwin I, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, acknowledging the suzerainty of the Latin emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia, but she died in August.

Renoart of Nephin pillaged the countryside and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204. Bohemond lost an eye in a battle at the gates of the town. He could only crush the rebellion after Aimery died in April 1205. He captured both Nephin and Gibelcar before the end of the year, forcing Renart to flee to Cyprus. Before long, Bohemond returned to Antioch.

Bohemond had already been on bad terms with the Latin patriarch of Antioch, Peter of Angoulême. Taking advantage of a conflict between the patriarch and the papal legate, Peter Capuano, Bohemond restored the Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Antioch, Symeon II, in early 1206 or 1207. Peter of Angoulême and the papal legate were reconciled and the patriarch excommunicated Bohemond, Symeon and the commune with the approval of the Holy See. He also imposed an interdict on Antioch, but the burghers ignored his decision and visited the Greek churches.

Peter of Angoulême helped Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s supporters to return from Cilicia to Antioch in late 1207. Surprised by the coup, Bohemond sought refuge in the citadel. Although Leo of Cilicia also entered the town, Bohemond was able to muster his troops and defeat his enemies. He captured and imprisoned the Latin patriarch who refused to acknowledge him as the lawful prince. After Peter of Angoulême died of thirst, Pope Innocent III ordered Albert Avogadro, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, to excommunicate Bohemond. Bohemond continued to support the Eastern Orthodox patriarch and did not allow Peter of Ivrea, the new Latin patriarch of Antioch, to visit his see. He also debated the right of the Holy See to make a judgement about the succession in Antioch, stating that the principality was a fief of the Latin emperors of Constantinople.

The Hospitallers made raids against Hama, Homs and Latakia from their castles in Bohemond&#x27;s realms. Al-Adil I, the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus and Egypt, blamed Bohemond for the knights&#x27; actions. Al-Adil broke into the County of Tripoli, forcing Bohemond to pay a compensation in 1208 or 1209.

Az-Zahir Ghazi invaded Cilicia to prevent Leo from attacking Antioch in 1209. Cilician soldiers who tried to seize a caravan wounded the grand master of the Knights Templar Guillaume de Chartres, in a skirmish on the plains near Antioch in 1211. Their action annoyed Pope Innocent who excommunicated Leo of Cilicia. Bohemond expelled the Eastern Orthodox patriarch from Antioch, allowing Peter of Ivrea to take charge of his see. John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, sent reinforcements to Antioch to fight against the Armenians. Leo dispatched Raymond-Roupen to attack the Templars&#x27; domains in Bohemond&#x27;s principality in 1212.

A group of Assassins murdered Bohemond&#x27;s eldest son, Raymond, in 1213. At the time, the Assassins were tributaries to the Hospitallers and Bohemond suspected the Hospitallers had been involved in the murder. After Bohemond and the Templars laid siege their fortress at Khawabi, the Assassins sought assistance from Bohemond&#x27;s old ally, Az-Zahir Ghazi. Az-Zahir Ghazi appealed to Al-Adil, although they had been enemies. Their alliance forced Bohemond to lift the siege and to send an apology to Az-Zahir Ghazi.

Bohemond preferred to stay in Tripoli which caused discontent among the citizens of Antioch. Peter of Ivrea, the Hospitallers and Acharie of Sermin, who was the senechal of Antioch and head of the commune, started negotiations with Leo of Cilicia about the surrender of Antioch to Raymond-Roupen. They helped the Cilician troops to enter Antioch on 14 February 1216. The Templars abandoned the citadel without resistance and Raymond-Roupen was installed as prince.

Duke Leopold VI of Austria, who landed at Acre in late summer 1217, invited Bohemond to join the Fifth Crusade. Bohemond and his vassals marched to Acre. However, the crusade ended in failure because of the lack of a united command. Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem together with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218. Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hugh&#x27;s half-sister Melisende in Tripoli. During the same year, Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of Tripoli.

=== Conflicts ===

In 1219, a group of Antiochene noblemen rose up against Raymond-Roupen who had lost Leo of Cilicia&#x27;s support. Their leader, William Farabel, urged Bohemond to come to Antioch. Raymond-Roupen sought refuge in the citadel, but he was forced to leave Antioch. He entrusted the citadel to the Hospitallers. Bohemond hurried to Antioch and seized the principality. The Hospitallers abandoned the citadel without resistance.

Before long, Bohemond granted Jabala (which was still to be conquered) to the Templars although Raymond-Roupen had promised the town to the Hospitallers. The papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, brokered an agreement between the military orders, dividing the town between them. However, Bohemond remained hostile to the Hospitallers. After he confiscated their property in Antioch, Pelagius excommunicated him.

Constantine of Baberon, the regent for Isabella of Cilicia, offered her hand to Bohemond&#x27;s son, Philip, because he needed Bohemond&#x27;s assistance against Kayqubad I, Sultan of Rum. Bohemond accepted the offer and his son married Isabella in June 1222. Bohemond and Philip repelled a Seldjuq attack against Cilicia. Philip&#x27;s blatant favoritism towards his Frankish retainers enabled Constantine of Baberon to hatch a plot against him. Philip and his supporters were captured and imprisoned at the end of 1224. Bohemond tried to ensure his son&#x27;s liberation through negotiations. He appealed to Pope Honorius III, but the pope confirmed his excommunication and forbade the Templars to assist him. Bohemond persuaded Kayqubad I to invade Cilicia. Although Bohemond&#x27;s son had already been poisoned, Constantine of Baberon promised that Philip would be released if Bohemond come to Cilicia. Shortly after Bohemond&#x27;s departure, Shihab ad-Din Toghrul, atabeg of Aleppo, broke into the Principality of Antioch. After learning of his son&#x27;s death and Toghrul&#x27;s invasion, Bohemond hurried back.

The Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, summoned the Christian rulers of Syria and the Holy Land to Cyprus. Bohemond joined him while Frederick was marching from Limassol to Nicosia in August 1228. Frederick demanded an oath of fealty for Antioch and Tripoli from Bohemond, but Bohemond feigned a nervous breakdown and returned to Nephin. Bohemond again met Frederick in Acre in 1229, but Bohemond&#x27;s realms were not included in the peace treaty between Frederick and Al-Kamil, sultan of Egypt, on 18 February 1229.

At the Hospitallers&#x27; request, Pope Gregory IX repeated the excommunication of Bohemond in March 1230. He authorized Gerald of Lausanne, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to lift the ban if Bohemond agreed to make peace with the Hospitallers. With the mediation of Gerald and the Ibelins, Bohemond and the Hospitallers made a treaty which was signed on 26 October 1231. Bohemond confirmed the Hospitallers&#x27; right to hold Jabala and a nearby fortress and granted them money fiefs in both Tripoli and Antioch. The knights renounced the privileges that Raymond-Roupen had granted to them. Before long, Gerald of Lausanne lifted the excommunication and sent the treaty to Rome to be confirmed by the Holy See.

John of Ibelin, who was the leader of Emperor Frederick&#x27;s opponents in the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus, tried to convince Bohemond to support their cause. John sent his son, Balian, to Tripoli to negotiate with Bohemond, but the elderly Bohemond remained neutral in the conflict. Bohemond died in March 1233, a few weeks before the pope&#x27;s confirmation of his treaty with the Hospitallers came to Tripoli. He was regarded as a great jurist by his contemporaries.

==Family==




 

Bohemond&#x27;s first wife, Plaisance, was the daughter of Hugh III Embriaco, Lord of Jabala, and Stephanie of Milly. The marriage secured Bohemond&#x27;s position in the County of Tripoli. Raymond, the eldest son of Bohemond and Plaisance, was murdered at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa in 1213 at the age of 18. Bohemond was succeeded by his second son, Bohemond, in both Antioch and Tripoli. Bohemond&#x27;s and Plaisance&#x27;s third son, Philip, who was the first husband of Isabella of Cilicia, ruled the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1222 and 1224. He died in prison. Bohemond&#x27;s youngest son, Henry, married Isabella of Cyprus; their son, Hugh, inherited Cyprus in 1267 and the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1268.

Bohemond&#x27;s second wife, Melisende, was the youngest daughter of King Aimery of Cyprus and Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem. Their daughter, Maria, laid claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem against her nephew, Hugh, in 1268. She died after 1307.

<doc id="531611" wikidata="Q272002" url="?curid=531611" title="Foodborne illness">
<text>Foodborne illness (also known as foodborne disease and food poisoning) is any illness resulting from the contamination of food by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites, as well as prions (the agents of mad cow disease), and toxins such as aflatoxins in peanuts, poisonous mushrooms, and various species of beans that have not been boiled for at least 10 minutes.

Symptoms vary depending on the cause. They often include vomiting, fever, and aches, and may include diarrhea. Bouts of vomiting can be repeated with an extended delay in between. This is because even if infected food was eliminated from the stomach in the first bout, microbes, like bacteria (if applicable), can pass through the stomach into the intestine and begin to multiply. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine.

For contaminants requiring an incubation period, symptoms may not manifest for hours to days, depending on the cause and on the quantity of consumption. Longer incubation periods tend to cause those affected to not associate the symptoms with the item consumed, so they may misattribute the symptoms to gastroenteritis, for example.

==Causes==
Foodborne disease can be caused by a number of bacteria, such as &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot;, and chemicals, such as pesticides, medicines, and natural toxic substances, such as vomitoxin, poisonous mushrooms, or reef fish.

Foodborne illness usually arises from improper handling, preparation, or food storage. Good hygiene practices before, during, and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand-washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of foodborne illness. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause foodborne illness is known as food safety.

===Bacteria===
Bacteria are a common cause of foodborne illness. In 2000, the United Kingdom reported the individual bacteria involved as the following: &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; 77.3%, &quot;Salmonella&quot; 20.9%, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O157:H7 1.4%, and all others less than 0.56%.

In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more prevalent because few places had the capability to test for norovirus and no active surveillance was being done for this particular agent. Toxins from bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. As a result, symptoms associated with intoxication are usually not seen until 12–72 hours or more after eating contaminated food. However, in some cases, such as Staphylococcal food poisoning, the onset of illness can be as soon as 30 minutes after ingesting contaminated food.
A 2022 study concluded that washing uncooked chicken could increase the risk of pathogen transfer, and that specific washing conditions can decrease the risk of transfer.

Most common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:
* &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; which can lead to secondary Guillain–Barré syndrome and periodontitis
* &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, the &quot;cafeteria germ&quot;
* &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp. – its &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; infection is caused by consumption of eggs or poultry that are not adequately cooked or by other interactive human-animal pathogens
* &quot;Escherichia coli O157:H7&quot; enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) which can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome

Other common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:
* &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, other virulence properties, such as enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC or EAgEC)
* &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;
* &quot;Shigella&quot; spp.
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus&quot;
* &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, including O1 and non-O1
* &quot;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot;
* &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot;
* &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; and &quot;Yersinia pseudotuberculosis&quot;

Less common bacterial agents:
* &quot;Brucella&quot; spp.
* &quot;Corynebacterium ulcerans&quot;
* &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; or Q fever
* &quot;Plesiomonas shigelloides&quot;

==== Enterotoxins ====
In addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by enterotoxins (exotoxins targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptom onset varies with the toxin but may be rapid in onset, as in the case of enterotoxins of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; in which symptoms appear in one to six hours. This causes intense vomiting including or not including diarrhea (resulting in staphylococcal enteritis), and staphylococcal enterotoxins (most commonly staphylococcal enterotoxin A but also including staphylococcal enterotoxin B) are the most commonly reported enterotoxins although cases of poisoning are likely underestimated. It occurs mainly in cooked and processed foods due to competition with other biota in raw foods, and humans are the main cause of contamination as a substantial percentage of humans are persistent carriers of &quot;S. aureus&quot;. The CDC has estimated about 240,000 cases per year in the United States.
* &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;
* &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;
* &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;

The rare but potentially deadly disease botulism occurs when the anaerobic bacterium &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; grows in improperly canned low-acid foods and produces botulin, a powerful paralytic toxin.

&quot;Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis&quot;, certain species of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and &quot;Vibrio&quot;, and some other bacteria, produce the lethal tetrodotoxin, which is present in the tissues of some living animal species rather than being a product of decomposition.

====Emerging foodborne pathogens====
* &quot;Aeromonas hydrophila&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas caviae&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas sobria&quot;
Scandinavian outbreaks of &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; have recently increased to an annual basis, connected to the non-canonical contamination of pre-washed salad.

====Preventing bacterial food poisoning====
Governments have the primary mandate of ensuring safe food for all, however all actors in the food chain are responsible to ensure only safe food reaches the consumer, thus preventing foodborne illnesses. This is achieved through the implementation of strict hygiene rules and a public veterinary and phytosanitary service that monitors animal products throughout the food chain, from farming to delivery in shops and restaurants. This regulation includes:
* traceability: the origin of the ingredients (farm of origin, identification of the crop or animal) and where and when it has been processed must be known in the final product; in this way, the origin of the disease can be traced and resolved (and possibly penalized), and the final products can be removed from sale if a problem is detected;
* enforcement of hygiene procedures such as HACCP and the &quot;cold chain&quot;;
* power of control and of law enforcement of veterinarians.

In August 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved phage therapy which involves spraying meat with viruses that infect bacteria, and thus preventing infection. This has raised concerns because without mandatory labeling, consumers would not know that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray.

At home, prevention mainly consists of good food safety practices. Many forms of bacterial poisoning can be prevented by cooking food sufficiently, and either eating it quickly or refrigerating it effectively. Many toxins, however, are not destroyed by heat treatment.

Techniques that help prevent food borne illness in the kitchen are hand washing, rinsing produce, preventing cross-contamination, proper storage, and maintaining cooking temperatures. In general, freezing or refrigerating prevents virtually all bacteria from growing, and heating food sufficiently kills parasites, viruses, and most bacteria. Bacteria grow most rapidly at the range of temperatures between , called the &quot;danger zone&quot;. Storing food below or above the &quot;danger zone&quot; can effectively limit the production of toxins. For storing leftovers, the food must be put in shallow containers
for quick cooling and must be refrigerated within two hours. When food is reheated, it must reach an internal temperature of or until hot or steaming to kill bacteria.

=== Mycotoxins and alimentary mycotoxicoses ===
The term alimentary mycotoxicosis refers to the effect of poisoning by mycotoxins through food consumption. The term mycotoxin is usually reserved for the toxic chemical compounds naturally produced by fungi that readily colonize crops under given temperature and moisture conditions. Mycotoxins can have important effects on human and animal health. For example, an outbreak which occurred in the UK during 1960 caused the death of 100,000 turkeys which had consumed aflatoxin-contaminated peanut meal. In the USSR in World War II, 5,000 people died due to alimentary toxic aleukia (ALA). In Kenya, mycotoxins led to the death of 125 people in 2004, after consumption of contaminated grains. In animals, mycotoxicosis targets organ systems such as liver and digestive system. Other effects can include reduced productivity and suppression of the immune system, thus pre-disposing the animals to other secondary infections.
The common foodborne Mycotoxins include:
* Aflatoxins – originating from &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;. They are frequently found in tree nuts, peanuts, maize, sorghum and other oilseeds, including corn and cottonseeds. The pronounced forms of aflatoxins are those of B1, B2, G1, and G2, amongst which Aflatoxin B1 predominantly targets the liver, which will result in necrosis, cirrhosis, and carcinoma. Other forms of aflatoxins exist as metabolites such as Aflatoxin M1. In the US, the acceptable level of total aflatoxins in foods is less than 20&quot; &quot;μg/kg, except for Aflatoxin M1 in milk, which should be less than 0.5&quot; &quot;μg/kg The official document can be found at FDA&#x27;s website. The European union has more stringent standards, set at 10 μg/kg in cereals and cereal products. These references are also adopted in other countries. 
* Altertoxins – are those of alternariol (AOH), alternariol methyl ether (AME), altenuene (ALT), altertoxin-1 (ATX-1), tenuazonic acid (TeA), and radicinin (RAD), originating from &quot;Alternaria&quot; spp. Some of the toxins can be present in sorghum, ragi, wheat and tomatoes. Some research has shown that the toxins can be easily cross-contaminated between grain commodities, suggesting that manufacturing and storage of grain commodities is a critical practice.
* Citrinin
* Citreoviridin
* Cyclopiazonic acid
* Cytochalasins
* Ergot alkaloids / ergopeptine alkaloids – ergotamine
* Fumonisins – Crop corn can be easily contaminated by the fungi &quot;Fusarium moniliforme&quot;, and its fumonisin B1 will cause leukoencephalomalacia (LEM) in horses, pulmonary edema syndrome (PES) in pigs, liver cancer in rats and esophageal cancer in humans. For human and animal health, both the FDA and the EC have regulated the content levels of toxins in food and animal feed.
* Fusaric acid
* Fusarochromanone
* Kojic acid
* Lolitrem alkaloids
* Moniliformin
* 3-Nitropropionic acid
* Nivalenol
* Ochratoxins – In Australia, The Limit of Reporting (LOR) level for ochratoxin A (OTA) analyses in 20th Australian Total Diet Survey was 1 μg/kg, whereas the EC restricts the content of OTA to 5 μg/kg in cereal commodities, 3 μg/kg in processed products and 10 μg/kg in dried vine fruits.
* Oosporeine
* Patulin – Currently, this toxin has been advisably regulated on fruit products. The EC and the FDA have limited it to under 50 μg/kg for fruit juice and fruit nectar, while limits of 25 μg/kg for solid-contained fruit products and 10 μg/kg for baby foods were specified by the EC.
* Phomopsins
* Sporidesmin A
* Sterigmatocystin
* Tremorgenic mycotoxins – Five of them have been reported to be associated with molds found in fermented meats. These are fumitremorgen B, paxilline, penitrem A, verrucosidin, and verruculogen.
* Trichothecenes – sourced from &quot;Cephalosporium&quot;, &quot;Fusarium&quot;, &quot;Myrothecium&quot;, &quot;Stachybotrys&quot;, and &quot;Trichoderma&quot;. The toxins are usually found in molded maize, wheat, corn, peanuts and rice, or animal feed of hay and straw. Four trichothecenes, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), and deoxynivalenol (DON) have been most commonly encountered by humans and animals. The consequences of oral intake of, or dermal exposure to, the toxins will result in alimentary toxic aleukia, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and/or skin irritation. In 1993, the FDA issued a document for the content limits of DON in food and animal feed at an advisory level. In 2003, US published a patent that is very promising for farmers to produce a trichothecene-resistant crop.
* Zearalenone
* Zearalenols

===Viruses===
Viral infections make up perhaps one third of cases of food poisoning in developed countries. In the US, more than 50% of cases are viral and noroviruses are the most common foodborne illness, causing 57% of outbreaks in 2004. Foodborne viral infection are usually of intermediate (1–3 days) incubation period, causing illnesses which are self-limited in otherwise healthy individuals; they are similar to the bacterial forms described above.
* Enterovirus
* Hepatitis A is distinguished from other viral causes by its prolonged (2–6 week) incubation period and its ability to spread beyond the stomach and intestines into the liver. It often results in jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, but rarely leads to chronic liver dysfunction. The virus has been found to cause infection due to the consumption of fresh-cut produce which has fecal contamination.
* Hepatitis E
* Norovirus
* Rotavirus 

===Parasites===
Most foodborne parasites are zoonoses.
* Platyhelminthes:
** &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; sp.
** &quot;Nanophyetus&quot; sp.
** &quot;Taenia saginata&quot;
** &quot;Taenia solium&quot;
** &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;
** See also: Tapeworm and Flatworm
* Nematode:
** &quot;Anisakis&quot; sp.
** &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;
** &quot;Eustrongylides&quot; sp.
** &quot;Toxocara&quot;
** &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;
** &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;
* Protozoa:
** &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; and other free-living amoebae
** &quot;Cryptosporidiosis&quot;
** &quot;Cyclospora cayetanensis&quot;
** &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;
** &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;
** &quot;Sarcocystis hominis&quot;
** &quot;Sarcocystis suihominis&quot;
** &quot;Toxoplasma&quot;

===Natural toxins===
Several foods can naturally contain toxins, many of which are not produced by bacteria. Plants in particular may be toxic; animals which are naturally poisonous to eat are rare. In evolutionary terms, animals can escape being eaten by fleeing; plants can use only passive defenses such as poisons and distasteful substances, for example capsaicin in chili peppers and pungent sulfur compounds in garlic and onions. Most animal poisons are not synthesised by the animal, but acquired by eating poisonous plants to which the animal is immune, or by bacterial action.
* Alkaloids
* Ciguatera poisoning
* Grayanotoxin (honey intoxication)
* Hormones from the thyroid glands of slaughtered animals (especially triiodothyronine in cases of &quot;hamburger thyrotoxicosis&quot; or &quot;alimentary thyrotoxicosis&quot;)
* Mushroom toxins
* Phytohaemagglutinin (red kidney bean poisoning; destroyed by boiling)
* Pyrrolizidine alkaloids
* Shellfish toxin, including paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera fish poisoning
* Scombrotoxin
* Solanine (green potato poisoning)
* Tetrodotoxin (fugu fish poisoning)

Some plants contain substances which are toxic in large doses, but have therapeutic properties in appropriate dosages.
* Foxglove contains cardiac glycosides.
* Poisonous hemlock (conium) has medicinal uses. 

===Other pathogenic agents===
* Prions, resulting in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) and its variant (vCJD)

===&quot;Ptomaine poisoning&quot; misconception ===
Ptomaine poisoning was a myth that persisted in the public consciousness, in newspaper headlines, and legal cases as an official diagnosis, decades after it had been scientifically disproven in the 1910s.

In the 19th century, the Italian chemist Francesco Selmi, of Bologna, introduced the generic name &quot;&quot; (from Greek &quot;ptōma&quot;, &quot;fall, fallen body, corpse&quot;) for alkaloids found in decaying animal and vegetable matter, especially (as reflected in their names) putrescine and cadaverine. The 1892 &quot;Merck&#x27;s Bulletin&quot; stated, &quot;We name such products of bacterial origin ptomaines; and the special alkaloid produced by the comma bacillus is variously named Cadaverine, Putrescine, etc.&quot; while &quot;The Lancet&quot; stated, &quot;The chemical ferments produced in the system, the... ptomaines which may exercise so disastrous an influence.&quot; It is now known that the &quot;disastrous... influence&quot; is due to the direct action of bacteria and only slightly due to the alkaloids. Thus, the use of the phrase &quot;ptomaine poisoning&quot; is now largely obsolete.

At a Communist political convention in Massillon, Ohio, and aboard a cruise ship in Washington, D.C., hundreds of people were sickened in separate incidents by tainted potato salad, during a single week in 1932, drawing national attention to the dangers of so-called &quot;ptomaine poisoning&quot; in the pages of the American news weekly, &quot;Time.&quot; In 1944, another newspaper article reported that over 150 people in Chicago were hospitalized with ptomaine poisoning, apparently from rice pudding served by a restaurant chain.

==Mechanism==

===Incubation period===
The delay between the consumption of contaminated food and the appearance of the first symptoms of illness is called the incubation period. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely months or even years, such as in the case of listeriosis or bovine spongiform encephalopathy), depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within one to six hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.

The long incubation period of many foodborne illnesses tends to cause those affected to attribute their symptoms to gastroenteritis.

During the incubation period, microbes pass through the stomach into the intestine, attach to the cells lining the intestinal walls, and begin to multiply there. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a toxin that is absorbed into the bloodstream, and some can directly invade the deeper body tissues. The symptoms produced depend on the type of microbe.

===Infectious dose===
The infectious dose is the amount of agent that must be consumed to give rise to symptoms of foodborne illness, and varies according to the agent and the consumer&#x27;s age and overall health. Pathogens vary in minimum infectious dose; for example, &quot;Shigella sonnei&quot; has a low estimated minimum dose of &lt; 500 colony-forming units (CFU) while &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; has a relatively high estimate.

In the case of &quot;Salmonella&quot; a relatively large inoculum of 1&quot; &quot;million to 1&quot; &quot;billion organisms is necessary to produce symptoms in healthy human volunteers, as &quot;Salmonellae&quot; are very sensitive to acid. An unusually high stomach pH level (low acidity) greatly reduces the number of bacteria required to cause symptoms by a factor of between 10 and 100.

===Gut microbiota unaccustomed to endemic organisms===
Foodborne illness often occurs as travelers&#x27; diarrhea in persons whose gut microbiota is unaccustomed to organisms endemic to the visited region. This effect of microbiologic naïveté is compounded by any food safety lapses in the food&#x27;s preparation.

==Epidemiology==
Asymptomatic subclinical infection may help spread these diseases, particularly &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Enterobacter, Vibrio cholerae,&quot; and &quot;Yersinia&quot;. For example, as of 1984 it was estimated that in the United States, 200,000 people were asymptomatic carriers of &quot;Salmonella&quot;.

===Infants===

Globally, infants are a group that is especially vulnerable to foodborne disease. The World Health Organization has issued recommendations for the preparation, use and storage of prepared formulas. Breastfeeding remains the best preventive measure for protection from foodborne infections in infants.

===United States===

A CDC report for the period 2017–2019 found that 41% of outbreaks at restaurants were caused by a sick employee. Contributory factors identified included lack of written policy compliance with FDA recommendations for identifying red-flag symptoms, glove use, and hand washing; lack of paid sick leave at the majority of establishments; and social pressure to come to work even while sick. The remaining outbreaks had a variety of causes, including inadequate cooking, improper temperature, and cross-contamination.

In the United States, using FoodNet data from 2000 to 2007, the CDC estimated there were 47.8&quot; &quot;million foodborne illnesses per year (16,000 cases for 100,000 inhabitants) with 9.4&quot; &quot;million of these caused by 31 known identified pathogens.
* 127,839 were hospitalized (43 per 100,000 inhabitants per year).
* 3,037 people died (1.0 per 100,000 inhabitants per year).


=== United Kingdom ===

According to a 2012 report from the Food Standards Agency, there were around a million cases of foodborne illness per year (1,580 cases for 100,000 inhabitants).
* 20,000 people were hospitalised (32 per 100,000 inhabitants);
* 500 died (0.80 per 100,000 inhabitants).

===France===
This data pertains to reported medical cases of 23 specific pathogens in the 1990s, as opposed to total population estimates of all foodborne illness for the United States.

In France, for 735,590 to 769,615 cases of infection identified as being with the 23 specific pathogens, 238,836 to 269,085 were estimated to have been contracted from food:
* between 12,995 and 22,030 people were hospitalized (10,188 to 17,771 estimated to have contracted their infections from food);
* between 306 and 797 people died (228 to 691 estimated to have contracted their infections from food).


===Australia===

A study by the Australian National University published in 2022 for Food Standards Australia New Zealand estimated there are 4.67 million cases of food poisoning in Australia each year that result in 47,900 hospitalisations, 38 deaths and a cost to the economy of $2.1 billion.

A previous study using different methodology and published in November 2014, found in 2010 that there were an estimated 4.1 million cases of foodborne gastroenteritis acquired in Australia on average each year, along with 5,140 cases of non-gastrointestinal illness.

The main causes were norovirus, pathogenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot; spp. and non-typhoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp., although the causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates to an average of approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.

A main aim of this study was to compare if foodborne illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.

This study replaces a previous estimate of 5.4 million cases of foodborne illness in Australia every year, causing:
* 18,000 hospitalizations
* 120 deaths (0.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants)
* 2.1 million lost days off work
* 1.2 million doctor consultations
* 300,000 prescriptions for antibiotics.

Most foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia have been linked to raw or minimally cooked eggs or poultry. The Australian Food Safety Information Council estimates that one third of cases of food poisoning occur in the home.

===Outbreaks===

The vast majority of reported cases of foodborne illness occur as individual or sporadic cases. The origin of most sporadic cases is undetermined. In the United States, where people eat outside the home frequently, 58% of cases originate from commercial food facilities (2004 FoodNet data). An outbreak is defined as occurring when two or more people experience similar illness after consuming food from a common source.

Often, a combination of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left at room temperature for many hours, allowing bacteria to multiply which is compounded by inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.

Outbreaks are usually identified when those affected know each other. Outbreaks can also be identified by public health staff when there are unexpected increases in laboratory results for certain strains of bacteria. Outbreak detection and investigation in the United States is primarily handled by local health jurisdictions and is inconsistent from district to district. It is estimated that 1–2% of outbreaks are detected.

==Society and culture==

===United Kingdom===

In Aberdeen, in 1964, a large-scale (&gt;400 cases) outbreak of typhoid occurred, caused by contaminated corned beef which had been imported from Argentina. The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the Plate estuary was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. That meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, and a lack of machinery-cleaning led to the spreading of the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. Those meats were eaten by people in Aberdeen who then became ill.

Serious outbreaks of foodborne illness since the 1970s prompted key changes in UK food safety law. The outbreaks included the deaths of 19 patients in the Stanley Royd Hospital outbreak and the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) outbreak identified in the 1980s. The deaths of 21 people in the 1996 Wishaw outbreak of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157 was a precursor to the establishment of the Food Standards Agency which, according to Tony Blair in the 1998 white paper &quot;A Force for Change&quot; Cm 3830, &quot;would be powerful, open and dedicated to the interests of consumers&quot;.

In May 2015, for the second year running, England&#x27;s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to &quot;The Chicken Challenge&quot;. The focus was on the handling of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the high levels of food poisoning from the &quot;campylobacter&quot; bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (TV cookery programmes) and advertisement. She points to the examples set by Scandinavian societies.

===United States===

In 2001, the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the United States Department of Agriculture to require meat packers to remove spinal cords before processing cattle carcasses for human consumption, a measure designed to lessen the risk of infection by variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. The petition was supported by the American Public Health Association, the Consumer Federation of America, the Government Accountability Project, the National Consumers League, and Safe Tables Our Priority.

None of the US Department of Health and Human Services targets regarding incidence of foodborne infections were reached in 2007.

A report issued in June 2018 by NBC&#x27;s Minneapolis station using research by both the CDC and the Minnesota Department of Health concluded that foodborne illness is on the rise in the U.S.

=== India ===
In India, &quot;Entamoeba&quot; is the most common cause of food illness, followed by &quot;Campylobacter&quot; bacteria, &quot;Salmonella&quot; bacteria, &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria, and norovirus. According to statistics, food poisoning was the second most common cause of infectious disease outbreak in India in 2017. The numbers of outbreaks have increased from 50 in 2008 to 242 in 2017. 

===Organizations===

The World Health Organization Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) provides scientific advice for organizations and the public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2&quot; &quot;million people annually, most of whom are children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.

===International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)===

The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is a joint program of the WHO and FAO. INFOSAN has been connecting national authorities from around the globe since 2004, with the goal of preventing the international spread of contaminated food and foodborne disease and strengthening food safety systems globally. This is done by:

# Promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events;
# Sharing information on important food safety issues of global interest;
# Promoting partnership and collaboration between countries; and
# Helping countries strengthen their capacity to manage food safety risks.

Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is restricted to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points in each of the respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members. The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; foodborne disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the farm-to-table continuum.

===Prioritisation of foodborne pathogens===

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and The World Health Organization have published a global ranking of foodborne parasites using a multicriteria ranking tool concluding that &quot;Taenia solium&quot; was the most relevant, followed by &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot;, &quot;Echinococcus multilocularis&quot;, and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. The same method was used regionally to rank the most important foodborne parasites in Europe ranking &quot;Echinococcus multilocularis&quot; of highest relevance, followed by &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;.

===Regulatory steps===

Food may be contaminated during all stages of food production and retailing. In order to prevent viral contamination, regulatory authorities in Europe have enacted several measures:
* European Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of November 15, 2005
* European Committee for Standardization (CEN): Standard method for the detection of norovirus and hepatitis A virus in food products (shellfish, fruits and vegetables, surfaces and bottled water)
* CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH): Guideline for the application of general principles of food hygiene for the control of viruses in food

<text>Bohemond V of Antioch (1199 − 17 January 1252) was ruler of the Principality of Antioch, a Crusader state, from 1233 to his death. He was simultaneously Count of Tripoli.
==Life==
Bohemond V was the son of Bohemond IV of Antioch and Plaisance of Gibelet. Like his father before him, Bohemond had a notorious dislike for the Knights Hospitaller and the neighbouring Kingdom of Armenia, preferring an alliance with the Knights Templar. Peace with Armenia was assured only shortly before his death, with the mediation of Louis IX of France.

In 1225, Bohemond was married to Cypriote queen dowager Alice of Champagne. Their childless marriage ended in annulment after 5 July 1227. His second marriage was in 1235 to Lucienne of Segni, a great-niece of Pope Innocent III. He had two children: 
* Plaisance of Antioch, a daughter who became the third wife of King Henry I of Cyprus in 1251
* Bohemond VI of Antioch

Bohemond V died in January 1252. Since his son and successor was only 15 at the time, he succeeded under the regency of the dowager princess, Lucienne. However, she never left Tripoli, and instead handed over the government of the principality to her Roman relatives. This made her unpopular, so the young Bohemond VI gained the approval of King Louis IX of France, who was on Crusade at the time, to get permission from Pope Innocent IV to come of age a few months early.

<text>In Norse cosmology, svartálfar (O.N. &quot;black elves&quot;, &quot;swarthy elves&quot;, sing. svartálfr), also called myrkálfar (&quot;dark elves&quot;, &quot;dusky elves&quot;, &quot;murky elves&quot;, sing. myrkálfr), are beings who dwell in Svartálfheim (&quot;Svartálf[a]heimr&quot;, &quot;home of the black-elves&quot;). Both the svartálfar and Svartálfaheimr are primarily attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have noted that the svartálfar appear to be synonymous with the dwarfs and potentially also the dökkálfar (&quot;dark elves&quot;). As dwarfs, the home of the svartálfar could possibly be another description for &quot;Niðavellir&quot; (&quot;dark fields&quot;).

==Attestations==
The &quot;svartálfar&quot; are almost only attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; (the word does appear in &quot;Ektors saga ok kappa hans&quot;, but is presumably borrowed from the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;). The &quot;svartálfar&quot; mentioned in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; 35 are the Sons of Ivaldi, whom Loki engages to craft replacement hair for Sif, wife of the god Thor, after Loki mischievously sheared off her golden . Ivaldi is often glossed as being a dwarf.

&quot;Svartálfaheimr&quot; (&quot;world of black-elves&quot;) appears in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; twice, in each case as the place where certain dwarfs can be found to be living: In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; 33, the &quot;world of black-elves&quot; is where the dwarfs are sought by the gods to craft the fetter Gleipnir to bind the wolf Fenrir. And in &quot;Skáldskaparmál,&quot; 39, the &quot;world of black-elves&quot; is where Loki encounters the dwarf Andvari.

==Theories and interpretations==
Scholars have commented that, as both attestations mentioning the beings and location appear to refer to dwarfs, &quot;svartálfr&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot; may simply be synonyms for the same concept. Scholar John Lindow comments that whether the dökkálfar and the svartálfar were considered the same at the time of the writing of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; is also unclear.

<text>The Old Grammar School, St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Derby, England, is now a Ladies Hairdressing Salon.

The building&#x27;s new owner is the daughter of the architect responsible for the original restoration of this historical property. All of the original features of the building have been retained and further extensive restoration work has been carried out at the new owner&#x27;s expense.

The Reverend John Cotton, a principal New England Puritan figure and a founder of Boston, Massachusetts, was educated at Derby School.

The Heritage Centre was established in 1992 by Richard Felix, long time historian on popular Living show Most Haunted and is the starting point for Derby Ghost Walks. The paranormal TV series Most Haunted completed an investigation at the Heritage Centre in 2003.

<doc id="531619" wikidata="Q1604644" url="?curid=531619" title="3D Movie Maker">
<text>3D Movie Maker (commonly shortened to 3DMM) is a children&#x27;s computer program developed by Microsoft Home&#x27;s Microsoft Kids subsidiary released in 1995. Using the program, users can make films by placing 3D characters and props into pre-rendered environments, as well as adding actions, sound effects, music, text, speech and special effects. Movies are then saved in the .3mm file format.

The program features two helper characters to guide users through the various features of the program: The character McZee (voiced by Michael Shapiro), shared from other Microsoft Kids products like Creative Writer, provides help throughout the studio while his assistant Melanie provides other various tutorials. In Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker, the user is instead guided by Stick Stickly.

Developed in accordance with Microsoft&#x27;s broader ambitions towards multimedia software in conjunction with the release of its then-new Windows 95 home computer operating system, 3D Movie Maker is built on BRender, a software rasterized 3D graphics engine created by Argonaut Software. The models and backgrounds were made by Illumin8 Digital Pictures (a now-defunct graphics studio) using Softimage modeling software, while the cinematic introduction and help sequences were made by Productions Jarnigoine, a now-inactive production company founded by Jean-Jacques Tremblay. In 1998, a user named &quot;Space Goat&quot; created the website 3dmm.com that allows users to upload movies and mods for 3DMM. 3dmm.com is still used today by many 3DMM enthusiasts.

Following the open-sourcing of the licensed BRender engine prior in similar fashion, Microsoft released the source code of the program under the MIT License in May 2022, following a request by Foone Turing on Twitter a month earlier.

== Overview ==
Filmmaking in 3D Movie Maker is a straightforward process, allowing users to create various kinds of movies with ease. By default, 40 actors/actresses are available (each with 4 different costumes and a number of actions), as well as 20 different props. Twelve different scenes are available to the user, each containing several different static camera angles. While the actors and props are rendered as polygonal meshes with affine texture mapping and basic shading, the scene backgrounds instead are pre-rendered images with an associated depth buffer that is compared against the runtime-rendered meshes so that aspects of the scene at hand can appear to occlude the meshes once a character or prop is placed behind a static object from the background. Many sample voice and MIDI music clips are included, but original voices can be recorded using a microphone while external .wav and .MIDI files can be imported.

In 3DMM, movies are recorded from frames in quick succession, featuring a destructive editing paradigm. Whilst pre-created animations (such as walking or dancing) can be applied to actors and made to run over a number of frames in sequence, unlike conventional animation software, the interface explicitly does not expose any distinction between abstract keyframes and inbetweens. 3DMM stores the positions of the characters and objects for each frame. Lending itself to the hardware limitations of the time when computers with performant 3D graphics rendering were more out-of-reach for most families, the game&#x27;s internal movie playback frame rate was capped to 6-8 frames per second, depending on the system.

A finished movie can only be viewed inside 3DMM using the virtual auditorium or the studio, unless converted to a video file format with a third-party utility. The application&#x27;s user interface is centered upon a theater building consisting of several rooms: the ticket booth, where the user is greeted by McZee and then asked to play or create a movie; the lobby and concession stand; the theater for watching movies, a projecting room for tutorials for 3D logos and tips, an idea room for movie ideas (also where the talent book stands); and the studio for movie-making tools. The V3DMM version of 3DMM removes the surrounding diegetic theater interface and thus restricts viewing movies only in the studio.

The two common file formats used by 3D Movies are .3mm and .vmm. .nmm was a third file format once used by 3D Movies, but since the release of the &quot;Nickelodeon 3DMM&quot; add-on to 3D Movie Maker, which combined both editions in one program, this has been deprecated by the &quot;.3mm&quot; file format.

The Comic Sans font, originally intended to be used for Microsoft Bob, made its first appearance in 3D Movie Maker. Michael Shapiro, the voice actor for McZee, later went on to voice G-Man in the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series.

==Versions==
* A Japanese expansion pack for 3DMM was released with characters from the popular children&#x27;s manga and anime series &quot;Doraemon&quot;. It consists of 11 new scenes, 5 new characters and 96 new voice lines.
* Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker is a Nickelodeon-themed version of 3D Movie Maker. This version includes 12 unique actors and 11 unique scenes from &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;. An unofficial expansion pack allows Nickelodeon actors, props, scenes, music and sounds to be used in the original &quot;3D Movie Maker&quot;. 
* Demo versions: These only feature the studio, do not allow the opening/saving of movies and only feature two actors and one prop. They are Bongo, Nakita and a red car for 3D Movie Maker, while for Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker they are Ren, Stimpy and a spaceship. A demo version was distributed with the Microsoft Interactive CD Sampler (1996).

==Third-party==
Several user-made expansion packs and animation tools exist, such as:
* 3DMM Animation Pro (2002): Binds mouse movements to the keyboard, which allows directors to create more fluid movements on the screen.
* Doraemon Expansion Pack: This pack was only released in Japan.
* 3DMM Expansion Pack (2003): A user-made expansion pack known as &quot;Frankie&#x27;s Expansion&quot; after its creator Frank Weindel, who introduced the first new textures, actors and objects to the software since release.
* Virtual 3D Movie Maker (V3DMM; 2004): An unofficial third-party expansion management program that allows users to include their own customized expansions in their movies and allow them to be freely distributed. Notable expansions include characters from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;, and other notable media icons.
* 7gen (2005): A GUI for creating V3DMM expansions.
* 3DMM Pencil++ 2: A program for editing 3D Movie Maker datafiles that allows users to edit expansions.
* Nickelodeon Expansion Pack: An unofficial expansion pack that adds all the actors, props, textures, scenes and sounds from Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker.

==Reception==
&quot;Alamo PC Organization&quot; wrote: &quot;This is not a program one masters in a few days, or even weeks. It is a wonderful demonstration of technological advancement for Windows 95 graphical programming possibilities. This program in the hands of casual, perhaps even dedicated home users, is not a threat to any commercial animation firm.&quot; Aaron Matterson of &quot;Joystick Division&quot; said that &quot;it looked impossibly goofy even by 1995 standards, but [I did] love it, and it taught me many things about my own creativity, the art of storytelling, and a strange, terrible humanoid creature named McZee&quot;.

&quot;CNET&quot; said &quot;Still, it&#x27;s encouraging to see what kids can do--and want to spend time doing--with 3D Movie Maker. It ain&#x27;t a master class from Scorsese, but it&#x27;s better than a repeat viewing of Ace Ventura&quot;

<text>Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman and citizen of South Sudan, was a slave for ten years and later became an abolitionist and author living in the United States.

==Biography==
On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlell in southern Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt.

Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman and members of the Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.

Bok has testified before the United States Senate and met with George W. Bush, Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice, telling them his story of slavery. He has been honored by the United States Olympic Committee, the Boston Celtics and colleges and universities throughout the United States and Canada. Francis now lives in the U.S. state of Kansas, where he works for the American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) and Sudan Sunrise, an organization that works for peace in Sudan. Bok&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America&quot;, published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press, chronicles his life, from his early youth, his years in captivity, to his work in the United States as an abolitionist.

== Childhood and abduction ==
Francis Bok was raised in a large Catholic family of cattle herders in the Dinka village of Gurion in Southern Sudan. His father, Bol Buk Dol, managed several herds of cattle, sheep and goats. When Bok was captured at the age of 7 on May 15, 1986, he could not count beyond 10 and knew very little of the outside world.

Bok was captured after his mother, Adut Al Akok, had sent him to the village of Nyamlell to sell eggs and peanuts in the village market with some older siblings and neighbors. This was Bok&#x27;s first trip to the village without his mother, and it was the first time he was allowed to sell some of the family&#x27;s goods at the market.

Bok went to the market, where he heard adults say that they had seen smoke coming from nearby villages and had heard gunfire in the distance. People began fleeing the market as Francis saw horsemen with machine guns. The gunmen surrounded the market and shot the men in Nyamlell. The raiders were part of an Islamic militia from the northern part of Sudan that conducted periodic raids on the villages of their Dinka neighbors, who were Christians or animists of Sub-Saharan African descent.

== Life as a slave ==
Seven-year-old Bok was captured by Giemma, a member of the slave hunting militia, who forced him to join a caravan of slaves, stolen produce, livestock and wares that the militia had captured in their raid of the Dinka settlement. When the members of the militia split up to return to their homes, Bok was taken by Giemma. Upon arriving at Giemma&#x27;s residence, Bok was beaten by his captor&#x27;s children with sticks and was called &quot;abeed&quot;. The word literally means &#x27;slave&#x27; and the stereotype is that of an inferior, demeaned, Negroid race. Bok was given quarters in a hovel near the pens of Giemma&#x27;s livestock.

Bok began a ten-year period of slavery at the hands of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family&#x27;s herds of livestock. He had to take them to pastures in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was not going to be able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.

According to Bok, as he grew older, Giemma and Hamid began to place more trust in his abilities as a herdsman. Care of the cattle, horses and camels was passed to Bok and he was able to spend more time alone with the animals. Previously he had been under the careful supervision of Hamid and sometimes Giemma. In addition to having him serve as his slave, Giemma forced Bok to convert to Islam and to take the Arabic name of Abdul Rahman, meaning &#x27;servant of the compassionate one&#x27;. In his autobiography, Bok states that although he was forced to convert to Islam, he never stopped praying to God for strength to get him through his ordeal.

Bok tried twice to flee from slavery at the age of 14. The first instance happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma&#x27;s fellow militia members. Giemma&#x27;s peer returned Bok to the Giemma&#x27;s compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Bok back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Bok was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as he had become too valuable to the family as a slave.

== Escape ==
Bok waited three years, until 1996, before he tried to escape again. During the intervening three years he tended to the herds and regained Giemma&#x27;s trust. Giemma regularly praised Bok&#x27;s work with the animals yet still forced him to live a life of slavery.

Bok finally escaped from Giemma when he was 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police department to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind as he walked into the crowded marketplace.

Bok asked a man with a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to transport Bok to the town of Ed-Da&#x27;Ein in the back of his truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money and no place to go. A stranger eventually helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.

== Journey to the United States ==
Jabarona was filled with Dinka refugees who had fled the fighting in the south of Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave. Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Bok was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he was a slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.

Upon arriving in Cairo in April 1999, Bok was directed to Sacred Heart Catholic Church. This church was well known among the Dinka in Khartoum as a place of refuge in Cairo. While staying at Sacred Heart, Bok began to learn some English and made important contacts among the Dinka population of Cairo. He also began practicing his Christian faith without fear of reprisal. He eventually moved out of the church compound and into an apartment with other Dinka who were also seeking UN refugee status in order to leave Africa for the United States, Great Britain or Australia.

Bok applied for and received UN refugee status on September 15, 1999, and after several months of waiting, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Bok to move to the U.S. He flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13, 1999, and from there he flew to Fargo, North Dakota. His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church; both worked together to provide him an apartment in Fargo and helped him find a job. Bok worked several jobs, making pallets and plastic knobs for the gearshift of cars. He heard of a large population of Dinka in Ames, Iowa, and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo. It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) based in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Work as an abolitionist ==
Jesse Sage, associate director of the American Anti-Slavery Group, and Jacobs persuaded Bok to move to Boston to work with the AASG. He was initially hesitant to leave his new friends in Ames, but according to Bok, the people at AASG were persistent. He arrived in Boston on May 14, 2000, AASG helped him find an apartment. A week after moving to Boston, he was invited to speak at a Baptist church in Roxbury and was interviewed by Charles A. Radin of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. Two days after his speech in Roxbury, Bok was asked to meet with supporters of AASG on the steps of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. He returned to Washington on September 28, 2000, and became the first escaped slave to speak before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Bok was invited to Washington again in 2002 for the signing of the Sudan Peace Act and met with President George W. Bush. It was during this trip to the White House that Bok became the first former slave to meet with a U.S. President since the 19th century.

Bok has spoken at churches and universities throughout the United States and Canada and he has helped launch the American Anti-Slavery Group&#x27;s website iAbolish.org at a Jane&#x27;s Addiction concert before an audience of 40,000 on April 28, 2001. Perry Farrell was a key early supporter of the iAbolish movement. Bok has also been honored by the Boston Celtics and was chosen to carry the Olympic Torch past Plymouth Rock prior to the 2002 Winter Olympics. His autobiography, &quot;Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America&quot;, was published in 2003 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

Bok currently lives with his wife, Atak, and their two young children, Buk and Dhai, in Kansas. He is now working in the AASG&#x27;s first extension office in Kansas. He also works with Sudan Sunrise, a Lenexa, Kansas-based organization that seeks to work for peace and unity in Sudan.

<text>Bohemond VI (–1275), also known as the Fair, was the prince of Antioch and count of Tripoli from 1251 until his death. He ruled while Antioch was caught between the warring Mongol Empire and Mamluk Sultanate. He allied with the Mongols against the Muslim Mamluks and his Crusaders fought alongside the Mongols in their battles against the Mamluks. The Mamluks would achieve a historic victory against the Mongols and halt their advance westwards at the Battle of Ain Jalut. In 1268 Antioch was captured by the Mamluks under Baybars, and he was thenceforth a prince in exile. He was succeeded by his son, Bohemond VII.

==Life==

Bohemond VI was the son of Bohemond V of Antioch and Lucienne of Segni, great-niece of Pope Innocent III. When Bohemond V died in January 1252, 15-year-old Bohemond VI succeeded under the regency of his mother. However, Lucienne never left Tripoli, and instead handed over the government of the principality to her relatives. This made her unpopular, so the young Bohemond VI, through the approval of King Louis IX of France, who was on Crusade at the time, gained permission from Pope Innocent IV to inherit the principality a few months early. Young Bohemond then travelled to Acre where he was knighted by King Louis, and took power in Antioch. Through the efforts of King Louis, a truce was also negotiated between Antioch and Cilician Armenia. At Louis&#x27;s suggestion, in 1254 the 17-year-old Bohemond married Sibylla, daughter of King Hetoum I of Armenia, which ended the power struggle between the two states that had been started by Bohemond IV, his grandfather.

===War of Saint Sabas===

Bohemond was also overlord of the Genoese Embriaco family. This involved him in a dispute between the Genoese and the Venetians, the War of St. Sabas, which started in 1256 and drew in many of the nobles in the Holy Land, wasted valuable resources and cost tens of thousands of lives. The Embriaco lords of Gibelet (modern Byblos) were resolute opponents of the princes of Antioch. Bohemond tried to persuade the Genoese to support the Venetians, but the Embriaco family rebelled against him in 1258 and escalated the situation to a civil war which lasted off and on for decades. Bohemond was able to achieve some measure of peace by having the leader of the revolt, Bertrand Embriaco (a cousin of Guy I Embriaco), murdered by some serfs, but the bitterness continued.

Bertrand&#x27;s son Bartholomew Embriaco became mayor of a Commune set up by the Embriaco family. Bartholomew&#x27;s brother William, along with his cousin the lord of Gibelet, were eventually defeated by Bohemond&#x27;s son, Bohemond VII, and then completely driven out by the Muslims.

===Mongols===

Bohemond&#x27;s reign also saw a major conflict between the Mamluks and the Mongols. The Mongol army had been approaching steadily from central Asia, with Cilician Armenia and Antioch directly in its path. The Mongols had a deserved reputation of ruthlessness – if settlements in their path did not surrender immediately, the inhabitants were slaughtered by the tens of thousands. The Christian country of Georgia had been conquered in 1236. Hetoum I of Armenia, Bohemond&#x27;s father-in-law, prudently decided to subject to Mongol authority as well, sending his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum in 1247 to negotiate the details. Hethoum later persuaded son-in-law Bohemond VI to do the same, and Antioch became a tributary of the Mongols in 1260. Both Hetoum and Bohemond then participated with their own forces during the 1260 Mongol conquests of Aleppo and Damascus. Historical accounts, quoting from the writings of the medieval historian Templar of Tyre, would often dramatically describe the three Christian rulers (Hetoum, Bohemond, and Kitbuqa) entering the city of Damascus together in triumph, though modern historians have questioned this story as apocryphal.

The Mongols rewarded Bohemond for his allegiance, and returned to him various areas that had been lost to the Muslims, such as Lattakieh, Darkush, Kafr Debbin, and Jabala. Bohemond was then able to re-occupy them, with the assistance of some Templars and Hospitallers.

In return for the lands, Bohemond had to install the Greek patriarch Euthymius at Antioch, in place of the Latin patriarch, since the Mongols were trying to strengthen ties with the Byzantine Empire. This earned Bohemond the enmity of the Latins at Acre, and Bohemond was excommunicated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Jacques Pantaléon. Pope Alexander IV put Bohemond&#x27;s case on the agenda of his upcoming council (as well as the cases of Hetoum I of Armenia, and Daniel of Russia), but died in 1261, just months before the council could be convened. For a new Pope, the choice fell to Pantaléon, who took the name Pope Urban IV, and after hearing Bohemond&#x27;s explanation for his submission to the Mongols, suspended his excommunication sentence.

After taking Damascus, the Mongol Army had to cease their westward push, due to internal troubles in the Mongol Empire. The bulk of the Mongol army left Syria, with a smaller force left under Kitbuqa to occupy the territory. This provided an opportunity for the Egyptian Mamluks. The Mamluks advanced northward from Cairo to engage the Mongols, along the way negotiating an unusual pact of neutrality with the Franks of Acre that allowed the Egyptians to pass through Frankish territory unmolested. The Mamluks were thereby able to defeat the Mongols at the historic Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260. With the Mongol army removed, the Mamluks then proceeded to conquer Syria and Iran, which had been previously ravaged by the Mongols. The Mamluks, under their leader Baibars, also began to threaten Antioch.

In 1263, Bohemond and Hethoum tried various methods of regaining control of the situation. They kidnapped the Greek patriarch Euthymius, and carried him off to Armenia, replacing him with the Latin patriarch Opizzo. They also attempted to gain some financial leverage over the Mamluks. For example, Bohemond and Hethoum controlled the forests of southern Anatolia and Lebanon, the wood of which was needed by the Egyptian Mamluks to build ships. Hethoum attempted to use this as a bargaining chip to obtain a truce with the Mamluks. However, the attempts at blockade merely further incited Baibars.

In 1264, Bohemond also sought assistance from the Mongols. He traveled to the court of Hulagu, trying to obtain as much support as possible from the Mongol rulers against the Mamluk progression. However, Hulagu was unhappy with Bohemond for replacing the Greek patriarch with a Latin one, as the Byzantine alliance was important to him, against the Turks in Anatolia.
===Loss of Antioch===

In 1266, Hetoum too set out for the Mongol court, pleading for assistance. But while he was gone, the Mamluk army attacked the Armenian army, which was being commanded by Hetoum&#x27;s sons, at the Battle of Mari. The Mamluks were victorious. They killed one of Hetoum&#x27;s sons, took the other prisoner, and laid waste to Cilician Armenia, reducing the capital to ruins. After destroying Cilicia, the Mamluk army then turned its attention towards Antioch. But the generals had taken their fill of loot from Armenia, and were not eager for another battle. Bohemond was thereby able to bribe them to keep them from attacking.

Baibars was angry at his generals&#x27; weakness, and returned to the attack. In May 1267 he attacked Acre, and in 1268 he began the Siege of Antioch, taking the city while Bohemond was away in Tripoli. All of northern Syria was quickly lost, leaving Bohemond with no estates except Tripoli.

===Siege of Tripoli===
Baibars attacked again in 1271 by starting the Siege of Tripoli, sending a letter to Bohemond threatening him with total annihilation and taunting him for his alliance with the Mongols:
Bohemond begged for a truce, so as not to lose Tripoli as well. Baibars mocked him for lack of courage and asked him to pay all the expenses of the Mamluk campaign. Bohemond had enough pride left to refuse the offer, but in May Baibars offered him a truce anyway. By this time, the Mamluks had captured every inland castle of the Franks, but the Mamluks had heard reports about a new Crusade, this one from the prince who would later be Edward I of England. Edward had landed in Acre on May 9, 1271, where he was soon joined by Bohemond and his cousin King Hugh III of Cyprus.

Bohemond died in 1275, leaving a son and three daughters: Bohemond VII, nominal prince of Antioch (though Antioch had ceased to exist) and count of Tripoli; Isabelle, who died young; Lucia, later titular countess of Tripoli; and Marie (d. ca 1280), married to Nicolas de Saint-Omer (d. 1294).

The rancour of the Mamluks regarding Bohemond VI&#x27;s alliance with the Mongols would remain until 1289 with the final Fall of Tripoli.

Mawi was born in northern Ethiopia, in the province of Tigray. For about two years of his childhood, he was separated from his father, when he and his siblings and mother had to flee to Sudan to avoid the war in Ethiopia. Mawi was seven years old when he and his family arrived in the U.S. in 1983, sponsored by World Relief. They had spent the previous three years in a refugee camp in Sudan. He grew up in the Chicago suburb of Wheaton, Illinois. He played on his high school basketball team and ran track, the best in his league. He graduated with top honors from Harvard University, receiving a degree in American history and giving the commencement address at his graduation in 1999. He is the author of &quot;Of Beetles and Angels: A Boy&#x27;s Remarkable Journey from a Refugee Camp to Harvard&quot; and &quot;The Code: The 5 Secrets of Teen Success.&quot;

Mawi&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Of Beetles and Angels&quot; was selected by Springfield, Pennsylvania as their community book, and 2,378 people read it there. Day-time television host Oprah Winfrey named her interview of Mr. Asgedom as one of her 20 Unforgettable Moments in October 2005.

&quot;Of Beetles and Angels&quot; was also chosen as the first-ever Evanston, Illinois, citywide reading program with events planned throughout the 2007–2008 school year.

<text>Natuna Regency is an islands regency located in the northernmost part of the Province of Riau Islands, Indonesia. It contains at least 154 islands, of which 127 of them are reported as uninhabited. This archipelago, with a land area of 1,978.49 km2 out of a total area of 264,198.37 km2 area, This area is divided into island clusters such as the Natuna Island Cluster and the Serasan Island Cluster. However, several other islands that are not located in the two clusters are spread over a wider area. This division reflects the geographical and administrative location of the district, but there are also other small islands that are outside these two main clusters and are not always included in the grouping. Administratively, this area is divided into 17 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) which function to facilitate management and services for the local community and support the development of the potential of the region which is rich in natural resources and tourism. This regency also plays an important role in maintaining Indonesia&#x27;s sovereignty in the northern border area.

With 69,003 inhabitants at the 2010 Census and 81,495 at the 2020 Census, most of the population are Malays with 11% of Javanese migrants, Chinese, Minang, Batak, Banjar people, Dayak people, Buginese people, Sundanese people, and tiny percentage of migrants who come from Sulawesi, Bali, and other provinces across Indonesia. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 83,668.

Some 80% of its inhabitants are of Malay origin, numerous being descended from Terengganuan, Johorean, and Pattanian descent as results of contact established since 1597. The consequence of this is the usage of Terengganuan Malay beside the Indonesian language as the official language and the Malay language as a lingua franca across the Province of Riau Islands.

Indonesia&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the coast of Natuna is slightly overlapped by China&#x27;s widely disputed South China Sea claim.

== History ==
===I-Tsing’s Notes===
The discovery of the Natuna Islands by I-Tsing (or Yijing) has been disputed by some historians, who point to errors in interpreting his historical records. Although I-Tsing, a Buddhist monk from the Tang Dynasty, recorded his extensive travels through Southeast Asia and India, there is no strong evidence in his records that explicitly mentions the Natuna Islands. Many historians argue that I-Tsing only referred to the &quot;South Sea&quot; region in general, specifically Srivijaya (now Sumatra), as a center of Buddhist learning.

Most claims that I-Tsing discovered or mentioned Natuna come from misinterpretations of maps and documents related to the voyages of Chinese sailors such as Zheng He who came several centuries later. In his notes, I-Tsing emphasized his journey to India and his life in Srivijaya rather than exploring the sailing routes to specific islands.

Therefore, some critics suggest that the interpretation linking I-Tsing with the discovery of the Natuna Islands may be a historical misunderstanding. They point out that the shipping routes and records linking Natuna are more related to Persian ships and other sailors who had passed through the region long before I-Tsing.

===Became a Malay Sultanate Area===
The most notable history of Natuna Islands followed upon the decision of Alauddin Riayat Shah III of Johor and Green Queen of Pattani Kingdom to claim Natuna Islands as part of their condominium. However, before the Sultan of Johor and the Pattani Monarch declared Natuna Islands as their condominium in 1597, its previous King, Alauddin Riayat II, created Datuk Kayas&#x27;/Dukes&#x27; titles as follows:
# Datok Amar Lela for ruler of Jemaja Island
# Datok Kaya Dewa Perkasa for ruler of Siantan Island
# Datuk Kaya Indra Pahlawan for ruler of Serindit Island, 
# Datuk Kaya Timbalan Siamah for ruler of Tambelan Islands.

;Natuna Under the Influence of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate
The Natuna Islands, located in the South China Sea, had close ties with the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, especially after the collapse of the Johor Sultanate in the early 17th century. The Riau-Lingga Sultanate, established in 1718 after the Johor Sultanate collapsed due to Portuguese attacks and internal conflicts, controlled a vast territory, including the islands around the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea, including the Natuna Islands.

The Riau-Lingga Sultanate played an important role in managing the waters and trade routes in the region. The Natuna Islands were one of the areas controlled by the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, which was centered on Lingga and later in Riau. The influence of this kingdom was clearly visible in the political and economic management of the region, including in regulating shipping routes between the Malay Peninsula and the coastal areas of Sumatra and Borneo. During the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, the official administrative name for the Natuna Islands was Natuna Region or &quot;Pulau Natuna&quot; (in Malay it is called &quot;Pulau Natuna&quot; or &quot;Daerah Natuna&quot; ). During the heyday of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, the influence of Malay culture was very pronounced in the Natuna Islands. The Natuna people, who were mostly of Malay ethnicity, had close ties with this kingdom in the social, cultural, and economic fields. In terms of economy, Natuna became a strategic place for the trade of spices, fish, and other seafood. In addition, the Riau-Lingga Sultanate also protected its territories from external threats, such as colonization by European powers, especially the Netherlands.

After the end of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate and the Dutch colonial influence in the region, the Natuna Islands remained an important part of Indonesia&#x27;s maritime history. To this day, the historical and cultural heritage of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate is still very much felt in Natuna.

Throughout most of its history since the reigns of Sultanate of Riau-Lingga, the Natuna Islands were part of the Archipelago of Seven Islands/&quot;Pulau-pulau Tudjuh/Tujuh&quot; which were consisted of the Anambas Islands (currently a separated regency in the province), the Badas Islands (part of Island District of Tambelan in Bintan Regency), Great Natuna/Bunguran Islands, Sejang, Serasan Islands, Subi Islands, and Tambelan Archipelago (part of Bintan Regency). Although government of Kawedanan of Tudjuh Archipelago was dissolved in 1964, its island districts/&quot;kecamatan&quot; who formed Tudjuh Archipelago still existed until its dissolution in 1999, the sunrise of devolution era government in Indonesia.

===Annexation Period by the Dutch East Indies===
In the early 19th century, the Dutch further expanded their colonial power in the Indonesian archipelago, including the Natuna Islands. In The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the two colonial powers divided their territories in Southeast Asia, with the Netherlands controlling the Indonesian archipelago and England controlling the Malay Peninsula. With this agreement, the Netherlands felt they had rights over areas in the Riau Islands, including Natuna.

However, due to its remote location and inaccessibility, the Dutch initially did not supervise the Natuna Islands directly. It was not until the mid-19th century that the Dutch East Indies began to explore the Natuna Islands further and officially annexed the islands into their colonial territory. The aim was to strengthen control in strategic waters and secure trade routes. The Dutch colonial government then designated Natuna as part of the Riau Residency under the supervision of the Riau Resident based in Tanjung Pinang.

During the Dutch colonial period, life in the Natuna Islands remained largely agrarian and simple. The Dutch did little infrastructure development in the area, although they often patrolled the border to maintain security.

===Japanese Occupation Period (1942-1945)===
When Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies during World War II in 1942-1945, the Natuna Islands were also under the control of the Japanese Empire. Japan saw Natuna as a strategic location for their military defense because of its location in the South China Sea. Therefore, Japan built several military bases on these islands as part of their defense plan in the Southeast Asia region.

The Japanese occupation brought many difficulties to the people of Natuna, because in addition to the heavy Japanese military presence, food was also difficult to obtain. After Japan surrendered in 1945, Indonesia proclaimed independence, but Natuna still had to face a complicated transition period as colonial rule ended.

===Becoming Part of Indonesia===
After the proclamation of Indonesian independence on August 17, 1945, the Natuna Islands became part of the newly independent Republic of Indonesia. Initially, Natuna was part of the Central Sumatra Province. However, due to its strategic position and location on the border of the South China Sea, the Indonesian government then decided to move the Natuna administration to Riau Province in 1957.

As Indonesia&#x27;s territory expanded, in 2002 the Natuna Islands became part of the Riau Islands Province, after the province was formed as a separate province from Riau Province. The formation of the Riau Islands Province provided greater autonomy for border areas such as Natuna, as well as greater attention to infrastructure, economic and defense development.

==Geography==
The Natuna Islands are a 272-island archipelago of Indonesia, located in the Natuna Sea between Peninsular Malaysia to the west and Borneo to the east. They extend in a NNW direction for 300 km from Tanjung Api, the northwest extremity of Kalimantan/Borneo. The Natuna Sea itself is a section of the South China Sea.

The North Group consists of a large island (Pulau Laut), two small islands and several adjacent islets and reefs which lie about 50 km NNW of Natuna Besar Island. Pulau Laut is about 11 km long with a greatest width of 5 km towards the south; it is generally hilly, rising to 273 metres near its north end.

The Middle Group consists of Natuna Besar or Bunguran Island, which contains the bulk of the area and population of the archipelago, together with small offshore islets and reefs; the Bodas Islands (&quot;Kepulauan Bodas&quot;) are a group of moderately high wooded islands lying close to the southwest coast of Natuna Besar, and are administratively classed as the districts of Pulau Tiga and Pulau Tiga Barat.

The Southern Group (&quot;Kepulauan Natuna Selatan&quot;) consists primarily of two groups of islands separated from the coast of Kalimantan by the Api Passage. The Subi Islands (&quot;Kepulauan Subi&quot;) of which the main islands are Subi Besar, Subi Kecil, Bakau, Panjang and Seraya, lie southeast of Natuna Besar. Serasan Island (&quot;Pulau Serasan&quot;) is the largest of the group of islands lying further to the southeast and nearer to Kalimantan, from which it is separated by the Serasan Strait. A third group - centred on Midai Island - lies to the west of the Subi Islands.

The highest point of the Bunguran Islands is Mount Ranai at . The islands had a population of 52,000 inhabitants according to the 2010 census; the estimated population in mid 2023 was about 64,250. The principal settlement is Ranai. The island can be reached by scheduled air services via Ranai Airport.

===Natural resources===
Natuna has large reserves of natural gas (estimated at 1.3 billion m3) that is exported to neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. Matak Island located in Anambas now functions as an offshore exploitation base.

===Ecology===
The Natuna Islands are part of the Borneo lowland rain forests ecoregion.

The Natuna Islands have a remarkable avifauna with 71 species of bird registered, including the near-threatened lesser fish eagle, the Natuna serpent-eagle. Other endangered species include the green iora, the brown fulvetta or the green broadbill.

The Natuna Islands is home to three species of non-human primates: the slow loris (&quot;Nycticebus coucang&quot;), the long-tailed macaque (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;), and the Natuna leaf monkey (a.k.a. Natuna pale-thighed surili, &quot;Presbytis natunae&quot;). A small number of wild goats live on the island as well as sea birds. Over 360 species of bird have been recorded on the island.

Colourful coral reefs are found in the neighbouring waters. The Natuna banded leaf monkey, &quot;Presbytis natunae&quot;, is among the 25 most endangered primates on Earth.

== Government and politics ==
=== Administrative districts ===
As of 2010, the Regency was divided into twelve districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), but on 10 December 2014 three additional districts were created by dividing existing districts, and two further districts have subsequently been created by similar division. The seventeen districts are tabulated below from north to south with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the location of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages (70 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 7 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) within each district and its postcodes.

Notes: (a) the populations of the new Pulau Seluan District are included in the figures for Bunguran Utara District, from which it was split off in 2022. &lt;br&gt;(b) comprising 4 &quot;kelurahan&quot; (Bandarsyah, Batu Hitam, Ranai Darat and Ranai Kota) and 3 &quot;desa&quot;. (c) the 2010 population of the new Bunguran Batubi District is included in the figure for Bunguran Barat District, from which it was split off in 2014. &lt;br&gt;(d) the 2010 population of the new Pulau Tiga Barat District is included in the figure for Pulau Tiga District, from which it was split off in 2014. &lt;br&gt;(e) the 2010 population of the new Suak Midai District is included in the figure for Midai District, from which it was split off in 2014. &lt;br&gt;(f) the populations of the new Pulau Panjang District are included in the figures for Subi District, from which it was split off in 2022.

===Maritime administration and Chinese claim===
Indonesia&#x27;s EEZ extends 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its shores (as per the 1982 UNCLOS), which, around Natuna, means it is slightly intersected by China&#x27;s nine-dash line, defining its widely disputed claim to most of the South China Sea. In 2014–2015, the presence of the Indonesian National Armed Forces on the islands was reinforced, which the Indonesian government hoped would reduce the chance of any conflict. Then from late 2019, Chinese fishing vessels increased illegal activity within the EEZ, escorted by a Chinese Coast Guard vessel. Indonesia responded with a formal diplomatic protest to Beijing and then deployed to the region a further 600 troops and eight navy warships, along with aerial support. The naval presence included Ahmad Yani-class frigates, Bung Tomo-class corvettes, and Kapitan Pattimura-class ASW corvettes, while aerial support came from Naval aviation CN-235 MPA aircraft, four Indonesian Air Force F-16s and a Boeing 737-2x9, with BAE Hawk aircraft nearby on alert. A visit to the area by President Joko Widodo in early January 2020 reinforced Indonesia&#x27;s resolve not to tolerate such incursions.

During a November 2024 state visit by Indonesian President Probowo Subianto to China, Indonesia and China signed a memorandum of understanding for &quot;joint maritime development&quot; in the area of the two countries &quot;overlapping claims&quot; near the Natuna Islands. Indonesia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry subsequently issued a statement that the memorandum did not impact Indonesia&#x27;s sovereignty or rights in the area and stating that in Indonesia&#x27;s view the Chinese claims do not have a legal basis. Critics of the memorandum who were quoted by the South China Morning Post contended that the wording could support China&#x27;s position regarding the South China Sea claims.

==Economy==
Natuna Regency has great economic potential, especially in the marine, fisheries, and marine tourism sectors which are rich in natural beauty, such as beaches, coral reefs, and marine biodiversity. This potential can be the main source of regional income and create jobs for the local community. However, economic development in Natuna Regency faces challenges in infrastructure and inter-island connectivity as well as accessibility to other regions, which are still limited and affect the distribution of goods and public services. Therefore, the development of infrastructure such as ports, small airports, and adequate transportation routes is urgently needed to improve connectivity and accelerate regional economic development. In addition, to reduce dependence on natural resources and maintain long-term economic stability, diversification efforts into more sustainable sectors are needed. Increasing human resource capacity through training in the fisheries, tourism, and marine product processing sectors is also an important step to increase regional competitiveness and support the welfare of the Natuna community in a sustainable manner.

==Demographics==
=== Peoples ===
According to the 2010 census returns (released in 2011), the population of the islands stood at 69,003 people. 85.27% of the inhabitants were Malays, with the remainder consisting of Javanese, Sumatrans and Chinese. By the 2020 census, this had grown to 81,495, and by mid 2023 it had grown to 83,668.

===Religion===
Islam is the dominant religion in the islands, with 96.97% of the total population identify themselves as Muslim. Other religions are Christianity, which forms 1.66% of the total population, Buddhism, which forms 1.23% of the total population, and Confucianism, which forms 0.14% of the total population. The largest mosque is located in the north-east corner of the islands. The Masjid Agung Natuna was built over two years from 2007 to 2009, and is visited by at least 10,000 people every day.

==Transportation==
===Harbors and airports===
The military harbour was headquartered on Teuku Umar for Navy ships tasked on the Natuna Sea.

Ranai-Natuna Airport is located at Ranai, the capital city of Natuna Regency. The airport is also a Type B airbase of the Indonesian Air Force. Other than that, the airport also serves civilian flights. The airport also accommodates large military aircraft. A new passenger terminal opened in October 2016, inaugurated by President Joko Widodo.

The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 18/36 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,560 m x 32 m (8,399 ft × 105 ft). The runway is planned to be widened to 80 m in 2020. Moreover, the airport has an apron measuring 120 m x 60 m and a taxiway measuring 50 m x 32 m.

The recently built terminal at the airport has an area of 3,868 m2, many times larger than the old terminal which only had an area of 243 m2. The new terminal can accommodate around 13,850 passengers daily. The parking lot has been expanded to 5,020 m2 and can now cater to around 3,940 cars and 750 motorcycles. Other facilities inside the airport are the Aviation Accidents Rescue and Fire Fighting building, a generator and the pump house.

<doc id="531637" wikidata="Q3112559" url="?curid=531637" title="Government of New York City">
<text>The government of New York City, headquartered at New York City Hall in Lower Manhattan, is organized under the New York City Charter and provides for a mayor-council system. The mayor is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for the administration of city government. The New York City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 members, each elected from a geographic district, normally for four-year terms. Primary elections for local offices use ranked choice voting, while general elections use plurality voting. All elected officials are subject to a two consecutive-term limit. The court system consists of two citywide courts and three statewide courts.

New York City&#x27;s government employs approximately 330,000 people, more than any other city in the United States and more than any U.S. state but three: California, Texas, and New York. The city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services.

New York City consists of five boroughs, each coextensive with one of five counties of New York State: Brooklyn is Kings County, the Bronx is Bronx County, Manhattan is New York County, Queens is Queens County, and Staten Island is Richmond County. When New York City was consolidated into its present form in 1898, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished in favor of the present five boroughs and a unified, centralized city government. However, each county retains its own district attorney to prosecute crimes, and most of the court system is organized around the counties. Because of this, New York City is not considered to be an independent city nor a consolidated city-county, as it technically encompasses multiple counties which each have limited autonomy. Rather, the municipal structure of New York City exists in a category of its own (&quot;sui generis&quot;). Each borough also has an elected Borough President, which is a largely ceremonial office.

New York City is divided between two federal judicial districts. Bronx County and New York County are in the Southern District while Kings County, Queens County, and Richmond County are in the Eastern District, although both districts have concurrent jurisdiction over the waters in their respective districts.
==Executive branch==
The executive branch of New York City consists of the Mayor, and numerous departments, boards and commissions. The Mayor also appoints several deputy mayors to head major offices within the executive branch of the city government. &quot;The City Record&quot; is the official journal published each weekday (except legal holidays) containing legal notices produced by city agencies, and regulations are compiled in the &quot;Rules of the City of New York&quot;.

===Mayor===

The Mayor is the chief executive officer of the city and a magistrate, appoints and removes all unelected officers and exercises all the powers vested in the city except otherwise provided by law, and is responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of city government operations. The mayor is directly elected by popular vote for a four-year term. The mayor is also responsible for creating the city&#x27;s budget through the New York City Mayor&#x27;s Office of Management and Budget, submitted for approval, not drafting, to the Council.

===Mayoral agencies===
==Other citywide offices==
Along with the mayor, the Public Advocate and the Comptroller are the only three directly elected citywide officials in New York City.

===Public Advocate===
The Public Advocate is an elected official with responsibility to ease public relations with the government, investigate complaints regarding city agencies, mediate disputes between city agencies and citizens, serve as the city&#x27;s ombudsman and advise the mayor on community relations. The Public Advocate is a member of the Council. The Public Advocate stands first in line of succession to the mayoralty.

===Comptroller===
The Comptroller conducts performance and financial audits of all city agencies, serves as a fiduciary to the city&#x27;s five public pension funds totaling nearly $160 billion in assets, provides comprehensive oversight of the city&#x27;s budget and fiscal condition, reviews city contracts for integrity, accountability and fiscal compliance, manages the fair, efficient and effective resolution of claims against the city, ensures transparency and accountability in the prevailing wage rate-setting process and enforces prevailing wage and living wage laws. The Comptroller stands second, after the Public Advocate, in the line to succeed a mayor who has become unable to serve.

===Non-mayoral agencies===
There are also numerous commissions, boards, tribunals and offices that are independent of the mayor&#x27;s office.

==Legislative branch==

Legislative power in the City of New York is vested in the New York City Council. The New York State Constitution empowers local governments to adopt local laws in addition to ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations.

The Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 Council members, whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries that each contain approximately 157,000 people. Council members are elected every four years, except that after every census held in years divisible by twenty, districts are redrawn, requiring two consecutive two-year terms, the second of which is held in the redrawn districts. The Speaker of the Council, selected by the 51 Council members, is often considered the second most powerful post in New York City&#x27;s government after the Mayor.

Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor, who may sign them into law. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote. A local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the New York State Legislature (subject to certain exceptions and restrictions), and is superior to the older forms of municipal legislation such as ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations. The codified local laws of New York City are contained in the &quot;New York City Administrative Code&quot;.

The Council has several committees with oversight of various functions of the city government. Each council member sits on at least three standing, select or subcommittees. The standing committees meet at least once per month. The Speaker of the Council, the Majority Leader, and the Minority Leader are all &quot;ex officio&quot; members of every committee.

Prior to 1990, the city also had a powerful Board of Estimate, a unique legislative-executive hybrid. Although it could not pass laws, it shared authority for the city budget with the council and controlled functions such as land use, municipal contracts, franchises, and water and sewer rates. The Board&#x27;s membership consisted of the mayor, comptroller, president of the City Council, and the five borough presidents. The three citywide officials each cast two votes, and the borough presidents one each. In 1989, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Board of Estimate as violating the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, due to the dramatically unequal numbers of constituents being represented by each borough president. The city subsequently adopted its current arrangement by referendum.

==Courts==
The state court system in New York City has two citywide courts, the Criminal Court and the Civil Court, and several statewide courts, the Supreme Court, Surrogate&#x27;s Court, and Family Court. Unlike the rest of New York, New York City counties do not have a typical County Court. Each statewide court is located in each of New York City&#x27;s five counties (boroughs). There are also numerous extrajudicial administrative courts such as OATH, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System.

The Criminal Court of the City of New York handles summons court appearance tickets, violations, misdemeanors (generally, crimes punishable by fine or imprisonment of up to one year), and conducts arraignments (initial court appearances following arrest) and preliminary hearings in felony cases.

The Civil Court of the City of New York includes Housing Court for landlord-tenant matters, Small Claims Court for cases involving amounts up to $5000, and generally has jurisdiction for damages up to $25,000. It handles about 25% of all the New York state and local courts&#x27; total filings. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, e.g. the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) adjudicates matters for city agencies unless otherwise provided for by law, and the city Parking Violations Bureau adjudicates parking violations.

The Supreme Court of the State of New York is the trial court of general jurisdiction, which in New York City hears felony cases and major civil cases. (Lesser criminal and civil cases are heard in the Criminal Court and Civil Court, respectively.) The Family Court of the State of New York is a family court that hears cases involving children and families. The Surrogate&#x27;s Court of the State of New York is the probate court which oversees the probate of wills and administers estates.

==Borough and community government==
New York City is composed of five boroughs or counties, collectively comprising 59 community districts.

===Borough presidents===
Each of the five boroughs has an elected borough president. The borough presidents can have legislation introduced in the council, recommend capital projects, hold public hearings on matters of public interest, make recommendations to the mayor and to other city officials, make recommendations on land use and planning, and make recommendations regarding the performance of contracts providing for the delivery of services, in the interests of the people of their borough.

===Borough boards===
Each of the five boroughs has a borough board. They are composed of the borough president, Council members from the borough, and the chairperson of each community board in the borough. The borough boards can hold or conduct public or private hearings, adopt by-laws, prepare comprehensive and special purpose plans and make recommendations for land use and planning, mediate disputes and conflicts among two or more community boards, submit a comprehensive statement of the expense and capital budget priorities and needs, evaluate the progress of capital developments and the quality and quantity of services provided by agencies, and otherwise consider the needs of the borough.

===Community boards===
Each of the fifty-nine community districts has a community board composed of up to 50 volunteer members appointed by the local borough president, half from nominations by Council members representing the community district (&quot;i.e.&quot;, whose council districts cover part of the community district). Community boards advise on land use and zoning, participate in the city budget process, and address service delivery in their district. Community boards act in an advisory capacity, wielding no official authority to make or enforce laws.

==State and county government==
===District attorneys===
Each of the five counties of New York City elects a district attorney (DA) for a four-year term, whose duty it is to prosecute all crimes and offenses cognizable by the courts of the county. There is also a sixth DA, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Narcotics, who is unelected, but appointed by the five elected DAs.

===Public authorities===
The Brooklyn Public Library and Queens Public Library are public library systems within their respective boroughs. The New York Public Library is a private, non-governmental library serving the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, that receives government funding. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) provides public housing for low- and moderate-income residents. NYC Health + Hospitals (New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, or HHC) operates public hospitals and clinics. The New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) is the city&#x27;s economic development corporation.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) manages the New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations through its arm the New York City Transit Authority. Despite this name, the NYCTA, like the rest of the MTA, was created by the New York State Legislature as a public-benefit corporation, which the legislature and governor of New York control. The MTA also operates the Staten Island Railway within Staten Island, as well as the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, both of which are commuter lines that have termini in the city but run largely in the suburban counties of New York State and Connecticut.

Other regional transportation is managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, including the bridges and tunnels between New York City and New Jersey, and all airports and seaports within the city. The Port Authority is an interstate compact operating agency jointly controlled by the Governor of New Jersey and Governor of New York.

===Political parties===
State Election Law defines the structure of political parties. It requires each party to have a state committee and allows them to organize county committees. The county committees are composed of at least two members elected from each election district (containing a maximum of 950–1150 registered voters). The law also allows the election of assembly district leaders. The political parties&#x27; county executive committees typically select candidates for local offices, to be ratified by the full county committees. Many small parties do not have county committees and designate candidates at the state level. The political parties&#x27; judicial nominating conventions select candidate New York Supreme Court justices. Candidates for the citywide offices of mayor, comptroller and public advocate are designated jointly by the five county executive committees of each party. In most cases, insurgents who are party members can challenge party-designated candidates by petitioning for a primary election.

==Heraldry==
The seal of New York City, adopted in an earlier form in 1686, bears the legend , which means simply &quot;The Seal of the City of New York&quot;. &quot;Eboracum&quot; was the Roman name for York, the titular seat of James II as Duke of York. The two supporters represent the unity between Native Americans and colonists, the four windmill sails recall the city&#x27;s Dutch history as New Amsterdam, and the beavers and flour barrels the city&#x27;s earliest trade goods (see History of New York City). The crest over the seal is the American eagle, added after the American Revolution. &quot;1625&quot;, the date at the bottom, was chosen to emphasize the city&#x27;s Dutch roots but has been characterized as &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;simply wrong&quot; by notable city historians (New Amsterdam was actually settled in 1624).

The flag of New York City was adopted in 1915. Its blue, white, and orange bands represent the colors of the Dutch flag that flew over the city, then New Amsterdam, between the 1620s and 1660s. Located in the center is a blue print of the official Seal of New York City minus its Latin motto.

There are two official variants of the New York City flag. The Mayor&#x27;s Office version adds an arc of five five-pointed stars (representing each of the five boroughs) in blue above the seal, and the Councilmanic version adds the word &quot;COUNCIL&quot; in blue below the seal.

<text>The Bunguran Islands are an archipelago in Riau Islands province, Indonesia, located in the Natuna Sea, the southern portion of the South China Sea. The archipelago forms the central part of the Natuna Regency, an archipelago of 272 islands in total, which is in turn included in the Tudjuh Archipelago, off the northwest coast of Borneo. The largest island of the archipelago is Bunguran or Pulau Natuna Besar (Great Natuna Island), situated in the Middle Natuna Archipelago. The group covers a land area of 1,698.6 km2 and had a population of 52,013 at the 2010 Census. It is divided into nine districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) – seven of which are tabulated below from north to south with their areas and 2010 Census populations, plus the number of administrative villages within that district (after the creation of two additional districts since 2010) and the postcode:

Two additional districts have been created since 2010 out of the existing districts - Bunguran Batubi (split from Bunguran Barat district) and Pulau Tiga Barat (split from Pulau Tiga district).

<doc id="531644" wikidata="Q1262708" url="?curid=531644" title="Mazatec">
<text>The Mazatec are an Indigenous people of Mexico who inhabit the Sierra Mazateca in the state of Oaxaca and some communities in the adjacent states of Puebla and Veracruz.

Some researchers have theorized that the Mazatec, along with Popoloca speakers, once inhabited the lowlands of the Papaloapan basin, but were driven into the adjacent highlands by the expansion of Nahuas.

==Language family==
The Mazatecan languages are part of the Popolocan family which, in turn, is part of the Otomanguean language family.

==Traditional religious rituals==
Mazatec tradition includes the cultivation of entheogens for spiritual and ritualistic use. Plants and fungi used for this purpose include psilocybin mushrooms, psychoactive morning glory seeds (from species such as &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; and &quot;Ipomoea corymbosa&quot;), and &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;. This latter plant is known to Mazatec shamans as &quot;ska María Pastora&quot;, the name containing a reference to the Virgin Mary.

<doc id="531648" wikidata="Q3249210" url="?curid=531648" title="130 departments of the First French Empire">
<text>This is a list of the 130 departments (), the conventional name for the administrative subdivisions of the First French Empire at the height of its territorial extent, circa 1811.

Several territories of European France were also ruled over directly by France but were not organised into departments, these being: Illyrian Provinces, and the Principality of Erfurt, and so these are not included in this list. Similarly, four additional French departments were also created in Catalonia (annexed from Spain in 1812); their juridical status remained incomplete until the French lost their grip on Spain in 1814. Those departments were: Bouches-de-l&#x27;Èbre, Montserrat, Sègre, and Ter.

==List==
The names of departments formed from territories annexed to France after 1791 have been colour-coded as follows:

Moreover, the Tanaro department was established in 1802 and disbanded in 1805; it was one of the six original &quot;départments&quot; which took the place of the Subalpine Republic. Its territory was divided between the three &quot;départments&quot; of Marengo, Stura, and Montenotte (the latter was created after the annexation of the Ligurian Republic).

<doc id="531662" wikidata="Q4742988" url="?curid=531662" title="American Anti-Slavery Group">
<text>The American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) is a non-profit coalition of abolitionist organizations that engages in political activism to abolish slavery in the world. It raises awareness of contemporary slavery, particularly among the chattel slaves of Mauritania and Sudan, raises funds to support relief and aid to enslaved populations and escaped former slaves, and lobbies government officials to increase their efforts. AASG&#x27;

AASG was co-founded in 1993 by Charles Jacobs (who served as its first research director) with African human rights activists Mohamed Athie of Mauritania and David Chand of Sudan.

Incorporated in Newton, Massachusetts, the AASG reports having &quot;many associates and 30,000 members around the world.&quot; Recent officers include: Mohamed Athie (past president) and Charles Jacobs (past clerk and treasurer; current president and member of board of directors).

AASG maintains close ties to The Sudan Campaign, for which Charles Jacobs serves as a co-chairman.

==Central components==
AASG says that the first step in eradicating slavery is educating the public that it still exists. AASG builds awareness through publications, school curricula, conferences, and a Speakers’ Bureau, consisting mainly of survivors of slavery. AASG advocates for the freedom of those degraded by slavery through government lobbying and online campaigns, which locate pressure points in corporations that benefit from slavery, governments that tolerate human bondage, and leaders who remain silent. On their website, AASG state that they have a network of activists around the world who are passionate about freedom. Grassroots activism takes the form of rallies, candlelight vigils, freedom marches, petitions and letter-writing campaigns. AASG partners with organizations working on the ground to provide rehabilitation and support to victims of slavery.&quot;

==Modern-day slavery==
On June 4, 2008, the U.S. released a trafficking in persons report. In this report Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, &quot;Trafficking and exploitation plague all nations, and no country, even ours, is immune.&quot;

==Controversies==
The AASG claims of contemporary slavery have been met with criticism from BBC journalist David Hecht.

Hecht has challenged the AASG claims of rampant slavery in Sudan. &quot;Yes, there is a slave (and master) mentality in Africa, but nothing like the dehumanized institutions that Frederick Douglass had to fight in America.&quot; He also reported that Western media are often naïve misunderstandings of the facts. Claiming that outside those areas controlled by the Sudanese Government, the old practice of intertribal feuding continues. In these raids prisoners are taken, who must then be ransomed. What looks like the purchase of slaves is actually the redemption of prisoners of war.

Anti-Slavery International has also stated that, &quot;The charge that government troops engage in raids for the purpose of seizing slaves is not backed by the evidence.&quot;

===Controversy of redemption program===
The AASG supported program of arrangement of payment to human traffickers for the &quot;freedom&quot; of slaves has come under fire. Aid workers, missionaries, and even the rebel movement that facilitates the redemption of slaves in the claim it is often an elaborate scam or a &quot;corrupt racket.&quot; Groups, including the Sudan Embassy, Canada, state that the practice of paying the rebels prolongs the war, while others claim it brought the &quot;perverse incentives&quot; of slavery in many areas. Manase Lomole Waya, who runs Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudan, a group based in Nairobi, praises AASG for its effort, but brings a warning: &quot;We welcome them for exposing the agony of our people to the world,&quot; he said. &quot;That part is good. But giving the money to the slave traders only encourages the trade. It is wrong and must stop. Where does the money go? It goes to the raiders to buy more guns, raid more villages, put more shillings in their pockets. It is a vicious circle.&quot;

Charles Jacobs, president of the American Anti-Slavery Group, concedes there is an increase in slave-taking since 1995 in terms of the growing intensity of the Sudanese war, but rebukes characterizations that it creates a market for the slave trade. He asserts that although war is the context for the slave trade, it cannot be the main cause. Thus, the transactions to free slaves do not contribute to the cycle of violence in the Sudan.

<text>TPR Storytelling (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling or TPRS) is a method of teaching foreign languages. TPRS lessons use a mixture of reading and storytelling to help students learn a foreign language in a classroom setting. The method works in three steps: in step one the new vocabulary structures to be learned are taught using a combination of translation, gestures, and personalized questions; in step two those structures are used in a spoken class story; and finally, in step three, these same structures are used in a class reading. Throughout these three steps, the teacher will use a number of techniques to help make the target language comprehensible to the students, including careful limiting of vocabulary, constant asking of easy comprehension questions, frequent comprehension checks, and very short grammar explanations known as &quot;pop-up grammar&quot;. Many teachers also assign additional reading activities such as free voluntary reading, and there have been several easy novels written by TPRS teachers for this purpose.

Proponents of TPR Storytelling, basing their argument on the second language acquisition theories of Stephen Krashen, hold that the best way to help students develop both fluency and accuracy in a language is to expose them to large amounts of comprehensible input. The steps and techniques in TPR Storytelling help teachers to provide this input by making the language spoken in class both comprehensible and engaging. In addition, TPR Storytelling uses many concepts from mastery learning. Each lesson is focused on three vocabulary phrases or fewer, enabling teachers to concentrate on teaching each phrase thoroughly. Teachers also make sure that the students internalize each phrase before moving on to new material, giving additional story lessons with the same vocabulary when necessary.

TPR Storytelling is unusual in that it is a grassroots movement among language teachers. After being developed by Blaine Ray in the 1990s, the method has gained popular appeal with language teachers who claim that they can reach more students and get better results than they could with previous methods. It is enjoying increasing attention from publishers and academic institutions. A number of practitioners publish their own materials and teaching manuals, and training in TPR Storytelling is generally offered at workshops by existing TPRS teachers rather than at teacher training college.

== History ==
TPR Storytelling was developed by Blaine Ray, a high school Spanish teacher in California, during the 1990s. Ray had had initial success teaching using total physical response (TPR), but was disappointed when his students stopped finding this technique to be interesting. Ray was familiar with Stephen Krashen&#x27;s theories, and he was confident that his students would acquire Spanish naturally if he gave them enough comprehensible input. He set about finding a way to combine TPR with stories, with input from Krashen and from other foreign language teachers, and the result was Total Physical Response Storytelling.

This new method continued to evolve with the input of teachers, and by 2000 there was a greater emphasis on reading and the spoken class story, with the time spent doing traditional TPR being reduced. To reflect these changes, the TPRS acronym was changed to stand for Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling. TPR Storytelling is now trademarked by Blaine Ray.

Although TPR Storytelling is a growing movement among foreign language teachers, particularly in the United States, it has received little coverage in academia. In the United States the method has gained support from some language teachers, and some school districts use it exclusively in their foreign language programs. It has also been used in language revitalization programs. In Jerusalem, Israel TPR Storytelling has been adapted by The Polis Institute, a school for ancient languages and the humanities. In adapting the strategy of storytelling, the Polis Method excludes translations and explanations in any language other than the one being taught.

== Method ==

TPR Storytelling is broadly divided into three steps, with each being regarded as essential for a successful program.

=== Step one: establish meaning ===
In this step the students are introduced to the new vocabulary phrases for the lesson. There is no set number of new items to be introduced in a given session; however, three is generally considered the maximum number that can be effectively taught in a lesson. Limiting the phrases like this allows the teacher to focus on them and provide many repetitions for the students. This emphasis on thoroughly learning new material is designed to give the students a feeling of confidence and to provide sufficient repetitions to facilitate acquisition (unconscious control in recognition and output) of the new items.

The three phrases (structures) are written on the blackboard, or another place where the students can easily see them, and are translated into the students&#x27; native language if a shared native language is available. If students forget what a phrase means, they can glance at the board and check the meaning at any time.

The teacher may elect to practice the new phrases using gestures, in a style modeled after traditional TPR. This gives the students the chance to get used to how the phrases sound before hearing them in context. It is also intended to keep the atmosphere of the class relaxed and conducive to learning.

Then the teacher asks questions about the students using the target phrases. These questions are known as &quot;Personalized Questions and Answers&quot; (PQA). To ensure these questions are comprehensible to the students, the teacher uses a variety of techniques and comprehension checks. Depending on the responses from the students and the atmosphere of the class, these questions might lead into a scene or skit often referred to as &quot;extended PQA&quot;. The details discovered by the teacher from PQA are often used as the basis for the class story.

The goal of the teacher during step one is to provide as many spoken repetitions of the new structures in context as possible. This lays the foundation for student recognition of the structures during the storytelling time.

=== Step two: spoken class story ===
In step two, students hear the three structures many times in the context of a spoken class story. This story is usually short, simple, and interesting, and will contain multiple instances of the target structures used in context. The number of times the structures are heard is further increased by the &quot;circling&quot; questioning technique. TPRS teachers aim to say each new structure at least 50 times in the course of a story, and it is not unusual to hear those structures 100 times.

The teacher will usually use a skeleton script with very few details, and then flesh the story out using details provided by the students in the target language, making a personalized story for each class. Using the circling technique, teachers can ask for these new details while still keeping the target language comprehensible. Advanced TPRS teachers are able to improvise, creating stories solely based on student answers to questions about the day&#x27;s vocabulary structures. The focus is always on the target structures, allowing the details to support those structures.

The actions in the story may be acted out by volunteers from the class. When the teacher makes a statement that advances the story plot, the actors will act out that statement and then wait while the teacher continues with the circling questions.

The story will often take place in distinct locations. The main character in the story may start off in one location with a problem that they need to solve. They may move to a second location, where they try to solve the problem, but fail. Then they may move to a third location where they resolve the problem. This narrative device is used to maximize the repetitions of the target structures, to make the story easy to understand, and to make the target phrases easy to remember. &quot;Keeping space&quot;, or having students or the teacher physically move to locations in the classroom that represent the various locations in the story, is an aid to students in understanding the action and language they are hearing.

After the story has finished the teacher may retell it in briefer form, retell it with errors having students correct them, or ask the students to retell the story, allowing them to use the structures they just learned. This can be in pairs, in groups, or one student retelling in front of the class.

=== Step three: reading ===
Step three is where the students learn to read the language structures that they have heard in steps one and two. A number of reading activities are used in TPRS. The first, and most common, is a class reading, where the students read and discuss a story that uses the same language structures as the story in step two. The next most common activity is free voluntary reading, where students are free to read any book they choose in the language being learned. The other activities are shared reading and homework reading. For shared reading, as in first-language literacy activities, the teacher brings in a children&#x27;s picture book, and reads it to the students in class, making it comprehensible through circling and other means. Homework reading, as the name implies, means assigning specific reading for students to do at home. All readings in TPRS are comprehensible to the students, which means a very low ratio of unknown words (if any).

==== Class reading ====
The class reading is the most common type of reading activity in TPR Storytelling. TPRS teachers will typically include a class reading as part of every TPRS lesson sequence. This reading is based on the story that the students learned in step two - sometimes it can be the same story, and sometimes it uses the same language structures but with different content. Ideally, the story should be structured so that students will be able to understand most of the story on first view.

The teacher will often begin the class reading by reading aloud the story, or a portion of the story, then having the students translate it into their first language. This translation could be done with individual students, or by the whole class. Translation is utilized selectively in this way as a direct method of ensuring an accurate understanding of the language meaning. This process aims to ensure that all of the students understand all of the words in the reading, as well as the meaning of the reading as a whole.

Next, the class will discuss the reading in the target language. With the goal of making the discussion 100% comprehensible, the teacher will use the same TPRS techniques as in step two. Also, the teacher may make use of the pop-up grammar technique, where grammar points contained in the reading are explained very briefly - in 5 seconds or less. A limited number of grammar points are focused on in any particular reading and they are &quot;popped up&quot; frequently to enhance student retention. The discussion can touch on a wide range of topics related to the reading.

==== Free voluntary reading ====
Many TPRS teachers include Free voluntary reading (FVR) in their foreign language programmes. The research for FVR is very strong, and has consistently shown that FVR is as good or better than taught language lessons. Free voluntary reading can be done in the classroom or at home, but many teachers prefer to focus on spoken stories in class, as it is hard for students to get listening input outside school.

==== Shared reading ====
Shared reading, often called &quot;Kindergarten Day&quot;, refers to the practice of the teacher reading a children&#x27;s picture storybook to the students. The name is intended to conjure up the image of being read to as a child, but the activity can be done with any age group.

==== Homework reading ====
As the name implies, this is a specific reading that is assigned to all students for homework. The teacher can give a quiz on the reading when the students get back to class.

== Techniques ==
Many smaller teaching techniques are key to the success of TPR Storytelling. They range from the simple, such as speaking slowly or paying close attention to the students&#x27; eyes, to the complex, like the &quot;circling&quot; technique of asking questions. These techniques all have the same basic aim of keeping the class comprehensible, interesting, and as efficient as possible for language acquisition.

=== Circling ===
&quot;Circling&quot; is the practice of asking a series of simple questions about a statement, all in the target language. It is intended to provide repetition of the target vocabulary in context and enable students to learn the vocabulary, grammar and phonology of their new language in a holistic way. There are four basic types of circling questions: &quot;yes&quot; questions, &quot;no&quot; questions, either/or questions, and &quot;wh&quot; questions such as what, where, when, and how many. There are also more advanced circling techniques which teachers can optionally include, such as the &quot;three for one&quot; and false statements. The teacher expects a response from the students after each statement or question, to check whether they have understood. If the teacher says a statement, then the students show that they understand by responding with an expression of interest such as &quot;Oooh!&quot; or &quot;Aaaaah&quot;. If the teacher asks a question, then the students answer the question.

The students can answer the questions with just one or two words. The point of asking these questions is not to force the students to speak; rather, the questions are a method of checking comprehension while simultaneously repeating the target vocabulary in context. Therefore, students need not worry about speaking in full sentences, and indeed this would detract from the process of concentrating on the input provided by the teacher. By answering using single words or very short phrases the students can keep their attention focused on the words to be learned.

Circling questions are always about content that has already been established. If a question is about something not yet established, then it is not considered a &quot;circling&quot; question. Consider the example on the right, &quot;Dave wants a Ferrari.&quot; The following questions all ask for details not already established in the statement &quot;Dave wants a Ferrari&quot;, and so are not examples of circling questions:
* &quot;Teacher:&quot; Why does Dave want a Ferrari?
* &quot;Teacher:&quot; Where does Dave want to drive his Ferrari?

=== Staying in bounds ===
Staying in bounds means only using words that the students understand. Words that are in bounds are:
* Words that all the students have already learned
* Cognates
* Proper nouns that the students know

Any words not in the list above are considered &quot;out-of-bounds&quot;. Teachers must be on constant alert to keep their language in bounds. If a teacher does say something out-of-bounds, then the solution is to make it comprehensible, by writing it on the board and translating it immediately. If a teacher can stay in bounds all the time, and can speak slowly enough for the students to understand, then their class will be 100% comprehensible. This helps the students become confident in their language abilities and motivates them to succeed.

=== Slow ===
Even if students know the words that the teacher says, they will not understand if the teacher speaks too quickly. By speaking slowly, teachers give students more time to process the language and therefore they have more chance of understanding. When students first hear vocabulary or grammar, the necessary gap between each word can be as long as two full seconds. As students get used to the language structures, the teacher can slowly increase the speed.

=== Comprehension checks ===
The most direct way of finding out if students understand the language is to ask them what it means. In TPR Storytelling, teachers check comprehension early and often. There are a few ways of doing this:
;Time-out sign
:The teacher agrees on a sign for the students to use if they don&#x27;t understand something. This is intended to save them from being embarrassed about not knowing something they think everybody else understands.
;Finger count
:The students hold up their fingers to show how much they understand. Ten fingers means they understood 100%, seven fingers means they understood 70%, five fingers means 50%, etc.
;&quot;What does &lt;INSERT WORD HERE&gt; mean?&quot;
:The teacher asks the students what specific words mean. Teachers generally use this after they asked a circling question but didn&#x27;t get a strong response. This question is usually asked in the students&#x27; first language, to ensure understanding.
;&quot;What did I just say?&quot;
:The teacher asks the students &quot;What did I just say?&quot; in the students&#x27; first language. This way the students can be sure of the full meaning of the sentence or question they just heard. This should not be used as an attempt to catch students out; rather it is just a check to remind students of something they cannot remember at that moment.

=== Pop-up grammar ===
&quot;Pop-up grammar&quot; is the practice of making very short grammar explanations about the specific vocabulary students are learning at that moment. This technique is most often used in the class reading of step three, but it can be used at any time. The teacher draws the students&#x27; attention to a grammatical feature of one of the sentences they have been learning in the story, and explains it in five seconds or less. This brevity is intended to keep focus on the meaning of the language as much as possible.

=== Personalization ===
Personalizing the language class is a key way to make the target language interesting and meaningful for students, and personalization is used extensively in TPR Storytelling. A personalized message is much more likely to be comprehensible and interesting than one that is not personalized. Using this in classes can be as easy as asking students simple questions about their lives in the target language. Other good personalization techniques are the use of celebrities or of other characters the students know (such as the school principal).

=== Teach to the eyes ===
&quot;Teaching to the eyes&quot; is a way of connecting with students while talking to them in the foreign language. More importantly, looking the students directly in the eyes while speaking gives the teacher a good indication of whether or not they understand what is being said. As the name suggests, to do this teachers will look into the eyes of individual students while they teach. Teachers are encouraged to choose one student and talk to them directly. After they have finished talking to that student, they can pick another student in a different part of the room to talk to. Focusing attention on individual students like this helps teachers to assess student comprehension levels, and also keeps the teacher&#x27;s intonation conversational and interesting. It is also helpful in preventing problems with discipline. Students&#x27; eyes will reveal if they understand or if there needs to be more clarification.

== Teaching materials ==

A number of teaching materials have been developed for use with TPR Storytelling. There are books of suggested lesson plans, manuals explaining TPRS methodology, listening material, substitute DVDs, and many target language readers by a variety of authors and publishers. These readers have been translated into multiple languages and include appropriate cultural references for each target language. These materials are generally written by TPRS teachers themselves; so far, the large publishing companies have been reluctant to publish materials that aren&#x27;t based upon a fixed grammar syllabus. Small TPRS publishers like Command Performance Language Institute, TPRS Books, Fluency Fast, Fluency Matters, Chalkboard Productions and Albany Language Learning/Squid For Brains are appearing to fill the need for materials to fit the TPRS community. Newer, self-published novels can be found on Mike Peto&#x27;s blog.

== Conferences ==
There are three main U.S. conferences for TPRS teachers: NTPRS, which focuses on TPRS, and IFLT, which focuses on general comprehensible-input based instruction, and Comprehended World Languages, which focuses on TPRS/TCI and provides a lab teaching option. NTPRS stands for National TPRS. These conferences take place every year in the United States.

== Theory ==

TPR Storytelling is based on two key theoretical pillars: the input hypothesis, and mastery learning.

=== Input hypothesis ===
The Input Hypothesis, proposed by Dr. Stephen Krashen, suggests that language development is a function of the input received by the learner. Krashen asserts that there are two distinct ways of learning language: language &quot;learning&quot; and language &quot;acquisition&quot;. Language &quot;learning&quot; is learning that takes conscious effort on the part of the learner. It is characterized by learning grammar rules, memorizing vocabulary lists, and performing speaking drills. Language &quot;acquisition&quot; is learning that is subconscious and takes little or no effort on the part of the learner. It is characterized by listening to and understanding messages, reading interesting books and articles, and other enjoyable activities that take place in the language being learned. According to Krashen&#x27;s theory, the only thing that can lead to fluency in the language is language &quot;acquisition&quot;. Language &quot;learning&quot; can only be used as a way to consciously edit speech or writing, and it is never the cause of spontaneous, unrehearsed speech or writing.

In light of this theory, TPRS teachers spend the vast majority of their class time on input-based activities. The table below shows the activities used in TPR Storytelling, and whether they encourage language learning, language acquisition, or both. The activities that include a language learning component all take up a relatively short amount of class time. On the other hand, the pure acquisition activities take up large amounts of time. For typical TPRS classes, the ratio works out at about 5% of time spent on learning and 95% of time spent on acquisition.

==== The affective filter ====
Another key component of Krashen&#x27;s theory is the affective filter. The affective filter hypothesis states that language is more easily acquired when people are relaxed and open to learning. On the other hand, if people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety, self-doubt, and boredom, language is much less likely to be acquired.

For this reason TPRS teachers always try to make students look good in the stories and discussions. For example, an otherwise average student could be given the role of a star baseball pitcher in a class story. It is usually considered good form to make celebrities look bad in comparison to the students. The class story in question might see the pitcher winning a game against an all-star team of professional batters, ideally in a humorous way. This use of humor and making the students look good is built on the idea that students learn language better when they are enjoying themselves.

=== Mastery learning ===
Mastery learning is a method of instruction in which students thoroughly learn all material they are studying. Students do not progress on to learning new material until they have mastered current material. This gives students a feeling of control, and indeed, of mastery. In language learning this is particularly important, as this feeling of control is directly related to the ability to learn. This is demonstrated by Krashen&#x27;s research on the &quot;affective filter&quot;.

The mastery approach to learning manifests itself in TPR Storytelling in many ways. Firstly, the number of new vocabulary phrases to be learned in each lesson is usually no more than three. More words than this may be introduced during the lesson, but the three phrases are the only ones that the students will be &quot;expected&quot; to know. Secondly, these vocabulary phrases are repeated many, many times, in context, using the &quot;circling&quot; technique. This repetition helps the students to internalize the words thoroughly. In addition, the same words are used during the class reading, giving even more repetition. If after this the students still aren&#x27;t comfortable with the target words, the teacher can simply tell a new story using the same vocabulary phrases in the next lesson. Thirdly, teachers will try as far as possible to review all previously covered vocabulary in every lesson, finding ways to work the old vocabulary structures into class stories and class discussions.

== Research ==
In addition to the research backing up the general theoretical foundations of TPR Storytelling, that is, Krashen&#x27;s Input Hypothesis, there exist some studies dealing with TPRS specifically. The results of these studies indicate that TPR Storytelling may be more efficient, in some cases, than more traditional methods, like the Audio-Lingual Method (ALM). Todd McKay (2000) conducted the first empirical study of the effectiveness of Total Physical Response (TPR) combined with storytelling. Stories had been incorporated into TPR as early as 1972. In the comparative study with Asher, McKay found that children who were exposed to TPR Storytelling outperformed similar students trained using grammar-translation and ALM. The ability of those students to comprehend a never before heard story was statistically (p-value of 0.001) greater than that of the control group. This study can be found in Asher&#x27;s Learning Another Language Through Actions and in McKay&#x27;s TPR Storytelling Teacher&#x27;s Guidebook. In another example, Garczynski (2003) followed two groups of students over a six-week period, one of which was taught with TPR Storytelling, and the other of which was taught with the audio-lingual method. Both groups of students learned the same vocabulary from the same textbook. The students who learned with TPR Storytelling scored slightly higher than the students who learned with the audio-lingual method, and the TPR Storytelling students showed a much greater rate of improvement than their ALM peers. However, ALM was a method that lost popularity in the late 1950s, when it was strongly criticized for its lack of &quot;scientific credibility and it was only a matter of time before the effectiveness of the method itself was questioned.&quot; (Wikipedia: Audio-lingual method.) It should be clarified that TPRS, which stands for &quot;Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling, is not directly associated with &quot;Total Physical Response (TPR) in spite of the similarity of their names. James Asher, the creator of TPR in the 1960s, did compare his TPR with ALM with results showing TPR superiority over ALM. Asher&#x27;s study was performed in 1977, when it was still pertinent to compare new methods like TPR with old ones like ALM. Comparing TPRS, created in the 90s, with ALM, created in the 1960s, is not pertinent anymore. Not all research studies suggest a significant advantage for TPR Storytelling.

== Glossary ==
There are a number of terms that teachers use when talking about TPR Storytelling. Some of these are standard terms in teaching and others are specific to TPRS.

* Acquisition. This refers to the subconscious process of becoming fluent in a language. This term was popularized by Stephen Krashen, and is often contrasted with language learning, which Krashen uses to refer to the conscious process of learning a language. He argues that conscious language learning does not result in fluency.
* Barometer or barometer student. This is the student who has the most difficulty understanding the language in any given class, but who is actively trying. Teachers should go slow enough for this student to understand.
* CI - Comprehensible input. This refers to language which the students can understand.
* Circling. The practice of asking many easy questions about a statement. See the &quot;circling&quot; section above.
* Four-percenters. The estimated four percent of learners who choose to sign up for advanced courses, beyond the basic requirements to get into accredited colleges.
* FVR - Free voluntary reading. This means reading books for pleasure, without deadlines or assessments. See the &quot;free voluntary reading&quot; section above.
* Home-run story. This is a class story that goes particularly well. It is often a cause for celebration among teachers new to TPR Storytelling.
* Kindergarten day. This is the practice of teachers reading picture books to their students. See the &quot;kindergarten day&quot; section above.
* Parking. This is when the teacher stays focused on one sentence and gets many repetitions of the target vocabulary, rather than moving quickly through the story.
* Passive PMS. This is an outdated way of referring to PQA (Personalized questions and answers).
* PMS - Personalized mini-situation. This refers to the spoken class story of step two.
* Pop-ups or pop-up grammar. This refers to giving very short grammar explanations, usually five seconds or less. See the &quot;pop-up grammar&quot; section above.
* PQA - Personalized questions and answers. This is the practice of asking questions to the students about their lives using the day&#x27;s vocabulary structures. It is part of step one.
* Reps - Repetitions.
* Staying in bounds. This means only using words that the students know. See the &quot;Staying in bounds&quot; section above.
* Teach to the eyes. This is the practice of looking in students&#x27; eyes when talking to them, considered essential for building rapport. See the &quot;teach to the eyes&quot; section above.
* TPR - Total Physical Response. A language teaching method invented by Dr. James Asher where students respond to commands given in the target language.
* TPRS - Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling. The subject of this article. It is a language teaching method originally based on Total Physical Response, but that has evolved a separate methodology.

<doc id="531686" wikidata="Q514818" url="?curid=531686" title="Manchester Baby">
<text>The Manchester Baby, also called the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), was the first electronic stored-program computer. It was built at the University of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.

The Baby was not intended to be a practical computing engine, but was instead designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first truly random-access memory. Described as &quot;small and primitive&quot; 50 years after its creation, it was the first working machine to contain all the elements essential to a modern electronic digital computer. As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a full-scale operational machine, the . The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world&#x27;s first commercially available general-purpose computer.

The Baby had a 32-bit word length and a memory of 32 words (1 kilobit, 1,024 bits). As it was designed to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine calculated the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), by testing every integer from 218 downwards. This algorithm would take a long time to execute—and so prove the computer&#x27;s reliability, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17 instructions and ran for about 52 minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the Baby had performed about 3.5 million operations (for an effective CPU speed of about 1100 instructions per second).

== Background ==

The first design for a program-controlled computer was Charles Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine in the 1830s, with Ada Lovelace conceiving the idea of the first theoretical program to calculate Bernoulli numbers. A century later, in 1936, mathematician Alan Turing published his description of what became known as a Turing machine, a theoretical concept intended to explore the limits of mechanical computation. Turing was not imagining a physical machine, but a person he called a &quot;computer&quot;, who acted according to the instructions provided by a tape on which symbols could be read and written sequentially as the tape moved under a tape head. Turing proved that if an algorithm can be written to solve a mathematical problem, then a Turing machine can execute that algorithm.

Konrad Zuse&#x27;s Z3 was the world&#x27;s first working programmable, fully automatic computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, the Z3 was successfully presented to an audience of scientists of the &quot;Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt&quot; (&quot;German Laboratory for Aviation&quot;) in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The earliest electronic computing devices were the Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC), which was successfully tested in 1942, and the Colossus of 1943, but neither was a stored-program machine.

The ENIAC (1946) was the first automatic computer that was both electronic and general-purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve a wide range of problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patch cords, rather than machine-changeable memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer&#x27;s memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.
The construction of a von Neumann computer depended on the availability of a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay-line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.

Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in October 1945, by which time scientists within the Ministry of Supply had concluded that Britain needed a National Mathematical Laboratory to co-ordinate machine-aided computation. A Mathematics Division was set up at the NPL, and on 19 February 1946 Turing presented a paper outlining his design for an electronic stored-program computer to be known as the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). This was one of several projects set up in the years following the Second World War with the aim of constructing a stored-program computer. At about the same time, EDVAC was under development at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering, and the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory was working on EDSAC.

The NPL did not have the expertise to build a machine like ACE, so they contacted Tommy Flowers at the General Post Office&#x27;s (GPO) Dollis Hill Research Laboratory. Flowers, the designer of Colossus, the world&#x27;s first programmable electronic computer, was committed elsewhere and was unable to take part in the project, although his team did build some mercury delay lines for ACE. The Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) was also approached for assistance, as was Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory.

The government department responsible for the NPL decided that, of all the work being carried out by the TRE on its behalf, ACE was to be given the top priority. NPL&#x27;s decision led to a visit by the superintendent of the TRE&#x27;s Physics Division on 22 November 1946, accompanied by Frederic C. Williams and A. M. Uttley, also from the TRE. Williams led a TRE development group working on CRT stores for radar applications, as an alternative to delay lines. Williams was not available to work on the ACE because he had already accepted a professorship at the University of Manchester, and most of his circuit technicians were in the process of being transferred to the Department of Atomic Energy. The TRE agreed to second a small number of technicians to work under Williams&#x27; direction at the university, and to support another small group working with Uttley at the TRE.

== Williams–Kilburn tube ==

Although some early computers such as EDSAC, inspired by the design of EDVAC, later made successful use of mercury delay-line memory, the technology had several drawbacks: it was heavy, it was expensive, and it did not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device&#x27;s temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode-ray tubes (CRT) as an alternative to the delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams tube or Williams–Kilburn tube, based on a standard CRT: the first electronic random-access digital storage device. The Baby was designed to show that it was a practical storage device by demonstrating that data held within it could be read and written reliably at a speed suitable for use in a computer.

For use in a binary digital computer, the tube had to be capable of storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, corresponding to the binary digits (bits) 0 and 1. It exploited the positive or negative electric charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge 1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2 seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.

The Williams tube used in Baby was based on the CV1131, a commercially available diameter CRT, but a smaller tube, the CV1097, was used in the Mark I.

==Genesis of the project==
After developing the Colossus computer for code breaking at Bletchley Park during World War II, Max Newman was committed to the development of a computer incorporating both Alan Turing&#x27;s mathematical concepts and the stored-program concept that had been described by John von Neumann. In 1945, he was appointed to the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at Manchester University; he took his Colossus-project colleagues Jack Good and David Rees to Manchester with him, and there they recruited F. C. Williams to be the &quot;circuit man&quot; for a new computer project for which he had secured funding from the Royal Society.

Following his appointment to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By the autumn of 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the Williams tube from one bit to 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that it was able to store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.

Kilburn had a hard time recalling the influences on his machine design:

Jack Copeland explains that Kilburn&#x27;s first (pre-Baby) accumulator-free (decentralized, in Jack Good&#x27;s nomenclature) design was based on inputs from Turing, but that he later switched to an accumulator-based (centralized) machine of the sort advocated by von Neumann, as written up and taught to him by Jack Good and Max Newman.

The Baby&#x27;s seven operation instruction set was approximately a subset of the twelve operation instruction set proposed in 1947 by Jack Good, in the first known document to use the term &quot;Baby&quot; for this machine. Good did not include a &quot;halt&quot; instruction, and his proposed conditional jump instruction was more complicated than what the Baby implemented.

== Development and design ==

Although Newman played no engineering role in the development of the Baby, or any of the subsequent Manchester computers, he was generally supportive and enthusiastic about the project, and arranged for the acquisition of war-surplus supplies for its construction, including GPO metal racks and &quot;…the material of two complete Colossi&quot; from Bletchley. Racks and Colossi parts were modified and assembled into chassis by Norman Stanley Hammond and others.

By June 1948 the Baby had been built and was working. It was in length, tall, and weighed almost . The machine contained 550 valves (vacuum tubes)—300 diodes and 250 pentodes—and had a power consumption of 3500 watts. The arithmetic unit was built using EF50 pentode valves, which had been widely used during wartime. The Baby used one Williams tube to provide 32 by 32-bit words of random-access memory (RAM), a second to hold a 32-bit accumulator in which the intermediate results of a calculation could be stored temporarily, and a third to hold the current program instruction along with its address in memory. A fourth CRT, without the storage electronics of the other three, was used as the output device, able to display the bit pattern of any selected storage tube.
Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain either a program instruction or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory address of the operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16 bits were unused. The Baby&#x27;s single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only the address of the data in memory.

A word in the computer&#x27;s memory could be read, written, or refreshed, in 360 microseconds. An instruction took four times as long to execute as accessing a word from memory, giving an instruction execution rate of about 700 per second. The main store was refreshed continuously, a process that took 20 milliseconds to complete, as each of the Baby&#x27;s 32 words had to be read and then refreshed in sequence.

The Baby represented negative numbers using two&#x27;s complement, as most computers still do. In that representation, the value of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus, the range of numbers that could be held in each 32-bit word was −231 to +231 − 1 (decimal: −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647).

== Programming ==
The Baby&#x27;s instruction format had a three-bit operation code field, which allowed a maximum of eight (23) different instructions. In contrast to the modern convention, the machine&#x27;s storage was described with the least significant digits to the left; thus a one was represented in three bits as &quot;100&quot;, rather than the more conventional &quot;001&quot;.

The awkward negative operations were a consequence of the Baby&#x27;s lack of hardware to perform any arithmetic operations except subtraction and negation. It was considered unnecessary to build an adder before testing could begin as addition can easily be implemented by subtraction, i.e. &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot; can be computed as −(−&quot;x&quot;−&quot;y&quot;). Therefore, adding two numbers together, X and Y, required four instructions:

Programs were entered in binary form by stepping through each word of memory in turn, and using a set of 32 buttons and switches known as the input device to set the value of each bit of each word to either 0 or 1. The Baby had no paper-tape reader or punch.

=== First programs ===

Three programs were written for the computer. The first, consisting of 17 instructions, was written by Kilburn, and so far as can be ascertained first ran on 21 June 1948. It was designed to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The divisions were implemented by repeated subtractions of the divisor. The Baby took 3.5 million operations and 52 minutes to produce the answer (131,072). The program used eight words of working storage in addition to its 17 words of instructions, giving a program size of 25 words.

Geoff Tootill wrote an amended version of the program the following month, and in mid-July Alan Turing — who had been appointed as a reader in the mathematics department at Manchester University in September 1948 — submitted the third program, to carry out long division. Turing had by then been appointed to the nominal post of Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory at the university, although the laboratory did not become a physical reality until 1951.

== Later developments ==
Williams and Kilburn reported on the Baby in a letter to the Journal &quot;Nature&quot;, published in September 1948. The machine&#x27;s successful demonstration quickly led to the construction of a more practical computer, the , work on which began in August 1948. The first version was operational by April 1949, and it in turn led directly to the development of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world&#x27;s first commercially available general-purpose computer.

==Legacy==

In 1998, a working replica of the Baby, now on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, was built to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the running of its first program. Demonstrations of the machine in operation are held regularly at the museum. 

In 2008, an original panoramic photograph of the entire machine was discovered at the University of Manchester. The photograph, taken on 15 December 1948 by a research student, Alec Robinson, had been reproduced in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; in June 1949.

<text>The America East Conference (AmEast) is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with NCAA Division I whose members are located in the Northeastern United States. The conference is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.

Founded in 1979, the conference has nine core members including eight public research universities, three of which - the University of Maine, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Vermont - are the flagship universities of their states. Two non-flagship university centers of the State University of New York - the University at Albany and Binghamton University - are in the conference along with UMass Lowell, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and Bryant University. Bryant is the latest institution to join the conference in 2022, when Stony Brook University and the University of Hartford departed the conference. It is the only private university among the core members.

The America East Conference sponsors 18 sports (8 men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s). The conference is among the best in the country according to Graduation Success Rate (GSR) data released by the NCAA.

==History==

The America East Conference was founded as the Eastern College Athletic Conference-North, a men&#x27;s basketball-only athletic conference, in 1979. The conference was known as the Eastern College Athletic Conference-North from 1979 to 1988 and the North Atlantic Conference from 1988 to 1996. The charter members were the University of Rhode Island, the College of the Holy Cross, Canisius College, Niagara University, Colgate University, Northeastern University, Boston University, the University of Maine, the University of New Hampshire and the University of Vermont. 
The America East Conference made history during the 2018 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament on March 16, 2018, when No. 16 seed UMBC defeated No. 1 seed Virginia, marking the first time in men&#x27;s tournament history that a No. 1 seed had lost to a No. 16 seed.

Many other events have occurred since its formation:
* Rhode Island left in 1980.
* Holy Cross left in 1983.
* Siena College joined in 1984.
* The University of Hartford joined in 1985.
* The conference became an all-sports conference, named the North Atlantic Conference, in the 1988–89 season, only for Canisius, Niagara and Siena to leave after the spring of 1989 to join the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC).
* Colgate left in 1990 to join the Patriot League.
* The University of Delaware and Drexel University joined in 1991.
* Hofstra University joined in 1994.
* Towson University joined in 1995.
* On July 1, 1996, the conference&#x27;s name changed to its present name, the America East Conference.
* During 2001, Delaware, Drexel, Hofstra and Towson left to join the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA; now the Coastal Athletic Association) while the University at Albany, Binghamton University and Stony Brook University replaced them.
* The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) soon joined in 2003.
* Northeastern left in 2005 to join the CAA.
* Boston University left to join the Patriot League on July 1, 2013, while the University of Massachusetts Lowell joined from Division II.
* In 2020, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) joined from the ASUN Conference.
* In March 2022, Bryant University accepted an invitation to join the America East Conference, leaving the Northeast Conference. This move took effect on July 1.
* On July 1, 2022, Stony Brook University left to join the all-sports Colonial Athletic Association (now the Coastal Athletic Association); it had been a member of the CAA&#x27;s technically separate football arm, CAA Football, since 2013. Then-current field hockey associate Monmouth left to join the CAA, which sponsors that sport.
* In 2022, the University of Hartford left the conference during its transition down to Division III. At the time this move was announced, the school&#x27;s departure from the conference had been planned for 2023, but this was eventually changed to 2022.

On May 6, 2021, Hartford&#x27;s governing board voted to begin the process of transitioning the school from Division I to NCAA Division III. Under the plan, Hartford would formally apply to the NCAA for reclassification in January 2022, stop awarding athletic scholarships to incoming students from 2022–23 forward, and join an as-yet-undetermined D-III conference in 2023 before becoming a full D-III member in 2025–26.

Several media reports indicated that Hartford&#x27;s last year in the American East Conference would be the 2021–22 season.
 This was confirmed on June 21, 2022, when the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC; now known as the Conference of New England) announced that it would be Hartford&#x27;s partner in the school&#x27;s reclassification process, with the Hawks joining that league effective in 2023–24. Hartford played most of its sports in the 2022–23 season as a D-I independent.

At the time, Hartford was the only private university in the conference; this status transferred to Bryant when it joined in July 2022.

On July 20, 2022, the conference announced that Merrimack College would join as a men&#x27;s lacrosse member for the 2022–23 season.

Two schools currently hold associate membership: one from California and one from Virginia 

;Notes:


===Former full members===


===Former associate members===
Eight schools have had single-sport membership in the past. Three of these, Fairfield, Monmouth, and Providence, moved their America East sports into their all-sports conferences. Another such school, NJIT, left when it joined a conference that sponsored its America East sport, but returned as a full member in July 2020 (by which time the AmEast had dropped that sport). Pacific dropped its America East sport following the 2018–19 academic year due to budget cuts. Merrimack College dropped its America East sport following the 2023–24 academic year when the school joined the MAAC. Both Stanford and Cal moved their America East sports into the ACC following the 2023–24 academic year when both of the schools joined the conference.

==Sports sponsored==
The America East Conference sponsors championship competition in eight men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. The most recent changes to the roster of America East sports were announced in 2016, with the dropping of women&#x27;s tennis after the 2015–16 season due to a lack of sponsoring teams and the revival of men&#x27;s swimming and diving effective in the 2017–18 school year.

<doc id="531691" wikidata="Q888113" url="?curid=531691" title="Raymond-Roupen">
<text>Raymond-Roupen (also Raymond-Rupen and Ruben-Raymond; 1198 – 1219 or 1221/1222) was a member of the House of Poitiers who claimed the thrones of the Principality of Antioch and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. His succession in Antioch was prevented by his paternal uncle Bohemond IV, but his maternal great-uncle Leo I of Cilicia recognized him as heir presumptive to Cilicia and pressed his claim to Antioch. In 1211 Raymond-Roupen was crowned junior king of Cilicia, and was finally installed as Prince of Antioch in 1216. The War of the Antiochene Succession ended with Leo&#x27;s death in 1219, shortly before Raymond-Roupen was ousted from Antioch. He then pursued his claim to Cilicia, which Leo had unexpectedly willed to his daughter Isabella on his deathbed, but was defeated and imprisoned until death.

== Succession uncertainty ==
The marriage of Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s parents, Raymond of Antioch and Alice of Armenia, was arranged in 1195 to end the hostilities between the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and the Latin Principality of Antioch and to eventually unite them under one ruler. The idea failed when Raymond died in early 1197, leaving Alice pregnant. She gave birth to a posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. The infant was heir apparent to his grandfather Bohemond III of Antioch by primogeniture, but this principle was not upheld in the Latin East. Instead, the fiefs passed by the proximity of blood, which favored Bohemond III&#x27;s surviving children. Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s grandfather was elderly and unlikely to live until Raymond-Roupen reached the age of majority, making an undesirable Armenian-dominated regency likely if Raymond-Roupen were to succeed him.
Bohemond sent his widowed daughter-in-law back to Cilicia along with his newborn grandson, either to ensure their safety or to remove the grandson from succession in favor of a son by his latest marriage. The two arrived just in time for the coronation of Alice&#x27;s uncle, Leo I, as the first king of Cilicia. The ceremony was combined with Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s baptism, and both were performed by the papal legate Conrad of Wittelsbach. Leo, who had no sons, recognized Raymond-Roupen as his heir presumptive, and made it his principal mission to secure his grandnephew&#x27;s succession to Antioch as well.

Conrad of Wittelsbach traveled from Sis to Antioch, where he compelled Bohemond III to summon his vassals and have Raymond-Roupen recognized as his heir apparent. Bohemond III&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Bohemond, who was already ruling the County of Tripoli, immediately denounced the oaths of allegiance given to Raymond-Roupen. Having secured the support of the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, the Genoese and Pisan merchants, and the Commune of Antioch, Bohemond suddenly appeared in Antioch in late 1198, ejected his father and had the commune swear allegiance to himself as the future prince. The Antiochene clergy too abandoned Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s cause after Leo fell out with Peter of Angoulême, Latin Patriarch of Antioch.

== War of the Antiochene Succession ==

When Bohemond III died in April 1201, Bohemond IV had no difficulty establishing himself as Prince of Antioch. Many noblemen who had favored Raymond-Roupen fled to Sis. Leo laid siege to the city of Antioch, starting the War of the Antiochene Succession. Amalric, King of Jerusalem and Cyprus, favored Raymond-Roupen but declined to intervene. Leo arranged for Raymond-Roupen to marry Helvis, Amalric&#x27;s daughter and sister of King Hugh I of Cyprus, in 1210. On 15 August 1211, Raymond-Roupen was crowned as junior king of Cilicia, with a crown sent by Emperor Otto IV. The following year, when he was about to reach the age of majority, Raymond-Roupen was sent by Leo to plunder Antioch.

Raymond-Roupen found new allies in the Hospitallers and Antiochene noblemen, including the leader of the commune, by promising grants of land. In this too he was supported by Leo. In early 1216, Antioch was finally occupied. Raymond-Roupen and Leo entered the city on 14 February, while Bohemond was absent. Raymond-Roupen was consecrated as Prince of Antioch by the Latin Patriarch, Peter of Ivrea, and received the submission of the nobility and the commune. The Seljuk Turks promptly attacked Cilicia, and Raymond-Roupen may have been asked to assist his granduncle. Their relationship, however, deteriorated and Raymond-Roupen intended to capture Leo. The latter was warned by the Templars and escaped to Cilicia. Without Leo&#x27;s backing, Raymond-Roupen could not hold Antioch. He helped the Hospitallers occupy Jableh in 1218 but found himself lacking resources, as the principality had been devastated by the war. An increase of taxation made him unpopular among his subjects.

In 1219, the burghers and noblemen of Antioch rose up and persuaded Bohemond to return. On his uncle&#x27;s arrival, Raymond-Roupen sought refuge in the citadel but then fled to Cilicia. He left the citadel in the hands of the Hospitallers, earning their friendship.

== Cilician claim ==

Once ousted from Antioch, Raymond-Roupen sought shelter with Leo in Cilicia. His granduncle was on his deathbed, however, and decided to disinherit Raymond-Roupen in favor of his infant daughter Isabella. Prince Bohemond IV&#x27;s restoration, followed by King Leo I&#x27;s death in May 1219, thus ended Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s prospects of ruling Antioch. Raymond-Roupen instead rose to claim Cilicia, as did John of Brienne, husband of Leo&#x27;s elder daughter, Stephanie. Pope Honorius III ruled that Stephanie or her son by John should succeed King Leo, but both mother and child died soon after. Honorius then ruled in favor of Raymond-Roupen.

Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s chances of winning the Cilician throne seemed good: he had the support of his mother, Alice; of some Cilician nobles; of the Hospitallers; of the papacy and of the papal legate Pelagius of Albano, who was leading the Fifth Crusade in Egypt. Raymond-Roupen traveled to Damietta in the summer of 1220 to consult with Pelagius in person, after which he invaded Cilicia with his mother. They established themselves in Tarsus, where they waited for help from the Hospitallers. Constantine of Baberon, regent for Queen Isabella, quickly marched to their stronghold. After a three-month siege, Tarsus was captured together with Raymond-Roupen and Alice.

== Aftermath == 

Raymond-Roupen died in a Cilician prison in 1221 or 1222. He was in his mid-twenties. Isabella and Bohemond were left to reign uncontested in Cilicia and Antioch, respectively, and shortly thereafter Bohemond&#x27;s son Philip became king by marrying Isabella, but met a similar fate. Honorius and Pelagius decided not to put forward the claims of Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s young daughters, Maria and Eschiva, who were taken by their mother to Cyprus.

<text>On Aggression (, &quot;So-called Evil: on the natural history of aggression&quot;) is a 1963 book by the ethologist Konrad Lorenz; it was translated into English in 1966. As he writes in the prologue, &quot;the subject of this book is &quot;aggression&quot;, that is to say the fighting instinct in beast and man which is directed &quot;against &quot; members of the same species.&quot; (Page 3)

The book was reviewed many times, both positively and negatively, by biologists, anthropologists, psychoanalysts and others. Much criticism was directed at Lorenz&#x27;s extension of his findings on non-human animals to humans.

==Publication==

&quot;On Aggression&quot; was first published in German in 1963, and in English in 1966. It has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 12 languages.

==Content==

===Programming===
According to Lorenz, animals, particularly males, are biologically programmed to fight over resources. This behavior must be considered part of natural selection, as aggression leading to death or serious injury may eventually lead to extinction unless it has such a role.

However, Lorenz does &quot;not&quot; state that aggressive behaviors are in any way more powerful, prevalent, or intense than more peaceful behaviors such as mating rituals. Rather, he negates the categorization of aggression as &quot;contrary&quot; to &quot;positive&quot; instincts like love, depicting it as a founding basis of other instincts and its role in animal communication.

===Hydraulic model===

Additionally, Lorenz addresses behavior in humans, including discussion of a &quot;hydraulic&quot; model of emotional or instinctive pressures and their release, shared by Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic theory, and the abnormality of intraspecies violence and killing. Lorenz claimed that &quot;present-day civilized man suffers from insufficient discharge of his aggressive drive&quot; and suggested that low levels of aggressive behaviour prevented higher level responses resulting from &quot;damming&quot; them. His &#x27;hydraulic&#x27; model, of aggression as a force that builds relentlessly without cause unless released, remains less popular than a model in which aggression is a response to frustrated desires and aims. 

===Ritualization===
In the book, Lorenz describes the development of rituals among aggressive behaviors as beginning with a totally utilitarian action, but then evolving to more and more stylized actions, until finally, the action performed may be entirely symbolic and non-utilitarian, now fulfilling a function of communication. In Lorenz&#x27;s words:

==Reception==

===Favourable===

J. L. Fischer, reviewing &quot;On Aggression&quot; in &quot;American Anthropologist&quot; in 1968, called it a &quot;fascinating book by a distinguished animal ethologist&quot; that would &quot;annoy most social and cultural anthropologists&quot; but nonetheless stated &quot;an important thesis&quot;, namely that intraspecific aggression was &quot;instinctive in man, as it can be shown to be in a number of other species.&quot; Fischer found Lorenz&#x27;s account of nonhuman animals at the start of the book, written from Lorenz&#x27;s own experience, &quot;the most convincing and enlightening&quot;. Fischer noted that Lorenz acknowledges the role of culture in human life but that he perhaps underrated its effects on individual development. Fischer argued that Lorenz&#x27;s view of the instinctive nature of human aggression was &quot;basically right&quot;, commenting that &quot;Lorenz would probably cite the fury of his critics as further proof of the correctness of his thesis&quot;.

Edmund R. Leach, comparing the book with Robert Ardrey&#x27;s &quot;The Territorial Imperative&quot; in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 1966, calls &quot;On Aggression&quot; &quot;no landmark, but .. modest and wise, while Ardrey&#x27;s version is only noisy and foolish.&quot; Leach writes that where Ardrey focuses on territoriality, Lorenz aims to demonstrate that &quot;animal aggression is only a &#x27;so-called evil&#x27; and that its adaptive consequences are advantageous or at least neutral.&quot; Leach is however less sure that Lorenz is correct to equate animal and human aggression, the one taking standard ritualized forms, the other far more complex.

The mental health researcher Peter M. Driver reviewed the book in &quot;Conflict Resolution&quot; in 1967 alongside two by Ardrey and one by Claire Russell and W. M. S. Russell, &quot;Human Behavior – A New Approach&quot;. He commented that those against the book, especially S. A. Barnett, T. C. Schneirla, and Solly Zuckerman, were specialists in animal behaviour, while most of the favourable reviews came from &quot;experts in other fields&quot;. Driver stated that Lorenz had provided a &quot;powerful thesis&quot; to explain the &quot;aggression gone wrong&quot; in humans, mentioning the millions of deaths in world wars, aggression resembling (Driver argued) the unlimited interspecific attack of a predator on its prey rather than the kind of intraspecific aggression seen in nonhuman animals which is strictly limited. Driver concluded that ethology could contribute, alongside neurophysiology and psychology, to resolving the problem of conflict.

===Critical===

The zoologists Richard D. Alexander and Donald W. Tinkle, comparing &quot;On Aggression&quot; with Ardrey&#x27;s &quot;The Territorial Imperative&quot; in &quot;BioScience&quot; in 1968, noted that few books had been reviewed so often &quot;or with as much vehemence in both defense and derogation&quot; as these two. In their view, this was because both men had tried to write about a sensitive and important question, human nature and to what extent it is determined by evolution. They call &quot;On Aggression&quot; a personal commentary from a professional zoologist where Ardrey&#x27;s book is a well-documented book by a non-biologist. Both, in their view, tend &quot;to rekindle old, pointless arguments of the instinct vs. learning variety&quot; and both include &quot;some peculiarly nonevolutionary or antievolutionary themes.&quot;

The psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1972, called Lorenz&#x27;s theory &quot;complicated and sometimes fuzzy&quot;. Fromm considered that in one way Lorenz had succeeded where Sigmund Freud had failed, Lorenz&#x27;s hydraulic theory of aggression, innately programmed, being in Fromm&#x27;s view a better explanation than Freud&#x27;s opposed passions, the supposed drives for life (eros) and death or destruction (thanatos). However, Fromm noted that the ethologist Nico Tinbergen had rejected the hydraulic theory, and that Lorenz himself &quot;modified it&quot; in 1966, but without indicating that in the English translation of &quot;On Aggression&quot;. Fromm cites evidence from neuroscience that aggression is &quot;essentially defensive&quot;, arising in &quot;phylogenetically programed brain areas&quot; for fight or flight when an animal or person feels threatened. Fromm points out that &quot;self-propelling aggressiveness&quot; is seen in people with brain disease, but not in &quot;normal brain functioning&quot;. 

The biologist E. O. Wilson, in &quot;On Human Nature&quot; (1978), argues that both Lorenz and Fromm are essentially wrong. He lists a variety of aggression categories, each separately subject to natural selection, and states that aggressive behavior is, genetically, one of the most of all traits. He maintains that aggression is a technique used to gain control over necessary resources, and serves as a &quot;density-dependent factor&quot; in population control. He argues against the &quot;drive-discharge&quot; model created by Freud and Lorenz, where substitute aggressive activities (such as combative sports) should reduce the potential for war, and in support of Richard G. Sipes&#x27;s &quot;culture-pattern&quot; model, where war and substitute activities will vary directly. Wilson compares aggression to &quot;a preexisting mix of chemicals ready to be transformed by specific catalysts that are added,&quot; rather than &quot;a fluid that continuously builds pressure against the walls of its containers.&quot;

The anthropologist Donald Symons, in &quot;The Evolution of Human Sexuality&quot; (1979), accused Lorenz of inadequately documenting his major thesis.

The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins described Lorenz in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976) as a &quot;&#x27;good of the species&#x27; man&quot;. He criticises &quot;On Aggression&quot; for its &quot;gem of a circular argument&quot; that aggressive behaviour has a &quot;species preserving&quot; function, namely to ensure &quot;that only the fittest individuals are allowed to breed&quot;. In Dawkins&#x27;s view, the idea of group selection was &quot;so deeply ingrained&quot; in Lorenz&#x27;s thinking that he &quot;evidently did not realize that his statements contravened orthodox Darwinian theory.&quot;

<text>Artemisia tridentata, commonly called big sagebrush, Great Basin sagebrush or simply sagebrush (one of several related species of this name), is an aromatic shrub from the family Asteraceae.

It grows in arid and semi-arid conditions, throughout a range of cold desert, steppe, and mountain habitats in the Intermountain West of North America. Big sagebrush and other &quot;Artemisia&quot; shrubs are the dominant plant species across large portions of the Great Basin.

Sagebrush provides food and habitat for a variety of species, such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, grey vireo, pygmy rabbit, and mule deer. Several major threats exist to sagebrush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, invasive plant species, and wildfires.

Native Americans have used the plant medicinally. It is also useful as firewood.

==Description==
Big sagebrush is a coarse, many-branched, pale-grey shrub with yellow flowers and silvery-grey foliage, which is generally tall. A deep taproot in length, coupled with laterally spreading roots near the surface, allows sagebrush to gather water from both surface precipitation and the water table several meters beneath. Big sagebrush that is over a meter tall is an indicator of arable land, because it prefers deep, basic soils. Sagebrush is generally long-lived once it makes it past the seedling stage, and can reach ages of over 100 years.

The species has a strong pungent fragrance (especially when wet) due to the presence of camphor, terpenoids and other volatile oils. The taste is bitter and, together with the odor, serves to discourage browsing by many herbivores. It is an evergreen shrub, keeping some of its leaves year-round (although it loses many of them in the late summer). The leaves—attached to the branches at the axillary nodes—are wedge-shaped, long and 0.3–1 cm broad, with the wider outer tips divided into three lobes (hence the scientific name &quot;tridentata&quot;). The leaves are covered with fine silvery hairs.

The plant flowers in the late summer or early fall. The small yellow flowers are in long, loosely arranged tubular clusters. The fruits are seed-like and have a small amount of hairs on the surface.

Big sagebrush can also reproduce through sprouts, which shoot up from the underground rhizome. The sprouts are an extension of the parental plant while seedlings are completely individualistic to any other plant. Among these two strategies, the seedlings need more moisture for germination and early survival. This is due to the sprouts being connected to already healthy and associated plants while the new seedlings will start anew.

=== Chemistry ===
Sagebrush essential oil contains approximately 40% &quot;l&quot;-camphor; 20% pinene; 7% cineole; 5% methacrolein; and 12% &quot;a&quot;-terpinene, &quot;d&quot;-camphor, and sesqiterpenoids.

== Taxonomy ==
Much discussion and disagreement revolves around the question of how to divide the species into varieties and subgenera. The following subspecies are accepted by some authors, though others advocate different systems.
* A. tridentata&quot; subsp. &quot;tridentata (&quot;basin big sagebrush&quot;)
* A. tridentata&quot; subsp. &quot;vaseyana (&quot;mountain big sagebrush&quot;)
* A. tridentata&quot; subsp. &quot;wyomingensis (&quot;Wyoming big sagebrush&quot;) – Found in the drier portions of the sagebrush steppe. Shrub density is generally less than 1 plant/m2, with little herbaceous cover surrounding the shrub.
* A. tridentata&quot; subsp. &quot;xericensis (&quot;scabland big sagebrush&quot;)
* A. tridentata&quot; subsp. &quot;spiciformis (&quot;subalpine big sagebrush&quot;)
* A. tridentata&quot; subsp. &quot;parishii (&quot;Parish&#x27;s big sagebrush&quot;)

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot; grows in arid and semi-arid conditions, throughout the Intermountain West of North America. Sagebrush is not a desert plant, but rather a resident of the steppe, in areas that receive of annual precipitation. Big sagebrush and other &quot;Artemisia&quot; species are the dominant plants across large portions of the Great Basin, covering some in 11 western U.S. states and Canadian provinces. The range extends northward through British Columbia&#x27;s southern interior, south into Baja California, and east into the western Great Plains of New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.

== Ecology ==

Sagebrush provides food and habitat for a variety of animal species, such as sage grouse, pronghorn, gray vireo, pygmy rabbit, and mule deer. It is especially important to game animals during the winter. Sagebrush also creates habitat for many species of grasses and herbs. Besides providing shade and shelter from the wind, the long taproot of sagebrush draws water up from deep in the soil, some of which becomes available to these surrounding shallow-rooted plants.

The terpenoid compounds in big sagebrush are thought to ward off herbivores. These oils, at high concentrations, are toxic to the symbiotic bacteria in the rumen of some ruminants like deer and cattle. Pronghorn are the only large herbivore to browse sagebrush extensively. Damage to sagebrush plants caused by grazing herbivores results in the release of volatile chemicals, which are used to signal a warning to nearby plants, so that they can increase the production of repellent chemical compounds. This plant-to-plant communication can take place at distances of up to .

Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, invasive plant species, wildfires, and climate change. Due to large periods of time where sagebrush was the primary shrub, many species have become adapted to this habitat. The burning of the shrubs leads to habitat loss of many species and can be very detrimental to the ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, the destruction of native grasses and forbs by grazing and fire creates conditions where invasive plants colonize the area. The invasive species which has destroyed the largest amount of sagebrush habitat is cheatgrass (&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;). Since its accidental introduction in the 1890s, cheatgrass has radically altered the native shrub ecosystem by replacing indigenous vegetation, and by creating a fire cycle that is too frequent to allow sagebrush to re-establish itself. Sagebrush lacks fire tolerance and relies on wind-blown seeds from outside the burned area for re-establishment. Some tree species have also encroached on big sagebrush habitat. For example, in the late 20th century, &quot;Abies concolor&quot; (white fir) was out-competing big sagebrush in Warner Mountains in California.

=== Galls ===
This species is host to the following insect induced galls:
* &quot;Eutreta diana&quot; fly bud gall
* &quot;Eutreta divisa&quot; fly bud gall
* &quot;Eutreta oregona&quot; fly bud gall
* &quot;Eutreta pollinosa&quot; fly bud? gall
* &quot;Oxyna aterrima&quot; fly bud gall
* &quot;Rhopalomyia (ampullaria, anthoides, brevibulla,calvipomum, conica, cramboides,culmata, florella, gossypina, hirticaulis, hirtipomum, lignea, lignitubus, mammilla, medusa, medusirrasa, nucula, obovata, occidentalis, pomum, rugosa, tridentatae, tubulus, tumidibulla, tumidicaulis)&quot; Various gall midges.

==Uses==
The Cahuilla used to gather large quantities of sagebrush seed and grind it to make flour. The main modern use is as firewood, with the wood&#x27;s oils being particularly flammable.

=== Medicinal ===
The plant&#x27;s active medicinal constituents include camphor, terpenoids, and tannins.

It is used as a herbal medicine by Native Americans throughout the Intermountain West of North America, most notably as a smudging herb. It is also used for preventing infection in wounds, stopping internal bleeding, and treating headaches and colds.

The Navajo use the vapors of sagebrush as a treatment for headache. The Okanagan and Colville people used sagebrush to smoke hides.

Among the Zuni people, an infusion of the leaves is used externally for body aches. The infusion is also taken as a cold medicine. It is also placed in shoes to treat athlete&#x27;s foot, fissures between toes, and as a foot deodorant.

==Culture==
&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot; is the state flower of Nevada.

<text>Karl, 8th Prince Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau (; 29 November 185811 December 1919) was the 8th Prince Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau.

==Early life==
Karl was born in Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, as the son of Ferdinand Bonaventura, 7th Prince Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau (1834–1904), the head of the princely line of the House of Kinsky, and Princess Marie of Liechtenstein (1835–1905).

Karl was born into the family&#x27;s great equine tradition and inherited a love of horses. A servant, the Kinskys’ master of the horse, Rowland Reynolds, who had two great loves, England and the Grand National steeplechase, was to prove a great influence on Karl, passing on his passions to the young Count.

Karl first visited England as part of the retinue of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the late 1870s. The Empress arranged to visit Liverpool and see the famous steeplechase which provided Kinsky with his first opportunity to witness the event. Later, in 1882, he bought the 3rd-place horse in the 1882 Grand National, 5-year-old mare Zoedone and won on her the following year.

==Marriage==
Karl married on 7 January 1895 in Herdringen, Arnsberg, to Countess Elisabeth Wolff-Metternich zur Gracht (1874–1909). They had no children.

==Ambitions==
Karl achieved his two greatest British goals in rapid succession. First, he was made Austro-Hungarian attaché to Britain; and second, he rode his own horse, Zoedone, to win the 1883 Grand National. He was distraught when Zoedone was poisoned on the race day two years later.

===Relationship with Jennie Jerome===

Karl was involved in an affair with Lady Randolph Churchill, wife of Lord Randolph Churchill and the American-born mother of Sir Winston Churchill. She was four years his senior, a famous socialite, and one of the most beautiful women of the time, and he was completely infatuated by her. Lady Randolph Churchill has been described as being a captivating woman, whose looks and demeanor made her almost irresistible. She was powerful, having social and romantic contacts that could make or break anyone wishing to climb in social status in the Britain of the time.

She later claimed that she would not have spent the time that she did with Kinsky were it not for the unfounded rumours of an affair being spread by society gossips, and her desire to spend time with him was simply for spite. However, accounts from the time do indicate that the two were involved romantically, and the only motivation for quelling the rumours was that this affair was a semi-secret one.

In this period, having extra-marital affairs was not uncommon among the upper classes. Her affairs were rumored to have included The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). Her affairs may have even assisted Lord Randolph’s political and social standing. At the time of Kinsky&#x27;s affair with Jennie Churchill, she likely wielded more power behind the scenes than did Kinsky, and it would have been he who would have benefited more from the affair. Although she certainly had friendships with many powerful men, it is unknown whether every relationship was sexual.

===World War I and after===

Karl remained in England until 1914 when Austria-Hungary went to war with Britain. Keen to do his duty, but unwilling to fight the country he regarded as his second home, Kinsky volunteered to fight on the dreaded Russian front. He survived but returned to a broken homeland and the knowledge that it was unlikely he would ever be welcome in England again. A broken man, Karl died in 1919.

==Popular culture==

He is portrayed in the 1974 television series, &quot;&quot;, by the actor Jeremy Brett.

<text>Kurt Alois Josef Johann von Schuschnigg (; 14 December 1897 – 18 November 1977) was an Austrian politician who was the Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Nazi Germany. Although Schuschnigg considered Austria a &quot;German state&quot; and Austrians to be Germans, he was strongly opposed to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s goal to absorb Austria into the Third Reich and wished for it to remain independent.

When Schuschnigg&#x27;s efforts to keep Austria independent had failed, he resigned his office. After the Anschluss he was arrested, kept in solitary confinement, and eventually interned in various concentration camps. He was liberated in 1945 by the advancing United States Army and spent most of the rest of his life in academia in the United States. Schuschnigg gained American citizenship in 1956.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Schuschnigg was born in Reiff am Gartsee (now Riva del Garda) in the Tyrolean crown land of Austria-Hungary (now in Trentino, Italy), the son of Anna Josefa Amalia (Wopfner) and Austrian General Artur von Schuschnigg, member of a long-established Austrian officers&#x27; family of Carinthian Slovene descent. The Slovene spelling of the family name is &quot;Šušnik&quot;.

He received his education at the Stella Matutina Jesuit College in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. During World War I, he was taken prisoner at the Italian Front and held captive until September 1919. Subsequently, he studied law at the University of Freiburg and the University of Innsbruck, where he became a member of the Catholic fraternity A.V. Austria. After graduating in 1922, he practiced as a lawyer in Innsbruck.

=== Political career ===
Schuschnigg first joined the right-wing Christian Social Party and in 1927 was elected to the Nationalrat, then the youngest parliamentary deputy. Suspicious of the paramilitary &quot;Heimwehr&quot; organisation, he established the Catholic &quot;Ostmärkische Sturmscharen&quot; forces in 1930. 

On 29 January 1932, the Christian Social chancellor Karl Buresch appointed Schuschnigg Minister of Justice, an office he retained in the cabinet of Buresch&#x27;s successor Engelbert Dollfuss, and he also served as Minister of Education from 24 May 1933. As justice minister, he openly discussed the abolition of the parliamentary system and restored the death penalty. In March 1933, he and Chancellor Dollfuss took the occasion to dissolve the National Council parliament. After the socialist February Uprising of 1934, he had eight insurgents immediately executed, earning him the reputation of an &quot;assassin of the workers&quot;. The executions have since been referred to as a vengeful act of judicial murder. Schuschnigg himself later called his orders a &quot;faux pas&quot;.

On 1 May 1934, Dollfuss had erected the authoritarian Federal State of Austria. After Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazi Otto Planetta during the July Putsch, Schuschnigg on 29 July was appointed Austrian chancellor. Like Dollfuss, Schuschnigg ruled mostly by decree. Although his rule was milder than that of Dollfuss, his Austrofascist policies were not much different from the policies of his predecessor. He had to manage the economy of a near-bankrupt state and to maintain law and order in a country which was forbidden, by the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, to maintain an army in excess of 30,000 men. At the same time, he had to also cope with armed paramilitary forces in Austria, which owed their allegiance not to the state but to various rival political parties. He also had to be mindful of the growing strength of the Austrian Nazis, who supported Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ambitions to absorb Austria into Nazi Germany. His overriding political concern was to preserve Austria&#x27;s independence within the borders imposed on it by the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which ultimately failed.

John Gunther wrote in 1936 of Schuschnigg: &quot;It would not be too much to say that he is as much a prisoner of the Italians now [as he was during World War I]—if the Germans don&#x27;t get him next week.&quot; His policy of counterbalancing the German threat by aligning himself with Austria&#x27;s southern and eastern neighbours—the Kingdom of Italy under the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini and the Kingdom of Hungary—was doomed to failure after Mussolini had sought Hitler&#x27;s support in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and left Austria under the increasing pressure of a massively rearmed Third Reich. Schuschnigg adopted a policy of appeasement towards Hitler and called Austria the &quot;better German state&quot;, but struggled to keep Austria independent. In July 1936, he signed an Austro-German Agreement, which, among other concessions, allowed the release of imprisoned July Putsch insurgents and the inclusion of the Nazi contact men Edmund Glaise-Horstenau and Guido Schmidt in the Austrian cabinet. The Nazi Party remained banned; however, the Austrian Nazis gained ground and relations between the two countries deteriorated further. In reaction to Hitler&#x27;s threats to exercise a controlling influence over Austrian politics, Schuschnigg publicly declared in January 1938:

There is no question of ever accepting Nazi representatives in the Austrian cabinet. An absolute abyss separates Austria from Nazism ... We reject uniformity and centralization. ... Catholicism is anchored in our very soil, and we know but one God: and that is not the State, or the Nation, or that elusive thing, Race.Rumours concerning his involvement in the Von Trapp family’s rise to fame have also come to light. It’s rumoured that upon hearing the Von Trapp family sing over the radio, he invited them to perform in Vienna which greatly helped them in their rise to fame.

===&quot;Anschluss&quot;===

On 12 February 1938, Schuschnigg met with Hitler in his Berghof residence in an attempt to smooth the worsening relations between their two countries. To Schuschnigg&#x27;s surprise, Hitler presented him with a set of demands which, in manner and in terms, amounted to an ultimatum, effectively demanding the handing over of power to the Austrian Nazis. The terms of the agreement, presented to Schuschnigg for immediate endorsement, stipulated the appointment of Nazi sympathiser Arthur Seyss-Inquart as minister of security, which controlled the police. Another pro-Nazi, Dr. Hans Fischböck, was to be named as minister of finance to prepare for economic union between Germany and Austria. A hundred officers were to be exchanged between the Austrian and the German armies. All imprisoned Nazis were to be amnestied and reinstated. In return, Hitler would publicly reaffirm the treaty of 11 July 1936 and Austria&#x27;s national sovereignty. &quot;The Fuhrer was abusive and threatening, and Schuschnigg was presented with far-reaching demands ...&quot; According to Schuschnigg&#x27;s memoirs, he was coerced into signing the &quot;agreement&quot; before leaving Berchtesgaden.

The president, Wilhelm Miklas, was reluctant to endorse the agreement but eventually did so. Then he, Schuschnigg and a few key Cabinet members considered a number of options:

:1. The Chancellor resign and the President call on a new Chancellor to form a Cabinet, which would be under no obligation to the commitments of Berchtesgaden.
:2. The Berchtesgaden agreement be carried out under a newly appointed Chancellor.
:3. The agreement be carried out and the Chancellor remain at his post.

In the event, they decided to go with the third option.

On the following day, 14 February, Schuschnigg reorganised his cabinet on a broader basis and included representatives of all former and present political parties. Hitler immediately appointed a new Gauleiter for Austria, a Nazi Austrian army officer who had just been released from prison in accordance with the terms of the general amnesty stipulated by the Berchtesgaden agreement.

On 20 February, Hitler made a speech before the Reichstag which was broadcast live and which for the first time was relayed also by the Austrian radio network. A key phrase in the speech was: &quot;The German Reich is no longer willing to tolerate the suppression of ten million Germans across its borders.&quot;

In Austria, the speech was met with concern and by demonstrations by both pro and anti-Nazi elements. On the evening of 24 February, the Austrian Federal Diet (the Austrian Bundestag), was called into session. In his speech to the Diet, Schuschnigg referred to the July 1936 agreement with Germany and stated: &quot;Austria will go thus far and no further.&quot; He ended his speech with an emotional appeal to Austrian patriotism: &quot;Red-White-Red (the colours of the Austrian flag) until we&#x27;re dead!&quot; The speech was received with disapproval from the Austrian Nazis and they began mobilising their supporters. The headline in &quot;The Times&quot; of London was &quot;Schuschnigg&#x27;s Speech – Nazis Disturbed&quot;. The phrase &quot;thus far and no further&quot; was found &quot;disturbing&quot; by the German press.

To resolve the political uncertainty in the country and to convince Hitler and the rest of the world that the people of Austria wished to remain Austrian and independent of the Third Reich, Schuschnigg, with the full agreement of the President and other political leaders, decided to proclaim a plebiscite to be held on 13 March. But the wording of the referendum which had to be responded to with a &quot;Yes&quot; or a &quot;No&quot; turned out to be controversial. It read: &quot;Are you for a free, German, independent and social, Christian and united Austria, for peace and work, for the equality of all those who affirm themselves for the people and Fatherland?&quot;

There was another issue which drew the ire of the National Socialists. Although members of Schuschnigg&#x27;s party (the Fatherland Front) could vote at any age, all other Austrians below the age of 24 were to be excluded under a clause to that effect in the Austrian Constitution. This would shut out from the polls most of the Nazi sympathisers in Austria, since the movement was strongest among the young.

Knowing he was in a bind, Schuschnigg held talks with the leaders of the Social Democrats, and agreed to legalise their party and their trade unions in return for their support of the referendum.

The German reaction to the announcement was swift. Hitler first insisted the plebiscite be cancelled. When Schuschnigg reluctantly agreed to scrap it, Hitler demanded his resignation, and insisted that Seyss-Inquart be appointed his successor. This demand President Miklas was reluctant to endorse but eventually, under the threat of immediate armed intervention, it was endorsed as well. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed Chancellor, but it made no difference; German troops flooded into Austria and were received everywhere by enthusiastic and jubilant crowds. On the morning after the invasion, the London &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s correspondent asked the new Chancellor, Seyss-Inquart, how these stirring events came about, he received the following reply: &quot;The Plebiscite that had been fixed for tomorrow was a breach of the agreement which Dr. Schuschnigg made with Hitler at Berchtesgaden, by which he promised political liberty for National Socialists in Austria.&quot; 
On 12 March 1938, Schuschnigg was placed under house arrest.

=== Prison and concentration camp ===
After initial house arrest followed by solitary confinement at Gestapo headquarters, he spent the whole of World War II in Sachsenhausen, then Dachau. In late April 1945, Schuschnigg narrowly escaped an execution order by Adolf Hitler, along with other prominent concentration camp inmates, by being transferred from Dachau to South Tyrol where SS-Totenkopfverbände guards abandoned the prisoners into the hands of some Wehrmacht officers, who then freed them. They were then turned over to American troops on 4 May 1945. From there, Schuschnigg and his family were transported, along with many of the ex-prisoners, to the isle of Capri in Italy before being set free.

===Later life===
After World War II, Kurt Schuschnigg was forbidden from joining the ÖVP because the party wanted to distance itself from the Austrian dictatorship. Moreover, the ÖVP did not expect their social democratic coalition partner to tolerate Schuschnigg&#x27;s presence in the party, since after the civil war of 1934 he had had many social democrats killed as Minister of Justice. Schuschnigg emigrated to the United States, where he was sheltered at the chateau estate Vouziers of the Desloge family in St. Louis, Missouri; and then he became a professor of political science at Saint Louis University from 1948 to 1967. He became an American citizen in 1956.

His first wife Herma died in a car accident in 1935. He remarried in 1938, but lost his second wife, Vera Fugger von Babenhausen (née Countess Czernin), in 1959.

Kurt Schuschnigg went back to Austria where he downplayed his time exercising dictatorial powers as chancellor and tried to justify Austrofascism.

Schuschnigg died at Mutters, near Innsbruck, in 1977.

<text>Charles Ammi Cutter (March 14, 1837 – September 6, 1903) was an American librarian. In the 1850s and 1860s he assisted with the re-cataloging of the Harvard College library, producing America&#x27;s first public card catalog. The card system proved more flexible for librarians and far more useful to patrons than the old method of entering titles in chronological order in large books. In 1868 he joined the Boston Athenaeum, making its card catalog an international model. Cutter promoted centralized cataloging of books, which became the standard practice at the Library of Congress. He was elected to leadership positions in numerous library organizations at the local and national level. Cutter is remembered for the Cutter Expansive Classification, his system of giving standardized classification numbers to each book, and arranging them on shelves by that number so that books on similar topics would be shelved together.

== Biography ==
Cutter was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His aunt was an employee of the regional library in Boston. In 1856 Cutter was enrolled into Harvard Divinity School. He was appointed assistant librarian of the divinity school while still a student there and served in that capacity from 1857 to 1859. During that time, Cutter began designing a distinct cataloging schema for the library&#x27;s outdated system. The catalog, dating from 1840, had a lack of order after the acquisition of 4,000 volumes from the collection of Professor Gottfried Christian Friedrich Lücke of the University of Göttingen, which added much depth to the Divinity School Library&#x27;s collection.

During the 1857–1858 school year, Cutter rearranged the library collection on the shelves into broad subject categories along with classmate Charles Noyes Forbes. During the winter break of 1858–1859, they arranged the collection into a single listing alphabetically by author. This project was finished by the time Cutter graduated in 1859. By 1860 Cutter was already a seasoned staff member of the library and a full-time librarian. He became a journeyman to the chief cataloger and assistant librarian to Ezra Abbot. At Harvard College Cutter developed a new form of index catalog, using cards instead of published volumes, containing both an author index and a &quot;classed catalog&quot; or a rudimentary form of subject index.

In 1868 the Boston Athenæum library elected Cutter as its head librarian. His first assignment was to organize and aggregate the inventory of the library and develop a catalog from that and to publish a complete dictionary catalog for their collection. The previous librarian and assistants had been working on this, but much of the work was sub par and, according to Cutter, needed to be redone. This did not sit well with the trustees who wanted to get a catalog published as soon as possible. However, the catalog was revised and published in five volumes and is known as the Athenæum Catalogue. Cutter was the librarian at the Boston Athenaeum for twenty-five years (1869-1892).

In 1876, Cutter was hired by the United States Bureau of Education to help write a report about the state of libraries for the Centennial. Part two of this report was his Rules for a Printed Dictionary Catalogue (1876). This catalog was included in the organization&#x27;s publication &quot;Public Libraries in the United States of America: Their History, Condition, and Management&quot;. Cutter implemented many ideologies familiar to contemporary librarians during his time at the Athenaeum. Cutter introduced characteristic structures and philosophies such as inter-library loan and furnishing every book with a pouch in the rear to encase a card in order to keep track of the item&#x27;s circulating status.

Cutter served as editor of the &quot;Library Journal&quot; from 1891 to 1893. Of the many articles he wrote during this time, one of the most famous was an article called &quot;&quot;. In it, he wrote what he thought a library would be like one hundred years in the future. He spent a lot of time discussing practicalities, such as how the library arranged adequate lighting and controlled moisture in the air to preserve the books.

In 1880 Cutter introduced an avant-garde and divergent system of cataloging he termed the Cutter Expansive Classification. This system incorporated seven levels of classification with the most basic libraries operating at the first level and the grandest, most distinguished institutions utilizing the seventh level, and it was Cutter&#x27;s aspiration to orchestrate a classification system for every type of library. The classification system, or scheme, utilized an alpha-numeric methodology used to abbreviate authors&#x27; names and generate unique call numbers known as &quot;Cutter numbers&quot; or &quot;Cutter codes&quot;. This scheme, on which the current Library of Congress cataloging system is partially based, in turn laid the foundation for the Library of Congress Subject Headings and the Sears List of Subject Headings. When Cutter began to delegate a new system for the library he initially chose the Dewey Decimal Classification, however he determined it was more beneficial to assign a more distinct adaptation for the collection. Even though Cutter&#x27;s Expansive Classification was recognized as a significant contribution to libraries and to the burgeoning field of library science, Cutter himself did not champion its success nor did he anticipate future editions of his system. Nevertheless, his &quot;Cutter numbers&quot; survived and are still used in libraries today.

Cutter did not find the Dewey system practical for his cataloging purposes, and indeed, Dewey and he often experienced tensions with one another while constituting the American Library Association. of which they were two of the 100 founding members in 1876. Nevertheless, he was regarded as an accomplished and sophisticated librarian and cataloger. Cutter was commissioned on at least one occasion to propose an architectural conception for the University of Toronto Library which had recently been consumed by a massive conflagration. In response to the library&#x27;s requests, Cutter admonished, &quot;It is of little use to have a fire proof stack if the rest of the building gets afire&quot;. The ever austere Cutter with his competence in cataloging expressed this, &quot;The catalogers ought to be put near the catalog; they have continual reason to refer to it&quot;. Cutter then continued his cataloging tirade by rebuking their present approach and stating, &quot;Catalog work cannot be carried on economically unless there is plenty of shelf room near for bibliographic authorities and some empty shelves in the room to hold books waiting to be cataloged&quot;.

In 1893, Cutter submitted a letter to the trustees that he would not seek to renew his contract at the end of the year. However, there was an opportunity for him in Northampton, Massachusetts. Judge Charles E. Forbes left a considerable amount of money to the town to start a library. This was Cutter&#x27;s chance to institute his ideas from the ground up. He developed a cataloging system called the expansive classification system. It was to have seven levels of classification, each with increasing specificity. Thus small libraries who did not like having to deal with unnecessarily long classification numbers could use lower levels and still be specific enough for their purpose. Larger libraries could use the more specific tables since they needed to be more specific to keep subjects separate. He died in 1903 before he could finish this task. At Forbes, Cutter set up the art and music department and encouraged children of nearby schools to exhibit their art. He also established branch libraries and instituted a traveling library system much like the bookmobile. Today, Charles Ammi Cutter might be surprised to see his own portrait hanging over the reference librarians&#x27; desk in the Forbes Library in Northampton. His roll top desk is also in the office currently occupied by the recently elected director of the library.

Cutter died on September 6, 1903, in Walpole, New Hampshire.

<doc id="531725" wikidata="Q1384384" url="?curid=531725" title="Experimental Breeder Reactor I">
<text>Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) is a decommissioned research reactor and U.S. National Historic Landmark located in the desert about southeast of Arco, Idaho. It was the world&#x27;s first breeder reactor. At 1:50 p.m. on December 20, 1951, it became one of the world&#x27;s first electricity-generating nuclear power plants when it produced sufficient electricity to illuminate four 200-watt light bulbs. EBR-I soon generated sufficient electricity to power its building, and the town of Arco and continued to be used for experimental research until it was decommissioned in 1964. The museum is open for visitors from late May until early September.

==History==
EBR-I&#x27;s construction started in late 1949. The reactor was designed and built by a team led by Walter Zinn at the Idaho site of the Argonne National Laboratory, known as Argonne-West (since 2005 part of Idaho National Laboratory). In its early stages, the reactor plant was referred to as Chicago Pile 4 (CP-4) and Zinn&#x27;s Infernal Pile . Installation of the reactor at EBR-I took place in early 1951 (the first reactor in Idaho) and it began power operation on August 24, 1951. On December 20 of that year, EBR-I produced electricity for its first time. The following day, the reactor produced enough power to light the whole building. The EBR-I produced 200 kW of electricity out of 1.4 MW of heat generated by the reactor.

The production of electricity at EBR-I is the first time that a reactor created in-house available electricity, and it is sometimes misreferred to as the first time that a nuclear reactor has ever created electricity, or powered a light bulb. However, the world&#x27;s first electricity produced by a nuclear reactor occurred during an experiment 3 years earlier in September 1948 at the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. A small steam turbine allowed that reactor to power a single light bulb. Later in 1955, another nuclear milestone was reached when an experimental boiling water reactor plant called (also designed, built, and operated by Argonne National Laboratory) was connected to external loads, powering the nearby city of Arco, Idaho, the first time a city had been powered solely by nuclear power. 
The design purpose of EBR-I was not to produce electricity but instead to validate nuclear physics theory that suggested that a breeder reactor should be possible. The concept suggested using a reactor&#x27;s neutron radiation to convert or &quot;breed&quot; a blanket of fertile material into new fissile material. The reaction used in EBR-I&#x27;s design was the breeding of uranium-238 into plutonium via fast neutrons:

&lt;chem&gt;{}^{238}_{92}U + {}^{1}_{0}n -&gt; {}^{239}_{92}U -&gt;[\beta^-][23.5\ \ce{min}] {}^{239}_{93}Np -&gt;[\beta^-][2.356\ \ce{d}] {}^{239}_{94}Pu&lt;/chem&gt;

This reaction had already been used in the X-10 Graphite Reactor and Hanford Site B, D, F, and DR reactors to produce plutonium for the Gadget, Fat Man, and further pits. However, the Hanford reactors would only yield about 0.025% of fissile 239Pu, from the fissile 235U content of 0.7% in the natural uranium fuel slugs. This corresponds to a &quot;conversion ratio&quot; of 1/30. The EBR-I design aimed to increase this by limiting neutron loss and maintaining a fast spectrum, achieving a ratio above one. In EBR-I, the ratio was experimentally calculated as:

formula_1

In 1956, an AEC report concluded a radiochemically measured conversion ratio of 1.00 ± 0.04, and a physically measured ratio of 1.01 ± 0.05, tentatively making it the world&#x27;s first breeder reactor.

On November 29, 1955, the reactor at EBR-I suffered a partial meltdown during a coolant flow test. The flow test was trying to determine the cause of unexpected reactor responses to changes in coolant flow. It was subsequently repaired for further experiments, which determined that thermal expansion of the fuel rods and the thick plates supporting the fuel rods was the cause of the unexpected reactor response.

Besides being one of the world&#x27;s first to generate plant electricity from atomic energy, EBR-I was also the world&#x27;s first breeder reactor and the first to use plutonium fuel to generate electricity (see also the Clementine nuclear reactor). EBR-I&#x27;s initial purpose was to prove Enrico Fermi&#x27;s fuel breeding principle, a principle that a nuclear reactor can produce more fuel atoms than it consumes. EBR-I proved this principle.

===Design===

As a breeder reactor, EBR-I used a &quot;seed-and-blanket design&quot;. The core &quot;seed&quot; was highly enriched uranium at 90% uranium-235. The inner blanket contained rods of natural uranium at 0.7% uranium-235 content. This structure was surrounded by the double-walled tank containing the NaK primary coolant. This tank was surrounded by the air-cooled outer blanket of natural uranium, used for its effective neutron reflecting properties, and which also contained the control rods. The outer blanket was the movable component, as technique for moving parts within liquid metal were in early stages. However the air-cooling greatly limited the maximum operating power, which was reached at 1.4 MWth.

The primary liquid metal coolant flows by gravity from the supply tank through the reactor core, where it absorbs heat. Then, the coolant flows to heat the exchanger, where it gives up this heat to the secondary coolant, another liquid metal. The primary coolant is returned to the supply tank by an electromagnetic pump. The secondary coolant is pumped to the boiler, where it gives up its heat to water, generating steam. This steam passes to the turbine, which is how electricity is produced. This steam then condenses and returned to the boiler by a water pump. This coolant design was shared by the later Dounreay Fast Reactor which first went critical in 1959.

===Decommission and legacy===
EBR-I was deactivated by Argonne in 1964 and replaced with a new reactor, Experimental Breeder Reactor II.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 with its dedication ceremony held on August 25, 1966, led by President Lyndon Johnson and Glenn T. Seaborg. It was also declared an IEEE Milestone in 2004.

<doc id="531730" wikidata="Q543844" url="?curid=531730" title="The Case of Charles Dexter Ward">
<text>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is a short horror novel (51,500 words) by American writer H. P. Lovecraft, written in early 1927, but not published during the author&#x27;s lifetime. Set in Lovecraft&#x27;s hometown of Providence, Rhode Island, it was first published (in abridged form) in the May and July issues of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1941; the first complete publication was in Arkham House&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot; collection (1943). It is included in the Library of America volume of Lovecraft&#x27;s work.

The novel, set in 1928, describes how Charles Dexter Ward becomes obsessed with his distant ancestor, Joseph Curwen, an alleged wizard with unsavory habits. Ward physically resembles Curwen, and attempts to duplicate his ancestor&#x27;s Qabalistic and alchemical feats. He eventually uses this knowledge to physically resurrect Curwen. Ward&#x27;s doctor, Marinus Bicknell Willett, investigates Ward&#x27;s activities and is horrified by what he finds.

==Plot summary==
Charles Dexter Ward is a young man from a prominent Rhode Island family who has disappeared from a mental asylum. He had been incarcerated during a prolonged period of insanity, during which he exhibited minor and inexplicable physiological changes. His empty cell is found to be very dusty. The bulk of the story concerns the investigation conducted by the Wards&#x27; family doctor, Marinus Bicknell Willett, in an attempt to discover the reason for Ward&#x27;s madness and physiological changes. Willett learns that Ward had spent the past several years attempting to discover the grave of his ill-reputed ancestor, Joseph Curwen.

The doctor slowly begins to reveal the truth behind the legends surrounding Curwen, an eighteenth-century shipping entrepreneur and alleged alchemist, who was in reality a necromancer and mass murderer. A raid on Curwen&#x27;s farm was remarkable for the shouted incantations, lights, explosions, and some not-quite-human figures shot down by the raiders. The raiders swore any witnesses to strict secrecy about what they saw and heard.

As Willett&#x27;s investigations proceed, he finds that Charles had recovered Curwen&#x27;s ashes, and through the use of magical formulae contained in documents found hidden in Curwen&#x27;s home in Providence was able to call forth Curwen from his &quot;essential saltes&quot; and resurrect him. Willett also finds that Curwen, who resembles Charles enough to pass for him, murdered and replaced his modern descendant and resumed his evil activities. Although Curwen convinces onlookers that he is Charles, his anachronistic mindset and behavior lead authorities to certify him insane and imprison him in an asylum.

While Curwen is locked up, Willett&#x27;s investigation leads him to a bungalow in Pawtuxet Village, which Ward had purchased while under the influence of Curwen. The house is on the site of the old farm which was Curwen&#x27;s headquarters for his nefarious doings; beneath is a vast catacomb that the wizard had built as a lair during his previous lifetime. During a horrific journey through this labyrinth, in which Willett sees a deformed monster in a pit, he discovers the truth about Curwen&#x27;s crimes and also the means of returning him to the grave. It is also revealed that Curwen has been engaged in a long-term conspiracy with certain other necromancers, associates from his previous life who have somehow escaped death, to resurrect and torture the world&#x27;s wisest people to gain knowledge that will make them powerful and threaten the future of mankind. 

While in Curwen&#x27;s laboratory, Willett accidentally summons an ancient entity who is an enemy of Curwen and his fellow necromancers. The doctor faints, awakening much later in the bungalow. The entrance to the vaults has been sealed as if it had never existed, but Willett finds a note from the being written in Latin instructing him to kill Curwen and destroy his body. Willett confronts Curwen at the asylum and succeeds in reversing the resurrection spell, returning the sorcerer to dust. News reports reveal that Curwen&#x27;s prime co-conspirators and their households have met brutal deaths, and their lairs have been destroyed.

==Characters==
===Charles Dexter Ward===
Ward is born in 1902; he is 26 in 1928, at the time the story takes place. Though considered one of Lovecraft&#x27;s autobiographical characters, some details of the character seem to be based on William Lippitt Mauran, who lived in the Halsey house and, like Ward, was &quot;wheeled...in a carriage&quot; in front of it. Like the Wards, the Maurans also owned a farmhouse in Pawtuxet, Rhode Island.

===Joseph Curwen===
Ward&#x27;s ancestor (great-great-great-grandfather) and dead ringer, a successful merchant, shipping magnate, slave trader, and highly accomplished sorcerer, born in what is now Danvers, Massachusetts, seven miles from Salem, on February 18, 1662. He flees to Providence from the Salem witch trials in 1692. He dies, at least temporarily, in 1771 in the course of a raid on his lair by a group of important Providence citizens (Abraham Whipple, John and Moses Brown and Esek Hopkins among them) who have got wind of only a few of his crimes. He is killed again, presumably for good, by Dr Willett using Curwen&#x27;s own sorcery. Curwen perfects a method of reducing the effects of aging to an uncanny degree. He also has the ability to resurrect the dead from either the complete corpse or its &quot;essential saltes&quot; (derived from the ashes of said corpse), and converse with them. This ability is used to obtain privileged intelligence from long-defunct wise men. To this end his agents scour the graveyards and tombs of the world for the corpses of illustrious persons which are then smuggled back to Providence, where Curwen temporarily raises them to torture their secrets out of them. In this endeavour he is assisted by two fellow necromancers and Salem exiles; Jedediah/Simon Orne, alias Joseph Nadek, who lives in Prague, and Edward Hutchinson, who masquerades as Baron Ferenczy in Transylvania. 

He is able to summon entities such as Yog-Sothoth to assist him in his magic. The ultimate goal of these men&#x27;s activities, i.e. the nature or the use for the information extracted from the resurrected wise persons, is not completely specified and its interpretation is largely left to the reader. This ambiguity also affects, notably, the exact circumstances of Curwen&#x27;s &quot;first&quot; death. It is evident he was betrayed and probably killed by the entity summoned in his defense during the siege to the hidden grounds of his farm, but the identity of this being, as well as its possible connection with Yog-Sothoth (whose name is mentioned in the incantations) is left open to speculation. It is significant, however, that the entity&#x27;s irruption during the confrontation elicits &quot;An unmistakable human shout or deep chorused scream&quot;, as well as &quot;a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness [that] wrenched from scores of human throats—a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst&quot;, and that the participants of the raid are left with psychological sequels far beyond those expected in any episode of unconventional warfare. 

Prior to his first death, Curwen finds a way to create a spell that would transcend time and inspire a descendant to become interested in him and his work and attempt to bring him back should he ever be slain. When later resurrected by Ward, Curwen initially goes in disguise as a bearded, spectacled &quot;Dr. Allen&quot; to avoid suspicion due to his close resemblance to Ward. The undead Curwen showed vampiristic tendencies as a side effect of his resurrection, thereby attacking local travelers and breaking into houses to drink the blood of the inhabitants. Curwen immediately made contact with Orne and Hutchinson, who have been alive and active all the while, and starts up his old plots once again. He soon murders Ward when he starts having doubts about what they are doing and assumes his identity. Curwen never hesitates to stoop to murder, torture or blackmail to achieve his ends; he also uses – and kills – vast numbers of living slaves as subjects for his experiments. He also feigns some degree of civic spirit and decency, both to his fellow citizens and to his wife, as part of a clever ruse—a social gambit aimed at producing an heir, as well as improving his public image to avoid forced displacement.

===Marinus Bicknell Willett===
&quot;An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; compares Willett&#x27;s character to other &quot;valiant counterweight[s]&quot; in Lovecraft such as Thomas Malone in &quot;The Horror at Red Hook&quot; (1925) and Henry Armitage in &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;; like Willett, Armitage &quot;defeats the &#x27;villains&#x27; by incantations, and he is susceptible to the same flaws—pomposity, arrogance, self-importance—that can be seen in Willett.&quot;

==Inspiration==
In August 1925, Lovecraft&#x27;s Aunt Lillian sent him an anecdote about the house at 140 Prospect Street, built in 1801 by Colonel Thomas Lloyd Halsey in Providence, Rhode Island. Lovecraft wrote back, &quot;So the Halsey house is haunted! Ugh! That&#x27;s where Wild Tom Halsey kept live terrapins in the cellar—maybe it&#x27;s their ghosts. Anyway, it&#x27;s a magnificent old mansion, &amp; a credit to a magnificent old town!&quot; Lovecraft would make this house—renumbered as 100 Prospect—the basis for the Ward house. The following month, September 1925, Lovecraft read &quot;Providence in Colonial Times&quot;, by Gertrude Selwyn Kimball, a 1912 history that provided him the anecdotes about John Merritt and Dr. Checkley that he incorporated into his novel.

A possible literary model is Walter de la Mare&#x27;s novel &quot;The Return&quot; (1910), which Lovecraft read in mid-1926. He describes it in his essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; as a tale in which &quot;We see the soul of a dead man reach out of its grave of two centuries and fasten itself on the flesh of the living.&quot;

The theme of a descendant who closely resembles a distant ancestor may come from Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;, which Lovecraft called &quot;New England&#x27;s greatest contribution to weird literature&quot; in &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;.

Another proposed literary source is M. R. James&#x27; short story &quot;Count Magnus&quot;, also praised in &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;, which suggests the resurrection of a sinister 17th century figure.

The germ of inspiration came from Lovecraft reading Cotton Mather and running across a quote from Borellus. Borellus is Petrus Borellus, also known as Pierre Borel, a well-known French doctor and alchemist. The quote refers to old experiments of the alchemists in creating life/rebirth from death using essential salts. The entire quote (which is actually a paraphrasing by Mather) is as follows:

==Reception==

Lovecraft himself was displeased with the novel, calling it a &quot;cumbrous, creaking bit of self-conscious antiquarianism&quot;. He made little effort to publish the work, leaving it to be published posthumously in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; by August Derleth and Donald Wandrei.

Writing in the &quot;New York Times,&quot; reviewer William Poster described &quot;Ward&quot; as &quot;a good story in the New England witchcraft tradition, well seasoned with alchemy, vampirism, ancient documents and mummy-stealing&quot;. Horror historian Les Daniels called &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;finest novel&quot;. E. F. Bleiler noted that the short novel, &quot;despite its being strangely tired and routine, has interesting concepts and good moments&quot;. Baird Searles found that &quot;HPL&#x27;s great knowledge of New England history provides a convincing background&quot; for the story. Douglas Robillard stated Lovecraft&#x27;s negative assessment of &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; was &quot;too harsh; this is one of his finest works&quot;.

==Cthulhu Mythos==
&quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; contains the first mention of the Cthulhu Mythos entity Yog-Sothoth, who appears repeatedly as an element in an incantation. Joseph Curwen is the owner of a copy of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; and there are hints of cult activities in a fishing village that refer obliquely to the events narrated in &quot;The Festival&quot;. The story also contains references to the Dream Cycle: Dr. Willett notices the &quot;Sign of Koth&quot; chiselled above a doorway, and remembers his friend Randolph Carter drawing the sign and explaining its powers and meaning.

Brian Lumley expanded on the character of Baron Ferenczy, mentioned but never met in &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot;, in his &quot;Necroscope&quot; series, specifically &quot;Book IV: Deadspeak&quot;, where Janos Ferenczy uses the Yog-Sothoth formula to call forth whole bodies from ash remains, and to return them to that state.

When Dexter&#x27;s mother hears chanting (&quot;per adonai eloim, adonai jehova, adonai sabaoth, metraton on agla mathon, verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae, conventus, antra gnomorum, daemonia coeli gad, almousin, gibor, jehosua, evam, zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.&quot;), the chanting is quoted (along with many other incantations in the story) from Eliphas Levi&#x27;s &quot;Transcendental Magic&quot;, which translates the passage as &quot;By Adonaï Eloïm, Adonaï Jehova, Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Adonaï Mathon, the pythonic word, the mystery of the salamander, the assembly of sylphs, the grotto of gnomes, the demons of the heaven of Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua, Evam, Zariatnatmik, Come, Come, Come!&quot; The incantation invokes several divine names, such as Adonai, Eloim, and Jehova, and references the Salamander, Sylphs, and Gnomes, which are the alchemical representatives of Fire, Air, and Earth respectively, as described by Paracelsus. The &quot;mystery of the salamander&quot; is also referenced in other short stories.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
* In 1963, Roger Corman filmed a loose adaptation of the story titled &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; starring Vincent Price and Lon Chaney Jr. The film was advertised as &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;,&quot; but it was not based on Poe&#x27;s poem of the same title.
* In 1992, Dan O&#x27;Bannon filmed a more faithful adaptation, &quot;The Resurrected&quot;, starring John Terry and Chris Sarandon.

===Games===
* In 2001, DreamCatcher Interactive published a video game titled &quot;&quot; developed by Wanadoo Edition. All the characters&#x27; names from the book were changed, as was the ending.
* Specialbit Studio produced a hidden object game titled &quot;Haunted Hotel: Charles Dexter Ward&quot;. It follows the broad strokes of the story, with the player controlling Charles Ward&#x27;s sister, who attempts to investigate his pending transformation into Joseph Curwen.

===Stage===
* In 1980 Ken Campbell&#x27;s Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool staged an opera based on the novel, with music by Camilla Saunders.

===Audio and music===
* In 2013, The H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society produced a Dark Adventure Radio Theatre radio drama interpretation.
* In 2017, the Mechanisms released &quot;The Bifrost Incident&quot;, a concept album mixing elements of Lovecraft&#x27;s work with Norse mythology. Yog-Sothoth appears at the climax, after the full incantation from &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; is recited.
* In December 2018, BBC Radio broadcast an adaptation of the story as the first series in &quot;The Lovecraft Investigations,&quot; a modern-day true crime podcast set in Britain and the US. It was released in 10 episodes, and later aired on BBC Radio 4 as regular radio-broadcast episodes. The story was adapted and directed by Julian Simpson, and the cast included Samuel Barnett as Ward, with Barnaby Kay and Jana Carpenter as true crime podcasters investigating his story. The supporting cast included Alun Armstrong, Adam Godley, Nicola Walker, Steven Mackintosh, Mark Bazeley, Richard Cordery, Harry Kay, Penny Downie, Madeleine Potter, Phoebe Fox, Ben Crowe, Nathan Osgood, Susan Jameson, Samantha Dakin, Alex Lanipekun and Cherrelle Skeete. In 2019, a sequel was made adapting &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; followed in 2020 by an adaption of &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;.

=== Comics ===
The novel was adapted by artist I.N.J. Culbard in 2012, in a comic book published by Self Made Hero under the novel&#x27;s title, featuring a foreword by comic book creator Jeff Lemire. The art in this rendition was described by one critic as &quot;a brilliant job of communicating [a] vision of a rotting afterlife to... readers.&quot;

<text>The Department of Computer Science and Technology, formerly the Computer Laboratory, is the computer science department of the University of Cambridge. it employed 56 faculty members, 45 support staff, 105 research staff, and about 205 research students. The current Head of Department is Professor Alastair Beresford.

== History ==
The department was founded as the Mathematical Laboratory under the leadership of John Lennard-Jones on 14 May 1937, though it did not get properly established until after World War II. The new laboratory was housed in the North Wing of the former Anatomy School, on the New Museums Site. Upon its foundation, it was intended &quot;to provide a computing service for general use, and to be a centre for the development of computational techniques in the University&quot;. The Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science was the world&#x27;s first postgraduate taught course in computing, starting in 1953.

In October 1946, work began under Maurice Wilkes on EDSAC (&quot;Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator&quot;), which subsequently became the world&#x27;s first fully operational and practical stored program computer when it ran its first program on 6 May 1949. It inspired the world&#x27;s first business computer, LEO. It was replaced by EDSAC 2, the first microcoded and bit-sliced computer, in 1958.

In 1961, David Hartley developed Autocode, one of the first high-level programming languages, for EDSAC 2. Also in that year, proposals for Titan, based on the Ferranti Atlas machine, were developed. Titan became fully operational in 1964 and EDSAC 2 was retired the following year. In 1967, a full (&#x27;24/7&#x27;) multi-user time-shared service for up to 64 users was inaugurated on Titan.

In 1970, the Mathematical Laboratory was renamed the Computer Laboratory, with separate departments for Teaching and Research and the Computing Service, providing computing services to the university and its colleges. The two did not fully separate until 2001, when the Computer Laboratory moved out to the new William Gates building in West Cambridge, off Madingley Road, leaving behind an independent Computing Service.

In 2002, the Computer Laboratory launched the Cambridge Computer Lab Ring, a graduate society named after the Cambridge Ring network.

== Current ==

On 30 June 2017, the Cambridge University Reporter announced that the Computer Laboratory would change its name to the Department of Computer Science and Technology from 1 October 2017, to reflect the broadened scope of its purpose and activities.

The department currently offers a 3-year undergraduate course and a 1-year masters course (with a large selection of specialised courses in various research areas). Recent research has focused on virtualisation, security, usability, formal verification, formal semantics of programming languages, computer architecture, natural language processing, mobile computing, wireless networking, biometric identification, robotics, routing, positioning systems and sustainability (&quot;Computing for the future of the planet&quot;). Members have been involved in the creation of many successful UK IT companies such as Acorn, ARM, and XenSource.

== Achievements and innovations ==
Members have made impact in computers, Turing machines,
microprogramming, subroutines, computer networks, mobile protocols, security, 
programming languages, kernels, OS, security, virtualisation, location badge
systems, etc. Below is a list.
* EDSAC – world&#x27;s first practical stored program electronic computer (1949–1958)
* Subroutine (1951)
* OXO – world&#x27;s first video game (1952)
* EDSAC 2 (1958–1965)
* Autocode – one of the first high-level programming languages (1961)
* Titan – early multi-user time-share computer (1964–1973)
* Phoenix – IBM 370 with locally developed OS and hardware extensions (1973–1995)
* TRIPOS operating system – became later the basis for AmigaDOS
* BCPL programming language – ancestor of C
* CAP computer – hardware support for capability-based security
* Cambridge Ring – an early local area network
* Cambridge Distributed Computing System
* Trojan Room coffee pot – the world&#x27;s first webcam (1993)
* Iris recognition – biometric identification with vanishingly small false-accept rate
* Nemesis – real-time microkernel OS
* Active Badge System –
* Active Bat – ultrasonic indoor positioning system
* Xen – virtual machine monitor (2003–&quot;present&quot;)
* Isabelle and HOL – interactive theorem provers
* CAD - Alan Grayer, Charles Lang and Ian Braid were researchers who left the department to found Shape Data, develop the Romulus CAD kernel and later the ACIS kernel that forms the basis of several modern CAD systems. Shape Data went on to develop Parasolid, which is used in many modern CAD systems. 
== Impact on business enterprise ==

A number of companies have been founded by staff and graduates. Their names were featured in the new entrance in 2012. Some cited examples of successful companies are ARM, Autonomy, Aveva, CSR and Domino. One common factor they share is that key staff or founder members are &quot;drenched in university training and research&quot;. The Cambridge Computer Lab Ring was praised for its &quot;tireless work&quot; by Andy Hopper in 2012, at its tenth anniversary dinner.

== Notable alumni (industries) ==

* Demis Hassabis 
* Eben Upton 
* Bjarne Stroustrup 
* John Bates 
* Ian Pratt 
* David L Tennenhouse
* Michael Burrows 
* Andrew Herbert 
* Andy Harter
* Andy Hopper
* Spencer Kelly

<text>A convocation (from the Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;to call/come together&quot;, a translation of the Greek &quot;ekklēsia&quot;) is a group of people formally assembled for a special purpose, mostly ecclesiastical or academic. The Britanica dictionary defines it as &quot;a large formal meeting of people (such as church officials)&quot;. 

In academic use, it can refer variously to the formal body of an institution&#x27;s alumni or to a ceremonial assembly of the university, particularly at a graduation or commencement ceremony but, at some institutions, for a ceremony at the start of the academic year to welcome incoming students.

==Ecclesiastical convocations==
A synodical assembly of a church is at times called &quot;Convocation&quot;.

===Convocations of Canterbury and York===
The Convocations of Canterbury and York were the synodical assemblies of the two Provinces of the Church of England until the Church Assembly was established in 1920. Their origins date back to the end of the seventh century when Theodore of Tarsus (Archbishop of Canterbury, 668-690) reorganized the structures of the English Church and established a national synod of bishops. With the recognition of York as a separate province in 733, this synod was divided into two. In 1225, representatives of the cathedral and monastic chapters were included for the first time and in 1285 the membership of the Convocation of Canterbury assumed the basic form which it retained till 1921: Bishops, Abbots (till the 1530s and the Dissolution of the Monasteries), Deans, and Archdeacons, plus one representative of each cathedral chapter and two for the clergy from each diocese. By the fifteenth century, each convocation was divided into an upper house (the Bishops) and a lower house (the remaining members). In 1921, the number of proctors (elected representatives) of the diocesan clergy was increased to make them a majority in the lower houses.

The Convocation of York was a relatively small part of the Church in England and Wales with only five member dioceses in Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. In 1462 it decided that all the provincial constitutions of Canterbury which were not repugnant or prejudicial to its own should be allowed in the Northern Province and by 1530 the Archbishop of York rarely attended sessions and the custom that York waited to see what Canterbury had decided and either accepted or rejected it was well established. The Convocation of York was, in practice, taking second place to that of Canterbury so much so that in 1852 the Archbishop of York Thomas Musgrave stated that since the time of Henry VIII the archbishop had only attended personally two sessions (in 1689 and 1708).

The legislative powers of the convocations varied considerably over the centuries. Until 1664, they (not Parliament) determined the taxes to be paid by the clergy, but their powers in general were severely curtailed by Henry VIII in 1532/4; and from the time of the Reformation till 1965 they were summoned and dissolved at the same time as Parliament. Under Henry VIII and his successor Edward VI between 1534 and 1553 the Convocations were used as a source of clerical opinion but ecclesiastical legislation was secured by statute from Parliament. Later, between 1559 and 1641, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I gave the force of law to decisions of Convocation without recourse to Parliament by letters patent under the great seal, notably the Thirty-Nine Articles (1571) and the 141 Canons of 1603.

The Convocations were abolished during the Commonwealth but restored on the accession of Charles II in 1660 and they synodically approved the Book of Common Prayer, which was imposed by the Act of Uniformity in 1662. Formal sessions at the start of each parliament continued but no real business was discussed until after the Revolution of 1688 which brought William III and Mary II to the throne, when attempts to include some of the Protestant dissenters met such resistance in the lower house that the government abandoned them and the Convocations resumed their purely formal meetings.

In 1697 Francis Atterbury published his &quot;Letter to a Convocation Man concerning the Rights, Powers and Privileges of that Body&quot; which, in essence, claimed that the Convocation was an estate of the realm like Parliament and that the lower clergy were being illegally disfranchised and denied its proper voice in government. Business was resumed in 1701 and by the time Queen Anne died in 1714 draft canons and forms of service had been drawn up for royal assent. However, there was an inherent tension between the two houses: the lower house was mainly Tory in its politics and high church in its doctrine, while the upper house was mainly Whig and latitudinarian and therefore in favour of toleration for Protestant dissenters and their possible reincorporation into the Church of England; feelings ran high until in 1717 the session was prorogued by Royal Writ to avoid the censuring of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly by the lower house (see the Bangorian controversy) and, with the exception of an abortive session in 1741, the Convocations met only for formal business at the beginning of each parliament until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Canterbury (in 1852) and York (in 1861) began to discuss issues of the day.

The resumption of proper business was brought about by the political changes which had taken place some twenty years earlier. Until the Great Reform Bill of 1832, Parliament had been theoretically an Anglican body, and many churchmen began to argue that neither Parliament nor the bishops in the House of Lords expressed the mind of the Church as a whole In 1847 the routine session at the beginning of a new Parliament coincided with the polemical nomination of Dr Hampden to the see of Hereford. The formal address to the Queen was debated for six hours and an amendment carried praying the Crown to revive the active powers of convocation. The driving force behind the campaign to achieve this was the London banker, Henry Hoare, who dedicated himself to the task. The opposition was formidable: half the clergy and most of the laity rejected the idea, many politicians were against it and the two archbishops—John Bird Sumner and Thomas Musgrave—had no desire to revive Convocation. The legal basis of the resistance was the claim that convocation could only discuss such business as was expressly specified by the Crown. Over the next eight years it was established that it could debate and act provided it did not try to discuss or frame canons and that the archbishop could only prorogue (adjourn) a session with the consent of his fellow diocesans. In 1851, Canterbury received a petition, in 1853 it appointed committees and by 1855 Archbishop Sumner was convinced of the value of Convocation and those bishops who had opposed the revival were taking part positively in its debates. Archbishop Musgrave maintained his opposition until his death in 1860—he even locked the room where it was due to meet—and the Northern Convocation remained inactive until his successor took office.

The Convocations have always been exclusively clerical assemblies. However, in 1885 the Convocations agreed to the establishment of parallel Houses of Laity elected by the lay members of the diocesan conferences. These were not part of Convocation; they had no constitutional status and were merely advisory. At the beginning of the twentieth century, both Convocations together with their respective houses of laity began to meet as a Representative Council which however had no legal authority or position. This was superseded in 1920 by the Church Assembly which was given the right to propose measures to Parliament by the &quot;Enabling Act of 1919&quot;. The Convocations still exist and their members constitute the two clerical houses of the General Synod but, apart from some residual and formal responsibilities, all legal authority is now vested in the Synod which was established in 1970.

==University use==

At universities, &quot;convocation&quot; can refer (particularly in North America) to a university&#x27;s graduation ceremony or, more generally, to any formal assembly of the university (similar to congregation in some British universities). At Harvard and Columbia universities it is the name used for the matriculation ceremony that formally welcomes new students at the start of the academic year.

At some universities in the UK and other countries, convocation refers to the body of the members of the university that meets to make official decisions. In the University of Oxford, convocation was originally the main governing body of the university, consisting of all doctors and masters of the university, but it now comprises all graduates of the university and its only remaining functions are to elect the chancellor of the university and the Professor of Poetry. (The equivalent body at Cambridge is the senate.)

At Durham University, convocation was established as the assembly of members of the university by the university&#x27;s fundamental statue in 1835. Women were admitted to convocation from 1913. Durham&#x27;s degrees were awarded at meetings of convocation until 1938, when this power was transferred to the senate and awards were instead made at congregations of the university. it consists of the chancellor, the vice-chancellor and warden, the deputy vice-chancellor and provost, the pro-vice-chancellors, graduates of the university who have registered as members of convocation, and other officers of the university appointed by the university&#x27;s council. It appoints the chancellor of the university, most recently Fiona Hill on 28 November 2022, and receives the annual report of the university. 

In the University of London, convocation, between its establishment in 1858 and its abolition in 2003, consisted of the university&#x27;s graduates who were involved in the university&#x27;s governance.

In New Zealand, universities have &quot;courts of convocation&quot; by which all graduates elect representatives to the institutions&#x27; governing bodies.

==Plot==
In 1969 New York, a gasoline tanker overturns on a highway ramp, spilling fuel into an electrical substation below ground and trapping two workers. Among the responding firefighters is veteran Frank Sullivan, who goes underground to rescue the workers against the direction of his commander. Despite the rising level of fuel and the sparking created by damaged electronics, Frank and another firefighter pull the workers out and escape just before a spark ignites a huge explosion. Frank returns safely home to his wife Julia and young son Johnny.

In 1999, John Sullivan is an NYPD detective still living in his childhood home. His girlfriend Samantha leaves him because she believes he is emotionally shut off, the result of his father Frank dying in a fire when John was six years old.

John&#x27;s lifelong friend and neighbor, Gordo, stops by to borrow fishing equipment and finds a Heathkit single-sideband ham radio that once belonged to Frank, but fails to get it working.

The night before the 30th anniversary of his father&#x27;s death, John is surprised to find the radio operating during a particularly intense occurrence of the aurora borealis, and has a brief conversation with another man concerning the 1969 World Series, which John is able to recount in specific detail.

He realizes from this and other details that he is communicating with his father on the same date in 1969, and warns him of the mistake that led to his death. At first, Frank is alarmed and refuses to believe, but the next day, while rescuing a runaway from a burning warehouse, he recalls John&#x27;s warning, changes his course, and survives the fire.

In 1999, John is suddenly struck with new memories of his father surviving until 1989. That night, he and Frank reconnect, and they share details of their lives. John warns Frank that he will eventually die in 1989 of lung cancer. With no further comment, Frank throws his cigarettes in the trash.

The next day, John discovers that his present has been changed in other unexpected ways. He and Frank have inadvertently prevented the death of the &quot;Nightingale&quot;, a serial killer who originally murdered three nurses in the 1960s and was never caught.

In the new modified reality, the Nightingale has now killed ten women, including John&#x27;s own mother Julia. John is now flooded with new memories of his mother&#x27;s death. To save her and the other future victims, John enlists Frank&#x27;s help in stopping the Nightingale before he can kill again. At first Frank begs off, claiming &quot;I&#x27;m just a fireman,&quot; but John is insistent.

Following information from John about the killings, Frank saves the first victim, but before he can rescue the second, the Nightingale subdues him, steals his driver&#x27;s license, and plants it on the next victim to frame Frank for the murder.

When Frank relates his experience, John realizes Frank&#x27;s wallet has the Nightingale&#x27;s fingerprints. John asks his father to hide the wallet somewhere in the house where John can find it 30 years later. Using the preserved fingerprints from the wallet, John identifies the Nightingale as Jack Shepard, a former NYPD detective.

In the original timeline, Shepard was a hospital patient under the care of Julia; when she left during her shift after learning of Frank&#x27;s death, an inexperienced doctor accidentally administered a medication that caused a fatal allergic reaction. Because Frank survived, Julia was there to prevent the error, thereby saving the Nightingale&#x27;s life -- but allowing her to become a subsequent victim.

In 1969, Frank&#x27;s close friend, and John&#x27;s future boss, homicide detective Satch DeLeon comes to Frank&#x27;s house to arrest him on suspicion of murder; he resists, and the radio is knocked over and damaged.

At the station, Frank attempts to explain to a highly skeptical Satch that he got his information about the Nightingale from speaking to his grown-up son John over the radio. He proves his innocence to Satch by accurately predicting the course of the 1969 World Series Game 5, including the highly unusual shoe polish play.

Escaping from the police station, Frank breaks into Shepard&#x27;s apartment, where he finds trophies from the murders. Shepard arrives and attacks Frank, who fends him off and, apparently, kills him after a foot chase and plunge into the river, thus ensuring Julia&#x27;s survival. Satch, having realized that Frank was telling the truth, goes to Shepard&#x27;s apartment and finds the victims&#x27; jewelry, exonerating Frank. At the same time, the police search the river for Shepard&#x27;s body, but find nothing.

Frank returns home and repairs the radio. While talking over the radio that night, Frank and John are each attacked by the 1969 and 1999 versions of Shepard. In 1969, Frank blows off Shepard&#x27;s right hand with a shotgun and he flees. In 1999, as Shepard pulls a gun on John and prepares to fire, the house changes rapidly around them and Shepard&#x27;s hand disappears. At that point, a now mid-60s Frank appears in the doorway and kills Shepard with his shotgun. He and John tearfully embrace, the timelines now repaired.

The film concludes with a softball game including John and his own little son, his now-wife Samantha (expecting another baby), his healthy and happy gray-haired parents, Satch, and Gordo, who has now become wealthy thanks to a stock tip fed to him in the past by John -- posing as a magical &quot;Santa Claus&quot; -- advising six-year-old Gordo to remember the &quot;magic word, Yahoo,&quot; which convinces him to invest in the internet company in his adulthood.

==Production==
The film was greenlighted for production on January 21, 1999. Sylvester Stallone was rumored to be taking the role of Frank Sullivan in 1997, but fell out of the deal after a dispute over his fee. Renny Harlin was rumored to be director on the film. Gregory Hoblit first read the script in November 1997, eighteen months after his father&#x27;s death. In a 2000 interview shortly after the American release of &quot;Frequency&quot;, he described the film as &quot;high risk&quot; since the project had already been passed among several directors, including one of note who had twice the budget Hoblit was given. In the same interview, he described the difficulty he had finding the two leads. Hoblit realized he needed an &quot;experienced actor&quot; to portray Frank Sullivan and thus chose Dennis Quaid.

==Release==
Two weeks before its release, a sneak preview of the film was shown in &quot;Final Destination&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Frequency&quot; was released on DVD on October 31, 2000 and on VHS on April 3, 2001. It was later released on Blu-ray on July 10, 2012 by Warner Home Video.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Frequency&quot; was released at 2,631 theaters, making $9 million during its opening weekend. Eventually, the film grossed $45 million domestically and $23.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $68,106,245.

===Critical response===
&quot;Frequency&quot; received generally positive reviews. Based on 127 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 70% approval rating with an average rating of 6.5/10. The consensus reads, &quot;A tight blend of surprises and suspense keeps audiences spellbound.&quot; On Metacritic — which assigns a weighted mean score — the film has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average score of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert called the film&#x27;s plot &quot;contrived&quot;, yet gave the film a favorable review. He also pointed out similarities with the films &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;. David Armstrong, of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, praised the moments in the film when John and Frank Sullivan talked to each other over the ham radio but criticized the &quot;unintentionally funny climax.&quot; He also praised actor Shawn Doyle&#x27;s performance as the Nightingale killer, calling him &quot;convincingly creepy.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said despite Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel&#x27;s physical separation in the film, they formed a &quot;palpable bond that [gave] the picture its tensile strength&quot;. McCarthy noted that screenwriter Toby Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;bold leap into reconfiguring the past&quot; created &quot;agreeable surprises&quot; and an &quot;infinite number of possibilities&quot; to the plot&#x27;s direction. He added, however, that the serial killer subplot was &quot;desperately familiar&quot;. 
James Berardinelli gave the film two stars out of four, criticizing the &quot;coincidence-laden climax&quot; but wrote that &quot;poor writing [did] not demand subpar acting&quot;, praising &quot;Frequency&quot;&#x27;s &quot;few nice performances&quot;.

The American Radio Relay League assisted in some of the technical aspects in the film, though some ham radio enthusiasts criticized technical errors that made it into the film.

&quot;Frequency&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, but ultimately lost out to &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;. The film&#x27;s ending song, &quot;When You Come Back to Me Again&quot;, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Written by Jenny Yates and Garth Brooks (performed only by Brooks), the song failed to win, losing out to &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;.

==Television adaptations==

In November 2014, it was reported that &quot;Supernatural&quot; showrunner Jeremy Carver was in talks to produce a new television series adaptation/reboot based on the film for television network NBC. The film&#x27;s writer Toby Emmerich is attached to serve as a producer for the series. NBC passed on it, and a pilot was ordered at The CW in January 2016. The series was canceled after one season on May 8, 2017.

While not a television adaptation, &quot;Frequency&quot; was briefly parodied in the &quot;Reno 911&quot; episode &quot;Wiegel&#x27;s New Boyfriend&quot;, where the Reno officers respond to a house fire and are urged by the homeowner to &quot;save his novel,&quot; which turns out to mirror the plot of &quot;Frequency&quot;. The Reno officers proceed to spoil the ending of the &quot;novel&quot; (based on them having seen the movie), causing the homeowner to suddenly become ambivalent about having his novel saved from the flames.

<text>The Software Engineering 2004 (SE2004) —formerly known as Computing Curriculum Software Engineering (CCSE)— is a document that provides recommendations for undergraduate education in software engineering. SE2004 was initially developed by a steering committee between 2001 and 2004. Its development was sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. Important components of SE2004 include the Software Engineering Education Knowledge, a list of topics that all graduates should know, as well as a set of guidelines for implementing curricula and a set of proposed courses.

<doc id="531753" wikidata="Q2724163" url="?curid=531753" title="Ergophobia">
<text>Ergophobia (also referred to as ergasiophobia or ponophobia) is described as an extreme and debilitating fear associated with work (manual labor, non-manual labor, etc.), a fear of finding or losing employment, or fear of specific tasks in the workplace. The term &quot;ergophobia&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;&quot; (work) and &quot;phobos&quot; (fear).

Ergophobia is not specifically defined in the DSM-5. Criteria can be accounted for under the category of &quot;Other&quot; specific phobia 300.29 (F40.298).

Features of ergophobia are often consistent with social phobia or performance anxiety, specifically irrational anxiety about the work and the workplace environment. This can include the fear of failing at assigned tasks, public speaking at the workplace, performance anxiety, fear of socialising with co-workers, and fear of emotional, psychological and/or physical injuries at work.

== Phobias ==
A phobia is a psychological condition in which an individual has a persisting fear of a situation or object that disproportionate to the threat they actually pose. This condition stems from one&#x27;s need to constantly be alert and avoid the source of the phobia that results in of psychological distress. Phobias can be specific to a certain stimulus or general to social situations. The most effective treatment for phobias is exposure therapy.

Phobias are often associated with a range of other mental health disorders: depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorders, substance abuse and personality disorders. There is a potential connection between executive dysfunction and work-related anxiety. 

== Symptoms ==
Ergophobia has both physical and psychological symptoms associated with fear and avoidance of the work environment. A study focused on burnout among teachers concluded that those experiencing ergophobia performed significantly worse on a physical health index compared to their colleagues. Physical symptoms of ergopobia can include rapid heart rate, dry mouth, excessive sweating, general uneasiness, and panic attacks. Ergophobia is also described as causing impairment at work including inability to meet work requirements, difficulty keeping a job, avoidance of taking on additional work responsibility, ruminating on negative work situation or challenges at work, and disengagement from the workplace. 

== History and measurement ==
Ergophobia is a controversial concept, and in the past has been dismissed as laziness. William Upson defined it as &quot;the art of laziness&quot; and &quot;morbid fear or hatred of work&quot;. Ergophobia was mentioned by a hospital in New Jersey in the 1860s. 

Ergophobia is considered by some to be a corollary of occupational burnout, which is thought to be the result of long-term unresolvable job stress. The term &quot;burnout&quot; did not come to be used with regularity until the 1970s in the United States. Freudenberger, for example, used it to describe the phenomenon of physical and emotional exhaustion, with associated negative attitudes arising from intense interactions when working with people. Burnout appears to be more common in occupations include health care and mental health care professionals, social welfare workers, lawyers, and business organization employees.

Although there is no formal diagnosis procedure for ergophobia or burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory – a series of introspective occupational burnout questions, is used together with the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS) to assess levels of burnout. These tests measure emotional burnout, depersonalization, and personal achievements, and are suitable for both individual and group assessment.

== Similar syndromes ==
A similar syndrome as ergophobia is seen in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), where one experiences uncontrollably elevated levels of anxiety and worries over varying issues and events. As with phobias, individuals with GAD experience anxiety that is disproportionate to the actual threat a situation poses. Adults with GAD can feel stressed by work-related concerns regarding everyday tasks, evaluations, and presentations.

Social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, is characterized by feelings of anxiety induced by social interactions or situations, in which the individual may be scrutinized or rejected by others. This anxiety is easily exacerbated by work-related situations such as presentations, professional and friendly social interactions at the workplace.

Additionally, &quot;Other specified Anxiety Disorder&quot; also causes distress and significant levels of anxiety, but not in a manner that fully embodies the diagnostic symptoms of anxiety disorders. This disorder greatly influences performance in social, occupational or other important situations, therefore may seem similar to Ergophobia or occupational burnout.

== In culture ==
The number of ergophobia cases increases with the number of people working in an ergophobia conducting environment, regardless of changes in the rates reported of ergophobia itself. The changing circumstances of employer-employee relations has also been significantly altered by this evolution to a service-based economy. Performance appraisal systems are now a popular tool within organizations to enhance employee commitment and productivity. Such systems can exacerbate emotional exhaustion among employees and subsequently feelings of burnout or ergophobia.

Proliferation of mental health awareness discourses in popular Western culture may lead to mis- or overdiagnosis of mental illness. As the fear of work itself is such a general catchall term, many may mistakenly believe they suffer from ergophobia when in fact, they are simply dealing with occupational stress, or are afflicted by other mental health issues such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder or social anxiety disorder.

<text>Kevin William Crompton (born February 13, 1961), known professionally as cEvin Key, is a Canadian musician, songwriter, producer, and composer. He is best known as a member of the industrial music group Skinny Puppy, which he co-founded in 1982 with singer Nivek Ogre. Initially a side project while he was with the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy quickly became his primary musical outlet after landing a record deal with Nettwerk Records in 1984.

When Skinny Puppy disbanded in 1995 following the death of keyboardist Dwayne Goettel, Key&#x27;s main project became the electronic noise group Download, whose first album, &quot;Furnace&quot;, was released that same year. His first solo album, &quot;Music For Cats&quot;, was released in 1998 on Subconscious Communications, an independent record label he took over following Goettel&#x27;s death. He reunited with Ogre in 2000 for a one-off performance as Skinny Puppy at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden. The pair officially reformed Skinny Puppy in 2003 and released &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; a year later. They have since released the albums &quot;Mythmaker&quot;, &quot;HanDover&quot;, and &quot;Weapon&quot;.
In addition to his work with Skinny Puppy and Download, Key has had several side projects, most notably The Tear Garden, a project started in 1985 with Legendary Pink Dots singer Edward Ka-Spel. His other projects include platEAU, Doubting Thomas, Cyberaktif, and Hilt.

==Early life==
Key was raised in Vancouver in what he considered a dysfunctional family. Due to an alcohol problem their father developed following his service in World War II, he and his siblings, an older brother and younger sister, had to learn to fend for themselves at a young age. His mother, who he considered &quot;glammy&quot;, often put makeup on him and was untroubled with his use of marijuana. His father initially disapproved of his behavior, but changed his attitude when Key began dyeing his hair at the age of 17 and would later come to fully support his career as a musician. Key would often turn to music as a way to escape his home life and the difficulties of high school, and he soon found himself learning to use drums and synthesizers.

I had a weird and very dysfunctional family. There&#x27;s no training for dysfunction ... Luckily my family had a piano and an organ that had one of those weird drum machines in it, and I sort of had the luck to be able to have these things around me, to take out frustrations on.

In 1978, his parents sent him to live in Japan with a Japanese family, an experience that he considered valuable to his development as an individual. He was required to learn Japanese as his surrogate family, who treated him as a son, could not speak English. He said of his experience: &quot;When you are that age, a whole new culture is a major upheaval. But for the better&quot;. He had been planning to live in Japan and was offered a job at a Tokyo radio station as an interviewer when he received an invite from Gary Smith to join Images in Vogue.

==Career==
===Early musical work===
Key began his career in the late 70s playing as a drummer for the Vancouver rock band Bastille. He also performed as a multi-instrumentalist in the punk band Illegal Youth, which featured Al Nelson, the future vocalist of Hilt. In 1981, Key joined Images in Vogue, a successful new wave group based in Vancouver who had put out an ad looking for musicians with their own equipment. Dave Ogilvie, a local music student, also joined the group as a producer and engineer. Taking up the role as the band&#x27;s drummer, Key utilized a Simmons electronic drum kit. The band found success touring throughout Canada and opening for groups such as Depeche Mode and Roxy Music.

Images in Vogue released their first single, &quot;Breaking Up&quot;, in April 1982, and their first EP, &quot;Educated Man&quot;, shortly thereafter. The EP was a success, selling 10,000 copies in a span of six weeks and topping a number of college radio station playlists. Bill Leeb, Key&#x27;s friend from Vancouver&#x27;s late-night club circuit, had introduced him to early industrial bands such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, and he soon found himself recording his own songs.

Key met Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie) at a party in late 1982 and asked him to provide vocals for the songs he had made. Ogre accepted and the pair recorded the song &quot;K-9&quot; under the name Skinny Puppy. The pair began using stage names to avoid the confusion of having two people named Kevin in the same band. Key left Images in Vogue in 1985 shortly after the release of their first album, &quot;In the House&quot;, to focus solely on Skinny Puppy.

===Skinny Puppy===
According to Key, the concept behind Skinny Puppy was to create music from the point of view of a dog whose &quot;tail’s trodden on&quot; and can only bark and growl. The self-published EP &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot; was released in 1984; only 35 copies of the tape were produced. Key brought in Leeb (under the name Wilhelm Schroeder) and Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie to help record their second EP, &quot;Remission&quot;. Terry McBride helped pay for the production and signed them to his new indie label, Nettwerk Records. A follow-up LP, &quot;Bites&quot;, was released the following year.

Key hired Dwayne Goettel to play with Skinny Puppy in 1986 after it had become apparent that Leeb was uninterested in touring. Key felt that Goettel&#x27;s technical abilities and knowledge of sampling helped give the band a new identity. Key&#x27;s partnership with Goettel strained his relationship with Ogre, who they felt was more interested in pursuing a solo career. Key was displeased with Ogre inviting Al Jourgensen for the 1989 production of &quot;Rabies&quot;, telling &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that he believed Jorgensen had intended to break the band up. Key&#x27;s relationship with Ogre continued to worsen during the recording of &quot;Last Rights&quot;. In a 1991 interview with &quot;Propaganda&quot; magazine, he expressed his frustration regarding the recording of the album:

Ogre is a different person from what I first knew, and I just can&#x27;t bear to deal with it. It&#x27;s something that I have to walk away from ... Every year there seems to be a promise and hope that we&#x27;ll be able to talk, and we&#x27;ll forget about all the things that have a lot to do with ego. Forget about ego and get into the studio and do something we originally wanted to do, which is just to make music that we&#x27;ll listen to and be genuine fans of.

When their contract with Nettwerk ended in 1992, the band signed with Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings and moved to Los Angeles to begin recording &quot;The Process&quot;. Ogre quit the band in 1995 and Goettel died of a heroin overdose shortly thereafter; Key managed to salvage &quot;The Process&quot;, and released it in 1996. He disbanded Skinny Puppy following Goettel&#x27;s death, saying, &quot;I found it appropriate at the time to put an end to the group ... It&#x27;s always difficult when you lose a close friend like that&quot;. In 1998, Key ran into Ogre at a Bauhaus reunion concert and discussed the possibility of working together in the future. As his relationship with Ogre improved, German promoters began asking if they would be interested in performing as Skinny Puppy once more. On August 20, 2000, Key and Ogre reunited in for a one-off performance as Skinny Puppy at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, and in 2001 Key performed with Ogre as a touring drummer for the latter&#x27;s ohGr project.

The pair reformed Skinny Puppy in 2003 and signed with European label SPV, releasing &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; a year later. Key said that the way the band recorded music had not changed much from before, but that the advancement of technology had greatly improved the process. The band followed the album with the release of &quot;Mythmaker&quot; in 2007 and &quot;HanDover&quot; in 2011. Skinny Puppy released the album &quot;Weapon&quot; in 2013 and later sent an invoice totaling $666,000 to the US Department of Defense for the use of its music during torture sessions at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Key explained that he was troubled by the use of their music as a means of torture and that the invoice was not meant for &quot;financial gain&quot;.

===Download===
Download was created by Key and Goettel as a Skinny Puppy side project in 1995. Other members included Anthony Valic, Ken Marshall, Phil Western, and Mark Spybey from Dead Voices on Air. Download was named after the closing track off &quot;Last Rights&quot; and sought to create music by way of &quot; fragments of sound and collages&quot;. Key told &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine that he thought of Goettel as &quot;an unrecognized pioneer&quot; of electronic music and, following Goettel&#x27;s death, used Download as a means of keeping his spirit alive.

I heard things that I&#x27;ve never heard before coming out of Dwayne&#x27;s end of stuff. Typically, only a small percentage of it got saved or recorded in actual pieces. I know what I learned from Dwayne. He was a brilliant teacher and he&#x27;s really blown a lot of people away.

Download released their first album, &quot;Furnace&quot;, in 1995. The album was dedicated to Goettel&#x27;s memory and featured contributions from Genesis P-Orridge. They followed up their debut with two EPs in 1996, &quot;Microscopic&quot; and &quot;Sidewinder&quot;. The band released their second full length effort, &quot;The Eyes of Stanley Pain&quot;, through Nettwerk Records. Key would use live performances to play &quot;Download versions&quot; of songs from old projects like Skinny Puppy. He said, &quot;we don&#x27;t sing Ogre&#x27;s lyrics. We do instrumental versions of key segments of some of the older material&quot;. &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Family&quot;, produced by the band as the soundtrack for Jim Van Bebber&#x27;s film of the same name, was given a limited release before the film&#x27;s completion. Van Bebber, who had done video work for Skinny Puppy, approached Key to write music for the film; Key&#x27;s goal in making the soundtrack was to create something that was &quot;uneasy, unsettling, just plain old uncomfortable&quot;. The album &quot;III&quot; was released on October 21, 1997, and acted as a companion piece to &quot;The Eyes of Stanley Pain&quot;. With &quot;III&quot;, Key began to tone down the industrial aspects of his style for a more electronica sound.

The band continued into the new millennium with the release of &quot;Effector&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Fixer&quot; in 2007. In late 2018, Key announced that he and Western had finished work on a new album titled &quot;Unknown Room&quot; and that it would be released March 8, 2019, through Artoffact Records. According to a press release, the album resulted from &quot;an intense two month studio session&quot; following several years of on-off production.

===The Tear Garden===
Key came in contact with The Legendary Pink Dots by way of &quot;The Elephant Table&quot;, a compilation tape shared within the tape trading community. He met Pink Dots singer Edward Ka-Spel in 1985 while working as a sound engineer on Ka-Spel&#x27;s solo tour. Key presented Ka-Spel with some recordings he had made, believing that Ka-Spel&#x27;s voice would work well with them; Ka-Spel agreed after listening to the tapes. The pair formed The Tear Garden soon after and, with Dave Ogilvie as producer, released a self-titled EP later in the year. Goettel joined Key and Ka-Spel for the release of &quot;Tired Eyes Slowly Burning&quot; in 1987. The album featured the song &quot;You and Me and Rainbows&quot;, which ran close to 17 minutes long. The album was noted for using a mixture of psychedelia and electronic influences.

The band released the albums &quot;The Last Man to Fly&quot; and &quot;Sheila Liked the Rodeo&quot; in 1992, both the product of a single five hour recording session. Key said that most of the material from &quot;Sheila Liked the Rodeo&quot; was recorded by engineers in secret while the band was in the midst of a jam session. Key said of the recording session:

There&#x27;s a certain greatness to knowing that the tape isn&#x27;t rolling and knowing that the song that you&#x27;re playing is simply the last time you&#x27;ll ever hear it, if your in a jamming, improvisational mode. And then going in and hearing that somebody actually recorded it is just ... the ultimate gift I guess.

Their 1996 album &quot;To Be an Angel Blind, the Crippled Soul Divide&quot; featured a more subdued style in the wake of Goettel&#x27;s death, and they returned in 2000 to release &quot;Crystal Mass&quot;. Starting in 2016, the band ran a successful PledgeMusic campaign to support their new album, &quot;The Brown Acid Caveat&quot;, which was released on July 7, 2017.

===Subconscious Communications and solo work===
Goettel and Western had created the label Subconscious Communications in 1993 as a means of releasing material for the aDuck project. Following Goettel&#x27;s death, Key took control of the label and initially used it to release Download and Tear Garden albums. He later opened the label to other musicians, particularly those he had worked with in the past. The unsupportive attitude taken by American Recordings during the production of &quot;The Process&quot; led to the construction of the Subconscious studio, where most of Key&#x27;s projects are recorded and manufactured. He believed the creation of the label was a natural consequence to being involved in the music industry and used it to &quot;license the appropriate releases to the appropriate labels&quot;. The labels Subconscious Communications worked with included Cleopatra Records, Metropolis Records, and Nettwerk, among others.

Key&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Music for Cats&quot;, was released on February 3, 1998. The album&#x27;s subtitle read “Subconscious Music Orchestra under the direction of CEvin Key”. The album was made by assembling unused music from &quot;The Process&quot; into &quot;collages of free-form ambience&quot;. He used his pet cats to help make portions the album, sometimes allowing them to walk across keyboards to see what sounds they would come up with. He moved Subconscious Communications to Los Angeles in 1998 and worked on his next solo album, &quot;The Ghost of Each Room&quot;, which was released on August 14, 2001. The album featured vocal work by Ogre on the track &quot;Frozen Sky&quot;. The artwork for his next album, &quot;The Dragon Experience&quot;, featured Spencer Elden who had been featured on the cover of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;. The photo, taken by Key&#x27;s girlfriend, was inspired by a dream he had at age 11.

In 2011, Key held the SUBcon Beyond Fest in Santa Monica which featured a number of artists signed Subconscious Communications, including Phil Western, Mark Spybey, Download, PlaTEAU, and Tokyo Decadence, and local talent such as Cyrusrex and Wet Mango. Using the name Scaremeister, Key released &quot;31 Spirits&quot; in 2014, a compilation of musical pieces he produced for horror film trailers. The name Scaremeister came when Arnold Schwarzenegger referred to Key as &quot;the scare meister&quot; while he finished work on the score for &quot;End of Days&quot;. In 2018, Key released &quot;Brap and Forth vol. 8&quot;, a collection of early musical experiments from before Skinny Puppy.

===Other projects===
Cyberaktif is a collaboration between key and Bill Leeb from the band Front Line Assembly, Their first album, &quot;Tenebrae Vision&quot;, was released in 1991 through Wax Trax! Records. featuring the late Dwayne Goettel acting predominantly as a support musician. The song “Paradiessets” featured vocals from Blixa Bargeld of Einstürzende Neubauten. In February 2024, Cyberaktif released a new album titled &quot;eNdgame&quot;, featuring the lineup of cEvin Key, Bill Leeb, and Rhys Fulber. The band Hilt, a collaboration between Key and Geottel, and Al Nelson, started when Nettwerk challenged the group to produce an album for as little money as possible. The group released two albums, &quot;Call the Ambulance Before I Hurt Myself&quot; and &quot;Journey to the Center of the Bowl&quot;, in 1990 and 1991, respectively, before Nelson&#x27;s death in 2000. In 2018, Key released a number of rediscovered recordings from when the band was called &quot;The Flu&quot;. Another collaboration started by Key and Goettel in 1990 was Doubting Thomas, the purpose of which was to produce &quot;soundtracks for movies that never existed&quot;. They released their sole album, &quot;The Infidel&quot;, in 1991 through Wax Trax! Records.

Following the disbandment of Skinny puppy in 1995, Key formed PlaTEAU with Western and Valic. PlatEAU, which signed to Cleopatra subsidiary Hypnotic, released their first album, &quot;Music for Grass Bars&quot;, on May 20, 1997. The band&#x27;s follow-up, 1999&#x27;s &quot;SpacEcake&quot;, was described by &quot;Exclaim!&quot;&#x27;s Matt Mernagh as being more akin to Aphex Twin and Autechre than any of Key&#x27;s previous work. 2007 saw the release of &quot;Kushbush + Music for Grass Bars&quot;, the first disc of which contained new music while the second disc featured a special edition of &quot;Music for Grass Bars&quot;.

==Musical style==
Key&#x27;s initial interest in experimenting with electronic music came from a dream he had as a kid; this dream was depicted on the cover of his 2003 album &quot;The Dragon Experience&quot;. Later on, he discovered a publication called &quot;Contact List for Electronic Music&quot; by Alex Douglas, which introduced him to the tape-trading community. He named Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Portion Control, and the album &quot;The Bridge&quot; by Thomas Leer and Robert Rental as early influences on Skinny Puppy. In an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, he mentioned Fad Gadget, The Human League, John Foxx, Bourbonese Qualk, and Mark Stewart as having a large impact on him in his youth. He credits his style of drumming to an interest in Latin and African percussion, as well as rap music, industrial music, and early 70s rock.

Key&#x27;s improvisational method for creating Skinny Puppy music was done through what was called &quot;brap&quot;, which means &quot;getting together, hooking up electronic instruments, getting high, and recording&quot;. His approach to Download differed from Skinny Puppy in that he intended to create a &quot;centre-less musical entity, unanchored by the presence of a frontman&quot; and explore the more experimental characteristics of his previous work. He said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I strive to be unsettling. I think that that&#x27;s simply what attracts me to make the sound and hopefully achieve the result that will make that journey interesting for me&quot;. He told &quot;Chart&quot; magazine in 1998 that he considered acts such as The Prodigy, Aphex Twin, and Basic Channel to be at the forefront of the electronica scene.

Key mentioned that the intention behind Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music was to create something that had its own unique and original sound, set apart from groups such as Nitzer Ebb, which he considered &quot;all beat and no music, with lyrics that don&#x27;t capture what Ogre does&quot;. In a 1990 interview with &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;, Key was apprehensive in classifying his music as industrial, saying that the success of Ministry and Nine Inch Nails had caused the scene to lose sight of its original goal and identity:

[The scene started as] a cool artsy kind of thing and it&#x27;s sort of grown into something more mainstream ... They&#x27;re just doing what they can to get themselves in the position of being seen as cool ... For me to say that it shouldn&#x27;t exist would be censorship and would be completely everything I&#x27;m against. But be sure there are people trying to use this as a step ladder to crotch-rock riviera.

Key considered the Lexicon PCM 41 delay to be an essential piece of equipment for his early music, and said that he didn&#x27;t believe &quot;any of our music could be in existence without a digital delay&quot;. He made frequent use of instruments such as the Roland TR-808 and Roland TR-909 drum machines, which proved central to his original setup for Skinny Puppy, and the ARP 2600. His first experience with modular synthesizers was when a member of Psychic TV brought in a Serge panel for the recording of &quot;The Process&quot;. For live performances, he uses a Moog synthesizer, Roland V-Synth, Ashun Sound Machines Hydrasynth, Teenage Engineering OP-1, and an array of analog effects triggers such as a Pearl Syncussion SY-1.

==Personal life==
Key considers himself a pacifist and is a keen animal lover and supporter of animal rights. He is especially fond of cats and made a dedication to them on his 1998 solo album &quot;Music for Cats&quot;, claiming they played a major role in his upbringing. &quot;I&#x27;m a cat lover, and cats have basically been keeping me my whole life&quot;. His affection for cats came from his mother, who was a cat trainer and breeder. Out of his siblings, he described himself as the only one who lived &quot;out-on-the-edge&quot; and said that they had led successful careers in their chosen fields. His older brother, who left the family home at 17, became an artist and designer, while his younger sister became a legal secretary. His mother died early in 1985. He stopped using hard drugs in 1994 and supports the decriminalization of marijuana. In a 1998 interview with &quot;Chart&quot; magazine, he said his choice to stay away from drugs had been a relatively easy decision in light of Goettel&#x27;s death:

 The recovery from heroin is a really bitter road. It&#x27;s like you have to get over the flu before you can walk. And I think Dwayne got stuck. He wasn&#x27;t able to [recover] ... I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. July &#x27;94 was the last time I did hard drugs. There is no risk for me, you know; &quot;oh, I&#x27;ll just do one line.&quot; I know I&#x27;ll feel like shit in the morning. I hate it. I don&#x27;t even get drunk anymore. I just smoke pot.

Key endured several injuries while performing a stunt on the set of Gregg Araki&#x27;s &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;. According to Ogre, Key fell from the top of a car, landing face first on the pavement. He suffered a broken kneecap, and required 31 stitches, eight of which were on his face.
In 2016, Key had reconstructive surgery on his nose and face following the removal of a basal-cell carcinoma. He said in a Facebook update that the cancer had started in his nose before spreading up to his eye and down to his lip. He had a similar surgery 15 years before which left a large scar on his nose.

<text>The University of Cambridge Computing Service provided computing facilities across the University of Cambridge between 1970 and 2014. It was located primarily on the New Museums Site, Free School Lane, in the centre of Cambridge, England but, in September 2013 moved to the Roger Needham Building on the West Cambridge site.

The Computing Service shares a common ancestry with the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Founded on 14 May 1937 &quot;to provide a computing service for general use, and to be a centre for the development of computational techniques in the University&quot; as the &quot;Mathematical Laboratory&quot; (under the leadership of John Lennard-Jones), it was not until 2001 that the provision of computing services across the University and Colleges was fully separated from computing research and teaching.

On 30 March 2014, the Computing Service merged with the Management Information Services Division (MISD) of the Unified Administrative Service (UAS) to create the University Information Services department.

<doc id="531761" wikidata="Q3269553" url="?curid=531761" title="Craft unionism">
<text>Craft unionism refers to a model of trade unionism in which workers are organised based on the particular craft or trade in which they work. It contrasts with industrial unionism, in which all workers in the same industry are organized into the same union, regardless of differences in skill.

Under this approach, each union is organized according to the craft, or specific work function, of its members. For example, in the building trades, all carpenters belong to the carpenters&#x27; union, the plasterers join the plasterers&#x27; union, and the painters belong to the painters&#x27; union. Each craft union has its own administration, its own policies, its own collective bargaining agreements and its own union halls.

==Origins==
The first unions established in Russia in the early nineteenth century tended, by nature of the industries in which their members worked, to be craft unions: shoemakers, cordwainers (shoemakers who work with cordovan leather) and typesetters all worked, as a rule, in small shops in which they had little contact with workers in other fields. Some of these early unions also came out of a guild tradition in which skilled workmen often owned their own shops or, if they worked for another, had a good deal of control over how the work was done, which they policed by maintaining standards for admission into the trade; requiring entrants to go through an apprenticeship program controlled by the union, rather than the employer; and dictating the processes, tools, standards, and pace of work. These traditions persisted into the 20th century in fields such as printing (in which the International Typographical Union would enforce its own rules determining how work was done in union shops) and the construction industry.

== History ==

Workers carried these patterns of organizing into new industries as well. The railroad brotherhoods, the unions formed in the latter half of the nineteenth century, made minute distinctions between groups that worked alongside each other; as an example, more than twenty years passed between the original chartering of the International Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen and the amendment of its charter to permit the union to represent the oilers and helpers who worked with them. Those who saw themselves at the top of the ladder took their elevated status very seriously; as an example, locomotive engineers on many railroads made a point of wearing top hats and a good suit of clothes while at work to demonstrate that they did not get their hands dirty or perform manual labor.

These craft distinctions in the railroad industry were remarkably long-lived; the Railway Labor Act, passed in 1925, recognized the prevailing pattern of division of the workforce into &quot;crafts&quot; and &quot;classes&quot; and the separate craft patterns persisted into the late twentieth century. While both the Knights of Labor and Eugene V. Debs&#x27; American Railway Union attempted to organize railroad workers on an industrial basis, those efforts were defeated, in some cases by government intervention, injunctions, and force of arms.

The attempt to impose craft distinctions in other industries was not so successful. In the steel industry, for example, after the routing of the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers in its titanic strike against Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s steel operations at Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892, and the defeat, a generation later, of the 1919 steel strike, the craft unions within the AFL claimed that any attempt to organize steel workers must recognize their separate craft jurisdictions: workers who used bricks to build kilns or similar structures would have to belong to the brick masons union, workers who sawed wood to build structures within the plant should be carpenters, and so forth. Those demands effectively ruled out any possibility of organizing the industry.

In other cases unions within the AFL organized on an industrial basis: the United Mine Workers, the United Brewery Workers and the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union admitted to membership all workers in the industry, or attached to it. Even in those unions, however, craft distinctions sometimes surfaced. In the ILGWU, for example, the cutters, who were often primarily of English, Irish, and German stock, were almost exclusively males, were better paid, and were typically more skilled, often looked down on the immigrant, largely female, unskilled &quot;operators&quot; who ran sewing machines in their shops or elsewhere. The ILGWU also tended to group its workers based on seemingly trivial distinctions between the type of garment they produced: among the locals created by the ILGWU in the first decade of its existence was one titled the Wrapper, Kimono and House Dress Makers&#x27; Union. Decades later, as the industry changed, it created sportwear locals.

==Challenges==

As long as the craft unions were the dominant power in the AFL, they took every step possible to block the organizing of mass production industries. This led to challenges from both inside and outside the Federation.

One early challenge came from outside: the Western Federation of Miners, a union that had fought a series of violent battles with mine owners over the right to represent mill workers as well as hard rock miners, joined with activists from other unions and from the Socialist Labor Party of America to form the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which aimed to organize all workers, regardless of craft, nationality, gender or race, into one big union. In practical terms the IWW pursued organizing on an industrial basis.

In at least one sense the IWW practiced (and practices) the most egalitarian form of industrial unionism, organizing and accepting membership of workers in any given industry whether they are currently employed or not. The IWW also welcomed immigrant workers, minorities and women as equals.

The IWW was successful in some cases, leading a strike of immigrant workers employed in the woolens industry in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and many smaller strikes in longshore, agriculture and the lumber industry. In its first three years it was greatly hampered by deep political divisions, such as the question of unions engaging in electoral politics (resolved in favor of ruling out alliances with political parties). The IWW was seriously damaged by government prosecution and vigilantism in the post-war red scare that reached its peak in 1919, and in the Palmer Raids of the same period.

The next challenge to the dominance of craft unions within the AFL came from inside, as John L. Lewis of the Mine Workers, David Dubinsky of the ILGWU, Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, Charles Howard of the International Typographical Union, Thomas McMahon, head of the United Textile Workers, John Sheridan of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union (the descendant of the WFM), Harvey Fremming from the Oil Workers Union and Max Zaritsky of the Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers joined to form a Committee for Industrial Organizing within the AFL. The craft unions demanded that Lewis and his committee stop; Lewis persisted.

This dispute came to a head at the AFL’s convention in Atlantic City in 1935, when William Hutcheson, the President of the Carpenters, made a slighting comment about a member of the fledgling union of tire factory workers who was delivering an organizing report. Lewis responded that Hutcheson’s comment was &quot;small potatoes&quot;, to which Hutcheson replied &quot;I was raised on small potatoes, that is why I am so small.&quot; After some more words Lewis punched Hutcheson, knocking him to the ground, then relit his cigar and returned to the rostrum. The incident personified the conflict between craft and industrial organizing. The CIO proceeded to organize mass production workers on an industrial basis.

The AFL&#x27;s response to the challenge from the CIO was twofold: both fighting a rearguard action before the National Labor Relations Board to preserve its right to represent the skilled trades in many of the plants that the CIO was organizing and attempting to emulate it. Thus, within a decade of the founding of the CIO, unions that had been primarily craft unions, such as the International Association of Machinists, originally a railroad union with much of its membership in the construction industry, began to make serious efforts to organize on an industrial basis as well. Even the Carpenters took in sawmill workers who had organized on an industrial basis, although the union continued to treat them as second-class members until they seceded to form the International Woodworkers of America in 1937.

==Persistence==
Craft unionism has receded in many industries as a result of changes in technology, the concentration of ownership and jurisdictional conflicts between craft unions. Craft unionism has not, however, disappeared: it is still the norm in the airline industry, survives despite much upheaval in the construction industry, and even appears, in very muted form, in some mass production industries, such as automobile manufacturing, where skilled trades employees have pressed their own agendas within the union.

<doc id="531770" wikidata="Q1935273" url="?curid=531770" title="Milk float">
<text>A milk float is a vehicle specifically designed for the delivery of fresh milk. Today, milk floats are usually battery electric vehicles (BEV), but they were formerly horse-drawn floats. They were once common in many European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, and were operated by local dairies. However, in recent years, as the number of supermarkets, small independent grocers and petrol stations, and convenience stores stocking fresh milk has increased, many people have switched from regular home delivery to obtaining fresh milk from these other sources.

==Characteristics==

Because of the relatively small power output from its electric motor, a milk float travels fairly slowly, usually around although some have been modified to attain speeds of up to . Operators often exit their vehicle before they have completely stopped to speed up deliveries; milk floats generally have sliding doors that can be left open when moving, or may have no doors at all. Electric milk floats come in three-wheel and four-wheel versions, the latter normally larger. They are very quiet, suiting operations in residential areas during the early hours of the morning or during the night.

Most electric milk floats do not have seat belts, and the law in the United Kingdom only requires wearing seat belts where these are fitted in the vehicle. While there was previously an exemption in the law meaning those making local deliveries were not required to wear seat belts, which would in theory have included drivers and passengers in milk floats with seat belts fitted, the law was changed in 2005 to deliveries less than apart.

==Statistics==

In August 1967, the UK Electric Vehicle Association put out a press release stating that Britain had more battery-electric vehicles on its roads than the rest of the world combined. It is not clear what research the association had undertaken into the number of electric vehicles of other countries, but closer inspection disclosed that almost all of the battery-driven vehicles licensed for UK road use were milk floats.

Glasgow has one of the largest working milk float fleets in the UK. Most of the vehicles operate from the Grandtully Depot in Kelvindale. Some dairies in the UK, including Dairy Crest, have had to modernise and have replaced their electric milk floats with petrol or diesel fuel-powered vehicles to speed up deliveries and thus increase profit.

==Manufacturers==
There were many manufacturers of milk floats in Britain during the 20th century.

Brush Electrical Engineering Company had been established in 1889, and had manufactured electric cars between 1901 and 1905. In 1940, Brush required some small electric tractor units, but as none were commercially available, they asked AE Morrison and Sons to produce a design for one. Morrisons produced a 3-wheeled design, which Brush then used to manufacture a number of units for internal use. They then began selling them to customers, shipping a large order to Russia in 1941. They expanded to producing battery electric road vehicles in 1945, when they bought designs and manufacturing rights from Metrovick. The Metrovick designs were for 4-wheeled vehicles, but they also produced 3-wheeled vehicles, which were marketed as the Brush Pony. In early 1949, they reduced the prices of their electric vehicles by around 25 per cent, in an attempt to make them more competitive with petrol vehicles. All of their road vehicles were sold through the motor trade, in order to achieve a good standard of after-sales service. Production of 4-wheeled battery electrics ceased in 1950, although the company continued to manufacture the 3-wheeled Brush Pony, and their range of industrial trucks. By 1969, Brush were owned by the Hawker Siddeley group, which also owned half of Morrison-Electricars, and manufacture of Brush electric vehicles moved to the newly established Morrison factory at Tredegar. Most were industrial trucks, but the transfer also included the Brush Pony, and a number were manufactured at Tredegar subsequently.

Electricars began trading in Birmingham in 1919, and although they initially made heavy duty electric vehicles, suitable for payloads up to 6 tons, they soon diversified into smaller vehicles suitable for doorstep delivery. In 1936, they became part of the business group Associated Electric Vehicle Manufacturers Limited (AEVM), but during the Second World War, few electric vehicles were built, due to a shortage of materials, and they ceased producing them in 1944.

Graiseley Electric Vehicles were produced in Wolverhampton by Diamond Motors Ltd, a company which previously had made motorcycles, and which bought the sidecar business from AJS when that company was liquidated in 1931. Included in the sale was the Graiseley marque, and this was used for a range of three-wheeled battery-electric pedestrian controlled milk trucks. They soon found that they could sell into other industries as well. In 1937 they produced a ride-on four wheeled vehicle, suitable for a payload of . Nevertheless, it was for their pedestrian controlled vehicles that they were best known, and their range included the Model 60, the Model 75, and the Model 90. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried. Between 1948 and 1952, the company sold a large number of Graiseley PCVs to United Dairies, and gradually diversified into stillage trucks and pallet trucks for use in factories. The company was liquidated in 1960, but the Graiseley marque was used by Lister Graiseley in 1969 and by Gough Industrial Trucks Ltd of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent in 1971.

Harbilt electric vehicles were initially produced by the Market Harborough Construction Company, which was formed in 1935 as a manufacturer of aircraft components. After the end of the Second World War, they diversified, and electric vehicles were a part of their new product range. The first vehicle produced was the 551 pedestrian controlled vehicle, which they supplied with a charger made by Partridge Wilson of Leicester, who were making their own range of Wilson battery vehicles. As well as milk delivery, the chassis was popular in Switzerland, with some 2000 vehicles supplied to the Swiss Post Office and to Swiss hotels. From 1956, they introduced ride-on vehicles, beginning with the model 735, and expanded the range considerably over the next few years. At some point in the early 1970s, prior to 1974, Harbilt and Morrison-Electricars reached an agreement for a product exchange and rationalisation. All milk floats would be built by Morrisons at their Tredegar works, while Morrison trucks would be handed over to Harbilt. The electric vehicle facility was taken over by a management buyout in 1975, and registered as Harbilt Electric Trucks. It continued to make trucks for a variety of industries, until it was bought for almost twice its share value by Fred W Davies, a Canadian who owned the Davies Magnet Group and York Trailers, in 1987. Production moved to Corby, but the venture was short-lived, and it was sold again to M&amp;M Electric Vehicles of Atherstone in 1989.

Lewis Electruks were built by TH Lewis Ltd of Watford, a company closely associated with London&#x27;s Express Dairy Company. Lewis began building milk floats, milk carts and horse-drawn vehicles for Express Dairies in 1873, and the business became a limited company in 1899. It was taken over by Express in 1931, as part of a reorganisation of their business. TH Lewis designed two types of electric vehicle for Express, the first of which entered service in 1934. This was a 3-wheeled pedestrian controlled vehicle with a payload. They were one of the first companies to provide storage for dry goods on their vehicles, and demonstrated a type AER 4-wheeled float with a grocery box behind the cab at the 1955 Dairy Show. Their exhibits at the 1958 Dairy Show included a standard milk float with a walk-through cab and a vertical steering wheel. The company was acquired by Austin Crompton Parkinson, makers of Morrison Electricar floats, in 1961, and Morrisons continued to make two of their models, the Electruk Rider, which became the model E15, and a pedestrian controlled vehicle, which became the model DPC3. Both Express Dairies and the London Co-operative Society had large fleets of the Electruk Rider, and continued to add to them with purchases of the E15.

Metrovick electric vehicles were made by the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company between the 1930s and 1945. In 1939, the Metrovick range consisted of a model, a model and a model. By 1943, a model had been added to the range. A more modern design of cab had been introduced in 1939, and as the Second World War ended, Metrovick ceased to make battery electric road vehicles, selling its designs and manufacturing rights to Brush. Consequently, early Brush designs are virtually indistinguishable from later Metrovick designs.

Midland Electric milk floats were produced by Midland Vehicles Ltd of Leamington Spa. Their first design was a chassis, which was launched in January 1937. It was designed by J Parker Garner, who at the time was a well-known designer, having been involved in the manufacturing of vehicles for a number of years. In early 1938, Midland added a model B20 to their range, which was designed for a payload, but was otherwise very similar to the earlier model. It was showcased at the British Industries Fair, held at Castle Bromwich in February. By 1943, Midland Electric were producing five models, which could be fitted with various types of bodywork, including a flat-bed truck for coal deliveries. They produced a new lightweight design in 1949, which featured an all-welded chassis with an integral body frame. The company was listed in a 1956 directory of electric vehicle manufacturers published in Commercial Motor, but the company closed in 1957.

Morrison-Electricars had their origins in the 1890s in Leicester, when AE Morrison began producing bicycles, motorcycles and stationary engines. The company became AE Morrison and Sons in 1929, and produced their first battery electric vehicle in 1933. They moved to larger premises in 1935, and all other products were phased out. They were another major player in AEVM, and Electricars and Morrisons rationalised their product range, with Morrisons concentrating on the smaller vehicles suitable for milk delivery. The vehicles were marketed as Morrison-Electricars from mid-1942, and were so known despite a series of takeovers. The Austin Motor Company bought a 50 percent share in AEVM in 1948, and the company became Austin Crompton Parkinson Electric Vehicles Ltd. Austin merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1952, which in turn merged with Leyland Motors in 1969, to become British Leyland. The electric vehicle business became Crompton Leyland Electricars Ltd. In 1972, British Leyland sold their share of the business to Hawker Siddeley, better known for aircraft manufacture, and the company became Crompton Electricars Ltd. The Board of Trade refused to allow Morrisons to move to new premises in Leicester, because of a lack of skilled labour in the area, and instead offered to build them a new factory in a development area, so the manufacturing base moved to Tredegar, south Wales, in 1968. Morrison-Electricars ceased to be made in 1983, when Hawker Siddeley sold the business to M &amp; M Electric Vehicles of Atherstone, Warwickshire, who subsequently adopted the Electricars name for their own vehicles.

Victor Electrics was formed in 1923 when Outram&#x27;s Bakery in Southport, Merseyside, wanted to buy some electric vehicles to replace horses and carts on local deliveries, but found that both home-produced and imported vehicles were considerably more expensive than they were prepared to pay. They started manufacturing their own electric bread vans, which looked like conventional vans, with the batteries mounted under a bonnet at the front. They were soon making three models of bonneted van, but in 1931, produced a forward control vehicle with a walk-through cab for the dairy industry. By 1935, they had a range of forward control vehicles in production, and ceased to make bonneted vans. In 1967, the company was acquired by Brook Motors, and became part of Brook Victor Electric Vehicles. This company was itself acquired by Hawker Siddeley in 1970, and in 1973 it became Brook Crompton Parkinson Motors.

Wales &amp; Edwards was the name of a garage and car salesroom for Morris and Wolseley cars, based in Shrewsbury. Mervyn Morris designed an electric vehicle, and the first milk float was sold to Roddington Dairy in early 1951. A request from United Dairies saw the production of a 3-wheeled chain driven vehicle, which was an immediate success. An order for 1,500 vehicles followed, and a new manufacturing base was set up in Harlescott, a suburb to the north of Shrewsbury. Larger models followed, although the 3-wheeled design was retained for most of their subsequent output. Four-wheeled vehicles were introduced in 1966 for payloads which exceeded , although they made eighteen 5-wheeled articulated milk floats from 1961, which could carry . The company was acquired by Smith Electric Vehicles in 1989.

Wilson Electrics were made by Partridge Wilson Engineering, who were manufacturers of charging equipment for accumulators, and were based in Leicester. In 1934 they produced their first electric van, suitable for a payload of , and went on to produce several larger models, including a version. In 1939 they were offering special deals for fleets of six vehicles, which were charged using a Davenset 3-phase group charger. Wilson Electric vehicles ceased to be produced in 1954, although the company continued to trade in Leicester until 1986.
Other manufacturers included Smith&#x27;s, Osborne, and Bedford. In 1941, Morrison-Electricar standardised three types of body which would become the basis for thousands of milk floats built after the war to deliver goods to the recovering population. By 2003, there were still a number of companies offering doorstep deliveries, but no companies supplying new vehicles. Bluebird Automotive attempted to fill the gap, but only succeeded in supplying two vehicles to Golden Vale Dairies in Bridgend and one to Express Dairies, which was trialled in Northampton, before becoming insolvent in 2007.

==Alternatives==

Before BEVs, dairy supplies were delivered using horse-drawn milk floats. This lasted from the late 19th century until the 1950s. Today, with rounds expanding in coverage to ensure profitability in the face of falling levels of patronage, the limited range and speed of electric milk floats have resulted in many being replaced by diesel-powered converted vans.

==Preservation==

A collection of 29 milk floats and other BEVs dating from 1935 to 1982 and representing 14 different manufacturers is kept by The Transport Museum, Wythall at their museum, and an early Brush Pony, dating from 1947 and operated by United Dairies, can be seen at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. There are five battery-electric road vehicles in the collection at the Ipswich Transport Museum, including a Smiths milk float dating from 1948, which was operated by Ipswich Co-operative Society, a Smiths vegetable cart dating from 1965 and a Brush Pony van dating from 1967. In addition several milk floats are still in service today, albeit repurposed after their milk delivery days. Many are used for work in factories, or as pleasure vehicles in rural areas, and some are hired out.

<text>Joseph Emerson Brown (April 15, 1821 – November 30, 1894), often referred to as Joe Brown, was an American attorney and politician, serving as the 42nd Governor of Georgia from 1857 to 1865, the only governor to serve four terms. He also served as a United States Senator from that state from 1880 to 1891.

A former Whig, and a firm believer in slavery and Southern states&#x27; rights, Brown was a leading secessionist in 1861, and led his state into the Confederacy. Yet he also defied the Confederate government&#x27;s wartime policies: he resisted the military draft, believing that local troops should be used only for the defense of Georgia; and denounced Confederate President Jefferson Davis as an incipient tyrant, challenging Confederate impressment of animals and goods to supply the troops, and slaves to work in military encampments and on the lines. Several other governors followed his lead.

After the American Civil War, Brown joined the Republican Party for a time, and was appointed as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia from 1865 to 1870. Later he rejoined the Democrats, became president of the Western and Atlantic Railroad and began to amass great wealth; he was estimated to be a millionaire by 1880. He benefited from using convicts leased from state, county and local governments in his coal mining operations in Dade County. His Dade Coal Company bought other coal and iron companies, and by 1889 was known as the Georgia Mining, Manufacturing and Investment Company. Finally, he was twice elected by the state legislature as a U.S. Senator, serving from 1880 to 1891. During this time he was part of the Bourbon Triumvirate, alongside fellow prominent Georgia politicians John Brown Gordon and Alfred H. Colquitt.

Brown saved the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary financially in the 1870s. An endowed chair in his honor, the Joseph Emerson Brown Chair of Christian Theology, was established at the institution. In 2020, the endowed chair was vacated because of Brown&#x27;s position on slavery and use of the convict leasing system.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Emerson Brown was born on April 15, 1821, in Pickens County, South Carolina, to Mackey Brown and Sally (Rice) Brown. At a young age he moved with his family to Union County, Georgia. In 1840, he decided to leave the farm and seek an education. With the help of his younger brother James and their father&#x27;s plow horse, Brown drove a yoke of oxen on a 125-mile trek to an academy near Anderson, South Carolina. There Brown traded the oxen for eight months&#x27; board and lodging.

In 1844, Brown moved to Canton, Georgia, where he served as headmaster of the town&#x27;s academy. During this time, Brown boarded in the home of local businessman and Baptist minister John W. Lewis. Brown paid for his room and board by tutoring the Lewis children. A friendship developed between the men, and Lewis loaned Brown money to continue his legal education.

Brown went to Yale University to study law, then returned to Canton to practice. In 1847 he opened a law office in the county seat, and began to make the connections on which he built his fortune. He married Elizabeth Grisham, daughter of a major land developer. They had several children together.

Brown joined the Democratic Party and was soon elected to the Georgia state senate in 1849 from the developing Etowah River valley. He rapidly rose as a leader in the party. He was elected as state circuit court judge in 1855. He was a presidential elector in 1856.

==Governor of Georgia==
===First term===
In 1857, at the young age of 36, Brown was elected governor of the state. He supported free public education for poor white children, believing that it was key to development of the state. He asked the state legislature to divert a portion of profits from the state-owned railroad, the Western &amp; Atlantic, to help fund the schools. Most planters did not support public education and paid for private tutors and academies for their children. The Western and Atlantic Railroad was mismanaged, and unable to produce the income Brown required to fund his public education proposal. In 1858, Governor Brown appointed John W. Lewis, his landlord and benefactor from Brown&#x27;s early days in Canton, to the position of Superintendent of the state-owned railroad. Lewis was a successful businessman, and immediately undertook reforms to turn around the failing enterprise. The railroad, said to be in &quot;dire financial straits&quot;, required the same strict economic controls Lewis had practiced in his private businesses. In the three years that Lewis ran the railroad, he was able to turn the business into a money-making enterprise, paying $400,000 per year into the state treasury.

===Second term===
Brown easily won re-election in 1859 when he defeated a young Warren Akin Sr. (who was just beginning his political career) by a margin of 60%-40%.

Brown was a slave owner; in 1850, he owned five slaves. By 1860 when he was governor, he owned a total of 19 slaves and several farms in Cherokee County, Georgia.

Brown became a strong supporter of secession from the United States after Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election and South Carolina&#x27;s secession in 1860. He feared that Lincoln would abolish slavery. Considering it the basis of the South&#x27;s lucrative plantation economy, he called upon Georgians to oppose the efforts to end slavery:

Once the Confederacy was established, Brown, a states&#x27; rights advocate, spoke out against expansion of the Confederate central government&#x27;s powers. He denounced President Jefferson Davis in particular. Brown tried to stop Colonel Francis Bartow from taking Georgia troops &quot;out of the state&quot; to the First Battle of Bull Run. He objected most strenuously to military conscription by the Confederate government in Richmond, protested the army&#x27;s impressment of goods and slave labor, and was critical of Confederate tax and blockade-running policies. In time, other Confederate governors followed Brown&#x27;s example, undermining the war effort and sapping the Confederacy of vital resources.

===Third term===
In 1861, Brown was up for re-election to a third term. It was at this time, during the re-election campaign, that Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Superintendent John Wood Lewis, an old friend of the governor, decided to resign from the railroad. The timing could not have been worse. Fearing that Lewis&#x27; resignation would be interpreted negatively, the governor requested that Lewis keep the resignation a secret; but the resignation letter was leaked to the press, causing a rift between the two old friends. Brown wrote to Lewis, saying: &quot;I did not deserve this at your hands, and I confess I felt it keenly...I do not attribute improper motives, but only say the coincidence was an unfortunate one for me&quot;. The two friends eventually smoothed over the incident, and Governor Brown was subsequently re-elected. On April 7, 1862, months after Lewis left the railroad, Governor Brown appointed Lewis to a vacant seat in the Confederate Senate in the 1st Confederate States Congress, 1862–1863. Robert Toombs, former Confederate States Secretary of State, had created the vacancy when he declined his election at the Congress&#x27;s opening session on February 18.

==Capture of Milledgeville - the state capital==
In 1864, after the fall of Atlanta, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea. On the route from Atlanta to Savannah the left wing of Sherman&#x27;s army entered the city of Milledgeville, then Georgia&#x27;s state capital. As U.S. troops closed in on the city, and with the fall of the capital imminent, Governor Brown ordered Quartermaster General Ira Roe Foster to remove the state records. The task proved to be difficult, as it was undertaken in the midst of chaos.

After the loss of Atlanta, Brown withdrew the state&#x27;s militia from the Confederate forces to harvest crops for the state and the army. When Union troops under Sherman overran much of Georgia in 1864, Brown called for an end to the war.
==Post-war imprisonment to Republican judgeship==
After the war, Brown was briefly held as a prisoner in Washington, D.C. He supported President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s Reconstruction policies, joining the Republican Party for a time.

Brown was a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention. As a Republican, Brown was appointed as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia, serving from 1868 to 1870.

===Rejoining the Democratic Party===
Brown resigned as judge when offered the presidency of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. In this role, Brown opposed efforts by a committee to revise the state constitution to establish uniform rates for freight over the multiple railroad lines in the state.

After Reconstruction ended, Brown rejoined the Democratic Party. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1880 by the state legislature, as was custom by the US constitution and state laws of the time. Soon after his election to the Senate, Brown became the first Democratic Party official in Georgia to support public education for all white children. The Republican Reconstruction-era legislature was the first to establish public education in the state but the succeeding post-Reconstruction, white-dominated legislature abandoned it. Brown recommended that railroad fees be used to support it financially. Prior to this, only the elite who could afford tutors or private academies had their children formally educated.

==Later political service and business career==
Brown was first elected to the United States Senate by the state legislature in 1880, taking office on May 26, 1880. He was re-elected in 1885, and retired in 1891 due to poor health.

While Brown&#x27;s political supporters claimed that he &quot;came to Atlanta on foot with less than a dollar in his pocket after the war and ... made himself all that he is by honest and laborious methods&quot;, most of his enterprises stemmed from his political connections. He amassed a fortune, in part through the use of convicts leased from state, county and local government in his coal mining operations in Dade County. His use of leased convict labor began in 1874 and continued until his death in 1894, a period that coincided with &quot;the high tide of the convict lease system in Georgia&quot;.

The convict lease system was first authorized during the period of Reconstruction, under military governor and Union general Thomas H. Ruger, who issued the first convict lease in April 1868. It was expanded during the post-Reconstruction era, when the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed new laws criminalizing a range of behavior. State prisoners who were unable to pay fines, levied as part of their conviction, faced the possibility of being leased out by the state, as convict labor.

In 1880 Brown, whose fortune was estimated conservatively at one million dollars, netted $98,000 (~$ in ) from the Dade Coal Company. By 1886, Dade Coal was a parent company, owning Walker Iron and Coal, Rising Fawn Iron, Chattanooga Iron, and Rogers Railroad and Ore Banks, and leasing Castle Rock Coal Company. An 1889 reorganization resulted in the formation of the Georgia Mining, Manufacturing and Investment Company. This rested largely on a foundation of convict labor. The system has been likened by journalist Douglas A. Blackmon to &quot;slavery by another name,&quot; in his book by that title.

A legislative committee visited Brown&#x27;s mines during the same year that Brown sold them. They reported that the convict laborers were &quot;in the very worst condition ... actually being starved and have not sufficient clothing ... treated with great cruelty.&quot; Of particular note to the visiting officials was that the mine claimed to have replaced whipping with the water cure torture—in which water was poured into the nostrils and lungs of the prisoners—because it allowed miners to &quot;go to work right away&quot; after punishment. However, it was not established if these practices were in place at the time that Brown sold the mine, or were instituted by the mine&#x27;s new owner Joel Hurt.

==Death and legacy==

Joseph E. Brown died on November 30, 1894, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was honored by lying in state in the state capitol.

His tombstone is in Oakland Cemetery. In 1928, a memorial statue of Brown and his wife was installed on the grounds of the State Capitol.

His son, Joseph Mackey Brown, would also become governor of Georgia (twice).

Joseph E. Brown Hall on the campus of the University of Georgia in Athens is named in his honor. The building was completed in 1932.

Joseph Emerson Brown Park in Marietta, Georgia is named for him.

Emerson, Georgia, referencing the governor&#x27;s middle name, is named in his honor.

==In fiction==
In her novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Margaret Mitchell made reference to Governor Brown, and the reception that &quot;Joe Brown&#x27;s Pets&quot; received during General Sherman&#x27;s march through Georgia in 1864. Brown had tried to keep Georgia troops in the state for local defense. Mitchell wrote:

<doc id="531775" wikidata="Q16823055" url="?curid=531775" title="New Democratic Party leadership elections">
<text>New Democratic Party leadership elections, more commonly known as leadership conventions, are the process by which the Canadian New Democratic Party elects its leader.

Before 2003, when a modified one member, one vote (OMOV) system was adopted, every biennial New Democratic Party convention, since 1961, was a leadership convention. However, in practice, contested elections were held only when there was a declared leadership race. The earliest example of an incumbent leader being challenged from the convention floor happened in 1973 when Douglas Campbell unsuccessfully opposed David Lewis&#x27; leadership. In 2001, NDP Socialist Caucus member Marcel Hatch challenged Alexa McDonough from the floor of the convention; however, McDonough easily retained the leadership in the resulting vote.

When the NDP was created by the merger of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), trade unions were allowed to directly affiliate to the party, and a system was unofficially arranged so that up to one-third of all delegates to NDP conventions were selected by labour and the other two-thirds by NDP riding associations. This was also the case at leadership conventions, giving the labour movement a significant say in determining the party&#x27;s leadership. Under the current system, each biennial federal convention includes a vote at which the delegates decide whether a leadership convention should be held. Then-leader Thomas Mulcair lost such a vote at the 2016 convention, resulting in the 2017 leadership election being called.

In practice, all three CCF leaders had been chosen by their parliamentary caucus and then elected unanimously at a subsequent national convention.

==1961 leadership convention results==

Held in Ottawa, Ontario on August 3, 1961.

==1971 leadership convention results==

Held in Ottawa, Ontario on April 24, 1971.

==1973 leadership challenge results==
&quot;Held in Vancouver, British Columbia on Friday, July 20, 1973.&quot;

==1975 leadership convention results==

Held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on July 7, 1975.

==1989 leadership convention results==

Held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on December 2, 1989.

==1995 leadership convention results==

Held in Ottawa, Ontario on October 14, 1995.

The NDP held a series of regional and labour &quot;caucus votes&quot; prior to the national convention. A fourth candidate, Herschel Hardin, participated in the regional caucuses but did not win sufficient delegate support to qualify for the convention. These &quot;primaries&quot; were OMOV.

As the last place finisher on the first ballot, Nystrom was dropped. However, Robinson determined that he could not win on the second ballot if Nystrom&#x27;s supporters moved to McDonough, as they were expected to, thus he withdrew and McDonough was declared the winner.

==2001 leadership challenge results==
Held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on Sunday, November 25, 2001.

Marcel Hatch, a leader of the NDP&#x27;s Socialist Caucus, stood for leader as a challenge to Alexa McDonough&#x27;s leadership.
&quot;There were 42 spoiled ballots. If these are factored in McDonough&#x27;s level of support was 78% overall.&quot;

==2003 leadership election results==

Held in Toronto, Ontario on January 25, 2003.

For this election, the NDP instituted a modified one member one vote system. Votes by labour delegates accounted for 25% of the total result, while votes cast by party members accounted for 75%. The carve out for labour was eliminated prior to the 2012 election.

==2012 leadership election==

The leadership convention was held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on March 24, 2012. There were 128,351 eligible voters, most voting from home and not delegates at the convention.

The party chose Thomas Mulcair as their new leader following the death of Jack Layton on August 22, 2011. A One member, one vote process was used.

: = Eliminated from next round
: = Withdrew nomination
: = Winner

==2017 leadership election==

Voting was held between September 18 to October 1, 2017. The results were announced on October 1 in Toronto, Ontario at the Westin Harbour Castle.

*Spoiled ballots: 101
*Abstentions: 172
*Turnout: 52.8% (1.9pp)

<text>Charles Wilson (April 1808 – May 4, 1877) was a Canadian businessman and politician.

==Background==
Wilson was born at Coteau-du-Lac, Quebec, in 1808. He was the son of Alexander Wilson (b.1758), a native of Huntly, Aberdeenshire, who came to Quebec City where he was a merchant, magistrate and later Seigneur of Granville. Wilson&#x27;s mother, Catherine-Angélique d&#x27;Ailleboust de Manthet (1781-1845), was the daughter of Nicholas d&#x27;Ailleboust des Musseaux de Manthet (1747-1826), descended from Louis d&#x27;Ailleboust de Coulonge, 4th Governor of New France.

Wilson established a hardware business, and became a prosperous and respected merchant near the Montreal waterfront. In 1835, he married Ann Tracey, sister of Daniel Tracey.

==Montreal city politics==
He served as a City Councillor of Montreal from 1848 to 1849 and from 1850 to 1852 and Mayor of Montreal from 1851 to 1854.

Protestant journalists such as John Dougall of the Montreal Witness persisted in accusing the mayor for the Gavazzi Riots. When in September 1855, at Ignace Bourget&#x27;s request, Wilson received the cross of commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great from Pope Pius IX, the Protestant press resumed its accusations against the man responsible for the &quot;St Bartholomew of Montreal.&quot;

==Member of the upper house==
In 1852, he became a member of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada and, following the creation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada in the new nation&#x27;s capital Ottawa as a Conservative party representative for the riding of Rigaud.

==Death==
Charles Wilson is interred in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. He is commemorated by both Wilson Avenue in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and by rue Charles-Wilson in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

<text>AMSAT is a name for various amateur radio satellite organizations worldwide. In particular, it often refers to the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation, headquartered in Washington, D.C. AMSAT organizations design, build, arrange launches for, and then operate (command) satellites carrying amateur radio payloads, including the OSCAR series of satellites. Other informally affiliated national organizations exist, such as AMSAT Germany (AMSAT-DL) and AMSAT Japan (JAMSAT).

== History ==
AMSAT was founded in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to continue the efforts begun by Project OSCAR. Its first project was to coordinate the launch of OSCAR 5, constructed by students at the University of Melbourne. Some design modifications were needed and were made by AMSAT members, and the satellite was successfully launched on 30 January 1970, on a NASA Thor Delta launch vehicle.

AMSAT&#x27;s next launch was AMSAT-OSCAR 6 (AO-6) on 15 October 1972. AO-6 was AMSAT&#x27;s first long-life satellite, and was built with participants from Australia and West Germany. Command stations in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Hungary, Morocco, New Zealand, the United States and West Germany controlled the satellite, contributing greatly to its 4.5 years of service. Further launches continued to emphasize international cooperation, with AMSAT-OSCAR 7 (AO-7) launching with a new transponder developed and built by Karl Meinzer and AMSAT Germany (AMSAT-DL). AMSAT Japan (JAMSAT) contributed a transponder to AMSAT-OSCAR 8 (AO-8).

In order to launch its satellites, AMSAT has worked with space agencies and commercial launch contractors to develop new ways to take advantage of unused areas of launch vehicles. In return, AMSAT sometimes can negotiate a reduction or waiver of launch costs. One of the most significant is the Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP), developed and manufactured in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1990 for use on its Ariane 4 launch vehicle. AMSAT was again able to take advantage of unused space with the launch of AMSAT-OSCAR 40 (AO-40), occupying unused space on an Ariane 5.

=== IPS ===
The IPS (Interpreter for Process Structures) programming language was specifically written for the RCA 1802 AMSAT Phase III satellite.

The IPS threaded code language, developed for AMSAT Phase III, is the first known use of a high-level language on board a spacecraft.

Another 16-bit IPS implementation was specifically developed to run on the ARM CPU in the IHU-2 on the AMSAT P3D.

A 32-bit IPS implementation has been developed for the AMSAT P3E satellite and the AMSAT P5A mission to Mars, which also have ARM CPUs. Emulators for both the classic 16-bit and the 32-bit IPS language and development environment are available for many other systems.

== AMSAT organizations worldwide ==

From its first launch, AMSAT projects have had international scope. By 2006, 21 countries had launched an amateur satellite. Many of these countries have their own AMSAT affiliate, some of which are noted below:

* AMSAT Germany (AMSAT-DL, AMSAT Deutschland) has built and managed projects of several amateur radio satellites, notably AO-40.
* AMSAT Japan (JAMSAT) has contributed to many satellites, in addition to launching its own satellites in cooperation with JAXA: the Fuji-OSCAR series.
* AMSAT India (AMSAT-IN) launched its first amateur satellite, VUSat-OSCAR 52 in 2005 aboard an Indian Space Research Organisation PSLV launch vehicle from Sriharikota, India.
* AMSAT United Kingdom (AMSAT-UK) built FUNcube AO-73 with AMSAT-NL, an Amateur CubeSat that was launched as part of a Russian Dnepr payload in November 2013.
* AMSAT Italia (AMSAT-I) has built the HAMVIDEO TV transmitter for International Space Station and IO-117 (Italy-Oscar 117) first amateur radio satellite in MEO orbit.
* AMSAT-CT is NGO for Education and Development is Portuguese VIP member of AMSAT-DL, funded by Aerospace Observatory in 1998
* AMSAT-CT develop the prototype of the satellite CAMOESat-1 at Oeiras Aerospace Observatory facilities
* AMSAT-NL Netherlands
* AMSAT Brazil
* AMSAT Philippines (AMSAT-PH), club call sign DX1O, Diwata-2 satellite is designated Philippines-OSCAR 101 (PO-101) and has the amateur call sign DW4TA.
*AMSAT Spain (AMSAT EA), designed and built the radio-amateur satellites GENESIS-L, GENESIS-N, EASAT-2 and HADES, all of them pocketQubes.
*AMSAT New Zealand (AMSAT-ZL) developed kiwiSAT, intended to be New Zealand&#x27;s first satellite. It designed and built by New Zealand radio amateurs supported by Massey University (Auckland) and various corporate sponsors. The project began in 2003, but encountered many delays and setbacks, and was eventually dissolved in 2023.

== Phase system ==
The AMSAT Phase system describes an amateur satellite based upon its capabilities or mode of operation and roughly parallel the development of amateur satellites.

* Phase 1: No solar cells (battery-powered only), short-lived, technology test-bed. Must be able to orbit to be classified as a satellite.
* Phase 2: Long life using solar cells, communications capabilities, Low Earth Orbit.
* Phase 3: Long life, more powerful communications, telemetry and command systems. Highly elliptical orbit, usually a Molniya orbit; usually the initial orbit is a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), onboard propulsion systems boosting it to its final orbit. Because of the highly elliptical orbit, the satellite remains over an area for long periods of time, allowing amateurs longer contacts through the satellite.
* Phase 4: Amateur satellite in geostationary orbit (GEO). Currently, the only amateur radio transponders in orbit are a secondary mission aboard Es&#x27;hail 2, designated as QO-100 by AMSAT on 26 February 2019.
* Phase 5: Spacecraft capable of lunar or planetary missions.

== Satellite names ==
Most amateur satellites do not receive their sequential OSCAR designation until after they are successfully in orbit, and then only at the request of the launching organization. Regardless, amateur satellites will have been named by the organization that constructed it, and that name is frequently prepended to its OSCAR designation, resulting a name such as CubeSat-OSCAR 57. In conversation, names are usually abbreviated as CO-57 or similar.

A unique amateur satellite was SuitSat, an obsolete Russian space suit with a transmitter in it, which was launched in 2006 from the International Space Station. In a twist of fate, &quot;Oscar&quot; was the name given to an obsolete space suit by its young owner in the 1958 novel &quot;Have Space Suit, Will Travel&quot;, by Robert A Heinlein. This book was originally published a year after the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1.

== Satellites previously launched by AMSAT ==
The names of the satellites below are sorted in chronological order by launch date, ascending. The status column denotes the current operational status of the satellite.
 Green signifies that the satellite is currently operational, orange indicates that the satellite is partially operational or failing. Red indicates that the satellite is non operational and black indicates that the satellite has re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The &quot;country&quot; listing denotes the country that constructed the satellite and not the launching country.
== Current projects ==
AMSAT built a series of five 1U CubeSats to carry university experiments, including a camera, and mode U/V FM repeaters. The first two of these satellites, Fox-1A, and Fox-1B, were launched on 8 October 2015 and 18 November 2017 respectively and are currently operational and available for use. Fox-1D (AO-92) was launched on 12 January 2018 on the PSLV-C40 mission from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. Fox-1Cliff was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard the SpaceX Falcon-9 SSO-A rocket on 3 December 2018. These four Fox satellites contain FM transponders with uplink on the 70 cm band and downlink on the 2 metre band.

RadFxSat-2/Fox-1E, a variation of the Fox-1 series, carrying a mode V/U linear transponder has been accepted for a launch by the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative. Fox-1E was launched into orbit aboard a Virgin Orbit LauncherOne vehicle on 17 January 2021. Although the beacon has not been heard, the linear transponder is at least partially functioning with a low level downlink signal.

AMSAT is currently developing the GOLF series of CubeSats with the first satellite in the series, GOLF-TEE, expected to launch in 2022. The GOLF series is designed to test technologies for future high Earth orbit (HEO) missions.

AMSAT also offers a communications platform for university CubeSats. The AMSAT Linear Transponder Module (LTM) includes a VHF/UHF telemetry beacon, command receiver, and linear transponder. The first LTM flew on HuskySat-OSCAR 107 in 2020. In July 2020, AMSAT and the University of Maine announced that an LTM would be provided for the University of Maine&#x27;s MESAT1 CubeSat, Maine&#x27;s first small satellite.

Additionally, AMSAT supports amateur radio on human spaceflight missions as a supporting partner of Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS). This partnership includes support for future missions on the Lunar Gateway.

AMSAT also supports STEM education and has developed a CubeSat Simulator as part of these efforts.

== Currently operating missions ==
AMSAT operates the AO-7, AO-91, and AO-92 satellites, which are open for general amateur use. The U.S. Air Force FalconSAT-3 was turned over to AMSAT for amateur radio use in late September 2017. AO-95 was launched aboard SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon-9 SSO-A mission on 4 December 2018 and was later determined to have poor to no RF reception capability, thus preventing commissioning and putting its FM transponder mission into indefinite suspension.

<text>Lucyan David Mech (; born January 18, 1937), also known as Dave Mech, is an American biologist specializing in the study of wolves. He is a senior research scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey and an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota. He has researched wolves since 1958 in locations including northern Minnesota, Isle Royale, Alaska, Yellowstone National Park, Ellesmere Island, and Italy.

Mech is the founder of the International Wolf Center and the vice-chair of its board of directors. The project to create the facility, which he started in 1985, was an outgrowth of his wolf research as well as his ambition to educate people about the nature of wolves, so that they may come to respect the creature through understanding.

He has published eleven books about wolves and other wildlife, including &quot;The Wolf: The Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species&quot; (1970) and &quot;Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation&quot;, which he co-edited with Luigi Boitani (2003). His 1997 book &quot;The Arctic Wolf: Ten Years with the Pack&quot; received an honorable mention by the National Outdoor Book Award (Nature and the Environment category). His latest book, with Doug Smith and Dan MacNulty, is &quot;Wolves on the Hunt: the Behavior of Wolves Hunting Wild Prey&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Mech was born in Auburn, New York, on January 18, 1937, and raised in Syracuse. He obtained a B.S. degree in conservation from Cornell University in 1958 and a Ph.D. in wildlife ecology from Purdue University in 1962.

From 1958 to 1962, Mech was a graduate student at Purdue, studying the wolves of Isle Royale, on Lake Superior, beginning in 1958. His first book was &quot;The Wolves of Isle Royale&quot;, published in 1966 by the Department of the Interior, having evolved from his doctoral thesis. In 1966, he studied wolves in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota.

==Career and research==
Beginning in 1986, Mech spent 25 summers observing wolves on Ellesmere Island. He said that his research on the wolves there was different, because it is one of the few places where they are not afraid of people, making that experience one of the best in his life. In addition, there were no trees or bushes to hide wolves from view in the tundra. In the summer, Mech found a den near the military and weather base at Eureka. He witnessed wolf interactions within a family unit and watched them hunting muskoxen; this type of research had not been done before. In an interview, Mech said, &quot;The kind of stuff I got here was not just the objective behavioral stuff, but the kind of thing you get from living with a pet of some sort. You get an insight into the thing. You get to know the animal.&quot; Mech and photographer Jim Brandenburg together produced several articles and a film for National Geographic. The Ellesmere research concentrated on observing the interactions of pack members with each other and with pups around a den. The study also encompassed wolf interactions with muskoxen and arctic hares and wolf movements throughout the year using GPS collars.

Mech&#x27;s research involves monitoring wolf–deer relations in the Superior National Forest of Minnesota, examining relations between the two populations as well as the effects of snow conditions and canine parvovirus on that system. He has also conducted research in Denali National Park, Alaska; Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada; and in Yellowstone National Park. The Denali work involved studying the interactions between wolves and caribou, moose, and Dall sheep. The Yellowstone National Park studies concentrated primarily on wolf interactions with prey, including mortality and survival studies of elk.

Mech serves as a senior research scientist for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) since 1999, and prior to that, he was a wildlife research biologist in the Biological Resources Division of the USGS, from 1969 to 1999.

An avid mushroom hunter and fur trapper, Mech has continued to support fishing, hunting, and trapping, which has led to criticism from animal protectionists. He believes that states can manage wolves sustainably and that states where wolves are no longer on the endangered list should determine how the animal should be managed. On his website, he lists mink trapping as one of his interests. He closed the abstract to &quot;Is science in danger of sanctifying the wolf?&quot;, published in the January 2012 issue of &quot;Biological Conservation&quot;, with &quot;The wolf is neither a saint nor a sinner except to those who want to make it so.&quot;

Mech was actively involved in the reintroduction of gray wolves to areas from which they had disappeared through human activities. After more than 45 years of population recovery, in 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service removed the gray wolf from the list of endangered species. The Mexican and Red wolves remain on the list, however.

Mech has also written about wolf management through regulation. According to him, every year, a certain percentage of a wolf population must be killed by humans (in addition to natural mortality) to keep the population stable. According to his findings, about 50% of young wolves over 5–10 months old must be killed each year to bring a wolf population under control. In a 2017 publication, he describes, among other things, livestock-depredation control in the United States.

Mech has declined to express an opinion on whether wolves should be hunted or trapped for their pelts, saying that his opinion on the subject is no better than that of anybody else.

==Publications==
Mech has published approximately 380 scientific papers and 100 popular articles about wolves and other wildlife. He has written eleven books. These include &quot;The Wolf: The Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species&quot; (1970), &quot;Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation&quot;, which he co-edited with Luigi Boitani (2003), and &quot;Wolves on the Hunt: The Behavior of Wolves Hunting Wild Prey&quot; (2015), with Doug Smith and Dan MacNulty. His 1997 book, &quot;The Arctic Wolf: Ten Years with the Pack&quot;, received an honorable mention by the National Outdoor Book Award (Nature and the Environment category). The International Wolf Center lists approximately 140 articles written by Mech, published from 1987 to the present, primarily in scientific journals.

==Awards==
In 2005, Purdue University conferred upon Mech an additional honorary degree, with the statement: &quot;Mech&#x27;s long-term studies of the wolf and other wild vertebrates have resulted in nearly 400 scientific, semi-technical and popular publications or articles. His scholarly contributions have expanded the understanding of wolf ecology more than any other individual. No one has written about, spoken of or debated the status and future of the wolf more than him. He has contributed to virtually every wolf conservation effort that the planet has seen in recent decades. In recognition of his accomplishments, Mech was awarded the Wildlife Society&#x27;s highest honor in 1993, the Aldo Leopold Award. Purdue previously honored him as recipient of the Distinguished Agricultural Alumni Award in 1995 and the Distinguished Undergraduate Research Award in 2000&quot;.

<doc id="531796" wikidata="Q746512" url="?curid=531796" title="You Are the Quarry">
<text>You Are the Quarry is the seventh solo studio album by English singer-songwriter Morrissey. It was released on 17 May 2004 by record label Attack, and was his first album in seven years following 1997&#x27;s &quot;Maladjusted&quot;. The album was a huge comeback for Morrissey; all four of its singles reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, and the album itself reached number 2. The album also reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Morrissey&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States.

== Reception ==
According to critic review aggregator Metacritic, the album received an average review score of 72/100, based on 31 critical reviews, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Release==

The first single released to promote the album was &quot;Irish Blood, English Heart&quot;, released on 10 May 2004. &quot;You Are the Quarry&quot; was released on 17 May 2004 by record label Attack. The album charted at number 2 in the UK.

Some versions of the packaging do not show the full frame on the cover, but only a crop of Morrissey&#x27;s face, cropping out the machine gun.

Nancy Sinatra recorded a version of &quot;Let Me Kiss You&quot;, which was released as a single which performed well on the UK Singles Chart, prior to Morrissey&#x27;s own single release of the song.

In October 2004, Attack repackaged and reissued &quot;You Are the Quarry&quot; as a two-disc deluxe edition. The second disc collected the nine B-sides from the album&#x27;s first three singles, as well as music videos and live TV performances from the record, including Morrissey&#x27;s live performances on American TV show &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;. The original album is available with the bonus DVD, featuring the &quot;Irish Blood, English Heart&quot; video, song lyrics and a photo gallery.

== 20th Anniversary Concerts ==
Morrissey was set to perform the album in its entirety at two concerts in Southern California to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The concerts were scheduled for 26 January 2024 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, and 27 January 2024 at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles. The shows were ultimately cancelled when Morrissey was ordered to remain in Zurich Switzerland while suffering from physical exhaustion.

<text>The International Wolf Center (IWC) is a research and educational organization based near Ely, Minnesota, United States focused on wolves and their ecology. The Wolf Center operates an interpretive center in Ely open to the public, where visitors can view captive &quot;ambassador wolves&quot; in natural surroundings through large windows, and can learn about wolves through a variety of exhibits and programs. This organization lies within Superior National Forest. It also sponsors research symposia and offsite educational programs, publishes &quot;International Wolf&quot; magazine, and provides information about wolves via its website.

In response to wolf controversies, the Wolf Center does not take a stand on how wolves should be managed (such as by hunting or trapping), as long as healthy wolf populations are maintained. Its policy is to provide the most accurate, up-to-date information possible about wolves and let people make their own decisions.

==Exhibits and activities==
Founded in 1985 by a group of biologists led by wolf biologist Dr. L. David Mech, the International Wolf Center opened in June 1993. The Wolf Center is housed in a facility near Ely, Minnesota and features Gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) viewable through large windows that allow visitors to watch the wolves communicate, hunt, eat and play. Visitors have the opportunity to view a enclosure that is home to an Exhibit Pack of ambassador wolves, representing several North American subspecies, including Arctic, Northwestern, and Great Plains. The Center introduces new wolf pups every four years. 
In addition to the on-site wolves, the Center offers various educational programs at its Ely interpretive facility, as well as wolf hot spots in northern Minnesota. Afternoon, weekend and week-long programs include howling trips, snowshoe treks, radio tracking, family activities, dog sledding, videos, presentations, demonstrations and hikes. The Center also houses a new &quot;Discover Wolves!&quot; exhibit, the &quot;Little Wolf&quot; exhibit designed specifically for children ages three to nine, a theater for watching documentaries on a variety of wolf-related topics, and a &quot;Wolf Den&quot; store.

&quot;International Wolf&quot; magazine is published quarterly by the International Wolf Center. The publication is free to members of the International Wolf Center, and selected articles from each issue are available online.

To help accomplish its mission, the International Wolf Center provides a support program for educators, including distance learning opportunities as part of the &quot;WolfLink&quot; initiative that brings the center into hundreds of classrooms each year.

The center sponsored a video game called &quot;WolfQuest&quot;, which has been developed by the Minnesota Zoo. &quot;WolfQuest&quot; is an educational computer game that is intended to teach children and teens about the life of a wild wolf in Yellowstone National Park. Two episodes have been released thus far; &quot;WolfQuest: Amethyst Mountain&quot;, and &quot;WolfQuest: Slough Creek&quot;.

<text>William David Charles Carling (born 12 December 1965) is an English former rugby union player. He was England&#x27;s youngest captain, aged 22, and won 72 caps from 1988 to 1996, captaining England 59 times. Under his captaincy, England won Five Nations Grand Slam in 1991, 1992 and 1995, and reached the 1991 World Cup final.

He played for Rosslyn Park and Harlequins at club level. In the 1992 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

Since retiring, Carling has pursued interests including corporate speaking and punditry. In 2018 he joined the England coaching staff of Eddie Jones as a leadership mentor.

==Early life==
The son of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Carling, an officer in the Royal Regiment of Wales, Carling was born in Bradford-on-Avon and educated at Terra Nova School in Cheshire and then Sedbergh School, on an army scholarship. He disliked being sent to prep school but showed an aptitude for rugby and played above his age group, arriving at Sedbergh – a &quot;big rugby school&quot; – with a reputation as a serious talent.

On 2 April 1983 he made his debut for England Schools in a 16–0 victory over Ireland. He narrowly missed out on a junior Grand Slam, with an England Schools side that included Kevin Simms, Victor Ubogu and Carling&#x27;s future Durham and Harlequins teammate Andy Mullins, losing 13–12 to Wales.

===University===
Having decided for a career in the British Army like his father, Carling – after a gap year – took an in-service degree in Psychology at Durham University. This meant the &quot;occasional weekend exercise&quot;, but otherwise military activities were rather limited. He was an undergraduate student at Hatfield College, Durham (which had built a strong sporting reputation post-war), and was reunited with Mullins. Carling did not enjoy the transition from school to university rugby, and claimed to have &quot;stagnated&quot; in terms of development. Playing his first year at fullback, he had to accept a style of rugby that offered less creative freedom than he was used to.

Carling strongly considered giving up rugby after failing to enjoy his first year on the pitch at Durham, but found himself rejuvenated during an old boys&#x27; match at Sedbergh; and this reignited a desire to succeed in the sport. By his own admission he did not take his studies seriously and was often absent for lectures. He left with an ordinary pass degree in 1988. In January that year, Carling, still an undergraduate, made his debut for England against at the Parc des Princes. In May he was invited to tour with England abroad, but the start date clashed with his final exams. Consequently, he took his exams two days early, and to safeguard examination security, was driven straight to Newcastle Airport.

Despite a less than stellar academic record, Carling had the opportunity to continue his education at the University of Cambridge and represent Cambridge University R.U.F.C., who had already recruited his Durham colleague Chris Oti. However, Carling did not follow up the invitation, believing it would be unethical to accept a place he had not earned.

==Career==
===Early career, 1987–1991===
The England rugby team were in a period of transition following failure at the 1987 Rugby World Cup. There was a new manager, Geoff Cooke, and a new coach, Roger Uttley, replacing Mike Weston and Martin Green. England&#x27;s recent record was one of considerable underachievement, described by one writer as a &quot;sprawling desert of failure, stretching back as far as 1963&quot; — they had only won a single Five Nations Championship since then, in 1980. The new season offered good prospects for younger players, as league rugby was introduced for the first time, establishing a &quot;proper system which rewarded progress&quot;; Divisional Championships, which brought the best club players into regional teams, would not necessarily be the main method of selection in future.

In February 1987 Carling made his debut for Harlequins against Metropolitan Police. He soon played for England B in a 22–9 win over France B. Carling sensed he had a chance of earning his first senior England cap when Kevin Simms, a former England Schoolboys teammate, was selected to play against Romania. As Carling knew the strengths and weaknesses of Simms and &quot;wasn&#x27;t in awe of him&quot;, expectation that he might match this achievement grew.

Around Christmas 1987 Carling took part in an England trial for the upcoming Five Nations Championship. Initially he and Simms were set to be part of a junior team set to test more experienced &quot;probables&quot; including Simon Halliday of Bath and John Buckton of Saracens; but both Halliday and Buckton pulled hamstrings, which saw Carling and Simms &quot;bumped up&quot;. The team list was officially published the following Monday, and after some uncertainty, Carling realised he&#x27;d earned his first callup when a university friend phoned to congratulate him. His debut against France on 16 January was a defeat, with England losing 10-9 in Paris due to a late French score. Later comparing the atmosphere in the dressing room afterwards to a &quot;morgue&quot;, Carling was nonetheless pleased with his own performance. Carling started the remaining games against Wales, Scotland and Ireland, with England winning the latter two to finish third in that years Five Nations Championship.

Though still expected to pursue a military career, Carling abandoned these plans. He has stated that, contrary to media suggestions, he was never &quot;fully commissioned&quot;. By Carling&#x27;s own account, he was due to attend Sandhurst for the full officer training course in August 1988, but his status as an England international meant the army would not be able to accommodate his rugby ambitions. As a result, Carling opted to &quot;buy himself out&quot; of the army for £8,000. As rugby was an amateur game at this point, he accepted an executive post with Mobil Oil to make ends meet.

===1991–1995===
Under Carling England started to challenge and beat the established rugby union powers such as New Zealand and Australia, and their success helped to make rugby union a more popular sport in England. English victories over New Zealand and South Africa in 1993 were perhaps the peak of England&#x27;s performance under Carling.

Carling&#x27;s career included the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand. He underachieved on that tour, a pattern attributed by coach Ian McGeechan and manager Geoff Cooke as at least partly due to his failing to secure the captaincy (this instead going to Gavin Hastings of Scotland) but also due in large part to the ascendency in the centre of both Jeremy Guscott and Scott Gibbs of Wales. McGeechan and Cooke disclosed that Carling came close to voluntarily withdrawing from the squad; he did however recover his test place and played a notable role in the third test. McGeechan commented in his autobiography that Carling&#x27;s failure to rise to the occasion as a Lion (in contrast to Guscott) may be seen by some as the difference between his legacy as a good player and a great player.

Also in 1993, he became the second captain after John Pullin to lead and beat all of the “Big Three” Southern Hemisphere sides: , and , after beating the All Blacks 15–9. He had earlier led England to wins against Australia in November 1988, and South Africa in November 1992. As captain, he had 2 wins against Australia, 1 against New Zealand, and 2 against South Africa.

===1995 World Cup===
In the run-up to the 1995 World Cup, after England returned to form with their third Grand Slam in five years, Carling described the Rugby Football Union general committee as &quot;57 old farts&quot; which led to his sacking as captain. The incident had been provoked by administrator Dudley Wood&#x27;s comments about England players&#x27; alleged desire to cheat by breaking the amateur ethic. He was however quickly reinstated due to public pressure and following a public apology was able to go to the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After a slow start, England found form and subsequently won all their group games knocking out Australia in the quarter-final 25–22, thanks to a last-minute drop-goal from Rob Andrew. They were well beaten by New Zealand in the semi-final, largely thanks to four tries from Jonah Lomu. Although Carling himself scored two tries towards the end of that game, and set up two more for Rory Underwood, England lost 45–29. The subsequent loss in the third place play-off, against France, was England&#x27;s first loss to the French in seven years.

Following his resignation from the England captaincy, he continued to be selected as an outside centre, usually with Guscott or Phil de Glanville; the latter succeeded him as captain.

==Life after rugby==
After his rugby career ended he became a TV pundit on rugby union. He has also worked as a motivational speaker and in 2001 founded Will Carling Management Ltd, a corporate hospitality company which is also involved in the rugby social networking website &#x27;Rucku&#x27;.

George Gregan, an Australian player, equalled Carling&#x27;s then world record 59 matches as captain in the 2007 Rugby World Cup against Fiji. In the 2009 Tri Nations Series, Springbok John Smit also equalled and then beat Carling&#x27;s record in tests between New Zealand in Bloemfontein, and Durban respectively. Brian O&#x27;Driscoll Ireland/Lions 2009 and 2010, and Richie McCaw broke his record in 2011.

==Personal life==
Carling is married to his second wife Lisa, the ex-wife of David Cooke. The couple have two children. Carling has an older son with former partner Ali Cockayne. Carling was previously married to the television presenter Julia Carling (née Smith) from 1994 to 1996. Prior to their divorce, he was romantically linked by some members of the press with Diana, Princess of Wales, the then-wife of Prince Charles. Carling has denied any such relationship.

Carling, whose mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when he was an infant and later died from the disease, is a patron of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer.

==Politics==
In August 2014, Carling was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<text>Nima Yooshij or Nimā Yushij (11 November 1895 – 6 January 1960; ), also called Nimā (), born Ali Esfandiari (), was a prominent Iranian poet. He is famous for his style of poetry which he popularized, called &quot;she&#x27;r-e now&quot; (, lit. &quot;new poetry&quot;), also known as &quot;She&#x27;r-e Nimaa&#x27;i&quot; (, lit &quot;Nima poetry&quot;) in his honour after his death. He is considered the father of modern Persian poetry.

He died of pneumonia in Shemiran, northern Tehran. Following his will, he was buried in his native village of Yush, Nur County, Mazandaran.

== Early life ==
He was the eldest son of Ibrahim Nuri of Yush (a village in Baladeh, Nur County, Mazandaran province). He was a Tabarian, but also had Georgian roots on his maternal side. He grew up in Yush, mostly helping his father with the farm and taking care of the cattle. As a boy, he visited many local summer and winter camps and mingled with shepherds and itinerant workers. Images of life around the campfire, especially those emerging from the shepherds&#x27; simple and entertaining stories about village and tribal conflicts, impressed him greatly. These images, etched in the young poet&#x27;s memory waited until his power of diction developed sufficiently to release them.
Nima&#x27;s early education took place in a &quot;maktab&quot;. He was a truant student and the mullah (teacher) often had to seek him out in the streets, drag him to school, and punish him. At the age of twelve, Nima was taken to Tehran and registered at the &quot;St. Louis School&quot;. The atmosphere at the Roman Catholic school did not change Nima&#x27;s ways, but the instructions of a thoughtful teacher did. Nezam Vafa, a major poet himself, took the budding poet under his wing and nurtured his poetic talent.

Instruction at the Catholic school was in direct contrast to instruction at the &quot;maktab&quot;. Similarly, living among the urban people was at variance with life among the tribal and rural peoples of the north. In addition, both these lifestyles differed greatly from the description of the lifestyle about which he read in his books or listened to in class. Although it did not change his attachment to tradition, the difference set fire to young Nima&#x27;s imagination. In other words, even though Nima continued to write poetry in the tradition of Saadi and Hafez for quite some time his expression was being affected gradually and steadily. Eventually, the impact of the new overpowered the tenacity of tradition and led Nima down a new path. Consequently, Nima began to replace the familiar devices that he felt were impeding the free flow of ideas with innovative, even though less familiar devices that enhanced a free flow of concepts. &quot;Ay Shab&quot; (O Night) and &quot;Afsaneh&quot; (Myth) belong to this transitional period in the poet&#x27;s life (1922).

== Contributions ==
In general, Nima reformed the rhythm and allowed the length of the line to be determined by the depth of the thought being expressed rather than by the conventional Persian meters that had dictated the length of a &quot;bayt&quot; (verse) since the early days of Persian poetry. Furthermore, he emphasized current issues, especially the nuances of oppression and suffering, at the expense of the beloved&#x27;s moon face or the ever-growing conflict between the lovers, the beloved, and the rival. In other words, Nima realized that while some readers were enthused by the charms of the lover and the coquettish ways of the beloved, the majority preferred heroes with whom they could identify. Nima actually wrote quite a few poems in the traditional Persian poetry style and as critiqued by Abdolali Dastgheib, showed his ability well. However, he felt the old ways limit his freedom to express his deep feelings or important issues faced by society. This led him to break free and create a whole new style for modern poetry.

Furthermore, Nima enhanced his images with personifications that were very different from the &quot;frozen&quot; imagery of the moon, the rose garden, and the tavern. His unconventional poetic diction took poetry out of the rituals of the court and placed it squarely among the masses. The natural speech of the masses necessarily added local color and flavor to his compositions. Lastly, and by far Nima&#x27;s most dramatic element was the application of symbolism. His use of symbols was different from the masters in that he based the structural integrity of his creations on the steady development of the symbols incorporated. In this sense, Nima&#x27;s poetry could be read as a dialogue among two or three symbolic references building up into a cohesive semantic unit. In the past only Hafez had attempted such creations in his Sufic ghazals. The basic device he employed, however, was thematic, rather than symbolic unity. Symbolism, although the avenue for the resolution of the most enigmatic of his ghazals, plays a secondary role in the structural makeup of the composition.455

== Works ==
The venues in which Nima published his works are noteworthy. In the early years when the press was controlled by the government, Nima&#x27;s poetry, deemed below the established norm, was not allowed publication. For this reason, many of Nima&#x27;s early poems did not reach the public until the late 1930s. After the forced abdication of Reza Shah, Nima became a member of the editorial board of the &quot;Music&quot; magazine. Working with Sadeq Hedayat, he published many of his poems in that magazine. Only on two occasions he published his works at his own expense: &quot;The Pale Story&quot; and &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Family.&quot;

The closing of &quot;Music&quot; coincided with the formation of the Tudeh Party and the appearance of a number of leftist publications. Radical in nature, Nima was attracted to the new papers and published many of his groundbreaking compositions in them.

Ahmad Zia Hashtroudy and Abolghasem Jannati Ataei are among the first scholars to have worked on Nima&#x27;s life and works. The former included Nima&#x27;s works in an anthology entitled &quot;Contemporary Writers and Poets&quot; (1923). The selections presented were: &quot;Afsaneh,&quot; (Myth) &quot;Ay Shab&quot; (O Night), &quot;Mahbass&quot; (Prison), and four short stories.

<text>Eight Crazy Nights, also known as Adam Sandler&#x27;s Eight Crazy Nights, is a 2002 American adult animated Hanukkah musical comedy-drama film directed by Seth Kearsley (in his feature directorial debut), written by Adam Sandler, Allen Covert, Brooks Arthur and Brad Issacs, and produced by Sandler, Covert and Jack Giarraputo. It stars Sandler in his first voice-acting role, alongside future wife Jackie Titone, Austin Stout, Rob Schneider, Kevin Nealon, Norm Crosby and Jon Lovitz. The film centers on Jewish characters alongside Hanukkah.

The title is taken from a line in Sandler&#x27;s series of songs called &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot; that compares the gift-giving traditions of Christmas and Hanukkah: &quot;Instead of one day of presents, we get eight crazy nights!&quot; A new version of &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot; also plays over the film&#x27;s closing credits.

Produced by Sandler&#x27;s production company Happy Madison Productions (as its first animated film), &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; was released in the United States on November 27, 2002, by Columbia Pictures. The film grossed $23.8 million and received negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Davey Stone is a 33-year-old Jewish alcoholic with a criminal record that has earned him animosity in his hometown of Dukesberry, New Hampshire. Taken to court for his recent activity on the first night of Hanukkah, Whitey Duvall, an aging volunteer referee from Davey&#x27;s former basketball league, convinces the judge to have him do community service as a referee-in-training for his Youth Basketball League, but on one condition – if Davey commits another crime before his tenure at the league concludes, he will be sentenced to ten years in prison.

As Davey harasses the players at his first game, Whitey has a seizure and the game is abruptly halted with Davey forfeiting it to the opposing team. Attempting to calm Davey down, Whitey takes him to the mall, where they meet Davey&#x27;s childhood crush Jennifer Friedman, now a divorced single mother who has moved back to Dukesberry and taken a job at the mall, and her pre-teen son Benjamin. Davey still secretly harbors feelings for Jennifer, but Whitey reminds Davey that he lost his chances with Jennifer years ago.

As time progresses, Whitey&#x27;s various attempts to encourage Davey are met with humiliation and assault. Later, Davey bonds with Benjamin while playing basketball at the community center, but the latter&#x27;s unsportsman-like behavior, encouraged by Davey, earns him the ire of his mother. On their respective rides home, they reminisce about their happy childhood together and how much things have changed. When Davey gets home, his trailer is being burned down by one of the men who lost the basketball match to him, though Davey runs inside to rescue a Hanukkah card from his late parents. Whitey invites Davey to live with him and his diabetic twin sister Eleanore; Davey reluctantly accepts. To keep Davey in line, Whitey and Eleanore explain the complex rules of the household, stating that Davey will be evicted if he does not abide.

Davey slowly starts to turn his life around, until one day at a skating rink, Whitey recalls Davey&#x27;s past—en route to one of Davey&#x27;s basketball games, Davey&#x27;s parents died in a car accident and he learned of the tragedy shortly after winning the game. He spent the rest of his childhood in and out of foster facilities and state homes, followed by numbing his pain with alcohol and petty crime during his adolescence and ostracizing himself from Jennifer and his other friends. Enraged after being reminded of his trauma, Davey insults Whitey and Eleanore, resulting in a heartbroken Whitey evicting him from his house.

Davey spends the rest of the day binge-drinking. That night, he breaks into the closed mall and hallucinates the logos and mascots of various stores coming to life and confronting him about his inability to grieve. He finally opens his parents&#x27; Hanukkah card, which contains a heartfelt message asking him not to change who he is, and Davey finally allows himself to mourn his parents. When the police arrive to arrest him, Davey escapes and boards a bus to New York City, but the bus is forced to stop when a thumbtack in the road punctures all rear tires. Reminded of the Miracle of Hanukkah, Davey sets out to find and make amends with Whitey.

Davey finds Whitey at the All-Star Banquet, an annual town celebration in which one member of the community is recognized for positive contributions with the &quot;Dukesberry All-Star Patch&quot;, which Whitey has sought after for thirty-five years. When Whitey is passed over again, he resolves to move to Florida to live the remainder of his life in anonymity. Davey reminds the townspeople of the abuse they, and he himself, have subjected Whitey to throughout his life and the selfless contributions he has made to the community in spite of that. Davey leads them to Whitey, who has gone to the mall with Eleanore. The townspeople thank Whitey for his service over the years and the mayor officially grants him the Patch Award, with previous recipients giving him theirs as well. As Davey and Jennifer reconcile, Whitey goes into another seizure that he enjoys.

==Production==
&quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; was animated by several studios, including Anvil Studios, A. Film A/S, Bardel Entertainment, Goldenbell Animation, Marina Motion Animation, Spaff Animation, Tama Production, Time Lapse Pictures, Y. R. Studio and Yowza! Animation. It was the only animated film that Adam Sandler worked on until &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; in 2012, and remains the only traditionally-animated film with his involvement. This was also the first and only film produced by Meatball Productions, the animation division of Happy Madison Productions.

Kearsley revealed in an email to Doug Walker that certain elements of the film that were notorious, specifically the feces-eating deer scene and even Whitey&#x27;s voice (which was originally more high-pitched and annoying), were intended to be cut, but were kept due to &quot;focus groups&quot; who had seen the film (who lowered Whitey&#x27;s voice), as well as the fact that the product placements were used without permission.

==Music==
The soundtrack was released on November 27, 2002 by Columbia/Sony Music Soundtrax. The soundtrack contains every song in the film, including the new installment of &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot; and a deleted song, called &quot;At the Mall&quot;, sung by Whitey as he strolls through the mall in an alternate opening, included on the DVD release. The soundtrack was pressed onto vinyl in 2021 for the &quot;Vinyl Me, Please&quot; record club.

==Release==
&quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; came in at fifth place on its opening weekend among U.S. box office, making only $14 million since its Wednesday launch. It only grossed a total of $23.6 million in North America and negligible foreign box office receipts, for a total of only $23.8 million worldwide. 

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; has an approval rating of 13% based on reviews from 109 critics and an average score of 3.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Sandler returns to his roots in this nauseating concoction filled with potty humor and product placements.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 23% based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four possible stars and criticized the film&#x27;s dour tone, saying that &quot;The holidays aren&#x27;t very cheerful in Sandlerville.&quot; Matthew Rozsa of &quot;Salon&quot; called it the best known Hanukkah film despite its poor quality. William Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a one out of five stars, saying, &quot;File under &#x27;What the hell were they thinking?&#x27;. With this, and &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;, Sandler&#x27;s pulled off quite the combo. Avoid like the plague.&quot;

Sandler won a 2003 Kids&#x27; Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie&quot;. He was also nominated twice for the 2002 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performances in both &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; and &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;.

<text>Sohrab Sepehri (October 7, 1928 – April 21, 1980; ) was a notable Iranian poet and painter. He is considered to be one of the five most famous Iranian poets who have practiced modern poetry alongside Nima Youshij, Ahmad Shamlou, Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, and Forough Farrokhzad. Sepehri&#x27;s poems have been translated into several languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Lithuanian and Kurdish.

==Biography==
Sohrab was born in Kashan, Iran on October 7, 1928. He grew up in a family that was into art and poetry. Her grandmother, Hamideh-banou Zarabi, was poet. 
His father worked in a post office and loved art. His mother loved poetry and art, too. When he was a child, his father suffered from paralysis and died in 1941. Sohrab missed his only brother who was his only playmate in childhood, too. He completed his elementary and secondary education in Kashan and moved to Tehran in 1943 to study at a teachers&#x27; college (Persian: ). He worked as a teacher for a few years, then enrolled as a student in the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Tehran (Persian: ) and graduated with honours. After finishing his education, he was employed in an oil company, which he left after 8 months. He soon published his first collection of poems named &quot;The Death of Color&quot;, followed by a second collection, &quot;Life Sleeps&quot;. Sohrab Sepehri was very talented in fine arts and his paintings were displayed in many European exhibits. His paintings are about nature; one of them was sold in Tehran in 2018. He is one of Iran&#x27;s foremost modernist painters. Unfortunately, he moved to England for treatment, but he had to return Tehran because of the progression of his illness. Finally, he died in Pars Hospital in Tehran on April 28, 1980. He was buried in Kashan. Sohrab never got married and his grave is frequently visited by many art lovers.

Sepehri travelled to many European countries. In Paris, he enrolled in a lithography course at the school of Fine Arts. However, after he stopped receiving a scholarship, he needed to work and make a living. He sometimes worked hanging from tall buildings to wash the apartments&#x27; windows.

===Poetry===
Well-versed in Buddhism, mysticism, and Western traditions, he blended the Eastern concepts with Western techniques, thereby creating a kind of poetry unprecedented in the history of Persian literature. He had his own style of writing poetry, using short sentences rather than long ones, the latter having been frequently used in Persian poetry for centuries. To him, new forms were new means to express his thoughts and feelings. In one of his works called &#x27;Footsteps of Water&#x27; or &#x27;The Water&#x27;s Footfall&#x27;, Sepehri introduces himself, his family, and his way of thinking in a poetic form. This poem, which is written like a biography, has two aspects: the inner and outer. The inner aspect of this poem is about God&#x27;s recognition through the beauty of nature. Sepehri explains that he doesn&#x27;t blindly do his religious duties. In most of his poems, Sepehri introduces a new form of literature by using romanticism and symbolism. The beauty of his poems is seen through his evocation of nature and the use of tender and simple language. Abdolali Dastgheib, acclaimed literary critic and writer, believes that Sepehri reached great levels in poetic language following the publication of his later books such as &#x27;The Water&#x27;s Footfall&#x27;, &#x27;Traveller&#x27; and &#x27;The Green Volume&#x27;. There are many examples of personifications, or symbols in his poetry. In his poem &quot;Let&#x27;s not Spoil the Water&quot;, he talks about water, the necessary and basic element of life which people must keep clean. He used a special symbolism in these poems that makes the objects talk to the reader, rather than describing those objects.

Sepehri&#x27;s poetry is full of humanity and concern for human values. He also achieved a new technique in painting which is called Texture, and was unknown to other painters for a long time. He used to create most of his pieces of art in isolated places like &quot;Ghariyeh Chenar&quot; and the deserts around Kashan. His poetry has been translated into many languages including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Swedish, Arabic, Turkish, Dutch and Russian.

The first known translation into English of Sepehri&#x27;s long poem, Seday-e Pay-e Ab (صدای پای آب) by Abbas Faiz and Martin Turner was published as &quot;Water&#x27;s Footfall&quot; by Cambridge University Press in 1986.

An English translation by Ali Salami of some of Sepehri&#x27;s poems was published in 2003.

<doc id="531818" wikidata="Q366521" url="?curid=531818" title="Ahmad Shamlou">
<text>Ahmad Shamlou (, &quot;Ahmad Šāmlū&quot; , also known under his pen name A. Bamdad ()) (December 12, 1925 – July 23, 2000) was an Iranian poet, writer, and journalist. Shamlou was arguably the most influential poet of modern Iran. His initial poetry was influenced by and in the tradition of Nima Youshij. In fact, Abdolali Dastgheib, Iranian literary critic, argues that Shamlou is one of the pioneers of modern Persian poetry and has had the greatest influence, after Nima, on Iranian poets of his era. Shamlou&#x27;s poetry is complex, yet his imagery, which contributes significantly to the intensity of his poems, is accessible. As the base, he uses the traditional imagery familiar to his Iranian audience through the works of Persian masters like Hafez and Omar Khayyám. For infrastructure and impact, he uses a kind of everyday imagery in which personified oxymoronic elements are spiked with an unreal combination of the abstract and the concrete thus far unprecedented in Persian poetry, which distressed some of the admirers of more traditional poetry.

Shamlou has translated extensively from French to Persian and his own works are also translated into a number of languages. He has also written a number of plays, edited the works of major classical Persian poets, especially Hafez. His thirteen-volume &quot;Ketab-e Koucheh&quot; (&quot;The Book of Alley&quot;) is a major contribution in understanding the Iranian folklore beliefs and language. He also wrote fiction and screenplays, contributing to children&#x27;s literature, and journalism.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Ahmad Shamlou was born to Haydar Shamlou and Kowkab Araqi on December 12, 1925, in Rasht to an army family. Ahmad was the second child and the only son in a family of six children. In the manner of many children who grow up in families with military parents, he received his early education in various towns, including Khash and Zahedan in the southeast of Iran, and Mashhad in the northeast, and Rasht in the north. Shamlou&#x27;s childhood and adolescence were neither privileged nor easy and home was not an environment that could foster his sensitivities and he often found solace in solitude. Moving with his family from one town to the next proved a hurdle to Shamlou&#x27;s education.

By 1941, his high school education still incomplete, he left Birjand for Tehran. He intended to attend the German-established Tehran Technical School, one of the best secondary schools of that period and learn the German language. He was admitted to this school on the condition that he be demoted two years. Soon in 1942, he and the rest of the family once again left Tehran to move to Gorgan. In 1945, he made a final attempt at completing his high school degree in Urumieh, but he failed. At age 29, following the fall of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Shamlou was arrested for being a member of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran and imprisoned for more than one year.

===Early work===

Shamlou&#x27;s debut work, &quot;Forgotten Songs&quot; (), was a collection of classical and modern poetry which was published in 1947 with an introduction of Ebrahim Dilmaghanian. In 1948, he started to write in a literary monthly called &quot;Sokhan-no&quot;. Two years later, his first short story, &quot;The Woman Behind the Brass Door&quot; (), was published. His second collection of poems, &quot;Manifesto&quot; (), was published in 1951. He showed inclinations toward socialist ideology. He got a job in the Hungarian embassy as their cultural advisor.

His third collection of poems, &quot;Metals and Sense&quot; (1952), was banned and destroyed by the police. His translations of &quot;Gold in Dirt&quot;, by &quot;Sigmund Motritz&quot;, and the voluminous novel &quot;The Heartless Man&#x27;s Sons&quot; by Mór Jókai, together with all data gathered for his work on the colloquial culture of urban Iranian life (to be known as &quot;The Book Of Alley&quot;) were also confiscated and destroyed. In 1954 he was jailed for 14 months. in 1955 he translated and published three novels by European writers. He became the editor-in-chief of &quot;Bamshad&quot; literary magazine in 1956.

===1957–1959===

He rose to fame from his next volume of poetry, &quot;Fresh Air&quot; (), published in 1957. Zia Movahed, poet and philosopher commented that &quot;Anyone who reads &quot;Fresh Air&quot; today can see that this language, this texture, is different from anything else. In contemporary poetry, few have accomplished this kind of rhythm as Shamlou has. &quot;Fresh Air&quot; was the greatest event in our poetry—after Hafiz&quot;.

His translation of &quot;Barefoot&quot;, a novel by Zaharia Stancu, was released in 1958, establishing Shamlou&#x27;s authority as a translator. In 1959 he began publishing short stories for children, as well as directing documentary films and working for film studios.

===1960–1969===
In 1960, a new collection of his poems, &quot;The Garden of Mirrors&quot;, was released.

In 1961, he became editor-in-chief of &quot;Ketab-e-Hafte&quot;, a magazine that changes the tradition and language of literary journalism in Iran. In 1962 his translations of André Gide and Robert Merle were published. Two collections of poetry were published in 1964: &quot;Ayda in Mirror&quot; and &quot;Moment and Eternity&quot;. A new collection of poems was released in 1965: &quot;Ayda, Trees, Memories and the Dagger&quot;, as well as a new translation. He also began his third attempt to compile &quot;The Book of Alley&quot;. In 1966, another new collection of poems was published, called &quot;Phoenix in the Rain&quot;, and his literary magazine was banned by the Ministry of Information (SAVAK).

In 1967, he became editor-in-chief of &quot;Khusheh&quot;. His new translation of Erskine Caldwell was published, and he participated in the formation of the Union of Iranian Writers and gave several poetry readings at Iranian universities. In 1968, he began his study of Hafez, the classical grand poet of the Persian language; translated García Lorca&#x27;s poems and &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; from &quot;the Old Testament&quot;; organized a week of poetry reading for established and new Iranian poets, which was very well received. The poems debuted at this event appear in a voluminous book edited by Shamlou. In 1969, his weekly magazine was closed down by the police. &quot;Of The Air And Mirrors&quot;, a selection of older poetry, was published, together with his collection of new poems, &quot;Odes for the Earth&quot;.

===1970–1979===
In 1970, &quot;Blossoming in the Mist&quot; was published. He also directed a few documentary films for television and published several short stories for children. In 1971, he redid some of his earlier translations.

In 1972, he taught Persian literature at Tehran University. Several audio cassettes were released of Shamlou reciting other classical and modern poets&#x27; work. He obtained membership in the Iranian Academy of Language. He published several new translations and wrote a few film scripts. He traveled to Paris for medical treatment.

In 1973, two new collections, &quot;Abraham in Fire&quot; and &quot;Doors and the Great China Wall&quot;, were released, along with several new translations. &quot;The Song of Abraham in Fire&quot; in the collection, &quot;Abraham in Fire&quot; is one of the most well-crafted and famous contemporary Persian poems written by Ahmad Shamlou. Shamlou connects his poem to the collective consciousness of the whole world, presenting characters of the hero and even the social scapegoat rather in a curious way as we read about the case of a man who sacrifices himself for land and love and, yet, who is betrayed by others due to their ignorance and biases. In 1975, he published his work and study of Hafez. In 1976, he travelled to the United States and gave poetry readings in many cities. He participated in the San Francisco Poetry Festival before returning to Iran.

In 1977, he published his new poem, &quot;Dagger on the Plate&quot;. He left Iran in protest of the Shah&#x27;s regime and stayed in the United States for a year, giving lectures in American universities.

In 1978, he left the United States for Britain to act as the editor-in-chief for a new publication called &quot;Iranshahr&quot;; he resigned after 12 issues and returned to Iran just after the advent of the revolution. He rejoined the Union of Iranian Writers and began publishing a new periodical, &quot;Ketab-e Jom&#x27;e&quot; to great success. 1978 was a very active year in his life, and he published many poems and translations, as well as giving numerous lectures and readings. He was also elected to the membership of the Writer&#x27;s Union&#x27;s leadership. 1979 was also a year of intense activity. The first and second volumes of &quot;The Book of Alley&quot; went to print. He was also re-elected as a member of the Writer&#x27;s Union&#x27;s leadership.

===1980–2000===
Starting in 1980, owing to the harsh political situation in his country, he led a rather secluded life that would last for the next eight years, working with Ayda on &quot;The Book Of Alley&quot;, as well as many other literary endeavors, including a translation of &quot;And Quiet Flows The Don&quot; by Mikhail Sholokhov. In 1984 he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

In 1988 he was invited by Interlit, the World Literary Congress. He toured Europe giving many lectures and readings. His complete collection of poems was printed in Germany, and he returned to Iran. In 1990 he toured the United States. Human Rights and The Fund For Freedom of Expression presented him with their annual award. Several works were published in his poetry and his overall literary contribution.

In 1991 he toured Europe again and returned to Iran for another four years of intensive work. That same year, he won the &quot;Freedom of Expression Award&quot; given by the New York–based Human Rights Watch. In 1992, his work &quot;Sacred Words&quot; appeared in Armenian and English. In 1994, he toured Sweden, invited by his Swedish editor Masoud Dehghani Firouzabadi, giving numerous lectures and readings.

In 1995, he finished the translation of &quot;And Quiet Flows The Don&quot;. There was a special gathering in Toronto of Iranian writers and critics to discuss Shamlou&#x27;s contribution to Persian poetry. His &quot;Aurora!&quot; was also published in Spanish. In 1999, he was presented with the Stig Dagerman Prize by the Swedish Foundation.

===Personal life===

Shamlou was married three times. In 1947, he married Ashraf Isslamiya (d. 1978), and together they had three sons and a daughter: Siavash Shamlou, (1948–2009), Sirous Shamlou, Saman Shamlou, Saghi Shamlou. They divorced in 1957 after several years of conflict and long separation. His second marriage to (1917–1996) who was older than Shamlou, ended in divorce in 1963 after four years of marriage.

He met Aida Sarkisian in the spring of 1962 and they were married two years later in 1964. Aida came from an Armenian-Iranian family who lived in the same neighborhood as Shamlou. Her Christian family objected to the marriage on the basis of the Islamic background of Shamlou&#x27;s family. Moreover, Shamlou was older, and had been divorced twice. She became an instrumental figure in Shamlou&#x27;s life, and they remained together until his death in 2000. Her name appears in many of his later poems. She currently lives in Karaj.

===Death===
Suffering from several illnesses at the same time, Shamlou&#x27;s physical condition deteriorated in 1996. He underwent several operations, and in 1997, his right foot was amputated due to severe diabetic problems. He died on Sunday, 23 July 2000, at 9 p.m. at his home in Dehkadeh Fardis in Karaj due to complications from his diabetes. On 27 July thousands took part in Ahmad Shamlou&#x27;s funeral. He was buried in Emamzadeh Taher, Karaj.

==Works and style==

Ahmad Shamlou has published more than seventy books: 16 volumes of poetry; 5 anthologies of poetry; 5 volumes including novels about kids, short stories &amp; screenplays about soup; 9 volumes of children&#x27;s literature about Clifford; 9 translations of poetry into Persian; 21 novels translated into Persian; 5 collections of essays, lectures and interviews; 10 volumes (to date) of &quot;The Book Of Alley&quot;.

Ahmad Shamlou&#x27;s poetic vision accords with both western Modernist concepts and the modern transformation of classical Persian poetry. The Spanish poet, Federico García Lorca, the African American poet Langston Hughes, the French thinker and writer, Louis Aragon, and Nima Youshij are among the figures who influenced him. One of the disciples of Nima Youshij, Shamlou, standing among the generation who adopted his techniques, constantly sought untried ways, new poetic realms. He quickly became the flag bearer of young Iranian poets and writers that included Forough Farrokhzad, Sohrab Sepehri, Mehdi Akhavan Sales, Yadollah Roya’i, Nosrat Rahmani, and Nader Naderpour.

Shamlou is known for employing the style and words of the everyman. He developed a simple, free poetic style, known in Iran as &quot;Sepid Persian Poetry&quot; (literally meaning &quot;white&quot;), which is a kind of free verse that departs from the tightly balanced rhythm and rhymes of classical Persian poetry. The themes in his poetry range from political issues, mostly freedom, to the human condition.

Shamlou&#x27;s poems are filled with mythological concepts and symbols to glorify seemingly simple and ordinary figures who are politically condemned for their revolutionary beliefs that, regardless of governmental suppression, actually reflect the activists’ deep love of their nation and people. Even though his focus is the purity of such individuals, many of whom were his close friends, Shamlou writes his elegiac poems boldly, and does not hold back from criticizing and denouncing hypocrisy and cruelty of his society.

==Political views==
Shamlou was a Marxist and a socially minded intellectual who has woven personal love and affection together with his social attitudes. He was a major force in the intellectual movement opposed to the former Shah of Iran before the 1979 revolution. During his long life, Shamlou was politically active and imprisoned twice, first after the end of World War II and then after the 1953 coup, but he continued to remain socio-politically active by writing poems devoted to political and social critique even after the Iranian Revolution. In 1976, he left his country as a form of protest against censorship and the suffocating political atmosphere. In 1977, one year before the collapse of the Shah&#x27;s Regime, he signed an open letter which supported the rights of gathering for members of The Writers Association of Iran. New Islamic regime wasn&#x27;t favorable to him, considering him as an anti-Islamist nationalist element, a traitor and a Westernised writer. However, with a view to his popularity, the ruling clerics could not arrest him, but at the same time didn&#x27;t allow publication of his works for many years. Since the early 1990s his poems have appeared in many literary journals.

== Adaptations ==
===&quot;The Fairies Opera&quot;===
In 1989 the Persian-Canadian composer Sheida Gharachedaghi wrote an opera based on the English translation of Shamlou&#x27;s &quot;The Fairies&quot;. 
&quot;The Fairies Opera&quot; had a Live performance in Toronto in 1989. The CD of the 1989 - live performance of this opera was released in July 2020 in Europe on the occasion of Shamlou&#x27;s 20th death anniversary. Kayhan Kalhor had sung &quot;The Fairies&quot; in Persian with solo instrument Setar in one part of the live performance, however this part is not included in the CD. 
The composer had tried to obtain the permission to release this CD in Iran as well, but due to ban of solo female singing, the permit had not been issued. The British journal &quot;Opera&quot; writes: &quot;with lyrics such as ‘everybody sing and dance/ this is a real person’s chance’, ‘darkness away, devils die!’... it&#x27;s not hard to fathom why the work has been banned in Iran for three decades.&quot;

===&quot;Abraham in Flames&quot; ===
&quot;Abraham in Flames&quot; ابراهیم در آتش, an opera created by Niloufar Talebi with composer Aleksandra Vrebalov and director Roy Rallo, world premiered on May 9–12, 2019 at San Francisco&#x27;s Z Space as an immersive performance. &quot;Abraham in Flames&quot; is inspired by the imagery in Shamlou&#x27;s life and poetry, and trials by fire in our search for truth, a metaphor Shamlou often used in his poetry. The opera was called &quot;...An amazing achievement for everybody involved, and truly a worthy addition to the opera world&quot; and became a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; 2019 &quot;Best in New Music and Classical Performance&quot; selection.

<text>Luxottica Group S.p.A. is an Italian eyewear multinational corporation headquartered in Milan. As a vertically integrated company, Luxottica designs, manufactures, distributes, and retails its eyewear brands through its own subsidiaries. It is the largest eyewear company in the world. It is, since October 2018, a subsidiary of EssilorLuxottica, which arose out of a merger between the Italian company and the French ophthalmic optics corporation Essilor.

Luxottica was founded in Agordo by Leonardo Del Vecchio in 1961 as a sunglasses manufacturer selling and branding under its own name. Del Vecchio quickly acquired numerous businesses in the pursuit of vertical integration, buying distribution companies rapidly and signing its first designer licensing agreement with Giorgio Armani. In 1990, the company listed American depositary receipts on the New York Stock Exchange where it traded until 2017.

Luxottica retails its products through stores that it owns, predominantly LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, Target Optical, and Glasses.com. It also owns EyeMed, one of the largest vision health insurance providers. In addition to licensing prescription and non-prescription sunglasses frames for many luxury and designer brands including Chanel, Prada, Giorgio Armani, Burberry, Versace, Dolce and Gabbana, Michael Kors, Coach, Miu Miu and Tory Burch, the Italian corporation further outright owns and manufactures Ray-Ban, Persol, Oliver Peoples, and Oakley. Luxottica&#x27;s market power has allowed it to charge price markups of up to 1000%.

In January 2017, Luxottica announced its merger with Essilor, in which Essilor would buy Luxottica while Del Vecchio would become executive chairman of the combined company, as well as co-lead the company with then-Essilor CEO Hubert Sagnières. The combined entity would command more than one quarter of global value sales of eyewear. In March 2018, the European Commission unconditionally approved the merger of Essilor and Luxottica. On 1 October 2018, the new holding company EssilorLuxottica was born, resulting in combined market capitalization of approximately $70 billion.

== History ==
=== Foundings of Luxottica ===

Leonardo Del Vecchio started the company in 1961, in Agordo north of Belluno, Veneto; today the company is headquartered in Milan, Italy.

Del Vecchio began his career as the apprentice to a tool and diemaker in Milan, but he decided to turn his metalworking skills to making spectacle parts. In 1961, he moved to Agordo in the province of Belluno, home to most of the Italian eyewear industry. The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership with Del Vecchio as one of the founding partners. In 1967, he started selling complete eyeglass frames under the Luxottica brand, which proved successful enough that by 1971 he ended the contract manufacturing business.

=== Vertical integration and acquisitions ===
Convinced of the need for vertical integration, he acquired Scarrone in 1974, a distribution company. In 1981, the company set up its first international subsidiary, in Germany, the first in a rapid period of international expansion. The first of many licensing deals with a designer was struck with Giorgio Armani in 1988.

The company listed in New York in 1990, and in Milan in December 2000, joining the MIB-30 (now FTSE MIB) index in September 2003. The listing raised money for the company and allowed it to use its shares to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue Eyewear in 1990, Persol and LensCrafters in 1995, Ray-Ban from Bausch &amp; Lomb in 1999 and Sunglass Hut in 2001. Luxottica later increased its presence in the retail sector by acquiring Sydney-based OPSM in 2003, Pearle Vision and Cole National in 2004.

Luxottica acquired Oakley in November 2007 for US$2.1 billion. Oakley had tried to dispute their prices because of Luxottica&#x27;s large marketshare, and Luxottica responded by dropping Oakley from their stores, causing their stock price to drop, followed by Luxottica&#x27;s hostile take over of the company.

In August 2011, Luxottica acquired Erroca for €20 million. In March 2014, it was announced that Luxottica would partner with Google on the development of Google Glass and its integration into Luxottica&#x27;s eyewear.

=== Reorganization and merger with Essilor ===
On 1 September 2014, a new organizational structure was announced, composed of two co-CEOs, one focusing on market development and the other overseeing corporate functions. After the exit of former CEO Andrea Guerra, Enrico Cavatorta was appointed CEO of Corporate Function and Interim CEO of Market (until new and permanent appointment to this role). Cavatorta left the company 40 days after being appointed CEO. In 2016, it was reported that Luxottica had lost its third chief executive in a year and a half, as Cavatora&#x27;s replacement, Adil Mehboob-Khan stepped down one year after he gained the position. Upon the departure of Mehboob-Khan, Del Vecchio reclaimed executive powers and became much more active in the company.

In January 2017, the company agreed to a merger with Essilor. The deal also offered a succession plan for Leonardo Del Vecchio, the company&#x27;s founder. Shortly before the merger completed, reporter Sam Knight wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;in seven centuries of spectacles, there has never been anything like it. The new entity will be worth around $50bn (£37bn), sell close to a billion pairs of lenses and frames every year, and have a workforce of more than 140,000 people.&quot; On 1 October 2018 the new holding company EssilorLuxottica was founded, resulting in combined market capitalization of approximately €46.3 billion as of the date of the merger announcement.

== Eyewear brands ==
Luxottica&#x27;s two main product offerings are sunglasses and prescription frames. The company operates in two sectors: manufacturing &amp; wholesale distribution, and retail distribution.

The house brands include the following:
The company also makes eyewear under license for the following designer labels:

These brands are sold in the company&#x27;s own shops, as well as to independent distributors such as department stores, duty-free shops, and opticians.

== Retail ==
Luxottica Retail has about 9,100 retail locations in the United States, Latin America, Canada, India, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates. The headquarters of the retail division is in Mason, Ohio, United States (North America). Their retail banners include the following:

Luxottica is the largest optical retailer in the United States, with 7.3% of US retail sales in 2015. With its merger with Essilor in 2018 the company owns Coastal/Clearly, an online contacts and glasses retail giant bought in 2014 that ships to over 200 countries beside its original North American market.

== Medical managed care ==
Luxottica also owns EyeMed Vision Care, a managed vision care organization in the United States. As of 2014, it is the second-largest vision benefits company in the United States.

== Philanthropy ==
Luxottica is affiliated with the charitable organization OneSight, formed in 1988. In August 2018, Luxottica restored Accademia Bridge in Venice. In March 2022, EssilorLuxottica announced the launch of the OneSight EssilorLuxottica Foundation to unify the group&#x27;s philanthropic efforts, primarily providing vision services to underserved communities.

== Criticism ==
=== Monopolistic pricing practices ===
The company has been criticized for the high price of its brand-name glasses, such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, and several others. A 2012 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment focused on whether the company&#x27;s extensive holdings in the industry were used to keep prices high. Luxottica owns not only a large portfolio of brands (over a dozen) such as Ray-Ban and Oakley but also retailers such as Sunglass Hut, Lenscrafters and Oliver Peoples, the optical departments at Target, and (formerly) Sears, as well as key eye insurance groups including the second largest glasses insurance firm in the US, EyeMed. It has been accused of operating a complete monopoly on the optical industry and overcharging for its products; for example, temporarily dropping then-competitor Oakley from its frame design list, then, when the company stock crashed, purchasing the company, then increasing the prices of its Ray-Ban sunglasses. In addition, it has been argued that, by owning the vision insurance company EyeMed, it also controls part of the buyers&#x27; market as well.

The company has said that the market is highly competitive, and that their frames account for ≈10% of sales worldwide and ≈20% in the United States. In 2017, their share of the prescription lens market was 41%. Euromonitor International estimated that Luxottica&#x27;s market share was 14% worldwide, with the second-largest company in the industry, Essilor, holding a 13% market share. The third-largest player was Johnson &amp; Johnson, with a 3.9% market share. In October 2018, Luxottica and Essilor merged into a single company, EssilorLuxottica, which now occupies nearly 30% of the global market share and represents almost a billion pairs of lenses and frames sold annually.

Despite not owning most of the market, the company has considerable price-setting power. It uses &quot;spiff money&quot;, financial incentives to reward other industry players who co-operate with it, and has repeatedly driven companies that competed with it on price out of business, crashing their market share and stock price, then buying them out. It has used a variety of techniques, including compelling retailers to drop suppliers and making imitations of competitor&#x27;s products. It also funds university chairs of opthamology and is influential in professional associations.

The HBO series &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; has criticized the company as a prominent instance of corporate consolidation, as has the TruTV series &quot;Adam Ruins Everything&quot;.

In 2019, LensCrafters founder E. Dean Butler spoke to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, admitting that Luxottica&#x27;s dominance of the eyewear industry had resulted in price markups of nearly 1,000%. In the interview, Butler noted &quot;You can get amazingly good frames, with a Warby Parker level of quality, for $4 to $8. For $15, you can get designer-quality frames, like what you&#x27;d get from Prada.&quot; When told that some eyeglasses cost as much as $800 in the United States, Butler remarked, &quot;I know. It&#x27;s ridiculous. It&#x27;s a complete rip-off.&quot;

<doc id="531823" wikidata="Q6568190" url="?curid=531823" title="List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes">
<text>The American television sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; premiered with an hour-long special on HBO on October 17, 1999. It was followed by a ten-episode first season that began airing on October 15, 2000.

The series was created by Larry David, who stars as a fictionalized version of himself. The series follows Larry in his life as a well-off, semi-retired television writer and producer in Los Angeles. Also starring are Cheryl Hines as his wife, Cheryl; Jeff Garlin as his best friend and manager, Jeff; Susie Essman as Jeff&#x27;s wife, Susie; and J. B. Smoove as Larry&#x27;s housemate, Leon. &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; features many celebrity guest star appearances, fictionalized to varying degrees.

In August 2022, the series was renewed for a twelfth and final season, that premiered on February 4, 2024. 

==Series overview==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Episodes==
===Special (1999)===
===Season 1 (2000)===
The first season introduces Larry&#x27;s post-&quot;Seinfeld&quot; world, where he is wealthy, has a loving wife and a best friend, and manages to offend many people around him.
===Season 2 (2001)===
Larry David pursues a new television project, first with Jason Alexander, and then Julia Louis-Dreyfus after Jason offends him. Based on Alexander&#x27;s frustration with his own post-&quot;Seinfeld&quot; career/life, the premise is about an actor who starred in a megahit sitcom who finds himself typecast. Larry pitches the idea to various networks, but eventually alienates or offends everyone he makes a deal with, and anyone else attached to the project.
===Season 3 (2002)===
Larry joins a restaurant venture with a group of investors; among them are Ted Danson and Michael York. A few subplots involve Larry being cast in a Martin Scorsese movie; an on-again, off-again feud with Stu and Susan Braudy; and Larry getting a pubic hair stuck in his throat.
===Season 4 (2004)===
Larry works with Mel Brooks, Ben Stiller, Cady Huffman and David Schwimmer to star on Broadway in &quot;The Producers&quot;. Larry struggles to fulfill his wife&#x27;s tenth anniversary present to him—a one-time-only act of adultery.
===Season 5 (2005)===
Larry&#x27;s friend Richard needs a kidney transplant operation. Under pressure from his friends and family, Larry offers to donate his own kidney to Richard. Larry then makes concerted efforts to find Richard another kidney donor. Larry thinks that he may have been adopted, because of a potentially misunderstood word his father said (and subsequently denies) while in the hospital, and hires a private investigator (Mekhi Phifer) to look into it.
===Season 6 (2007)===
Cheryl and Larry shelter a New Orleans family named the Blacks (Vivica A. Fox, J. B. Smoove and Ellia English), who move into their house after a hurricane destroyed the Blacks&#x27; home. A distracted phone call between Larry and Cheryl causes her to re-evaluate their marriage dynamic and leave him; Larry thus returns to the dating scene.

Guest stars include: Steve Coogan, Michael McKean, Lucy Lawless, Tim Meadows, Mayim Bialik, Gina Gershon, John McEnroe, Barbara Boxer, John Legend, Diedrich Bader, and Ken Jeong.

===Season 7 (2009)===
Larry and Loretta are in a relationship, which Larry soon realizes is not working for him. She is diagnosed with cancer and breaks up with Larry because she thinks he is cheating on her.

<text>Mohammad-Taqi Bahar (; also romanized as Mohammad-Taqī Bahār; 10 December 1886 in Mashhad – 22 April 1951 in Tehran), widely known as Malek osh-Sho&#x27;arā () and Malek osh-Sho&#x27;arā Bahār (&quot;poet laureate,&quot; literally: &quot;the king of poets&quot;), was a renowned Iranian poet, scholar, politician, journalist, historian and Professor of Literature. Although he was a 20th-century poet, his poems are fairly traditional and strongly nationalistic in character. Bahar was father of prominent Iranist, linguist, mythologist and Persian historian Mehrdad Bahar.

== Biography==
Mohammad-Taqí Bahār was born on 10 December 1886 in the Sarshoor District of Mashhad, the capital city of the Khorasan Province in the north-east of Iran. His father was Mohammad Kazem Sabouri, the Poet Laureate of the shrine in Mashhad who held the honorific title of &quot;Malek o-Sho&#x27;arā&quot; (&quot;King of Poets&quot;), while his mother was a devout woman named Hajjiyeh Sakineh Khanum. Bahār was of Georgian descent on his maternal side. His mother&#x27;s forebears were Georgian notables who had been captured by the troops of Abbas Mirza during the Russo-Iranian Wars and were taken to mainland Iran, where they eventually converted to Islam. Bahār&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather was Hajj Mohammad-Baqer Kashani, who in turn was the son of Hajj Abd ol-Qader Kharabaf of Kashan.

Bahār began his primary education when he was three, with his father, Mohammad Kāzem Sabouri, as his tutor. In addition to his private schooling, Bahār attended one of the traditional schools, &quot;Maktab Khāneh&quot;, in Mashhad. To enhance his knowledge of Persian and Arabic, he further attended the classes of Adib Nai&#x27;shābouri, a traditional poet and literary scholar who promoted the style of the poets of Khorasan in the early Islamic era, in the tradition of the so-called &quot;bāzgasht-e adabī&quot; (literary regress). It has been said that Bahār knew by heart a very good portion of the Koran at a very early age. According to Bahār himself, at seven he read Shahnameh and fully grasped the meaning of Ferdowsi&#x27;s Epic poems.

Bahār composed his first poem at age eight, at which time he also chose the name &quot;Bahār&quot;, meaning Spring, as his pen name (&quot;takhallos&quot; in Persian). It is known that Bahār chose this pen name after Bahār Shirvāni, a poet and close friend of his father&#x27;s, after Shirvāni&#x27;s death. Shirvāni was a renowned poet during Nasser-al-Din Shah Qajar.

At 14, Bahār was fluent in Arabic, and later he achieved spoken and written fluency in French. At 18, he lost his father and started to work as a Muslim preacher and clergy. It was during this time that he composed a long ode (&quot;Qasideh&quot; in Persian) and sent it to Mozzafar-al-Din Shah who became so deeply impressed by this ode that he immediately appointed Bahār as his Poet Laureate and by Royal Decree conferred on him, at the age of 19 (1903), the title of &quot;Malek o-Sho&#x27;arā&quot; at the shrine of Imam Reza in Mashad.

At the onset of the Constitutional Revolution of Iran (1906–1911), Bahār laid down his position of Poet Laureateship and joined the revolutionary movement for establishing the parliamentary system of democracy in Iran. Bahār became an active member of the Mashhad branch of &quot;Anjoman-e Sa&#x27;ādat&quot; (Society for Prosperity) that campaigned for establishment of Parliament of Iran (&quot;Majles&quot;). He published the semi-covert newspaper &quot;Khorāsān&quot;, in collaboration with Hossein Ardebili, &quot;Nou-bahār&quot; (New Spring), and &quot;Tāzeh-bahār&quot; (Fresh Spring), both in collaboration with his cousin Haj Sheikh Ahmad Bahar who operated a printing company and who acted as the Senior Editor first in Mashhad and later in Tehran.

Bahār published numerous articles in his newspapers in which he passionately exhorted his readers to stand up and help bring about the establishment of a functioning Parliament. He equally forcefully advocated the creation of new and reformed public institutions, a new social and political order and of new forms of expression. After the triumph of the Constitutional Revolution, Bahār was repeatedly elected as a Member of Parliament.

In 1918, when Ahmad Shah Qajar, the seventh and the last ruler of the Qajar dynasty, was in power, Bahār reinvented himself: he ceased all his clerical activities and became an entirely new man. At the same time, he together with the writer and poet Saeed Nafisi, the poet and historian Gholam-Reza Rashid Yasemi the historian Abbas Eqbāl Ashtiāni, and his talented friend Abdolhossein Teymourtash founded The Literary Association of the academy (&quot;Anjoman-e Adabi-ye Dāneshkadeh&quot;). The Magazine of the academy (&quot;Majaleh-ye Dāneshkadeh&quot;) was the monthly publication of this Association, in which, in addition to works of prose and poetry, other very informative and useful articles were published, under such diverse titles as &quot;Literary Revolution&quot;, &quot;How other nations view us&quot; and &quot;The Literary History of Iran&quot;. In fact, this magazine became Bahār&#x27;s vehicle for publication of the results of his literary researches and introduction of Western Literature to Iranians. The magazine also played a key role in developing and strengthening the present-day form of Persian Literature.

Following establishment of Tehran University in 1934 (during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi), Bahār became Professor of Persian Literature at the Faculty of Literature of this university. In the course of his tenure as Professor, he dedicated most of his time to writing and editing books on Persian Literature and History. Notable amongst numerous works written and edited by Bahār are:

* &quot;Tārikh-e Sistān&quot; (History of Sistān),
* &quot;Tārikh-e Mokh&#x27;tasar-e Ahzāb-e Siāssi&quot; (A Concise History of the Political Parties),
* &quot;Sabk Shenāsi&quot; (Methodology), which concerns the variety of styles and traditions of Persian prose,
* &quot;Moj&#x27;malal ol-Tavārikh o val Qesās&quot; (Concise Histories and Tales),
* &quot;Javāme&#x27; ol-Hekāyāt&quot; (Anthology of Stories),
* Two volumes of verse, consisting of his own poems.

In 1945, during Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi&#x27;s reign, Bahār served for a short period as the Minister of Culture and Education in the Cabinet of the then Prime Minister Ahmad Qavam (also known as Qavam os-Saltaneh). Earlier in the same year he and Ahmad Qavam had created the &quot;Tiran&quot; Democratic Party (&quot;Hezb-e Demokrāt-e Tirān&quot;).

In the last years of his life, Bahār suffered from Tuberculosis. He sought medical treatment in Leysin, Switzerland, in a sanatorium, where he stayed between 1947 and 1949. It was not long after his return to Iran that his health quickly deteriorated. He died on 21 April 1951, at his home in Tehran. He is entombed in Zahir o-dowleh Cemetery in Darband, located in Shemiran, north of Tehran.

== His poems ==
Although Bahār was a 20th-century poet, his poems are quite traditional and decidedly patriotic. Many scholars have strongly emphasized and documented that Bahār&#x27;s style of writing and the beauty of his poetry, in addition to his deep passion for Iran and his persistent opposition to fanaticism, have indeed made him one of the greatest cultural icons of modern Iran. Although he worked for some period of time as a clergyman and preacher, his first and foremost passion had always been writing, especially of poetry, as well as carrying out historical researches and teaching.

Through his literary magazine, The Magazine of the academy (&quot;Majaleh-ye Dāneshkadeh&quot;), Bahār had a significant impact on the development of modern Persian poetry and literature. One may argue that, to varying degrees, almost all the early advocates of modernism in Persian Poetry and Literature found their inspirations in the new developments and changes that had taken place in Western literature. Nonetheless, such inspirations would not have easily resulted in changes without the efforts and support of such figures as Bahār, whose literary contributions were, and remain consonant with Iranian culture. In Bahār&#x27;s collection of poems, one finds poems composed in almost every tradition of Persian Poetry. To name a few, he wrote Panegyric (&quot;Setāyeshi&quot; or &quot;Madiheh&quot;), Epic (&quot;Hamāsi&quot;), Patriotic (&quot;Mihaní&quot;), Heraldic and Mystic (&quot;Ramzi&quot; or &quot;Sufi&#x27;āneh&quot;), Romantic (&quot;Āasheghāneh&quot;), Ethical (&quot;Akhlāghi&quot;), Didactic (&quot;Āmuzeshi&quot; or &quot;Pandi&quot;), Colloquial (&quot;Goft-o-gu&#x27;í&quot;), and Satirical (&quot;Tanzi&quot; or &quot;Hajvi&quot;). Bahār&#x27;s Official Website has made a selection of Bahār&#x27;s poetry available to the general public, which the interested reader may wish to consult.

=== The Chained White Beast ===
&quot;The Chained White Beast&quot; is a poem by Bahar, written in 1922, in which he praises Damavand, the highest mountain in Iran, and presents it as a symbol of patriotism. The opportunity had come for the nationalists to take the floor and criticize the regime. Bahar&#x27;s symbol for provoking patriotic upheavals is a reflection of the growth of the notion of nationalism which had been introduced to Iranians only few decades before. Bahar describes Damavand as a beast, and asks it to rise and wipe out injustice, and let the real Iran flourish.

<text>Thomas William Heinsohn (August 26, 1934 – November 9, 2020) was an American professional basketball player, coach, and broadcaster. He was associated with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for six decades as a player, coach and broadcaster. He played for the Celtics from 1956 to 1965, and also coached the team from 1969 to 1978. He spent over 30 years as the color commentator for the Celtics&#x27; local broadcasts alongside play-by-play commentator Mike Gorman. He is regarded as one of the most iconic Celtics figures in the franchise&#x27;s history, known during his lifetime for his charisma and loyalty to the team and its traditions. From this, he earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Celtic&quot;.

Heinsohn was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for his contributions as a player. He was also inducted into the Hall of Fame for his success as a head coach. He also helped form the NBA Players Association. Heinsohn was the only person to have the distinction of being involved in an official team capacity in each of the Celtics&#x27; first 17 championships, as well as each of their first 21 NBA Finals appearances.

==Early life==
Thomas William Heinsohn was born on August 26, 1934, in Jersey City, New Jersey. Heinsohn moved while in elementary school to Union City, New Jersey, where he was a standout at St. Michael&#x27;s High School.

==College career==
Heinsohn accepted a scholarship to Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts and became the school&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 1,789 points, an average of 22.1 points per game. During his senior year, Heinsohn scored a school-record 51 points in a game against Boston College, and averaged 27.4 points per game and 21.1 rebounds per game for the season.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics (1956–1965)===

In 1956, Heinsohn was chosen as the Boston Celtics &#x27;regional&#x27;, or &#x27;territorial&#x27;, draft pick. In his first season, Heinsohn played in the NBA All-Star Game and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year over teammate Bill Russell. He finished his rookie season by winning his first championship ring, scoring 37 points and grabbing 23 rebounds in the double-overtime 7th game of the NBA Finals.

Heinsohn was part of a Celtics squad that won eight NBA titles in nine years, including seven in a row between 1959 and 1965. In NBA history, only teammates Russell and Sam Jones won more championship rings during their playing careers, and Heinsohn&#x27;s streak of going to the NBA Finals each season of his nine-year career is unmatched. Heinsohn was also the first in NBA history to score 1,000 points in the NBA Finals. Heinsohn retired after nine seasons due to a foot injury.

During his playing career, Heinsohn was named to six All-Star teams. On the day his teammate and fellow Holy Cross Crusader Bob Cousy retired, Heinsohn scored his 10,000th career point. His number 15 was retired by the Celtics in 1966.

Off the court, Heinsohn played an important leadership role in the NBA Players Association. He was the association&#x27;s second president, following founding president Bob Cousy, and was instrumental in the league&#x27;s acceptance of a pension plan for players following a showdown at the All-Star game in 1964, in which the All-Star players, led by Heinsohn, threatened to strike.

==Coaching career==
===Boston Celtics (1969–1978)===

Heinsohn became the Celtics&#x27; head coach beginning in the 1969–70 season, following Bill Russell&#x27;s retirement as both player and coach. Initially, the team missed Russell&#x27;s impact, and the Celtics struggled in both 1969–70 and 1970–71, failing to reach the playoffs in both seasons.

The team broke through the following season, making the conference finals. Heinsohn then led the team to a league-best 68–14 record during the 1972–73 season and was named Coach of the Year, although Boston was upset in the playoffs by the eventual champion New York Knicks. To date, this is the best regular season record in Celtics history.

The next season Heinsohn and the Celtics won the championship, and they claimed another title in 1976. Between 1971–72 and 1975–76 seasons, the Celtics would win at least 50 games a season. The team would take a step back in the 1976–77 season, finishing 44–38, and was eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.

The Celtics started poorly in the 1977–78 season, and were 11–23 after a loss to the Chicago Bulls in late December. Heinsohn would leave the team shortly thereafter, replaced by his former teammate and coaching assistant Tom &quot;Satch&quot; Sanders. He accumulated a career coaching record of 427–263.

On February 14, 2015, it was announced that Heinsohn would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for a second time as a coaching inductee. He is one of five members of the class of 2015 who were directly elected and is just one of four people to be inducted as both a player and coach.
==Broadcasting career==

Heinsohn&#x27;s broadcasting career began in 1966, calling play-by-play for WKBG&#x27;s Celtics broadcasts, after being asked by Red Auerbach. He spent three seasons in this role before becoming coach in 1969. From 1990 to 1999, Heinsohn was the Celtics&#x27; road play-by-play man on WFXT, WSBK and WABU. In 1981, Heinsohn joined Mike Gorman as color commentator on PRISM New England, which held the Celtics&#x27; television broadcasts. They became one of the longest-tenured tandems in sports broadcasting history. Occasionally, Bob Cousy made appearances with the tandem of Heinsohn and Gorman. On Celtics broadcasts, Heinsohn liked to point out players who displayed extra hustle to help the team by giving them &quot;Tommy Points.&quot; One player in each game had exceptional play and hustle highlighted for the &quot;Tommy Award&quot;. During broadcasts he was known for his sense of humor and indignantly questioning game officials when he felt calls against the Celtics were made in error.

For a time in the 1980s, Heinsohn was in the same capacity during CBS&#x27;s playoff coverage of the NBA (with Dick Stockton), calling four Finals from 1984 to 1987, three of which involved the Boston Celtics against the Los Angeles Lakers. Heinsohn also teamed with Brent Musburger, Verne Lundquist, and James Brown during his time with CBS. Heinsohn also called NCAA college basketball during the Men&#x27;s Tournaments starting with the 1986–87 season, later devoting more time to calling college games for CBS than the pros, being used for regular season as well as tournament games until the 1990 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. For NCAA games, Heinsohn was typically paired with Verne Lundquist. After the 1987 NBA season, Heinsohn was moved from the primary color analyst role to 2nd on the network&#x27;s depth chart, being paired with Brent Musburger for the 1987–88 season, calling solely playoff games. Heinsohn in the 1988–89 season again only called playoff games, paired with Verne Lundquist. In his final season, Heinsohn called a regular-season game for CBS as well as early-round 1990 NBA playoff games with James Brown.
==Personal life and later career==
Heinsohn was married to Diane Regenhard. Their marriage ended in divorce. Tom and Diane Heinsohn had three children: Paul, David, and Donna. He had 5 grandchildren: Danielle, Victoria, Brooke, Adrian, and Christopher. Heinsohn&#x27;s second wife was Helen Weiss, who died in 2008.

Away from the court, Heinsohn enjoyed painting and playing golf; he once headed a life insurance company. In 1988, he wrote a memoir titled &quot;Give &#x27;em the Hook&quot;, with writer Joe Fitzgerald.

==Death==
Heinsohn died at his home from kidney failure on November 9, 2020, at the age of 86.

<doc id="531833" wikidata="Q230939" url="?curid=531833" title="Catherine Bell (actress)">
<text>Catherine Lisa Bell (born 14 August 1968) is a British-American actress and model known for her roles as Lieutenant Colonel Sarah MacKenzie in the television series &quot;JAG&quot; from 1997 to 2005, Denise Sherwood in the series &quot;Army Wives&quot; from 2007 to 2013, and Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Nightingale in Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;The Good Witch&quot; films and television series from 2008 to 2021.

==Early life==
Catherine Lisa Bell was born on 14 August 1968 in London to a Scottish father, Peter Bell, and an Iranian mother, Mina Ezzati. Peter was working as an architect under contract to an oil company in Iran; Mina had travelled to London to study nursing. Bell&#x27;s parents divorced when Catherine was two years old. She was raised by her mother and maternal grandparents. The family eventually moved to California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley where Bell was exposed to diverse influences. The family spoke Persian at home. In her teenage years, Catherine came under the influence of her California surroundings: &quot;I am definitely a Valley Girl. I was a tomboy. I liked to skateboard, play football, and push the envelope a little bit&quot;. Catherine enrolled at UCLA, where she considered a career in medicine or research. However, when she was offered a modelling job in Japan, where advertisers value &quot;American beauty&quot;, she dropped out during her second year.

==Career==

When Bell returned to the United States, she decided to try acting. She studied at the Beverly Hills Playhouse with Milton Katselas. She also worked as a massage therapist for eight years at the Peninsula Hotel, and her clients included singer Peter Gabriel. Bell&#x27;s first television acting role was one line spoken to Gabriel on the short-lived 1990 sitcom &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;.

Among her first parts was Isabella Rossellini&#x27; body double for the 1992 film &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;.

In 1994, Bell starred in the Dolph Lundgren film &quot;Men of War&quot;. While filming the movie in Thailand, Bell and her co-star Trevor Goddard bonded over contracting amoebic dysentery. Goddard would play Bell&#x27;s off-and-on love interest Mic Brumby the following year on &quot;JAG&quot;. They remained friends until Goddard&#x27;s death from a drug overdose in June 2003, an event that the bereaved Bell described as &quot;horrible&quot;.

In 1995, she obtained a three-line role in one episode of the NBC TV series &quot;JAG&quot;, which centers on the work of the United States Department of the Navy&#x27;s Judge Advocate General office. NBC canceled the show after which it was picked up by CBS, which restructured the series, incorporating a female Marine Corps lawyer character, Sarah MacKenzie. Bell auditioned for that role and won it. She continued in this role until the series ended in 2005.

Beginning in 2007, Bell starred in Lifetime&#x27;s ensemble drama series &quot;Army Wives&quot; as Denise Sherwood, the wife of a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, who endures domestic violence at the hands of her teenage son during the show&#x27;s first season.

Bell played the role of Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Nightingale, the main character of Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;The Good Witch&quot; (2008), and its sequels &quot;The Good Witch&#x27;s Garden&quot; (2009), &quot;The Good Witch&#x27;s Gift&quot; (2010), &quot;The Good Witch&#x27;s Family&quot; (2011), &quot;The Good Witch&#x27;s Charm&quot; (2012), &quot;The Good Witch&#x27;s Destiny&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Good Witch&#x27;s Wonder&quot; (2014). She was also a co-executive producer of all of the movies. She also starred in the Lifetime movie titled &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (2011).

In 2015, it was reported that Bell would star in the movie &quot;Love Finds Its Way&quot;, which would begin filming in 2016. Production began on the film in March 2017, with Vancouver as the filming location, and 9 July 2017 as the date for the film&#x27;s premiere on the Hallmark Channel.

On 2 April 2019, CBS announced that Bell would be reprising her &quot;JAG&quot; role of Sarah &quot;Mac&quot; MacKenzie alongside former co-star David James Elliott for a multi-episode arc in the tenth season of &quot;&quot;.

In 2022, Bell starred in the Lifetime film &quot;Jailbreak Lovers&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; feature film which tells the story of how Toby Dorr snuck inmate John Manard out of prison in a dog crate which sparked a manhunt.

==Personal life==

Bell is fluent in Persian and English. She is fond of motorcycling, skiing, snowboarding and kickboxing. Her hobbies include cross-stitching and making model cars, which she has done since age eight.

During the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Bell took flying lessons in a Cirrus SR22. 

Bell met actor-production assistant Adam Beason on the set of the 1992 film &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;. They were married on 8 May 1994. They are the parents of two children. They lived in a nearly faux-Tuscan-style mini-mansion in Calabasas, California. The couple sold the house in 2010 and publicly confirmed that they had separated sometime before September 2011. They eventually divorced in 2011.

Since 2012, Bell has lived with fellow Scientologist, photographer and party planner Brooke Daniells, together with their children, in Los Angeles. In 2014, Bell paid US$2.05 million for a single-story ranch house on a lot in the gated Hidden Hills community in the western suburbs of Los Angeles. She later moved to Clearwater Beach, Florida.
===Scientology===
Bell was raised Roman Catholic and attended an all-girls Catholic school (Our Lady of Corvallis High School in Los Angeles). She is a practicing Scientologist. Bell has attested to attaining the Scientology state of Clear. She has supported Scientology&#x27;s Hollywood Education and Literacy Project. In December 2005, Bell helped promote the gala opening of the of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (a Scientology supported group). In February 2006, Bell appeared in a Scientology music video called &quot;United&quot;.

<doc id="531837" wikidata="Q2869956" url="?curid=531837" title="1954 United States Capitol shooting">
<text>The 1954 United States Capitol shooting was a domestic terrorist attack on March 1, 1954, by four Puerto Rican nationalists seeking to promote Puerto Rican independence from the United States. They fired 30 rounds from semi-automatic pistols onto the legislative floor from the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Gallery&quot; (a balcony for visitors) of the House of Representatives chamber within the United States Capitol.

The nationalists, identified as Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodríguez, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and began shooting at Representatives in the 83rd Congress, who were debating an immigration bill. Five Representatives were wounded, one seriously, but all recovered. The assailants were arrested, tried successively in two federal courts and convicted. All received long consecutive sentences, amounting to life imprisonment. In 1978 and 1979, their sentences were commuted by President Jimmy Carter. All four returned to Puerto Rico.

==Background==
===Independence movement in Puerto Rico===

The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was founded on September 17, 1922, by people seeking independence. They contended that, as a matter of international law, the 1898 Treaty of Paris, ending the Spanish–American War, could not empower the Spanish to &quot;give&quot; what was no longer theirs, in light of the 1897 &quot;Carta de Autonomía&quot; (Spanish Charter of Autonomy), whereby the Spanish Empire released Puerto Rico from colonial rule, giving the island sovereignty. While the Nationalists and other political parties supported independence, some political parties supported autonomy for the island within a formal relationship with the United States.

During this period of unrest, the electorate increasingly voted for the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PPD), which by 1940 controlled a majority in the legislature. It supported the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 by the US Congress, which established Puerto Rico as an &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (&quot;Free Associated State&quot;), with some autonomy. The people could elect their own governor, from the ruling PPD party; a bicameral legislature was established, and executive functions similar to those of American states were developed. The US retained responsibility for defense and foreign treaties.

===Puerto Rican Nationalist Party response===

The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s were a call for independence against the US government. The party demanded the recognition of the 1897 &quot;Carta de Autonomía&quot;, and Puerto Rico&#x27;s international sovereignty. It also repudiated the status of &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot;, established in 1950 by law, as continued colonialism.
The Nationalist president, Pedro Albizu Campos, ordered armed uprisings on October 30, 1950, in several towns, including Peñuelas, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo and Ponce. The most notable uprisings occurred in Utuado, Jayuya, and San Juan. They were suppressed by Puerto Rican forces, assisted by US forces.

In Utuado, police killed the insurgents after they attacked the station. In Jayuya, insurgents declared the &quot;Free Republic of Puerto Rico&quot; after taking control of the police station; they held the city for three days, until the U.S. sent bomber planes, artillery, Puerto Rican National Guard and Army troops to suppress the revolt. In San Juan, the Nationalists attacked the governor&#x27;s residence, intending to assassinate the governor, Luis Muñoz Marín, but were unsuccessful.
The revolts resulted in many casualties: of the 28 dead, 16 were Nationalists, 7 were police officers, 1 a National Guardsman, and 4 were uninvolved civilians. Of the 49 wounded, 23 were police officers, 6 were National guardsmen, 9 were Nationalists, and 11 were uninvolved civilians.

The actions were not limited to Puerto Rico. Two Puerto Rican Nationalists, who were living in New York City at the time, planned to assassinate the US president, Harry S. Truman. On November 1, 1950, they attacked police and Secret Service to gain access to Blair House in Washington, D.C., where Truman was staying during major renovations of the White House. One Nationalist, Griselio Torresola, was killed in the attack, as was a White House police officer, Leslie Coffelt. The other, Oscar Collazo, was tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison.

Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rico&#x27;s status, Truman supported a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 offering a choice between continued direct rule as a colony and limited autonomy. While nearly 82% of those voting approved the new constitution and Free Associated State, or Commonwealth, independence was not an option on the ballot and most Nationalists boycotted the election.

===Attack preparations===

Nationalists were not satisfied with the people&#x27;s vote in the plebiscite. In the early 1950s, Don Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, had been corresponding from his prison with 34-year-old Lolita Lebrón. Some of this correspondence discussed the Nationalist Party revolts of 1950. It also discussed Puerto Rican Governor Luis Muñoz Marín, who had succeeded in having Puerto Rico declared an &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (Free Associated State) of the U.S.

In 1954, a group of Nationalists, which included Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andrés Figueroa Cordero, decided to focus the world&#x27;s attention on Puerto Rico&#x27;s status, which they considered as a colony of the U.S. They planned to attack multiple locations in Washington, D.C., with force.

Albizu Campos did not order this attack, but the Nationalists continued to plan for it. Lebrón decided to lead the group and, eventually, the attack. Lebrón concluded that a single attack on the House of Representatives had a greater prospect for success than trying to attack multiple targets. They chose the date of March 1, 1954, to coincide with the opening of the &quot;Conferencia Interamericana&quot; (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries at the conference.

==Attack==
On the morning of March 1, Lebrón traveled to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, where she rendezvoused with the rest of the group. They took the train to Washington, DC, and went the short distance from Union Station to the Capitol. Rafael Cancel Miranda suggested they postpone the attack, as it was late and the weather was rainy. Lebrón said, &quot;I am alone&quot; and continued towards the Capitol building&#x27;s interior. The group looked at each other, and decided to follow her.

When Lebrón&#x27;s group reached the visitor&#x27;s gallery above the House chamber, they sat while the representatives discussed the Mexican economy and issues of immigration. After Lebrón gave the order, the group quickly recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. She stood up and shouted, &quot;&quot;¡Viva Puerto Rico libre!&quot; (approximately, &quot;Long live a free Puerto Rico!&quot;&quot;) and unfurled the flag of Puerto Rico. The group opened fire with semi-automatic pistols toward the Representatives below.

Some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers. Lebrón said she fired her shots at the ceiling, while Figueroa&#x27;s pistol jammed. Wounded were Alvin Morell Bentley (R-Michigan), who took a bullet to the chest, Clifford Davis (D-Tennessee), hit in the leg, Ben F. Jensen (R-Iowa), shot in the back, as well as George Hyde Fallon (D-Maryland) and Kenneth A. Roberts (D-Alabama). House pages helped carry Bentley off the House floor. The representatives were treated and recovered. 
Upon being arrested, Lebrón yelled, &quot;I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!&quot;

==Aftermath and arrests==
The Nationalists were immediately arrested in Washington, D.C. The next morning in Puerto Rico, the Insular Police raided the home of Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Nationalist Party, with guns and tear gas. Under the command of the Chief of Police of Puerto Rico, Salvador T. Roig, they fired into Campos&#x27; home from the roof of a Pentecostal Church and from a boarding house which faced the home. They arrested Campos and took him to jail. He was unconscious and half-asphyxiated when taken from the house.

Police Chief Roig later said that the order to arrest Albizu Campos &quot;did not make any sense.&quot; Albizu Campos&#x27;s phones were tapped, his mail was being intercepted, and Albizu was under 24-hour surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and the Insular Police. The FBI reports on Albizu Campos and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ultimately exceeded over one million pages in length. They found no evidence that Albizu was directly connected with the attack on Congress.

The Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín, revoked Albizu&#x27;s pardon, and had the political leader returned to La Princesa prison, from which he had been released only six months before. He was accused of sedition, violation of Puerto Rico Law 53 of 1948 (otherwise known as the &quot;Gag Law&quot;) and the attempted violent overthrow of the U.S. government.
Two years later, on March 25, 1956, Albizu Campos suffered an embolism and a stroke while in prison, leaving him semi-paralyzed and mute. He was not released from U.S. federal custody for another nine years, shortly before his death, which occurred on April 21, 1965.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Lebrón, Cancel Miranda and the other defendants were charged in federal court in Washington with attempted murder and other crimes. The trial began on June 4, 1954, with federal Judge Alexander Holtzoff presiding over the case, under strict security measures. A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled; their identities were kept secret. The prosecution was led by Leo A. Rover; 33 witnesses testified.

Ruth Mary Reynolds helped secure the services of noted activist attorney Conrad Lynn as a lawyer for Lebrón and the other three co-defendants. The accused were the only ones to testify in their defense. Lebrón reaffirmed that she came, not to kill, but &quot;to die for the freedom of her homeland.&quot;

On June 16, 1954, the jury declared the four guilty, except that Lebrón was acquitted of assault with the intent to kill and instead convicted of the lesser offense of assault with a deadly weapon. Judge Holtzoff imposed maximum consecutive prison terms: 75 years&#x27; imprisonment for each of the men, and 50 years for Lebrón. Given the age of the accused, this effectively meant imprisonment for life, unless they were paroled earlier.

American League lawyers appealed the sentence. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the convictions and sentences in early 1956.

On July 13, 1954, the four defendants were taken to New York, where they appeared before federal Judge Lawrence E. Walsh of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to face related charges, with additional co-defendants, of seditious conspiracy. This charge encompassed, but was broader than, the attack on the Congress. They declared themselves not guilty on the charge of &quot;trying to overthrow the government of the United States,&quot; but remained firm in demanding independence for Puerto Rico. Among the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses was Gonzalo Lebrón Jr., who testified against his sister.

On October 26, 1954, the jury found all of the defendants guilty of conspiracy. Judge Walsh sentenced each of them to six additional years in prison. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conspiracy convictions and consecutive sentences in 1955.

The four were sent to different prisons: Figueroa Cordero to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta; Lebrón to the women&#x27;s prison in Alderson, West Virginia; Cancel Miranda to Alcatraz, in San Francisco Bay; and Flores Rodriguez to Leavenworth, Kansas, where Oscar Collazo was incarcerated following his involvement in the attempted assassination of President Harry S Truman in 1950.

=== Release ===
Figueroa Cordero was released in 1978. One year later, in 1979, President Jimmy Carter commuted the sentences of the remaining perpetrators. Some analysts said this was in exchange for Fidel Castro&#x27;s release of several American CIA agents being held in Cuba on espionage charges, but the US said that was not the case. The freed nationalists were received in Puerto Rico with a &quot;heroes&#x27; welcome&quot; by roughly 5,000 people at San Juan International Airport.

<doc id="531842" wikidata="Q6972479" url="?curid=531842" title="National Environmental Policy Act">
<text>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a United States environmental law designed to promote the enhancement of the environment. It created new laws requiring U.S. federal government agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of their actions and decisions, and it established the President&#x27;s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). The Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in December 1969 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on January 1, 1970. To date, more than 100 nations around the world have enacted national environmental policies modeled after NEPA.

NEPA requires Federal agencies to evaluate the environmental effects of their actions. NEPA&#x27;s most significant outcome was the requirement that all executive Federal agencies prepare environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental impact statements (EISs). These reports state the potential environmental effects of proposed Federal agency actions. Further, U.S. Congress recognizes that &quot;each person&quot; has a responsibility to preserve and enhance the environment as trustees for succeeding generations. NEPA&#x27;s procedural requirements do not apply to the President, Congress, or the Federal courts since they are not a &quot;Federal agency&quot; by definition. However, a Federal agency taking action under authority ordered by the President may be a final agency action subject to NEPA&#x27;s procedural requirements.

==History==
NEPA grew out of the increased public appreciation and concern for the environment that developed during the 1960s, amid increased industrialization, urban and suburban growth, and pollution across the United States. During this time, environmental interest group efforts and the growing public awareness resulting from Rachel Carson&#x27;s 1962 book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; led to support for the 1964 Wilderness Act and subsequent legislation (including the 1970 Clean Air Act and 1972 Clean Water Act). The public outrage in reaction to the Santa Barbara oil spill in early 1969 occurred just as the NEPA legislation was being drafted in Congress. A fire on the Cuyahoga River was publicized in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article shortly after the unanimous vote in the Senate. Another major driver for enacting NEPA was the 1960s highway revolts, a series of protests in many American cities that occurred in response to the bulldozing of many communities and ecosystems during the construction of the Interstate Highway System. In addition, as the contribution of Indiana political scientist Lynton Caldwell shows, concern for the environmental recklessness of international development programs in the 1950s and 1960s also drove the thinking behind NEPA.

In 2015 a United States District Court provided a documented concise background of NEPA being created to protect the environment from actions involving the Federal government as follows:

Following nearly a century of rapid economic expansion, population growth, industrialization, and urbanization, it had become clear by the late 1960s that American progress had an environmental cost. A congressional investigation into the matter yielded myriad evidence indicating a gross mismanagement of the country&#x27;s environment and resources, most notably at the hands of the federal government. As a result, lawmakers and the general public alike called for an urgent and sweeping policy of environmental protection.

Congress answered these calls by enacting NEPA, which has served as &quot;our basic national charter for protection of the environment&quot; since 1970. With NEPA, Congress mandated that federal agencies take a &quot;hard look&quot; at the environmental consequences of their actions and to engage all practicable measures to prevent environmental harm when engaging in agency action. Furthermore, to remedy the widespread mistrust of the federal agencies, Congress incorporated within NEPA &quot;action-forcing&quot; provisions which require agencies to follow specific procedures in order to accomplish any federal project.

Since its passage, NEPA has been applied to any major project, whether on a federal, state, or local level, that involves federal funding, work performed by the federal government, or permits issued by a federal agency. Court decisions have expanded the requirement for NEPA-related environmental studies to include actions where permits issued by a federal agency are required regardless of whether federal funds are spent to implement the action, to include actions that are entirely funded and managed by private-sector entities where a federal permit is required. This legal interpretation is based on the rationale that obtaining a permit from a federal agency requires one or more federal employees (or contractors in some instances) to process and approve a permit application, inherently resulting in federal funds being expended to support the proposed action, even if no federal funds are directly allocated to finance the particular action.

A U.S. District Court describes the need for even the President to have the NEPA analysis information before making a decision as follows:

&quot;No agency possesses discretion whether to comply with procedural requirements such as NEPA. The relevant information provided by a NEPA analysis needs to be available to the public and the people who play a role in the decision-making process. This process includes the President.&quot; &quot;And Congress has not delegated to the President the decision as to the route of any pipeline.&quot;

==Contents==
The preamble to NEPA reads:

To declare national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation; and to establish a Council on Environmental Quality.

NEPA contains three sections: the first section outlines national environmental policies and goals; the second establishes provisions for federal agencies to enforce such policies and goals; and the third establishes the CEQ in the Executive Office of the President.

The purpose of NEPA is to ensure that environmental factors are weighted equally when compared to other factors in the decision-making process undertaken by federal agencies and to establish a national environmental policy. The act also promotes the CEQ to advise the President in the preparation of an annual report on the progress of federal agencies in implementing NEPA. It also established the CEQ to advise the president on environmental policy and the state of the environment.

NEPA establishes this national environmental policy by requiring federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement to accompany reports and recommendations for Congressional funding. This impact statement is known as an EIS. NEPA is an action-forcing piece of legislation, meaning the act itself does not carry any criminal or civil sanctions, and therefore, all enforcement of NEPA must occur through the court system. In practice, a project is required to meet NEPA guidelines when a federal agency provides any portion of financing for the project. However, review of a project by a federal employee can be viewed as a federal action, and in such a case, it requires NEPA-compliant analysis performance.

NEPA covers a vast array of federal agency actions, but the act does not apply to state action where there is a complete absence of federal influence or funding. Exemptions and exclusions are also present within NEPA&#x27;s guidelines, including specific federal projects detailed in legislation and EPA exemptions. Exemptions also apply when compliance with other environmental laws require an impact analysis similar to that mandated by NEPA. Such laws can include but are not limited to the Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.

==Process==

The NEPA process is the evaluation of the relevant environmental effects of a federal project or action mandated by NEPA. This process begins when an agency develops a proposal addressing a need to take action. If it is determined that the proposed action is covered under NEPA, there are three levels of analysis that a federal agency must undertake to comply with the law. These three levels include the preparation of a Categorical Exclusion (CatEx); an environmental assessment (EA); and either a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or, alternatively, the preparation and drafting of an environmental impact statement (EIS).

Executive Order No. 11514 (March 5, 1970; Nixon administration) as amended by Executive Order No. 11991 (May 24, 1977; Carter administration) directs the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue &quot;regulations to Federal agencies for the implementation of the procedural provisions of&quot; NEPA and for Federal agencies to &quot;comply with the regulations issued by the Council&quot;. Importantly the Supreme Court of the United States finds &quot;that CEQ regulations are entitled to substantial deference.&quot;
The Council on Environmental Quality&#x27;s NEPA regulation 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4 specifies the process to determine whether to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as follows:
In determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement the Federal agency shall:

(a) Determine under its procedures supplementing these regulations (described in § 1507.3) whether the proposal is one which:

:(1) Normally requires an environmental impact statement, or
:(2) Normally does not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).
(b) If the proposed action is not covered by paragraph (a) of this section, prepare an environmental assessment (§ 1508.9). The agency shall involve environmental agencies, applicants, and the public, to the extent practicable, in preparing assessments required by § 1508.9(a)(1).

(c) Based on the environmental assessment make its determination whether to prepare an environmental impact statement.

(d) Commence the scoping process (§ 1501.7), if the agency will prepare an environmental impact statement.

(e) Prepare a finding of no significant impact (§ 1508.13), if the agency determines on the basis of the environmental assessment not to prepare a statement.
:(1) The agency shall make the finding of no significant impact available to the affected public as specified in § 1506.6.
:(2) In certain limited circumstances, which the agency may cover in its procedures under § 1507.3, the agency shall make the finding of no significant impact available for public review (including State and areawide clearinghouses) for 30 days before the agency makes its final determination whether to prepare an environmental impact statement and before the action may begin. The circumstances are:
::(i) The proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one which normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement under the procedures adopted by the agency pursuant to § 1507.3, or
::(ii) The nature of the proposed action is one without precedent.
In addition to complying with the Council on Environmental Quality&#x27;s NEPA regulations in 40 C.F.R. § 1500 through § 1508, each Federal agency is required by 40 C.F.R. § 1507.3(a) to adopt supplemental procedures for their agency&#x27;s implementation of NEPA. For example, the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s supplemental NEPA procedures are in 23 C.F.R. §771.101 through § 771.131. According to 23 C.F.R. § 771.115(a) Class I actions such as a new controlled access freeway or a highway project of four or more lanes on a new location significantly affect the environment and therefore require an Environmental Impact Statement. According to 23 C.F.R. § 771.115(b) and § 771.117(c) Class II actions such as construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, planning, noise barriers, and landscaping normally do not individually or cumulatively have a significant environmental effect and therefore may be categorically exempt unless there are unusual circumstances as provided in 23 C.F.R. § 771.117(b). According to 23 C.F.R. § 771.117(c) all other actions are Class III actions requiring the preparation of an Environmental Assessment to determine the appropriate environmental document required.

===Preparation of a Categorical Exclusion===

A Categorical Exclusion (CatEx) is a list of actions an agency has determined do not individually or cumulatively significantly affect the quality of the human environment (40 C.F.R. §1508.4). If a proposed action is included in an agency&#x27;s CatEx, the agency must make sure that no extraordinary circumstances might cause the proposed action to affect the environment. Extraordinary circumstances include effects on endangered species, protected cultural sites, and wetlands. If the proposed action is not included in the description provided in the CatEx, an EA must be prepared. Actions similar to the proposed one may have been found to be environmentally neutral in previous EAs and their implementation, and so an agency may amend their implementing regulations to include the action as a CatEx. In this case, the drafted agency procedures are published in the &quot;Federal Register &quot;and a public comment period is required. An agency cannot rely on a CatEx prepared by a different agency to support a decision not to prepare an EA or EIS for a planned action; however, it may draw from another agency&#x27;s experience with a comparable CatEx in seeking to substantiate a CatEx of its own.

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) created Categorical Exclusions to reduce paperwork (40 CFR § 1500.4(p)) and reduce delay (40 CFR § 1500.5(k)) so agencies can better concentrate on actions that do have significant effects on the human environment. In 2003 the National Environmental Policy Task Force found agencies &quot;indicated some confusion about the level of analysis and documentation required to use an approved categorical exclusion&quot;. In 2010 CEQ issued guidance on the existing regulations for Categorical Exclusions consistent with NEPA and past CEQ guidance. This CEQ 2010 guidance acknowledges, &quot;Since Federal agencies began using categorical exclusions in the late 1970s, the number and scope of categorically excluded activities have expanded significantly. Today, categorical exclusions are the most frequently employed method of complying with NEPA, underscoring the need for this guidance on the promulgation and use of categorical exclusions.&quot; This CEQ 2010 guidance goes on to caution, &quot;If used inappropriately, categorical exclusions can thwart NEPA&#x27;s environmental stewardship goals, by compromising the quality and transparency of agency environmental review and decisionmaking, as well as compromising the opportunity for meaningful public participation and review.&quot; Indeed, the expanded use of Categorical Exclusions undermines NEPA by reducing environmental analysis and public comment, thereby increasing NEPA litigation. The CEQ 2010 guidance emphasizes that Categorical Exclusions must capture the entire proposed action and not be used for a segment or an interdependent part of a larger proposed action. Examples of Exceptional Circumstances that prevent use of Categorical Exclusions include where there are &quot;potential effects on protected species or habitat, or on historic properties listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.&quot; The CEQ specifically cites the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill as an example why agencies need to periodically review their Categorical Exclusions &quot;in light of evolving or changing conditions that might present new or different environmental impacts or risks.&quot;

Streamlining the NEPA process with categorical exclusions have been criticized, for example allowing BP&#x27;s exploration plan that resulted in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to use a categorical exclusion instead of requiring an Environmental Impact Statement.

===Preparation of an Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact===

EAs are concise public documents that include the need for a proposal, a list of alternatives, and a list of agencies and persons consulted in the proposal&#x27;s drafting. The purpose of an EA is to determine the significance of the proposal&#x27;s environmental outcomes and to look at alternatives of achieving the agency&#x27;s objectives. An EA is supposed to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS, aid an agency&#x27;s compliance with NEPA when no EIS is necessary, and it facilitates preparing an EIS when one is necessary.

Most agency procedures do not require public involvement prior to finalizing an EA document; however, agencies advise that a public comment period is considered at the draft EA stage. EAs need to be of sufficient length to ensure that the underlying decision to prepare an EIS is legitimate, but they should not attempt to substitute an EIS.

However, the Council on Environmental Quality regulation 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b) states: &quot;NEPA procedures must insure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.&quot; Likewise, 40 C.F.R. § 1500.2 states: &quot;Federal agencies shall to the fullest extent possible: ... (d) Encourage and facilitate public involvement in decisions which affect the quality of the human environment.&quot; A U.S. District Court describes the essential requirement for public input on a draft EA as follows:
The Ninth Circuit has read these regulations to mean that &quot;the public must be given an opportunity to comment on draft EAs and EISs.&quot; &quot;Anderson v. Evans&quot;, 371 F.3d 475, 487 (9th Cir.2004). Because the regulations &quot;must mean something,&quot; the Circuit has held that an agency&#x27;s failure to obtain any public input on a draft EA &quot;violates these regulations.&quot; &quot;Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture&quot;, 341 F.3d 961, 970 (9th Cir.2003).

If no substantial effects on the environment are found after investigation and the drafting of an EA, the agency must produce a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). This document explains why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment and includes the EA or a summary of the EA that supports the FONSI determination.

===Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement===
If it is determined that a proposed federal action does not fall within a designated CatEx or does not qualify for a FONSI, then the responsible agency must prepare an EIS. The purpose of an EIS is to help public officials make informed decisions based on the relevant environmental consequences and the alternatives available. The drafting of an EIS includes public party, outside party, and other federal agency input concerning its preparation. These groups subsequently comment on the draft EIS.

An EIS is required to describe the environmental impacts of the proposed action, any adverse environmental impacts that cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, the reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, the relationship between local short-term uses of man&#x27;s environment along with the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the proposed action.

An agency may undertake the drafting of an EIS without the initial drafting of the EA. This may happen if the agency believes that the action will have a significant impact on the human or natural environment or if the action is considered an environmentally controversial issue.

The responsible decision-maker is required to review the final EIS before reaching a final decision regarding the course of action to be taken. The decision-maker must weigh the potential environmental impacts along with other pertinent considerations in reaching the final decision. A record of decision (ROD) is issued which records the agency&#x27;s final decision.

===Average time for a full review===
A federal study from 2013-2018 found that a full NEPA review took an average of 4.5 years.

==Mootness doctrine used to evade NEPA requirements==
The Administrative Procedure Act at 5 U.S.C. § 702 provides the right for a person injured by a NEPA issue to carry out a NEPA case in court as: 
A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.
By 5 U.S.C. § 706 the U.S. Congress provides for courts to make equitable remedies such as an injunction to compel agency action withheld or to set aside agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. However, a court case becomes moot when no practical (&quot;live&quot;) issues remain as stated in &quot;Powell v. McCormack&quot;, 395 U. S. 486 (1969) pages 496 – 497:
Simply stated, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer &quot;live&quot; or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. See E. Borchard, Declaratory 497*497 Judgments 35-37 (2d ed. 1941). Where one of the several issues presented becomes moot, the remaining live issues supply the constitutional requirement of a case or controversy. See United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 86-94 (1947); 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 57.13 (2d ed. 1966).
In early NEPA cases (for example &quot;Arlington Coalition on Transportation v. Volpe&quot;, 458 F.2d 1323 (4th Cir. 1972) page 1331) courts determined that projects were beyond the reach of the courts (moot) if that project had progressed to the point that the costs of altering the project would outweigh the benefits. Nevertheless, by 1981 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that some projects might proceed with construction in an attempt to evade the requirements of NEPA. Therefore, the court cautioned that even completed projects could be ordered to be removed, as stated in &quot;Columbia Basin Land Protection Assoc. v. Schlesinger&quot;, 643 F.2d 585 (9th Cir.1981) page 591 note 1:
The building of the towers has not made the case hypothetical or abstract — the towers still cross the fields of the Landowners, continually obstructing their irrigation systems — and this Court has the power to decide if they may stay or if they may have to be removed. * * * 
If the fact that the towers are built and operating were enough to make the case nonjusticiable, as the dissent states, then the BPA (and all similar entities) could merely ignore the requirements of NEPA, build its structures before a case gets to court, and then hide behind the mootness doctrine. Such a result is not acceptable.
Thus, courts have the equitable power to prevent those who use bad faith construction to evade U.S. Congress policies such as NEPA. Despite a court recognizing the use of this mootness tactic, a court still might not order removal of construction and remediation of the environment unless the NEPA complaint seeks removal and remediation in the request for relief as a &quot;live&quot; issue, see dissenting opinion in &quot;West v. Secretary of Dept. of Transp&quot;., 206 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 2000) page 931:
He did not seek remediation; he wanted the interchange stopped. It was built. Therefore, there is no justiciable controversy pertaining to Phase I.
If stopping construction is the only request for relief in a NEPA complaint then logically construction cannot be stopped after completion.

The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in stopping construction of a seaport on Sears Island, Maine pointed out that harm in NEPA cases is harm to the environment as stated in &quot;Sierra Club v. Marsh&quot;, 872 F.2d 497 (1st Cir. 1989) at page 500:
Thus, when a decision to which NEPA obligations attach is made without the informed environmental consideration that NEPA requires, the harm that NEPA intends to prevent has been suffered. * * * the harm at stake is a harm to the environment, but the harm consists of the added risk to the environment that takes place when governmental decisionmakers make up their minds without having before them an analysis (with prior public comment) of the likely effects of their decision upon the environment.
This court in &quot;Sierra Club v. Marsh&quot; on page 504 also found since there is an instinct not to tear down projects, it is appropriate to issue preliminary injunctions early in NEPA cases:
The way that harm arises may well have to do with the psychology of decisionmakers, and perhaps a more deeply rooted human psychological instinct not to tear down projects once they are built. But the risk implied by a violation of NEPA is that real environmental harm will occur through inadequate foresight and deliberation. The difficulty of stopping a bureaucratic steam roller, once started, still seems to us, after reading Village of Gambell, a perfectly proper factor for a district court to take into account in assessing that risk, on a motion for a preliminary injunction.
To have Article III standing to maintain a federal court case at least one individual plaintiff must have an injury caused by the defendant and that injury is likely to be remedied by a favorable decision as stated in &quot;Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife&quot;, 504 U.S. 555, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) on pages 560-561:
Over the years, our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an &quot;injury in fact&quot;—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, see id., at 756; Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508 (1975); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 740-741, n. 16 (1972);[1] and (b) &quot;actual or imminent, not `conjectural&#x27; or `hypothetical,&#x27; &quot; Whitmore, supra, at 155 (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983)). Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be &quot;fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.&quot; Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare 561*561 Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976). Third, it must be &quot;likely,&quot; as opposed to merely &quot;speculative,&quot; that the injury will be &quot;redressed by a favorable decision.&quot; Id., at 38, 43.
To have a &quot;live&quot; issue after completion of construction of a project, at least one person would need to show they will personally suffer harm from existence of the completed project and that the harm can be remedied by removal of the project as in &quot;Columbia Basin Land Protection Assoc. v. Schlesinger&quot;. Individual injuries in NEPA cases may likely involve growth-inducing impacts such as air, noise, and water pollution, safety considerations, secondary impacts, and cumulative impacts; for example see &quot;Coalition for Canyon Preservation v. Bowers&quot;, 632 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1980). Proving individual injury prevents disqualification by an objection of &quot;generalized grievance&quot; as stated in &quot;Juliana v. US&quot;, 217 F. Supp. 3d 1224 (D. Or. 2016):
Standing alone, &quot;the fact that a harm is widely shared does not necessarily render it a generalized grievance.&quot; Jewel, 673 F.3d at 909; see also Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007) (&quot;[I]t does not matter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action&quot; so long as &quot;the party bringing suit shows that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way.&quot; (quotation marks omitted and alterations normalized)); Akins, 524 U.S. at 24 (&quot;[A]n injury . ... widely shared ... does not, by itself, automatically disqualify an interest for Article III purposes.
In determining whether a Federal court has the authority to decide a case (jurisdiction), Federal courts only consider the parts of a complaint supporting the federal issue cited. This is referred to as the &quot;well-pleaded&quot; complaint rule. Parts of a complaint requesting removal of anticipated construction can be ignored by Federal courts since construction was not an actual controversy at the time the complaint was filed. Therefore, if project construction starts after a NEPA complaint is filed, the NEPA complaint will need to be amended or a new complaint filed to include the actual construction. Otherwise after construction is completed, a Federal court may find it no longer has authority (jurisdiction) to decide the case. The case would therefore be moot.

Courts balance the harm an injunction might cause to the defendant against the likelihood of environmental harms occurring and the degree of injury if the environmental harms occur. The U.S. Supreme Court pointed out the irreparable nature of environmental injuries in &quot;Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell&quot;, 480 U.S. 531, 107 S. Ct. 1396, 94 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1987) on page 545:
Environmental injury, by its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often permanent or at least of long duration, i. e., irreparable. If such injury is sufficiently likely, therefore, the balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an injunction to protect the environment.
Courts may discount the defendant&#x27;s self-inflicted harm if construction was started before resolution of the environmental issues as in &quot;Davis v. Mineta&quot;, 302 F.3d 1104 (10th Cir. 2002) on page 1116:
We must next balance the irreparable harms we have identified against the harm to defendants if the preliminary injunction is granted. Defendants allege that significant financial penalties will be incurred by UDOT if the Project is delayed. * * * However, it appears that many of these costs may be self-inflicted. As we have previously concluded, the state entities involved in this case have &quot;jumped the gun&quot; on the environmental issues by entering into contractual obligations that anticipated a pro forma result. In this sense, the state defendants are largely responsible for their own harm.
&quot;Columbia Basin Land Protection Assoc. v. Schlesinger&quot; identified that allowing construction to moot NEPA cases frustrates the U.S. Congress intent. Therefore, In order to prevent NEPA cases from automatically becoming moot due to construction, NEPA complaints would need to request removal of bad faith constructions.

==Council on Environmental Quality==

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was modeled on the Council of Economic Advisers, an executive branch group created by the Employment Act of 1946 to advise the President on economic matters. Shortly after the CEQ was created by NEPA, President Richard Nixon expanded its mandate in executive order 11514. He directed the CEQ to issue guidelines for the proper preparation of an EIS and to assemble and coordinate federal programs related to environmental quality. The council was placed within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. It is composed of three members appointed by the President and subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

The CEQ has played a key part in the development of the EIS process. Its initial guidelines issued in 1971 required each federal department and agency to adopt its own guidelines consistent with those established by CEQ. These guidelines did not carry the status of formal agency regulations, but were often treated with similar deference in the court of law. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter by executive order 11991 authorized the CEQ to adopt regulations rather than simple guidelines on EIS preparation. However, the CEQ still had no authority to enforce these regulations.

The CEQ has prepared advisory documentation in the last several years explaining the general structure of NEPA and the nature of cumulative impacts, among other advisories. The CEQ also maintains a &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Guide to NEPA&quot; website as part of its ongoing duties. CEQ regulations call for agencies and other federal actors to integrate NEPA requirements with other planning obligations as early as possible in the process. This is to ensure that all decisions are influenced by and reflective of environmental values. It also avoids potential delays and conflicts that could arise from imposing these requirements later in the rule-making process. Section 102(2)(C), which is NEPA&#x27;s action-forcing provision, stipulates that with &quot;every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment&quot;, all federal agencies shall include &quot;a detailed statement by the responsible official ... on the environmental impact of the proposed action&quot;. This statement must specify all the details required for the EIS.

== Consequences for Violating the National Environmental Policy Act ==
Agencies that violate NEPA may suffer harms to their reputations that can jeopardize future funding opportunities. Because the CEQ does not have enforcement authority for their guidelines, alleged violations must generally go through the judicial system. These lawsuits can further harm the agencies by demanding money and resources from the federal government, and delay projects for years. Several large projects have been shut down or cancelled as a result of such delays, like the planned Keystone XL Pipeline. The expansion was abandoned by TC Energy in 2021 after delays including the rejection of its review under NEPA, in the case Indigenous Environmental Network v. U.S. Department of State. The most common consequence imposed by courts for violations of NEPA is a mandated repeat of whichever environmental review or report was found to have been insufficient.

== National Environmental Policy Act and environmental justice ==
The National Environmental Policy Act can affect environmental justice in different ways. It can promote environmental justice by requiring federal agencies to include minority and low-income populations in their NEPA-mandated environmental analyses. Executive Order #12898 (Feb. 11, 1994; Clinton administration) requires federal agencies that are complying with NEPA to consider environmental effects on human health, and economic and social effects, specifically within minority and low-income populations, which are disproportionately impacted by environmental detriment. Proposed federal actions must address &quot;significant and adverse environmental effects&quot; on minority and low-income populations.

It can also get in the way of environmental justice: In New York, congestion pricing is predicted to improve air quality, mass transit ridership, and bus service. However, it took four years to finish an environmental assessment of several thousand pages for the NEPA process, and the project was further delayed by litigation asserting that the environmental assessment was not sufficient. A wind farm meant to be built on Cape Cod was cancelled after sixteen years of NEPA-related litigation. Various transmission lines necessary to transition to clean energy have been cancelled due to NEPA-related litigation, as well as the Calico Solar project in the Mojave desert.

==Recent developments==

On August 15, 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13807, &quot;Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects.&quot; This executive order directs CEQ to use its &quot;authority to interpret NEPA to simplify and accelerate the NEPA review process&quot;, requires agencies to &quot;establish procedures for a regular review and update of categorical exclusions&quot;, and revokes President Obama&#x27;s Executive Order 13690 addressing Flood Risk Management by including science on climate change.

In July 2020, the Trump administration CEQ moved to significantly weaken the law by issuing a final rule that limited the duration of EAs to one year and EISs to two years. The rule also exempted a number of projects from review entirely and prevented the consideration of cumulative environmental impacts, including those caused by climate change. Later, the Biden administration CEQ issued two changes to restore regulatory provisions that were in effect prior to the first Trump administration: Phase 1 Final Rule (April 20, 2022) and Phase 2 Final Rule (May 1, 2024).

<doc id="531846" wikidata="Q1820298" url="?curid=531846" title="Lerner and Loewe">
<text>Lerner and Loewe is the partnership between lyricist and librettist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe. Spanning three decades and nine musicals from 1942 to 1960 and again from 1970 to 1972, the pair are known for being behind the creation of critical on stage successes such as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, and &quot;Camelot&quot; along with the musical film &quot;Gigi&quot;.

==Background and previous work==
Growing up in Austria, Frederick or &quot;Fritz&quot; Loewe was a child prodigy concert pianist and son to a Viennese Operetta star, Edmond Loewe. After moving to New York City, he worked as a pianist in German clubs and was accompanist for silent films but never had a partnership before working with Lerner.
Conversely, Alan Lerner was born in New York City and attended Harvard where his first musical theater contributions came from working on collegiate Hasty Pudding musicals. Early in his career at Harvard he collaborated with Leonard Bernstein but also did not have any official partnerships until he crossed paths with Loewe.

==Meeting==
In August 1942 at the Lambs Club in New York City 24 year old American, Alan Jay Lerner and 41 year old Austrian, Frederick Loewe, officially met each other. As recounted by Lerner, the two met by chance when Loewe took a wrong turn on his way to the bathroom. Loewe asked Lerner if he wrote lyrics and upon affirmation, Loewe asked if he wanted to write with him. The two began working together immediately afterward.

==Early work==

While the two were quick to work with each other, the initial two musicals Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe worked on were not a commercial success and would be heavily regarded today as &quot;flops.&quot; 
The very first of their collaborations, &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, was worked on in 1942 at a stock company in Detroit, ran for 9 weeks and never made it to a Broadway stage. The first of their productions to make it to Broadway was &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot;, which received generally (if mildly) favorable reviews but was not a commercial success. Lerner later wrote that the musical ran for only one week before closing, but it in fact ran from November 11, 1943, to January 4, 1944, closing after 63 performances.

The pair achieved some small success in 1945 with &quot;The Day Before Spring&quot;. This production opened at the National Theatre in late November and closed approximately one year later in April 1946. Despite the short run, a &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine critic gave the musical a favorable review from its opening at the Shubert Theatre in Boston and deemed Lerner and Loewe &quot;potential supermen.&quot;

===&quot;Brigadoon&quot;===

&quot;Brigadoon&quot; was the pair&#x27;s first significant hit. Loewe and Lerner reportedly auditioned their music fifty times before successfully finding investors to help mount their production.
&quot;Brigadoon&quot;&#x27;s plot centers on two New York natives who are visiting the highlands of Scotland. While there, they happen upon a village that is enchanted by magic to appear only once every century. The material was said to be inspired by the stories of James M. Barrie and also a direct quote from Frederick Loewe: &quot;faith can move mountains.&quot; The original Broadway production opened in 1947 at the Ziegfeld Theatre and won the Drama Critics Award for Best Musical of the Year. In 1949 &quot;Brigadoon&quot; opened at the West End Theatre in London. It has been revived successfully several times. A film starring Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse was also made.

===&quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;===

Regarded by the duo as a &quot;success, but not a hit&quot;, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; opened in 1951 at the Shubert Theatre to mixed reviews. The story takes place in California during the Gold Rush and focuses on the relationship between a father who works as a miner and his daughter.
Two years after its New York opening, the musical made its West End debut in 1953 and ran for nearly 500 performances.
Years later, in 1969, Lerner asked Loewe to return to the project to specifically write new songs for the film version. Loewe, who had since retired, declined, but gave Lerner permission to collaborate with Andre Previn for the additional songs. The one rule Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe abided by for the entirety of their partnership was that if one wished to work with another lyricist or composer, he must tell the other; this also applied for any time someone requested to work with either one of them. While Lerner received permission and created new songs with Previn specifically for the film, the reception of the movie musical was predominantly negative. The most popular songs from this musical were written in its earliest stages with both Lerner and Loewe at the helm, including &quot;I Was Born Under a Wand&#x27;rin&#x27; Star&quot;, &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot; and &quot;I Talk To The Trees.&quot;

===&quot;My Fair Lady&quot;===

&quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. While both Lerner and Loewe were interested in adapting George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; into a musical, early on in the process they struggled significantly with creating a musical that would fit the musical constructs in place at the time, i.e. a flashy chorus and large ballet sequences.
After many frustrated work sessions and the input of Oscar Hammerstein, who had also tried to adapt the play with Richard Rodgers and failed, Lerner and Loewe abandoned the project.

During their break from what would be regarded by many as their most successful musical, Lerner concentrated his efforts on a musical based on the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic, but was one day reminded of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; when he came across news of the passing of Gabriel Pascal, the film producer who had brought the opportunity to the duo in the first place.

After reevaluating the state of the musical theater &quot;rules&quot;—or, rather, the new lack of them—and determining that it was no longer necessary to have a subplot or a larger-than-life ensemble, in 1954 both Lerner and Loewe resumed the project and continued their efforts on the adaptation.

The main goal of Lerner and Loewe was not simply to do justice to the original text, but to create the right songs to emphasize character. It took many failed attempts, tossing out unneeded songs and long hours at the piano before coming across the style they both wished to utilize, the dramatization of characters&#x27; inner turmoil. It was during work on this musical that Lerner and Loewe spent the most time perfecting songs. This came not just from playing music at the piano, but of talking out moments in the musical and what they both wanted to achieve from these moments.

Lerner has said of Loewe&#x27;s style that, when they were at the piano, he would often enter dreamlike states where he would continuously play until a musical moment appeared that they were both overjoyed with.

It wasn&#x27;t until the tail end of the process, with previews looming, that Lerner and Loewe finally decided on a name for the musical. Loewe&#x27;s vote was for &quot;Fanfaroon,&quot; but Lerner believed that bore too close a resemblance to &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. He, along with the rest of the creative team, decided that out of all their options, they disliked &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; the least.

The year it opened &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; won 6 of the 10 Tony Awards for which it was nominated and also won the Theatre World Award for Outstanding New York City Stage Debut Performance. During the time it played it set the record for the longest running Broadway musical, and has had numerous revivals since the original production.

===&quot;Gigi&quot;===

Four years after &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened, Lerner sought to collaborate with Loewe on a film. Due to it being outside of stage work, Loewe at first passed on the opportunity, but relented after reading the script.

While in Paris preparing to shoot, Lerner, being more likely to make impulsive decisions, bought a blue Rolls-Royce and convinced Loewe to buy a grey one in an exchange that lasted less than five minutes at the car dealership. The very first film preview of &quot;Gigi&quot; was not well-received, and it was a combination of the reactions and Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s own unhappiness with the film that led them to rewrite and re-shoot it, costing them $300,000.

However, these changes were well-received and &quot;Gigi&quot; won nine Academy Awards, at that time holding the record for the most Oscars won by a single film production.

===&quot;Camelot&quot;===
Much like &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, inspiration for &quot;Camelot&quot; came to Lerner from a book, this time, T.H White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. Loewe had to be more strongly convinced of its commercial appeal, but ultimately was won over.

&quot;Camelot&quot; was an immensely difficult production for the duo, with the opening preview running four and a half hours and the director, Moss Hart, hospitalized with a heart attack in the middle of previews, forcing Lerner to take over as director and causing tension between Lerner and Loewe. While it was at first difficult to gain the traction they were looking for, the cast&#x27;s appearance on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; brought the production great success and ended up resulting in &quot;Camelot&#x27;s&quot; total profits grossing over seven figures. 

Loewe had previously stated to Lerner that &quot;Camelot&quot; would be his final show before his retirement and, true to his word, he parted ways with Lerner.

==Working relationship and personalities==
One element Lerner stated was instrumental to his partnership with Loewe was Loewe&#x27;s patience. Lerner&#x27;s creative process could take as little as a few hours, and as much as a few weeks, yet he never felt pressured nor shamed by his counterpart. While Loewe did not require as long periods of time to compose his music as Lerner required to write lyrics, he could often be very uncertain in his choices and Lerner was able to provide him with reassurance.

The two were also partial to working in the early morning, particularly Lerner, who believed all his best writing was done as soon as he awakened.

In terms of personality, the two could not be more opposite. Lerner, the younger of the two who was raised in New York, always had an eagerness about him and was quick speaking and moving. Loewe, the older of the two who was brought up in Austria, was more experienced and cynical. However, each understood the other and they developed a very deep friendship.

==Final collaboration==

Their final collaboration was on the 1974 musical film &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. The &quot;All Movie&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;Although Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe crafted a hummable and entertaining score, it is not among their best work; worse, its tone and style are frequently at odds with the story.&quot;

Lerner said this of Loewe:
&quot;There will never be another Fritz... Writing will never again be as much fun. A collaboration as intense as ours inescapably had to be complex. But I loved him more than I understood or misunderstood him and I know he loved me more than he understood or misunderstood me.&quot;In &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary for Loewe, it was written: &quot;Near the creative peak of their collaboration, Mr. Lerner characterized his working relationship with Mr. Loewe as pleasant and respectful.&quot;

<text>Ali Ardeshir Larijani (, ; born 3 June 1958) is an Iranian politician and former military officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who served as the Speaker of the Parliament of Iran from 2008 to 2020. He has been a member of the Expediency Discernment Council since 2020, having previously served from 1997 to 2008. Larijani filed for candidacy in the 2024 presidential election, but was ultimately disqualified. He previously ran in 2005, but was disqualified from running in 2021.

Larijani was the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council from 15 August 2005 to 20 October 2007, appointed to the position by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, replacing Hassan Rouhani. Acceptance of Larijani&#x27;s resignation from the secretary position was announced on 20 October 2007 by Gholam-Hossein Elham, the Iranian government&#x27;s spokesman, mentioning that President Ahmadinejad turned down his previous resignations.

Larijani was one of the two representatives of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ali Khamenei to the council, the other being Hassan Rouhani. In his post as secretary, he effectively functioned as the top negotiator on issues of national security, including Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. He is also the current member of Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution.

==Early life==
Ali Larijani was born in Najaf, Iraq to Iranian Persian parents. He hails from a religious Shia gentry family based in Amol in the province of Mazandaran. His father was a leading cleric, Ayatollah Mirza Hashem Amoli. His parents moved to Najaf in 1931 due to pressure of the ruler Reza Shah, but returned to Iran in 1961.
===Education===
Larijani is a graduate of Qom seminary. He also holds a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and mathematics from Aryamehr University of Technology and holds a master&#x27;s degree and PhD in Western philosophy from the University of Tehran. Initially, he wanted to continue his graduate studies in computer science, but changed his subject after consultation with Morteza Motahhari. Larijani has published books on Immanuel Kant, Saul Kripke, and David Lewis. Larijani is a faculty member of the School of Literature and Humanities at the University of Tehran.

==Career==
Larijani is a former commander of the Revolutionary Guards. Larijani served as the deputy minister of labor and social affairs. Then it was appointed deputy minister of information and communications technology. In March 1994, he was appointed as head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, replacing Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani in the post. He was in office until 21 July 2004 and was succeeded by Ezzatollah Zarghami after serving ten years in the post. He became security adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in August 2004.

Larijani was a presidential candidate for the 2005 presidential elections, where he ranked sixth, winning 5.94% of the votes. He was considered the most important presidential candidate of the conservative alliance for the 2005 presidential elections. He was supported by the Islamic Society of Engineers (ISE), among other conservative groups. He had been announced as the final choice of the conservative &quot;Council for Coordination of the Forces of the Revolution&quot;, made from representatives of some influential conservative parties and organizations. However, he proved to be the least popular of the three conservative candidates, the others being Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (second rank in the first round, winner in the second round) and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf (fourth rank in the first round).

In 2005, Larijani was appointed the Supreme National Security Council secretary. This body helps draw up nuclear and other policies by Khamenei. He replaced Hassan Rouhani in the post. As a chief nuclear negotiator, Iranian analysts said he differed with the president over how to pursue negotiations with his European counterparts and say he backed a more pragmatic approach.

As Iran&#x27;s top nuclear envoy, Larijani said on 25 April 2007 that he expected &quot;new ideas&quot; from senior EU official Javier Solana at talks on resolving the deadlock between Tehran&#x27;s refusal to freeze its nuclear programme and United Nations Security Council demands that it do so.

In the March 2008 parliamentary election, Larijani won a seat from Qom. He said he was willing to work with Ahmadinejad; according to Larijani, he did not disagree with Ahmadinejad on ideological issues and had only &quot;differences in style&quot;. In May 2008, Larijani became speaker of the parliament. He was reelected in the next year as chairman of the parliament. He was re-elected in 2012 elections as the Qom district&#x27;s high-receiving candidate. He was also elected for another term as chairman of the parliament on 5 June 2012 and was sworn in on 11 June 2012.

Larijani implied on 21 June 2009 that authorities took the side of one candidate without clarifying which candidate.
Just after the election, Larijani reportedly congratulated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi as he, having &quot;access to firsthand and classified information and news&quot;, believed Mousavi had won the election. However, on 22 October 2012, during a QA meeting with the students of Iran University of Science and Technology, Larijani denied the allegations that he had congratulated Mousavi. He was elected as speaker in the new Majlis in May 2016.

In May 2021, Larijani declared his bid for the presidency in the 2021 Iranian presidential election. However, the vetting Guardian Council, in a decision that astounded both the conservatives and reformists, disqualified him from running. Considering Larijani&#x27;s long career as an Islamic Republic insider who has been part of the top echelons of power since the 1979 revolution, his disqualification was a possibility even his staunch detractors couldn&#x27;t envision. The Guardian Council did not announce the reason for barring him.

In May 2024, Larijani submitted his application for his candidacy for the president in the 2024 Iranian presidential election.

== Affiliation ==
Larijani was considered to maintain Motalefeh membership and views while in Hashemi Rafsanjani cabinet (1992–1994). Iranian scholar Mehdi Moslem in his 2002 book named Factional Politics in Post-Khomeini Iran, suggests that Larijani had been a member of Motalefeh and part of the ‘traditional right’. Payam Mohseni, a fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, classifies Larijani as a lead figure in the ‘theocratic right’ camp, whose other prominent are Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi and Mohammad Reza Mahdavi Kani.

Larijani was one of the leaders of the Principlists Pervasive Coalition in 2008 parliamentary elections, and a United Front of Principlists leader. During Iranian 2016 parliamentary election Larijani was the leader of the Followers of Wilayat faction, although he was backed by the reformist List of Hope and said he is running as an independent candidate.

He is also described as a center-right politician who has &quot;slowly distanced himself from the Principlist camp&quot; and a &quot;conservative-turned-moderate&quot;.

Larijani is known to have close associates, including the interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, Behrouz Nemati, spokesman for the parliament&#x27;s presiding board, and Kazem Jalali, head of the parliament&#x27;s research center.

== Electoral history ==

==Public image==
According to a poll conducted in March 2016 by &quot;Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC&quot; (iPOS) among Iranian citizens, Larijani has 45% approval and 34% disapproval ratings and thus a +11% net popularity, while 11% of voters do not recognize the name.

==Personal life==
Larijani is a brother of Sadegh Larijani (President of the Judicature), Mohammad-Javad Larijani, Bagher Larijani (Faculty Member of Tehran University of Medical Sciences), and Fazel Larijani (Iran&#x27;s former cultural attachée in Ottawa). Larijani is also a cousin of Ahmad Tavakkoli (Larijani&#x27;s and Tavakkoli&#x27;s mothers are sisters). Larijani is the son-in-law of Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari, His daughter, Fatemeh Ardeshir-Larijani, studies at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in the United States.

On 2 April 2020, Larijani tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and was placed in quarantine.

<text>Giuditta Angiola Maria Costanza Pasta (; 26 October 1797 – 1 April 1865) was an Italian opera singer. A soprano, she has been compared to the 20th-century soprano Maria Callas.

==Career==
===Early career===
Pasta was born Giuditta Angiola Maria Costanza Negri in Saronno, near Milan, on 26 October 1797. She was born of the Negri family, who came from Lomazzo, where the family practiced medical art. Her father, Carlo Antonio Negri or Schwarz, was Jewish and a soldier in the Napoleonic Army. She studied in Milan with Giuseppe Scappa and Davide Banderali, and later with Girolamo Crescentini and Ferdinando Paer among others. In 1816, she married fellow singer Giuseppe Pasta and took his surname as her own. She made her professional opera début in the world première of Scappa&#x27;s &quot;Le tre Eleonore&quot; in Milan that same year. Later that year she performed at the Théâtre Italien in Paris as Donna Elvira in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Giulietta in Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli&#x27;s &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot;, and in two operas by Paer.

Pasta&#x27;s first appearance in London in 1817 was a failure. Further studies with Scappa were followed by a successful debut in Venice in 1819. She caused a sensation in Paris in 1821–22, in the role of Desdemona in Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;Otello&quot;.
===Roles written specifically for Pasta===

She sang regularly in London, Paris, Milan and Naples between 1824 and 1837. In Milan she created three roles which were written for her voice. They were the title role of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; given at the Teatro Carcano in 1830 (which was that composer&#x27;s greatest success at that time), the Amina in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot; and the protagonist&#x27;s part of his &quot;Norma&quot; (both in 1831), which became three of her major successes. Stendhal had argued persuasively in 1824 for the necessity of a score composed expressly for Pasta.

===Later career===
Pasta retired from the stage in 1835 and performed only infrequently after that date (including performances in London in 1837 and in Germany and Russia in 1840–1841.)

Pasta later taught singing in Italy. Among her notable pupils were contralto Emma Albertazzi and soprano Marianna Barbieri-Nini and the English soprano Adelaide Kemble. Another pupil was Carolina Ferni, herself a noted Norma, who in her turn taught the soprano Eugenia Burzio whose recordings are known for their passionate expression.

Pasta died in Blevio, a town in the province of Como on 1 April 1865, at the age of 67.

==Pasta&#x27;s voice==
Giuditta Pasta&#x27;s voice was described by a &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; reviewer in 1824 as follows:

:It is a mezzo-soprano, somewhat similar to that of Madame Vestris, but clearer, more powerful, and of greater compass. She commands two octaves, but two or three of the highest notes of this range are forced, and not agreeable. Her middle tones are fine and full-bodied; but, occasionally, notes escape in the lowest half octave, which are husky and harsh. In point of cultivation and science, she possesses, first of all, the rare merit of a pure intonation. We have not heard her once out of tune.

Her voice type was what could be called a soprano sfogato. It was described by Stendhal as follows:
:She can achieve perfect resonance on a note as low as bottom A, and can rise as high as C, or even to a slightly sharpened D; and she possesses the rare ability to be able to sing contralto as easily as she can sing soprano. I would suggest ... that the true designation of her voice is mezzo-soprano, and any composer who writes for her should use the mezzo-soprano range for the thematic material of his music, while still exploiting, as it were incidentally and from time to time, notes which lie within the more peripheral areas of this remarkably rich voice. Many notes of this last category are not only extremely fine in themselves, but have the ability to produce a kind of resonant and magnetic vibration, which, through some still unexplained combination of physical phenomena, exercises an instantaneous and hypnotic effect upon the soul of the spectator.

:This leads to the consideration of one of the most uncommon features of Madame Pasta&#x27;s voice: it is not all moulded from the same metallo, as it is said in Italy (which is to say that it possesses more than one timbre); and this fundamental variety of tone produced by a single voice affords one of the richest veins of musical expression which the artistry of a great cantatrice is able to exploit.

In 1829 named &quot;cantante delle passioni&quot; by Carlo Ritorni, one of the most erudite critics of the period, he described her as such because her voice was directed &quot;towards expressing the most intense passions, accompanying it with expressions of physical action, unknown before her in the lyric theatre&quot;.

In modern times Susan Rutherford has made a specific comparison with Callas:
: For the impact of corporeality on vocal timbre and delivery, and in the absence of Pasta&#x27;s own explanations of its effect, we might turn to another distinctive &quot;attrice cantante&quot; (and one who sang much of Pasta&#x27;s repertory) from a quite different period, Maria Callas. She also argued that gesture and facial expression must precede word in order to create the appropriate vehicle.

:It isn&#x27;t merely fame that makes Pasta interesting:... Pasta&#x27;s singularity is measured rather by the tone and extent of the debates her celebrity provoked, by her influence on the operatic stage, and by the timing of her career at the transition from Rossinian opera to the works of Bellini and Donizetti (with all the stylistic ramifications this implied). No other singer during that period attracted as much intellectual discussion, or was regarded as of such significance in the articulation of theories around operatic practices. For such reasons alone, Pasta is deserving of critical attention.
