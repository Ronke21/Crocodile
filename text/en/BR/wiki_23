<text>Eraserheads (sometimes stylized as ƎRASERHEADS or ƎRASƎRHƎADS) is a Filipino rock band formed in Quezon City in 1989. The band is composed of lead singer and primary songwriter Ely Buendia, guitarist Marcus Adoro, bassist Buddy Zabala, and drummer Raimund Marasigan. Regarded as “the Beatles of the Philippines”, the band is considered as one of the most influential and successful bands in the country.

The band released their debut album, &quot;Ultraelectromagneticpop!&quot;, in 1993, to critical acclaim and strong sales. Followed by &quot;Circus&quot; (1994) and &quot;Cutterpillow&quot; (1995), the band ushered in a second wave of Philippine rock bands in the 1990s. They also received MTV Asia’s Viewers Choice Award at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City, the only Philippine artist to have received the award before the conception of the MTV Asia Awards.

After releasing the Christmas concept album &quot;Fruitcake&quot; (1996), Eraserheads experimented with electronic and art rock styles for their next albums &quot;Sticker Happy&quot; (1997), &quot;Natin99&quot; (1999), and &quot;Carbon Stereoxide&quot; (2001). The band broke up in 2002, and all principal former members have enjoyed success as solo artists. They later reunited in 2008 for a series of reunion concerts in the Philippines and have since made sporadic touring and promotional appearances in the country and overseas.

== History ==

=== 1989–1992: Formation and early years ===

The members of Eraserheads met while attending University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City in 1989. Vocalist Ely Buendia previously had two college bands, Bluidie Tryste and Sunday School, and was a year above drummer Raimund Marasigan (also a session drummer for Sunday School), bassist Buddy Zabala, and guitarist Marcus Adoro; the three were part of another college band named Curfew. Ely posted an audition notice for a new band on a university message board, of which only Raimund, Buddy, and Marcus showed up. The new band called themselves Eraserheads after the David Lynch film &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977).

The band played at campus events, usually as the crowd started to leave. They later met Jett Pangan of The Dawn at a sorority event, who advised them to audition. On January 26, 1991, the band recorded a nine-song demo tape at Marasigan&#x27;s garage in Candelaria, Quezon. The demos were said to be influenced by The Cure as well as ska and reggae genres. The band shopped the demo tape around record labels, clubs, and radio stations only to be met with rejection; one record label commented that the demos were “not pop enough”. Marasigan gave a copy of the demo tape to his humanities professor Robin Rivera, who helped them re-record and mix better versions of the demos. The new demo tape was named &quot;Pop-U!&quot; as an irreverent response to those who turned them down.

&quot;Pop-U!&quot; earned the band a spot at Club Dredd, where they initially had little success playing covers. They decided to write their own material which soon earned them a cult following. One song, &quot;Pare Ko&quot;, became popular for its explicit lyrics. The band soon landed an out-of-town gig opening for Introvoys in Cebu.

Meanwhile, Buendia worked as an copywriter for BMG and wrote songs with the band at night. Their material later caught the attention of BMG A&amp;R director Vic Valenciano, who commented that they were technically very raw but that there was something promising in them. In 1992, BMG signed the band into a three-year record deal.

=== 1993–1996: Mainstream success ===
Eraserheads recorded their debut album, &quot;Ultraelectromagneticpop!&quot;, in early 1993, with some of the tracks rerecorded from &quot;Pop-U!&quot; First released by BMG in July, the album became a commercial success, selling 300,000 copies by the end of the year. “Pare Ko” became controversial for its explicit lyrics, with the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) unsuccessfully attempting to censor it. As a result, the album featured both the original and censored versions, with the latter titled “Walang Hiyang Pare Ko” (later excluded from the album’s 25th anniversary remaster).

The band performed at the 43rd Miss Universe pageant held at the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay City in May 1994. Later in November, they held their first major concert titled &quot;Eraserheads Jamboree&quot; at the Folk Arts Theater (now the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas) in Malate, Manila. They also released their second album &quot;Circus&quot; in the same month. It also became a commercial success, eventually turning quintuple platinum. Some of its tracks became classic hits for the band, such as &quot;Kailan&quot;, &quot;Minsan&quot;, &quot;Magasin&quot;, &quot;Alapaap&quot; and &quot;With a Smile&quot;. &quot;Alapaap&quot; became controversial for its suggestive lyrics, which Senator Tito Sotto interpreted as promoting drug use. The band denied the allegation, stating that it was a misinterpretation and that the song was the band&#x27;s &quot;ode to freedom&quot;, not drug abuse.

In July 1995, the band starred as themselves opposite Joey de Leon in the comedy film &quot;Run Barbi Run&quot;, also contributing to its theme song. Later in December, the band launched their third studio album &quot;Cutterpillow&quot; through a free open-air concert. It became their fastest-selling record, earning double platinum after one week with 80,000 copies. The album featured classic hits such as &quot;Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Huwag Mo Nang Itanong&quot;, &quot;Torpedo&quot; and &quot;Ang Huling El Bimbo&quot;, of which a music video directed by Auraeus Solito premiered in February 1996. After the release of &quot;Cutterpillow&quot;, the band went on a nationwide tour to promote the album.

In January 1996, the band opened for Sonic Youth, Foo Fighters and Beastie Boys for MTV Asia&#x27;s Alternative Nation tour in Manila. Later in December, they released their fourth studio album &quot;Fruitcake&quot;, a Christmas concept album with all songs written in English. Like their previous albums, it became a commercial success, earning triple platinum after a month with 120,000 copies sold. It was followed by a companion storybook released the following year.

=== 1997–2002: Later years and break-up ===
==== Going international ====
The band started touring outside the Philippines in 1997, first performing at BMG Records&#x27; Sentosa Pop Festival in Singapore in March. They made their American debut in May, playing several venues in California. In September, they received the MTV Asia&#x27;s Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award for the &quot;Ang Huling El Bimbo&quot; video at the MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, making them the first Philippine artist to receive such a distinction.

The band released their fifth studio album &quot;Sticker Happy&quot; in the same month. It also became a commercial success, selling 120,000 copies. The album saw the band experimenting with techno and experimental rock genres, incorporating a wide range of instruments and guitar effects, with Buendia writing cryptic lyrics in songs such as “Kaliwete”, “Spoliarium”, and “Para sa Masa”.

In February 1998, the band represented the Philippines at the Asia Live Dream &#x27;98 for NHK in Tokyo, Japan. They later toured the US to promote &quot;Sticker Happy&quot; under the Happy Box production outfit. In August, the band released the compilation album &quot;Aloha Milkyway&quot; for the Southeast Asian market, featuring five new songs including &quot;Julie Tearjerky&quot; and &quot;Tamagotchi Baby&quot; as well as select English language tracks from their previous albums. They later toured in Singapore in September and in Australia in April 1999 to promote the record.

The band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Natin99&quot;, in May 1999. Recorded in a nonlinear approach, the album featured significant contributions from members other than Buendia, who wrote the promotional singles &quot;Maselang Bahaghari&quot; and &quot;Huwag Kang Matakot&quot;. In November, the band performed at Dubai, United Arab Emirates with rapper Francis M.

In January 2000, the band performed with APO Hiking Society at Nescafé&#x27;s Open Up Party at Bonifacio Global City. They later toured the US between May and June 2000, playing venues in New York, Chicago, and California. The band released their seventh and final studio album &quot;Carbon Stereoxide&quot; in March 2001.

==== Buendia&#x27;s departure, new vocalist and break-up ====
Buendia left Eraserheads in March 2002. In an interview, Adoro revealed that Buendia sent a cryptic text message to his band members that “it’s graduation time”, referring to him being a year ahead of them at UP. Buendia later recalled in a podcast interview in 2021: “We had a very, very good working relationship. It’s just that I don’t like it when people say that it was the wrong way to go, ‘yung dynamics within the band.”

The remaining three members later debuted with new vocalist, Kris Gorra-Dancel of Fatal Posporos, at Hard Rock Manila in April. Naming themselves “EHeads”, they released a promotional EP titled &quot;Please Transpose&quot; in August which featured the single “U Make Me”, of which a music video was directed by Marie Jamora. Adoro left the band in November, and the rest of the band recruited Ebe Dancel of Sugarfree and Diego Mapa of Monsterbot and renamed the band Cambio, ending the Eraserheads.

=== 2003–2007: After the break-up ===
The band received the Hall of Fame award at the NU Rock Awards X in November 2003. Buendia, who also performed at the awards show with his band the Mongols, accepted the award. In May 2004, Adoro (as Surfernando) jammed with Zabala and Marasigan at the Millennia Club in UP.

In 2005, the first Eraserheads tribute album &quot;Ultraelectromagneticjam!: The Music of the Eraserheads&quot; was released. “I don’t have a problem with that,” Buendia reacted to the release. “I just feel it’s not yet the right time to do such tribute because I’m still doing something worthwhile.” He appears in the album through Francis M.’s re-recording of “Superproxy” titled “Superproxy 2K6”.

In February 2007, the essay anthology book, &quot;Tikman ng Langit: An Anthology on the Eraserheads&quot;, was launched at Makati with acoustic performances from Cambio and Adoro’s band Markus Highway, marking the first time members of the Eraserheads performed together since their break-up. Buendia was not able to attend due to a meeting with his heart surgeon. In July 2007, the band were listed as performers with Teeth, Rivermaya, and Parokya ni Edgar for a live show at the Saguijo Bar in Makati. However, Buendia and Adoro did not show up as they had separate engagements.

=== 2008–present: Reunions ===
==== 2008–2009: &quot;The Reunion Concert&quot; and The Final Set ====
In July 2008, the band confirmed they would reunite for a concert at the CCP Open Grounds on August 30. Initially sponsored by Philip Morris, the company later backed out after facing criminal charges by the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) for violating the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003 prohibiting tobacco companies from sponsoring artistic events; they had also promised a free but invitation-only show for adults and smokers. The concert was later sponsored by Radiohead Productions with tickets being sold and the venue moved to the Bonifacio Global City Open Grounds in Taguig.

The band went ahead with the reunion concert as planned, with Jazz Nicolas of Itchyworms joining in as session musician. However, it was cut short due to Buendia being rushed to Makati Medical Center after experiencing chest pains. The remaining band members went to Saguijo and played what would have been the second set of the concert, with Ebe Dancel on vocals. Buendia later recovered after an angioplasty. The concert was later released as a in November, with an also released in theaters.

In January 2009, the band announced a second reunion concert to be produced by MTV Philippines. Called The Final Set, the sold-out concert was held at the SM Mall of Asia concert grounds in Pasay City on March 7, with an estimated 100,000 people in attendance. The band also paid tribute to Francis M., who had died of leukemia the previous day and was slated to be a guest performer. The concert was later aired on GMA Network as a TV special in April. In February 2009, the band received the MYX Magna Award, which was accepted by Marasigan.

==== 2010s: International tours, &quot;Sabado/1995&quot; ====
The band embarked on a North American reunion tour in 2012, playing venues in California, Jersey City, and Toronto. They also performed at Dubai in two separate occasions, as well as Singapore in 2013 and London in April 2014.

In 2012, Star Music released the second Eraserheads tribute album as a soundtrack to the Star Cinema film &quot;The Reunion&quot;, titled &quot;The Reunion: An Eraserheads Tribute Album&quot;.

On September 2014, the band released two new songs, “Sabado” and “1995”, as part of the September issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. They also held a surprise performance at the magazine issue’s launch party in Makati.

On June 2016, the band reunited for a live performance at a rebranding launch event of PLDT and its subsidiary Smart Communications. They also appeared in a promotional campaign by Smart.

A musical adaptation of the band’s discography titled &quot;Ang Huling El Bimbo&quot; premiered in July 2018 at Resorts World Manila. Buendia approved of the musical: “I love the way they stitched all those songs together into one solid musical,&quot; he said.

Buendia&#x27;s record label Offshore Music reissued the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Ultraelectromagneticpop!&quot; and &quot;Circus&quot;, which were remastered by Bernie Grundman. They were later released on vinyl, as well as &quot;Cutterpillow&quot; in 2024. Meanwhile, Marasigan, Zabala, and Adoro formed the band Ultracombo in 2019. Adoro left the band shortly after.

==== 2020s: Huling El Bimbo world tour ====
In 2020, Noisemakers released a third Eraserheads tribute album, &quot;Pop Machine the Album&quot;, featuring covers by Lola Amour, Oh, Flamingo!, and Reese Lansangan.

On September 2022, the band announced a third reunion concert in the Philippines. Titled “Huling El Bimbo”, the reunion concert was held at the SMDC Festival Grounds in Parañaque City on December 22, 2022, with an estimated 75,000 people in attendance. The band played the album &quot;Cutterpillow&quot; in its entirety for the first set, saving “Ang Huling El Bimbo” for the last set while also performing with guest performers such as Gary Valenciano and a hologram of Francis M. The concert was later released as a live album to streaming services in March 2024.

The band embarked on a world tour in 2023 and 2024, playing venues in the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Dubai. Some of the concerts in 2024 featured guest musicians like Medwin Marfil of True Faith, former Rivermaya guitarist Perf de Castro, and Jay Contreras of Kamikazee. They are set to perform in Australia and New Zealand in 2025.

In November 2022, the band were honored as Artists of the Year by Esquire Philippines. They also returned to UP to receive the Gawad Oblation award in August 2024. Additionally, they headlined the UAAP Season 87 opening ceremony on September 2024.

A documentary titled &quot;Eraserheads: Combo on the Run&quot; is set to premiere in Philippine cinemas on March 2025, which tells the story of the band leading up to their 2022 reunion.

<text>Marisa Lee Miller (née Bertetta; born August 6, 1978) is an American model best known for her appearances in the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; and her work for Victoria&#x27;s Secret. After a stint shooting with photographer Mario Testino for fashion magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, Miller began working for both companies in 2002. In 2007, she became a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel, and appeared on the cover of the 2008 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue to record-setting numbers. Her accomplishments have led to her being dubbed the &quot;return of the great American supermodel.&quot;

She is known for contracts with companies such as Harley-Davidson, for whom she is the first spokesperson in the history of the company, and the NFL, for whom she became a spokesperson in 2010. Miller is considered a sex symbol; she ranked No. 1 on &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Hot 100&quot; list and in &quot;FHM&quot;″s global 2010 &quot;Sexiest Women in the World&quot; poll. Aside from modeling, she was an ambassador for both the American Cancer Society and the USO. Miller made her film debut in &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot; (2013).

==Early life==
Miller was born Marisa Lee Bertetta in Santa Cruz, California, to Krista (née Useldinger) and Marc Bertetta. She has two younger sisters. Miller attended high school at Aptos High and Monte Vista Christian School. She considered herself a tomboy growing up, with mostly male friends and little awareness of anything girly.
Out of shyness, she often wore large t-shirts to hide her body and would get fully dressed just to go to the trash-can while at the beach.

Miller was first &quot;discovered&quot; at age sixteen walking through a San Francisco café by two Italian modeling agents.
After talking to her mother, she was on a plane to Italy with her mother a few months later, despite her &quot;shy and conservative&quot; personality. During the 1990s, fashion modelling was going through a phase of the androgynous look, and Marisa thought herself too curvy and too short to fit that trend. Miller gained attention in 1997 when she appeared nude in the first issue of &quot;Perfect 10&quot; magazine. Although she came in third behind Ashley Degenford and Monica Hansen in &quot;Perfect 10&quot; magazine&#x27;s first annual model search, she was repeatedly showcased in following issues, including the covers of the Winter 1998 and August/September 1999 editions, 
as well as a reprint for the Fall 2004 edition cover.

==Career==
In 2001 Miller moved from a start as an amateur magazine model to high-profile mainstream work, after being introduced to fashion photographer Mario Testino, leading to editorials for both the American and Italian editions of &quot;Vogue&quot;. By 2002 Miller was working for Victoria&#x27;s Secret and appearing in the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue, in which she appeared in every issue from 2002 to 2008. In particular, she famously posed wearing only an iPod in the 2007 issue. She has appeared in a diverse range of magazines, many of them international editions, such as &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. She has appeared in advertisements for Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, Andrew Marc, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, J.Crew, Guess?, Nordstrom, Bath &amp; Body Works, and True Religion jeans.

It was not until 2007 that she filmed her first television commercial for Victoria&#x27;s Secret, appearing alongside Heidi Klum for the &quot;It&quot; bra.
On December 4, 2007, Miller made her debut in the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show, and opened a segment in the following year&#x27;s edition. Other runway work include 2007&#x27;s &quot;Fashion for Relief&quot; show, benefiting victims of Hurricane Katrina, as well as MTV&#x27;s &quot;Fashionably Loud&quot;, Imitation of Christ, Inca, and Amir Slama&#x27;s Rosa Cha, for which she was one of the most anticipated models.
In the February 12, 2008, episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, it was revealed via a three-story billboard in New York City that Miller would occupy the cover of that year&#x27;s &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue. The tandem online launch of the issue drew record page views to the SI website: 228 million, a 41% increase over 2007. In September 2008, Sports Illustrated released a &quot;Best of Marisa Miller&quot; swimsuit calendar for the 2009 year.

Victoria&#x27;s Secret put her to work in 2008, with a five-city tour to promote the 2008 &quot;Swim&quot; collection&#x27;s release in stores; the April–May tour included stops in New York City, Miami, Chicago (where she threw the opening pitch at a Chicago Cubs baseball game), Boston, and Minneapolis. The relaunch of Victoria&#x27;s Secret sports line, &quot;VSX&quot;, soon followed, along with her first official campaign as an Angel: promoting the company&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Very Sexy Dare&quot;.
For the 2009 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show, Miller was chosen to wear the year&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy Bra&quot;, a harlequin design featuring 2,300 white, champagne, and cognac diamonds, and a 16-carat heart-shaped brown-yellow diamond pendant for a $3-million value and 150 total carats.
In response to claims that Miller had parted with Victoria&#x27;s Secret in January 2010, the Chief Marketing Officer for Limited Brands responded, saying the claims were &quot;unfounded and untrue&quot; while adding &quot;we adore Marisa and we will continue to work with her in the future.&quot; In late 2010, Miller confirmed she had moved on to other projects.

===Beyond modeling===

In a July 2010 interview with &quot;Forbes&quot;, Miller explained her shift in focus from modelling to becoming a celebrity brand herself. For that reason, she moved to promoting consumer products in line with her own brand and personality. In July 2008, Miller launched a line of shoes she had developed with skateboarder/surfer-oriented company Vans . Miller starred in a 2008 viral video on YouTube with All Star baseball player Ryan Braun for Remington&#x27;s ShortCut hair clippers.

In 2008, Miller became the first spokesperson in motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson&#x27;s one-hundred-year history. She first partnered with Harley to launch the VRSCF V-Rod Muscle motorcycle and rejoined the company in November 2009 to act as the face of their first &quot;Military Appreciation Month&quot; campaign, featuring Miller as a classic pin-up in military-themed advertisements and online content. 2010 found her again working for the company, this time for their &quot;Start Something&quot; campaign, encouraging dreamers to become new riders.
Miller represented the rum brand Captain Morgan as the company&#x27;s &quot;Official First Mate&quot; in advertising, social responsibility communication, and event appearances, starting in 2010.

In October 2010, the NFL announced Miller had been hired as a spokesperson for the 2010-2011 season, with duties including hosting the NFL International Series game between the San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos in London. The announcement drew accusations toward the league of sending a &quot;mixed message&quot; in hiring a well-known lingerie and swimsuit model on the heels of controversies over reporter Ines Sainz&#x27;s treatment at the New York Jets&#x27; facilities and the messages and photos Brett Favre allegedly sent Jenn Sterger. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist William C. Rhoden noted that &quot;Miller reveals a lot of flesh in the N.F.L. advertisements featuring her. This is Miller&#x27;s business, but it shouldn&#x27;t be the N.F.L.&#x27;s.&quot;
In 2010, she designed and released a paddle board line with Surftech aimed at female riders and in 2012 she appeared in a beach-theme commercial for Buick.

Miller&#x27;s first work in television was as a judge on the Bravo reality series &quot;Manhunt: The Search for America&#x27;s Most Gorgeous Male Model&quot; in 2004, the same year she appeared in Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s &quot;Spin You Around&quot; music video. 2007 brought appearances in the pilot episode and finale of the VH1 reality show &quot;The Shot&quot; and cameos in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot; and the CBS comedy &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, the latter with her fellow Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angels. In 2009, she had a guest judge role on an episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; and a minor role in an episode of &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot;; in 2010, she co-hosted an episode of &quot;GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley&quot;.
She has appeared in commercials for the NFL Network and the California Travel and Tourism Commission&#x27;s &quot;Visit California&quot; campaign. Miller&#x27;s 2008 commercial for Activision&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero: World Tour&quot;, was deemed too sexy to air. The advert was part of a campaign featuring various celebrities, and was based on the famous scene from &quot;Risky Business&quot; where Tom Cruise dances to Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; in a shirt and underwear.

Miller&#x27;s first film role was in &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot; (2013), with Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges.

==Media recognition==
The swell in publicity resulting from her 2008 work served to land Miller in the number one spot on &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Hot 100&quot; rankings for 2008, beating out list regulars such as Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Biel, and Eva Longoria. This marked the first time anyone has debuted on the list in the number one position.
In her subsequent cover story for the July issue, &quot;Maxim&quot; proclaimed her as the &quot;return of the great American supermodel.&quot; Of such acclaim, Miller admits, &quot;I get a kick out of it, but it would be stupid to let it go to my head. It&#x27;s modeling—I didn&#x27;t find the cure for cancer.&quot; Miller continued to be highly rated and appeared on the list in 2009 in 18th place, and in 2010 in 10th place.

She also finished first place in &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; &quot;Smokin&#x27; Sixteen&quot; competition in 2008, repeating her 2007 win over competitors such as Gisele Bündchen and Adriana Lima. Miller ranked second in AskMen.com&#x27;s &quot;Top 99&quot; for 2010, after ranking third in 2009, ninth in 2008, twelfth in 2007, and fourteenth in 2006. She added to her popular accolades with the &quot;Hot N&#x27; Fresh&quot; award at the second annual Spike Guys&#x27; Choice Awards.

In 2010, Miller came in third in &quot;FHM&quot; magazine&#x27;s UK edition of the 16th annual &quot;Sexiest Women in the World&quot; poll, placing behind actress Megan Fox and winner, British singer Cheryl Cole.
Miller topped the poll in the US edition of &quot;FHM&quot; and was declared the global winner of the poll, receiving the most combined votes from &quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s 24 international editions.

==Personal life==
She married Jim Miller, a Los Angeles surfing contest promoter and lifeguard from California, in 2000. The couple separated in 2002; they divorced soon after. Following the divorce, Marisa continued using the surname Miller. She married music producer Griffin Guess on April 15, 2006. Miller gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a son, on December 13, 2012. She gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second son on May 29, 2015.

From an early age she loved surfing, and her aunt was on the pro tour. In 2004, she placed second in the celebrity division of the Kelly Slater Surf Invitational and says of the sport, &quot;I feel my absolute best—physically, mentally and spiritually—when I&#x27;m surfing every day.&quot; She also won the most valuable player award at the 4th annual Celebrity Beach Bowl. She was a standout volleyball player in high school and has taken up boxing. After signing with Harley-Davidson, Miller received her motorcycle license and rides a Harley Nightster. She has said that she would like to be a sportscaster. Miller comes from a family of nurses. Her mother returned to college to become a pediatrics nurse and her sisters are also nurses. She has expressed an interest in following the same career path if she stops modeling.

As of 2009, Miller is an ambassador for the American Cancer Society. Proceeds from her online store are donated to the charity. She also supports the Young Survival Coalition, which raises awareness of breast cancer in women under 40, as well as environmental organization the Surfrider Foundation, which aims to preserve the world&#x27;s oceans and beaches. In 2014 she was honored with the inaugural Paul Walker Ocean Leadership Award.
In October 2009, Miller hosted the Monte Foundation music festival, an annual fundraiser for schools in the Aptos area, where she and Guess own a home.
She is also an ambassador for the USO; she visits military bases and receives frequent fan mail from American troops worldwide.

In May 2015, Miller posed while pregnant with her second child as part of a PETA campaign against SeaWorld&#x27;s practice of separating baby orcas from their mothers.

<doc id="515256" wikidata="Q1776037" url="?curid=515256" title="Balsam">
<text>Balsam is the resinous exudate (or sap) which forms on certain kinds of trees and shrubs. Balsam (from Latin &quot;balsamum&quot; &quot;gum of the balsam tree,&quot; ultimately from a Semitic source such as ) owes its name to the biblical Balm of Gilead.

== Chemistry ==
Balsam is a solution of plant-specific resins in plant-specific solvents (essential oils). Such resins can include resin acids, esters, or alcohols. The exudate is a mobile to highly viscous liquid often containing crystallized resin particles. Over time and as a result of other influences the exudate loses its liquidizing components or gets chemically converted into a solid material (i.e. by autoxidation).

Balsams often contain benzoic or cinnamic acid or their esters. Plant resins are sometimes classified according to other plant constituents in the mixture, for example as:
* pure resins (guaiac, hashish), 
* gum-resins (containing gums/polysaccharides), 
* oleo-gum-resins (a mixture of gums, resins and essential oils), 
* oleo-resins (a mixture of resins and essential oils, e. g. capsicum, ginger and aspidinol), 
* balsams (resinous mixtures that contain cinnamic and/or benzoic acid or their esters), 
* glycoresins (podophyllin, jalap, kava kava),
* fossil resins (amber, asphaltite, Utah resin).

Usually, animal secretions (musk, shellac, beeswax) are excluded from this definition.

== The Balsam of Matariyya ==
The Balsam of Matariyya was a substance famous as a panacea among physicians in the Middle East and Europe during the Antique and Medieval periods. The substance has long been used as a medicine, with early references to the substance recorded as far back as 285 BC. The Balsam of Matariyya was said to be derived from an Egyptian plant and is sometimes also referred to as the balm of Gilead or the balm of Mecca.

<doc id="515258" wikidata="Q970700" url="?curid=515258" title="Greco-Buddhism">
<text>Greco-Buddhism or Graeco-Buddhism denotes a cultural syncretism between Hellenistic culture and Buddhism developed between the 4th century BC and the 5th century AD in Gandhara, which was in present-day Pakistan and parts of north-east Afghanistan. While the Greco-Buddhist art shows clear Hellenistic influences, the majority of scholars do not assume a noticeable Greek influence on Gandharan Buddhism beyond the artistic realm.

Cultural interactions between ancient Greece and Buddhism date back to Greek forays into the Indian subcontinent from the time of Alexander the Great. A few years after Alexander&#x27;s death, the Easternmost fringes of the empire of his general Seleucus were lost in a war with the Mauryan Empire, under the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka would convert to Buddhism and spread the religious philosophy throughout his domain, as recorded in the Edicts of Ashoka. This spread to the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, which itself seceded from the Seleucid Empire.

Following the collapse of the Mauryan Empire, Buddhism continued to flourish under the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdoms, and Kushan Empire. Mahayana Buddhism was spread from the Gangetic plains in India into Gandhara and then Central Asia during the Mauryan Era, where it became the most prevalent branch of Buddhism in Central Asia. Mahayana Buddhism was later transmitted through the Silk Road into the Han dynasty during the Kushan era under the reign of Emperor Kanishka. Buddhist tradition details the monk, Majjhantika of Varanasi, was made responsible for spreading Buddhism in the region by Emperor Ashoka. Later on, the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek king Menander I, who may have converted to Buddhism, stimulated the spread of the religion as well.

==Historical outline==

The introduction of Hellenistic Greece to central Asia started after the conquest of that region by Darius the Great and his Persian Achaemenid Empire. He and his successors also conquered the Anatolian peninsula, which at the time was inhabited by many Greek cultures. When they rebelled, those Greeks were often ethnically cleansed by being relocated to the far end of the Persian Empire, those central Asian provinces. When Alexander the Great conquered Achaemenid Empire and further regions of Central Asia in 334 BC, he thus encountered many Greeks already established in the easternmost stretches of its empire. He then ventured into Punjab (land of five rivers). Alexander crossed the Indus and Jhelum River when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the Battle of the Hydaspes. Alexander&#x27;s army would mutiny and retreat along the Beas River when confronted by the Nanda Empire, thus wouldn&#x27;t conquer Punjab entirely.

Thanks to relocation by the Persian Empire, there was established Greek culture in the far east of Alexander&#x27;s empire. He founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the Amu Darya and Bactria, and Greek settlements further extended to the Khyber Pass, Gandhara (see Taxila), and the Punjab. Following Alexander&#x27;s death on June 10, 323 BC, the Diadochi or &quot;successors&quot; founded their own kingdoms. General Seleucus set up the Seleucid Empire in Anatolia and Central Asia and extended as far as India.

The Mauryan Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya, would first conquer the Nanda Empire. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the Seleucid-Mauryan War. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the Indus Valley and Gandhara to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus&#x27;s daughter as Chandragupta&#x27;s wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as reparations for lives lost and damages sustained.

The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the largest Indian empire. Following the destructive Kalinga War, Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place. As ascribed in the Edicts of Ashoka, the Emperor spread Dharma as Buddhism throughout his empire. Ashoka claims to have converted many, including the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
The decline and overthrow of the Mauryans by the Shunga Empire, and of the revolt of Bactria in the Seleucid Empire led to the formation of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC). To their north, the Greco-Bactrians were followed by the secession of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 AD). Even when, centuries later, these Hellenized regions were conquered first by the Yuezhi, then by the Indo-Scythians and the Kushan Empire (1st–3rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive there.

Buddhism in India was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as Bengal largely ended during the Islamic invasions of India.

==Cultural interaction==

The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic but also on the religious plane.

===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331–325 BC)===
When Alexander invaded Bactria and Gandhara, these areas may already have been under Sramanic influence, likely Buddhist and Jain. According to a legend preserved in the Pali Canon, two merchant brothers from Kamsabhoga in Bactria, Tapassu and Bhallika, visited Gautama Buddha and became his disciples. The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha&#x27;s teaching. In 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as Taxiles, surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander. Alexander fought a battle against King Porus of Pauravas in Punjab, the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.

===Mauryan Empire (322–183 BC)===
The Mauryan Empire would later defeat the successor Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid-Mauryan War. Resulting in the transfer of the satraps in the Indus Valley and Gandhara, that had been part of the Achaemenid, Macedonian and Seleucidian, to the Mauryan Empire. However, contacts were kept with his Greco-Iranian neighbors in the Seleucid Empire. Emperor Seleucus I Nicator came to a marital agreement as part of a peace treaty, and several Greeks, such as the historian Megasthenes, resided at the Mauryan court.
Chandragupta&#x27;s grandson Ashoka embraced the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, insisting on non-violence to humans and animals (ahimsa), and general precepts regulating the life of laypeople.

According to the Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in Greek and some in Aramaic, the official language of the Achaemenids, he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the Hellenistic period:
Ashoka also claims he converted to Buddhism Greek populations within his realm:

Finally, some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as the famous Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (&quot;Yona&quot;) Buddhist monks active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII), founding the eponymous Dharmaguptaka school of Buddhism.

===Greek presence in Bactria (325–125 BC)===

Alexander had established in Bactria several cities (such as Ai-Khanoum and Bagram) and an administration that were to last more than two centuries under the Seleucid Empire and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, all the time in direct contact with Indian territory. The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the Maurya Empire, such as the historian Megasthenes under Chandragupta Maurya, and later Deimachus under his son Bindusara, who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:

The Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of Ai-Khanoum. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the Shunga Empire around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the Indo-Greek Kingdom, under which Buddhism was able to flourish.

===Indo-Greek Kingdom and Buddhism (180 BC – 10 AD)===

Northern India was the Indo-Greek Kingdom, centered approximately around Alexandria Eschate. They controlled various areas of the northern Indian territory until 10 AD. Buddhism prospered under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the Shungas (185–73 BC), who had overthrown the Mauryans. Zarmanochegas was a śramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo, Cassius Dio, and Nicolaus of Damascus traveled to Antioch and Athens while Augustus (died 14 AD) was ruling the Roman Empire.

====Coinage====
The coins of the Indo-Greek king Menander I (r. 160–135 BC), found from Afghanistan to central India, bear the inscription &quot;Saviour King Menander&quot; in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as Zoilos I, Strato I, Heliokles II, Theophilos, Peukolaos, Menander II, and Archebius display on their coins the title &quot;Maharajasa Dharmika&quot; (lit. &quot;King of the Dharma&quot;) in Prakrit written in Kharoshthi.

Some of the coins of Menander I and Menander II incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess Nike. According to the Milinda Pañha, at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist arhat, a fact also echoed by Plutarch, who explains that his relics were shared and enshrined.

The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage may also have been associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of Antialcidas and Menander II, where the elephant in the coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the Zoroastrian Indo-Parthian Kingdom invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.
Finally, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as Amyntas Nikator, Nicias, Peukolaos, Hermaeus, Hippostratos and Menander II, depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka mudra (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha&#x27;s teaching.

====Cities====
According to Ptolemy, Greek cities were founded by the Greco-Bactrians in northern India. Menander established his capital in Sagala (modern Sialkot, Punjab, Pakistan) one of the centers of the blossoming Buddhist culture. A large Greek city built by Demetrius and rebuilt by Menander has been excavated at the archaeological site of Sirkap near Taxila, where Buddhist stupas were standing side-by-side with Hindu and Greek temples, indicating religious tolerance and syncretism.

====Scriptures====

Evidence of direct religious interaction between Greek and Buddhist thought during the period include the &quot;Milinda Pañha&quot; or &quot;Questions of Menander&quot;, a Pali-language discourse in the Platonic style held between Menander I and the Buddhist monk Nagasena.
The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, chapter 29, records that during Menander&#x27;s reign, a Greek &quot;thera&quot; (elder monk) named &quot;Mahadharmaraksita&quot; led 30,000 Buddhist monks from &quot;the Greek city of Alexandria&quot; (possibly Alexandria on the Caucasus, around north of today&#x27;s Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of a stupa, indicating that Buddhism flourished in Menander&#x27;s territory and that Greeks took a very active part in it.

Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek meridarch (civil governor of a province) named Theodorus, describing in Kharosthi how he enshrined relics of the Buddha. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BC. Finally, Buddhist tradition recognizes Menander as one of the great benefactors of the faith, together with Ashoka and Kanishka the Great.

Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the Mahayana figure of &quot;Lokesvararaja Buddha&quot; (). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century CE.

===Kushan empire (1st–3rd century AD)===
The Kushan Empire, one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi, settled in Bactria around 125 BC, displacing the Greco-Bactrians and invading the northern parts of Pakistan and India from around 1 AD. By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century. They used the Greek script to write their language, as exemplified by their coins and their adoption of the Greek alphabet.
The Kushan King Kanishka, who honored Zoroastrian, Greek and Brahmanic deities as well as the Buddha and was famous for his religious syncretism, convened the Fourth Buddhist council around 100 in Kashmir in order to redact the Sarvastivadin canon. Some of Kanishka&#x27;s coins bear the earliest representations of the Buddha on a coin (around 120), in Hellenistic style and with the word &quot;Boddo&quot; in Greek script. Kanishka also had the original Gandhari Prakrit Mahāyāna sūtras translated into Sanskrit, &quot;a turning point in the evolution of the Buddhist literary canon&quot; The Kanishka casket, dated to the first year of Kanishka&#x27;s reign in 127, was signed by a Greek artist named &quot;Agesilas&quot;, who oversaw work at Kanishka&#x27;s stupas (cetiya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date.

==Philosophical influences==
Several Greek philosophers, including Pyrrho, Anaxarchus, and Onesicritus accompanied Alexander in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian philosophers who pursued asceticism, generally described as gymnosophists (&quot;naked philosophers&quot;).

===Pyrrhonism===
Pyrrho returned to Greece and founded Pyrrhonism, considered by modern scholars as the first Western school of skepticism. The Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtius explained that Pyrrho&#x27;s equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.

Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho&#x27;s interpretation of the Buddhist three marks of existence.

===Cynicism===
Another of these philosophers, Onesicritus, a Cynic, is said by Strabo to have learnt in India the following precepts: &quot;That nothing that happens to a man is bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. ... That the best philosophy [is] that which liberates the mind from [both] pleasure and grief&quot;. Cynicism, particularly the Cynic Peregrinus Proteus was further influenced by the tales of the gymnosophists, particularly the examples set by Kalanos, Dandamis, and Zarmanochegas.

===Cyrenaicism===
The Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, from the city of Cyrene where Magas of Cyrene ruled, is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka&#x27;s Buddhist missionaries.

==Artistic influences==

Numerous works of Greco-Buddhist art display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences in such creation centers as Gandhara. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of Western Asiatic or Hellenistic origin.

===Anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha===
Although there is still some debate, the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was &quot;aniconic&quot;: the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the Bodhi Tree, Buddha footprints, the Dharmachakra).

This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha&#x27;s sayings reported in the &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot; that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.

Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of &quot;their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha&quot;. In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop syncretic divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is Serapis, introduced by Ptolemy I Soter in Hellenistic Egypt, who combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek god-king (Apollo, or possibly the deified founder of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Demetrius I of Bactria), with the traditional physical characteristics of the Buddha.
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: himation, the contrapposto stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and ushnisha apparently derived from the style of the Apollo Belvedere (330 BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism. A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the modern site of Hadda, Afghanistan. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the physical characteristics of the Buddha in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the Pāli canon; we find the same description in the &quot;Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā&quot;. Additionally, the nudity of Jainist sculptures might have been inspired by Apollonian archetypes.

Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display &quot;a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively Roman.&quot;

The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of enlightenment described by Buddhism, allowing it to reach a wider audience:
During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more Indian and Asian elements.

===Hellenized Buddhist pantheon===

Several other Buddhist deities may have been influenced by Greek gods. For example, Heracles with a lion-skin, the protector deity of Demetrius I of Bactria, &quot;served as an artistic model for Vajrapani, a protector of the Buddha&quot;. In Japan, this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular Niō guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.

According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chūō University, Japan, besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the Mahayana pantheon such as the Japanese Fūjin, inspired from the Greek divinity Boreas through the Greco-Buddhist Wardo, or the mother deity Hariti inspired by Tyche.

In addition, forms such as garland-bearing cherubs, vine scrolls, and such semihuman creatures as the centaur and triton, are part of the repertory of Hellenistic art introduced by Greco-Roman artists in the service of the Kushan court.

==Exchanges==

===Proselytism in the East===

Greek monks played a direct role in the upper hierarchy of Buddhism, and in its early dissemination. During the rule (165–135 BC) of the Greco-Bactrian King Menander I (Pali: &quot;Milinda&quot;), Mahadharmaraksita (literally translated as &#x27;Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma&#x27;) was &quot;a Greek (Pali: Yona, lit. Ionian) Buddhist head monk,&quot; according to the Mahavamsa (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from &quot;the Greek city of Alasandra&quot; (Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150 km north of today&#x27;s Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura. Dharmaraksita (Sanskrit), or Dhammarakkhita (Pali) (translation: &quot;Protected by the Dharma&quot;), was one of the missionaries sent by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to proselytize the Buddhist faith. He is described as being a Greek (Pali: &quot;Yona&quot;, lit. &quot;Ionian&quot;) in the Mahavamsa, and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic Greek involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, Menander I was famously converted to Buddhism by Nagasena, who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk Dharmaraksita. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an arhat under Nagasena&#x27;s guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism. The dialogue of the Greek King Menander I (Pali &quot;Milinda&quot;) with the monk Nagasena comprises the Pali Buddhist work known as the Milinda Panha.

Buddhist monks from the region of Gandhara, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, later played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. Greco-Buddhist Kushan monks such as Lokaksema () travelled to the Chinese capital of Loyang, where they became the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as indicated by the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves frescos from the Tarim Basin. In legend too Bodhidharma, the founder of Chán-Buddhism, which later became Zen, and the legendary originator of the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolin Kung Fu, is described as a Buddhist monk from Central Asia in the first Chinese references to him (Yan Xuan-Zhi in 547). Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian, and he is referred as &quot;The Blue-Eyed Barbarian&quot; () in Chinese Chan texts. In 485 CE, according to the 7th-century Chinese historical treatise Liang Shu, five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of Fusang (&quot;The country of the extreme East&quot; beyond the sea, probably eastern Japan), where they introduced Buddhism:

Two half-brothers from Gandhara, Asanga and Vasubandhu (4th century), created the Yogacara or &quot;Mind-only&quot; school of Mahayana Buddhism, which through one of its major texts, the Lankavatara Sutra, became a founding block of Mahayana, and particularly Zen, philosophy.

===Greco-Buddhism in the West===
Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the Silk Road is confirmed by the Roman craze for silk from the 1st century BC to the point that the Senate issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three authors: Strabo (64/63 BC – ), Seneca the Younger ( – 65 AD), and Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). The aforementioned Strabo and Plutarch (–125 AD) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king Menander, confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.

Zarmanochegas (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius, met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch while Augustus (d. 14 AD) was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death. His story and tomb in Athens were well-known over a century later. Plutarch (d. 120 AD) in his Life of Alexander, after discussing the self-immolation of Calanus of India (Kalanos) witnessed by Alexander writes: &quot;The same thing was done long after by another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you &#x27;the Indian&#x27;s Monument,&#x27;&quot; referring to Zarmanochegas&#x27; tomb in Roman Athens.

Another century later the Christian church father Clement of Alexandria (d. 215 AD) mentioned Buddha by name in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): &quot;The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called &quot;Hylobii&quot; neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of Buddha (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours.&quot;

Indian gravestones from the Ptolemaic period have been found in Alexandria in Egypt. The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria at this time is important, since &quot;It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established&quot;. 

The pre-Christian monastic order of the Therapeutae is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word &quot;Theravāda&quot;, a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have &quot;almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism&quot;. They may even have been descendants of Asoka&#x27;s emissaries to the West. While Philo of Alexandria&#x27;s description of the doctrines and practices of the Therapeutae leaves great ambiguity about what religion they are associated with, analysis by religious scholar Ullrich R. Kleinhempel indicates that the most likely religion the Therapeutae practiced was Buddhism.

In 2022, American-Polish archeologists unearthed an Egyptian temple dedicated to the goddess Isis and god Serapis, containing a Buddha sculpture and Hindu gods, indicating Greco-Buddhist influence extending to the early Roman period.

===Buddhism and Christianity===

Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance.

One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists.

Saint Jerome (4th century AD) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says &quot;was born from the side of a virgin,&quot; and the influential early Christian church father Clement of Alexandria (d. 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα) in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV). The legend of Christian saints Barlaam and Josaphat draws on the life of the Buddha.

== Reception ==
The idea of a Greek influence on the development of Buddhism has been particularly advocated by Étienne Lamotte and Thomas McEvilley, who has speculated that “like the Gandharan art style, the Gandharan Buddhist style must have had a prominent Hellenic factor”, although he does not employ the term &quot;Greco-Buddhism&quot; for this. McEvilley&#x27;s theory has been met by skepticism by other scholars.

While the Hellenistic influences in Gandharan Buddhist art have been widely accepted it remains a matter of controversy among art historians whether the non-Indian characteristics of Gandhāran sculpture reflect a continuous Greek tradition rooted in Alexander’s conquests in Bactria, subsequent contacts with later traditions of the Hellenistic east, direct communication with contemporary artists from the Roman empire, or some complex conjunction of such sources. Examples include statues of bodhisattvas adorned with royal jewellery (bracelets and torques) and amulet boxes, the contrapposto stance, an emphasis on draperies, and a plethora of Dionysian themes.

Beyond the artistic realm, however, most scholars do not assume a noticeable Greek influence on Gandharan Buddhism. Some have identified a need for further research in this regard. Olga Kubica has criticised the term &quot;Greco-Buddhism&quot; as &quot;inadequate&quot; since a &quot;reconciliation or union of differing systems of belief&quot; did not occur here. She states that she does &quot;not exclude the possibility that some phenomena within Buddhism may be interpreted as a manifestation of syncretism between Greek and Buddhist elements, but the term Greco-Buddhism applies only to certain aspects and not to the entirety of Greco-Buddhist relations&quot;.

The term &quot;Greco-Buddhist art&quot; has also been criticised among art historians. According to Peter Stewart, it is &quot;deeply deceptive in several ways and should be avoided&quot;. Johanna Hanink has attributed the concept of &quot;Greco-Buddhist art&quot; to a European scholarly inability to accept that natives could have developed &quot;the pleasing proportions and elegant poses of sculptures from ancient Gandhara&quot;, citing Michael Falser and arguing that the entire notion of &quot;Buddhist art with a Greek &#x27;essence&#x27;&quot; is a colonial imposition that originated during British rule in India.

<text>Shelvoke and Drewry was a Letchworth, Hertfordshire, manufacturer of special purpose commercial vehicles. It was best known for its innovative waste collection vehicles that were the preferred choice of municipal authorities in the UK together with their gully emptiers, cesspool cleaning vehicles and street watering and washing vehicles.

Cable drum carriers were supplied to the General Post Office and vehicles and ground equipment built for the Royal Air Force.

Shelvoke and Drewry also manufactured fire engines, buses and fork-lift trucks.

==The Shelvoke and Drewry Freighter==
The business began in 1921 as a partnership of Harry Shelvoke and James Drewry, both of whom had successful careers in commercial vehicle design and manufacture. At that time, municipal refuse vehicles were almost all horse-drawn, uneconomical and inconvenient and required the use of ladders. In their &quot;S D Freighter&quot;, Shelvoke and Drewry offered a motorised, low-loading alternative which became almost universal.

Ownership was soon transferred from their partnership to Shelvoke and Drewry Limited, incorporated 10 October 1922. A stock market listing was achieved in 1937. The &quot;Freighter&quot;, originally a multi-purpose flatbed truck notable for its tiny wheels and tiller-type steering, was adapted for refuse collection. Several vehicles were also converted into single-decker buses and used in Worthing, West Sussex, where they were known as the Worthing Tramocars.

Shelvoke and Drewry rapidly became an established innovator in the field of refuse collection vehicle design, producing vehicles such as the Fore and Aft Tipper, which used a pivoting body to redistribute the load, and the Revopak of the 1970s, which used a huge revolving fork to mutilate and compact refuse.

===War production===
During the Second World War, like most British manufacturers, Shelvoke and Drewry&#x27;s entire output was devoted to the war effort, producing aircraft parts, equipment for landing craft and tanks, and even a miniature submarine (the Welfreighter) at their Letchworth plant.

===1960s===
Profits were falling by 1964. In that year the reasons given by the chairman were the introduction of their new &quot;Defiant&quot; forklift trucks, the transfer of production to a new factory building, and a scarcity of labour and materials in the face of intense competition from the big motor manufacturers.

==Subsequent owners==

===W P Butterfield 1966 to 1983===
In March 1966 Shelvoke and Drewry were bought by Yorkshire engineers W P Butterfield which later became a component of the Butterfield-Harvey Group. Butterfield-Harvey sold the Fork-lift trucks division to Rubery Owen Conveyancer in 1974. The chairman explained that with &quot;limited labour and facilities it has only made a marginal contribution to Shelvoke and Drewry profits&quot;. Order books for the dustcart products were reported to be &quot;nine months long&quot;.

Babcock &amp; Wilcox began a bid for Butterfield-Harvey in mid 1977 declaring its main interest to be in Shelvoke and Drewry which then represented more than a third of Butterfield&#x27;s activities. But the bid failed to proceed.
In the late 1970s, Shelvoke and Drewry went head-to-head with its arch-rival Dennis, and once-again began to manufacture fire engines through its newly established Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) division. S&amp;D had also collaborated with Dennis along with Ogle Design to develop a new common cab for both companies&#x27; product lines - this emerged as the P-Series in 1978. By the end of 1979 the chairman reported that Shelvoke and Drewry turned out about 1,000 vehicles each year. Dustcarts left the factory as finished products but fire and air crash tenders were fitted out, completed, by outside contractors. A quarter of municipal vehicles were exported and 85 per cent of the special purpose chassis were sent overseas.

Early in 1981 Shelvoke and Drewry were obliged to report they had made another 150 redundant having previously cut the jobs of over 300 employees. Remaining workers were on a three-day week and apprentices on a two-day week. The following year another 100 jobs were cut and factories were closed.

===Shelvoke Dempster 1984 to 1990===
At the end of 1983 Butterfield was rescued by a short-term loan from an American investment company, Technology Incorporated. Butterfield was unable to raise alternative funds to make repayment and under the terms of the loan Technology Incorporated assumed control of Butterfield. Ownership was transferred to Shelvoke Dempster on 1 January 1984. Dempster Systems was an American subsidiary of Technology Incorporated.

Otherwise Shelvoke&#x27;s circumstances did not change. Demand for dustcarts had not picked up again, Shelvoke was described as Butterfield&#x27;s &quot;running sore&quot;. One of the two Shelvoke factories was forced to close (160 jobs) and in-house component manufacture was contracted out.

The first new Shelvoke Dempster product, Dempster&#x27;s &quot;Routechief&quot; intermittent rear loader, went into production at Letchworth. Shelvoke Dempster also distributed these American-made products: &quot;Routeking II&quot; rear loader, &quot;Dumpster&quot; front loader, &quot;Dinosaur&quot; and &quot;Dragon III&quot; roll-on and roll-off systems and Dempster &quot;Dumpster rentals products. Established Shelvoke products like &quot;Revopak&quot; and the special-purpose vehicles remained in production at Letchworth. The Letchworth workforce was now 350 people.

Shelvoke Dempster was held by Krug International (UK) Limited, a British subsidiary of American investor Technology Incorporated. Krug decided to wind up its industrial and engineering divisions and in the summer of 1989 announced it was keen to sell Shelvoke.

===Shelvoke 1990 to 1991===
In mid 1990 there was a management buy-out of Shelvoke Dempster and Dempster was removed from the name of the business. Shelvoke&#x27;s 194 employees were to be offered a share in the business.

===Shutdown===
However the new venture went into receivership in July 1991. The receivers sold the saleable activities and the remaining assets and design rights were bought by Dennis Eagle. About 70 Shelvoke staff were made redundant. Dennis Eagle expected the extra business would add about £2.5 million to turnover but no new Shelvoke designs would be made once current orders were filled. Parts and maintenance would be supplied for the remaining (2,000?) Shelvoke vehicles still operating. The Letchworth factory closed.

==Post mortem==
Shelvoke&#x27;s demise was attributed to a number of factors - for instance the deregulation of waste collection in the 1980s meant that many municipal authorities subcontracted this activity out to private companies. Their vehicles had traditionally been considerably more expensive than those of their competitors (largely due to their hand-built aluminium bodywork) and cost-conscious councils soon started investing in cheaper foreign vehicles. Shelvoke had also spent huge amounts trying to make money on the special purpose vehicles venture, and fought an increasingly futile battle with Dennis. They tenaciously stuck with their &quot;Revopak&quot; continuous loading system for waste collection vehicles, which, although effective, was more expensive to operate due to higher fuel consumption, and authorities looked for cost-saving intermittent-loading dustcarts instead. Dennis launched their &quot;Phoenix&quot; range of sweep/slide style refuse compactor dustcarts in 1979, which, with their lower operating costs, quickly eroded Shelvoke&#x27;s market share.

Shelvoke and Drewry vehicles were still in service for many years after the demise of SD. For example, many fire engines were kept at small provincial airports, and many developing countries used ex-British second-hand refuse collection vehicles. Also many were kept in use until recently on the island of Malta. SD forklifts can still be found working across the uk and the rest of the world.

<text>A Playmate is a female model featured in the centerfold/gatefold of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine as Playmate of the Month (PMOTM). The PMOTM&#x27;s pictorial includes nude photographs and a centerfold poster, along with a pictorial biography and the &quot;Playmate Data Sheet&quot;, which lists her birthdate, measurements, turn-ons, and turn-offs. At the end of the year, one of the 12 Playmates of the Month is named Playmate of the Year (PMOTY). Every Playmate of the Month is awarded a prize of US$25,000 and each Playmate of the Year receives an additional prize of US$100,000 plus a car (on a short-term lease) and other discretionary gifts. In addition, Anniversary Playmates are usually chosen to celebrate a milestone year of the magazine. The use of the word &quot;Playmate&quot; in a sexual sense did not originate with &quot;Playboy&quot;, and was seen at least as early as 1950 in Vue magazine (vol 1, #1). They were also termed &quot;Playboy Bunny&quot;.

&quot;Playboy&quot; encourages potential Playmates to send photos with &quot;girl next door&quot; appeal for consideration; others may submit photos of Playmate candidates, and may be eligible for a finder&#x27;s fee if their model is selected. In addition, &quot;casting calls&quot; are held regularly in major US cities to offer opportunities for women to test for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Until just prior to the death of Hugh Hefner, he personally selected each, Playmate of the Month and every Playmate of the Year, taking into account an annual readers&#x27; poll.

The final Playmate of the Month was published digitally in December 2020. &quot;Playboy&quot; also ended the Playmate of the Year title in 2020, instead awarding all 2019 Playmates the shared title of Playmates of the Year. All 2020 Playmates were given yearbook superlatives rather than a PMOTY title.

In 2021, &quot;Playboy&quot; digitally published two quarterly Playmates. No Playmates have been published since Miss Spring 2021, Hailee Lautenbach.

According to &quot;Playboy&quot;, there is no such thing as a &quot;former&quot; Playmate because &quot;Once a Playmate, always a Playmate&quot;.

==History==
Marilyn Monroe, who was featured in the first issue, was the only one to appear as &quot;Sweetheart of the Month&quot;. The first model called a Playmate of the Month was Margie Harrison, Miss January 1954, in the second issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. Generally a woman may appear only once as a Playmate, but in the early years of the magazine, some models were featured multiple times. Marilyn Waltz (February 1954, April 1954, April 1955 her first appearance was as Margaret Scott) and Janet Pilgrim (July 1955, December 1955, and October 1956) are tied for the most appearances. Margie Harrison (January 1954, June 1954) and Marguerite Empey (May 1955, February 1956) are the only other women to appear more than once as Playmates.

=== Underage nudity ===
Several playmates including Nancy Crawford (April 1959), Donna Michelle (December 1963), Linda Moon (October 1966), Patti Reynolds (September 1965) and Teddi Smith (July 1960) posed when they were 17. Elizabeth Ann Roberts (January 1958) whose pictorial was called &quot;Schoolmate Playmate&quot; posed when she was 16. Hugh Hefner and Roberts&#x27; mother were arrested as a result, but the case was subsequently dismissed because Roberts&#x27; mother had signed a statement that her daughter was 18 before the photo shoot. In 1977, Ursula Buchfellner posed for the German edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; when she was 16 and subsequently posed for the American edition (October 1979) when she was 18. Dutch Playmate twins Karin and Mirjam van Breeschooten appeared at age 17 in their country&#x27;s edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; in June 1988; at 18, they were Misses September 1989 in the US version.

Some women have become Playmates in their 30s. Dolores Donlon (August 1957) is the oldest Playmate to date, appearing in her shoot at the age of 36.

==Playmate of the Year== 
In the early days of &quot;Playboy&quot;, there was no official prize for the most popular Playmate at the end of each year. Although February 1954 Playmate Marilyn Waltz gained much popularity, receiving more fan mail than any other Playmate that year, she was not crowned PMOTY. Neither was December 1956 Playmate Lisa Winters, who was &quot;named&quot; Playmate of the Year but not technically crowned as such (causing some controversy regarding semantics); and, although Joyce Nizzari, Miss December 1958, was named the &quot;most popular&quot; Playmate of 1958, the PMOTY competition was first &quot;officially&quot; won in 1960 by Miss December 1959, Ellen Stratton. The 2009 PMOY, Ida Ljungqvist, was the 50th PMOTY and the second model of African descent to win the title, the first being Renee Tenison.

A PMOTY makes her appearance the year following her first appearance as PMOTM. This feature is usually published in the June issue, although sometimes it has been published in the May or July issue. Until 2003, each year&#x27;s Playmate of the Year would routinely appear on the cover of her PMOTY issue, in which her PMOTY pictorial is featured. However, from 2003 to 2005, PMOTYs did not appear on the covers of their PMOTY issues, and 2007 PMOTY Sara Jean Underwood did not either. Instead, celebrities appearing in celebrity pictorials in the PMOTY issues appeared on the covers. The 2010 PMOTY, Hope Dworaczyk, did appear on the cover, and was the first model to be the subject of a three-dimensional &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfold photograph.

The average age of a Playmate of the Year, 23.5 years, is slightly higher than that of a Playmate of the Month, 22.4 years.
In 1964, at the age of 18, Donna Michelle became the youngest PMOY ever. Jo Collins (1965) and Christa Speck (1962) both were 19. Sharon Clark (1971), Karen McDougal (1998) and Ida Ljungqvist (2009) became PMOTY at the age of 27. Only three women became PMOTY in their 30s: Tiffany Fallon (2005) at 31, Kathy Shower (1986) at 33, and Eugena Washington (2016) at 31.

<text>Mark Oliver Everett, also known by his stage name E (born April 10, 1963) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and the frontman of the rock band Eels. He is known for writing songs tackling subjects such as death, loneliness, divorce, childhood innocence, depression, and unrequited love, often from personal experience.

== Early life ==
Everett is the son of physicist Hugh Everett III, originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Mark&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Harold &quot;Kid&quot; Gore, a men&#x27;s basketball, football and baseball coach at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.

When Everett was in his early teens, he was attending a concert by English rock band The Who when a special effects laser struck him directly in the eye and, as a result, he has needed to wear glasses ever since.

Everett&#x27;s father died of a heart attack when Everett was 19. Mark was the one to find him. Everett later made a documentary about his father&#x27;s theory and his relationship with him, &quot;Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives&quot;, for the BBC. It aired on the PBS series &quot;NOVA&quot; in 2008.

== Career ==
=== E ===
In 1987, Everett moved from his family home in Virginia and settled in California. There, Everett began his professional musical career with two major-label albums: &quot;A Man Called E&quot; (1992) and &quot;Broken Toy Shop&quot; (1993). The pseudonym &quot;E&quot; was used for both of these early recordings. He became known as &quot;E&quot; because there were several people in his life at the time who had the same first name.

=== Eels ===
In 1995, Everett formed the band Eels in Los Angeles. Their studio albums include &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot; (1996), &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot; (1998), &quot;Daisies of the Galaxy&quot; (2000), &quot;Souljacker&quot; (2001), &quot;Shootenanny!&quot; (2003), &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot; (2005), &quot;Hombre Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire&quot; (2009), &quot;End Times&quot; (2010), &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; (2010), &quot;Wonderful, Glorious&quot; (2013), &quot;The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett&quot; (2014), &quot;The Deconstruction&quot; (2018), &quot;Earth to Dora&quot; (2020), &quot;Extreme Witchcraft&quot; (2022), and &quot;Eels Time!&quot; (2024). &quot;Hombre Lobo&quot;, &quot;End Times&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; form a trilogy, focusing on &quot;lust, loss and redemption&quot;.

=== In film ===
Everett&#x27;s music has been featured in a number of films, including &quot;American Beauty&quot; (&quot;Cancer for the Cure&quot;), &quot;Scream 2&quot; (&quot;Your Lucky Day in Hell&quot;), &quot;Road Trip&quot; (&quot;Mr. E&#x27;s Beautiful Blues&quot;), &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (&quot;Christmas is Going to the Dogs&quot;), &quot;Holes&quot; (&quot;Eyes Down&quot;, &quot;Mighty Fine Blues&quot;), &quot;Shrek&quot; (&quot;My Beloved Monster&quot;), &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (&quot;I Need Some Sleep&quot;), &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (&quot;Royal Pain&quot; and &quot;Losing Streak&quot;), &quot;Shrek the Halls&quot; (&quot;The Stars Shine in the Sky Tonight&quot;), &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Freak&quot;), &quot;Henry Poole is Here&quot; (&quot;Love of the Loveless&quot;), &quot;The Big White&quot; (“I Want to Protect You”, &quot;Last Stop: This Town&quot;), &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (&quot;Souljacker Part 1&quot;), &quot;The Big Year&quot; (&quot;I Like Birds&quot;), as well as most of the music in &quot;Yes Man&quot;. Additionally, his song &quot;Fresh Blood&quot; (off &quot;Hombre Lobo&quot;) forms the music played over the credits of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Jinx&quot;.

Everett plays an acoustic version of the Eels song &quot;What I Have to Offer&quot; in a deleted scene from &quot;This Is 40&quot; (2012) and follows his performance by telling Rudd&#x27;s record executive character that the band has decided to sign a contract with a competing label.

== Other works ==
Although he has denied it, Everett is suspected of working under the alias MC Honky, who released the album &quot;I Am the Messiah&quot; in 2003.

The 2007 BBC Scotland / BBC Four television documentary &quot;Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives&quot; followed Everett as he talked to physicists and his father&#x27;s former colleagues about his father&#x27;s theory. The documentary won a Royal Television Society award on March 19, 2008. The documentary was shown in lieu of a support act during their UK, US, Irish and Australian tours in the spring of 2008. In the U.S., the PBS program &quot;Nova&quot; broadcast the documentary in October 2008.

In November 2007, Everett published his autobiography, entitled &quot;Things the Grandchildren Should Know&quot;.

On February 19, 2016, Everett appeared as Brian in Season 1, Episode 4 (&quot;A Party in the Hills&quot;) of Judd Apatow&#x27;s &quot;Love&quot;, playing a cover of Paul McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Jet&quot;. He also briefly appeared in Season 1, Episode 9, Season 2, Episode 2 and Season 3, Episode 6. He had a small cameo in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot; (2020). He has a brief cameo with his dog in the opening sequence of &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;.

In October 2024, Everett guested on New Zealand band Lips&#x27; single &quot;The Wolf,&quot; performing a monologue portraying a serial killer.

== Personal life ==
Everett&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth, died by suicide in 1996, and in 1998, his mother, Nancy Everett (née Gore), was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The lyrics of Eels&#x27; second album, &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot;, focused extensively on these events.

In 2000, Everett married Natalia Kovaleva, a Russian dentist he met near Hamburg, Germany. The marriage ended after five years. Following Eels&#x27; tour accompanying their album &quot;The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett&quot;, Everett took a break from music. During this period, he met and married a Scottish woman employed in the film industry. At the age of 54, Everett became a father for the first time when his wife gave birth to their son, Archie McGregor Everett. The couple, however, divorced some time later.

Everett&#x27;s cousin, Jennifer Lewis (née Gore), was a flight attendant who perished on American Airlines Flight 77, the plane that struck the Pentagon during the September 11 attacks in 2001. The plane struck the side of the Pentagon where his father had worked, and Everett remarks in his autobiography that he wonders whether the plane hit his father&#x27;s old office.

In July 2014, Everett was given the Freedom of the City of London, at a ceremony held prior to his concert at the Barbican Centre.

Everett has described himself as an agnostic.

<text>Braastad is a brand of cognac. It&#x27;s a range of product from the cognac House Tiffon. The name Braastad was introduced when Sverre Braastad (1879 – May 16, 1979) from Gjøvik, Norway, married the daughter of cognac producer Tiffon, Edith Rousseau, in 1913, and took over Tiffon, founded by Médéric Rousseau in 1875. The home of Braastad and Tiffon is Château de Triac. It is situated in the cru Petite Champagne in the cognac area, France.

The Braastad brand is owned by the Norwegian spirits company Arcus AS, which also is a minority shareholder of Tiffon.

<text>The Revopak is a type of waste collection vehicle manufactured by the British company Shelvoke and Drewry.

Introduced in 1971, the Revopak was a British-built clone of the French Bennes-Ray &quot;Superpac&quot;. It was one of the first vehicles to address the problem of compacting and destroying the high content of packaging materials now found in domestic refuse. 

By using a huge, hydraulic-powered rotating rake with large steel tines, refuse was scooped up from the loading hopper and forced through a set of stationary tines. The rotation of the rake increases the density of the load by continuously lifting the waste, mutilating it through the stationary tines, and then dropping it and repeating the cycle until it is small enough to be forced into the main body, where it is compacted, thus reducing the space required to dump it at the landfill site. 

Two generations of the Revopak were produced - the early 1971-1973 models used hydraulic motors which drove the compaction rake by means of chains, while the later models used a simpler and more robust drive system which consisted of twin synchronised hydraulic rams to operate the compaction system. Many variations were made of the basic design, including a multitude of different body lengths and payloads, plus SD developed bin lifters as an optional extra - a precursor to the modern wheeled bin collection systems of today. One disadvantage of the system was heavier fuel consumption, since the compaction system has to run continuously in order to be effective.

The Revopak was in continuous production until 1990, when SD went out of business, although the French built unit is still manufactured by SEMAT.</text><links>

<text>Joe Jitsu was a British humour comic strip, published in the British comics magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;, between 2004 and 2006. The comic was voted into the magazine after a poll by &quot;Beano&quot; readers in early 2004, along with another comic strip, &quot;Colin the Vet&quot;. Joe narrowly defeated Colin, but both became regulars in the comic, as Joe&#x27;s victory was by just 1%.

The strip, drawn by Wayne Thompson, who was also the artist for &quot;The Beano&quot;&#x27;s Billy Whizz and &quot;Jak&quot; in &quot;The Dandy&quot;, was about a boy who had a black belt in Karate. Some early strips also featured a man by the name of Johnny Woo, whose plans to get Joe into his dojo were never successful. Joe Jitsu also has a sister, called Jude.

In 2006, Joe&#x27;s strip made a reappearance in &quot;The Beano&quot;. However, this was only a short run as the strips were stockpiled, and after Alan Digby became Beano editor his strip quietly disappeared. Joe Jitsu also appeared in the long story &quot;Custard&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, which was reprinted in the Bash Street Kids annual 2010, as well as a one-panel cameo in Pluggy Love in the 2008 &quot;Beano&quot; annual.

<text>Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg (2 January 1783 – 22 July 1853) was a Danish painter. He was born in Blåkrog in the Duchy of Schleswig (now in Aabenraa Municipality, in the southern part of Jutland in Denmark). He went on to lay the foundation for the period of art known as the Golden Age of Danish Painting, and is referred to as the &quot;Father of Danish painting&quot;.

==Life==

===Growing up and early training===
On 2 January 1783, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was born in Blåkrog in the Duchy of Schleswig (now in Aabenraa Municipality, in the southern part of Jutland in Denmark), to Henrik Vilhelm Eckersberg, a painter and carpenter, and Ingeborg Nielsdatter. In 1786 the family moved to Blans, a village near the Alssund, where he enjoyed drawing pictures of the surrounding countryside, and taking sailing tours in his father&#x27;s boat. After confirmation he began his training as a painter under church and portrait painter Jes Jessen of Aabenraa (1797–1800). He continued his training at age 17 under Josiah Jacob Jessen in Flensborg, where he became an apprentice in May 1800. He, however, had his sights set on being accepted at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi&quot;) in Copenhagen.

===Training at the Academy===
Still under apprenticeship, Eckersberg produced proficient drawings and paintings. Having amassed some money, including financial support from local well-wishers, he arrived at Copenhagen&#x27;s Tollbooth on 23 May 1803. He was accepted into the Academy without payment in 1803, where he studied with Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, among others.

He made good progress, painting historical paintings, portraits and landscapes. However, friction between him and Abildgaard impeded his advancement, and he did not win the Academy&#x27;s big gold medal until 1809, after Abildgaard&#x27;s death. He also worked to earn living money as a hand labourer, and he made drawings for copperplate etchings.

Although he received promise of a travel stipend in conjunction with the gold medal, the actual funds would not be made available until 1812. On 1 July 1810, he married E. Christine Rebecca Hyssing against his wishes, in order to &#x27;legitimize&#x27; a son, Erling Carl Vilhelm Eckersberg, who had been born to her. Erling eventually followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps with an academy education, and a career as a copperplate engraver.

===Student travels===
Eager to travel, not only on account of his desire to stretch his artistic skills and knowledge, but also in order to escape the reality of his marriage, he made other arrangements for the financial support needed that would allow him to travel. On 3 July, a few days after the wedding, Eckersberg began his travels out of the country. Along with Tønnes Christian Bruun de Neergaard, writer, enthusiastic art lover and financial supporter, he made his way through Germany to Paris. Here he studied under neoclassicist Jacques-Louis David from 1811 to 1812. He improved his skills in painting the human form, and followed his teacher&#x27;s admonition to paint after Nature and the Antique in order to find Truth. It was here that he developed a lifelong friendship with his Paris roommate and fellow artist Jens Peter Møller, and with engraver Johan Frederik Clemens, Jens Juel&#x27;s collaborator.

After two years he travelled further via Florence to Rome where he continued his studies between 1813 and 1816. He worked on improving his skills as a history painter, and enjoyed painting smaller studies of the local life and area. He lived there three years among a large group of artists, with Bertel Thorvaldsen as the cultural head. Eckersberg and Thorvaldsen developed a close lasting relationship, and the master served the younger Eckersberg as both loyal friend and advisor. Eckersberg painted one of his best portraits, a portrait of Thorvaldsen, in Rome in 1814, which was donated to the Academy of Art. Life in Rome agreed with him, and he was greatly affected by the bright southern light he experienced there. He produced a large body of work during those years, including a number of exceptional landscape studies.

His divorce from Hyssing was finalized during his stay out of the country, and on 2 August 1816 he had returned to Denmark.

===An academic career===
Shortly after his return to Denmark Eckersberg arranged for his admission into the Academy, and received as the subject of his admissions painting the Norse legend, the Death of Baldur. On 8 February 1817 he wed Elisabeth Cathrine Julie Juel, daughter of Jens Juel, portrait painter and professor at the Academy. They had two sons and four daughters before her death in 1827.

He was admitted as a member of the Academy in October 1817, and was named professor there in 1818, having assumed the vacant professorship left after the death of Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard in 1809. The Academy had waited to fill the position until Eckersberg returned to Denmark from his student travels, while delaying the attempts by Abildgaard&#x27;s disciple, Christian Fædder Høyer, and by Christian Gotlieb Kratzenstein-Stub and J. L. Lund to seek the same position. Finally the Academy awarded the position not only to Eckersberg, but also to Lund.

A year after the death of his wife Elisabeth in 1827, he married her sister Susanne Henriette Emilie Juel, with whom he also had several children.

He was director of the Academy from 1827 to 1829. His eyesight failed him in later life and he had to give up painting. He died in Copenhagen of cholera on 22 July 1853 during the great epidemic. He is buried in Copenhagen&#x27;s Assistens Cemetery.

== Works ==
Eckersberg was commissioned to do a number of historical paintings for Christiansborg Palace, as well as altarpieces. His best known works are portraits of the Copenhagen middle class, such as the &quot;Nathanson family picture&quot; (Det Nathansonske Familiebillede), 1818, and the official portrait of Frederick VI (&quot;Frederik VI&quot;). In spite of his abilities in this genre, his career in portraiture was short-lived, due to the competition he received from then popular Christian Albrecht Jensen.

Marine paintings were another genre he developed with great interest. He had a passion for ships, and sailed around the Skagerrak, the Kattegat, the North Sea, and as far as the English Channel at the age of 56. The experience of sailing out on the open seas gave new dimension to his marine paintings, which until that point tended to be calm depictions. Now there was more attention given to movement and to waves.

The Admiralty in 1819 had granted him free access to the Copenhagen Naval Station (&quot;Holmen&quot;), thus giving him occasion to view the many ships – a favorite motive in his paintings. During summer, the sailors would practice swimming here – of course they swam naked. This gave Eckersberg a unique opportunity to watch men in a state of complete undress and to make an artistic evaluation of their physical build. He could thus here select the models whom he needed for his paintings with motives from Greek or Roman antiquity.

His biggest contribution to painting was through his professorship at the Academy. He revitalized teaching by taking students out into the field, where they were challenged to do studies from nature. In this way it was he who introduced direct study from nature into Danish art. He also encouraged his students to develop their individual strengths, thus creating unique styles.
He developed an increasing interest in perspective on account of his marine paintings. He wrote a dissertation on the subject called &quot;Linear perspective used in the art of painting&quot; (&quot;Linearperspektiven, anvendt paa Malerkunsten&quot;) in 1841, and taught classes on the subject at the Academy. He made a small number of etchings that combine observations of daily life with classical, harmonious principles of composition. This led the way to the characteristic manner in which Golden Age painters portrayed common, everyday life.

There is a self-portrait from 1803, a bust of him by Thorvaldsen from 1816 and a portrait by Marstrand from 1836.

<doc id="515299" wikidata="Q6411531" url="?curid=515299" title="King Edward VI School, Southampton">
<text>King Edward VI School (also known as King Edward&#x27;s, or KES) is a selective co-educational private day school founded in Southampton, England, in 1553. The Senior and Sixth Form site is on Hill Lane, Southampton whilst the Preparatory School is located in Romsey. 

The school was founded at the request of William Capon, who bequeathed money in his will for a grammar school for the poor. King Edward VI signed the necessary Royal Charter in 1553 and the school opened in 1554. King Edward&#x27;s became an independent school in 1978 and accepted girls into the sixth form in 1983. It became a fully co-educational school in 1994. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, and is a registered charity. The school roll is approximately 950 pupils.

The current building was designed by the English architect Ernest Berry Webber in the early 1930s.

==History==
King Edward&#x27;s was founded in 1553 when King Edward VI signed the necessary Royal Charter for a school to be built out of the proceeds of the will of William Capon, who had died in 1550 and bequeathed money for a grammar school for the poor. The school opened in 1554; it became an independent school in 1978, and accepted girls into the sixth form in 1983. It became a fully co-educational school in 1994. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

The current building was designed by the English architect Ernest Berry Webber in the early 1930s. Webber was a prolific designer of public buildings, including the civic centres at Southampton, Dagenham, and Hammersmith.

== Traditions and day-to-day life ==
The school motto is &quot;Dieu et mon droict&quot; (French for &quot;God and my right&quot;, referring to the monarch&#x27;s divine right to govern) and is generally used as the motto of the British monarch. Originally it was spelled &quot;Dieut et mon droict&quot;, the Early Modern French spelling, but later the &#x27;t&#x27; in &quot;Dieut&quot; was dropped in accordance with present French orthography. In the 1970s the motto was &#x27;Pax Huic Domui&#x27;, &#x27;Peace to this House&#x27; (traditionally the words a priest says when visiting a sick person). The school hymn is Our God, Our Help in Ages Past, written by a famous former pupil, Isaac Watts. The clock tower at the Civic Centre, Southampton plays the same tune at 4, 8, and 12 o&#x27;clock, after it has chimed the hour.

In 2011, 100% of pupils achieved 5+ A*-C GCSEs (or equivalent) including English and maths, with 85% achieving all English Baccalaureate subjects. The average fifth year student was entered for 11.2 qualifications.

As well as a main playing field, and an area of artificial turf large enough to accommodate 12 tennis courts, King Edward&#x27;s owns of sports grounds called Wellington on the edge of Southampton, where there is a water based astro pitch, along with netball courts, tennis courts, and a large number of grass pitches.

<doc id="515303" wikidata="Q1633212" url="?curid=515303" title="1993 Spanish general election">
<text>The 1993 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 6 June 1993, to elect the 5th of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 256 seats in the Senate.

The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) under Felipe González achieved the largest number of votes and seats for the fourth consecutive time, though it lost the absolute majority it had held in both chambers of the Cortes since 1982. In contrast, José María Aznar&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party (PP) won a large share of the vote, thus increasing their seats in both the Congress and the Senate and consolidating its position as the main opposition party. For the first time since 1979, the election brought in a hung parliament, forcing the governing PSOE to seek the support of nationalist groups in order to renew its mandate and secure a fourth term in government.

In the aftermath of the election, the PSOE saw itself under increased pressure due both to political instability as a result of its minority status, forcing it to rely on increasingly unstable pacts with Convergence and Union (CiU) to pass its legislation. The PSOE was also hobbled by the uncovering of numerous cases of corruption within the government itself. The pact with CiU would end in the fall of 1995, forcing González to call early elections 15 months before their scheduled date, which would see the opposition PP win for the first time.

==Overview==
===Electoral system===
The Spanish were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a prime minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive (yet limited in number) functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress&#x27; override. Voting for the was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age and in full enjoyment of their political rights.

For the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D&#x27;Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain, with each being allocated an initial minimum of two seats and the remaining 248 being distributed in proportion to their populations. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting. The use of the electoral method resulted in an effective threshold based on the district magnitude and the distribution of votes among candidacies.

As a result of the aforementioned allocation, each Congress multi-member constituency was entitled the following seats:

For the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting system, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.

The law did not provide for by-elections to fill vacated seats; instead, any vacancies that occurred after the proclamation of candidates and into the legislature&#x27;s term were to be covered by the successive candidates in the list and, when needed, by the designated substitutes, of which the list was required to include three.

===Election date===
The term of each chamber of the —the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of parliament and published on the following day in the Official State Gazette (BOE), with election day taking place between the fifty-fourth and the sixtieth day from publication. The previous election was held on 29 October 1989, which meant that the legislature&#x27;s term would expire on 29 October 1993. The election decree was required to be published in the BOE no later than 5 October 1993, with the election taking place on the sixtieth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the on Saturday, 4 December 1993.

The prime minister had the prerogative to propose the monarch to dissolve both chambers at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both chambers were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a prime minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections to the Congress and the Senate. Still, as of 2025 there has been no precedent of separate elections taking place under the 1978 Constitution.

The were officially dissolved on 13 April 1993 after the publication of the dissolution decree in the BOE, setting the election date for 6 June and scheduling for both chambers to reconvene on 29 June.

==Parliamentary composition==
The tables below show the composition of the parliamentary groups in both chambers at the time of dissolution.


==Parties and candidates==
===Eligibility requirements===
Spanish citizens of age and with the legal capacity to vote could run for election, provided that they were not sentenced to imprisonment by a final court&#x27;s decision nor convicted by a judgement, even if not yet final, which imposed a penalty of forfeiture of eligibility or of specific disqualification or suspension from public office under specific offences: rebellion and terrorism when involving crimes against life, physical integrity or freedom of persons. Other general causes of ineligibility were imposed on members of the Spanish royal family; the president and members of the Constitutional Court, the General Council of the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, the Council of State, the Court of Auditors and the Economic and Social Council; the Ombudsman; the State&#x27;s Attorney General; high-ranking members—undersecretaries, secretaries-general, directors-general and chiefs of staff—of Spanish government departments, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, government delegations, the Social Security and other government agencies; heads of diplomatic missions in foreign states or international organizations; judges and public prosecutors in active service; Armed Forces and police corps personnel in active service; members of electoral commissions; the chair of RTVE; the director of the Electoral Register Office; the governor and deputy governor of the Bank of Spain; the chairs of the Official Credit Institute and other official credit institutions; and members of the Nuclear Safety Council; as well as a number of territorial-level officers in the aforementioned government bodies and institutions being barred from running, during their tenure of office, in constituencies within the whole or part of their respective area of jurisdiction. Disqualification provisions for the Cortes Generales extended to any employee of a foreign state and to members of regional governments, as well as the impossibility of running simultaneously as candidate for both the Congress and Senate.

The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

<text>Aristides de Sousa Mendes do Amaral e Abranches (; July 19, 1885 – April 3, 1954) was a Portuguese consul during World War II.

As the Portuguese consul-general in the French city of Bordeaux, he defied the orders of António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s Estado Novo regime, issuing visas and passports to an undetermined number of refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied France, including Jews. For this, Sousa Mendes was punished by the Salazar regime with one year of inactivity with the right to one half of his rank&#x27;s pay, being obliged subsequently to be retired. However, he ended up never being expelled from the foreign service nor forced to retire and he received a full consul salary until his death in 1954. One of Sousa Mendes most sympathetic biographers, Rui Afonso, has reckoned that he continued to receive a salary at least three times that of a teacher.

Sousa Mendes was vindicated in 1988, more than a decade after the Carnation Revolution, which toppled the Estado Novo.

The number of visas issued by Sousa Mendes is disputed. Yad Vashem historian Avraham Milgram thinks that it was probably Harry Ezratty who was the first to mention in an article published in 1964 that Sousa Mendes had saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews, a number which has since been repeated automatically by journalists and academics. Milgram says that Ezratty, imprudently, took the total number of Jewish refugees who passed through Portugal and ascribed it to the work of Aristides de Sousa Mendes. According to Milgram “the discrepancy between the reality and the myth of the number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great”. A similar opinion is shared by British historian Neill Lochery, by the Portuguese ambassador João Hall Themido, by the Portuguese Ambassador Carlos Fernandes and by the Portuguese historian José Hermano Saraiva. On the other hand, French writer, Eric Lebreton argued that “Milgram did not account for the visas that were delivered in Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse”. In 2015, Olivia Mattis, musicologist and Board President of the Sousa Mendes Foundation in the United States, published the findings of the Sousa Mendes Foundation stating that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of visa recipients is a figure in the correct order of magnitude.

For his efforts to save Jewish refugees, Sousa Mendes was recognized by Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, the first diplomat to be so honoured, in 1966.

Portuguese diplomats such as Ambassador João Hall Themido and Ambassador Carlos Fernandes have argued that Sousa Mendes actions have been inflated and twisted in order to attack Salazar. Similar opinion was voiced by historian Tom Gallagher who argues that evidence that Sousa Mendes efforts were especially directed towards fleeing Jews is also speculative. British, Americans and Portuguese, often people with means, figured prominently as recipients of visas. Gallagher thinks that the disproportionate attention given to Sousa Mendes suggests that wartime history is being used as a political weapon in contemporary Portugal.

On 9 June 2020, Portugal granted official recognition to Sousa Mendes. Parliament decided a monument in the National Pantheon should bear his name. In 2017, in the Portuguese border town of Vilar Formoso, a memorial museum was opened, known as Vilar Formoso Fronteira da Paz (Frontier of Peace) recording the experiences of refugees entering Portugal, many of whom had been given visas by Sousa Mendes.

On 19 July 2024, the Aristides de Sousa Mendes Museum was inaugurated in Cabanas de Viriato, Portugal.

== Early life==
Aristides de Sousa Mendes was born in Cabanas de Viriato, in Carregal do Sal, in the district of Viseu, Centro Region of Portugal, on July 19, 1885, shortly after midnight. His twin brother César, born a few minutes earlier, had a July 18 birthday. Their ancestry included a notable aristocratic line: their mother, Maria Angelina Coelho Ribeiro, was a maternal illegitimate granddaughter of the 2nd Viscount of Midões, a lower rural aristocracy title. Their father, José de Sousa Mendes, was a judge on the Coimbra Court of Appeals. César served as Foreign Minister in 1932, in the early days of António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s regime. Their younger brother, Jose Paulo, became a naval officer.

Sousa Mendes and his twin studied law at the University of Coimbra, and each obtained his degree in 1908. In that same year, Sousa Mendes married his childhood sweetheart, Maria Angelina Coelho de Sousa (born August 20, 1888). They eventually had fourteen children, born in the various countries in which he served. Shortly after his marriage, Sousa Mendes began the consular officer career that would take him and his family around the world. Early in his career, he served in Demerara, Zanzibar, Brazil, Spain, the United States, and Belgium.

In August 1919, while posted in Brazil, he was &quot;temporarily suspended by the Foreign Ministry, which regarded him as hostile to the republican regime.&quot; Subsequently, &quot;he had financial problems and was forced to take out a loan in order to provide for his family needs.&quot; He returned home to Portugal where his son Pedro Nuno was born in Coimbra in April 1920.

In 1921, Sousa Mendes was assigned to the Portuguese consulate in San Francisco, and two more of his children were born there.

In 1923, he angered some members of the Portuguese-American community because of his insistence that the Oakland&#x27;s brotherhood of the Cult of the Holy Spirit should make a contribution to a Brazilian charity. Sousa Mendes decided to publish his arguments in local newspapers accusing the members of the brotherhood of lack of patriotism and disrespect for Portugal sparkling a dispute where both sides used the local press to attack each another. Sousa Mendes was instructed by the Foreign Office to stop insisting on something that was not part of his work as a consul and that the local Portuguese community was free to choose to which charities they wished to support. But Sousa Mendes ignored the orders and kept on publishing articles criticizing the members of the brotherhood and also banned the Portuguese notaries from performing any further services to the consulate. Ultimately, the conflict led to the US Department of State cancelling his consular exequatur and ask the Portuguese Government to replace Sousa Mendes as consul. While in San Francisco, Sousa Mendes helped establish a Portuguese Studies program at the University of California at Berkeley.

In May 1926, a coup d&#x27;état replaced the republic in Portugal with a military dictatorship, a regime that according to Sousa Mendes &quot;had been greeted with delight&quot; in Portugal. He supported the new regime at first and his career prospects improved. In March 1927, Sousa Mendes was assigned to serve as the Consul in Vigo in Spain, where he helped the military dictatorship neutralize political refugees.

In 1929 he was sent to Antwerp, Belgium to serve as Dean of the Consular Corps.

The year of 1934 was a tragic year for the Sousa Mendes family with the loss of two of their children: Raquel, barely one year old, and Manuel, who had just graduated from the University of Louvain.

In 1935 during the Brussels World Fair Sousa Mendes decided to publicly criticize the Portuguese Government for the low level of representation in the world fair. The Minister Armindo Monteiro considered this to be a serious lack of discipline and Sousa Mendes was again object of disciplinary proceedings that ended up with him being dismissed from the board of The House of Portugal in Antwerp. In that same year, Sousa Mendes was also investigated for tardiness in the transferring of consular funds to the Foreign Office in Lisbon and he had to ask the support of his brother César to provide him with the money needed to settle the lack of funds. 

In 1938, he was assigned to the post of Consul-General of Bordeaux, France, with jurisdiction over the whole of the Southwest of France.

== World War II and Circular 14 ==

In 1932, the Portuguese dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar began, and by 1933, the secret police, the Surveillance and State Defense Police, PVDE, had been created. According to historian Avraham Milgram, by 1938, Salazar &quot;knew the Nazis&#x27; approach to the &#x27;Jewish question&#x27;. From fears that aliens might undermine the regime, entry to Portugal was severely limited. Toward this end, the apparatus of the PVDE was extended with its International Department given greater control over border patrol and the entry of aliens. Presumably, most aliens wishing to enter Portugal at that time were Jews.&quot; Portugal during World War II, like its European counterparts, adopted tighter immigration policies, preventing refugees from settling in the country. Circular 10, of 28 October 1938, addressed to consular representatives, deemed that settling was forbidden to Jews, allowing entrance only on a tourist visa for thirty days.

On 9 November 1938, the Nazi government of Germany began open war against its Jewish citizens with the pogrom known as Kristallnacht, with over a thousand synagogues damaged or destroyed, thousands of Jewish businesses damaged, 30,000 Jews arrested and at least 91 Jews murdered. On 1 September 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, home at that time to the largest Jewish community in the world, precipitating the start of World War II. Salazar reacted by sending a telegram to the Portuguese Embassy in Berlin ordering that it should be made clear to the German Reich that Portuguese law did not allow any distinction based on race, and therefore Portuguese Jewish citizens could not be discriminated against.

The German invasion of Poland led France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany. The number of refugees trying to make use of Portugal&#x27;s neutrality as an escape route increased, and between the months of September and December approximately 9,000 refugees entered Portugal. Passport forgery and false statements were common. The regime felt the need for tighter control. By 1939, the police had already dismantled several criminal networks responsible for passport forgery and several consuls had been expelled from service for falsifying passports.

On 11 November 1939, the Portuguese government sent Circular 14 to all Portuguese consuls throughout Europe, stating the categories of war refugees whom the PVDE considered to be &quot;inconvenient or dangerous.&quot; The Dispatch allowed consuls to continue granting Portuguese transit visas, but established that in the case of &quot;Foreigners of indefinite or contested nationality, the Stateless, Russian Citizens, Holders of a Nansen passport, or Jews expelled from their countries and those alleging to embark from a Portuguese port without a consular visa for their country of destination, or air or sea tickets, or an Embarkation Guarantee from the respective companies, the consuls needed to ask permission in advance of the Foreign Ministry head office in Lisbon.&quot; With Europe at war, this meant that refugees fleeing from the Nazis would have serious difficulties.

Historian Neill Lochery asserts that Circular 14 &quot;was not issued out of thin air&quot; and that this type of barrier was not unique to Portugal and with the country&#x27;s very limited economic resources it was viewed as necessary. It was economic reasons rather than ideological reasons that made the Portuguese avoid accepting more refugees says Lochery. Milgram expressed similar views, asserting that Portugal&#x27;s regime did not distinguish between Jews and non-Jews but rather between immigrant Jews who came and had the means to leave the country, and those lacking those means. Portugal prevented Jews from putting down roots in the country not because they were Jews but because the regime feared foreign influence in general, and feared the entrance of Bolsheviks and left-wing agitators fleeing from Germany. Milgram believes that antisemitic ideological patterns had no hold in the ruling structure of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; and &quot;a fortiori&quot; in the various strata of Portuguese society. Milgram also says that modern anti-Semitism failed &quot;to establish even a toehold in Portugal&quot; while it grew racist and virulent elsewhere in early twentieth-century Europe. Salazar`s policies towards the Jews seem to have been favourable and consistent.&quot; Nevertheless, although it was not anti-Semitism that motivated the Portuguese government, but the danger of mass emigration to the country, the outcome of the border policy made life difficult for Jews fleeing Nazism.

== Sousa Mendes&#x27; disobedience to the orders of the Salazar dictatorship==

There are different views on the uniqueness of Sousa Mendes&#x27; actions: According to Dr. Mordecai Paldiel, past Director of the Department of the Righteous at Yad Vashem, &quot;In Portugal of those days, it was unthinkable for a diplomatic official, especially in a sensitive post, to disobey clear-cut instructions and get away with it.&quot; However, according to Yad Vashem historian Avraham Milgram &quot;issuing visas in contravention of instructions was widespread at Portuguese consulates all over Europe&quot; and that &quot;this form of insubordination was rife in consular circles.&quot; Sousa Mendes began disobeying Circular 14 almost immediately, on the grounds that it was an inhumane and racist directive.

The process that ended with Sousa Mendes’ discharge from his consular career began with two visas issued during the Phoney War and long before the invasion of France: the first issued on 28 November 1939 to Professor Arnold Wiznitzer, an Austrian historian who had been stripped of his nationality by the Nuremberg Laws, and the second on 1 March 1940 to the Spanish Republican Eduardo Neira Laporte, an anti-Franco activist living in France. Sousa Mendes granted the visas first, and only after granting the visas did he ask for the required approvals. Sousa Mendes was reprimanded and warned in writing that &quot;any new transgression or violation on this issue will be considered disobedience and will entail a disciplinary procedure where it will not be possible to overlook that you have repeatedly committed acts which have entailed warnings and reprimands.&quot;

When Sousa Mendes issued these visas, it was a deliberate act of disobedience to the decree of an authoritarian dictatorship. &quot;Here was a unique act by a man who believed his religion imposed certain obligations&quot;, said Paldiel. &quot;He said, &#x27;I&#x27;m saving innocent lives,&#x27; as simply as he might have said, &#x27;Come, walk with me in my garden.&#x27;&quot;

Sousa Mendes also began keeping Andrée Cibial, a French pianist and singer, as his mistress around this time and she eventually got pregnant, which she publicly announced during a Sunday&#x27;s mass at Ribérac cathedral.

On 10 May 1940, Germany launched a blitzkrieg offensive against France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and millions of refugees took to the roads. On 15 May, Sousa Mendes issued transit visas to Maria Tavares, a Luxembourg citizen of Portuguese origin, and to her husband Paul Miny, also a Luxembourger. Two weeks later, the couple returned to the Bordeaux Consulate asking Sousa Mendes to issue them false papers. Sousa Mendes agreed to their request, and on 30 May 1940, he issued a Portuguese passport listing Paul Miny as Maria&#x27;s brother, therefore as having Portuguese citizenship. This time Sousa Mendes risked himself a great deal more than he had before; disobeying Circular 14 was one thing, but issuing a passport with a false identity, for someone of military age was a crime. Sousa Mendes later provided the following explanation: &quot;This couple asked me for a Portuguese passport, where they would figure as brother and sister, for fear that the husband, who was still of military age, would be detained on passing the French border, and incorporated in the Luxembourg army then being organized in France.&quot; Portuguese authorities were remarkably lax when dealing with this transgression. Paul Miny was a deserter (not a Jew) and Sousa Mendes&#x27; offence carried out a penalty of two year in prison and expulsion from public service.

There were other cases from May 1940 where Sousa Mendes disobeyed Circular 14. Examples include issuing visas to the Ertag, Flaksbaum and Landesman families, all granted on 29 May, despite having been rejected in a telegram from the Portuguese dictator Salazar to Sousa Mendes. Another example is the writer Gisèle Quittner, rejected by Salazar but rescued by Sousa Mendes, to whom she expressed her gratitude: &quot;You are Portugal&#x27;s best propaganda and an honor to your country. All those who know you praise your courage...&quot;

==Encounter with Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Kruger==

As the German army approached Paris, the largest single movement of refugees in Europe since the Early Middle Ages began. An estimated six to ten million people took to the roads and railways to escape the German invasion. Bordeaux and other southern French cities were overrun by desperate refugees. One of these was a Chassidic Rabbi, Chaim Kruger, originally from Poland but more recently from Brussels, escaping with his wife and five children. Kruger and Sousa Mendes met by chance in Bordeaux, and quickly became friends. Sousa Mendes offered a visa to the Kruger family in defiance of Circular 14. In response, Kruger took a moral stand and refused to accept the visa unless all of his &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; (the mass of Jewish refugees stranded on the streets of Bordeaux) received visas too. Kruger&#x27;s response plunged Sousa Mendes into &quot;a moral crisis of incalculable proportions.&quot;

At the same time, Sousa Mendes was also living out a personal drama. Andrée Cibial, Sousa Mendes’ lover, pregnant with his child, showed up at the consulate and provoked a scandal in front of Sousa Mendes&#x27; family, getting herself imprisoned for the incident. By this time, Sousa Mendes had a nervous breakdown and secluded himself in prayer, questioning whether or not he should issue as many visas as he could, saving lives at the expense of his own career. &quot;Here the situation is horrible and I am in bed because of a strong nervous breakdown,&quot; he wrote to his son-in-law on 13 June 1940.

==Act of conscience==
On 12 June, despite the guarantees given by Franco, personally, to the Portuguese Ambassador Teotónio Pereira, that even if Italy entered the war, Spain would remain neutral, Spain took on the status of a non-belligerent power and invaded Tangiers, further endangering Portuguese neutrality. With German tanks approaching the Pyrenees and with anti-British demonstrations in Spain, demanding the return of Gibraltar, there was every prospect that Portugal and Spain would become embroiled in the hostilities.

On June 12 Salazar issued instructions to the Portuguese consulates in France to provide the Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal Duchess of Parma with Portuguese Passports. With these Portuguese Passports the entire entourage of the royal families could get visas without creating problems to the neutrality of the Portuguese Government. This way Zita of Bourbon-Parma and her son Otto von Habsburg got their visas because they were descendants of Portuguese citizens. Following the German annexation of Austria, Otto was sentenced to death by the Nazi regime.

On June 13, Salazar had to act fast again, this time to support the Belgium Royal family. Salazar sent instructions to the Portuguese Consulate in Bayonne saying the &quot;Portuguese territory is completely open&quot; to the Belgium Royal Family and its entourage. 

On 16 June, despite his seclusion, Sousa Mendes issued 40 visas, including those for the Rothschild family, and he was paid his customary personal compensation fee for issuing visas on a Sunday.

On 17 June, Pétain announced in a broadcast to the French people that &quot;it is with a heavy heart that I tell you today that we must stop fighting,&quot; and he calls on the Germans for an armistice that will end the fighting. On that same day, Sousa Mendes emerged from his seclusion, impelled by &quot;a divine power,&quot; with his decision made. According to his son Pedro Nuno, 
His daughter Isabel and her husband Jules strongly opposed his decision, and tried to dissuade him from what they considered to be a fatal mistake. But Sousa Mendes did not listen to them and instead began to work intensively to grant the visas. &quot;I would rather stand with God and against man than with man and against God,&quot; he reportedly explained. He set up an assembly line process, aided by his wife, sons Pedro Nuno and José Antonio, his secretary José Seabra, Rabbi Kruger, and a few other refugees.

According to the Bordeaux Register of Visas on the 17th were issued 247 Visas; on the 18th, 216; between the 19th and the 22nd, an average of 350 were written into the Register of Visas.

The testimony from American writer Eugene Bagger is quite unfavourable regarding the efficiency of the &quot;assembly line&quot; set up by Sousa Mendes. Bagger says that on 18 June, he queued for a couple of hours at the Portuguese Consulate, hoping to get a visa. Bagger says that the pushing and elbowing drove him to despair and he gave up after a few hours. The next morning he joined again a mob of four hundred in front of the Portuguese Consulate. He waited in line from 09:00 till 11:00, again to no avail and he finally quit. He then decided to have a drink at the Hotel Splendid, where he found Sousa Mendes having an aperitif with a friend. Sousa Mendes told Bagger that he was tired from overworking the previous day, from the crowds and from the heat. Then, at Bagger&#x27;s request, Sousa Mendes signed Bagger&#x27;s passport and told him to go back to the consulate to have it stamped. To Bagger&#x27;s surprise, he was then helped by M. Skalski, the Polish consul at Arcachon. At the consulate, M. Skalski was able to cut through the crowds and get Bagger&#x27;s passports duly stamped.

On 20 June, the British Embassy in Lisbon sent a letter to the Portuguese Foreign Office accusing Sousa Mendes of &quot;deferring until after office hours all applications for visas&quot; as well as &quot;charging them at a special rate&quot; and requiring at least one refugee &quot;to contribute to a Portuguese charitable fund before the visa was granted.&quot; This complaint from the British Embassy and the timing of Sousa Mendes&#x27; unilateral decision could not have been worse for Salazar and his carefully planned attempt to preserve Portuguese neutrality. Salazar had instructed consulates in Spain and those in the south of France ― Bordeaux, Bayonne, Perpignan, Marseilles, Nice ― to issue transit visas to British citizens.

Bordeaux was bombed by the Wehrmacht on the night of 19–20 June 1940. In the morning, the demand for Portuguese visas intensified, not only in Bordeaux but also in nearby Bayonne, near the Spanish border. Sousa Mendes rushed to the Portuguese Consulate in Bayonne, which was under his jurisdiction, to relieve the Vice-Consul Faria Machado, who was refusing to grant visas to the crush of refugees. However, Eugene Bagger says that, at Bayonne, he saw Sousa Mendes rushing out of the Portuguese Consulate, pursued by a mob, and that Sousa Mendes, holding his head between his hands, was crying &quot;Go away! No more visas!&quot;, then jumped into a car and shot down the hill pursued by curses from the mass of visa seekers.

In issuing visas at the Bayonne consulate, Sousa Mendes was aided by the Bayonne consular secretary, Manuel de Vieira Braga. Faria Machado, a Salazar loyalist in charge of the Bayonne consulate, reported this behaviour to Portugal&#x27;s ambassador to Spain, Pedro Teotónio Pereira. Teotónio Pereira, a loyalist to the historic Anglo-Portuguese alliance, promptly set out for the French-Spanish border to put a stop to this activity. After observing Sousa Mendes&#x27; action, Teotónio Pereira sent a telegram to the Lisbon authorities in which he described Sousa Mendes as being &quot;out of his mind&quot; and also said that Sousa Mendes&#x27; &quot;disorientation has made a great impression on the Spanish side with a political campaign against Portugal being created immediately accusing our country of giving shelter to the scum of the democratic regimes and defeated elements fleeing before the German victory.&quot; He declared Sousa Mendes to be mentally incompetent and, acting on Salazar&#x27;s authority, he invalidated all further visas. Teotónio Pereira&#x27;s role in drawing Spain with Portugal into a truly neutral peninsular bloc in line with the allies&#x27; strategy was praised both by the British and the American ambassadors.

Sousa Mendes continued on to Hendaye to assist there, thus narrowly missing two cablegrams from Lisbon sent on 22 June to Bordeaux, ordering him to stop even as France&#x27;s armistice with Germany became official. Sousa Mendes ordered the honorary Portuguese vice-consul in Toulouse, Emile Gissot, to issue transit visas to all who applied.

The armistice was signed on 22 June. Under its terms, two-thirds of France was to be occupied by the Germans. On 26 June, the British Ambassador in Madrid wrote to London &quot;The arrival of the Germans on the Pyrenees is a tremendous event in the eyes of every Spaniard. Will it mean the passage of troops through Spain to Portugal or Africa?&quot; Meanwhile, Teotónio Pereira, following Spanish protests, declared the visas issued by Sousa Mendes to be null and void. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that some 10,000 persons attempting to cross over into Spain were excluded because authorities no longer granted recognition to their visas: &quot;Portugal announced that Portuguese visas granted at Bordeaux were invalid, and Spain was permitting bearers of these documents to enter only in exceptional cases.&quot; The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that small Portugal, whose population was just over seven million, had received an estimated two million applications for visas, permanent or transit. Most of them came from Frenchmen, Belgians, Dutch, and Poles in France who required Portuguese visas to pass through Spain. The applications must have included tens of thousands from Jews.

On 24 June, Salazar recalled Sousa Mendes to Portugal, an order he received upon returning to Bordeaux on 26 June but he complied slowly, arriving in Portugal on 8 July. Along the way, he continued issuing Portuguese visas to refugees now trapped in occupied France, and even led a large group to a remote border post that had not received Lisbon&#x27;s order. His son, John-Paul Abranches, told the story: &quot;As his diplomatic car reached the French border town of Hendaye, my father encountered a large group of stranded refugees for whom he had previously issued visas. Those people had been turned away because the Portuguese government had phoned the guards, commanding &#x27;Do not honour Mendes&#x27;s signature on visas.&#x27;... Ordering his driver to slow down, Father waved the group to follow him to a border checkpoint that had no telephones. In the official black limousine with its diplomatic license tags, Father led those refugees across the border toward freedom.&quot;

After the intervention of Augusto d&#x27;Esaguy and Amzalak, most of the refugees issued visas by Sousa Mendes were allowed to continue on their way to Portugal and were well received,

On 26 June, the main European office of HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) was authorized by Salazar to be transferred from Paris to Lisbon. Salazar allowed Jewish relief organizations to set up offices in Lisbon and operate with little interference from the authorities. Initially this was done against the will of the British Embassy in Lisbon. The British feared that this would make the Portuguese people less sympathetic with the allied cause.

==Disciplinary proceeding and punishment==
Upon returning to Portugal in early July 1940, Sousa Mendes was subjected to a disciplinary proceeding that has been described as &quot;a severe crackdown&quot; and &quot;a merciless disciplinary process.&quot; The charges against him included: &quot;the violation of Dispatch 14; the order to the consul in Bayonne to issue visas to all those who asked for them &#x27;with the claim that it was necessary to save all these people&#x27;; the order given to the consul in Bayonne to distribute visas free of charge; the permission given by telephone to the consul in Toulouse that he could issue visas; acting in a way that was dishonourable for Portugal &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the Spanish and German authorities.&quot;; the confessed passport forgery to help Luxembourger Paul Miny escape army mobilization; abandoning his post at Bordeaux without authorization and extortion, this latest one based on the accusation made by the British Embassy. Rui Afonso wrote in 1990&#x27;s &quot;Injustiça&quot; (Injustice) that the disciplinary action against Sousa Mendes was less due to the granting of too many visas and more the result of his various financial intrigues such as requiring applicants to donate to charity, and his personal use of public monies. Afonso softened this stance in his 1995 book &quot;Um Homem Bom&quot; (One Good Man). Historian Avraham Milgram observes that Afonso holds a minority view: the mainstream view is that Sousa Mendes was disciplined for the granting of too many visas, in violation of his instructions.

The accusation asserted that &quot;an atmosphere of panic does in fact provide an extenuating circumstance for the acts committed by the Defendant during the month of June and possibly even for those committed in the second half of the month of May..., however, the acts committed during that period are no more than a repetition or extension of a procedure that already existed, for which the same extenuating circumstance cannot be invoked. There had been infractions and repetitions long before 15 May...this is the 4th case of disciplinary proceedings brought against the Defendant&quot;.

Sousa Mendes submitted his response to the charges on 12 August 1940, in which he clarified his motivation:
On 19 October 1940, the verdict was handed down: &quot;disobeying higher orders during service.&quot; The disciplinary board recommended a demotion. On 30 October 1940, Salazar rejected this recommendation and imposed his own sentence: &quot;I sentence Consul First Class, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, to a penalty of one year of inactivity with the right to one half of his rank&#x27;s pay, being obliged subsequently to be retired.&quot; He further ordered that all files in the case be sealed.

There was also an unofficial punishment: the blacklisting and social banishment of Aristides de Sousa Mendes and his family. &quot;My grandfather...knew there would be some retribution, but to lose everything and have the family disgraced, he never thought it would go that far&quot;, said the hero&#x27;s grandson, also named Aristides. The family took meals at the soup kitchen of the Jewish community of Lisbon. When told that the soup kitchen was intended for refugees, Sousa Mendes replied, &quot;But we too are refugees.&quot;

Sousa Mendes was listed in the Portuguese Consular and Diplomatic Yearbook until 1954. After the one year punishment with half-pay, he received a monthly payment of 1,593 Portuguese escudos per month. According to Rui Afonso, &quot;although it was not a salary of a prince, one should not forget that at that time, in Portugal, the monthly salary of a school teacher was only 500 Escudos&quot;. When he died, in 1954 he was receiving a monthly salary of 2,300 escudos.

According to Milgram, Mendes&#x27; actions, while exceptional in its scope, were not unique, as issuing visas in contravention of the Portuguese government&#x27;s instructions occurred at other Portuguese consulates as well.

After the war, with the victory of the Allied forces over the Axis, Salazar took credit for Portugal having received the refugees, and the Portuguese history books were written accordingly. Manuela Franco, Director of the Portuguese Foreign Ministry archives, stated in 2000 that &quot;the image of &#x27;Portugal, a safe haven&#x27; was born then in Bordeaux, and it lasts to this day.&quot;

==Last years==
Throughout the war years and beyond, Sousa Mendes was optimistic that his punishment would be reversed and his deed would be recognized. In a 1945 letter to the Portuguese Parliament, he explained that he had disobeyed orders because he had considered them to be unconstitutional, as the Portuguese Constitution forbade discrimination on the basis of religion. This was the first time that Sousa Mendes used this line of argument and he explained that he hadn&#x27;t used it before because, being a public official, he did not want to attract publicity and therefore compromise Portugal&#x27;s neutrality.

In 1941, Sousa Mendes applied to the Portuguese Bar Association and he was admitted to the bar to practice law. But in 1942, he wrote a letter to the bar, explaining that since he was living in a small village, in his mansion at Passal, he was not able to work as a lawyer and he asked for his license to be cancelled. Later, in 1944, he asked for readmission, which was granted. Then, as a lawyer, he won a court case, in which he defended two of his sons, Carlos and Sebastian, who were being deprived of Portuguese citizenship because they had enlisted in the allied armed forces in the UK.

Just before the war&#x27;s end in 1945, Sousa Mendes suffered a stroke that left him at least partially paralysed and unable to work.

In 1946, a Portuguese journalist tried to raise awareness for Sousa Mendes outside of Portugal by publishing the facts under a pseudonym in a US newspaper. Sousa Mendes&#x27; wife Angelina died in 1948.

The following year he married his former mistress Andrée Cibial, with whom he had a daughter, Marie-Rose. Cibial soon clashed with Sousa Mendes&#x27; sons and the couple moved to Cabanas de Viriato. It did not take long for Andrée to show to Sousa Mendes&#x27; sons that they were not welcome at Passal, and soon the youngsters were separated from their father. John Paul joined other brothers and sisters already living in California. Pedro Nuno left for the Congo. Geraldo went to Angola, and Clotilde went to Mozambique. On account of Andrée`s spending habits, Sousa Mendes also started to have disputes with his brothers César and João Paulo and his cousin Silvério.

As his financial situation deteriorated, he would sometimes write to the people he had helped asking for money. On one occasion, Maurice de Rothschild sent him 30,000 Portuguese escudos, a considerable amount of money in Portugal at that time.

In 1950, Sousa Mendes and Cibial travelled to France. Their daughter, Marie-Rose, had been raised in France by her aunt and uncle and was ten when she met her father for the first time. Her parents began spending the summer months with her each year.

In his final years, Sousa Mendes was abandoned by most of his colleagues and friends, and at times was blamed by some of his close relatives. His children moved to other countries in search of opportunities they were now denied in Portugal, although by all accounts they never blamed their father or regretted his decisions. He asked his children to help clear the family name and make the story known. In 1951, one of his sons, Sebastião, published a novella about the Bordeaux events, &quot;Flight Through Hell.&quot; César de Sousa Mendes, twin brother of Aristides, did everything he could to try to get Salazar to reverse his punishment, but to no avail. But Sousa Mendes never regretted his action. &quot;I could not have acted otherwise, and I therefore accept all that has befallen me with love,&quot; he reportedly said. To his lawyer he wrote: &quot;In truth, I disobeyed, but my disobedience does not dishonour me. I did not respect orders that to me represented the persecution of true castaways who sought with all their strength to be saved from Hitler&#x27;s wrath. Above the order, for me, there was God&#x27;s law, and that&#x27;s the one I have always sought to adhere to without hesitation. The true value of the Christian religion is to love one&#x27;s neighbour.&quot;

Sousa Mendes always lived with financial problems and Cibial&#x27;s spending habits aggravated the situation. The couple eventually ended up selling all their furniture from their family mansion and raising debts with banks. Sousa Mendes died in poverty on 3 April 1954, owing money to his lenders and still in disgrace with his government. The only person present when he died was one of his nieces.

== Number of visa recipients ==

There are different views regarding the number of visas issued by Sousa Mendes. It has been widely published that Sousa Mendes saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews. Historian Avraham Milgram thinks that it was probably Harry Ezratty who was the first to mention in an article published in 1964 that Sousa Mendes had saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews, a number which has since been repeated automatically by journalists and academics. Milgram says that Ezratty, imprudently, took the total number of Jewish refugees who passed through Portugal and ascribed it to the work of Aristides de Sousa Mendes. Milgram thinks that &quot;the discrepancy between the reality and the myth of the number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great.&quot; To make his point, Milgram cross-checked the numbers from the Bordeaux visa register entry books with those of the HICEM reports, and although he acknowledged that visas delivered in the cities of Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse cannot be exactly determined, he asserted that the numbers are exaggerated.

In 2011, Milgram published a densely researched book, &quot;Portugal, Salazar and the Jews&quot; and for a second time he asserted that &quot;authors, especially those who wish to sing the praises of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, tend to overstate the number of visas with figures that do not satisfy research criteria, but rather correspond to their wishful thinking&quot;.

A similar opinion is shared by British historian Neill Lochery. In 2011, Lochery quoted Milgram&#x27;s numbers, and to further support his view he also cross checked numbers with the Portuguese Emigration Police files and he also concluded that the numbers usually published by popular literature are a &quot;myth&quot;. Both these historians concur that this does not diminish the greatness of Sousa Mendes&#x27;s gesture. Rui Afonso, the first Sousa Mendes biographer, also says that José Seabra, Sousa Mendes&#x27; deputy at Bordeaux, always testified that the order of magnitude of irregular visas issued at Bordeaux was within hundreds.

In 2008, the Portuguese ambassador João Hall Themido took a stand affirming that in his opinion, the Sousa Mendes story was a &quot;myth invented by Jews&quot; and asserting his disbelief in the 30,000 figure.

A similar path was followed by Portuguese Professor José Hermano Saraiva, a former António de Oliveira Salazar and Marcelo Caetano minister, and a great admirer of Salazar. Professor Saraiva also asserts that it was the Portuguese neutrality and hospitality that saved thousands of lives throughout the war—that a stamp in a passport would never be enough to save anyone should the Portuguese Government at that time have decided to follow a different path.

A complex operation was needed to house and feed all those people moving and staying in Portugal for a considerable period of time. According to Saraiva and some other historians, Leite Pinto, former Portuguese minister of education, should also be given credit for most refugees saved during the war. Professor Baltasar Rebelo de Sousa mentioned the &quot;Leite Pinto operation&quot;, that used sealed trains to bring thousands of refugees into Portugal, and praised this operation in a tribute to Leite Pinto. Forced by the circumstances, several Portuguese assistance associations, sponsored by the government, were then created in Portugal for the integration and hosting of this large number of refugees, mostly Jews, many hosted and received by Portuguese families.

On the other hand, as a reaction to Milgram&#x27;s assertions, French writer, Eric Lebreton, in 2010, argued that &quot;Milgram did not account for the visas that were delivered in Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse, and on the other hand, he [Milgram] holds firm to the number presented in the one surviving registry book of José Seabra (Sousa Mendes&#x27; deputy). According to Lebreton, Milgram&#x27;s article, while very interesting in other ways, lacks details and knowledge on this point.&quot;

Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer characterized Sousa Mendes&#x27; deed as &quot;perhaps the largest rescue action by a single individual during the Holocaust.&quot;

In 2015, Olivia Mattis, musicologist and Board President of the Sousa Mendes Foundation in the United States, published the findings of the Sousa Mendes Foundation stating that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of visa recipients is a figure in the correct order of magnitude.

==Posthumous rehabilitation and recognition==

After Sousa Mendes&#x27; death in 1954, his children worked tirelessly to clear his name and make the story known. In the early 1960s, a few articles began appearing in the U.S. press. On 21 February 1961, David Ben-Gurion, the Prime Minister of Israel, ordered that twenty trees be planted by the Jewish National Fund in memory of Sousa Mendes and in recognition of his deed. In 1963, Yad Vashem began recognizing Holocaust rescuers as Righteous Among the Nations, and Sousa Mendes, in 1966, was among the earliest to be so named, thanks in large part to the efforts of his daughter Joana. But with Salazar still in power, &quot;the diplomat and his efforts remained unknown even in his own country for years.&quot; Moreover, Salazar&#x27;s representatives gave statements to the press casting doubt on Sousa Mendes&#x27; heroism by denying that Circular 14 had ever existed.

Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, when the Estado Novo dictatorship was overthrown and democracy was established, Dr. Nuno A. A. de Bessa Lopes, a Portuguese government official, took the initiative of reopening the Sousa Mendes case and making recommendations. His assessment, based on his viewing of previously sealed government files, was that the Salazar government had knowingly sacrificed Sousa Mendes for its own political ends, and that the verdict and punishment were illegal and should be overturned. &quot;Aristides de Sousa Mendes was condemned for having refused to be an accomplice to Nazi war crimes,&quot; the report concluded. The report was suppressed by the Portuguese government for over a decade. &quot;The failure to act on the Lopes report reflects the fact that there was never a serious purge of Fascist supporters from government ministries,&quot; explained journalist Reese Erlich.

In 1986, inspired by the election of Mário Soares, a civilian president in Portugal, Sousa Mendes&#x27; youngest son John Paul began to circulate a petition to the Portuguese president within his adopted country, the United States. &quot;I want people in Portugal to know who he was, what he did, and why he did it,&quot; explained John Paul. He and his wife Joan worked with Robert Jacobvitz, an executive at the Jewish Federation of the Greater East Bay in Oakland, California, and lawyer Anne Treseder to create the &quot;International Committee to Commemorate Dr. Aristides de Sousa Mendes.&quot; They were able to gain the support of two members of the California delegation of the United States House of Representatives, Tony Coelho and Henry Waxman, who introduced a resolution in Congress to recognize his humanitarian actions. That same year, Sousa Mendes was honored at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, where John Paul and his brother Sebastião gave impassioned speeches and Waxman spoke as well. In 1987, the Portuguese Republic began to rehabilitate Sousa Mendes&#x27; memory and granted him a posthumous Order of Liberty medal, one of that country&#x27;s highest honors, although the consul&#x27;s diplomatic honors still were not restored. In October of that year, the &quot;Comité national français en hommage à Aristides de Sousa Mendes&quot; was established in Bordeaux, France, presided over for the next twenty-five years by Manuel Dias Vaz. On 18 March 1988, the Portuguese parliament officially dismissed all charges, restoring Sousa Mendes to the diplomatic corps by unanimous vote, and honoring him with a standing ovation. He was promoted to the rank of Ministro Plenipotenciário de 2ª classe and awarded the Cross of Merit. In December of that year, the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, Edward Rowell, presented copies of the congressional resolution from the previous year to Pedro Nuno de Sousa Mendes, one of the sons who had helped his father in the &quot;visa assembly line&quot; at Bordeaux, and to Portuguese President Mário Soares at the Palácio de Belém. In 1994, former President Mário Soares dedicated a bust of Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux, along with a commemorative plaque at 14 quai Louis‑XVIII, the address at which the consulate at Bordeaux had been located.

In 1995, Portugal held a week-long National Homage to Sousa Mendes, culminating with an event in a 2000-seat Lisbon theater that was filled to capacity. A commemorative stamp was issued to mark the occasion. The Portuguese President Mário Soares declared Sousa Mendes to be &quot;Portugal&#x27;s greatest hero of the twentieth century.&quot; On 10 June 1996, Parc De Sousa-Mendes, a playground in Montreal, Canada, was dedicated in his honor. In 1997, an international homage to Sousa Mendes was organized by the European Union in Strasbourg, France.

Casa do Passal, the mansion that Sousa Mendes had to abandon and sell in his final years, was left for decades to decay into a &quot;ghost of a building,&quot; and at one time was to be razed and replaced by a hotel. However, with reparation funds given by the Portuguese government to Sousa Mendes&#x27; heirs in 2000, the family decided to create the Fundação Aristides de Sousa Mendes. With assistance from government officials, the foundation purchased the family home in order to develop a museum in his honor. On 3 March 2011, the Casa do Passal was designated a National Monument of Portugal.

In April 2004, to mark the 50th anniversary of Sousa Mendes&#x27; death, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation and the Angelo Roncalli Committee organized more than 80 commemorations around the world. Religious, cultural and educational activities took place in 30 countries on five continents, spearheaded by João Crisóstomo. On 11 May 2005, a commemoration in memory of Aristides de Sousa Mendes was held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. On 14 January 2007, Sousa Mendes was voted into the top ten of the poll show Os Grandes Portugueses (the greatest Portuguese). On 25 March 2007, when the final rankings were announced, it was revealed that Sousa Mendes came in third place overall, behind communist leader Álvaro Cunhal (runner-up) and the dictator António de Oliveira Salazar (winner). In February 2008, Portuguese parliamentary speaker Jaime Gama led a session which launched a virtual museum, on the Internet, offering access to photographs and other documents chronicling Sousa Mendes&#x27; life. On 24 September 2010, the Sousa Mendes Foundation was formed in the United States with the purpose of raising money for the conversion of the Sousa Mendes home into a museum and site of conscience, and in order to spread his story throughout North America.

In May 2012, a campaign was launched to name a Bordeaux bridge after Sousa Mendes. In January 2013, the United Nations headquarters in New York honored Sousa Mendes and featured Sousa Mendes visa recipient Leon Moed as a keynote speaker during its International Days of Commemoration of Victims and Martyrs of the Holocaust. On 20 June 2013, a big rally was held in front of the Sousa Mendes home, Casa do Passal, to make a plea for its restoration. An American architect, Eric Moed, spearheaded the event, attended by visa recipient families from all over the world, including his grandfather Leon Moed. At this event, a representative of the Portuguese Ministry of Culture publicly pledged $400,000 in European Union funds for the restoration effort. On 20 October 2013, a playground in Toronto, Canada was renamed in honor of Sousa Mendes. That same month, the Portuguese airline Windavia named an airplane after him. In December 2013, a letter that Sousa Mendes had penned to Pope Pius XII in 1946, begging for help from the Catholic Church, was delivered to Pope Francis. In late May 2014, construction began at the Casa do Passal with funds from the European Union. In September 2014, TAP Air Portugal has named its newest Airbus A319 after Aristides de Sousa Mendes, as a tribute to the Portuguese Consul. An oratorio entitled &quot;Circular 14: The Apotheosis of Aristides&quot;, by Neely Bruce, detailed the life of Sousa Mendes. The first performance was held on 24 January 2016.

In 2022, in recognition of his effort in rescuing Polish citizens, he was honored by the President of Poland Andrzej Duda with Virtus et Fraternitas Medal.

<text>Fairlight is a digital audio company based in Sydney, Australia. In 1979, it released its Series I Fairlight CMI, one of the earliest digital audio workstations (DAWs) with a digital audio sampler. Their subsequent Series II and III CMIs featured a graphic sequencer known as Page R, during a time when most computerised music sequencers required coding skills.

These computer-instruments were used by artists such as Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush and Jean-Michel Jarre. They became such a prominent part of 1980s pop music that Phil Collins included the text &quot;there is no Fairlight on this record&quot; in the liner notes of &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;.

Fairlight has since become a manufacturer of media tools such as digital audio recording and mixing consoles.

==History==
In 1975, Fairlight Instruments Pty Ltd was established by Peter Vogel and Kim Ryrie. The company produced microprocessor-based music workstations with samplers, which were revolutionary for their time.

New sounds could be created by drawing a &#x27;sound wave&#x27; on the screen, which the computer would produce as sound. Theoretically, any sound was possible. Apart from opening up a world of new sounds, the Fairlight gave composers and performers instant playback. By changing the wave patterns presented on a screen they could tweak a sound into shape without singing or performing it all over again.

The versatility of the early Fairlight was not lost on recording artists. The first record made entirely on a computer in the United States was done by EBN-OZN (Ned Liben, who represented Fairlight in New York, and Robert Ozn) – &quot;AEIOU Sometimes Y&quot; made in 1981, released in 1983.

A hybrid analogue/digital Computer Video Instrument, invented by Kia Silverbrook, debuted in 1984. The fact that the CVI was also a &quot;computer&quot; was transparent to its use: it did not use a conventional ASCII keyboard (though in later models one could be attached), but rather a set of sliders and a small graphics pad about the size of the palm of a hand. Menu selections were made with a stylus rather than a mouse. The CVI allowed users to paint directly over the top of video footage as well as &quot;with&quot; video footage via an extensive series of effects.

In April 1989, Fairlight ESP (Electric Sound and Picture) was established by Kim Ryrie, with the financial backing of Australian distributor Amber.

In September 2016, Fairlight was acquired by Blackmagic Design.

==Peter Vogel Instruments==
In August 2009, a new company called Fairlight Instruments was launched by Peter Vogel, to produce a new range of computer musical instruments (CMI) based on Fairlight.au&#x27;s &quot;Crystal Core&quot; media engine.

In July 2012, the company Fairlight Instruments changed its name to &quot;&#x27; Peter Vogel Instruments&quot;. Peter Vogel announced the company was developing a completely new keyboard synthesizer which would be launched at Winter NAMM 2013. The name change was the result of a disagreement between the owners of the Fairlight Instruments trademark and himself that resulted in Fairlight revoking his license to use the name. According to them, the use of the Fairlight name only extended to the new version of the CMI, called the CMI-30A in reference to the instrument&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Additionally, it extended to several other CMI hardware products planned, including a PC-based &quot;Series IV.&quot; They claimed that because Vogel had also used the Fairlight name for the iOS CMI app as well, he had violated the terms of the agreement, and they were within their rights to terminate the agreement. Vogel said that he believed that the licensing agreement also extended to the app as well, but the Federal Court held the agreement had been validly terminated.

Vogel appealed to a full court of the Federal Court however the appeal was only partially successful, and Fairlight was required to pay 50% of Vogel&#x27;s costs for the appeal.

The iOS app was temporarily withdrawn from the App Store but subsequently returned. The CMI-30A, however, has remained out of production, and visitors to the Vogel Instruments website are greeted with a notification that sales of the CMI-30A have been suspended pending the resolution of litigation with Fairlight.

<text>The Wausau Woodchucks are an American baseball team that plays in the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. They play their home games at Athletic Park in Wausau, Wisconsin.

==History==
The team was known as the Wausau Woodchucks from 1994 to 1998, but the team name was changed to Wisconsin Woodchucks for the 1999 season, as they were the only remaining team in Wisconsin in the league at that time.

The team filled the void left by the Wausau Timbers of the Class A Midwest League, who relocated after the 1990 season to Geneva, Illinois, to become the Kane County Cougars.

In 1998 Clark Eckhoff purchased The Wisconsin Woodchucks, and Eckhoff truly made an impact on the team as well as the community as a whole. Not only did attendance dramatically increase with Eckhoff as owner, but the Woodchucks would go on to win two league championships in 2001 and 2003.

The Woodchucks&#x27; manager for the 2007–2009 seasons was Jim Gantner, a former Milwaukee Brewer who attended college at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh. Gantner had never managed a team previously, and the Woodchucks appealed to him as he had spent time in the area at a second home. Gantner became the team&#x27;s president of baseball operations in 2009.

On February 2, 2022, the Woodchucks announced their return as the Wausau Woodchucks, with a new logo and color scheme.

==Players==
A number of major leaguers and other notables have played for the Wausau Woodchucks, including:

* J. D. Davis, 2012 (third baseman for teams including the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants)
* Steve Foster (baseball), 2003 (pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds)
* Dave Gassner, 1998 (pitcher for the Minnesota Twins)
* Casey Janssen, 2001 (pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays)
* Mark Lowe, 2002–03 (pitcher for teams including the Seattle Mariners and the Texas Rangers)
* Pat Neshek, 2000 (2-time MLB All Star and relief pitcher for teams including the Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals)
* Wes Obermueller, 1995 (relief pitcher for teams including the Milwaukee Brewers)
* Kevin Pillar, 2010 (outfielder for teams including the Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Mets)
* Darin Ruf, 2007 (outfielder for teams including the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants)

<doc id="515339" wikidata="Q190077" url="?curid=515339" title="Zinc oxide">
<text>Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is a white powder which is insoluble in water. ZnO is used as an additive in numerous materials and products including cosmetics, food supplements, rubbers, plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, lubricants, paints, sunscreens, ointments, adhesives, sealants, pigments, foods, batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, semi conductors, and first-aid tapes. Although it occurs naturally as the mineral zincite, most zinc oxide is produced synthetically.

==History==
Early humans probably used zinc compounds in processed and unprocessed forms, as paint or medicinal ointment; however, their composition is uncertain. The use of &quot;pushpanjan&quot;, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds is mentioned in the Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD). Galen suggested treating ulcerating cancers with zinc oxide, as did Avicenna in his &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. It is used as an ingredient in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.

The Romans produced considerable quantities of brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) as early as 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is thought to have been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from the second half of the first millennium BC.

From the 12th to the 16th century, zinc and zinc oxide were recognized and produced in India using a primitive form of the direct synthesis process. From India, zinc manufacturing moved to China in the 17th century. In 1743, the first European zinc smelter was established in Bristol, United Kingdom. Around 1782, Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau proposed replacing lead white pigment with zinc oxide.

The main usage of zinc oxide (zinc white) was in paints and as an additive to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 but it did not mix well with oil. This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, Edme-Jean Leclaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale; by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead: zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur-bearing air, it is non-toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so &quot;clean&quot; it is valuable for making tints with other colors, but it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings. These paintings developed cracks over time.

In recent times, most zinc oxide has been used in the rubber industry to resist corrosion. In the 1970s, the second largest application of ZnO was photocopying. High-quality ZnO produced by the &quot;French process&quot; was added to photocopying paper as a filler. This application was soon displaced by titanium.

==Chemical properties==
Pure ZnO is a white powder. However, in nature, it occurs as the rare mineral zincite, which usually contains manganese and other impurities that confer a yellow to red color.

Crystalline zinc oxide is thermochromic, changing from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling. This color change is caused by a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non-stoichiometric Zn1+xO, where at 800 °C, x = 0.00007.

Zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide. It is nearly insoluble in water, but it will dissolve in most acids, such as hydrochloric acid:
:ZnO + 2 HCl → ZnCl2 + H2O
Solid zinc oxide will also dissolve in alkalis to give soluble zincates:
:ZnO + 2 NaOH + H2O → Na2[Zn(OH)4]

ZnO reacts slowly with fatty acids in oils to produce the corresponding carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. When mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride, ZnO forms cement-like products best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides. This cement was used in dentistry.
ZnO also forms cement-like material when treated with phosphoric acid; related materials are used in dentistry. A major component of zinc phosphate cement produced by this reaction is hopeite, Zn3(PO4)2·4H2O.

ZnO decomposes into zinc vapor and oxygen at around 1975 °C with a standard oxygen pressure. In a carbothermic reaction, heating with carbon converts the oxide into zinc vapor at a much lower temperature (around 950 °C).
:ZnO + C → Zn(Vapor) + CO

==Physical properties==

=== Structure ===
Zinc oxide crystallizes in two main forms, hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zincblende. The wurtzite structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common. The zincblende form can be stabilized by growing ZnO on substrates with cubic lattice structure. In both cases, the zinc and oxide centers are tetrahedral, the most characteristic geometry for Zn(II). ZnO converts to the rocksalt motif at relatively high pressures about 10 GPa.

Hexagonal and zincblende polymorphs have no inversion symmetry (reflection of a crystal relative to any given point does not transform it into itself). This and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of the hexagonal and zincblende ZnO, and pyroelectricity of hexagonal ZnO.

The hexagonal structure has a point group 6 mm (Hermann–Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are &quot;a&quot; = 3.25 Å and &quot;c&quot; = 5.2 Å; their ratio &quot;c/a&quot; ~ 1.60 is close to the ideal value for hexagonal cell &quot;c/a&quot; = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074 nm for Zn2+ and 0.140 nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn−O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.

===Mechanical properties===
ZnO is a wide-band gap semiconductor of the II-VI semiconductor group. The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n-type.

ZnO is a relatively soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale. Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III-V semiconductors, such as GaN. The high heat capacity and heat conductivity, low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics. The E2 optical phonon in ZnO exhibits an unusually long lifetime of 133 ps at 10 K.

Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, it has been stated that ZnO has the highest piezoelectric tensor, or at least one comparable to that of GaN and AlN. This property makes it a technologically important material for many piezoelectrical applications, which require a large electromechanical coupling. Therefore, ZnO in the form of thin film has been one of the most studied and used resonator materials for thin-film bulk acoustic resonators.

===Electrical and optical properties===
Favourable properties of zinc oxide include good transparency, high electron mobility, wide band gap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties make ZnO valuable for a variety of emerging applications: transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and electronics as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.

ZnO has a relatively wide direct band gap of ~3.3 eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a wide band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The band gap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4 eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide. Due to this large band gap, there have been efforts to create visibly transparent solar cells utilising ZnO as a light absorbing layer. However, these solar cells have so far proven highly inefficient.

Most ZnO has &quot;n&quot;-type character, even in the absence of intentional doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.

Reliable p-type doping of ZnO remains difficult. This problem originates from low solubility of p-type dopants and their compensation by abundant n-type impurities. This problem is observed with GaN and ZnSe. Measurement of p-type in &quot;intrinsically&quot; n-type material is complicated by the inhomogeneity of samples.

Current limitations to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; as well as copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type conduction at room temperature.

Electron mobility of ZnO strongly varies with temperature and has a maximum of ~2000 cm2/(V·s) at 80 K. Data on hole mobility are scarce with values in the range 5–30 cm2/(V·s).

ZnO discs, acting as a varistor, are the active material in most surge arresters.

Zinc oxide is noted for its strongly nonlinear optical properties, especially in bulk. The nonlinearity of ZnO nanoparticles can be fine-tuned according to their size.

==Production==

For industrial use, ZnO is produced at levels of 105 tons per year by three main processes:

===Indirect process===
In the indirect or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907 °C (typically around 1000 °C). Zinc vapor reacts with the oxygen in the air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by Edme Jean LeClaire of Paris in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world&#x27;s zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.

===Direct process===
The direct or American process starts with diverse contaminated zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with a source of carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process as compared to the indirect one.

===Wet chemical process===
A small amount of industrial production involves wet chemical processes, which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800 °C.

===Laboratory synthesis===

Numerous specialised methods exist for producing ZnO for scientific studies and niche applications. These methods can be classified by the resulting ZnO form (bulk, thin film, nanowire), temperature (&quot;low&quot;, that is close to room temperature or &quot;high&quot;, that is T ~ 1000 °C), process type (vapor deposition or growth from solution) and other parameters.

Large single crystals (many cubic centimeters) can be grown by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of the high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by a variety of methods including chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, sputtering, spray pyrolysis, thermal oxidation, sol–gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, and pulsed laser deposition.

Zinc oxide can be produced in bulk by precipitation from zinc compounds, mainly zinc acetate, in various solutions, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous ammonium carbonate. Synthetic methods characterized in literature since the year 2000 aim to produce ZnO particles with high surface area and minimal size distribution, including precipitation, mechanochemical, sol-gel, microwave, and emulsion methods.

===ZnO nanostructures===
Nanostructures of ZnO can be synthesized into a variety of morphologies, including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles, etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor–liquid–solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90 °C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).

Aligned ZnO nanowires on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and gallium nitride substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spin coating of ZnO nanoparticles, and the use of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.

==Applications==
The applications of zinc oxide powder are numerous, and the principal ones are summarized below. Most applications exploit the reactivity of the oxide as a precursor to other zinc compounds. For material science applications, zinc oxide has high refractive index, high thermal conductivity, binding, antibacterial and UV-protection properties. Consequently, it is added into materials and products including plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, rubber, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesive, sealants, concrete manufacturing, pigments, foods, batteries, ferrites, and fire retardants.

===Rubber industry===
Between 50% and 60% of ZnO use is in the rubber industry. Zinc oxide along with stearic acid is used in the sulfur vulcanization of rubber. ZnO additives in the form of nanoparticles are used in rubber as a pigment and to enhance its durability, and have been used in composite rubber materials such as those based on montmorillonite to impart germicidal properties.

===Ceramic industry===
Ceramic industry consumes a significant amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefficient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary flux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated influence.

===Medicine===
====Skin treatment====
Zinc oxide as a mixture with about 0.5% iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is called calamine and is used in calamine lotion, a topical skin treatment. Historically, the name calamine was ascribed to a mineral that contained zinc used in powdered form as medicine, but it was determined in 1803 that ore described as calamine was actually a mixture of the zinc minerals smithsonite and hemimorphite.

Zinc oxide is widely used to treat a variety of skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, itching due to eczema, diaper rash and acne. It is used in products such as baby powder and barrier creams to treat diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments. It is often combined with castor oil to form an emollient and astringent, zinc and castor oil cream, commonly used to treat infants.

It is also a component in tape (called &quot;zinc oxide tape&quot;) used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.

====Antibacterial====
Zinc oxide is used in mouthwash products and toothpastes as an anti-bacterial agent proposed to prevent plaque and tartar formation, and to control bad breath by reducing the volatile gases and volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) in the mouth. Along with zinc oxide or zinc salts, these products also commonly contain other active ingredients, such as cetylpyridinium chloride, xylitol, hinokitiol, essential oils and plant extracts.
Powdered zinc oxide has deodorizing and antibacterial properties.

ZnO is added to cotton fabric, rubber, oral care products, and food packaging. Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver. The mechanism of ZnO&#x27;s antibacterial effect has been variously described as the generation of reactive oxygen species, the release of Zn2+ ions, and a general disturbance of the bacterial cell membrane by nanoparticles.

====Sunscreen====
Zinc oxide is used in sunscreen to absorb ultraviolet light. It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (280–320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.

Many sunscreens use nanoparticles of zinc oxide (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore do not appear white. The nanoparticles are not absorbed into the skin more than regular-sized zinc oxide particles are and are only absorbed into the outermost layer of the skin but not into the body.

====Dental restoration====
When mixed with eugenol, zinc oxide eugenol is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in dentistry.

===Food additive===

Zinc oxide is added to many food products, including breakfast cereals, as a source of zinc, a necessary nutrient. Zinc may be added to food in the form of zinc oxide nanoparticles, or as zinc sulfate, zinc gluconate, zinc acetate, or zinc citrate. Some foods also include trace amounts of ZnO even if it is not intended as a nutrient.

===Pigment===
Zinc oxide (zinc white) is used as a pigment in paints and is more opaque than lithopone, but less opaque than titanium dioxide. It is also used in coatings for paper. Chinese white is a special grade of zinc white used in artists&#x27; pigments. The use of zinc white as a pigment in oil painting started in the middle of 18th century. It has partly replaced the poisonous lead white and was used by painters such as Böcklin, Van Gogh, Manet, Munch and others. It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup (CI 77947).

===UV absorber===
Micronized and nano-scale zinc oxide provides strong protection against UVA and UVB ultraviolet radiation, and are consequently used in sunscreens, and also in UV-blocking sunglasses for use in space and for protection when welding, following research by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

===Coatings===
Paints containing zinc oxide powder have long been utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.

ZnO highly n-type doped with aluminium, gallium, or indium is transparent and conductive (transparency ~90%, lowest resistivity ~10−4 Ω·cm). ZnO:Al coatings are used for energy-saving or heat-protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared (IR) radiation back into the room (energy saving) or does not let the IR radiation into the room (heat protection), depending on which side of the window has the coating.

Plastics, such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), can be protected by applying zinc oxide coating. The coating reduces the diffusion of oxygen through PEN. Zinc oxide layers can also be used on polycarbonate in outdoor applications. The coating protects polycarbonate from solar radiation, and decreases its oxidation rate and photo-yellowing.

===Corrosion prevention in nuclear reactors===

Zinc oxide depleted in 64Zn (the zinc isotope with atomic mass 64) is used in corrosion prevention in nuclear pressurized water reactors. The depletion is necessary, because 64Zn is transformed into radioactive 65Zn under irradiation by the reactor neutrons.

===Methane reforming===
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as a pretreatment step to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from natural gas following hydrogenation of any sulfur compounds prior to a methane reformer, which can poison the catalyst. At temperatures between about , H2S is converted to water by the following reaction:
:H2S + ZnO → H2O + ZnS

===Electronics===

ZnO has wide direct band gap (3.37 eV or 375 nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common potential applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Moreover, ultrafast nonlinearities and photoconductive functions have been reported in ZnO. Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar band gap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance, a transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its ability to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. Nanostructured ZnO is an effective medium both in powder and polycrystalline forms in random lasers, due to its high refractive index and aforementioned light emission properties.

===Gas sensors===
Zinc oxide is used in semiconductor gas sensors for detecting airborne compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic compounds. ZnO is a semiconductor that becomes n-doped by adsorption of reducing compounds, which reduces the detected electrical resistance through the device, in a manner similar to the widely used tin oxide semiconductor gas sensors. It is formed into nanostructures such as thin films, nanoparticles, nanopillars, or nanowires to provide a large surface area for interaction with gasses. The sensors are made selective for specific gasses by doping or surface-attaching materials such as catalytic noble metals.

==Aspirational applications==

===Transparent electrodes===
Aluminium-doped ZnO layers are used as transparent electrodes. The components Zn and Al are much cheaper and less toxic compared to the generally used indium tin oxide (ITO). One application which has begun to be commercially available is the use of ZnO as the front contact for solar cells or of liquid crystal displays.

Transparent thin-film transistors (TTFT) can be produced with ZnO. As field-effect transistors, they do not need a p–n junction, thus avoiding the p-type doping problem of ZnO. Some of the field-effect transistors even use ZnO nanorods as conducting channels.

===Piezoelectricity===
The piezoelectricity in textile fibers coated in ZnO have been shown capable of fabricating &quot;self-powered nanosystems&quot; with everyday mechanical stress from wind or body movements.

=== Photocatalysis ===
ZnO, both in macro- and nano- scales, could in principle be used as an electrode in photocatalysis, mainly as an anode in green chemistry applications. As a photocatalyst, ZnO reacts when exposed to UV radiation and is used in photodegradation reactions to remove organic pollutants from the environment. It is also used to replace catalysts used in photochemical reactions that would ordinarily require costly or inconvenient reaction conditions with low yields.

===Other===
The pointed tips of ZnO nanorods could be used as field emitters.

ZnO is a promising anode material for lithium-ion battery because it is cheap, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly. ZnO has a higher theoretical capacity (978 mAh g−1) than many other transition metal oxides such as CoO (715 mAh g−1), NiO (718 mAh g−1) and CuO (674 mAh g−1). ZnO is also used as an electrode in supercapacitors.

==Safety==
As a food additive, zinc oxide is on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s list of generally recognized as safe substances.

Zinc oxide itself is non-toxic; it is hazardous, however, to inhale high concentrations of zinc oxide fumes, such as those generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting alloys containing brass because the melting point of brass is close to the boiling point of zinc. Inhalation of zinc oxide, which may occur when welding galvanized (zinc-plated) steel, can result in a malady called metal fume fever.

In sunscreen formulations that combined zinc oxide with small-molecule UV absorbers, UV light caused photodegradation of the small-molecule asorbers and toxicity in embryonic zebrafish assays.

<text>Dimetrodon ( or ; ) is an extinct genus of sphenacodontid synapsid tetrapods that lived during the Cisuralian age of the Early Permian period, around 295–272 million years ago. With most species measuring long and weighing , the most prominent feature of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is the large neural spine sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending from the vertebrae. It was an obligate quadruped (it could only walk on four legs) and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the Southwestern United States, the majority of these coming from a geological deposit called the Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma. More recently, its fossils have also been found in Germany and over a dozen species have been named since the genus was first erected in 1878.

&quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is often mistaken for a dinosaur or portrayed as a contemporary of dinosaurs in popular culture, but it became extinct by the middle Permian, some 40 million years before the advent of dinosaurs. Although reptile-like in appearance and physiology, &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is much more closely related to mammals, as it belongs to the closest sister family to therapsids, the latter of which contains the direct ancestor of mammals. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is traditionally assigned to the paraphyletic group &quot;pelycosaurs&quot;, a term now considered obsolete and replaced by terms such as &quot;primitive synapsids&quot; or &quot;basal synapsids&quot;; another name &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot; is also used traditionally but incorrectly for non-mammalian synapsids due to some of the features shared with modern mammals such as tooth specialization and endothermy, but that term is now also defunct. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; skull has a single opening (temporal fenestra) behind each eye, a feature shared among all synapsids, unlike the skulls of reptiles and birds, both of which belonging to the clade Sauropsida, which diverged from the synapsids at least since the Late Carboniferous.

&quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was probably one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, due to large species being discovered with small sails and small species being discovered with large sails, essentially ruling out heat regulation as its main purpose. The sail was most likely used in courtship display, including threatening away rivals or showing off to potential mates.
== Description ==

&quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was a quadrupedal, sail-backed synapsid that most likely had a semi-sprawling posture between that of a mammal and a lizard and also could walk in a more upright stance with its body and the majority or all of its tail off the ground. Most &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species ranged in length from and are estimated to have weighed between . The smallest known species &quot;D.  Teutonic&quot; was about long and weighed . The larger species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; were among the largest predators of the Early Permian, although the closely related &quot;Tappenosaurus&quot;, known from skeletal fragments in slightly younger rocks, may have been even larger at an estimated long. Although some &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species could grow very large, many juvenile specimens are known.

=== Skull ===

A single large opening on either side of the back of the skull links &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; to mammals and distinguishes it from most of the earliest sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the nasal cavity and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early four-limbed land-dwelling vertebrates to mammals.

The skull of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is tall and compressed laterally, or side-to-side. The eye sockets are positioned high and far back in the skull. Behind each eye socket is a single hole called an infratemporal fenestra. An additional hole in the skull, the supratemporal fenestra, can be seen when viewed from above. The back of the skull (the occiput) is oriented at a slight upward angle, a feature that it shares with all other early synapsids. The upper margin of the skull slopes downward in a convex arc to the tip of the snout. The tip of the upper jaw, formed by the premaxilla bone, is raised above the part of the jaw formed by the maxilla bone to form a maxillary &quot;step&quot;. Within this step is a diastema, a gap in the tooth row. Its skull was more heavily built than a dinosaur&#x27;s skull.

==== Teeth ====
The size of the teeth varies greatly along the length of the jaws, lending &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; its name, which means &quot;two measures of tooth&quot; in reference to sets of small and large teeth. One or two pairs of caniniforms (large, pointed, canine-like teeth) extend from the maxilla. Large incisor teeth are also present at the tips of the upper and lower jaws, rooted in the premaxillae and dentary bones. Small teeth are present around the maxillary &quot;step&quot; and behind the caniforms, becoming smaller further back in the jaw.

Many teeth are widest at their midsections and narrow closer to the jaws, giving them the appearance of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and other closely related sphenacodontids, which helps to distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of &quot;D. teutonis&quot; lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.

A 2014 study shows that &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was in an arms race against its prey. The smaller species, &quot;D. milleri&quot;, had no tooth serrations because it ate small prey. As prey grew larger, several &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species started developing serrations on their teeth and increasing in size. For instance, &quot;D. limbatus&quot; had enamel serrations that helped it cut through flesh (which were similar to the serrations that can be found on &quot;Secodontosaurus&quot;). The second-largest species, &quot;D. grandis&quot;, has denticle serrations similar to those of sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized for slicing through flesh. As &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;&#x27;s prey grew larger, the various species responded by growing to larger sizes and developing ever-sharper teeth. The thickness and mass of the teeth of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; may also have been an adaptation for increasing dental longevity.

==== Nasal cavity ====
On the inner surface of the nasal section of the skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have supported cartilage that increased the area of the olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.

==== Jaw joint and ear ====
Another transitional feature of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is a ridge in the back of the jaw called the reflected lamina, which is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint, while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.

=== Tail ===

The tail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; makes up a large portion of its total body length and includes around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. The only caudal vertebrae known were the 11 closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries thought that &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; had a very short tail. A largely complete tail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was not described until 1927.

=== Sail ===

The sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is formed by elongated neural spines projecting from the vertebrae. Each spine varies in cross-sectional shape from its base to its tip in what is known as &quot;dimetrodont&quot; differentiation. Near the vertebra body, the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape and, closer to the tip, it takes on a figure-eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine. The figure-eight shape is thought to reinforce the spine, preventing bending and fractures. A cross-section of the spine of one specimen of &quot;Dimetrodon giganhomogenes&quot; is rectangular in shape but preserves figure-eight shaped rings close to its center, indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age. The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip, indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail. The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for the epaxial muscles of the back and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey&#x27;s fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body. Higher up on the distal (outer) portion of the spine, the bone surface is smoother. The periosteum, a layer of tissue surrounding the bone, is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail.

The large groove that runs the length of the spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain vascular canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine&#x27;s cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth that can be used to determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of &quot;D. gigashomogenes&quot;, the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail&#x27;s webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.

=== Skin ===

No fossil evidence of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;&#x27;s skin has yet been found. Impressions of the skin of a related animal, &quot;Estemmenosuchus&quot;, indicate that it would have been smooth and well-provided with glands, but this form of skin may not have applied to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, as its lineage is fairly distant. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; also may have had large scutes on the underside of its tail and belly, as other synapsids had these. Evidence from the varanopid &quot;Ascendonanus&quot; suggests that some early synapsids may have had squamate-like scales. However, some recent studies have put varanopids as taxonomically closer to diapsid reptiles.

== Classification history ==

=== Earliest discoveries ===

The earliest discovery of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; fossils were of a maxilla recovered in 1845 by a man named Donald McLeod, living in the British colony of Prince Edward Island. These fossils were purchased by John William Johnson, a Canadian geologist, and then described by Joseph Leidy in 1854 as the mandible of &quot;Bathygnathus borealis&quot;, a large carnivore related to &quot;Thecodontosaurus,&quot; although it was later reclassified as a species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in 2015, as &quot;Dimetrodon borealis&quot;.

=== First descriptions by Cope ===
Fossils now attributed to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils along with those of many other Permian tetrapods from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope&#x27;s specimens went to the American Museum of Natural History or to the University of Chicago&#x27;s Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field Museum of Natural History).

Sternberg sent some of his own specimens to German paleontologist Ferdinand Broili at Munich University, although Broili was not as prolific as Cope in describing specimens. Cope&#x27;s rival Othniel Charles Marsh also collected some bones of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, which he sent to the Walker Museum. The first use of the name &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; came in 1878 when Cope named the species &quot;Dimetrodon incisivus&quot;, &quot;Dimetrodon rectiformis&quot;, and &quot;Dimetrodon gigas&quot; in the scientific journal &quot;Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society&quot;.

The first description of a &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; fossil came a year earlier, though, when Cope named the species &quot;Clepsydrops limbatus&quot; from the Texas Red Beds. (The name &quot;Clepsydrops&quot; was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either &quot;Clepsydrops&quot; or &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.) &quot;C. limbatus&quot; was reclassified as a species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in 1940, meaning that Cope&#x27;s 1877 paper was the first record of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

Cope was the first to describe a sail-backed synapsid with the naming of &quot;C. natalis&quot; in his 1878 paper, although he called the sail a fin and compared it to the crests of the modern basilisk lizard (&quot;Basilicus&quot;). Sails were not preserved in the specimens of &quot;D.  incisive&quot; and &quot;D. gigas&quot; that Cope described in his 1878 paper, but elongated spines were present in the &quot;D. rectiformis&quot; specimen he described. Cope commented on the purpose of the sail in 1886, writing, &quot;The utility is difficult to imagine. Unless the animal had aquatic habits and swam on its back, the crest or fin must have been in the way of active movements... The limbs are not long enough nor the claws acute enough to demonstrate arboreal habits, as in the existing genus &quot;Basilicus&quot;, where a similar crest exists.&quot;

=== Early 20th century descriptions ===

In the first few decades of the 20th century, American paleontologists E. C. Case authored many studies on &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and described several new species. He received funding from the Carnegie Institution for his study of many &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; specimens in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History and several other museums. Many of these fossils had been collected by Cope but had not been thoroughly described, as Cope was known for erecting new species on the basis of only a few bone fragments.

Beginning in the late 1920s, paleontologist Alfred Romer restudied many &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; specimens and named several new species. In 1940, Romer coauthored a large study with Llewellyn Ivor Price called &quot;Review of the Pelycosauria&quot; in which the species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; named by Cope and Case were reassessed. Most of the species names considered valid by Romer and Price are still used today.

=== New specimens ===
In the decades following Romer and Price&#x27;s monograph, many &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; specimens were described from localities outside Texas and Oklahoma. The first was described from the Four Corners region of Utah in 1966 and another was described from Arizona in 1969. In 1975, Olson reported &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; material from the Washington Formation of Ohio, which has been given a tentative assignment of &quot;D.&quot; cf. &quot;limbatus&quot;. A new species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; called &quot;D. occidentalis&quot; (meaning &quot;western &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;&quot;) was named in 1977 from New Mexico. The specimens found in Utah and Arizona probably also belong to &quot;D. occidentalis&quot;.

Before these discoveries, a theory existed that a midcontinental seaway separated what is now Texas and Oklahoma from more western lands during the Early Permian, isolating &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; to a small region of North America, while a smaller sphenacodontid called &quot;Sphenacodon&quot; dominated the western area. While this seaway probably did exist, the discovery of fossils outside Texas and Oklahoma show that its extent was limited and that it was not an effective barrier to the distribution of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

In 2001, a new species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; called &quot;D. teutonis&quot; was described from the Lower Permian Bromacker locality at the Thuringian Forest of Germany, extending the geographic range of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; outside North America for the first time.

== Species ==
Twenty species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; have been named since the genus was first described in 1878. Many have been synonymized with older named species, and some now belong to different genera.

===Summary===
===&quot;Dimetrodon limbatus&quot;===

&quot;Dimetrodon limbatus&quot; was first described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1877 as &quot;Clepsydrops limbatus&quot;. (The name &quot;Clepsydrops&quot; was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either &quot;Clepsydrops&quot; or &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.) Based on a specimen from the Red Beds of Texas, it was the first known sail-backed synapsid. In 1940, paleontologists Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price reassigned &quot;C. limbatus&quot; to the genus &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, making &quot;D. limbatus&quot; the type species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. Remains tentatively assigned to this species are also known from Washington County, Ohio, which correspond to a relatively large individual. These remains are slightly older than others assigned to &quot;D. limbatus&quot; from the west, although potential &quot;D. limbatus&quot; remains from New Mexico may be concurrent with it.

====&quot;Dimetrodon incisivus&quot;====
The first use of the name &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; came in 1878 when Cope named the species &quot;Dimetrodon incisivus&quot; along with &quot;Dimetrodon rectiformis&quot; and &quot;Dimetrodon gigas&quot;.

====&quot;Dimetrodon rectiformis&quot;====
&quot;Dimetrodon rectiformis&quot; was named alongside &quot;Dimetrodon incisivus&quot; in Cope&#x27;s 1878 paper, and was the only one of the three named species to preserve elongated neural spines. In 1907, paleontologist E. C. Case moved &quot;D. rectiformis&quot; into the species &quot;D. incisivus&quot;. &quot;D. incisivus&quot; was later synonymous with the type species &quot;Dimetrodon limbatus&quot;, making &quot;D. rectiformis&quot; a synonym of &quot;D. limbatus&quot;.

====&quot;Dimetrodon semiradicatus&quot;====
Described in 1881 on the basis of upper jaw bones, &quot;Dimetrodon semiradicatus&quot; was the last species named by Cope. In 1907, E. C. Case synonymized &quot;D. semiradicatus&quot; with &quot;D. incisivus&quot; based on similarities in the shape of the teeth and skull bones. &quot;D. incisivus&quot;&#x27; and &quot;D. semiradicatus&quot; are now considered synonyms of &quot;D. limbatus&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon dollovianus&quot;===
&quot;Dimetrodon dollovianus&quot; was first described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1888 as &quot;Embolophorus dollovianus&quot;. In 1903, E. C. Case published a lengthy description of &quot;E. dollovianus&quot;, which he later referred to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon grandis&quot;===

Paleontologist E. C. Case named a new species of sail-backed synapsid, &quot;Theropleura grandis&quot;, in 1907. In 1940, Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price reassigned &quot;Theropleura grandis&quot; to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, erecting the species &quot;D. grandis&quot;.

====&quot;Dimetrodon gigas&quot;====
In his 1878 paper on fossils from Texas, Cope named &quot;Clepsydrops gigas&quot; along with the first named species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, &quot;D. limbatus&quot;, &quot;D. incisivus&quot;, and &quot;D. rectiformis&quot;. Case reclassified &quot;C. gigas&quot; as a new species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in 1907. Case also described a very well preserved skull of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in 1904, attributing it to the species &quot;Dimetrodon gigas&quot;. In 1919, Charles W. Gilmore attributed a nearly complete specimen of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; to &quot;D. gigas&quot;. &quot;Dimetrodon gigas&quot; is now recognized as a synonym of &quot;D. grandis&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon giganhomogenes&quot;===

&quot;Dimetrodon giganhomogenes&quot; was named by E. C. Case in 1907 and is still considered a valid species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon macrospondylus&quot;===
&quot;Dimetrodon macrospondylus&quot; was first described by Cope in 1884 as &quot;Clepsydrops macrospondylus&quot;. In 1907, Case reclassified it as &quot;Dimetrodon macrospondylus&quot;.

====&quot;Dimetrodon platycentrus&quot;====
&quot;Dimetrodon platycentrus&quot; was first described by Case in his 1907 monograph. It is now considered a synonym of &quot;Dimetrodon macrospondylus&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon natalis&quot;===

Paleontologist Alfred Romer erected the species &quot;Dimetrodon natalis&quot; in 1936, previously described as &quot;Clepsydrops natalis&quot;. &quot;D. natalis&quot; was the smallest known species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; at that time, and was found alongside remains of the larger-bodied &quot;D. limbatus&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon booneorum&quot;===
&quot;Dimetrodon booneorum&quot; was first described by Alfred Romer in 1937 on the basis of remains from Texas.

===&quot;&quot;Dimetrodon&quot; kempae&quot;===
&quot;Dimetrodon kempae&quot; was named by Romer in 1937, in the same paper as &quot;D. booneorum&quot;, &quot;D. loomisi&quot;, and &quot;D. milleri&quot;. &quot;Dimetrodon kempae&quot; was named on the basis of a single humerus and a few vertebrae, and may therefore be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; that cannot be distinguished as a unique species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. In 1940, Romer and Price raised the possibility that &quot;D. kempae&quot; may not fall within the genus &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, preferring to classify it as Sphenacodontidae &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon loomisi&quot;===

&quot;Dimetrodon loomisi&quot; was first described by Alfred Romer in 1937 along with &quot;D. booneorum&quot;, &quot;D. kempae&quot;, and &quot;D. milleri&quot;. Remains have been found in Texas and Oklahoma.

===&quot;Dimetrodon milleri&quot;===

&quot;Dimetrodon milleri&quot; was described by Romer in 1937. It is one of the smallest species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in North America and may be closely related to &quot;D. occidentalis&quot;, another small-bodied species. &quot;D. milleri&quot; is known from two skeletons, one nearly complete (MCZ 1365) and another less complete but larger (MCZ 1367). &quot;D. milleri&quot; is the oldest known species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

Besides its small size, &quot;D. milleri&quot; differs from other species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in that its neural spines are circular rather than figure-eight shaped in cross-section. Its vertebrae are also shorter in height relative to the rest of the skeleton than those of other &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species. The skull is tall and the snout is short relative to the temporal region. A short vertebrae and tall skull are also seen in the species &quot;D. booneorum&quot;, &quot;D. limbatus&quot; and &quot;D. grandis&quot;, suggesting that &quot;D. milleri&quot; may be the first of an evolutionary progression between these species.

===&quot;Dimetrodon angelensis&quot;===

&quot;Dimetrodon angelensis&quot; was named by paleontologist Everett C. Olson in 1962. Specimens of the species were reported from the San Angelo Formation of Texas. It is also the largest species of Dimetrodon.

===&quot;Dimetrodon occidentalis&quot;===
&quot;Dimetrodon occidentalis&quot; was named in 1977 from New Mexico. Its name means &quot;western &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;&quot; because it is the only North American species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; known west of Texas and Oklahoma. It was named on the basis of a single skeleton belonging to a relatively small individual. The small size of &quot;D. occidentalis&quot; is similar to that of &quot;D. milleri&quot;, suggesting a close relationship. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; specimens found in Utah and Arizona probably also belong to &quot;D. occidentalis&quot;.

===&quot;Dimetrodon teutonis&quot;===
&quot;Dimetrodon teutonis&quot; was named in 2001 from the Thuringian Forest of Germany and was the first species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; to be described outside North America. It is also the smallest species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

===Species assigned to different genera===

====&quot;Dimetrodon cruciger&quot;====
In 1878, Cope published a paper called &quot;The Theromorphous Reptilia&quot; in which he described &quot;Dimetrodon cruciger&quot;. &quot;D. cruciger&quot; was distinguished by the small projections that extended from either side of each neural spine like the branches of a tree. In 1886, Cope moved &quot;D. cruciger&quot; to the genus &quot;Naosaurus&quot; because he considered its spines so different from those of other &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species that the species deserved its own genus. &quot;Naosaurus&quot; would later be synonymized with &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot;, a genus which Cope named in 1882 on the basis of skulls that evidently belonged to herbivorous animals given their blunt crushing teeth.

====&quot;Dimetrodon longiramus&quot;====
E. C. Case named the species &quot;Dimetrodon longiramus&quot; in 1907 on the basis of a scapula and elongated mandible from the Belle Plains Formation of Texas. In 1940, Romer and Price recognized that the &quot;D. longiramus&quot; material belonged to the same taxon as another specimen described by paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in 1916, which included a similarly elongated mandible and a long maxilla. Williston did not consider his specimen to belong to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; but instead classified it as an ophiacodontid. Romer and Price assigned Case and Williston&#x27;s specimens to a newly erected genus and species, &quot;Secodontosaurus longiramus&quot;, that was closely related to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

== Phylogenetic classification ==

&quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is an early member of a group called synapsids, which include mammals and many of their extinct relatives, though it is not an ancestor of any mammal (which appeared millions of years later). It is often mistaken for a dinosaur in popular culture, despite having become extinct some 40 million years (Ma) before the first appearance of dinosaurs in the Triassic period. As a synapsid, &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is more closely related to mammals than to dinosaurs or any living reptile. By the early 1900s most paleontologists called &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; a reptile in accordance with Linnean taxonomy, which ranked Reptilia as a class and &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; as a genus within that class. Mammals were assigned to a separate class, and &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was described as a &quot;mammal-like reptile&quot;. Paleontologists theorized that mammals evolved from this group in (what they called) a reptile-to-mammal transition.

=== Phylogenetic taxonomy of Synapsida ===

Under phylogenetic systematics, the descendants of the last common ancestor of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and all living reptiles would include all mammals because &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is more closely related to mammals than to any living reptile. Thus, if it is desired to avoid the clade that contains both mammals and the living reptiles, then &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; must not be included in that clade—nor any other &quot;mammal-like reptile&quot;. Descendants of the last common ancestor of mammals and reptiles (which appeared around 310 Ma in the Late Carboniferous) are therefore split into two clades: Synapsida, which includes &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and mammals, and Sauropsida, which includes living reptiles and all extinct reptiles more closely related to them than to mammals.

Within clade Synapsida, &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is part of the clade Sphenacodontia, which was first proposed as an early synapsid group in 1940 by paleontologists Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price, along with the groups Ophiacodontia and Edaphosauria. All three groups are known from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian. Romer and Price distinguished them primarily by postcranial features such as the shapes of limbs and vertebrae. Ophiacodontia was considered the most primitive group because its members appeared the most reptilian, and Sphenacodontia was the most advanced because its members appeared the most like a group called Therapsida, which included the closest relatives to mammals. Romer and Price placed another group of early synapsids called varanopids within Sphenacodontia, considering them to be more primitive than other sphenacodonts like &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. They thought varanopids and &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;-like sphenacodonts were closely related because both groups were carnivorous, although varanopids are much smaller and more lizard-like, lacking sails.

The modern view of synapsid relationships was proposed by paleontologist Robert R. Reisz in 1986, whose study included features mostly found in the skull rather than in the postcranial skeleton. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is still considered a sphenacodont under this phylogeny, but varanodontids are now considered more basal synapsids, falling outside clade Sphenacodontia. Within Sphenacodontia is the group Sphenacodontoidea, which in turn contains Sphenacodontidae and Therapsida. Sphenacodontidae is the group containing &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and several other sail-backed synapsids like &quot;Sphenacodon&quot; and &quot;Secodontosaurus&quot;, while Therapsida includes mammals and their mostly Permian and Triassic relatives.

Below is the cladogram Clade Synapsida, which follows this phylogeny of Synapsida as modified from the analysis of Benson (2012).
The below cladogram shows the relationships of a few &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; species, from Brink &quot;et al.&quot;, (2015).

== Paleobiology ==

=== Function of neural spines ===

Paleontologists have proposed many ways in which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.

==== Thermoregulation ====
In 1940, Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price proposed that the sail served a thermoregulatory function, allowing individuals to warm their bodies with the Sun. In the following years, many models were created to estimate the effectiveness of thermoregulation in &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. For example, in a 1973 article in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, paleontologists C. D. Bramwell and P. B. Fellgett estimated that it took a individual about one and a half hours for its body temperature to rise from . In 1986, Steven C. Haack concluded that the warming was slower than previously thought and that the process probably took four hours. Using a model based on a variety of environmental factors and hypothesized physiological aspects of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, Haack found that the sail allowed &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; to warm faster in the morning and reach a slightly higher body temperature during the day, but that it was ineffective in releasing excess heat and did not allow &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; to retain a higher body temperature at night. In 1999, a group of mechanical engineers created a computer model to analyze the ability of the sail to regulate body temperature during different seasons, and concluded that the sail was beneficial for capturing and releasing heat at all times in the year.

Most of these studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;: one as a means of warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body temperature becomes high. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail&#x27;s large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.

In 1986, J. Scott Turner and C. Richard Tracy proposed that the evolution of a sail in &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat in a manner similar to that of the sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. The homeothermy that developed in animals like &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.

Recent studies on the sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and other sphenacodontids support Haack&#x27;s 1986 contention that the sail was poorly adapted to releasing heat and maintaining a stable body temperature. The presence of sails in small-bodied species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; such as &quot;D. milleri&quot; and &quot;D. teutonis&quot; does not fit the idea that the sail&#x27;s purpose was thermoregulation because smaller sails are less able to transfer heat and because small bodies can absorb and release heat easily on their own. Moreover, close relatives of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; such as &quot;Sphenacodon&quot; have very low crests that would have been useless as thermoregulatory devices. The large sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; is thought to have developed gradually from these smaller crests, meaning that over most of the sail&#x27;s evolutionary history, thermoregulation could not have served an important function.

Although the function of its sail remains uncertain, &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and other Sphenacodontids were likely to have been whole-body endotherms, characterised by a high energy metabolism (tachymetabolism) and probably a capacity for maintaining a high and stable body temperature. This conclusion was part of an amniote-wide study that found tachymetabolic endothermy to have been widespread throughout, and likely plesiomorphic to both synapsids and sauropsids. For &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; the evidence was the endothermy-indicative size of the foramina through which blood was delivered to their long bones and the high blood pressure that would have been necessary to provide blood to the tops of the well-vascularised spines supporting the sail.

Larger bodied specimens of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; have larger sails relative to their size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate a great deal of heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.

==== Sexual selection ====
The allometric exponent for sail height is similar in magnitude to the scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed in the context of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of &quot;D. limbatus&quot; (Romer and Price 1940).

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
&quot;Dimetrodon&quot; may have been sexually dimorphic, meaning that males and females had slightly different body sizes. Some specimens of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; have been hypothesized as males because they have thicker bones, larger sails, longer skulls, and more pronounced maxillary &quot;steps&quot; than others. Based on these differences, the mounted skeletons in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 4636) and the Field Museum of Natural History may be males and the skeletons in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science (MCZ 1347) and the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History may be females.
== Paleoecology ==

Fossils of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; are known from the United States (Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Ohio), Canada (Prince Edward Island) and Germany, areas that were part of the supercontinent Euramerica during the Early Permian. Within the United States, almost all material attributed to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; has come from three geological groups in north-central Texas and south-central Oklahoma: the Clear Fork Group, the Wichita Group, and the Pease River Group. Most fossil finds are part of lowland ecosystems which, during the Permian, would have been vast wetlands. In particular, the Red Beds of Texas is an area of great diversity of fossil tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates. In addition to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, the most common tetrapods in the Red Beds and throughout Early Permian deposits in the southwestern United States, are the amphibians &quot;Archeria&quot;, &quot;Diplocaulus&quot;, &quot;Eryops&quot;, and &quot;Trimerorhachis&quot;, the reptiliomorph &quot;Seymouria&quot;, the reptile &quot;Captorhinus&quot;, and the synapsids &quot;Ophiacodon&quot; and &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot;. These tetrapods made up a group of animals that paleontologist Everett C. Olson called the &quot;Permo-Carboniferous chronofauna&quot;, a fauna that dominated the continental Euramerican ecosystem for several million years. Based on the geology of deposits like the Red Beds, the fauna is thought to have inhabited a well-vegetated lowland deltaic ecosystem.

=== Food web ===

Olson made many inferences on the paleoecology of the Texas Red beds and the role of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; within its ecosystem. He proposed several main types of ecosystems in which the earliest tetrapods lived. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; belonged to the most primitive ecosystem, which developed from aquatic food webs. In it, aquatic plants were the primary producers and were largely fed upon by fish and aquatic invertebrates. Most land vertebrates fed on these aquatic primary consumers. &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; was probably the top predator of the Red Beds ecosystem, feeding on a variety of organisms such as the shark &quot;Xenacanthus&quot;, the aquatic amphibians &quot;Trimerorhachis&quot; and &quot;Diplocaulus&quot;, and the terrestrial tetrapods &quot;Seymouria&quot; and &quot;Trematops&quot;. Insects are known from the Early Permian Red Beds and were probably involved to some degree in the same food web as &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, feeding small reptiles like &quot;Captorhinus&quot;. The Red Beds assemblage also included some of the first large land-living herbivores like &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot; and &quot;Diadectes&quot;. Feeding primarily on terrestrial plants, these herbivores did not derive their energy from aquatic food webs. According to Olson, the best modern analogue for the ecosystem &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; inhabited is the Everglades. The exact lifestyle of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; (amphibious to terrestrial) has long been controversial, but bone microanatomy supports a terrestrial lifestyle, which implies that it would have fed mostly on land, on the banks, or in very shallow water. Evidence also exists for &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; preying on aestivating &quot;Diplocaulus&quot; during times of drought, with three partially eaten juvenile &quot;Diplocaulus&quot; in a burrow of eight bearing teeth marks from a &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; that unearthed and killed them.

The only species of &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; found outside the southwestern United States is &quot;D. teutonis&quot; from Germany. Its remains were found in the Tambach Formation in a fossil site called the Bromacker locality. The Bromacker&#x27;s assemblage of Early Permian tetrapods is unusual in that there are few large-bodied synapsids serving the role of top predators. &quot;D. teutonis&quot; is estimated to have been only in length, too small to prey on the large diadectid herbivores that are abundant in the Bromacker assemblage. It more likely ate small vertebrates and insects. Only three fossils can be attributed to large predators, and they are thought to have been either large varanopids or small sphenacodonts, both of which could potentially prey on &quot;D. teutonis&quot;. In contrast to the lowland deltaic Red Beds of Texas, the Bromacker deposits are thought to have represented an upland environment with no aquatic species. It is possible that large-bodied carnivores were not part of the Bromacker assemblage because they were dependent on large aquatic amphibians for food.

<doc id="515346" wikidata="Q3993049" url="?curid=515346" title="Tongue-in-cheek">
<text>Tongue-in-cheek is an idiom that describes a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning. Early users of the phrase include Sir Walter Scott in his 1828 &quot;The Fair Maid of Perth&quot;.

The physical act of putting one&#x27;s tongue into one&#x27;s cheek once signified contempt. For example, in Tobias Smollett&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Roderick Random,&quot; which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to Bath and on the way apprehends a highwayman. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
The phrase appears in 1828 in &quot;The Fair Maid of Perth&quot; by Sir Walter Scott: 
It is not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase. The more modern ironic sense appeared in a poem in &quot;The Ingoldsby Legends&quot; (1842) by the English clergyman Richard Barham, in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth—biting one&#x27;s tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.

<doc id="515358" wikidata="Q319520" url="?curid=515358" title="Pelycosaur">
<text>Pelycosaur ( ) is an older term for basal or primitive Late Paleozoic synapsids, excluding the therapsids and their descendants. Previously, the term mammal-like reptile had been used, and pelycosaur was considered an order, but this is now thought to be incorrect and outdated.

Because it excludes the advanced synapsid group Therapsida, the term is paraphyletic and contrary to modern formal naming practice. Thus the name &quot;pelycosaurs&quot;, similar to the term &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot;, had fallen out of favor among scientists by the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature. The terms stem mammals, protomammals, and basal or primitive synapsids are instead used where needed.

==Etymology==
The modern word was created from Greek meaning &#x27;basin&#x27; and meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;. The term &quot;pelycosaur&quot; has been fairly well abandoned by paleontologists because it no longer matches the features that distinguish a clade.

Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic taxon because it excludes the therapsids. For that reason, the term is sometimes avoided by proponents of a strict cladistic approach. Eupelycosauria is used to designate the clade that includes most pelycosaurs, along with the Therapsida and Mammalia. In contrast to &quot;pelycosaurs&quot;, Eupelycosauria is a proper monophyletic group. Caseasauria is a pelycosaur side-branch, or clade, that did not leave any descendants.

==Evolutionary history==
The pelycosaurs appear to have been a group of synapsids that have direct ancestral links with the mammals, having differentiated teeth and a developing hard palate. The pelycosaurs appeared during the Late Carboniferous and reached their apex in the early part of the Permian, remaining the dominant land animals for some 40 million years. A few continued into the Capitanian, but they experienced a sharp decline in diversity in the late Kungurian. They were succeeded by the therapsids.

==Description==

Some species were quite large, growing to a length of or more, although most species were much smaller. Well-known pelycosaurs include the genera &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, &quot;Sphenacodon&quot;, &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Ophiacodon&quot;.

Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America, although some small, late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa.

Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles, pelycosaurs might have lacked reptilian epidermal scales. Fossil evidence from some varanopids shows that parts of the skin were covered in rows of osteoderms, presumably overlain by horny scutes. The belly was covered in rectangular scutes, looking like those present in crocodiles. Parts of the skin &quot;not&quot; covered in scutes might have had naked, glandular skin like that found in some mammals. Dermal scutes are also found in a diverse number of extant mammals with conservative body types, such as in the tails of some rodents, sengis, moonrats, the opossums, and other marsupials, and as regular dermal armour with underlying bone in the armadillo.

At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail, consisting of elongated vertebral spines: the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids. In life, this may have been covered by skin, and likely functioned as a thermoregulatory device or as a mating display.

==Taxonomy==
In phylogenetic nomenclature, &quot;Pelycosauria&quot; is not used formally, since it does not constitute a group of &quot;all&quot; organisms descended from some common ancestor (a clade), because the group specifically excludes the therapsids which are descended from pelycosaurs. Instead, it represents a paraphyletic &quot;grade&quot; of basal synapsids leading up to the clade Therapsida.

In 1940, the group was reviewed in detail, and every species known at the time described, with many illustrated, in an important monograph by Alfred Sherwood Romer and Llewellyn Price.

In traditional classification, the order Pelycosauria is paraphyletic in that the therapsids (the &quot;higher&quot; synapsids) have emerged from them. That means Pelycosauria is a grouping of animals that does not contain all descendants of its common ancestor, as is often required by phylogenetic nomenclature. In evolutionary taxonomy, Therapsida is a separated order from Pelycosauria, and mammals (having evolved from therapsids) are separated from both as their own class. This use has not been recommended by a majority of systematists since the 1990s, but several paleontologists nevertheless continue using this word.

The following classification was presented by Benton in 2004.

* Order Pelycosauria*

<text>Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern instruction set architectures and operating systems. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself. Protection may encompass all accesses to a specified area of memory, write accesses, or attempts to execute the contents of the area. An attempt to access unauthorized memory results in a hardware fault, e.g., a segmentation fault, storage violation exception, generally causing abnormal termination of the offending process. Memory protection for computer security includes additional techniques such as address space layout randomization and executable-space protection.

== Methods ==

=== Segmentation ===

Segmentation refers to dividing a computer&#x27;s memory into segments. A reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset within that segment. A segment descriptor may limit access rights, e.g., read only, only from certain rings.

The x86 architecture has multiple segmentation features, which are helpful for using protected memory on this architecture. On the x86 architecture, the Global Descriptor Table and Local Descriptor Tables can be used to reference segments in the computer&#x27;s memory. Pointers to memory segments on x86 processors can also be stored in the processor&#x27;s segment registers. Initially x86 processors had 4 segment registers, CS (code segment), SS (stack segment), DS (data segment) and ES (extra segment); later another two segment registers were added – FS and GS.

=== Paged virtual memory ===
In paging the memory address space or segment is divided into equal-sized blocks called pages. Using virtual memory hardware, each page can reside in any location at a suitable boundary of the computer&#x27;s physical memory, or be flagged as being protected. Virtual memory makes it possible to have a linear virtual memory address space and to use it to access blocks fragmented over physical memory address space.

Most computer architectures which support paging also use pages as the basis for memory protection.

A &quot;page table&quot; maps virtual memory to physical memory. There may be a single page table, a page table for each process, a page table for each segment, or a hierarchy of page tables, depending on the architecture and the OS. The page tables are usually invisible to the process. Page tables make it easier to allocate additional memory, as each new page can be allocated from anywhere in physical memory. On some systems a page table entry can also designate a page as read-only.

Some operating systems set up a different address space for each process, which provides hard memory protection boundaries.
It is impossible for an unprivileged application to access a page that has not been explicitly allocated to it, because every memory address either points to a page allocated to that application, or generates an interrupt called a &quot;page fault&quot;. Unallocated pages, and pages allocated to any other application, do not have any addresses from the application point of view.

A page fault may not necessarily indicate an error. Page faults are not only used for memory protection. The operating system may manage the page table in such a way that a reference to a page that has been previously paged out to secondary storage causes a page fault. The operating system intercepts the page fault, loads the required memory page, and the application continues as if no fault had occurred. This scheme, a type of virtual memory, allows in-memory data not currently in use to be moved to secondary storage and back in a way which is transparent to applications, to increase overall memory capacity.

On some systems, a request for virtual storage may allocate a block of virtual addresses for which no page frames have been assigned, and the system will only assign and initialize page frames when page faults occur. On some systems a guard page may be used, either for error detection or to automatically grow data structures.

On some systems, the page fault mechanism is also used for executable space protection such as W^X.

=== Protection keys ===
A memory protection key (MPK) mechanism divides physical memory into blocks of a particular size (e.g., 4 KiB), each of which has an associated numerical value called a protection key. Each process also has a protection key value associated with it. On a memory access the hardware checks that the current process&#x27;s protection key matches the value associated with the memory block being accessed; if not, an exception occurs. This mechanism was introduced in the System/360 architecture. It is available on today&#x27;s System z mainframes and heavily used by System z operating systems and their subsystems.

The System/360 protection keys described above are associated with physical addresses. This is different from the protection key mechanism used by architectures such as the Hewlett-Packard/Intel IA-64 and Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC, which are associated with virtual addresses, and which allow multiple keys per process.

In the Itanium and PA-RISC architectures, translations (TLB entries) have &quot;keys&quot; (Itanium) or &quot;access ids&quot; (PA-RISC) associated with them. A running process has several protection key registers (16 for Itanium, 4 for PA-RISC). A translation selected by the virtual address has its key compared to each of the protection key registers. If any of them match (plus other possible checks), the access is permitted. If none match, a fault or exception is generated. The software fault handler can, if desired, check the missing key against a larger list of keys maintained by software; thus, the protection key registers inside the processor may be treated as a software-managed cache of a larger list of keys associated with a process.

PA-RISC has 15–18 bits of key; Itanium mandates at least 18. Keys are usually associated with &quot;protection domains&quot;, such as libraries, modules, etc.

In the x86, the protection keys architecture allows tagging virtual addresses for user pages with any of 16 protection keys. All the pages tagged with the same protection key constitute a protection domain. A new register contains the permissions associated with each of the protection domain. Load and store operations are checked against both the page table permissions and the protection key permissions associated with the protection domain of the virtual address, and only allowed if both permissions allow the access. The protection key permissions can be set from user space, allowing applications to directly restrict access to the application data without OS intervention. Since the protection keys are associated with a virtual address, the protection domains are per address space, so processes running in different address spaces can each use all 16 domains.

=== Protection rings ===
In Multics and systems derived from it, each segment has a protection ring for reading, writing and execution; an attempt by a process with a higher ring number than the ring number for the segment causes a fault. There is a mechanism for safely calling procedures that run in a lower ring and returning to the higher ring. There are mechanisms for a routine running with a low ring number to access a parameter with the larger of its own ring and the caller&#x27;s ring.

=== Simulated segmentation ===
Simulation is the use of a monitoring program to interpret the machine code instructions of some computer architectures. Such an instruction set simulator can provide memory protection by using a segmentation-like scheme and validating the target address and length of each instruction in real time before actually executing them. The simulator must calculate the target address and length and compare this against a list of valid address ranges that it holds concerning the thread&#x27;s environment, such as any dynamic memory blocks acquired since the thread&#x27;s inception, plus any valid shared static memory slots. The meaning of &quot;valid&quot; may change throughout the thread&#x27;s life depending upon context. It may sometimes be allowed to alter a static block of storage, and sometimes not, depending upon the current mode of execution, which may or may not depend on a storage key or supervisor state.

It is generally not advisable to use this method of memory protection where adequate facilities exist on a CPU, as this takes valuable processing power from the computer. However, it is generally used for debugging and testing purposes to provide an extra fine level of granularity to otherwise generic storage violations and can indicate precisely which instruction is attempting to overwrite the particular section of storage which may have the same storage key as unprotected storage.

=== Capability-based addressing ===

Capability-based addressing is a method of memory protection that is unused in modern commercial computers. In this method, pointers are replaced by protected objects (called &quot;capabilities&quot;) that can only be created using privileged instructions which may only be executed by the kernel, or some other process authorized to do so. This effectively lets the kernel control which processes may access which objects in memory, with no need to use separate address spaces or context switches. Only a few commercial products used capability based security: Plessey System 250, IBM System/38, Intel iAPX 432 architecture and KeyKOS. Capability approaches are widely used in research systems such as EROS and Combex DARPA browser. They are used conceptually as the basis for some virtual machines, most notably Smalltalk and Java. Currently, the DARPA-funded CHERI project at University of Cambridge is working to create a modern capability machine that also supports legacy software.

=== Dynamic tainting ===
Dynamic tainting is a technique for protecting programs from illegal memory accesses. When memory is allocated, at runtime, this technique taints both the memory and the corresponding pointer using the same taint mark. Taint marks are then suitably propagated while the program executes and are checked every time a memory address &quot;m&quot; is accessed through a pointer &quot;p&quot;; if the taint marks associated with &quot;m&quot; and &quot;p&quot; differ, the execution is stopped and the illegal access is reported.

SPARC M7 processors (and higher) implement dynamic tainting in hardware. Oracle markets this feature as Silicon Secured Memory (SSM) (previously branded as Application Data Integrity (ADI)).

The lowRISC CPU design includes dynamic tainting under the name Tagged Memory.

== Measures ==
The protection level of a particular implementation may be measured by how closely it adheres to the principle of minimum privilege.

== Memory protection in different operating systems ==
Different operating systems use different forms of memory protection or separation. Although memory protection was common on most mainframes and many minicomputer systems from the 1960s, true memory separation was not used in home computer operating systems until OS/2 (and in RISC OS) was released in 1987. On prior systems, such lack of protection was even used as a form of interprocess communication, by sending a pointer between processes. It is possible for processes to access System Memory in the Windows 9x family of operating systems.

Some operating systems that do implement memory protection include:

* Unix-like systems (since the late 1970s), including Solaris, Linux, BSD, macOS, iOS and GNU Hurd
* Plan9 and Inferno, created at Bell Labs as Unix successors (1992, 1995)
* OS/2 (1987)
* RISC OS (1987) (The OS memory protection is not comprehensive.)
* Microware OS-9, as an optional module (since 1992)
* Microsoft Windows family from Windows NT 3.1 (1993)
* Atari MultiTOS (since 1991)
* Pharos (since 2017)

On Unix-like systems, the codice_1 system call is used to control memory protection.

<doc id="515380" wikidata="Q585285" url="?curid=515380" title="Thrombocytopenia">
<text>In hematology, thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets (also known as thrombocytes) in the blood. Low levels of platelets in turn may lead to prolonged or excessive bleeding. It is the most common coagulation disorder among intensive care patients and is seen in a fifth of medical patients and a third of surgical patients.

A normal human platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets/microliter (μL) of blood. Values outside this range do not necessarily indicate disease. One common definition of thrombocytopenia requiring emergency treatment is a platelet count below 50,000/μL. Thrombocytopenia can be contrasted with the conditions associated with an abnormally &quot;high&quot; level of platelets in the blood – thrombocythemia (when the cause is unknown), and thrombocytosis (when the cause is known).

==Signs and symptoms==
Thrombocytopenia usually has no symptoms and is picked up on a routine complete blood count. Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding, such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums. Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. Bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms and petechiae in the feet, legs, and mucous membranes, may be caused by spontaneous bleeding under the skin.

Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not secondary to another disorder. Ensuring that the other blood cell types, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, are not also suppressed, is also important.
Painless, round, and pinpoint (1 to 3 mm in diameter) petechiae usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form ecchymoses. Larger than petechiae, ecchymoses are purple, blue, or yellow-green areas of skin that vary in size and shape. They can occur anywhere on the body.

A person with this disease may also complain of malaise, fatigue, and general weakness (with or without accompanying blood loss). Acquired thrombocytopenia may be associated with the use of certain drugs. Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding (petechiae or ecchymoses), along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled bullae in the mouth. If the person&#x27;s platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/μL, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/μL, spontaneous bruising will be seen (mostly on the arms and legs).

==Causes==

Thrombocytopenia can be inherited or acquired.

===Decreased production===
Abnormally low platelet production may be caused by:
* Dehydration, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency
* Leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or aplastic anemia
* Decreased production of thrombopoietin by the liver in liver failure
* Sepsis, systemic viral or bacterial infection
* Leptospirosis
* Hereditary syndromes

===Increased destruction===

Abnormally high rates of platelet destruction may be due to immune or nonimmune conditions, including:
* Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
* Hemolytic–uremic syndrome
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation
* Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
* Antiphospholipid syndrome
* Systemic lupus erythematosus
* Post-transfusion purpura
* Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
* Hypersplenism
* Dengue fever
* Gaucher&#x27;s disease
* Zika virus

===Medication-induced===

These medications can induce thrombocytopenia through direct myelosuppression:
* Valproic acid
* Methotrexate
* Carboplatin
* Interferon
* Isotretinoin
* Panobinostat
* H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors

===Other causes===
* Laboratory error, possibly due to the anticoagulant EDTA in CBC specimen tubes; a &quot;citrated&quot; platelet count is a useful follow-up study
* Snakebite
* Lyme disease
* Thrombocytapheresis (also called plateletpheresis)
* Niemann–Pick disease

==Diagnosis==

Laboratory tests for thrombocytopenia might include full blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, vitamin B12 levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral blood smear. If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, a bone marrow biopsy is usually recommended to differentiate cases of decreased platelet production from cases of peripheral platelet destruction.

Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized alcoholics may be caused by spleen enlargement, folate deficiency, and most frequently, the direct toxic effect of alcohol on production, survival time, and function of platelets. Platelet count begins to rise after 2 to 5 days&#x27; abstinence from alcohol. The condition is generally benign, and clinically significant hemorrhage is rare.

In severe thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow study can determine the number, size, and maturity of the megakaryocytes. This information may identify ineffective platelet production as the cause of thrombocytopenia and rule out a malignant disease process at the same time.

==Treatment==

Treatment is guided by the severity and specific cause of the disease. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing drugs suspected to cause it or treating underlying sepsis. Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a hematologist. Corticosteroids may be used to increase platelet production. Lithium carbonate or folate may also be used to stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow.

=== Platelet transfusions ===
Platelet transfusions may be suggested for people who have a low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia.

===Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura===
Treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a medical emergency, since the associated hemolytic anemia and platelet activation can lead to kidney failure and changes in the level of consciousness. Treatment of TTP was revolutionized in the 1980s with the application of plasmapheresis. According to the Furlan–Tsai hypothesis, this treatment works by removing antibodies against the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS-13. The plasmapheresis procedure also adds active ADAMTS-13 protease proteins to the patient, restoring a normal level of von Willebrand factor multimers. Patients with persistent antibodies against ADAMTS-13 do not always manifest TTP, and these antibodies alone are not sufficient to explain how plasmapheresis treats TTP.

===Immune thrombocytopenic purpura===
Many cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, can be left untreated, and spontaneous remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts under 50,000/μL are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts under 10,000/μL are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with such low platelet counts. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; hematologists recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000/μL, although exceptions to this observation have been documented.

Thrombopoetin analogues have been tested extensively for the treatment of ITP. These agents had previously shown promise, but had been found to stimulate antibodies against endogenous thrombopoietin or lead to thrombosis. Romiplostim (trade name Nplate, formerly AMG 531) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients, especially those who relapsed following splenectomy.

===Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia===

Discontinuation of heparin is critical in a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Beyond that, however, clinicians generally treat to avoid thrombosis. Treatment may include a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as lepirudin or argatroban. Other &quot;blood thinners&quot; sometimes used in this setting include bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Platelet transfusions are not routinely used to treat HIT because thrombosis, not bleeding, is the primary problem. Warfarin is not recommended until platelets have normalized.

===Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia===
Bone marrow/stem cell transplants are the only known cures for this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death before the transplant can be performed, although this is not always the case.

=== Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived platelets ===
Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived platelets is a technology currently being researched by the private sector, in association with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, that would create platelets outside the human body.

==Neonatal thrombocytopenia==
Thrombocytopenia affects a few newborns, and its prevalence in neonatal intensive care units is high. Normally, it is mild and resolves without consequences. Most cases affect preterm birth infants and result from placental insufficiency and/or fetal hypoxia. Other causes, such as alloimmunity, genetics, autoimmunity, and infection, are less frequent.

Thrombocytopenia that starts after the first 72 hours, since birth is often the result of underlying sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis. In the case of infection, polymerase chain reaction tests may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic-resistance genes. Possible pathogens include viruses (e.g. cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, HIV), bacteria (e.g. &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Enterococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;), fungi (e.g. &quot;Candida&quot; spp.), and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. The severity of thrombocytopenia may be correlated with pathogen type; some research indicates that the most severe cases are related to fungal or Gram-negative bacterial infection. The pathogen may be transmitted during or before birth, by breast feeding, or during transfusion. Interleukin-11 is being investigated as a drug for managing thrombocytopenia, especially in cases of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis.

<doc id="515382" wikidata="Q3300772" url="?curid=515382" title="Beamline">
<text>In accelerator physics, a beamline refers to the trajectory of the beam of particles, including the overall construction of the path segment (guide tubes, diagnostic devices) along a specific path of an accelerator facility. This part is either
* the line in a linear accelerator along which a beam of particles travels, or
* the path leading from particle generator (e.g. a cyclic accelerator, synchrotron light sources, cyclotrons, or spallation sources) to the experimental end-station.

Beamlines usually end in experimental stations that utilize particle beams or synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron, or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor. Beamlines are used in experiments in particle physics, materials science, life science, chemistry, and molecular biology, but can also be used for irradiation tests or to produce isotopes.

==Beamline in a particle accelerator==

In particle accelerators the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a concrete housing for shielding purposes. The beamline is usually a cylindrical metal pipe, typically called a &quot;beam pipe&quot;, and/or a &quot;drift tube&quot;, evacuated to a high vacuum so there are few gas molecules in the path for the beam of accelerated particles to hit, which otherwise could scatter them before they reach their destination.

There are specialized devices and equipment on the beamline that are used for producing, maintaining, monitoring, and accelerating the particle beam. These devices may be in proximity of or attached directly to the beamline. These devices include sophisticated transducers, diagnostics (position monitors and wire scanners), lenses, collimators, thermocouples, ion pumps, ion gauges, ion chambers (for diagnostic purposes; usually called &quot;beam monitors&quot;), vacuum valves (&quot;isolation valves&quot;), and gate valves, to mention a few.

It is imperative to have all beamline sections, magnets, etc., aligned (often by a survey and an alignment crew by using a laser tracker), beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation.

==Synchrotron radiation beamline==
Regarding synchrotrons, &quot;beamline&quot; may also refer to the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron radiation facility. A typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography, although many other techniques utilising synchrotron light exist.

At a large synchrotron facility there will be many beamlines, each optimised for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station. A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron facility will be 25 to 100 m long from the storage ring to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines opening on day one of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.

The beamline elements are located in radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. Entrance to the hutches is forbidden when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. This is enforced by the use of elaborate safety systems with redundant interlocking functions, which make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is dumped, meaning the stored beam is diverted into a target designed to absorb and contain its energy.

Elements that are used in beamlines by experimenters for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station include the following:

*Windows: windows are used to separate UHV and HV vacuum sections and to terminate the beamline. They are also used between UHV vacuum sections to provide protection from vacuum accidents. The foils used for the window membrane also attenuate the radiation spectrum in the region below 6KeV.
1- Beryllium Windows: Beryllium windows can be supplied cooled, or uncooled, with various sizes (and numbers) of window apertures. Windows are sized to suit specific requirements, however the maximum size of a window is determined by the foil thickness and pressure differential to be withstood. Windows can be supplied fitted with a range of beam entry/exit flange sizes to suite specific requirements.
2- CVD Diamond Windows: Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) Diamond offer extreme hardness, high thermal conductivity, chemical inertness, and high transparency over a very wide spectral range. Stronger and stiffer than Beryllium, with lower thermal expansion and lower toxicity, it is ideal for UHV isolation windows in X-ray beamlines. Windows can be supplied embedded in UHV flanges and with efficient water cooling.
3- Exit Windows: Vacuum exit windows come in a variety of materials including Beryllium and CVD diamond detailed above.

*Slits: Slits are used to define the beam either horizontally or vertically. They can be used in pairs to define the beam in both directions. the maximum aperture size is selected to suit specific requirements. Options include cooled (white beam operation) or uncooled (monochromatic beam operation) slits and phosphor coating on the upstream side of the slit to assist with beam location. There are four main type of slits: Blade Slits, High Heat Load Slits, Inline Slits, High Precision Slits.
*Shutters: Beam shutters are used to interrupt radiation from the front end, or optics enclosures when it is not required downstream. They have an equipment and personnel safety function. And there are three types of shutters; Photon Shutters, Monochromatic Beam Shutters, Custom Shutters
*Beam Filters: (or attenuators) remove unwanted energy ranges from the beam by passing the incident synchrotron radiation through a thin transmissive foil. They are often used to manage heat-loads of white beams to optimize beamline performance according to the energy of operation. A typical filter has two or three racks, with each rack holding three of four separate foils, depending upon the beam cross-section.

*Focusing mirrors - one or more mirrors, which may be flat, bent-flat, or toroidal, which helps to collimate (focus) the beam
*Monochromators - devices based on diffraction by crystals which select particular wavelength bands and absorb other wavelengths, and which are sometimes tunable to varying wavelengths, and sometimes fixed to a particular wavelength
*Spacing tubes - vacuum maintaining tubes which provide the proper space between optical elements, and shield any scattered radiation
*Sample stages - for mounting and manipulating the sample under study and subjecting it to various external conditions, such a varying temperature, pressure etc.
*Radiation detectors - for measuring the radiation which has interacted with the sample

The combination of beam conditioning devices controls the thermal load (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or liquid nitrogen. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under ultra high vacuum conditions.

===Software for beamline modeling===
Although the design of a synchrotron radiation beamline may be seen as an application of X-ray optics, there are dedicated tools for modeling the x-ray propagation down the beamline and their interaction with various components. There are ray-tracing codes such as Shadow and McXTrace that treat the x-ray beam in the geometric optics limit, and then there are wave propagation software that takes into account diffraction, and the intrinsic wavelike properties of the radiation. For the purposes of understanding full or partial coherence of the synchrotron radiation, the wave properties need to be taken into account. The codes SRW, Spectra and xrt include this possibility, the latter code supports &quot;hybryd&quot; regime allowing to switch from geometric to wave approach on a given optical segment.

==Neutron beamline==
Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a research reactor or a spallation source instead of photons. Since neutrons don&#x27;t carry charge and are difficult to redirect, the components are quite different (see e.g. choppers or neutron super mirrors). The experiments usually measure neutron scattering from or energy transfer to the sample under study.

<doc id="515386" wikidata="Q1571319" url="?curid=515386" title="Wild Weasel">
<text>Wild Weasel is a code name given by the United States Air Force (USAF) to any aircraft equipped with anti-radiation missiles and used to suppress enemy air defenses by destroying their radar and surface-to-air missile (SAM) installations. A Wild Weasel pilot baits an enemy into targeting their aircraft with their radars, then traces the radar emissions back to their source, allowing the Weasel or its teammates to precisely target it for destruction.

The USAF developed the Wild Weasel concept in 1965 during the Vietnam War after Soviet SAMs began downing American strike aircraft participating in Operation Rolling Thunder over North Vietnam. The program was headed by General Kenneth Dempster.
&quot;The first Wild Weasel success came soon after the first Wild Weasel mission 20 December 1965 when Captains Al Lamb and Jack Donovan took out a site during a Rolling Thunder strike on the railyard at Yen Bai, some northwest of Hanoi&quot;, wrote historian Walter J. Boyne.
Wild Weasel tactics and techniques were adopted by other nations and integrated into U.S. efforts to suppress enemy air defenses to establish air supremacy before full-scale conflict.

The missions were known by the operational code &quot;Iron Hand&quot; when first authorized on 12 August 1965, though technically this term referred only to the suppression attack before the main strike. The term &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; derives from Project Wild Weasel, the USAF development program for a dedicated SAM-detection and suppression aircraft. Originally named &quot;Project Ferret&quot;, denoting a predatory animal that goes into its prey&#x27;s den to kill it (hence: &quot;to ferret out&quot;), the name was changed to differentiate it from the code-name &quot;Ferret&quot; that had been used during World War II for radar-countermeasures bombers.

==Equipment==

===Wild Weasel I===
The Wild Weasel concept was proposed in 1965 to counter the increasing North Vietnamese SAM threat. Air Force crews flew the two-seat F model of the F-100 Super Sabre, while the United States Navy primarily relied upon the A-4 Skyhawk. The F-100F Wild Weasel lacked the performance characteristics to survive in a high threat environment. The first Wild Weasel squadron was the 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron based at Takhli Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand. After 45 days of operations against North Vietnamese targets, the 354th had one airplane left and of the 16 aircrew members, four had been killed, two were prisoners of war, three had been wounded and two had quit.

===Wild Weasel II and III===
The Wild Weasel II version was the first unsuccessful attempt to use the F-4C Phantom as a Wild Weasel platform. When that effort failed, the Wild Weasel role was then passed to the F-105F in the summer of 1966. The F-105F was converted for the role and was designated Wild Weasel III. The F-105F was equipped with more advanced radar, jamming equipment, and a heavier armament. Anti-radiation missiles were outfitted that could seek out radar emplacements. The F-105F Wild Weasel airframes were eventually modified with improved countermeasures components in a standardized configuration and designated the F-105G. The F-105G was also designated Wild Weasel III; 61 F-105F units were upgraded to F-105G specifications. Although in some documentation the F-105F was referred to as an EF-105F, that designation never existed in the operational flying squadrons.

===Wild Weasel IV===
The F-105 was no longer in production by 1964. With severe combat attrition of the F-105 inventory, the need for a more sophisticated aircraft resulted in the conversion of 36 F-4C Phantom II aircraft, designated F-4C Wild Weasel IV. The F-4C Wild Weasel IV also bore the unofficial designation of EF-4C.
===Wild Weasel V===
The F-4E, the most advanced Phantom variant with extensive ground-attack capabilities and an internal gun, became the basis for the F-4G Wild Weasel V (also known as the Advanced Wild Weasel). This modification consisted of removing the gun and replacing it with the APR-38(t) Radar Homing and Warning Receiver (later upgraded to the APR-47), and a cockpit upgrade for the back seat to manage the electronic combat environment. A total of 134 F-4G models were converted from F-4Es with the first one flying in 1975. Squadron service began in 1978.

F-4Gs were deployed to three active wings. One was stationed at George AFB, Victorville, California, as part of the Rapid Deployment Force; one wing was assigned to USAFE (US Air Forces in Europe) at Spangdahlem AB, Germany; and the other to PACAF (Pacific Air Forces) at Clark AB, Philippines. F-4Gs from George AFB, Clark AB and Spangdahlem AB saw combat during &quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot; in 1991, successfully protecting strike packages from enemy air defenses. During this conflict the F-4G saw heavy use, with only a single loss: an aircraft from Spangdahlem AB crashed in Saudi Arabia while returning from a mission, after one of the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles hang fired which left the aircraft&#x27;s instruments not displaying the correct altitude information and a significant frame tweak from the damage made the plane hard to control. After an investigation into the loss of the aircraft which occurred during several aborted landing attempts in a sandstorm, it was determined that a fuel cell was punctured by anti-aircraft fire. The pilot and EWO safely ejected after the engines shut down when the aircraft ran out of fuel attempting to land at a forward airstrip.

After &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, some of the George AFB aircraft were assigned to the 124th Wing of the Air National Guard at Boise, Idaho, 190th Fighter Squadron. Aircraft from Spangdahlem, Clark, and the remainder from George were assigned to the 561st Fighter Squadron, 57th Fighter Wing (Active Duty) at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas. The aircraft remained in service until 1996, with both squadrons participating in frequent deployments to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in support of Operation Provide Comfort, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Vigilant Warrior enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq. By this time the F-4G was the last operational variant of the Phantom II in the US forces. Many of the airframes were later used as target drones and Aircraft Battle Damage Repair training aids.

===Current===

A change in aircraft design theory to stress versatile multi-role aircraft meant that the F-4G Phantom was the last aircraft in the USAF inventory specifically outfitted for the SEAD role. The Wild Weasel mission is now assigned to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, using the Block 50 and Block 52, with production beginning in 1991. The single-seat Block 50/52 F-16C is specifically tasked with this mission and aircraft modified for this mission are designated F-16CJ/DJ. The pilot now performs both the role of flying the airplane and targeting and employing against ground threats. Other aircraft, while capable of engaging anti-air emplacements, are typically tasked with other primary missions; the A-10 Thunderbolt II &quot;Warthog&quot;, primarily tasked with CAS missions, lacks the avionics to perform a true SEAD mission and does not carry the AGM-88 HARM. The F-15E Strike Eagle, possessing advanced air-to-ground avionics but also high speed and long range, is typically tasked with &quot;deep strike&quot; missions, which can include SAM installations but typically focuses on high-value targets such as enemy command &amp; control, infrastructure and production, and likewise does not carry HARM.

The ECR variant of the Panavia Tornado is dedicated to SEAD missions and is currently operated by the German Air Force and Italian Air Force. The Royal Air Force used the GR4 variant to conduct similar missions utilising the ALARM missile, though they were mainly used in the interdiction/CAS role. The RAF retired the ALARM missile in 2013 and retired the Tornado in 2019.

The F-35 Lightning II is slated to gradually replace these aircraft for various air-to-ground roles, including SEAD, beginning with its introduction in 2016. Its stealth capabilities promise a significant increase in effectiveness against air-defence radars, though to maintain its lowest radar signature, its payload capacity would be limited to the internal weapons bays, reducing the number of missile site attacks per sortie. However, it can carry more or larger air to ground weapons internally than even the F-22 and is more advanced in a ground attack capacity, potentially making it the best crewed aircraft for destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses. Additionally, the AGM-88G AARGM-ER, itself an evolution of the AGM-88 HARM, is being integrated into all three variants of the F-35. The F-35A and F-35C will have the ability to carry the AARGM-ER internally, while the F-35B will only be able to carry the missile externally owing to its smaller internal weapons bays.

==Mission tactics==
In 1966 over North Vietnam, Wild Weasel flights of four aircraft sometimes were led by a single F-105F/G two-seat aircraft (aided by its Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) with his electronic receivers and analyzers) plus three F-105Ds. Sometimes two &quot;F&quot;s, each with a &quot;D&quot; wingman, operated independently.

The Wild Weasel mission was to precede strike flights, clearing the target area of radar guided surface-to-air missile threats (predominantly SA-2 &#x27;Guideline&#x27; systems), leaving the threat area last, which sometimes would result in 3.5-hour missions, before returning to Royal Thai Air Force Bases. This was achieved by turning toward the air defense site in a threatening manner, firing radar homing missiles at the site, or visually locating the site to dive bomb it. These tactics were attempted while under attack by MiGs and anti-aircraft artillery.

The F-105F did not use radar jamming devices since its purpose was to provide a decoy target, protecting the strike flights, and encouraging SAM launches that generated enough bright smoke to make possible seeing the SAM site for immediate dive bombing attack. With multiple incoming missiles in visual sight it was possible to dive abruptly or sharply break to avoid them. Failure to see the missiles approaching at three times fighter cruise speed would result in the destruction of the aircraft and failure of the mission.

Vietnam War tactics of using &quot;Hunter-Killer&quot; teams, where an F-4G Wild Weasel would be teamed with one or more conventional F-4E Phantoms, were improved upon with the newer equipment. The Wild Weasel would destroy missile radar emitters, clearing the way for the F-4E&#x27;s to destroy the rest of the missile site using cluster munitions.

A tactic used during Operation Desert Storm was known as &quot;Here, kitty kitty&quot;, wherein one Weasel would get the attention of a SAM or anti-aircraft artillery site while other Weasels would then sneak up behind the site and destroy it.

In one of the Wild Weasel concept&#x27;s most famous uses in military operations, five F-105Gs, using the call-signs &quot;Firebird 01–05&quot;, provided support for the Son Tay P.O.W. rescue mission, which was conducted in the early morning hours of 21 November 1970. One of these aircraft was shot down by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile, but its crew ejected safely and was rescued by the HH-53 &quot;Super Jolly&quot; helicopters that also participated in the raid. None of the aircraft of the raiding force protected by Wild Weasels was lost to enemy action.

==Motto and traditions==

The unofficial motto of the Wild Weasel crews is YGBSM: &quot;You Gotta Be Shittin&#x27; Me&quot;. This appears prominently on the logo patch of some squadrons. As the story goes, this was the response of Jack Donovan, a former B-52 EWO (Electronic Warfare Officer):

This was the natural response of an educated man, a veteran EWO on B-52s and the like, upon learning that he was to fly back seat to a self-absorbed fighter pilot while acting as flypaper for enemy SAMs.

According to Dan Hampton in his memoir, &quot;Viper Pilot: A Memoir of Air Combat&quot;, Jack Donovan said:
&quot;You want me to fly in the back of a tiny little jet with a crazy fighter pilot who thinks he&#x27;s invincible, home in on a SAM site in North Vietnam, and shoot it before it shoots me? You&#x27;ve gotta be shittin&#x27; me!&quot;

The motto &quot;First in, Last out&quot; was also used.

The &quot;WW&quot; tailcode of the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing and the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing derives from their Wild Weasel heritage.

<text>Göbekli Tepe (, ; Kurdish: or , &#x27;Wish Hill&#x27;) is a Neolithic archaeological site in Upper Mesopotamia (&quot;al-Jazira&quot;) in modern-day Turkey. The settlement was inhabited from around to at least , during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillarsamong the world&#x27;s oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The high, tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.

The site was first used at the dawn of the southwest Asian Neolithic period, which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. Göbekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on a rocky mountaintop with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation, has played a prominent role in this debate.

Recent findings suggest a settlement at Göbekli Tepe, with domestic structures, extensive cereal processing, a water supply, and tools associated with daily life. This contrasts with a previous interpretation of the site as a sanctuary used by nomads, with few or no permanent inhabitants. No definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic structures, which have been popularly described as the &quot;world&#x27;s first temple[s]&quot;. They were likely roofed and appear to have regularly collapsed, been inundated by slope slides, and subsequently repaired or rebuilt. The architecture and iconography are similar to other contemporary sites in the vicinity, such as Karahan Tepe.

The site was first noted in a 1963 archaeological survey. German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt recognised its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year. After he died in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, Şanlıurfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. Göbekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as &quot;one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture&quot;. , about 10% of the site has been excavated. Additional areas were examined by geophysical surveys, which showed the mound to contain at least 20 large enclosures.

== Geography and environment ==
Göbekli Tepe is located in the Taş Tepeler (&#x27;Stone Hills&#x27;), in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains. It overlooks the Harran plain and the headwaters of the Balikh River, a tributary of the Euphrates. The site is a tell (artificial mound) on a flat limestone plateau. In the north, a narrow promontory connects the plateau to the neighbouring mountains. The ridge descends steeply into slopes and cliffs in all other directions.

The climate of the area was warmer and wetter when Göbekli Tepe was occupied than it is today. The site was surrounded by an open steppe grassland, with abundant wild cereals, including einkorn, wheat, and barley, and herds of grazing animals such as wild sheep, wild goat, gazelle, and equids. Large herds of goitered gazelle may have passed by the site in seasonal migrations. There is no evidence of substantial woodlands nearby; 90% of the charcoal recovered at the site was from pistachio or almond trees.

Like most Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) sites in the Urfa region, Göbekli Tepe was built at a high point on the edge of the mountains, giving it a wide view over the plain beneath and good visibility from the plain. This location also gave the builders good access to raw material: the soft limestone bedrock from which the complex was built and the flint to make the tools to work the limestone. The prehistoric village acquired drinking water through a rainwater harvesting system, consisting of carved channels that fed several cisterns carved into the bedrock under the site, which could hold at least of water. Additionally, the local water table may have been higher, activating springs closer to the site that are dormant today.

Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south, and west of a mulberry that marks an Islamic pilgrimage, but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team also found many tools that remain. At the western escarpment, a small cave was discovered, and a small relief depicting a bovid was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.

== Dawn of village life ==
Göbekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN, ). Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks &quot;the beginnings of village life&quot;, producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world. Archaeologists have long associated the appearance of these settlements with the Neolithic Revolution—the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture—but disagree on whether the adoption of farming caused people to settle down, or settling down caused people to adopt farming. Despite the name, the Neolithic Revolution in Southwest Asia was &quot;drawn out and locally variable&quot;. Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places, and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions. Archaeologists divide the Pre-Pottery Neolithic into two subperiods: the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA, ) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, and ). The earliest phases at Göbekli Tepe have been dated to the PPNA; later phases to the PPNB.

Evidence indicates the inhabitants of Göbekli Tepe were hunter-gatherers who supplemented their diet with early forms of domesticated cereal and lived in villages for at least part of the year. Tools such as grinding stones, mortars, and pestles found at the site have been analysed and suggest considerable cereal processing. Archaeozoological evidence hints at &quot;large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn.&quot;

PPN villages consisted mainly of clusters of stone or mud brick houses, but sometimes also substantial monuments and large buildings. These include the tower and walls at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), as well as large, roughly contemporaneous circular buildings at Göbekli Tepe, Nevalı Çori, Çayönü, Wadi Feynan 16, Jerf el-Ahmar, Tell &#x27;Abr 3, and Tepe Asiab. Archaeologists typically associate these structures with communal activities which, together with the communal effort needed to build them, helped to maintain social interactions in PPN communities as they grew in size.

The T-shaped pillar tradition seen at Göbekli Tepe is unique to the Urfa region but is found at most PPN sites. These include Nevalı Çori, Hamzan Tepe, Karahan Tepe, Harbetsuvan Tepesi, Sefer Tepe, and Taslı Tepe. Other stone stelae—without the characteristic T shape—have been documented at contemporary sites further afield, including Çayönü, Qermez Dere, and Gusir Höyük.
==Chronology==
Radiocarbon dating shows that the earliest exposed structures at Göbekli Tepe were built between 9500 and , towards the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period. The site was significantly expanded in the early and remained in use until around , or perhaps slightly later (the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, PPNB). There is evidence that smaller groups returned to live amongst the ruins after the Neolithic structures were abandoned.

Schmidt originally dated the site to the PPN based on the types of stone tools found there, considering a PPNA date &quot;most probable&quot;. Establishing its absolute chronology took longer due to methodological challenges. Though the first two radiocarbon dates were published in 1998, these and other samples from the of the structure dated to the late 10th and early 9th millennium – 500 to 1000 years later than expected for a PPNA site. Schmidt&#x27;s team explained the discrepancy in light of their theory that this material was brought to the site from elsewhere when it was abandoned, and so was not representative of the actual use of the structures. They instead turned to a novel method of dating organic material preserved in the plaster on the structure&#x27;s walls, which resulted in dates more consistent with a PPNA occupation, in the middle or even early . Subsequent research led to a significant revision of Schmidt&#x27;s chronology, including the abandonment of the hypothesis that the fill of the structures was brought from elsewhere, and a recognition that direct dates on plaster are affected by the old wood effect. Together with new radiocarbon dates, this has established the site&#x27;s absolute chronology as falling in the period 9500 to – the late PPNA and PPNB.

=== Building phases ===
The preliminary, now abandoned, stratigraphic model by Klaus Schmidt consisted of three architectural layers. The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.

The revised chronology consists of eight phases that span at least 1,500 years. It details the history of the large circular enclosures, including events that led to their alteration or abandonment, and the evolution of the domestic buildings surrounding them.
* Phase 1: The earliest settlement phase dates to the second half of the and includes the first versions of enclosures A to D and round-oval domestic structures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle.
* Phase 2: In the second phase (early ), significant modifications of enclosures A-D were undertaken: New walls were erected, which incorporated the first monolithic T-shaped pillars. An increasing number of domestic structures were built, still mostly oval-round, though with a rising tendency for a rectangular floor plan.
* Phases 3–5: In the early PPNB, the northern and western slopes saw the erection of rectangular (domestic) structures. They underwent multiple construction phases, such as adding benches with a T-shaped pillar and new inner walls, resulting in more rectangular rooms. The large enclosures were modified as well. Walls were repaired, and new ones were added. Benches were placed against the interior sides of phase 2 walls.&lt;br&gt; At the end of the early PPNB, a slope slide inundated the lower-lying structures, flushing sediments and domestic rubble (likely including midden and burials) downhill. This caused extensive damage to enclosure D and led to stabilisation works in Phase 5. Building C was reconstructed for the last time, and a terrace wall was placed above it to prevent future slope slides. Nonetheless, a second major slope-slide event occurred, which likely resulted in enclosure D being abandoned in the late .
* Phases 6 and 7: Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early ). The loss of enclosures B and D may have led to the construction of building G and the &quot;Lion Pillar Building&quot;. In Phase 7, another terrace wall was constructed in a last attempt to stabilise the northern slope.
* Phase 8: In the final occupation period, small habitation structures were built within the remains of the abandoned Neolithic village.

==Architecture==
===Large enclosures===
The first circular compounds appear around the latter half of the . They range from in diameter. Their most notable feature is the T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock. The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.

Two taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior. Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelle, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; arthropods such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of Çatalhöyük and Jericho.

Few humanoid figures have appeared in the art at Göbekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half; however, this suggests to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylised humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. Schmidt thought the horizontal stone slab on top symbolised shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless. Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolise venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is unknown.

Some of the floors in this, the oldest layer, are made of terrazzo (burnt lime); others are the bedrock from which pedestals hold the large pair of central pillars, which were carved in high relief. Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles .

Later enclosures were rectangular, perhaps to make more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic, but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture, during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have polished lime floors reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and . Several T-pillars up to 1.5 metres tall occupy the centre of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name &quot;lion pillar building&quot; by which their enclosure is known.

=== Slope slide events ===
The enclosures, lying over below the highest areas of the settlement, were subject to several slope slide events during the occupation period of Göbekli Tepe. A particularly severe one occurred at the end of the early PPNB, which inundated enclosure D with rubble of domestic structures and sediments, including burials and midden deposits. This caused severe damage to the enclosure, which led to repairs and stabilisation works to be conducted. At a later point, in Building Phase 5, terrace walls were erected, likely to prevent future damage from such events. However, these measures proved futile when a second major slope slide probably caused the enclosure to be abandoned during Building Phase 6, around the late 9th millennium BCE. Other enclosures suffered a similar fate, which might have led to new enclosures being constructed to replace them.

Previously, it had been assumed that the large enclosures were intentionally back-filled, an interpretation that has fallen out of favour since Klaus Schmidt&#x27;s death.

===Domestic structures===
In the earliest occupation phase, round-oval domestic structures were built alongside the large enclosures, which indicates a (semi) sedentary lifestyle. Over time, there was an increasing tendency for these buildings to have rectangular floor plans. In the final settlement phase, only small structures were erected.

=== Burials ===
Before any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building. In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult. Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period at Levantine sites such as Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), Tell Aswad, and Yiftahel, and later in Anatolia at Çatalhöyük.

===Other structures===
At the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. Flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been a sculpture workshop. It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.

Apart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a flat bench surrounding it. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called &quot;complex E&quot;. Owing to its similarity to the cult buildings at Nevalı Çori, it has also been called the &quot;Temple of the Rock&quot;. Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at Göbekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin and a staircase with five steps.

===Later structures===
The uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest period. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial centre.

Around the beginning of the , Göbekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the &quot;Stone-age zoo&quot; apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region&#x27;s older, foraging communities.

== Construction ==
The plateau Göbekli Tepe is situated on has been shaped by erosion and quarrying from the Neolithic onwards. There are four and channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the &quot;Limes Arabicus&quot;, though this is conjecture. Most structures on the plateau seem to result from Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks, then levered out of the rock bank. Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by finding a 3-by-3 metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally, Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered from the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of and its head has a width of . Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern plateau.

Archaeologists disagree on how much labour was needed to construct the site. Schmidt maintained that &quot;the work of quarrying, transporting, and erecting tons of heavy, monolithic, and almost universally well-prepared limestone pillars [...] was not within the capability of a few people&quot;. Using Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s experiments with the moai of Rapa Nui as a reference, he estimated that moving the pillars alone must have involved hundreds of people. According to these experiments, one &quot;moai&quot; of similar size to a T-shaped pillar from Göbekli Tepe would have taken 20 people a year to carve and 50–75 people a week to transport 15 km. Schmidt&#x27;s team has also cited a 1917 account of the construction of a megalith on the Indonesian island of Nias, which took 525 people three days. These estimates underpin their interpretation that the site was built by a large, non-resident workforce, coerced or enticed there by a small religious elite. However, others estimate that just 7–14 people could have moved the pillars using ropes and water or another lubricant, with techniques used to construct other monuments such as Stonehenge. Experiments at Göbekli Tepe itself have suggested that all the PPNB structures currently exposed could have been built by 12–24 people in less than four months, allowing for time spent quarrying stone and gathering, and preparing food. These labour estimates are thought to be within the capability of a single extended family or village community in the Neolithic. They also match the number of people that could have comfortably been inside one of the buildings simultaneously.

Enclosures B, C, and D were initially planned as a single, hierarchical complex that forms an equilateral triangle, according to Haklay and Gopher.

== Tools ==
Göbekli Tepe is littered with flint artifacts, from the ridge-top site to the slopes. The tool assemblage found resembles that of other Northern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic (settlement) sites.

In 1963, over 3,000 Neolithic tools were uncovered, the vast majority of excellent quality flint, only a handful of obsidian. Cores, various blades, flakes, scrapers, burins, and projectile points, were the most common tool types.

Excavations of Space 16, a small building adjacent to enclosure D, yielded almost 700 tools. Most common were retouched artifacts, followed by scrapers, perforators, and artifacts with gloss. Heavy duty tools, burins and microliths were also present.

Over 7000 grinding stones have been found, spanning the entirety of the site&#x27;s usage, which are suggested to have been used to process cereal based on phytoliths found in associated soil. However, it is unclear whether the cereal was wild or cultivated.

== Iconography ==
===Pillars===
The stone pillars in the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe are T-shaped, similar to other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the region. Unlike at these other sites, however, many of the pillars are carved – typically in low relief, though sometimes in high relief. Most carvings depict animals, mostly serpents, foxes, and boars, but also gazelle, mouflon (wild sheep), onager, ducks, and vultures. Insofar as they can be identified, the animals are male and often depicted with an aggressive posture.

Abstract shapes are also depicted as upright or horizontal H-shaped symbols, crescents, and disks. Depictions of humans are rare; pillar 43 in enclosure D includes a headless man with an erect phallus. However, the &#x27;T&#x27;-shape of the pillars themselves is anthropomorphic: the shaft is the body, and the top is the head. This is confirmed by the fact that some pillars include – in addition to animal reliefs – carvings of arms, hands, and loincloths.

The two central pillars occupied a special place in the symbolic architecture of the enclosures. Those in Enclosure D represent humans, with arms, a belt, and a piece of cloth that hides the genitals. The sex of the individuals depicted cannot be identified, though Schmidt suggested that they are two men because the belts they wear are a male attribute in the period. There is only one certain representation of a woman, depicted naked on a slab.

Schmidt and zooarchaeologist Joris Peters have argued that the variety of fauna depicted on the pillars means they likely do not express a single iconography. They suggest that, since many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation or served as totems.

===Other objects===
The structures at Göbekli Tepe have also yielded some smaller carved stones, which typically cannot be attributed to one period or another. The iconography of these objects is similar to that of the pillars, mostly depicting animals but also humans, again primarily male.

One of the structures contained a &quot;totem pole&quot; dating to the early PPNB. Reassembled, it is tall and in diameter. It depicts three figures (from top to bottom): a predator (a bear or large felid) with a missing head and the neck and arms of a human; another figure missing a head with human arms, likely male; and a third figure with a head that had survived intact. Snakes are carved on either side.

==Interpretation==

Klaus Schmidt&#x27;s view was that Göbekli Tepe was a stone-age mountain sanctuary. He suggested it was a central location for a cult of the dead and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Butchered bones found in large numbers from the local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants. Zooarchaeological analysis shows that gazelle were only seasonally present in the region, suggesting that events such as rituals and feasts were likely timed to occur during periods when game availability was at its peak. Schmidt saw the construction of Göbekli Tepe as contributing to the later development of urban civilization.

Schmidt also speculated on the belief systems of the groups that created Göbekli Tepe based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He presumed shamanic practices. He suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors. In contrast, he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in Mesopotamia, that was associated with extensive temples and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain Ekur, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic. It is apparent that the animal and other images do not indicate organised violence, i.e., there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions. Expanding on Schmidt&#x27;s interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu&#x27;s semiotic interpretation reads the Göbekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.

The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, &quot;similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.&quot; It is unknown why the existing pillars were buried every few decades to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one. According to Rémi Hadad, in recent years, &quot;the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see Göbekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.&quot; For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the &#x27;temple&#x27; narrative.

Claims have been made that it was an ancient astronomical observatory, but these have been largely rejected by the team working at the site.

==Research history==

Before being documented by archaeologists, the hill Göbekli Tepe stands on, known locally in Kurdish as or ( meaning &#x27;Wish Hill&#x27;), was considered a sacred place.

The archaeological site was first noted in 1963 as part of an archaeological survey directed by Halet Çambel of Istanbul University and Robert John Braidwood of the University of Chicago. American archaeologist Peter Benedict identified the stone tools collected from the surface of the site as characteristic of the Aceramic Neolithic, but mistook the upper parts of the T-shaped pillars for grave markers. The hill had long been under agricultural cultivation, and generations of local inhabitants had frequently moved rocks and placed them in clearance piles, which may have disturbed the upper layers of the site. At some point, attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks.

In October 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, who had previously been working at Nevalı Çori, was looking for evidence of similar sites in the area and decided to re-examine the location described by the Chicago researchers in 1963. Asking in nearby villages about hills with flint, he was guided to Göbekli Tepe by Mahmut Yıldız, whose family owned the land the site was situated on. The Yıldız family had previously discovered finds while ploughing there, which they reported to the local museum. Having found similar structures at Nevalı Çori, Schmidt recognised the possibility that the stone slabs were not grave markers as supposed by Benedict, but the tops of prehistoric megaliths. He began excavations the following year and soon unearthed the first of the enormous T-shaped pillars. Ultimately, he found only three tombs on the eastmost hill group, a pilgrimage destination. Yıldız went on to work on the excavations and serve as the site&#x27;s guard.

Schmidt continued to direct excavations at the site on behalf of the Şanlıurfa Museum and the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) until he died in 2014. Since then, the DAI&#x27;s research at the site has been coordinated by Lee Clare. , work on the site is conducted jointly by Istanbul University, the Şanlıurfa Museum, and the DAI, under the overall direction of Necmi Karul. Recent excavations have been more limited than Schmidt&#x27;s, focusing on detailed documentation and conservation of the areas already exposed.

==Conservation==
Göbekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as &quot;one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture&quot;. , about 10% of the site has been excavated.

Conservation work at the site caused controversy in 2018 when Çiğdem Köksal Schmidt, an archaeologist and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said that damage was caused by using concrete and &quot;heavy equipment&quot; while constructing a new walkway. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.

<doc id="515401" wikidata="Q44762" url="?curid=515401" title="Entre Ríos Province">
<text>Entre Ríos (, &quot;Between Rivers&quot;) is a central province of Argentina, located in the Mesopotamia region. It borders the provinces of Buenos Aires (south), Corrientes (north) and Santa Fe (west), and Uruguay in the east.

Its capital is Paraná (391,000 inhabitants), which lies on the Paraná River, opposite the city of Santa Fe.

Together with Córdoba and Santa Fe, since 1999, the province is part of the economic-political association known as the Center Region.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area that is now Entre Ríos were the Charrúa and Chaná who each occupied separate parts of the region. Spaniards entered in 1520, when Rodríguez Serrano ventured up the Uruguay River searching for the Pacific Ocean.

The first permanent Spanish settlement was erected in the current La Paz Department at the end of the 16th century. As governor of Asunción first and then of Buenos Aires, Hernandarias conducted expeditions to Entre Ríos unexplored lands. Juan de Garay, after founding Santa Fe, explored this area, which he called &quot;la otra banda&quot; (&quot;the other bank&quot;).

However, the region remained entirely indigenous and uninhabited by Europeans until a group of colonists from neighbouring Santa Fe Province settled on the Bajada del Paraná in the late seventeenth century, now the site of the provincial capital. At the same time towns appear, which we now know as Nogoyá, Victoria, Gualeguay, Gualeguaychú, Concepción del Uruguay and Concordia.

Tomás de Rocamora further explored the area in 1783 under the threat of a Portuguese invasion from Brazil, and gave official status to many of the above-mentioned towns. He was also the first to refer to the region as &quot;Entre Ríos&quot;. At this stage, European settlement was minimal, though during the May Revolution, the few colonists in the cities along the Paraná shore supported Manuel Belgrano and his army on his way to Paraguay.

On September 29, 1820, the leader (&quot;caudillo&quot;) Francisco Ramírez declared the territory an autonomous entity, the Republic of Entre Ríos. This lasted until his assassination on July 10 of the next year.

In 1853, in a meeting of all the provinces except Buenos Aires, Paraná was elected as the capital of the Argentine Confederation, and the Governor of Entre Ríos and leader &quot;(caudillo)&quot; Urquiza as its first president. The provincial capital was moved to Concepción del Uruguay. Later Urquiza, who had first won against Buenos Aires at the Battle of Cepeda in 1859, let his troops move back in the even Battle of Pavón in 1861, which allowed his rival Bartolomé Mitre from Buenos Aires to become president. At the time he was fulfilling his third term as governor of the province from 1860 to 1864 and after a voluntary interruption was reelected in 1886, but he was assassinated in 1870 after altogether 16 years of governing before finishing his mandate, which had probably been ordered by his supportor Ricardo López Jordán, not trusting him anymore.

Urquiza encouraged immigration through &quot;colonization contracts&quot;, setting up many agricultural colonies with European (mainly Volga Germans, Russians (including Russian Jews and Poles), Italians, Swiss and French) settlers. According to data of the 1903 census, of the 425,373 inhabitants of the province, 153,067 were immigrants.

==Economy==
Entre Rios&#x27; economy is the sixth largest in Argentina. Its output in 2006 was estimated at US$7.71 billion, or, US$6,710 per capita in 2006 (about a fourth less than the national average). In 2013, its output was estimated at $63.814 billion Pesos (about US$11.688 billion) or, 48,327 pesos (about US$8,851) per capita at current market prices. This was 21% below the average GDP per capita of 69,678 pesos (about US$12,762) for Argentina in 2013 at current market prices.

Its economy has long been more agricultural than the median in Argentina, comprising about 15% of output. Entre Rios&#x27; agricultural products include rice (60% of the national production), soybeans, wheat, maize, and citrus of which it is the second biggest producer, and exporting 16% of the production mainly to Europe.
Livestock production focuses on cattle (4.5 million head), and in sheep production in a decreasing proportion, covering 60,000 km2. The dairy industry, currently in expansion, produces almost 250 thousand tons per year of dairy products.

Of the national production of chickens and eggs, Entre Ríos contributes 37% of the first and 25% percent of the second. Another emerging production is honey and its derivatives, mainly for export.

Manufacturing has a sizable presence in Entre Rios, making up another 15% of output. Its industries are mostly linked to agriculture, as in food and drinks industry and flour and rice mills. Other industries include timber-wood, chemical, metallurgy, and machinery.

==Geography==
As part of the Mesopotamic region, the land is almost completely flat, with hills some 100 meters in height. There are two main systems of low hills, called &quot;lomadas&quot; or &quot;cuchillas&quot;: the Cuchilla de Montiel (west) and the Cuchilla Grande (east), which are separated by the Gualeguay River.

The name of the province means &quot;between rivers&quot;. Entre Ríos is limited and traversed by many rivers and streams: the Paraná River and its delta to the west and south; the Uruguay River and the Mocoretá River to the east; and the Guayquiraró River to the north.

Two national parks are located within the province: El Palmar National Park and Predelta National Park. There are also hot springs in several locations, especially along the basin of the Uruguay River, located in cities like Federación, Villa Elisa, Colón, etc.

===Climate===
The climate of Entre Rios is subtropical throughout with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification system, the province is classed as having a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). The mean annual precipitation throughout the province is 1,000 mm or more.

Based on observational data from 1991-2020, across the entire province, the average seasonal mean maximum and minimum temperature across the summer months (December-February) are 31 °C (max) and 18 °C (min), with an average seasonal mean temperature of 24 °C. For the winter months (June-August), the average seasonal mean temperatures are 18 °C (max) and 7 °C (min) with an average seasonal mean temperature of 13°C. Observed mean seasonal precipitation data for the same time period reports a mean seasonal precipitation of 371 mm in summer (December-February), 348 mm (March-May), 148 mm in winter (June-August) and 302 mm (September-November).

Differences exist within the climate of the province, with the northern parts being warmer than the central and southern parts, with the north experiencing more annual rainfall than the south, but with relatively dry winters, compared with southern parts of the province. but the south experiencing significantly more rainfall in the winter months particularly in the winter months (June-August). In the northern part of the province, towards the province of Corrientes, mean temperatures range from 13 °C in winter to 27 °C in summer, with a mean annual precipitation of 1,300 mm. In comparison, the climate of southern parts of the province, towards the province of Buenos Aires becomes slightly more temperate; mean temperatures range from 10 °C in winter to 26 °C in summer, with a mean annual precipitation of 1,000 mm with less variation in seasonal rainfall in winter.

==Government==

The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The legislative branch is a bicameral body composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing local laws. 

The Constitution of Entre Ríos Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Entre Ríos Provincial Police.

<doc id="515406" wikidata="Q2489335" url="?curid=515406" title="Monkey Dust">
<text>Monkey Dust is a British adult animated satirical sketch comedy series created by Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye. The series is characterised by its dark humour, frequent shifts in animation styles, and handling of taboo topics such as bestiality, murder, suicide and paedophilia. Three series were broadcast on BBC Three between 2003 and 2005. Following co-creator Thompson&#x27;s death, no further series were made.

==Characters==
==Episodes==
Each episode featured animation by several different companies including Slinky Pictures, Nexus Productions, Sherbet Animation, Caroline Mabey, Picasso Pictures, and VooDooDog, but is linked by recurring themes/jokes and seamless transitions between sketches. The episodes are untitled but instead are known by the characters introduced or the one-off sketches included. The principal writers and creators of the series were Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye, although other contributors were responsible for a significant proportion of the work; sometimes collaborating with Thompson and/or Pye; sometimes contributing fully formed sketches to the show. 

A short overview of the main characters, called a nocturne, set in the various characters&#x27; bedrooms with no dialogue and a depressing accompanying song, usually precedes the final section.

==Music==
The animation in each episode is accompanied by contemporary music which helps the transition between scenes. Numerous songs by Goldfrapp, Boards of Canada and Black Box Recorder feature. The theme music for all three series is by Eels (&quot;That&#x27;s Not Really Funny&quot; from &quot;Souljacker&quot;).

The inclusion of music from Goldfrapp during the first series would have pre-dated the commercial release of their debut album, but production on the series took so long that by the time of airing, Goldfrapp were about to release their second album. Thompson and Pye comment on this in the Series 1 DVD commentary.

==Release==
On 8 November 2004, the first series of &quot;Monkey Dust&quot; was released in the UK on DVD. Several musical substitutions had to be made from the television airing, as artists such as Cliff Richard and David Gray would not allow their work to be used on the DVD. Cover versions of the original songs were used instead.

The second and third series were broadcast on BBC Two and BBC Three respectively. Only the first series of &quot;Monkey Dust&quot; was commercially released on DVD; however, in September 2009 eight episodes from across series 2 and 3 (along with four episodes from the already released series 1) were made available for download from iTunes, though these are no longer available. Another reason for the lack of DVD releases of the later series is thought to be the &#x27;teenage jihadi&#x27; sketches being considered unsuitable in the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings that occurred a few months later.

== Reception ==

In 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; listed Harry Thompson as one of the 50 funniest or most influential people in British comedy, citing &quot;Monkey Dust&quot; as evidence and calling it: &quot;the most subversive show on television. The topical animated series is dark and unafraid to tackle taboo subjects such as paedophilia, taking us to Cruel Britannia, a creepy place where the public are hoodwinked by arrogant politicians and celebrities. This edgy show doesn&#x27;t always work, but when it does there is nothing quite like it&quot;. It has received positive reviews from &quot;Vice&quot; and &quot;Digital Spy&quot;.

==Awards==
*2003: International Student Jury Award (Banff Rockies Awards)
*2004: Best Multichannel Programme (Broadcast Awards)
*2004: Best Comedy (British Animation Awards)

<doc id="515408" wikidata="Q7098909" url="?curid=515408" title="Optically stimulated luminescence">
<text>In physics, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is a method for measuring doses from ionizing radiation. It is used in at least two applications:
* Luminescence dating of ancient materials: mainly geological sediments and sometimes fired pottery, bricks etc., although in the latter case thermoluminescence dating is used more often
* Radiation dosimetry, which is the measurement of accumulated radiation dose in the tissues of health care, nuclear, research and other workers, as well as in building materials in regions of nuclear disaster

The method makes use of electrons trapped between the valence and conduction bands in the crystalline structure of certain minerals (most commonly quartz and feldspar). The trapping sites are imperfections of the lattice — impurities or defects. The ionizing radiation produces electron-hole pairs: Electrons are in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The electrons that have been excited to the conduction band may become entrapped in the electron or hole traps. Under the stimulation of light, the electrons may free themselves from the trap and get into the conduction band. From the conduction band, they may recombine with holes trapped in hole traps. If the centre with the hole is a luminescence center (radiative recombination centre), emission of light will occur. The photons are detected using a photomultiplier tube. The signal from the tube is then used to calculate the dose that the material had absorbed.

The OSL dosimeter provides a new degree of sensitivity by giving an accurate reading as low as 1 mrem for x-ray and gamma ray photons with energies ranging from 5 keV to greater than 40 MeV. The OSL dosimeter&#x27;s maximum equivalent dose measurement for x-ray and gamma ray photons is 1000 rem. For beta particles with energies from 150 keV to in excess of 10 MeV, dose measurement ranges from 10 mrem to 1000 rem. Neutron radiation with energies of 40 keV to greater than 35 MeV has a dose measurement range from 20 mrem to 25 rem. In diagnostic imaging, the increased sensitivity of the OSL dosimeter makes it ideal for monitoring employees working in low-radiation environments and for pregnant workers.

To carry out OSL dating, mineral grains have to be extracted from the sample. Most commonly these are so-called coarse grains of 100-200 μm or fine grains of 4-11 μm. Occasionally other grain sizes are used.

The difference between radiocarbon dating and OSL is that the former is used to date organic materials, while the latter is used to date minerals. Events that can be dated using OSL are, for example, the mineral&#x27;s last exposure to sunlight; Mungo Man, Australia&#x27;s oldest human find, was dated in this manner.
It is also used for dating the deposition of geological sediments after they have been transported by air (aeolian sediments) or rivers (fluvial sediments). In archaeology, OSL dating is applied to ceramics: The dated event is the time of their last heating to a high temperature (in excess of 400 °C).

Recent OSL dating of stone tools in Arabia pushed the &quot;out-of-Africa&quot; date hypothesis of human migration back 50,000 years and added a possible path of migration from the African continent to the Arabian peninsula instead of through Europe.
The most widely-used OSL method is called single-aliquot regeneration (SAR).

<text>The term &quot;offshore company&quot; or &quot;offshore corporation&quot; is used in at least two distinct and different ways. An offshore company may be a reference to:
* a company, group or sometimes a division thereof, which engages in [[offshoring]] business processes.
* International business companies (IBC) or other types of legal entities, which are incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction, that prohibit local economic activities.

The former use (companies formed in offshore jurisdictions) is probably the more common usage of the term. In isolated instances, the term can also be used in reference to companies with offshore oil and gas operations.

==Companies from offshore jurisdictions==

In relation to companies and similar entities which are incorporated in offshore jurisdictions, the use of both the words &quot;offshore&quot; and &quot;company&quot; can be varied in application.

The extent to which a jurisdiction is regarded as offshore is often a question of perception and degree. Classic tax haven countries such as Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are quintessentially offshore jurisdictions, and companies incorporated in those jurisdictions are invariably labelled as offshore companies. Thereafter, there are certain small intermediate countries or areas such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Mauritius (sometimes referred to as &quot;mid-shore&quot; jurisdictions) which, whilst having oversized financial centres, are not zero tax regimes. Finally, there are classes of industrialised economies which can be used as part of tax mitigation structures, including countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and particularly the United Kingdom, in commentary relating to corporate inversion and the use of British Overseas Territories for this purpose. Furthermore, in Federal systems, states which operate like a classic offshore centre can result in corporations formed there being labelled as offshore, even if they form part of the largest economy in the world (for example, Delaware in the United States).

===Classifying offshore companies===

Historically, offshore companies were broadly divided into two categories. On the one hand were companies which were statutorily exempt from taxation in their jurisdiction of registration, provided that they did not undertake business with persons resident in that jurisdiction. Such companies were usually called International Business Companies, or IBCs. Such companies were largely popularized by the British Virgin Islands, but the model was copied widely. However, in the early 2000s the OECD launched a global initiative to prevent &quot;ring fencing&quot; of taxation in this manner, and many leading jurisdictions (including the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar) repealed their International Business Companies legislation. But IBCs are still incorporated in a number of jurisdictions today including Belize, Seychelles, BVI Anguilla and Panama.

Separately from IBCs, there are countries which operate tax regimes which broadly achieve the same effect: so long as the company&#x27;s activities are carried on overseas, and none of the profits are repatriated, the company is not subject to taxation in its home jurisdiction. Where the home jurisdiction is regarded as an offshore jurisdiction, such companies are commonly regarded as offshore companies. Examples of this include Hong Kong and Uruguay. However, these tax regimes are not limited to conventional offshore jurisdictions: the United Kingdom operates on broadly similar principles in relation to taxation of companies.

Separately, there are offshore jurisdictions which simply do not impose any form of taxation on companies, and so their companies are de facto tax-exempt. Historically the best example of these countries were the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, although other countries such as the British Virgin Islands have now moved to this model. These could arguably fit into either of the previous two categories, depending on the fiscal point of view involved.

To the Offshore Company definition, applies five (non-cumulative) limiting conditions:
(1) The government in the country of incorporation does not levy an indirect tax on the OAC (however, the OSC must pay an annual fee to the government).
(2) Separate laws and regulations apply.
(3) The OSC doesn&#x27;t have its own physical office (address), personnel, means of communication etc. This means that the OAC must have a representative (registered agent) and office address (registered office) in the county of the incorporation.
(4) The OSC must be managed and governed by (an employee of) a local trust or law office.
(5) There is an instance of elements that benefit anonymity such as bearer shares and no or limited filing obligations.

===Characteristics of offshore companies===
Although all offshore companies differ to a degree depending upon the corporate law in the relevant jurisdiction, all offshore companies tend to enjoy certain core characteristics:
* They are broadly not subject to taxation in their home jurisdiction.(UAE)
* The corporate regime will be designed to promote business flexibility.
* Regulation of corporate activities will normally be lighter than in a developed country.

The absence of taxation or regulation in the home jurisdiction does not exempt the relevant company from taxation or regulation abroad. For example, Michael Kors Holdings Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is subject both the U.S. taxation and to financial regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Another common characteristic of offshore companies is the limited amount of information available to the public. This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At one end of the scale, in the Cayman Islands and Delaware, there is virtually no publicly available information. But at the other end of the scale, in Hong Kong companies file annual returns with particulars of directors, shareholders and annual accounts. However, even in jurisdictions where there is relatively little information available to the public as of right, most jurisdictions have laws which permit law enforcement authorities (either locally or from overseas) to have access to relevant information, and in some cases, private individuals.

In relation to flexible corporate law, most offshore jurisdictions will normally remove corporate fetters such as thin capitalisation rules, financial assistance rules, and limitations on corporate capacity and corporate benefit. A number have also removed or watered down rules relating to maintenance of capital or restrictions on payment of dividends. Beyond the common themes, a number of jurisdictions have also enacted special corporate provisions to try to attract business through offering corporate mechanisms that allow complex business transactions or reorganisations to occur more smoothly.

===Uses of offshore companies===

Offshore companies are used for a variety of commercial and private purposes, some legitimate and economically beneficial, whilst others may be harmful or even criminal. Allegations are frequently made in the press about offshore companies being used for money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, and other forms of white collar crime. Offshore companies are also used in a wide variety of commercial transactions, from generic holding companies, to joint ventures and listing vehicles. Offshore companies are also used widely in connection with private wealth for tax mitigation and privacy. The use of offshore companies, particularly in tax planning, has become controversial in recent years, and a number of high-profile companies have ceased using offshore entities in their group structure as a result of public campaigns for such companies to pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of Government taxes.

Detailed information in relation to the use of offshore companies is notoriously difficult to come by because of the opaque nature of much of the business (and because, in many cases, the companies are used specifically to preserve the confidentiality of a transaction or individual). It is a commonly held view that most uses of offshore companies are driven by tax mitigation and/or regulatory arbitrage, although there are some suggestions that the amount of tax structuring may be less than commonly thought. Other commonly cited legitimate uses of offshore companies include uses as joint ventures financing SPVs, stock market listing vehicles, holding companies and asset holding structures, and trading vehicles.

=== Popularity of offshore company jurisdictions ===
In the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, the following jurisdictions saw the following numbers of new company registrations:

<text>The Cardigan Welsh corgi (; Welsh for &quot;dwarf dog&quot;) is one of two different varieties of livestock-herding dog breeds known as Welsh corgis (originating in Wales), with the other being the Pembroke Welsh corgi. It is one of the oldest breeds of the British Isles. Cardigan Welsh corgis are known to be an extremely loyal and trainable dog breed, naturally attuned to herding many different animals, from poultry and waterfowl to large livestock such as sheep and cattle. They are also versatile and can live in a variety of settings.

==History==
Pembroke Welsh and Cardigan Welsh corgis were both originally listed as one breed by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1925; the two varieties were officially recognized as distinct from one another by The Kennel Club by 1928, but were still categorized together under the title of &quot;Welsh Corgis&quot;. In 1934, due to judge preferences towards each breed separately, the two breeds were finally described as uniquely different and shown separately at dog shows. The official name was changed from Corgi (Welsh) to Cardigan Welsh Corgi in 2006. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen, South Wales. It was reported that the local members favoured the Pembroke corgis, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later in 1926. Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardised, through careful and selective breeding.

One theory, regarding the breed’s origin, is that both types of corgi descended from a line of northern, spitz-type dogs; a second theory is that they descended from the teckel family of dogs, which also is where the dachshund originated.

The word &quot;corgi&quot; is derived from the , which means &quot;dwarf dog&quot;. The breed was formerly called &quot;yard-long dog&quot; (). The name &quot;Cardigan Welsh corgi&quot; name comes from their area of origin in Wales, Cardigan (Welsh &#x27;Ceredigion&#x27;), and ironically not from their coat markings oftentimes resembling a &quot;cardigan&quot; or &quot;vest&quot; worn by the dog. It was brought to the US for the first time in June of 1931.

==Description==
The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox brush tail.

Originally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship. The old American Kennel Club standard called it an &quot;Alsatian on short legs&quot;. The Cardigan&#x27;s tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, whose tail may be long, naturally bobbed or docked). The Cardigan is also larger than the Pembroke.
Cardigans, which are double coated, come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle (a rare breed due to the challenges with breeding), with or without tan or brindle points. The Blue Merle coat, unique to the larger and more relaxed Cardigan Welsh Corgis, is characterized by black or grey speckles or marbling and pale blue or uniquely colored eyes. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the &quot;Irish pattern&quot;. Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk&#x27;s hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color.). An average Cardigan is around tall at the withers and weighs from for the male and for the female.

== Breeding ==
Male corgis can breed at any time throughout the year. While female corgis have different mating periods, they typically breed twice a year. They can conceive for about 21 days during each cycle, referred to as being &quot;in heat.&quot; Pregnancy lasts about two months, and the female can have a small or large litter of puppies, a process known as whelping. Newborn puppies are blind and deaf at birth, but begin to see after 10 days and hear after three weeks. Their first teeth emerge in two to three weeks, and they are weaned off milk after six weeks. By four to six months, adult teeth replace their baby teeth and they reach full maturity at two years old. 

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The most common causes of death in a 2004 Kennel Club survey were cancer (28.3%), old age (24.6%), and neurological disorders (15.2%).

Canine Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is known to occur in the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. This is likely due to the Cardigan being a dwarf (chondrodysplastic) breed, and these breeds frequently suffer from Type I disk disease. This disease is commonly found in the Dachshund breed.

The Cardigan Welsh Corgi can also inherit a vision disorder known as Progressive Retinal Atrophy, with cases discovered in Australia, USA, UK and the Netherlands.

==Temperament==
The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has a relaxed personality and tend to be less social. While they are cautious around strangers, their personality comes out when they become comfortable and playful.

Cardigan Welsh Corgis compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. These same herding instincts can show when around running children, this behavior must be coached to avoid nipping. Cardigan Welsh Corgis see themselves as part of a pack, similar to wild dogs. They view humans as fellow pack members, so at home, corgis establish their place within the family and other pets, acknowledging humans as the leaders.
* Cardigans are highly intelligent, active, athletic dogs.

<text>Piešťany (; , , , ) is a town in Slovakia. It is located in the western part of the country within the Trnava Region and is the seat of its own district. It is the biggest and best known spa town in Slovakia and has around 28,000 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
The name Piešťany comes from Slovak &quot;Piesok&quot; (sand), referring to local sandbanks. The etymology is straightforward – &quot;Piešťanci&quot; – people who live on the sandy site and &quot;Piešťany&quot; – their settlement.

==History==

The first human settlement in the area is dated to the prehistoric times, about 80,000 years ago. People were attracted to the site by abundance of game in the vicinity of the thermal springs that did not freeze in winter.

A small female statue representing female fertility called Venus of Moravany was found in the nearby village Moravany nad Váhom. It is made of mammoth ivory and is dated to 22,800 BC. It currently resides in the Bratislava Castle museum. In another nearby village, Krakovany-Stráže, a treasure consisting of luxury items made of glass, bronze, silver, and gold was discovered in three graves from 200 to 300 AD. The surroundings of Piešťany also include the Great Moravian castle of Ducové.

Piešťany was first mentioned in written records in 1113 (under the name Pescan). At that time it consisted of several smaller settlements. The medicinal springs were already popular in the Middle Ages. They were visited by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. The first book mentioning the Piešťany springs was &quot;De admirandis Hungariae aquis hypomnemation&quot; (About the Miraculous Waters of the Hungarian Monarchy) by Georgius Wernher, published in 1549 in Basel. In the 16th century, the Piešťany spa was also mentioned by two prominent physicians, Johann Crato de Crafheim (who served to several Holy Roman Emperors) and Andrea Baccius Elpidianus (a personal surgeon of the Pope). The first monography (&quot;Schediasma de Thermis Postheinsibus&quot; by was published in 1745. But in the 16th and 17th centuries, Piešťany also suffered from Turkish raids and anti-Habsburg uprisings.

Throughout the centuries Piešťany was owned by several noble families; the last of them, the Erdődys, owned the area from 1720 to 1848, and the spa until 1940. The Erdődy family built the first spa buildings in 1778. They were damaged by a destructive flood in 1813. In 1820 the spa buildings were expanded and remodeled in neo-classical style and named Napoleon spa. The Erdődy family also established the Spa park in this period. In the years 1889 to 1940 the Winter family rented the spa from the Erdődys and brought it to international fame. improved spa treatment as well as accommodation and entertainment for visitors. They built several spa buildings and hotels.

The spa attracted many aristocratic visitors, including Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1917, three monarchs (Wilhelm II of Germany, Karl I of Austria-Hungary, and Ferdinand I of Bulgaria) orchestrated their war strategy during the negotiations in the &quot;Thermia Palace&quot; hotel.

In 1945 Piešťany received the official status of a town. In 1959, Sĺňava water reservoir was built south of the town. In the late 1960s and 1970s more spa buildings were built. In 1973 the village of Banka, located on the left bank of the Váh river, was amalgamated with Piešťany, but it regained independence after a referendum in 1995. In 1996 the town became the seat of a district.

The 1938 World Fencing Championships were held in Piešťany.

On January 4, 1987, at the final match in the World Junior Championships of ice hockey between Canada and the Soviet Union there was a bench-clearing brawl, now famously known as the Punch-up in Piešťany. Both teams were disqualified from competition as a result.

On July 5, 2001, three members of the Real Irish Republican Army were arrested in Piešťany. They were lured into a trap by agents of the British Security Service MI5 who were posing as arms dealers from Iraq.

==Geography==
Piešťany is situated in the western part of Slovakia, in the valley of the Váh river, at an elevation of . The Považský Inovec mountains form the eastern boundary of this part of the Váh valley. The highest hill of these mountains, Inovec , is about north of the town. The hills immediately east of the town ( away) reach a height of about . On the western side, the valley boundary is formed by the Little Carpathians, which are somewhat lower and further away from the town. The valley is open to the south, and thus has a warm and sunny temperate climate.

Most of the town is located on the right bank of the river. South of the town is the Sĺňava water reservoir created by a dam on the Váh river. The artificial canal Biskupický kanál and the main river branch join in the town. Another short branch of the river (Obtokové rameno) creates the Spa Island.

The hills of Považský Inovec are mostly covered with deciduous forests. These consist of oak and hornbeam in the lower elevations, and beech in the higher elevations. The Váh valley is used for agriculture. The main products are cereals, sugar beet, animal feed, and pork.

Piešťany is located north-east of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, and north-east of the local regional seat Trnava. Upstream from Piešťany on the Váh river are the towns Nové Mesto nad Váhom ( north of Piešťany) and Trenčín ( north-east); downstream is Hlohovec.

Piešťany is located on the route of the D1 motorway from Bratislava to Žilina with connections to Vienna and Brno. The main railway route from Bratislava to Žilina and Košice also goes through the town. The town has an airport, mostly used for international charter flights for spa clients (10,000 passengers in 2007). The municipality operates a local public transport system with 11 bus routes ().

==Climate==
==Main sights==
Because of frequent floods in the past, most buildings are dated to the 19th and 20th century. The most notable exception are the ruins of a medieval monastery from the 13th century. The Napoleon Spa is a complex of Neoclassicist spa buildings built between 1822 and 1862. The town&#x27;s Catholic church dates from the same era. The Kolonádový most bridge, constructed by Emil Belluš in 1930–33, is a preeminent functionalist construction with many precious art objects.

The spa is located on the Spa Island between two branches of the Váh river, at the site of several hot springs with temperatures of . The water originates in a tectonic break at depth. The sulfate–carbonate water from the springs is used in pools and tubs. Sulfurous mud extracted from the bed of a side channel of the river is also used for treatment in the form of thermal mud pools with temperature and for partial and full body packs. Spring water and mud therapy is complemented by electrotherapy, exercise, massage, medication, and diet.

The spa is operated by the company Slovenské liečebné kúpele. The company was purchased in 2002 by Danubius Hotels Group. A small share is owned by the town. Danubius Hotels Group also owns hotels in Hungary, Mariánské Lázně spa in Czech Republic and Sovata spa in Romania.

<text>The Tyndale Monument is a tower built on a hill at North Nibley, Gloucestershire, England. It was built in honour of William Tyndale, an early translator of the New Testament into English, who was born nearby. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower was constructed in 1866 and is 111 ft (34 m) tall. It is possible to enter and climb up a spiral staircase composed of 121 steps to the top of the tower. The hill it is on allows a wide range of views, especially looking down to the River Severn. A nearby topograph points to some other landmarks visible. The hill on which the monument stands is quite steep. The path follows a rough fairly steep bridleway which is part of the Cotswold Way. The tower itself is surrounded by fencing and has floodlights that light up the tower at night. The stairway has automatic lighting. The Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes the foot of the monument, and then descends the hill into North Nibley.

The door to the tower is open most of the time for free access to a staircase which takes you to the top. Locally, it is commonly called Nibley Monument rather than its official name. The hill is called Nibley Knoll or Nibley Knob.

There is a commemorative plaque on the front of the tower. The text engraved on it reads:

:ERECTED A.D. 1866
:IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF
:WILLIAM TYNDALE
:TRANSLATOR OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE
:WHO FIRST CAUSED THE NEW TESTAMENT
:TO BE PRINTED IN THE MOTHER TONGUE
:OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
:BORN NEAR THIS SPOT HE SUFFERED
:MARTYRDOM AT VILVORDEN IN 
:FLANDERS ON OCT 6 1536

The monument is a landmark that can be seen even in places as far as Bristol, which is over 20 miles away. In the town of Thornbury there is a street called Tyndale View where the tower can be seen from approximately 10 miles away.

Further down the Cotswold Edge, at Hawkesbury, is the Somerset Monument, erected in 1846, and the design of the Tyndale tower has features in common with this.

In October 2019 protesters from Extinction Rebellion used the monument to display a protest banner.

<text>Jens Ingemar &quot;Ingo&quot; Johansson (; 22 September 1932 – 30 January 2009) was a Swedish professional boxer who competed from 1952 to 1963. He held the world heavyweight title from 1959 to 1960, and was the fifth heavyweight champion born outside the United States. Johansson won the title by defeating Floyd Patterson via third-round stoppage, after flooring him seven times in that round. For this achievement, Johansson was awarded the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year—the only non-American in its entire 27-year first run—and was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsman of the Year.

Johansson also held the European heavyweight title twice, from 1956 to 1958 and from 1962 to 1963. As an amateur he won a silver medal in the heavyweight division at the 1952 Summer Olympics. He affectionately named his right fist &quot;toonder and lightning&quot; for its concussive power (it was also called &quot;Ingo&#x27;s bingo&quot; and the &quot;Hammer of Thor&quot;), and in 2003 he was ranked at No. 99 on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Johansson&#x27;s introduction to the top rank of the sport was inauspicious. At age nineteen he was disqualified for passivity at the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympics in the heavyweight competition in a fight against eventual Olympic gold medalist Ed Sanders. Johansson maintained he was not evading Sanders (who also got a warning for passivity), but rather was trying to tire his opponent. Johansson said he had been limited to a 10-day training camp, had only trained with newcomers, and had been told by his coach to let Sanders be the aggressor. Nevertheless, his silver medal was withheld for poor performance and presented to him only in 1982.

Johansson had earned his spot in the Olympics by winning the Swedish National Championship earlier the same year, 1952, after he knocked out his opponent in the first round of the final.
After the Olympics Johansson went into seclusion for six months and considered quitting boxing. However, he returned to the ring and turned professional under the guidance of the Swedish publisher and boxing promoter Edwin Ahlquist, subsequently winning his first 21 professional fights. He won the Scandinavian pro title by knocking down and outscoring the Dane Erik Jensen (breaking his right hand in the process). A broken hand and a one-year military service kept him out of the ring until late 1954. In August 1955, in his twelfth professional fight, Johansson knocked out former European Heavyweight Champion Hein ten Hoff in the first round. He took the Scandinavian heavyweight title in 1953 and, on 30 September 1956, he won the European Heavyweight Championship by scoring a 13th-round KO over Italy&#x27;s Franco Cavicchi in Milan.

Johansson successfully defended his European crown against ranked heavyweights Henry Cooper (fifth-round KO on 19 May 1957) and Joe Erskine, with a TKO in round 13 on 21 February 1958.

===World heavyweight champion===

Johansson earned his shot at the world heavyweight crown when he knocked out top ranked contender Eddie Machen in the first round of their elimination match on 14 September 1958. In front of 53,615 fans in Ullevi football stadium, Johansson downed Machen three times, finally finishing him with a barrage of punches at 2:16 of the first round. Johansson then signed to fight champion Floyd Patterson.

Johansson was a colourful figure in New York City as he trained for the fight. Eschewing the monastic training regimen favored by Patterson and other fighters, Johansson trained at the Catskill resort of Grossingers. He did not seem to train particularly hard, and was often seen at night spots with his attractive girlfriend, Elaine Sloane, whom he asked out while she was working for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

He entered the ring in Yankee Stadium on 26 June 1959, as a 5–1 underdog.
Johansson spent the first two rounds of the encounter retreating and flicking a light left jab at the champion. In the third round, Johansson threw a wide left hook that Patterson blocked with his right hand. When he moved his right hand away from its protective peek-a-boo position before his chin, Johansson drilled him with a short powerful right hand. Patterson went down, arose on unsteady legs and was out on his feet. Johansson followed up his advantage and sent Patterson down six more times in the round before the bout was stopped by referee Ruby Goldstein. Johansson celebrated with his girlfriend and future wife Birgit Lundgren and the next day a headline in a New York newspaper expressed the city&#x27;s amazement. It read: &quot;Ingo – It&#x27;s Bingo.&quot; When Johansson returned to Sweden, he flew in on a helicopter, landing in the main football stadium in Gothenburg, his home town, and was cheered by 20,000 people. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, as well as the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 20 July 1959, alongside Birgit.

Johansson was a flamboyant champion – a precursor to the &quot;Swinging Sixties&quot;. One publication dubbed Johansson &quot;boxing&#x27;s Cary Grant&quot; and in 1960 he appeared in the movie &quot;All the Young Men&quot; as a marine, alongside stars Alan Ladd and Sidney Poitier. Wherever he went, in the U.S. or in Sweden, he had a beautiful woman on his arm, with paparazzi snapping pictures.

At that point, retired heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano, who sat ringside and witnessed as Johansson knocked out Patterson, considered a possible comeback for a championship bout versus Johansson. He entered a training camp, keeping it low profile, but dropped the idea because he could not get into the condition he previously had, feeling he was too old for a title fight.

===Rematch with Patterson===
Johansson proposed to his girlfriend Birgit in April 1960 after the champion visited Egypt. Then he turned his attention to defending his title against Floyd Patterson. The two signed for a rematch on 20 June 1960. Patterson knocked Johansson out in the fifth round with a leaping left hook to become the first man to recover the world&#x27;s undisputed heavyweight title. The punch caught Johansson&#x27;s chin and he hit the canvas with a thud, out cold before he landed flat on his back. With blood trickling from his mouth, his glazed eyes staring up at the ring lights, and his left foot twitching, the Swede was counted out. After the count, Patterson showed his concern for Johansson by cradling his motionless opponent, and promising him a second rematch. Johansson lay flat on his back on the canvas for five minutes before he was placed on a stool brought into the ring. He was still dazed and unsteady fifteen minutes after the knockout as he was helped out of the ring.

===Third match with Patterson===
Patterson and Johansson fought their final match on 13 March 1961. Johansson appeared to be in the worst physical condition of his three bouts with Patterson. A. J. Liebling, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, said the outcome seemed preordained and that Johansson was not dieting for the fight, eating creamed chicken, strawberry shortcake, and cherry cheesecake. Nonetheless, the fight was competitive. Johansson caught Patterson leaping at him in the very first round and knocked him down. He followed his advantage up by scoring another knockdown, but was himself caught going in wide open by that famous Patterson left hook, resulting in a knockdown. As the fight progressed, it became obvious that Johansson was spent. Patterson won when the referee swiftly stopped the contest in round six after Johansson had been knocked down once again.

===Later career and retirement===
Johansson, then only 29, returned to Europe. He recaptured the European crown from Dick Richardson by an eight-round KO on 17 June 1962. By this time, Sonny Liston had captured the heavyweight crown from Patterson, and efforts were underway to match Johansson with Liston.

Johansson, however, fought journeyman heavyweight Brian London on 21 April 1963, in a non-title 12-round match. Johansson won most of the rounds but seldom threw a serious right-hand punch with the exception of round seven when a short right from Johansson staggered London (&quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, April 22, 1963, p. 24). In round 12, with four seconds remaining in the fight, London hit Johansson with a powerful right hand that knocked him on his back. Johansson arose at the count of four, just as the bell rang to end the fight. Johansson was groggy, but was the points winner. UPI scored the fight 11–1 in favour of Johansson (&quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, April 22, 1963, p. 24).

The next day, the front page of Stockholm&#x27;s newspapers showed a photo of him dizzy, climbing the ropes, with the headline &quot;Wake up Ingo – You won!&quot; After seeing this, he wrote a letter to the European Boxing Union resigning his title and retiring from boxing at the age of 30.

==Life after boxing==
Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Patterson became good friends who flew across the Atlantic to visit each other every year.

Johansson made several films in Sweden and appeared as a marine in the Korean War film &quot;All the Young Men&quot; (1960). In the 1960s along with other business interests, Johansson co-promoted boxing cards in Sweden, including several with ex-champ Sonny Liston (1966 and 1967). On 22 April 1966, he boxed a five-round exhibition with European Heavyweight Champion Karl Mildenberger for his first co-promotion. He also owned a fishing boat and a bar called &quot;Ingo&#x27;s&quot;.

By the 1970s, he resided in Pompano Beach, Florida, where he owned a hotel. He ran in marathons (including the New York City Marathon and Boston Marathon) all over the world until the mid-1980s. In 1985 he completed the Stockholm Marathon.

During the 1990s, Johansson and Patterson would attend boxing conventions and also sign their autographs on boxing memorabilia. They continued to be friends until the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease incapacitated them both. It is believed now that both suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as it has been discovered in many contact and combat sports athletes, including boxing, although his career was fairly short compared with some champions. In the 1990s Johansson&#x27;s business interests in Sweden included sports apparel and a light lager beer called &quot;Hammer&quot;, named for his punching prowess.

In 2000, the Swedish Sports Academy selected Johansson as Sweden&#x27;s third-best athlete of the 20th century, behind tennis great Björn Borg and Alpine skiing great Ingemar Stenmark. In 2002, he was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Having suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia since the mid-1990s, he lived in a nursing home in Kungsbacka while his health deteriorated. In the later stages of his illness, he was reunited with his second wife, Birgit, who was at his side when he died on 30 January 2009, from complications following pneumonia. At the time of his death, he was at age 76 the oldest living heavyweight champion. Johansson was married three times and is survived by five children.

In January 2011, the 1959 Johnny Lion song &quot;Ingemar Johansson&quot;, which chronicles the 1959 Patterson fight, was re-released on the compilation album &quot;From The Vault: The Coed Records Lost Master Tapes, Volume 1&quot;.

==Legacy==
While his victory over Floyd Patterson was a huge upset at the time, Johansson&#x27;s standing within heavyweight history is fairly poor. Considered to be an ordinary fighter with a very good right hand, the Swede was perhaps fortunate to have met Patterson, one of history&#x27;s more vulnerable heavyweight champions, for the title. Patterson also likely took the challenge of Johansson lightly, given the Swede&#x27;s apparently lackadaisical approach to training. This was also at a time when it was considered a virtual impossibility that a European heavyweight could inflict a defeat on an American champion on U.S. soil. Furthermore, Patterson had defended the title just 56 days previously, against Britain&#x27;s Brian London, and likely considered Johansson to be another inept challenger from Europe.

Johansson&#x27;s world title victory is still historically significant within European boxing, as he became only the fourth-ever European to become heavyweight champion, and the first since Primo Carnera in 1933, who lost the title to Max Baer almost exactly 25 years before Johansson&#x27;s triumph. Johansson would be the last European to win the heavyweight title until Italy&#x27;s Francesco Damiani became the inaugural WBO heavyweight champion in May 1989. As the WBO was a fledgling sanctioning body at the time and not considered a legitimate world title, it was not until Great Britain&#x27;s Lennox Lewis was awarded the WBC title in 1992, 33 years after Johansson&#x27;s victory over Patterson, that a European again held a recognized version of the heavyweight title. It was also not until 1999, when Lewis unified the titles against Evander Holyfield, that a European again held the undisputed heavyweight championship, as Johansson had 40 years earlier. Johansson was also the last non-American to hold the heavyweight title until South Africa&#x27;s Gerrie Coetzee won the WBA version in 1983.

Despite never successfully defending the title, Johansson can claim to have been a heavyweight champion in two decades (the 1950s and 1960s). He was the first heavyweight champion to lose the title to the man whom he had beaten to become champion since Ezzard Charles&#x27;s loss to Jersey Joe Walcott in 1951. This would not happen again until September 1978, when Leon Spinks dropped the title back to Muhammad Ali, having beaten him in February of that year to become champion.

Outside of Europe, Johansson is best remembered as the opponent whom Patterson beat to become the first man to regain the heavyweight championship. As this loss, and the one which he suffered to the American in their third fight, are his only defeats, Johansson is one of four heavyweight champions to have retired with victories over every opponent he faced as a professional. The others are Rocky Marciano, Gene Tunney and Lennox Lewis.
Although the win over Patterson to claim the heavyweight title is his most famous, Johansson&#x27;s first-round victory over the undefeated American, Eddie Machen, in 1958 is also noteworthy and provides evidence of the power the Swede held in his right hand. Machen would go on to take Sonny Liston the twelve-round distance in 1960 and lasted into the tenth round against Joe Frazier in 1966.

Johansson also held the European Boxing Union Heavyweight title on two occasions, scoring stoppage victories over notable foes such as Henry Cooper, Dick Richardson and Joe Erskine.

<doc id="515426" wikidata="Q190562" url="?curid=515426" title="Mount Cameroon">
<text>Mount Cameroon is an active volcano in the South West region of Cameroon next to the city of Buea near the Gulf of Guinea. Mount Cameroon is also known as Cameroon Mountain or Fako (the name of the higher of its two peaks) or by its indigenous name Mongo ma Ndemi (&quot;Mountain of Greatness&quot;). Mount Cameroon is ranked 22nd by topographic isolation.

It is the highest point in sub-Saharan western and central Africa, the fourth-most prominent peak in Africa, and the 31st-most prominent in the world.
The mountain is part of the area of volcanic activity known as the Cameroon Volcanic Line, which also includes Lake Nyos, the site of a disaster in 1986. The most recent eruption occurred on February 3, 2012.

== Description ==

Mount Cameroon is one of Africa&#x27;s largest volcanoes, rising to above the coast of west Cameroon.

==Flora==
The mountain&#x27;s natural vegetation varies with elevation. The main plant communities on the mountain include:
* Lowland rain forest predominates on the lower slopes, from sea level to elevation. The lowland forests are part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion. They are composed of evergreen trees with a dense canopy high, with taller emergent trees rising above the canopy. Many trees have buttress roots. The forests are diverse and species-rich, with numerous lianas. Much of the lowland forest has been converted to agriculture and agroforestry, including oil palm plantations. 
* Lower montane forest, also known as submontane forest or cloud forest, grows between elevation. The lower montane forests are composed of evergreen trees, which form a canopy that is either closed or discontinuous. There are scattered areas of meadow and scrubland, with grasses, herbs, tall herbaceous plants (including Acanthaceae), tree ferns, woody shrubs, and low trees. Frequent clouds and mists sustain profuse epiphytes, including mosses, ferns, and orchids. The lower montane forests are diverse and species-rich, with characteristic Afromontane plants and endemic species. &quot;Impatiens etindensis&quot; and &quot;I. grandisepala&quot; are herbaceous epiphytes endemic to the montane forests of Mount Cameroon. The lower montane forests, together with the higher-elevation forests, scrub, and grasslands, are part of the Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests ecoregion.
* Upper montane forest grows from elevation. Trees up to high form an open-canopied forest with numerous epiphytes. The upper montane forests are less species-rich than the lower-elevation forests, and fires are more frequent.
* Montane scrub grows between elevation. Low trees of form open-canopied forests, woodlands, and shrublands, with an understory of small shrubs, herbs, ferns, and climbers. 
* Montane grassland occurs between elevation. The dominant vegetation is tussock grasses, with scattered fire-tolerant shrubs and low trees.
* Sub-alpine grassland is found at the highest elevations, from to over . Frost-tolerant tussock grasses, dwarf trees and shrubs, and crustose, foliose, and fruticose lichens predominate.

==Fauna==
Large mammals on the mountain include the African forest elephant (&quot;Loxodonta cyclotis&quot;), with a population of over 100 individuals. Other herbivores include red river hog (&quot;Potamochoerus porcus&quot;), bushbuck (&quot;Tragelaphus scriptus&quot;), bay duiker (&quot;Cephalophus dorsalis&quot;), blue duiker (&quot;Philantomba monticola&quot;), and yellow-backed duiker (&quot;Cephalophus sylvicultor&quot;). The mountain is home to several species of primates, including chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;), drill (&quot;Mandrillus leucophaeus&quot;), red-capped mangabey (&quot;Cercocebos torquatus&quot;), putty-nosed monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus nictitans&quot;), mona monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus mona&quot;), red-eared monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus erythrotis&quot;), Preuss&#x27; guenon (&quot;Cercopithecus preussii&quot;), and crowned guenon (&quot;Cercopithecus pogonias&quot;).

Two species of birds are endemic to Mount Cameroon, Mount Cameroon spurfowl (&quot;Pternistis camerunensis&quot;) and Mount Cameroon speirops (&quot;Zosterops melanocephalus&quot;).

==Mount Cameroon National Park==
 Mount Cameroon National Park (&quot;Parc National du Mont Cameroun&quot;) was created in 2009. It covers an area of . The park includes the former Etinde Forest Reserve and most of the Bomboko Forest Reserve. A portion of the Bomboko Forest Reserve remains outside the park, on the lower northern slopes of the mountain.
==IUGS geological heritage site==
In respect of it being &#x27;one of the few volcanoes in the world located at the ocean-continent boundary in a passive tectonic margin&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included &#x27;The Quaternary Cameroon Volcano&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

== Access ==
The peak is frequently ascended by hikers. The annual Mount Cameroon Race of Hope scales the peak in around 4½ hours. Sarah Etonge has won the race seven times and is also a tour operator. English explorer Mary Kingsley, one of the first Europeans to scale the mountain, recounts her expedition in her 1897 memoir &quot;Travels in West Africa&quot;.

<text>Mount Karisimbi a stratovolcano in the Virunga Mountains on the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. At , Karisimbi is the highest of the eight major mountains of the mountain range, which is a part of Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift. Karisimbi is flanked by Mikeno to the north, Bisoke to the east and Nyiragongo to the west, on the other side of the Rift Valley. Karisimbi is the 11th highest mountain of Africa.

The name Karisimbi comes from the word &#x27;amasimbi&#x27;, which means &quot;snow&quot; in the local Kinyarwanda language. Snow can mostly be found during the dry season in June, July and August on the top of the volcano.

Between Karisimbi and Bisoke is the Karisoke Research Center, which was founded by Dian Fossey in order to observe the mountain gorillas living in this area.

==History==
On February 27, 1908, an expedition led by Egon Von Kirschstein was coming down the Branca Crater when a hailstorm and snowstorm caused twenty of the expedition&#x27;s porters to perish.

In May 2010, a series of non-volcanic mudflows triggered by rain occurred along the volcano&#x27;s western flank. The mudflows carried volcanic rocks and vegetation debris downhill. At Kibiriga, the mudflows caused severe damage and killed at least 50 people.

<text>James Howell ( – ) was a Welsh writer and historian. The son of a Welsh clergyman, he was for much of his life in the shadow of his elder brother Thomas Howell, who became Lord Bishop of Bristol.

==Education==
In 1613 he gained his B.A. from Jesus College, Oxford – he was to be elected to a fellowship at Jesus College in 1623, but he was never formally admitted and his place was taken by another in 1626. Until he was 13, he was schooled in Hereford. He went to Oxford at the age of 19.

==Career==
After graduation, he had a variety of employments, as an administrator for a glass manufacturer, and in the often combined roles of secretary and instructor to several noble families. As factory agent and negotiator he traveled widely in Europe and learned to speak several languages, apparently with great facility. He also met and befriended numerous literary figures, among them Ben Jonson and Kenelm Digby. Paramount amongst his priorities was however royal, or at least aristocratic patronage.

On the eve of the English Civil War, he finally gained a secretaryship of the Privy Council, which according to one eminent critic, was &quot;very close to the type of appointment that he had sought for 20 years&quot;. The conflict meant that he never took up the position, and at about the same time, he wrote his first book, or &quot;maiden Fancy&quot;, &quot;Dodona&#x27;s Grove&quot;, which represented the history of England and Europe through the allegorical framework of a typology of trees. He started to publish at this time of ferment although he was already well established as a writer of what we would know today as &#x27;newsletters&#x27; but were then known as &#x27;tracts&#x27; or &#x27;pamphlets&#x27;.

He was a prolific writer, and he is among the first writers to earn his living solely from writing in the English language. He was also the first writer of an epistolary novel, a novel of letters, in English (&quot;Familiar Letters&quot;).

To lexicography Howell contributed his quadrilingual &quot;Lexicon Tetraglotton&quot; in 1660. This lexicon also contains a thematic dictionary in 52 sections, ranging from anatomy to cosmology. Howell&#x27;s &quot;Proverbs&quot;, although separately printed, was bound and sold with his &quot;Lexicon Tetraglotton&quot;. John Worthington, writing in his &quot;Diary&quot; in August 1661, recommended the separate republication of the &quot;Proverbs&quot; with its collection of British (i.e. Welsh) proverbs because the &quot;Lexicon&quot; itself &quot;is not so desirable&quot;. 

Howell was imprisoned in Fleet Prison in 1643, ostensibly as an insolvent debtor, although his political criticisms in &quot;Dodona&#x27;s Grove&quot; may have also played a part. Howell continued to write and publish from prison. He was released in 1651. He dedicated Some Sober Reflections (1656) to Cromwell, praising him for ending the Rump Parliament in 1653, obsequiously fawning over the Protector in the process, ending his dedication, &quot;I rest in the lowliest posture of obedience.&quot;

In 1650, Howell revised and expanded Cotgrave and Sherwood&#x27;s French and English dictionary of 1632, under the title &quot;A French-English Dictionary&quot;. He added a 21-page French grammar to the work in 1650, but the title page did not advertise this grammar until the 1660 edition; this grammar has often been mistakenly cited as a separate publication.

He wrote &quot;A New English Grammar&quot; with notes on travel in Spain and Portugal &quot;for the service of Her Majesty&quot;. 

Some modern historians of formal English consider Howell&#x27;s &quot;New English Grammar&quot; a work of foreign language teaching and the first work of its kind in the English language.

Howell&#x27;s &quot;Proverbs&quot; contains the famous saying: &quot;All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy&quot;.

<doc id="515436" wikidata="Q906754" url="?curid=515436" title="McFlurry">
<text>The McFlurry is a brand-name of frozen soft serve dessert produced and sold by American-based multinational fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s. It is served in a cup, with additional mixed-in ingredients such as candy and cookie fragments and sweet topping sauces. It was created in 1995 by Ron McLellan, a Canadian McDonald&#x27;s franchise owner in Bathurst, New Brunswick, and later introduced to the United States in 1997.

== History ==
The McFlurry was created by Canadian McDonald&#x27;s franchisee Ron McLellan in Bathurst, New Brunswick, in 1995. The first McFlurry, which was Oreo-flavored, was sold on June 7, 1995. After proving successful in Bathurst, McDonalds began offering the McFlurry at a number of Toronto locations. In the U.S., the McFlurry was test-marketed in select regions in 1997. By March 1998, the product was available to all American and Canadian locations and has been gradually introduced in various other locations since then.

Until September 2006, the McFlurry was served with a container lid having an opening that was of a size that caused some animals to become trapped with their head stuck inside the discarded containers. An outcry in the UK, particularly to protect European hedgehogs, caused a redesign in the container shape. After &quot;significant research and design testing&quot;, the company addressed the problem in 2006 by reducing the size of the opening to prevent entry of an animal&#x27;s head. In June 2019, McDonald&#x27;s announced it planned to stop using lids on McFlurrys in the United Kingdom by September 2019, as part of a move to reduce the use of single-use plastics by the chain. However, lids with circular openings are still being used in some other markets as of September 2023.

&quot;30 Rock&quot; prominently featured the McFlurry in the plot of its season 3 episode 11, &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;. Although some commenters interpreted the prominence of the product in the episode as heavy-handed product placement, it was later reported that McDonald&#x27;s had not paid to have it featured, and the show&#x27;s producers were even worried that McDonald&#x27;s might sue them for featuring it without authorization.

== Preparation ==

The McFlurry consists of whipped, soft serve McDonald&#x27;s vanilla-flavored ice cream in a cup. The McFlurry has a specially designed spoon with a hole in the handle which is attached to a blender. Various types of candy or cookies are added to the cup, which are then blended into the ice cream using the spoon. McFlurry flavors vary from market to market, and new flavors are introduced regularly.

The ice cream in a McFlurry is the same that McDonald&#x27;s uses for its cones and sundaes. The ice cream is made from ultra-high-temperature (UHT) pasteurized milk, extended with methylcellulose. CNBC reported that, from late 2016, McDonald&#x27;s started phasing out artificial flavors from its vanilla ice cream. The change was part of an effort to recover the more than 500 million customer visits it had lost since 2012.

== Reviews ==
Despite referring to the McFlurry as &quot;a quick-serve medley of gelatinous, innocuous ice cream that some reviewers might consider closer to caulk than dairy&quot;, Wil Fulton and Kat Thompson of Thrillist described the M&amp;M McFlurry as &quot;the epitome of low stakes, drive-thru fun&quot;, placing it at the end of their list of the 13 Best Fast Food Desserts. Dan Myers of The Daily Meal included the Oreo McFlurry in its (unranked) list of 10 Best Fast Food Desserts, saying &quot;You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to encounter anyone who isn&#x27;t a fan of this sweet treat.&quot;

<doc id="515437" wikidata="Q3310654" url="?curid=515437" title="Insertion device">
<text>An insertion device (ID) is a component in modern synchrotron light sources, so called because they are &quot;inserted&quot; into accelerator tracks. They are periodic magnetic structures that stimulate highly brilliant, forward-directed synchrotron radiation emission by forcing a stored charged particle beam to perform wiggles, or undulations, as they pass through the device. This motion is caused by the Lorentz force, and it is from this oscillatory motion that we get the names for the two classes of device, which are known as wigglers and undulators.
As well as creating a brighter light, some insertion devices enable tuning of the light so that different frequencies can be generated for different applications.

==History==
The theory behind undulators was developed by Vitaly Ginzburg in the USSR. However it was Motz and his team who in 1953 installed the first undulator in a linac at Stanford, using it to generate millimetre wave radiation through to visible light.

It was not until the 1970s that undulators were installed in electron storage rings to produce synchrotron radiation. The first institutions to take these devices were the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow, and the Tomsk Polytechnic University. These installations allowed a fuller characterisation of the behaviour of undulators.

Undulators only became practical devices for insertion in synchrotron light sources in 1981, when teams at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), and at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) in Russia developed permanent magnetic arrays, known as Halbach arrays, which allowed short repeating periods unachievable with either electromagnetic coils or superconducting coils.

Despite their similar function, wigglers were used in storage rings for over a decade before they were used to generate synchrotron radiation for beamlines. Wigglers have a damping effect on storage rings, which is the function to which they first put at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator in Massachusetts in 1966. The first wiggler used for generation of synchrotron radiation was a 7 pole wiggler installed in the SSRL in 1979.

Since these first insertions the number of undulators and wigglers in synchrotron radiation facilities throughout the world have proliferated and they are one of the driving technologies behind the next generation of light sources, free electron lasers.
==Operation==
Insertion devices are traditionally inserted into straight sections of storage rings (hence their name). As the stored particle beam, usually electrons, pass through the ID the alternating magnetic field experienced by the particles causes their trajectory to undergo a transverse oscillation. The acceleration associated with this movement stimulates the emission of synchrotron radiation.

There is very little mechanical difference between wigglers and undulators and the criterion normally used to distinguish between them is the K-Factor. The K-factor is a dimensionless constant defined as:

formula_1

where &quot;q&quot; is the charge of the particle passing through the ID, &quot;B&quot; is the peak magnetic field of the ID, &quot;formula_2&quot; is the period of the ID, &quot;formula_3&quot; relates to the speed, or energy of the particle, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the accelerated particle, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

Wigglers are deemed to have K»1 and undulators to have K&lt;1.

The K-Factor determines the energy of radiation produced, and in situations where a range of energy is required the K-number can be modified by varying the strength of the magnetic field of the device. In permanent magnet devices this is usually done by increasing the gap between the magnet arrays. In electromagnetic devices the magnetic field is changed by varying the current in the magnet coils.

In a wiggler the period and the strength of the magnetic field is not tuned to the frequency of radiation produced by the electrons. Thus every electron in a bunch radiates independently, and the resulting radiation bandwidth is broad. A wiggler can be considered to be series of bending magnets concatenated together, and its radiation intensity scales as the number of magnetic poles in the wiggler.

In an undulator source the radiation produced by the oscillating electrons interferes constructively with the motion of other electrons, causing the radiation spectrum to have a relatively narrow bandwidth. The intensity of radiation scales as formula_4, where formula_5 is the number of poles in the magnet array.

The wavelength formula_6 of the radiation emitted by an insertion device can be calculated using the &quot;undulator equation&quot;:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the Lorentz factor, formula_2 the undulation period, &quot;K&quot; the K-factor as described above, and formula_10 the angle measured from the center of the radiated lobe. 

Despite its name the equation holds true for both undulators and wigglers.

<text>Dendrologia: Dodona&#x27;s Grove, or the Vocal Forest was a poem by James Howell published in 1640, which launched Howell&#x27;s literary career. It was published in English in multiple editions and was translated into French and Latin.

== Description ==

&quot;Dodona&#x27;s Grove&quot; is an allegory of Europe, particularly England, depicting events between 1603 and 1640. Dodona, in the title, refers to the ancient Hellenic oracle of Zeus in Epirus.

Covered in the poem are the Spanish match, the Gunpowder Plot, the murder of Thomas Overbury, and the assassination of Buckingham. The political criticisms in &quot;Dodona&#x27;s Grove&quot; may have contributed to Howell&#x27;s imprisonment in 1643.

In the poem, plants represent prominent persons. The British oak tree in &quot;Dodona&#x27;s Grove&quot; represents the Stuarts.

== Impact ==

Historian Henry Hallam criticized the work harshly, calling it &quot;clumsy&quot;, &quot;unintelligible&quot;, &quot;dull&quot;, and &quot;an entire failure&quot;. Despite its shortcomings, it is speculated to have been an influence on James Harrington&#x27;s &quot;The Commonwealth of Oceana&quot;. Bibliographer Albrecht von Haller was tricked into including &quot;Dodona&#x27;s Grove&quot; in his &quot;Bibliotheca Botanica&quot;.

<text>Maurice Morning Wills (October 2, 1932 – September 19, 2022) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from 1959 to 1972, most prominently as an integral member of the Los Angeles Dodgers teams that won three World Series titles between and . He also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Montreal Expos. Wills is credited with reviving the stolen base as part of baseball strategy.

Wills was the National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1962, stealing a record 104 bases to break the old modern era mark of 96, set by Ty Cobb in 1915. He was an All-Star for five seasons and seven All-Star Games, and was the first MLB All-Star Game Most Valuable Player in 1962. He also won Gold Gloves in 1961 and 1962. In a fourteen-year career, Wills batted .281 with 20 home runs, 458 runs batted in, 2,134 hits, 1,067 runs, 177 doubles, 71 triples, 586 stolen bases, and 552 bases on balls in 1,942 games. From 2009 until his death in 2022, Wills was a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, serving as a representative of the Dodgers Legend Bureau.

==Early life==
Wills was born in Washington, D.C., to Guy and Mabel Wills, the seventh of thirteen children. His parents were originally from Maryland; his father, born in 1900, worked as a machinist at the Washington Navy Yard and was a part-time Baptist minister. His mother, born in 1902, worked as an elevator operator.

He began playing semi-professional baseball at age 14. At Cardozo Senior High School, Wills starred in baseball, basketball, and football. He earned All-City honors in each sport in his sophomore, junior, and senior years. On the baseball team, he played third base and also pitched.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Wills signed with the then-Brooklyn Dodgers in 1950, after graduating from high school. He spent eight years in the minor leagues for them. Before the 1959 season, the Detroit Tigers bought his contract for $35,000, but they returned Wills to the Dodgers after spring training because they did not think he was worth that salary.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Pee Wee Reese, the Dodgers&#x27; shortstop, retired after the 1958 season. The Dodgers began the 1959 season with Bob Lillis at shortstop, but he struggled and the team went to Don Zimmer. When Zimmer broke his toe in June, the Dodgers promoted Wills from the minor leagues. He played in 83 games for the Dodgers, batting .260 with 7 RBI. In the 1959 World Series, he played in each of the six games, hitting 5-for-20 with one stolen base and two runs in the Dodgers&#x27; victory. Before the 1960 season, the Dodgers traded Zimmer. In Wills&#x27;s first full season in 1960, he hit .295 with 27 RBI and a league-leading 50 stolen bases in 148 games, becoming the first National League (NL) player to steal 50 bases since Max Carey stole 51 in 1923.

In , Wills stole 104 bases to set a new MLB stolen base record, breaking the old modern era mark of 96, set by Ty Cobb in 1915. Wills also stole more bases than any team that year, the highest total being 99 by the Washington Senators. Wills was caught stealing just 13 times. He finished the season batting .299 with six home runs and 48 RBI, and led the NL with 10 triples and 179 singles. Late in the 1962 season, San Francisco Giants Manager Alvin Dark ordered grounds crews to water down the base paths, turning them into mud to hinder Wills&#x27;s base-stealing attempts. In 1962, Wills played a full 162-game schedule, plus all three games of the best-of-three regular season playoff series with the Giants, giving him a total of 165 games played, an MLB record that still stands for most games played in a single season. His 104 steals remained a major league record until Lou Brock stole 118 in 1974. He won the NL Most Valuable Player Award over Willie Mays, with teammate Tommy Davis finishing third.
In the 1963 World Series, Wills batted 2-for-16 (.133) with one stolen base in the Dodgers&#x27; four-game sweep of the New York Yankees. In the 1965 World Series, he played in all seven games and went 11-for-30 (.367) with three runs and three stolen bases in a hard-fought Dodger victory, his third and last World Series title.

While playing for the Dodgers, Wills was a Gold Glove Award winner in 1961 and 1962, was named a NL All-Star five times (5 seasons), and was selected seven times for the All-Star Game (two games were played in 1961 and 1962).

In the 1966 season, Wills had 38 stolen bases and was caught stealing 24 times. He batted 1-for-13, an .077 average, with one stolen base, in the 1966 World Series, as the Dodgers were swept in four games.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
After the 1966 season, the Dodgers went on a postseason exhibition tour of Japan. During the tour, Wills, who was nursing bad knees and felt he was unable to perform, left in the middle and went back home. His leaving was seen as abandonment and disloyalty by Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley who was already irked at losing pitcher Sandy Koufax who had recently retired. Hence, almost as a punishment, the team traded Wills to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Bob Bailey and Gene Michael.

In the 1967 season, he played in 149 games, recording 186 hits, 29 stolen bases (his lowest since having 35 in 1961), three home runs, 45 RBI, and a .302 batting average. In the following season, he played in 153 games, getting 174 hits, 31 RBI, and 52 stolen bases, although he was caught stealing 21 times, with a .278 batting average.

===Montreal Expos===
On October 14, 1968, the Montreal Expos selected Wills from the Pirates as the 21st pick in the expansion draft. Wills batted first in the lineup for the inaugural game of the Expos on April 8, 1969. He went 3-for-6 with one RBI and one stolen base in the 11–10 win. He played just 47 games for the team, getting 42 hits, 8 RBI and 15 stolen bases on a .222 batting average. An exchange with Ted Blackman of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; on May 19 made headlines when Wills struck Blackman in the mouth due to not liking what Blackman had put in the paper, and loose play by Wills later that month led to boos in Montreal. Unhappy in Montreal, Wills briefly retired on June 3 but returned to the Expos 48 hours later.

===Back to the Dodgers===
On June 11, 1969, the Expos traded Wills to the Dodgers along with Manny Mota for Ron Fairly and Paul Popovich. In 104 games with Los Angeles, he batted .297 with four home runs and 39 RBI while stealing 25 bases. After the season, Wills finished 11th in NL MVP voting. In the following year, he played in 132 games while having 141 hits, 34 RBI 28 stolen bases, and a .270 batting average. For 1971, he played in 149 games while having 169 hits, three home runs, 44 RBI, 15 stolen bases, and a .281 batting average, resulting in a sixth-place finish in NL MVP voting. However, Wills failed to work out during the 1972 Major League Baseball strike, and once the season finally started, he struggled with his reflexes and timing. After a game against the Expos in which he struggled against Carl Morton, Wills went back to the bench, nodded at manager Walter Alston, and remarked, &quot;He&#x27;s certainly justified if he takes me out.&quot; Alston did indeed replace Wills in the lineup with Bill Russell on April 29, and Wills spent the rest of the season as a reserve player while Russell went on to hold the position for the next several years.

Wills played 71 games in 1972, recording 17 hits, 4 RBI and one stolen base and a .129 batting average. In his final MLB appearance on October 4, 1972, he served as a pinch runner for Ron Cey in the top of the ninth inning, scoring a run on a home run by Steve Yeager while also playing the bottom of the ninth inning at third base. On October 24, 1972, he was released by the Dodgers.

===Base stealing===
Alongside Chicago White Sox shortstop Luis Aparicio (who led the American League in stolen bases in nine straight years), Wills brought new prominence to the tactic of stolen bases. &quot;Almost single-handedly Maury turned baseball from its love affair with plodding, one-dimensional sluggers and got the game to consider pure speed as serious offensive and defensive weapons,&quot; noted Tommy John. Perhaps it was due to greater media exposure in Los Angeles, or to the Dodgers&#x27; greater success, or to their extreme reliance on a low-scoring strategy that emphasized pitching, defense, and Wills&#x27;s speed to compensate for their lack of productive hitters. Wills was a significant distraction to the pitcher even if he did not try to steal, because he was a constant threat to do so. The fans at Dodger Stadium would chant, &quot;Go! Go! Go, Maury, Go!&quot; any time he got on base. While not the fastest runner in the major leagues, Wills accelerated with remarkable speed. He also studied pitchers relentlessly, watching their pick-off moves even when not on base. And when driven back to the bag, his fierce competitiveness made him determined to steal. Once, when on first base against New York Mets pitcher Roger Craig, Wills drew twelve consecutive throws from Craig to the Mets first baseman. On Craig&#x27;s next pitch to the plate, Wills stole second.

In the wake of his record-breaking season, Wills&#x27;s stolen base totals dropped precipitously. Though he continued to frighten pitchers once on base, he stole only 40 bases in 1963 and 53 bases in 1964. In July 1965, Wills was ahead of his 1962 pace. However, at age 32, Wills began to slow in the second half. The punishment of sliding led him to bandage his legs before every game, and he ended the 1965 season with 94 stolen bases.

==Managing and retirement==

After retiring from playing professional baseball, Wills spent time as a baseball analyst at NBC from 1973 through 1977. He also managed in the Mexican Pacific League—a winter league—for four seasons, during which time he led the Naranjeros de Hermosillo to the 1970–71 season league championship. Wills let it be known he felt qualified to pilot a big-league club. In his book, &quot;How To Steal A Pennant&quot;, Wills claimed he could take any last-place club and make them champions within four years. The San Francisco Giants allegedly offered him a one-year deal, but Wills turned them down. In August 1980, the Seattle Mariners fired Darrell Johnson and named Wills their manager.

According to the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;″s Steve Rudman, Wills made a number of gaffes. He called for a relief pitcher although there was nobody warming up in the bullpen, held up another game for 10 minutes while looking for a pinch-hitter, and even left a spring-training game in the sixth inning to fly to California.

On April 25, 1981, Wills ordered the Mariners&#x27; grounds crew to make the batter&#x27;s boxes one foot longer than regulation, after receiving complaints that Tom Paciorek was batting outside the box. The extra foot was in the direction of the mound. However, Oakland Athletics manager Billy Martin noticed something was amiss and asked plate umpire Bill Kunkel to investigate. Under questioning from Kunkel, the Mariners&#x27; head groundskeeper admitted Wills had ordered the change. Wills claimed he was trying to help his players stay in the box. However, Martin suspected that given the large number of breaking ball pitchers on the A&#x27;s staff, Wills wanted to give his players an advantage. The American League suspended Wills for two games and fined him $500. American League umpiring supervisor Dick Butler likened Wills&#x27;s actions to decreasing the distance between the bases from to .

After leading Seattle to a 20–38 mark to end the 1980 season, new owner George Argyros fired Wills on May 6, 1981, with the Mariners deep in last place at 6–18. His career record was 26–56, for a winning percentage of .317, one of the worst ever for a non-interim manager.
However, Julio Cruz, himself an accomplished base stealer, credited Wills with teaching him how to steal second base against a left-handed pitcher. Dave Roberts similarly credits Wills with coaching him to steal under pressure circumstances, particularly his crucial stolen base in Game 4 of the 2004 American League Championship Series. &quot;He said, &#x27;DR, one of these days you&#x27;re going to have to steal an important base when everyone in the ballpark knows you&#x27;re gonna steal, but you&#x27;ve got to steal that base and you can&#x27;t be afraid to steal that base.&#x27; So, just kind of trotting out on to the field that night, I was thinking about him. So he was on one side telling me &#x27;this was your opportunity.&#x27; And the other side of my brain is saying, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to get thrown out, don&#x27;t get thrown out.&#x27; Fortunately Maury&#x27;s voice won out in my head.&quot;

Wills was a coach on the team from 1996 to 1997 and served as a radio color commentator for the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks on KNFL until 2017. He resumed making appearances with the Dodgers in 2000, serving as a guest instructor in spring training until 2016.

== Hall of Fame candidacy ==
As a BBWAA candidate, Wills was on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot for fifteen years, from 1978 to 1992, but never received more than 40.6% of the vote, falling far short of the required 75% to be elected. His vote total fell to half after 1982 and his subsequent arrest in 1983 for cocaine possession likely played a part in why his numbers never recovered.

In 2014, Wills appeared for the first time as a candidate on the Golden Era Committee election ballot for Hall of Fame induction in 2015, which required twelve votes. However, he missed getting elected by three votes. All the other candidates on the ballot also missed being elected.

The Golden Era Committee was replaced in 2016 by the four committees, including Golden Days Committee which covered the period from 1950 to 1969. Wills was on the 2022 ballot but he did not receive enough votes for induction.

==Entertainment career==
Throughout most of his major league playing career, Wills supplemented his salary in the off-season by performing extensively as a vocalist and instrumentalist (on banjo, guitar, and ukulele), appearing occasionally on television and frequently in night clubs. He also cut at least two records during this period—one under his own name, the other as featured vocalist with Lionel Hampton. For roughly two years, starting on October 24, 1968, Wills was the co-owner, operator, and featured performer of a nightclub, The Stolen Base (also known as Maury Wills&#x27; Stolen Base), located in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Golden Triangle and offering a mix of &quot;banjos, draft beer and baseball.&quot;

By no account, least of all his own, was Wills a consummate virtuoso; &quot;good; not great, maybe, but good,&quot; wrote &quot;Newsday&#x27;s&quot; Stan Isaacs, reviewing a 1966 Basin Street East engagement shared with World Series nemesis Mudcat Grant (although Isaacs did single out &quot;a few mean choruses on banjo&quot;). Nonetheless, the level of proficiency attained on Wills&#x27;s principal instrument was attested to on two separate occasions by the American Federation of Musicians: first, in December 1962, when the president of Los Angeles Local 47, after hearing just a few minutes of banjo playing, promptly waived the balance of Wills&#x27;s membership entrance exam, and then, just over five years later, when trumpeter Charlie Teagarden, specifically citing &quot;Maury&#x27;s banjo-playing ability&quot; (and evidently unaware of Wills&#x27;s already established membership), &quot;presented him, on behalf of the musicians union, an honorary lifetime membership.&quot;

In 1969, Wills appeared in an episode of the television series &quot;Get Smart&quot;, entitled &quot;Apes of Wrath&quot; (season 5, episode 10).

In 1965, Wills recorded two songs for the album &quot;The Sound Of The Dodgers&quot;: &quot;Dodger Stadium&quot; (with teammate Willie Davis and comedian Stubby Kaye) and &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Keeping Score&quot;.

==Personal life==
After receiving the Hickok Belt in 1962, Wills was determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to have deficiencies in reported income and awards deductions. The United States Tax Court supported the Commissioner and the tax case was brought up to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the decision.

In his 1992 autobiography, &quot;On the Run: The Never Dull and Often Shocking Life of Maury Wills&quot;, Wills discussed his love affair with actress Doris Day. Day had previously denied this in her 1976 autobiography &quot;Doris Day: Her Own Story&quot;.

Wills abused alcohol and cocaine until 1989. He wrote in his autobiography, &quot;In years, I spent more than $1 million of my own money on cocaine.&quot; In December 1983, Wills was arrested for cocaine possession after his former girlfriend, Judy Aldrich, had reported her car stolen. During a search of the car, police found a vial allegedly containing .06 grams of cocaine and a water pipe. The charge was dismissed three months later on the grounds of insufficient evidence. The Dodgers organization paid for a drug treatment program, but Wills walked out and continued to use drugs until he began a relationship with Angela George, who encouraged him to begin a vitamin therapy program. The two later married.

Wills is the father of former major leaguer Bump Wills, who played for the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs for six seasons. Due to a salacious anecdote in the elder Wills&#x27;s autobiography, the two had a falling out, but as of 2004 occasionally spoke.

In 2009, Wills was honored by Washington, D.C., and Cardozo Senior High School with the renaming of the former Banneker Recreation Field as Maury Wills Field. The field was completely renovated and serves as Cardozo&#x27;s home diamond. The Maury Wills Museum in Fargo, North Dakota, at Newman Outdoor Field, home of the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, opened in 2001 and closed in 2017 when he retired.

Wills died at his home in Sedona, Arizona, on September 19, 2022, at age 89, just two weeks shy of his 90th birthday.

==The stolen base &quot;asterisk&quot;==
While Wills had broken Cobb&#x27;s single season stolen base record in 1962, the National League had increased its number of games played per team that year from 154 to 162. Wills&#x27;s 97th stolen base occurred after his team had played its 154th game; as a result, Commissioner Ford Frick ruled that Wills&#x27;s 104-steal season and Cobb&#x27;s 96-steal season of 1915 were separate records, just as he had the year before (the American League had also increased its number of games played per team to 162) after Roger Maris had broken Babe Ruth&#x27;s single-season home run record. Both stolen base records were broken in 1974 by Lou Brock&#x27;s 118 steals; Brock broke Cobb&#x27;s stolen base record by stealing his 97th base before his St. Louis Cardinals completed their 154th game.

<text>Singanalluru Puttaswamaiah Muthuraj (24 April 1929 – 12 April 2006), better known by his stage name Dr. Rajkumar, was an Indian actor and singer who worked in Kannada cinema. Regarded as one of the greatest and versatile actors in the history of Indian cinema, he is considered a cultural icon and holds a matinée idol status in the Kannada diaspora, among whom he is popularly called as &quot;Nata Saarvabhouma&quot; (Emperor of Actors), &quot;Bangarada Manushya&quot; (Man of Gold), &quot;Vara Nata&quot; (Gifted actor), &quot;Gaana Gandharva&quot; (Celestial singer), &quot;Rasikara Raja&quot; (King of connoisseurs), &quot;Kannada Kanteerava&quot; and &quot;Rajanna&quot;/&quot;Annavru&quot; (Elder brother, Raj).

A mega icon and a socio-cultural symbol of Kannada, he has been credited with redefining Kannada cinema and also putting the Kannada cinema on the national map. He was the first actor to play the lead role in 100 as well as 200 Kannada movies. His 1986 movie &quot;Anuraga Aralithu&quot; was the first Indian movie to be remade in seven other languages.

==Early life==
Singanalluru Puttaswamaiah Muthuraj was born on 24 April 1929 in Dodda Gajanur, a hamlet in the Talavady taluk. His father Puttaswamayya and mother Lakshmamma were impoverished theatre artists from Singanalluru. His mother tongue was Kannada. Puttaswamayya was good at playing mythological roles such as Kamsa, Ravana, and Hiranyakashipu. Muthuraj left school at eight and was later discovered by film producers, who cast him in small roles that he played till he was 25.

He was named Muthuraj, after Muthaththi Raya (a name for the Hindu deity Hanuman), which is a temple deity located in Muthathi, a settlement on the banks of river Kaveri in Malavalli taluk, Mandya District of Karnataka.

==Career==

===As actor===
Muthuraj started his acting career with his father in a drama troupe led by Gubbi Veeranna and later joined the drama company of Subbaiah Naidu. In 1953, he was spotted by film director H. L. N. Simha, who was on the lookout for well-built, pleasant-faced man for the starring role in film, &quot;Bedara Kannappa&quot; (1954). Simha eventually signed Muthuraj for the film and named him Rajkumar.

Prior to &quot;Bedara Kannappa&quot;, Rajkumar had appeared as a child artist in the 1942 film &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot; in a small role and also in the 1952 film, &quot;Sri Srinivasa Kalyana&quot;, as Sage Agasthya, one of the Saptarishis (seven sages). It was an insignificant role in which his scene was over even before he recognised himself.

He acted only in Kannada movies throughout his career apart from one Telugu film, &quot;Kalahasti Mahatyam&quot; (1954), which was a remake of his debut Kannada movie &quot;Bedara Kannappa&quot;.

He had lead roles in 205 movies. He owned a production company called &quot;Sri Vajreshwari Combines&quot; under the banner &quot;Dakshayani Combines&quot;. &quot;Bhagyada Bagilu&quot; (1968) was his 100th film, &quot;Devatha Manushya&quot; (1988) was his 200th film and &quot;Shabdavedhi&quot; (2000) was his last film.

His historical movies such as &quot;Ranadheera Kanteerava&quot;, &quot;Immadi Pulikeshi&quot;, &quot;Sri Krishnadevaraya&quot; and &quot;Mayura&quot; presented a populist version of Karnataka&#x27;s history, focusing on the Karnataka kingdoms such as Mysore royalty, The Chalukyas, Vijayanagara Empire and The Kadambas respectively - thereby making him the only Indian actor to have portrayed the role of four prominent kings of Indian history - Kanthirava Narasaraja I, Pulakeshin II, Krishnadevaraya and Mayurasharma. He also appeared as Bijjala II in &quot;Jagajyothi Basveshwara&quot; and as Raja Mallasarja in &quot;Kittur Chennamma&quot;.

He also has the rare distinction of having portrayed the mythological roles of both &quot;Devas&quot; and &quot;Asuras&quot; in an almost equal number on the Indian on-screen. While he has played Lord Ram in &quot;Sri Ramanjaneya Yuddha&quot;, Lord Vishnu in &quot;Sri Srinivasa Kalyana&quot;, &quot;Lord Krishna&quot; in &quot;Sri Krishna Rukmini Satyabhama&quot;, Lord Shiva in &quot;Gange Gowri&quot;, Narada in &quot;Mooroovare Vajragalu&quot;, he has also played the role of Ravana in &quot;Bhookailasa&quot;, Hiranyakashipu in &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot;, Shishupala in &quot;Dashavathara&quot;, Bhasmasura in &quot;Mohini Bhasmasura&quot; and Mahishasura in &quot;Mahishasura Mardini&quot;. His other prominent mythological characters include Kannappa in &quot;Bedara Kannappa&quot;, Chandrahasa in &quot;Chandrahasa&quot;, Harishchandra in &quot;Satya Harishchandra&quot;, Satyavan in &quot;Sathi Savithri&quot;, Vasishtha in &quot;Mahasathi Arundathi&quot;, Valmiki in &quot;Valmiki&quot;, Chyavana Maharshi in &quot;Sathi Sukanya&quot; and Dushyanta in &quot;Kaviratna Kalidasa&quot;.

His movies also have dream and song sequences where he appears in various characters such as Kamadeva in &quot;Dhruva Thare&quot;, as Krishna in &quot;Emme Thammanna&quot;, &quot;Daari Tappida Maga&quot; and &quot;Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma&quot;.

He has acted in around 50 movies based on novels, plays and short stories, which is the highest for any actor in India. He made movies from Kannada novels and made movies against perceived social evils in movies like &quot;Jeevana Chaitra&quot; (on evils of alcohol) and &quot;Shabdavedhi&quot; (on drug abuse).

Between 1954 and 1969, Kannada film industry produced 207 movies within a span of 15 years and Rajkumar starred in 100 of those.

When Rajkumar appeared as CID 999 in &quot;Jedara Bale&quot;, he became the first Indian actor to enact a spy role modelled on James Bond in a full-fledged manner and was called the &quot;James Bond of India&quot;. The success of this movie led to three sequels: &quot;Goa Dalli CID 999&quot;, &quot;Operation Jackpot Nalli C.I.D 999&quot; and &quot;Operation Diamond Racket&quot;. The &quot;CID 999 Franchise&quot; was the first Indian movie franchise to have four instalments and CID 999 was the first character based trilogy in India.

He acted with heroines of southern cinema such as Jayanti (38 films), Pandaribai (18 films), Leelavathi (28 films), Bharati (26 films), Kalpana (19 films), Aarathi (13 films), B.

His movie &quot;Ondu Muttina Kathe&quot; was reported to be the first ever Indian film to have an underwater action sequence shot in an ocean outside India without the help of oxygen mask.

Rajkumar&#x27;s 1971 movie &quot;Kasturi Nivasa&quot; was colorised and released in 2014. Even close to a decade after his death, the movie garnered a grand opening with the actor&#x27;s life-size cutout being immersed in milk. The colorised release also performed well at the box office over taking other Kannada movies released at the time. His 39 movies have been remade 63 times in 9 languages by 34 actors.

===As singer===
Rajkumar trained in classical music when he was with Gubbi Veeranna&#x27;s theatre troupe. The track &quot;Om Namaha Shivaya&quot; from the 1956 film &quot;Ohileshwara&quot;, which he also starred in, was his first song for a film. He subsequently sang &quot;Thumbithu Manava&quot;, a duet with S. Janaki, for the movie &quot;Mahishasura Mardini&quot; (1959). However, he became a full-fledged singer only in 1974 when he sang in place of P. B. Sreenivas for &quot;Sampathige Savaal&quot;, who had till then sung for most songs picturised on Rajkumar, fell ill. Rajkumar sang the energetic &quot;Yaare Koogadali&quot; for the film which became widely popular during the time and is considered one of his best songs.

Rajkumar has been credited for having sung across various genres and each rendition according to the mood of the scene in the film. In &quot;Yaaru Tiliyaru Ninna&quot; for &quot;Babruvahana&quot; (1977), a prosodic form of Kannada poetry that required the tone to be a combination of sarcasm and anger, he blended the twin skills of theatrics and music. For &quot;Nee Nanna Gellalare&quot; (1981), he sang two songs—&quot;Jeeva Hoovagide&quot; and &quot;Anuraga Enaytu&quot;—beginning both with the refrain &quot;I love you&quot;, that is full of Carnatic gamakas. After the same tone in the refrain, they take on a life of their own with the form according to love and happiness in the former and love but a discord in the latter. He is known widely for his rendition of &quot;Nadamaya&quot; for &quot;Jeevana Chaitra&quot; (1992), a song based on the raga of Todi and with complex graces and strings other ragas as it progresses. He switches ragas with ease, and sings complex swara patterns like a professional classical artiste. For the rendition, he was awarded the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer. His frequent collaboration with the composer duo of Rajan–Nagendra gave musical hits such as &quot;Bangarada Hoovu&quot; (1967), &quot;Nyayave Devaru&quot; (1971), &quot;Swayamvara&quot; (1973), &quot;Sri Srinivasa Kalyana&quot; (1974), &quot;Nanobba Kalla&quot; (1979) and &quot;Chalisuva Modagalu&quot; (1982).

Rajkumar&#x27;s duets are mostly recorded with S. Janaki and Vani Jairam. Other female singers who sang with him are P. Susheela, Bangalore Latha, H. P. Geetha, K. S. Chitra, Swarnalatha, Manjula Gururaj, B. R. Chaya, Kasturi Shankar, Rathnamala Prakash, Sulochana and others.

During his career, Rajkumar sang and performed for songs about Kannadigas, the Kannada language and culture, such as &quot;Jenina Holeyo&quot; from &quot;Chalisuva Modagalu&quot;, &quot;Maanavanagi Huttidmele&quot; from &quot;Jeevana Chaitra&quot; and &quot;Huttidare Kannada&quot; from the film &quot;Aakasmika&quot;. He sang a complete English song called &quot;If You Come Today&quot; (&quot;Tick Tick Tick&quot;) in the movie &quot;Operation Diamond Racket&quot; in 1978. This song became an internet meme in India following Rajkumar&#x27;s demise in 2006.

In later years, he lent his voice to a few actors and sang background solos. For the song &quot;Deepavali Deepavali &quot; from &quot;Muddina Maava&quot;, he provided playback to S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. This was a rare occasion. &quot;Hrudaya Samudra Kalaki&quot; from &quot;Ashwamedha&quot; and &quot;Hey Dinakara&quot; from &quot;Om&quot; are the two other popular songs sung by Rajkumar for other actors. He also sang Kalidasa shlokas such as &quot;Maanikya Veena&quot; and ghazal-based songs such as &quot;Sadaa Kannale&quot;, &quot;Kanneera Dhaare&quot; and &quot;Yaava Kaviyu&quot;.

Rajkumar recorded many devotional songs beginning in the 1970s for Columbia Recording Company starting with &quot;Mantralayakke Hogona&quot; in 1972. His widely popular LP record &quot;Guruvara Bantamma&quot; was also recorded during the time. In 1979, Sangeetha Cassettes became India&#x27;s first licensed pre-recorded cassettes. Rajkumar sang the devotional songs glorifying the saint Raghavendra and the Hindu deity Hanuman.

Apart from performing in about 75 musical nights, he has sung 300 movie songs and about 200 folk and devotional songs, the proceeds of which were given away to charity.

It was also noted that his versatility and diction contributed immensely to his popularity as a singer since he was able to sing songs of any style - be it qawwali, ghazal, bhajan or English songs - apart from handling a range of emotions - vivacious, romance, devotion or sarcasm.

==Personal life==
===Family===
At the age of 24, Rajkumar married his 14-year-old cousin, Parvathamma, on 25 June 1953 in Nanjangud. This was in accordance with the betrothal that their fathers made following the latter&#x27;s birth. Together, they had five children: sons Shiva, Raghavendra and Puneeth, and daughters Lakshmi and Poornima. Having lived a &quot;hand to mouth existence&quot; after marriage in a joint family that included 24 children in Madras, the family moved to Bangalore in 1972, after Rajkumar began getting multiple film offers.

== Abduction ==

On 30 July 2000, Rajkumar, his son-in-law Govindaraju and two others were abducted by Veerappan from the actor&#x27;s palatial house at Gajanur. Veerappan demanded the release of his gang members who were being held in jail under a defunct anti-terrorism law. The event prompted a massive manhunt and threw the Karnataka government into crisis. The Supreme Court of India opined that it was &quot;unpardonable&quot; on the part of the government of Tamil Nadu for not providing security to Rajkumar, although they had information a year earlier that he faced a threat of being kidnapped by Veerappan. A Special Task Force (STF) set up to capture Veerapan had earlier warned Rajkumar against visiting the farmhouse, and his son Raghavendra later acknowledged that his father had not taken the threat seriously.

After a total of 108 days in captivity, Rajkumar was released unharmed on 15 November 2000. His abduction and the manner in which his release was secured remains a mystery.

== Death and memorial ==

On 12 April 2006, Rajkumar returned to his Sadashivanagar residence after his regular 20-minute walk and had a general medical check-up by 11:30 a.m. (IST). At 1:50 pm (IST), as he sat on a sofa, he asked a member of his family to slow the fan down and immediately collapsed. His personal physician Ramana Rao was called for, who rushed within three minutes, and performed external cardiac massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Rajkumar was then taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and was administered intracardiac injections. Efforts to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead at 2:05 pm (IST). His death occurred 12 days before his 77th birthday. His eyes were donated to two visually impaired persons the same day.

Rajkumar&#x27;s death triggered an outpouring of grief. There was major shutdown in the city of Bengaluru. An unofficial &quot;bandh&quot; (closure of all shops and other establishments) was observed. Several people attempted suicide after hearing the news; most of them were rescued. The funeral cortège the next day started from Sree Kanteerava Stadium to Kanteerava Studios a few minutes before 12:30 pm (IST), a distance of . Around two million people followed his remains. However, the entire procession was marked with violence with mourners attacking public property, and police, who resorted to lathi-charge and tear gas. Passing through Krishna Raja Circle, Palace Road, T. Chowdiah Road, Sadashivanagar, Yeswanthpur and Goraguntepalya localities, the cortège reached the Studios at 4:45 pm (IST). His body was buried with State honours at 5:45 p.m (IST) at the premises of the studios. The last rites were performed by his eldest son Shiva, guided by priests from the city&#x27;s ISKCON and the Gayathri Temples.

The then President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had condoled his death. In the condolence message, he had praised his versatility and everlasting contributions to the Indian cinema.

On 19 April, the government of Karnataka announced that a memorial would be made in Rajkumar&#x27;s honour at Kanteerava Studios in association with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce at the cost 100 million. The blueprint of the memorial was cleared by a panel comprising members of Rajkumar&#x27;s family, representatives of the Kannada film industry and the state government. After a delay over allocation of funds and land, it was finally opened in November 2014, after a sum of 70 million was used in developing it over an area of . It included &quot;an open-air auditorium, mini-water body, landscaping and a bust&quot; of Rajkumar. 40 photographs of selected films of Rajkumar were kept on display at the inauguration. A permanent exhibition on the history of Rajkumar&#x27;s films that included his photographs, trophies and souvenirs, alongside a stock of dialogue, scripts, songs and other memorabilia associated with him were put on display. An annual calendar for 2012 was released containing photographs of Rajkumar and stills from his films. His fan clubs conduct blood donation and eye donation camps on the occasion of his birth and death anniversaries every year.

After his death, two audio companies - Saregama India Limited and Mars Recording Private Limited - were pitted against each other over the copyright of his songs as per Section 52(j) of The Copyright Act, 1957.

==Acting versatility==
It was observed that after 15 years into his career, in the mid sixties, when new young filmmakers were searching for actors who were less theatrical, Rajkumar had to undergo a transformation in his acting style and succeeded in proving that he could handle roles which were subtle, mellow and soft without the need for theatrical histrionics. He went on to be known for portraying versatile roles with elan.

He was also praised for his ability to integrate actors&#x27; virtues with the power of a superstar without letting one erase the other by acting as a gulf between mainstream popular movies and artistic cinemas. It was also noted that it was his subtle acting prowess, spontaneous style and his flair to give the reel characters a real credibility which singled him out to the top and helped him to never be out of the running by withstanding the onslaught of time, age and the ever changing demands of celluloid world.

Jnanapith awardee U. R. Ananthamurthy had noted that movies of Rajkumar were less melodramatic than the movies of his counterparts at that time in other languages—MGR, Sivaji Ganesan and NTR.

His last movie &quot;Shabdavedhi&quot; (2000) was about drug abuse and its ill effects on the youth.

== Mass appeal and popularity==
Veteran journalist and writer Patil Puttappa had described Rajkumar as a natural strength of Kannada whose mass appeal was much more than any leader in Indian politics. He was also praised for confining himself to the Kannada cinema through a conscious decision. His movies were praised for showing consistent interest in building a Kannada society and not a Kannada nation as such. They were also noted for holding up the value of civility and refrain from peddling hatred. His presence was reported to have filled the void between the state and the nation which neither the littérateurs nor the politicians could accomplish.

Some observers are of the opinion that his star appeal helped bring together the diverse regions of Karnataka. The state was carved out in 1956, bringing together different regions like Hyderabad Karnataka, which were areas ruled by the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad; Mumbai Karnataka, which has a strong Marathi influence; Old Mysore region ruled by the Mysore royal family and the hilly regions and coastal belt. Each region has a distinct identity within the state and Rajkumar was accepted as a Kannada icon across all regions. He spoke Kannada in a distinct way which had a universal appeal across the state. This was an important aspect since his career played out when the state&#x27;s identity was still evolving. Rajkumar&#x27;s movies were largely credited for creating a unified Kannada cultural space after the formation of the state. It was reported that before linguistic reorganisation of the states, the default state border for the Kannada speaking population was the last point where Rajkumar films were distributed.

He was considered as a strong symbol of Kannada identity. 
Bollywood actor Prithviraj Kapoor had requested Rajkumar to act with him in a Hindi movie but Rajkumar had refused the offer in spite of Hindi movies having wider market than Kannada. Later, Prithviraj Kapoor went on to share the screen with him in the Kannada movie &quot;Sakshatkara&quot; directed by Puttanna Kanagal. He had also refused to appear in a cameo for Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s 1983 Hindi movie &quot;Coolie&quot; as he did not want to appear in a non-Kannada movie. Further, he thought that it would not be good for an actor to look down on another actor as the scene involved Amitabh touching the feet of Rajkumar&#x27;s character - a sequence which appeared before the introduction song of Amitabh&#x27;s character. In spite of having appeared only in Kannada movies, he was reasonably popular amongst the non- Kannadigas too. His films have inspired many non-Kannadigas to learn the language. In spite of strong Kannada conservatism in his movies, they were noted to have transcended the barriers of language to connect with the ethos of the nation.

Kuvempu considered him to be the most suitable ambassador to propagate his idea of &quot;Universal Human (Vishwamanava)&quot;. His 1972 movie &quot;Bangaarada Manushya&quot; was credited for inspiring the urban youth to take up farming by popularising modern farming technology.

Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor had called him &quot;The emperor of all actors&quot;. Rana Daggubati had revealed that he had referred Rajkumar&#x27;s performance in the 1983 movie &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot; for his preparation for the role of Hiranyakashipu.

During the interview for promotions of &quot;2.0&quot;, Rajinikanth had said that 10 MGRs were equal to 1 Rajkumar. Rajinikanth had also revealed that the only autograph he has ever taken in his life is of Rajkumar. He had also remarked that Rajkumar was a combination of MGR and Sivaji Ganesan. Vishnuvardhan said he was biggest worshipper of Rajkumar.

B. Saroja Devi called upon the present generation artistes to adopt and emulate the values and ideals cherished by the actor for the growth of the Kannada film industry.

The Pampa Award for writers was instituted by the Government of Karnataka on his behest. The cash prize of ₹1,00,000 which he received with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was given as donation to Kannada Sahitya Parishat. He gave away the proceeds of 57 musical night programmes as donations to build stadiums in 21 districts of Karnataka.

After Rajkumar&#x27;s eyes were donated as per his last wish, the eye donation in Karnataka was reported to have increased by 400%. The director of the 2021 Kannada movie &quot;Akshi&quot; which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Kannada at the 67th National Film Awards had revealed that the act of eye donation by Rajkumar was the inspiration for the plot of his movie.

The initial move to shift the operations of the Kannada cinema gradually from Madras to Bangalore has been credited to Rajkumar&#x27;s home productions.

As of April 2016, 71 books and 9 souvenirs have been published on Rajkumar. In 2015, after 15 years of research, Doddahulluru Rukkoji released a two-volume, 2,148 page book chronicling Rajkumar&#x27;s life and achievements. As of May 2023, close to 100 statues of Rajkumar were found in Bangalore alone.

On the occasion of Rajkumar&#x27;s 90th birthday, an audio-visual musical extravaganza fund raiser programme titled &quot;Raj Vaibhava&quot; was conducted in Greater Boston for the benefit of a retirement home in Mumbai. In 2012, an entertainment programme called &quot;Dr.Raj Vaibhava&quot; based on his movies and songs was conducted in Kuwait in his honour.

In 2018, in the run up to the relaunch of Jawa motorbikes, the marketing team of Mahindra &amp; Mahindra used the climax bike stunt sequence of his 1976 movie &quot;Naa Ninna Mareyalare&quot; as a part of their promotion strategy.

The tableau of Krishnadevaraya at the 2021 Delhi Republic Day parade was reported to be modelled on Rajkumar. The team of the Kannada movie &quot;Daredevil Musthafa&quot; released an animation song as a tribute to Rajkumar based on the popular theatre song &quot;Ninnanthor Yaaru Ilvallo&quot; composed by B. V. Karanth in the honour of Mysore King Kanthirava Narasaraja I whose role was portrayed by Rajkumar in the 1960 movie &quot;Ranadheera Kanteerava&quot;. Flower show conducted at Lal Bagh as a tribute to him on the occasion of 75th Independence Day in August 2022 was attended by 8.34 lakh people generating a revenue of ₹3.33 crore.

===Politics===
Political analyst MK Bhaskar Rao had revealed that the Janata Party&#x27;s J. H. Patel and George Fernandes had approached Rajkumar to contest against Indira Gandhi in the 1978 Chikkamagaluru Lok Sabha byelection but he refused saying he wanted to remain apolitical.

&quot;The Hindu&quot; had reported that Rajkumar could have swept any poll effortlessly but had decided that the affection and love of the people should not be used to attain power. It was also reported that Rajkumar declined to enter politics despite immense pressure as he did not want to be used only as a weapon to defeat anyone and not for any positive contribution. He shunned publicity and politics all his life. He was also credited for protecting and promoting the Kannada language without opting for a political career.

==Lifestyle==
Rajkumar was known for being a highly disciplined man in both his personal and professional lives. He practised Carnatic music for an hour each day in the morning and in the evening. He was referred to as &quot;Gaanagandharva&quot; (translation: a heavenly singer). His punctuality is another noted aspect. Waking up every morning at 4 am, he performed Yoga and Pranayama, which is said to be the reason behind his physical and mental fitness. His Yoga performances can be seen in the first clips of his film &quot;Kaamana Billu&quot;. His waist size was 32 at the time of his death. This fitness is attributed to his practice of Yoga. Actor John Kokken had revealed that Rajkumar was the inspiration behind him performing Yoga every day.

He shunned smoking and drinking both on screen and off. To avoid setting a precedent among his fans, he made sure that the roles he accepted did not require him to smoke or drink or utter swear words, and extended this decision to real life. His dress code always consisted of a simple white dhoti and shirt. He spent most of his vacations in his hometown, Gajanur, near the forest area where he was later abducted.

In 1961, he led a movement to collect funds for drought relief. He would always refer to his movie-producers as &quot;Anna Daataru&quot; (food providers) and adored fans as &quot;Abhimaani Devarugalu&quot; (Fan Gods).

He was a devotee of Raghavendra Swami. When Dr. Rajkumar was chosen for the role of saint Raghavendra Swamiji for &quot;Mantralaya Mahatme&quot; by T.V. Singh Thakur in 1966, there was an objection from the Madhwa community. They were against a non-vegetarian playing the role of Mantralaya seer. However, Dr. Rajkumar gave up non-vegetarian food and lived like a saint during the entire shoot of the film.

Girish Kasaravalli had praised his simplicity, humility, innocence and straight-forwardness. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao called him as one of the two funniest people he has come across in his life. S. P. Balasubrahmanyam had praised his courteous and down to earth nature.

Reminiscing his old days, Kannada director J.G.Krishna had revealed that Rajkumar was responsible for light boys being served food by the film production team after he discovered that they were not being served food on the sets and took initiative to make it mandatory for all Kannada film producers to bear the food cost of the light boys treating them on par with the employees of the production house.

In 2001, he started &quot;Shaktidhaama&quot; - a rehabilitation home for 800 destitute women who were rescued from prostitution. He endorsed Karnataka Milk Federation&#x27;s &quot;Nandini&quot; brand of milk for free.

A touching testimonial to his commitment to lead by example was that he had pledged his eyes in 1994 at the time of inauguration of &quot; Dr. Rajkumar Eye Bank&quot; and he rightly did so after his death in 2006. His act of eye donation was likened to the role in his debut movie &quot;Bedara Kannappa&quot; where he plucks his eyes in the climax to replace the bleeding eyes of the &quot;Shivalinga&quot;.

==Kannada language movement ==

Although Rajkumar rejected numerous offers to don the political mantle, he was able to influence the State&#x27;s political fortunes without ever being officially involved in politics. Despite his apolitical outlook, he was able to protect and espouse the cause of Kannada and Karnataka. He continually advocated the cause of seeking primacy for Kannada, was asked to lead a movement to make Kannada a compulsory language for primary education based on the &quot;Gokak report&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Gokak Varadhi.&quot; He became actively involved in the movement and soon became the force behind the Gokak movement. He led rallies from Belagavi to Bengaluru and gave speeches about the importance of Kannada Gokak agitation. Millions of people gathered for the opportunity to have a glimpse of Rajkumar and listen to his speeches. The power of this movement caused the government to relent and make Kannada a compulsory language of education in Karnataka.

== Filmography ==
==Awards and honours==
Rajkumar was awarded numerous State, National and International awards. He was a recipient of the Padma Bhushan, a doctorate from Mysore University and the Karnataka Ratna, the highest civilian honour of the State of Karnataka, recognising him as a &quot;Jewel of Karnataka State&quot;.

In 1985, he was honoured with the Kentucky Colonel award. In 1995, he received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his outstanding contributions to the Kannada film industry.

In 2011, during the 83rd birth anniversary of Rajkumar, the Chief Minister of Karnataka announced that the state government recommended that he be awarded a Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the country, for his outstanding contributions to the film industry.

<text>Private cancellations are cancellations of postage stamps, or in some cases, artist stamps applied by other than a government or other official stamp-issuing entity.

==In the United States==
Private postmarks are commonly used with private postal meters. They are also occasionally used to create &quot;first day of issue&quot; items for personalized U.S. postage (officially defined as meter labels and thus not requiring cancellation). Private cancellations are often applied by local posts to their stamps (this is frequently also the first day of issue). 

Another type of private cancellation, used in the United States, is the Mailer&#x27;s Postmark Permit, by which license-holders can cancel their own mail under certain conditions. They can in the U.S. be applied to mail carried outside the post by authority of the private express statutes. An example of this is the Chickensville, Michigan private cancellation, applied to mail carried, although Chickensville does not have a post office.

Private postmarks have also been used as back-stamps showing the name of the firm from which the mail was sent.

===United States taxation===
In the United States if the time of posting is significant and there is both a private and regular cancellation, the regular cancellation controls. Private postmarks are not considered valid in some other cases.

<text>Kannada cinema, also known as Sandalwood, or Chandanavana, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Kannada language widely spoken in the state of Karnataka. Kannada cinema is based in Gandhi Nagar, Bengaluru. The 1934 film &quot;Sati Sulochana&quot; directed by Y. V. Rao was the first talkie film released in the Kannada language. It was also the first film starring Subbaiah Naidu and Tripuramba, and the first screened in the erstwhile Mysore Kingdom. It was produced by Chamanlal Doongaji, who in 1932 founded &quot;South India Movietone&quot; in Bengaluru.

Major literary works have been adapted to the Kannada screen, such as B. V. Karanth&#x27;s &quot;Chomana Dudi&quot; (1975), (based on &quot;Chomana Dudi&quot; by Shivaram Karanth), Girish Karnad&#x27;s &quot;Kaadu&quot; (1973), (based on &quot;Kaadu&quot; by Srikrishna Alanahalli), Pattabhirama Reddy&#x27;s &quot;Samskara&quot; (1970) (based on &quot;Samskara&quot; by U. R. Ananthamurthy), which won the Bronze Leopard at Locarno International Film Festival, and T. S. Nagabharana&#x27;s &quot;Mysuru Mallige&quot; (1992), based on the works of poet K. S. Narasimhaswamy.

Kannada cinema is known for producing experimental works such as Girish Kasaravalli&#x27;s &quot;Ghatashraddha&quot; (1977), which won the Ducats Award at the Manneham Film Festival Germany, &quot;Dweepa&quot; (2002), which won Best Film at Moscow International Film Festival, Singeetam Srinivasa Rao&#x27;s silent film &quot;Pushpaka Vimana&quot; (1987), Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s docudrama &quot;Killing Veerappan&quot; (2016), Prashanth Neel&#x27;s action franchise &quot;K. G. F. film series&quot; being the highest-grossing Kannada film, and Rishab Shetty&#x27;s &quot;Kantara&quot; (2022).

Kannada cinema is reported to have 8% market share in the gross domestic box office collections for the period January to August 2022, making it the fourth-biggest Indian film industry. The share rose to 9% by October 2022. The total gross collections of the top five Kannada movies of 2022 in first ten months was reported to be ₹1800 crores. The year 2022 began new era for the industry in terms of popularity, quality content and collections. However, the market share of Kannada movies in the gross domestic box office collections declined to 2% in 2023 with the footfalls dropping from 8.1 to 3.2 crores in 2022.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1934, the first Kannada talkie, &quot;Sati Sulochana&quot;, appeared in theatres, followed by &quot;Bhakta Dhruva&quot; (aka &quot;Dhruva Kumar&quot;). &quot;Sati Sulochana&quot;, starring Subbaiah Naidu and Tripuramba, was shot in Kolhapur at the Chatrapathi studio; most filming, sound recording, and post-production was done in Chennai.

In 1949, Honnappa Bhagavathar, who had earlier acted in Gubbi Veeranna&#x27;s films, produced &quot;Bhakta Kumbara&quot; and starred in the lead role along with Pandaribai. In 1955, Bhagavathar again produced a Kannada film, &quot;Mahakavi Kalidasa&quot;, in which he introduced actress B. Saroja Devi. B. S. Ranga was an Indian photographer, actor, writer, producer and director made many landmark movies in Kannada, under Vikram Studios.

===Mainstream===
Matinee idol, Rajkumar entered Kannada cinema after his long stint as a dramatist with Gubbi Veeranna&#x27;s &quot;Gubbi Drama Company&quot;, which he joined at the age of eight, before he got his first break as a lead in the 1954 film &quot;Bedara Kannappa&quot;.

He went on to essay a variety of roles and excelling in portraying mythological and historical characters in films such as &quot;Bhakta Kanakadasa&quot; (1960), &quot;Ranadheera Kanteerava&quot; (1960), &quot;Satya Harishchandra&quot; (1965), &quot;Immadi Pulikeshi&quot; (1967), &quot;Sri Krishnadevaraya&quot; (1970), &quot;Bhakta Kumbara&quot; (1974), &quot;Mayura&quot; (1975), &quot;Babruvahana&quot; (1977) and &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot; (1983). His wife Parvathamma Rajkumar founded Film production and distribution company, Sri Vajreshwari Combines.

Vishnuvardhan entered Kannada cinema with the National Award-winning movie &quot;Vamsha Vriksha&quot; (1972) directed by Girish Karnad based on the novel written by S. L. Bhyrappa. His first lead role was in &quot;Naagarahaavu&quot;, directed by Puttanna Kanagal and based on a novel by T. R. Subba Rao. It was the first in Kannada film history to complete 100 days in three main theatres of Bangalore. In his 37-year career, he has played a variety of roles in more than 200 films.
With his debut in Puttanna Kanagal&#x27;s National Award-winning Kannada film &quot;Naagarahaavu&quot; (1972), Ambareesh&#x27;s acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic and supporting characters. After establishing himself as a lead actor portraying rebellious characters on screen in a number of commercially successful films, he earned the moniker &quot;rebel star&quot;. He also earned the nickname &quot;Mandyada Gandu&quot; ( Man of Mandya)

Rajkumar, Vishnuvardhan and Ambareesh are collectively known as Kannada cinema&#x27;s triumvirate.

Method actor Shankar Nag received the inaugural IFFI Best Actor Award (Male): Silver Peacock Award&quot; at the 7th International Film Festival of India for his work in the film &quot;Ondanondu Kaladalli&quot;. He is the younger brother of actor Anant Nag. M. V. Vasudeva Rao, the first Kannada actor to win National Film Award for Best Actor, was starred in over 200 films in his career; however, post &quot;Chomana Dudi&quot;, he only played minor roles.
B. Saroja Devi is one of the most successful female leads in the history of Indian cinema and has acted in around 200 films in over seven decades. She is known by the epithets &quot;&quot;Abinaya Saraswathi&quot; (Saraswati of acting) in Kannada and &quot;Kannadathu Paingili&quot;&quot; (Kannada&#x27;s Parrot) in Tamil.

M. V. Rajamma (first female producer of Indian cinema) and Pandari Bai are considered as the earliest female superstars of Kannada cinema. Other popular female actresses of 1950s through 1990s include Prathima devi, Harini, Leelavathi, Jayanthi, Kalpana, Bharathi, Lakshmi, Aarathi, Manjula, Jayamala, Arundathi, Suhasini, Sudharani,Tara, Malashree, Shruthi, Soundarya, Prema among others.

===Neo-realistic cinema===

Kannada Cinema majorly contributed to the parallel cinema movement of India. Directors like Girish Kasaravalli, Girish Karnad, G. V. Iyer were the early names to join the movement. T. S. Nagabharana and B. V. Karanth were also popular names in the movement. Puttanna Kanagal&#x27;s films were however considered a bridge between Mainstream and Parallel Cinema.

===Modern era===

Prakash Raj began his acting career with Doordarshan serials such as &quot;Bisilu Kudure&quot; (Kannada) and &quot;Guddada Bhootha&quot; (Tulu and Kannada). He later took up supporting roles in Kannada films such as &quot;Ramachari&quot;, &quot;Ranadheera&quot;, &quot;Nishkarsha&quot; and &quot;Lockup Death&quot;. He was known for his dialogue delivery and histrionics. His breakthrough role came in &quot;Harakeya Kuri&quot;, directed by K. S. L. Swamy starring Vishnuvardhan, with whom he had acted in other films such as &quot;Mithileya Seetheyaru&quot;, &quot;Muthina Haara&quot; and &quot;Nishkarsha&quot;. Prakash re-entered Kannada films through &quot;Nagamandala&quot; in 1997, directed by T. S. Nagabharana. Veteran Kannada actor Shakti Prasad&#x27;s son Arjun Sarja is known for his work in South Indian cinema. He starred in movies such as Prasad; the film was screened at the Berlin Film Festival and Arjun received the Karnataka State Award for his performance in it.

Sanchari Vijay&#x27;s portrayal of a transgender won him the National Best Actor Award. With the award, Vijay became the third actor after M. V. Vasudeva Rao, and Charuhasan to win the National Award for Best Actor for a performance in a Kannada film.

Shiva Rajkumar is known for his work in &quot;Janumada Jodi&quot;, &quot;Anand&quot;, &quot;Ratha Sapthami&quot;, &quot;Nammoora Mandara Hoove&quot;, &quot;Om&quot;, &quot;Simhada Mari&quot; and &quot;Chigurida Kanasu&quot;.

<text>A plankowner (also referred to a plank owner and sometimes a plank holder) is an individual who was a member of the crew of a United States Navy ship or United States Coast Guard Cutter, or a Royal Canadian Navy ship, when that ship was placed in commission. Originally, this term applied only to crew members that were present at the ship&#x27;s first commissioning. Today, however, plankowner is often applied to members of newly commissioned units, new military bases and recommissioning crews as well.

==In U.S. military==
Plankowner is a term used by the United States Navy, and has consequently been variously defined by different units. The origin of the term is the implication that a crew member was around when the ship was being built and commissioned, and therefore has bragging rights to the &quot;ownership&quot; of one of the planks in the main deck.

Historically, a plankowner in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, or his widow, could petition the Naval Historical Center&#x27;s Curator Branch for a piece of the deck when the ship was decommissioned. This practice has been discontinued and stocks of planking that existed at the Curator branch have been donated to various veteran&#x27;s organizations.

Sailors who are plankowners at their current command often have the word &quot;PLANKOWNER&quot; embroidered on the back of their uniform ball cap to denote this designation. A plaque is placed aboard the ship with the crew names. When in port, the departure of a plankowner for the final time is usually announced on the 1MC public announcing system with a bell-ring, as &lt;ding, ding&gt; &quot;Plankowner, departing&quot;.

In the United States Navy SEALs, the term refers to the original or &quot;founding&quot; members of a SEAL Team.

<doc id="515468" wikidata="Q1570052" url="?curid=515468" title="Processed cheese">
<text>Processed cheese (also known as process cheese; related terms include cheese food, prepared cheese, cheese product, and/or government cheese) is a product made from cheese mixed with an emulsifying agent (actually a calcium chelator). Additional ingredients, such as vegetable oils, unfermented dairy ingredients, salt, food coloring, or sugar may be included. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist. Processed cheese typically contains around 50 to 60% cheese and 40 to 50% other ingredients.

==History==
Processed cheese was first developed in Switzerland in 1911, when Walter Gerber and Fritz Stettler, seeking a cheese with longer shelf life and influenced by fondue and cheese sauces, added sodium citrate to melted Emmentaler cheese and found that the emulsified cheese sauce could be re-cooled into a solid again. Shortly after, in 1916, Canadian-American businessman James L. Kraft applied for the first U.S. patent covering a new method of storing cheese, which halts the maturation process by sterilization.

== Advantages ==

Processed cheese has several technical advantages over natural cheese, including a far longer shelf life, resistance to separating when cooked (meltability), and a uniform look and physical behavior. Its mass-produced nature also provides a dramatically lower cost—to producers and consumers alike—than conventional cheesemaking. This, in turn, enables industrial-scale production volumes, lower distribution costs, a steadier supply, and much faster production time compared to traditional cheeses.

Because processed cheese does not separate when melted, it is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. Unlike some unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste or texture.

== Chemistry ==
Processed cheese is made with the goal of being meltable without the fat separating from the protein. A traditional cheese consists of individual fat globules trapped in a network of casein, with calcium holding the casein molecules together. With prolonged heating, the typical result is a lumpy combination of protein gel and liquid fat on top. Processed cheese adds a &quot;calcium-sequestering agent&quot;, often mistakenly called an &quot;emulsifier&quot; (&quot;emulsifying salt&quot; and &quot;emulsifying agent&quot; are correct, however), to stop calcium from being able to hold this casein network together. Smaller groups of linked casein molecules are then able to better mix into the fat when melted, forming microscopic droplets instead of large lumps. Common calcium-sequestering agents include sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, tartrate, and citrate. (Tartaric acid found in wine is &quot;the&quot; original calcium-sequestering agent used in Swiss fondue.)

The longer shelf-life is not directly because of the emulsifying agent, but because it allows existing heat-based sterilization methods, such as canning, to be applied to the cheese without forming lumps.

== Sale and labeling ==
Processed cheese is often sold in blocks and packs of individual slices, often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually wrapped by machine. Processed cheese was initially sold in unpressurized cans; some is still sold this way.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, processed cheese is typically sold in individually wrapped slices, often referred to as &quot;singles&quot; (in reference to Kraft singles, despite the branded product not being typically available in the UK.) Sometimes, adjectives like &quot;cheesy&quot; are used in the name of &quot;singles&quot; to circumvent laws regarding what can be referred to as cheese. Dairylea and The Laughing Cow are leading brands.

=== United States ===
In 1916, Canadian-American James L. Kraft applied for the first U.S. patent for a method of making processed cheese. Kraft Foods Inc. developed the first commercially available, shelf-stable, sliced processed cheese; it was introduced in 1950. The first commercially available individually wrapped cheese slices were introduced in the US by Clearfield Cheese Co. in 1956. These forms of processed cheese have become ubiquitous in U.S. households ever since, most notably used for cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches because of its ability to cook evenly, distribute/stretch smoothly, and resist congealing, unlike traditional cheddar cheeses. Competitors lobbied unsuccessfully to require processed cheese be labeled &quot;embalmed cheese&quot;.

The best known processed cheese in the United States is marketed as American cheese by Kraft Foods, Borden, and other companies. It is yellow or off-white, mild, has a medium consistency and melts easily. It is typically made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and cheddar. Another type of processed cheese created in the United States is Provel pizza cheese, which uses cheddar, Swiss, and provolone cheeses as flavorants. Provel cheese is commonly used in St. Louis-style pizza.

== Legal definitions ==
The high proportion of additives in processed cheese and similar products (e.g. unfermented dairy products, emulsifiers, oils, salts, and colors) means that some products made in this way cannot legally be labeled as cheese in many countries, even though similar products containing a higher percentage of cheese can be.

In the United States, the term &quot;processed cheese&quot; refers to products with the highest cheese content, made from cheese, up to 5% milkfat, and other allowed additives. Terms such as &quot;cheese food&quot; or &quot;cheese spread&quot; refer to products with lower amounts of cheese. &quot;Cheese product&quot; is an unregulated term used by some manufacturers for products that do not meet any of the standards.

=== United States ===
In the United States, processed cheese is defined, categorized, and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Section 133 (&quot;Cheeses and Cheese-Related Products&quot;). Three of the main classes are: 
;Pasteurized process cheese (§133.169)
:PPC is a product made from one or more cheeses (excluding certain cheeses such as cream cheese and cottage cheese, but including American cheese), mixed with emusifying salts.
: Acceptable additives include acidifying agents, source of milkfat (cream, anhydrous milkfat, dehydrated cream), water, salt, artificial color, spices or flavorings (other than those simulating the flavor of cheese), and enzyme-modified cheese. PPC in consumer-sized packages can also include mold inhibitor and lecithin. Added milk fat must not exceed 5% by weight.
:In the final product, moisture must not be more than 41 percent of the weight, and fat content not less than 49 percent. The moisture and fat contents must also fall into the acceptable range for its source cheese(s).
; (§133.173)
:PPCF is made from one or more of the cheeses available for pasteurized process cheese composing not less than 51 percent of the final weight, mixed with one or more optional dairy ingredients such as cream, fluid milk, or whey.
: Acceptable additives include emulsifying salts, acidifying agents, water, salt, artificial color, spices or flavorings (other than those simulating the flavor of cheese), and enzyme-modified cheese. PPCF in consumer-sized packages can also include mold inhibitor and lecithin.
: The final solid form must be less than 44 percent moisture and have a fat content greater than 23 percent.
; Pasteurized process cheese spread (§133.179)
: PPCS is made similarly to pasteurized process cheese food but must be spreadable at . Moisture must be between 44 and 60 percent of the total weight, and fat content greater than 20 percent. Nisin may be added.

==== Use of unregulated terms ====
The FDA does not maintain a standard of identity for either &quot;pasteurized prepared cheese product&quot;, a designation which particularly appears on many Kraft products, or &quot;pasteurized process cheese product&quot;, a designation which appears particularly on many American store- and generic-branded singles. Since by using undefined terms the manufacturers technically avoid being accused of false labeling, products carrying such labels are free to use milk protein concentrate (MPC) in their formulations, an ingredient the FDA does not permit in processed cheese. The desire to use inexpensive imported milk protein concentrate to replace some of the cheese in their products is noted as motivation for the manufacturers to introduce these and similar terms, and for the relabeling of some products. After an FDA Warning Letter protesting Kraft&#x27;s use of MPC in late 2002, some varieties of Kraft Singles formerly labeled &quot;pasteurized process cheese food&quot; became &quot;pasteurized prepared cheese product&quot;, Velveeta was relabeled from &quot;pasteurized process cheese spread&quot; to &quot;pasteurized prepared cheese product&quot;, and Easy Cheese from &quot;pasteurized process cheese spread&quot; to &quot;pasteurized cheese snack&quot;.

<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 794, adopted unanimously on 3 December 1992, after reaffirming resolutions 733 (1992), 746 (1992), 751 (1992), 767 (1992) and 775 (1992), the Council &quot;[expressed] grave alarm&quot; regarding the situation in Somalia and authorised the creation of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) to create a &quot;secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia&quot; in order to provide &quot;essential for the survival of the civilian population&quot;. The current resolution determined that &quot;the magnitude of human tragedy caused by the conflict in Somalia, further exacerbated by the obstacles being created to the distribution of humanitarian assistance [constitutes] a threat to international peace and security&quot;.

The Council once again, strongly condemned violations of international humanitarian law and demanded the cessation of all hostilities from all parties involved, urging them to co-operate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and military, including allowing access by military personnel and humanitarian organisations to the affected population and to ensure their safety. It also authorised a further deployment of 3,500 personnel of the United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNISOM I) created in Resolution 775 to Somalia and informing it should proceed at the discretion of the Secretary-General.

The resolution went on to endorse a recommendation by the Secretary-General that action should be taken under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and welcomed offers by Member States concerning the creation of an operation to create a secure environment for humanitarian operations, that later became known as UNITAF. At the time of his report, disarmament and the problem of security was not resolved. The Council authorised such action to be taken by Member States, and appointed an &quot;ad hoc&quot; commission composed of members of the Security Council to report on the implementation of the current resolution.

Acting under Chapter VII and Chapter VIII, the Council urged states and agencies to ensure strict implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia imposed in Resolution 733. Resolution 794 ended by requiring states participating in UNITAF and the Secretary-General to report regularly on the progress they are making in Somalia so that arrangements can be handed back over to UNISOM II.

Within days of passing the current resolution, on 9 December 1992, the first UNITAF troops arrived in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. It was the first Security Council resolution that authorised the use of force under Chapter VII to deliver humanitarian aid that was being obstructed by warlords, and the fourth major military engagement since the Cold War, following the invasion of Kuwait, the deployment of peacekeepers in Cambodia and a further deployment of peacekeepers in Yugoslavia.

The DAAD itself does not offer programs of study or courses, but awards competitive, merit-based grants for use toward study and/or research in Germany at any of the accredited German institutions of higher education. It also awards grants to German students, doctoral students, and scholars for studies and research abroad. With an annual budget of 522 million Euros and supporting approximately 140.000 individuals world-wide, the DAAD is in fact the largest such academic grant organisation worldwide The organisation was founded on 1 January 1925 but closed down in 1945, only to be re-founded again in 1950.

The DAAD New York office serves residents of the United States and Canada who are enrolled or employed at American and Canadian higher education institutions and would like to study or pursue research in Germany. From the perspective of this side of the exchange, the DAAD&#x27;s mission is to facilitate American and Canadian students&#x27; access to the distinguished German institutions of higher education and research—from research universities (Universitäten) to universities of applied sciences (Fachhochschule), colleges of music and art, libraries and archives, and research institutions such as the Max Planck Institutes.

==Leadership for Syria Programme==
During the fall of 2014, the DAAD, supported by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, launched a program called the &quot;Leadership for Syria&quot;. The declared aim of the program was to create &quot;a select elite among Syria&#x27;s future leadership&quot; for &quot;active participation in organizing&quot; post-war Syria. In the initial stage of the program, 271 Syrians seen as suitable for university scholarships were chosen from potential candidates who were &quot;either still living in Syria or in one of the bordering countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey), or who had fled to Germany&quot;. The former were then brought to Germany to join those participants who were already there. The scholarships were to various universities throughout Germany. The German Foreign Office funded the bulk of the scholarships (200) with the balance being sponsored by Baden-Württemberg (50) and North Rhine-Westphalia (21). The scholarship curriculum included an introductory language course for those students who were not already fluent in, or otherwise had no prior knowledge of, German. Alongside this was a concomitant obligatory element intended to imbue the planned future Syrian elite with the &quot;fundamental and practical knowledge and skills in political sciences, economics, social sciences, as well as operational competence.&quot;
