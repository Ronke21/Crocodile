<text>The Age of Innocence is a novel by American author Edith Wharton, published on 25 October 1920. It was her eighth novel, and was initially serialized in 1920 in four parts, in the magazine &quot;Pictorial Review&quot;. Later that year, it was released as a book by D. Appleton &amp; Company. It won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, making Wharton the first woman to win the prize. Though the committee had initially agreed to give the award to Sinclair Lewis for &quot;Main Street&quot;, the judges, in rejecting his book on political grounds, &quot;established Wharton as the American &#x27;First Lady of Letters. The story is set in the 1870s, in upper-class, &quot;Gilded Age&quot; New York City. Wharton wrote the book in her 50s, after she was already established as a major author in high demand by publishers.

== Background ==
&quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, which was set in the time of Wharton&#x27;s childhood, than &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, which Wharton had published in 1905. In her autobiography, Wharton wrote that &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; had allowed her to find &quot;a momentary escape in going back to my childish memories of a long-vanished America... it was growing more and more evident that the world I had grown up in and been formed by had been destroyed in 1914.&quot; Scholars and readers alike agree that &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; is fundamentally a story which struggles to reconcile the old with the new.

Wharton was raised in the old world of rigid and proper New York society which features in the story. She had spent her middle years, including the whole of World War I, in Europe, where the devastation of a new kind of mechanized warfare was felt most deeply. As explained by Millicent Bell in the Cambridge companion to Wharton, &quot;&quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; was composed and first read in the aftermath of [Theodore] Roosevelt&#x27;s death and in the immediate wake of World War I. We frame the ending remembering the multiple losses... not only the loss of Roosevelt but the destruction of the prewar world and all that Wharton valued in it.&quot;

&quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; centers on an upper-class couple&#x27;s impending marriage, and the introduction of the bride&#x27;s cousin, plagued by scandal, whose presence threatens their happiness. Though the novel questions the assumptions and morals of 1870s New York society, it never develops into an outright condemnation of the institution. The novel is noted for Wharton&#x27;s attention to detail and its accurate portrayal of how the 19th-century East Coast American upper class lived, as well as for the social tragedy of its plot. Wharton was 58 years old at publication; she had lived in that world and had seen it change dramatically by the end of World War I.

The title is an ironic comment on the polished outward manners of New York society when compared to its inward machinations. It is believed to have been drawn from the popular painting &quot;A Little Girl&quot; by Sir Joshua Reynolds that later became known as &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (though Reynolds himself never called it that; the title was given by the engraver Joseph Grozer in 1794), and was widely reproduced as the commercial face of childhood in the later half of the 18th century. The title, while ironic, was not as caustic as the title chosen for &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, which Wharton had published in 1905.

==Plot summary==
Newland Archer, gentleman lawyer and heir of one of New York City&#x27;s most illustrious families, happily anticipates his highly desirable marriage to the sheltered and beautiful May Welland. But he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May&#x27;s exotic and fascinating cousin. Ellen strikes Archer as the opposite of the innocent and ignorant May. She has returned to New York from Europe after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a disastrous marriage to a Polish count. At first, Ellen&#x27;s arrival and its potential effect on the reputation of his bride-to-be&#x27;s family disturbs Newland, but he becomes intrigued by Ellen, who brazenly flouts New York society&#x27;s fastidious rules. As Newland&#x27;s admiration for her grows, so do his doubts about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; the match no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined.

Ellen&#x27;s decision to divorce Count Olenski causes a social crisis for the other members of her family, who are terrified of scandal and disgrace. Living apart can be tolerated, but divorce is unacceptable. To save the Wellands&#x27; reputation, a law partner of Newland asks him to dissuade Ellen from going through with the divorce. He succeeds, but in the process comes to care for her. Afraid of falling in love with Ellen, Newland begs May to elope and accelerate their wedding date, but she refuses.

Some weeks later, Newland tells Ellen he loves her; Ellen reciprocates, but is horrified that their love will hurt May, and so does not want him to leave May for her. Newland receives May&#x27;s telegram agreeing to wed sooner.

Newland and May marry. He tries to forget Ellen. His society marriage is mediocre, and the social life he once found absorbing has become empty and joyless. Though Ellen lives in Washington and has remained distant, he is unable to cease loving her. Their paths cross while he and May are in Newport, Rhode Island. Newland discovers that Count Olenski wishes Ellen to return to him, but she has refused, although her family wants her to reconcile with him and return to Europe. Frustrated by her independence, the family has cut off her money, as the count had already done.

Newland obsessively seeks a way to leave May and be with Ellen. Despairing of ever making Ellen his wife, he urges her to run away with him, but she refuses. Then Ellen is recalled to New York City to care for her sick grandmother, who accepts her decision to remain separated and agrees to reinstate her allowance.

Back in New York and under renewed pressure from Newland, Ellen relents and agrees to meet with him in secret to consummate their relationship. But shortly after their conversation, Newland discovers that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. When May announces that she and Newland are throwing a farewell party for Ellen, Newland makes up his mind to abandon May and follow Ellen to Europe. That night, after the party, Newland resolves to tell May he is leaving her for Ellen. She interrupts him to tell him that she learned that morning that she is pregnant; she reveals that she had told Ellen of her pregnancy two weeks earlier, despite not being sure of it at the time. The implication is that May did so because she suspected the affair and that this is Ellen&#x27;s reason for returning to Europe. Hopelessly trapped, Newland decides to remain with May and not to follow Ellen, surrendering his love for his child&#x27;s sake.

Twenty-six years later, after May&#x27;s death, Newland and his eldest son are in Paris. The son, learning that his mother&#x27;s cousin lives there, has arranged to visit Ellen in her Paris apartment. Newland is stunned at the prospect of seeing Ellen again. On arriving outside the apartment building, Newland sends up his son (who resembles his youthful self) alone to meet Ellen, while he waits outside, watching the balcony of her apartment. Newland considers going up, but in the end decides not to; he walks back to his hotel without seeing her. Newland&#x27;s final words about the love affair are &quot;It&#x27;s more real to me here than if I went up.&quot;

==Major characters==

=== Newland Archer ===
The story&#x27;s protagonist is a young, popular, and successful lawyer living with his mother and sister in an elegant New York City house. Since childhood, his life has been shaped by the customs and expectations of upper-class New York City society. His engagement to May Welland is one in a string of accomplishments. At the story&#x27;s start, he is proud and content to dream about a traditional marriage in which he will be the husband-teacher and she the wife-student. His life changes when he meets Countess Ellen Olenska. Through his relationship with her—first friendship, then love—he begins questioning the values on which he was raised. He sees the sexual inequality of New York society and the shallowness of its customs, and struggles to balance social commitment to May with love for Ellen. He cannot find a place for their love in the intricate, judgmental web of New York society. Throughout the story, he transgresses the boundaries of acceptable behavior for love of Ellen: first following her to Skuytercliff, then Boston, and finally deciding to follow her to Europe (though he changes his mind). In the end, Newland finds that the only place for their love is in his memories. Some scholars see Wharton most in Newland, rather than Ellen.

=== May Welland ===
Newland Archer&#x27;s fiancée, then wife. Raised to be a perfect wife and mother, she follows and perfectly obeys all of society&#x27;s customs. Mostly, she is the shallow, uninterested and uninteresting young woman that New York society requires. When they are in St. Augustine, though, May gives Newland a rare glimpse of the maturity and compassion he had previously ignored. She offers to release him from their engagement so he can marry the woman he truly loves, thinking he wants to be with Mrs. Rushworth, a married woman with whom he had recently ended a love affair. When he assures May that he loves only her, May appears to trust him, at least at first. Yet after their marriage, she suspects that Newland is Ellen&#x27;s lover. Nonetheless, May pretends to be happy before society, maintaining the illusion that she and he have the perfect marriage expected of them. Her unhappiness activates her manipulative nature, and Newland does not see it until too late. To drive Ellen away from him, May tells Ellen of her pregnancy before she is certain of it. Yet there still is compassion in May, even in their mediocre marriage&#x27;s long years after Ellen&#x27;s leaving. After May&#x27;s death, Newland Archer learns she had always known of his continued love for Ellen; as May lay dying, she told their son Dallas that the children could always trust their father, Newland, because he surrendered the thing most meaningful to him out of loyalty to their marriage. Outwardly, May is a picture of Innocence.

=== Ellen Olenska ===
May&#x27;s cousin and Mrs. Manson Mingott&#x27;s granddaughter. She became a countess by marrying Polish Count Olenski, a European nobleman. Her husband was allegedly cruel and abusive, stole Ellen&#x27;s fortune and had affairs with other women. When the story begins, Ellen has fled her unhappy marriage, lived in Venice with her husband&#x27;s secretary, and has returned to her family in New York City. She is a free spirit who helps Newland Archer see beyond narrow New York society. She treats her maid, Nastasia, as an equal, offering the servant her own cape before sending her out on an errand. She attends parties with disreputable people such as Julius Beaufort and Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and she invites Newland, the fiancé of her cousin May, to visit her. Ellen suffers as much as Newland from their impossible love, but she is willing to live in emotional limbo so long as they can love each other at a distance. Ellen&#x27;s love for Newland drives her important decisions: dropping divorce from Count Olenski, remaining in America, and offering Newland the choice of sexual consummation only once, and then disappearing from his life. Her conscience and responsibility to family complicate her love for Newland. When she learns of May&#x27;s pregnancy, Ellen immediately decides to leave America, refusing Newland&#x27;s attempt to follow her to Europe, and so allow cousin May to start her family with her husband Newland. The reception of Ellen&#x27;s character has changed over time. From a willful temptress to a fabulously independent woman, far ahead of her time, one thing is for certain: “Ellen has only to walk alone across a drawing room to offend its definitions.”

=== Mrs. Manson Mingott ===
The matriarch of the powerful Mingott family, and grandmother to Ellen and May. She was born Catherine Spicer, to an inconsequential family. Widowed at 28, she has ensured her family&#x27;s social position through her own shrewdness and force of character. She controls her family: at Newland&#x27;s request, she has May and Mrs. Welland agree to an earlier wedding date. She controls the money—withholding Ellen&#x27;s living allowance (when the family is angry with Ellen), and having niece Regina Beaufort ask for money when in financial trouble. Mrs. Mingott is a maverick in the polite world of New York society, at times pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior, such as receiving guests in her house&#x27;s ground floor, though society associates that practice with women of questionable morals. Her welcoming Ellen is viewed skeptically, and she insists the rest of the family support Ellen. Mrs. Mingott was inspired by Edith Wharton&#x27;s own portly great-great-aunt, Mary Mason Jones, who is said to have given rise to the phrase &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot;, due to her belief that fashionable society would always strive to keep up with her.

=== Mrs. Augusta Welland ===
May&#x27;s mother, who has raised her daughter to be a proper society lady. May&#x27;s dullness, lack of imagination, and rigid views of appropriate and inappropriate behavior are a consequence of this influence. Augusta has effectively trained her husband, the weak-willed Mr. Welland, to conform to her desires and wishes. Mrs. Welland is the driving force behind May&#x27;s commitment to a long engagement. Without her mother&#x27;s influence, May might have agreed sooner to Newland&#x27;s request for an earlier wedding date. After a few years of marriage, Newland Archer foresees in May the attributes of his mother-in-law — a woman who is stolid, unimaginative, and dull. Later he comes to experience the same molding by May which was imposed upon Mr. Welland.

== Minor characters ==
*Christine Nilsson: A famous singer who performs in the opera &quot;Faust&quot; on the night of Archer and May&#x27;s engagement at the opening scene of the book. She sings in the same opera two years later.
* Mrs. Lovell Mingott: May and Ellen&#x27;s aunt, and the daughter-in-law of Mrs. Manson Mingott.
* Lawrence Lefferts: A wealthy young man and a member of Archer&#x27;s social circle. He is considered the expert on manners. Archer believes that Lefferts is behind New York society&#x27;s rude refusal to attend the welcome dinner for Ellen. According to Archer, Lefferts makes a big show of his morality every time that his wife, Mrs. Gertrude Lefferts, suspects that he is having an affair.
* Sillerton Jackson: The expert on the families that make up New York society. He knows who is related to whom, and the history of every important family. Mrs. Archer and Janey invite him over for dinner when they want to catch up on gossip.
* Julius Beaufort: An arrogant British banker who tries to have an affair with Ellen. He even follows her to Skuytercliff during the weekend that Archer goes to visit Ellen. His banking business eventually fails, and he leaves New York society in disgrace. His downfall is probably inspired by the Panic of 1873.
* Regina Beaufort: Julius Beaufort&#x27;s wife and Mrs. Manson Mingott&#x27;s niece. She comes to Mrs. Mingott to ask for a loan when her husband&#x27;s bank fails. Her visit causes Mrs. Mingott to have a stroke.
* Janey Archer: Archer&#x27;s dowdy, unmarried sister who never goes out and relies on Archer. She and her mother invite guests to dinner so they can gossip about New York society. Janey disapproves of Ellen, because she is unconventional and independent, and does not simply tolerate her husband&#x27;s abuse.
* Mrs. Adeline Archer: Archer&#x27;s widowed mother. She does not get out to events often, but loves to hear about society. She and Janey strongly believe in the values of New York society. Like Janey, she views Ellen with suspicion. Henry van der Luyden is her cousin. She is said to be based partly on Edith Wharton&#x27;s own mother, Lucretia Rhinelander.
* Mrs. Lemuel Struthers: A woman on the fringes of New York society. She is treated with mistrust and scorn until Ellen befriends her. She eventually becomes popular; at the end of the novel, May thinks it appropriate to go to her parties.
* Count Olenski: Ellen&#x27;s husband, a dissolute aristocrat who drove Ellen away with neglect and misery. At first, Count Olenski is content to let Ellen go. Later, though, he sends his secretary to America to ask Ellen to return, with the stipulation that she need only occasionally appear as his hostess. He never appears in the story. He constantly cheats on Ellen, and a veiled remark of Lefferts&#x27; implies that he copulates with men, too. What other abuses and infidelities he commits are unknown, but he seems quite malicious.
* Sophy Jackson: Sillerton Jackson&#x27;s unmarried sister. She is a friend of Janey and Mrs. Archer.
* Louisa and Henry van der Luyden: Cousins of the Archers, and the most powerful people in New York society. They only mingle with people when they are trying to save society. Mrs. Archer goes to the Van der Luydens after New York society snubs Ellen. They invite her to a very exclusive party in honor of the Duke of St. Austrey to show society that they support her. They are said to be based on the Van Rensselaers, who were cousins of Edith Wharton.
* Duke of St Austrey: An English Duke. A cousin of the Van der Luydens, he is the guest of honor at a dinner party thrown by them. Both Ellen and Archer find him dull.
* Nastasia: Ellen&#x27;s Italian maid. She invites Archer and the other guests to wait in Ellen&#x27;s sitting room.
* Mr. Letterblair: The senior partner of Archer&#x27;s law firm. He gives Archer the responsibility of talking Ellen out of her plans to divorce the Count.
* Mrs. Rushworth: The vain married woman with whom Archer had an affair before his engagement to May.
* Ned Winsett: A journalist. He and Archer are friends, despite their different social circles. He is one of the few people with whom Archer feels that he can have a meaningful conversation. Ned Winsett challenges Archer to think of things outside society.
* Reggie Chivers: An important member of society. Archer spends a weekend at their country home on the Hudson River.
* Marchioness Medora Manson: The aunt who took Ellen to Europe as a child. She now lives in Washington, where Ellen goes to take care of her. During a visit to New York, she tries to persuade Archer to convince Ellen that she should return to the Count. Beaufort&#x27;s bank failure eventually ruins Mrs. Manson&#x27;s fortune, and she moves back to Europe with Ellen.
* Dr. Agathon Carver: A friend (and possible love interest) of the Marchioness Manson. Archer meets him at Ellen&#x27;s house.
* Du Lac aunts: Archer&#x27;s elderly aunts. They offer their country home to May and Archer for their honeymoon.
* Mrs. Carfry: An English acquaintance of Janey and Mrs. Archer. She invites Archer and May to a dinner party while they are on their European wedding tour.
* M. Rivière: The French tutor of Mrs. Carfry&#x27;s nephew. He fascinates Archer with his life story and intellect. Later, Archer learns that he was Count Olenski&#x27;s secretary and the man who helped Ellen escape her marriage. The count sends him to Boston to try to convince Ellen to return to Europe.
* Blenker family: The unfashionable, socially inferior family with whom the Marchioness and Ellen stay while in Newport. They are the guests of honor at Mrs. Emerson Sillerton&#x27;s party, and seem to be a clever, kind bunch.
* Dallas Archer: May and Archer&#x27;s eldest child. He takes his father on a trip to Europe. Through Dallas, Archer learns that May felt sorry for his empty heart after Ellen left.
* Fanny Beaufort: Dallas Archer&#x27;s fiancée and the daughter of Julius Beaufort and his second wife. She asks Dallas to visit Ellen while he and Archer are in Paris.

== Themes ==
One of the most prominent themes that can be seen throughout the text is the idea of wealth and social class. The characters take pride in their social standings and those that come from &quot;old money&quot; feel threatened by those that are coming from &quot;new money&quot;. The characters&#x27; lives revolve around staying up to date on the latest fashion, gatherings, appearances, etc. Being accepted by this high society is the most important thing to the people in this novel and they&#x27;re willing to do anything to be accepted. Being accepted by high-class acquaintances is another common theme that is displayed throughout this novel. Another theme that is clear in the novel is love, whether it be the love between Newland Archer and May Welland, or the undeniable love and lust between Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska. Newland Archer&#x27;s infatuation with May Welland&#x27;s innocence can&#x27;t be missed in the beginning scenes of the novel. The theme of innocence changes throughout the novel, as May states she is pregnant only to ensure that Ellen stays away from Newland.

== Changing perceptions of &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; ==
Helen Killoran explains in &quot;The Critical Reception of Edith Wharton&quot; that critics have always admired Wharton&#x27;s craftsmanship, her attention to structure, and her subtle ironies, along with her description of interiors (attributed to her time as an interior designer). In the decades since the book&#x27;s publication, critics have placed more stress on the portrayal of money and class distinctions in the book.

Ellen Olenska and May Welland have also long been at the heart of critical discussion. Originally perceived as having done the right thing by talking about her pregnancy in order to save her marriage, May Welland can also be seen as manipulative rather than sympathetically desperate. Ellen Olenska brings up the general &quot;woman question&quot; in modern literary criticism.

Rather than focusing on the lavish lifestyle which Newland Archer has not had to work for, some modern readers identify with his grim outlook.

Hillary Kelly suggests that Wharton&#x27;s &quot;status made her story more than believable—it made the story real ... Novelists before Wharton understood that storytelling was an act of exposure, but she built it into the architecture of &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and weaponized it.&quot;

==Film, radio, television, and theatrical adaptations==

*In 1924, a silent-film adaptation was released by Warner Brothers. Directed by Wesley Ruggles, it starred Beverly Bayne as Countess Olenska and Elliott Dexter as Newland Archer. This film is now lost. 
*In 1928, Margaret Ayer Barnes adapted the novel for the stage. It was produced first on Broadway, where it starred Katharine Cornell as Countess Olenska.
*In 1934, a film adaptation was directed for RKO Studios by Philip Moeller (based on both the novel &quot;and&quot; the play), starring Irene Dunne as Countess Olenska, and John Boles as Archer.
*In 1947, there was a &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; radio adaptation.
*In 1993, Martin Scorsese directed a film adaptation, starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Countess Olenska, Daniel Day-Lewis as Archer, and Winona Ryder as May Welland Archer, with Richard E. Grant and Miriam Margolyes. Ryder earned an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe for her performance, and the film also won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.
*In 2009, an episode of the television teen drama &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; titled &quot;The Age of Dissonance&quot; was broadcast, in which characters put on a production of a play version of &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and find their personal lives mirroring the play. 
*In 2018, a stage adaptation by Douglas McGrath starring Sierra Boggess and Boyd Gaines was produced by The Hartford Stage and McCarter Theatre.
*In 2024, the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, CA, debuted their Globe-commissioned world premiere of a new adaptation.

<text>In mathematics, particularly multivariable calculus, a surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces. It can be thought of as the double integral analogue of the line integral. Given a surface, one may integrate over this surface a scalar field (that is, a function of position which returns a scalar as a value), or a vector field (that is, a function which returns a vector as value). If a region R is not flat, then it is called a &quot;surface&quot; as shown in the illustration.

Surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly in the classical theories of electromagnetism and fluid mechanics. 

== Surface integrals of scalar fields ==
Assume that &quot;f&quot; is a scalar, vector, or tensor field defined on a surface &quot;S&quot;.
To find an explicit formula for the surface integral of &quot;f&quot; over &quot;S&quot;, we need to parameterize &quot;S&quot; by defining a system of curvilinear coordinates on &quot;S&quot;, like the latitude and longitude on a sphere. Let such a parameterization be , where varies in some region in the plane. Then, the surface integral is given by

:formula_1
where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of , and is known as the surface element (which would, for example, yield a smaller value near the poles of a sphere, where the lines of longitude converge more dramatically, and latitudinal coordinates are more compactly spaced). The surface integral can also be expressed in the equivalent form
:formula_2
where is the determinant of the first fundamental form of the surface mapping .

For example, if we want to find the surface area of the graph of some scalar function, say , we have
:formula_3
where . So that formula_4, and formula_5. So,
:formula_6
which is the standard formula for the area of a surface described this way. One can recognize the vector in the second-last line above as the normal vector to the surface.

Because of the presence of the cross product, the above formulas only work for surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space.

This can be seen as integrating a Riemannian volume form on the parameterized surface, where the metric tensor is given by the first fundamental form of the surface.

==Surface integrals of vector fields==

Consider a vector field v on a surface &quot;S&quot;, that is, for each in &quot;S&quot;, v(r) is a vector.

The integral of v on &quot;S&quot; was defined in the previous section. Suppose now that it is desired to integrate only
the normal component of the vector field over the surface, the result being a scalar, usually called the flux passing through the surface. For example, imagine that we have a fluid flowing through &quot;S&quot;, such that v(r) determines the velocity of the fluid at r. The flux is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through &quot;S&quot; per unit time.

This illustration implies that if the vector field is tangent to &quot;S&quot; at each point, then the flux is zero because the fluid just flows in parallel to &quot;S&quot;, and neither in nor out. This also implies that if v does not just flow along &quot;S&quot;, that is, if v has both a tangential and a normal component, then only the normal component contributes to the flux. Based on this reasoning, to find the flux, we need to take the dot product of v with the unit surface normal n to &quot;S&quot; at each point, which will give us a scalar field, and integrate the obtained field as above. In other words, we have to integrate v with respect to the vector surface element formula_7, which is the vector normal to &quot;S&quot; at the given point, whose magnitude is formula_8

We find the formula
:formula_9

The cross product on the right-hand side of this expression is a (not necessarily unital) surface normal determined by the parametrisation.

This formula &quot;defines&quot; the integral on the left (note the dot and the vector notation for the surface element).

We may also interpret this as a special case of integrating 2-forms, where we identify the vector field with a 1-form, and then integrate its Hodge dual over the surface.
This is equivalent to integrating formula_10 over the immersed surface, where formula_11 is the induced volume form on the surface, obtained
by interior multiplication of the Riemannian metric of the ambient space with the outward normal of the surface.

== Surface integrals of differential 2-forms ==
Let
:formula_12
be a differential 2-form defined on a surface &quot;S&quot;, and let

:formula_13

be an orientation preserving parametrization of &quot;S&quot; with formula_14 in &quot;D&quot;. Changing coordinates from formula_15 to formula_16, the differential forms transform as

:formula_17
:formula_18

So formula_19 transforms to formula_20, where formula_21 denotes the determinant of the Jacobian of the transition function from formula_16 to formula_23. The transformation of the other forms are similar.

Then, the surface integral of &quot;f&quot; on &quot;S&quot; is given by

:formula_24

where
:formula_25
is the surface element normal to &quot;S&quot;.

Let us note that the surface integral of this 2-form is the same as the surface integral of the vector field which has as components formula_26, formula_27 and formula_28.

== Theorems involving surface integrals ==
Various useful results for surface integrals can be derived using differential geometry and vector calculus, such as the divergence theorem, magnetic flux, and its generalization, Stokes&#x27; theorem.

== Dependence on parametrization ==
Let us notice that we defined the surface integral by using a parametrization of the surface &quot;S&quot;. We know that a given surface might have several parametrizations. For example, if we move the locations of the North Pole and the South Pole on a sphere, the latitude and longitude change for all the points on the sphere. A natural question is then whether the definition of the surface integral depends on the chosen parametrization. For integrals of scalar fields, the answer to this question is simple; the value of the surface integral will be the same no matter what parametrization one uses.

For integrals of vector fields, things are more complicated because the surface normal is involved. It can be proven that given two parametrizations of the same surface, whose surface normals point in the same direction, one obtains the same value for the surface integral with both parametrizations. If, however, the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions, the value of the surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization. It follows that given a surface, we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization, but, when integrating vector fields, we do need to decide in advance in which direction the normal will point and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction.

Another issue is that sometimes surfaces do not have parametrizations which cover the whole surface. The obvious solution is then to split that surface into several pieces, calculate the surface integral on each piece, and then add them all up. This is indeed how things work, but when integrating vector fields, one needs to again be careful how to choose the normal-pointing vector for each piece of the surface, so that when the pieces are put back together, the results are consistent. For the cylinder, this means that if we decide that for the side region the normal will point out of the body, then for the top and bottom circular parts, the normal must point out of the body too.

Last, there are surfaces which do not admit a surface normal at each point with consistent results (for example, the Möbius strip). If such a surface is split into pieces, on each piece a parametrization and corresponding surface normal is chosen, and the pieces are put back together, we will find that the normal vectors coming from different pieces cannot be reconciled. This means that at some junction between two pieces we will have normal vectors pointing in opposite directions. Such a surface is called non-orientable, and on this kind of surface, one cannot talk about integrating vector fields.

<text>Tolyatti or Togliatti ( , ; , ), known before 1964 as Stavropol, is a city in Samara Oblast, Russia. It is the largest city in Russia which is neither the administrative center of a federal subject, nor the largest city of a subject. Population: The city is best known as the home of Russia&#x27;s largest car manufacturer AvtoVAZ (Lada). For this reason, Tolyatti is often dubbed &quot;Russia&#x27;s motor city&quot; or &quot;Russia&#x27;s Motown&quot; (in reference to Detroit in the United States—the spiritual home of the American automotive industry). It was renamed after Italian communist politician Palmiro Togliatti in 1964.

==History==
Stavropol was founded as a fortress in 1737 by the Russian statesman Vasily Tatishchev. It was often informally referred to as Stavropol-on-Volga to distinguish it from Stavropol, a larger city in southwest Russia, although &quot;Stavropol-on-Volga&quot; was never its official name.

The construction of the Kuybyshev Dam and Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River in the 1950s created the Kuybyshev Reservoir, which flooded the existing location of the city, and it was completely rebuilt on a new site.

In 1964, the city was chosen as the location of the new VAZ automobile plant: a joint venture between Fiat and the Soviet government. It was then renamed Tolyatti after Palmiro Togliatti, the longest-serving secretary of the Italian Communist Party, who had been instrumental in setting up the venture with Fiat. Much of the modern city was constructed in the 1960s to house the workers of the factory, and today AvtoVAZ dominates the economy of the city.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Within the framework of administrative divisions, Tolyatti serves as the administrative center of Stavropolsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Tolyatti—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Tolyatti is incorporated as Tolyatti Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===
For the administrative purposes, the city is divided into three districts:
*Avtozavodsky (), also called Novy Gorod (literally &quot;New City&quot;), is the most modern; it was designed to host the workers of the city&#x27;s AvtoVAZ factory, home of the Lada car;
*Tsentralny (), also called Stary Gorod (lit. &quot;Old City&quot;), home of the city government and industrial center;
*Komsomolsky (), the oldest district, built to house Hydroelectrical Plant builders.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s main claim to fame has been automobiles Lada (Zhiguli) manufactured by AvtoVAZ car plant employing some 110,000 people: in cooperation with Italy&#x27;s Fiat since 1970, with General Motors since 2001 and with the Renault-Nissan Alliance since 2012, and once again becoming an independent, state-owned enterprise in 2022.

Other industries have moved into Tolyatti because it is close to abundant supplies of electricity and water. Petrochemicals are well represented in the city. Among the significant enterprises based there are &quot;TogliattiAzot&quot; (Russia&#x27;s biggest ammonia manufacturer headed by Sergei Makhlai) and &quot;KuibyshevAzot&quot; (a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and Russia&#x27;s biggest caprolactam and polyamide producer). Other industries include building materials production, ship repair and electrical equipment and electronics.

In 2011 the Tolyatti Special Economic Zone was launched in order to develop the region further and diversify the economy of the city. Several auto-component producers (German Mubea and Japanese Sanoh among them) have since been registered, as well as large industrial manufacturers (Praxair and Edscha). By November 2012 the value of project investment totalled 10 billion Rubles and around 3000 jobs were being created.

===Transportation===
The transport system is well developed in the city. Public transport includes municipal buses and trolley-buses, and so-called &quot;alternative&quot; (commercial) transport or marshrutkas.

External transport routes are provided by two bus stations, two railway stations and a city harbour. Tolyatti has its airport as well, but it is used by personal aircraft only (the nearest international airport, Kurumoch, is located 40 km away, towards Samara). The city is linked to the federal road network by the M5 &quot;Ural&quot; highway.

==Culture, education, and sports==

The creation of the Kuybyshev Reservoir in the 1950s destroyed much of the city&#x27;s history, so almost all the city&#x27;s cultural points of interest date from the Soviet period, but the city administration has continued to build new monuments and cathedrals. A recent notable event was the 1998 opening of the large Tatishchev Monument near the Volga. The Transfiguration Cathedral was completed in 2002.

===Education===
Education is represented by over one hundred public and ten private schools, as well as several higher education institutions. Most notable ones include:
*Togliatti State University ()
*Volga Region State University of Service ()
*Tatishchev University of Volga ()
*Togliatti Academy of Management ()
===Museums===
*AvtoVAZ Technical Museum
*Tolyatti museum of local lore

===Sports===
In the eyes of the Soviet leaders, Tolyatti was a perfect Soviet city (since most population migrated here during the construction of AvtoVAZ factories) – many sports facilities appeared so that the &quot;perfect Soviet person&quot; could be healthy. The city has high-quality sports facilities: gymnasiums, swimming pools, ice arenas, association football and racing stadiums — as a result, many athletes, including Olympic Champion Alexei Nemov, Stanley Cup winners Alexei Kovalev and Ilya Bryzgalov had moved to Tolyatti. Former Montreal Canadiens defenseman Alexei Emelin, and former Washington Capitals winger Viktor Kozlov and defenseman Alexei Tezikov were born there. Daria Kasatkina, a professional tennis player, was born there.

Tolyatti is represented in almost every kind of team sports. Tolyatti&#x27;s Lada-sponsored Ice Hockey Club broke the Moscow teams&#x27; domination of the game. The Lada women&#x27;s football team has won the Russian championship several times — and the Lada women&#x27;s handball team, who are the Russian and European Champions, is the core for Russian national women&#x27;s handball. Men&#x27;s football (FC Lada Togliatti), basketball and handball teams also take part in national championships. As for the traditional national sport of Russia, bandy, there is a team founded in 2013, TOAZ, which however only takes part in a recreational league.

Mega-Lada Togliatti who race at the Anatoly Stepanov Stadium are a record 17-times champions of Russia.

===Parks and monuments===

Tolyatti has many parks, and many of these contain monuments of cultural, historical, and aesthetic interest. Examples include Victory Park with its Victory Monument and other monuments, Liberty Square with its Obelisk of Glory and other monuments, Central Park with its &quot;Mourning Angel&quot; (a memorial to victims of Soviet repression), large statue of Lenin, and other monuments, and other parks.

And there are other monuments outside the parks. The City Duma has been energetic in creating or designating historical and cultural monuments, ranging from the colossal equestrian Tatishchev Monument to the tumbledown Repin House and a monument to a faithful dog, and many other types.

==Media==
There are a number of local newspapers published in Tolyatti: &quot;Ploshchad Svobody&quot;, &quot;Tolyattinskoye Obozreniye&quot; (&quot;Tolyatti Observer&quot;), business newspaper &quot;Monday&quot; (&quot;Ponedelnik&quot;), &quot;Volny Gorod&quot;, &quot;Gorodskiye Vedomosti&quot;, and a few others. In the end of the 1990s, &quot;Tolyattinskoye Obozreniye&quot; published a series of articles on a local crime group. The stories drew attention to the group&#x27;s connections with the local police. Subsequently, Togliatti Review saw two of its editors (Valery Ivanov and Alexei Sidorov) killed in 2002–2003.

The only local-born FM-band radio station is at 70.64 and 102.3 MHz.

==Religion==
Tolyatti is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious city. Most religious people in the city are of the Orthodox Christian faith. Muslims are the second largest group of believers. Also in the city are organizations of almost all major religions: Old Believers, Catholics, Jews, Protestants, Buddhists and others.
==Crime==

===October 2007 bomb attack===
During the morning rush hour of 31 October 2007, a bomb exploded on a passenger bus in the city, killing at least eight people and injuring about 50 in what Irina Doroshenko, a spokeswoman for the investigative wing of the local prosecutor&#x27;s office, said could be a terrorist attack. At the beginning of the investigation, it was believed to be the work of terrorists from the North Caucasus. Early reports indicated possible involvement of Chechen terrorist Doku Umarov. However, the officials later named a 21-year-old Evgeny Vakhrushev, who also died in the blast, as the only person to be responsible for the tragedy.

===Organized crime===
The city also has a reputation for gang violence.

===Violent crimes===
The city has witnessed a mafia killing spree: there have been 550 commissioned killings in Tolyatti over 1998–2004, five of those murdered were journalists.

Three chief architects of Tolyatti were victims of violent crimes: Valery Lopatin was shot to death on July 7, 2004, Mikhail Syardin and Aleksander Kiryakov were also injured in violent attacks.

A former city mayor (1994–2000), , was murdered on November 15, 2008.

On December 13, 2008, Anatoly Stepanov, a vice-speaker of Duma of Samara Oblast, a former head of administration of Tsentralny City District of Tolyatti in 1991-1997 and Tolyatti mayor candidate in 2004, was attacked on a street and left with serious head injuries. He died in hospital on February 24, 2009.

===Corruption===
The city&#x27;s mayor in 2000–2007, , was sentenced to seven years in prison on corruption charges.

==Local government==
Mayor Antashev Sergey Alexandrovich was born on December 16, 1959, in the city of Saransk, Mordovia. In 1994 he moved to Tolyatti, was accepted to the post of director of the heating network enterprise of TEVIS. In 2000 he graduated from the International Market Institute with a degree in management. From 2000 to April 9, 2012 - Marketing Director - Energy Sales Director of TEVIS.

<text>Sion () is a Swiss town, a municipality, and the capital of the canton of Valais and of the district of Sion. it had a population of (known as &quot;Sédunois(es)&quot;).

On 17 January 1968, the former municipality of Bramois merged into the municipality of Sion. On 1 January 2013, the former municipality of Salins merged into the municipality of Sion, and on 1 January 2017, Les Agettes did the same.

Landmarks in Sion include the Basilique de Valère and the Château de Tourbillon. Sion has an airfield for civilian and military use, which serves as a base for air rescue missions.

==History==

===Prehistoric settlement===
Sion is one of the most important prehistoric sites in Europe. The alluvial fan of the river Sionne, the rocky slopes above the river and, to a lesser extent, Valeria and Tourbillon hills have been settled nearly continuously since antiquity. The oldest trace of human settlement comes from 6200 BC during the late Mesolithic. Around 5800 BC early Neolithic farmers from the Mediterranean settled in Sion. The settlements remained small until about 4500 BC, during the middle Neolithic, when the number of settlements increased sharply. To support the population increase, farming and grazing spread throughout the valley. They also began burying their dead in Chablandes-type stone burial cists with engraved anthropomorphic stelae. The individual graves changed at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC in large, dry stone wall communal tombs (such as the Dolmen of Le Petit-Chasseur). During the Beaker culture period in the second half of the third Millennium, dolmens were built once again, but they were smaller and had no podium. Stelae continued to be carved, though these were rich with geometric patterns and sometimes built out of old dolmen. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (around 2300 BC) the last stelae were erected.

The early settlements have been well documented. There are huts from the Middle Neolithic period found near Le Petit Chasseur and under Ritz Avenue. Late Neolithic sites have been found at Bramois and the early Early Bronze Age site is at Le Petit Chasseur. The Middle Bronze Age, however, is poorly documented. From the subsequent epochs, the great necropolis of Don Bosco (the &quot;aristocrat&quot; tumulus of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age) and the necropolis of Sous-le-Scex from the La Tène culture.

===Celtic and Roman town===
At the end of the 1st century BC, Sion was the capital of the Seduni, one of the four Celtic tribes of the Valais. Julius Caesar mentions them as &quot;Nantuates Sedunos Veragrosque&quot;. They were conquered by the Romans in the 10s BC. By 8–7 BC, Emperor Augustus praised the tribe (civitas) of the Seduni with an inscription. The town-hall is said to contain several Roman inscriptions, one of which found at Sion commemorates the Roman presence: &quot;Civitas Sedunorum Patrono&quot;. Under the Romans it was known as &quot;Sedunum&quot;.

The Roman settlement stretched mainly from what is now St. Theodul, between the Sionne and to the west side of the hill, Valeria. Under the church, a large bath complex was discovered and partially excavated. Near La Sitterie, Sous-le-Scex and in the upper part of the Avenue du Petit Chasseur, portions of several villae suburbanae were found. In the 1st century AD, the &quot;Claudii Vallensium Forum&quot;, in what is now Martigny, became the capital of the &quot;civitas Vallensium&quot;. Sedunum lost political importance, but still remained the home of many notable families. Grave stelae attest to the presence of &quot;duumviri&quot; (magistrates of the civitas), of &quot;flamines&quot; (priests of the imperial cult), a Roman knight and a former consul in the town. In the 4th century &quot;praesides&quot; (provincial governors) are mentioned living in Sedunum, including a man named Pontius Asclepiodotus, who rebuilt an imperial building and, according to an inscription, converted to Christianity in 377.

===Seat of a Catholic bishop===

The Roman Catholic diocese of Sion is the oldest in Switzerland and one of the oldest north of the Alps. At first, the see was sited at Octodurum, now called Martigny/Martinach. The first authentically historical bishop was Saint Theodore or Theodolus (died 391), who was present at the Council of Aquileia in 381. He founded the Abbey of Saint-Maurice in Agaunum, with a small church in honor of Saint Maurice, martyred there , when he united the local hermits in a common life, thus beginning the Abbey of Saint-Maurice, the oldest north of the Alps. Theodore rebuilt the church at Sion, which had been destroyed by Emperor Maximinus at the beginning of the 4th century. At first the new diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Vienne; later it became suffragan of Tarentaise.

In 589 the bishop, St. Heliodorus, transferred the see to Sion, leaving the low-lying, flood-prone site of Octodurum, where the Drance joins the Rhône. Though frequently the early bishops were also the abbots of Saint-Maurice, the community of canons was jealously watchful that the bishops should not extend their jurisdiction over the abbey. Several of the bishops united both offices: Wilcharius (764–780), previously archbishop of Vienne, whence he had been driven by the Moors; Saint Alteus, who received from the pope a bull of exemption in favor of the abbey (780); Aimo II, son of Count Humbert I of Savoy, who entertained Leo IX at Saint-Maurice in 1049.

The first cathedral probably dates from the 6th century. It was halfway up the hill, where later the church of St. Peter stood, until the 19th century when that church was demolished.

The fortunes of the city grew when the bishop settled there. In 999, King Rodolphe III of Burgundy granted the entire County of Valais to the bishop, and Sion became the capital of this county. The prince-bishop had the rights of high and low justice, the right to his own regalia and to appoint his own vassals. The residents of Sion were ruled by three appointees of the bishop, the &quot;maior&quot;, the &quot;vice dominus&quot; or &quot;Viztum&quot; and the &quot;salterus&quot;.

===Medieval Sion===

As a result of the decline of the feudal social order and thanks to privileges and concessions granted by the bishop, the citizens of Sion had a limited independence in the Middle Ages. A contract between Bishop Kuno and his &quot;maior&quot; William of Turn from 1179, is seen as the first step in the creation of an independent city government. An agreement between the bishop, the collegiate church of St. Viztums and William of Turn in 1217 is the first written charter of freedom for the city. It includes civil and criminal laws and punishments as well as trade and market regulations. In 1269, the burghers of the town had their own council with its own statutes. The council governed the use and management of the common lands through twelve councilors led by the &quot;Viztum&quot;. These administrators later became syndics and were known by this title in 1323. In 1338, the vicar general confirmed the existing rights and freedom of the citizens of Sion in a document. The document was renewed by the bishop in 1339 and was presented to each successive bishop to reconfirm after his election. In the same year, Emperor Louis the Bavarian raised Sion to a free imperial city and collected the surrounding lands into a barony. In 1346, the episcopal Viztum and the citizenry collectively wrote the police regulations. Sion was now a city with city walls, documented freedoms and the market right.

===From the Late Middle Ages to the end of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;===
From the middle of the 14th century to 1475, the history of Sion was filled with wars and destruction. Bishop Witschard Tavel tried to reduce the privileges of the cathedral collegiate chapter and the citizenry with the support of the Count of Savoy. In 1352, Sion was conquered, pillaged and plundered by an army from Savoy. In 1373, the bishop bought back the majority of the fief of Sion from the de Greysier family. Majorie Castle became the bishop&#x27;s residence and the &quot;maior&quot; was now appointed by the bishop every year. Sion was attacked and looted in 1384, again during the Raron affair in 1418 and finally in 1475 during the Burgundian Wars.

During this period, the citizenry strove to defend their acquired privileges and whenever possible to expand those rights. In 1414, the city council approved a new set of statutes for the citizens. In 1433, Bishop Andreas dei Benzi approved a strict set of regulations concerning the granting of citizenship rights to applicants. Two years later, in 1435, he allowed the city council to appoint the bishop&#x27;s representative to Sion. He retained only the right to approve or reject the council&#x27;s choice. In 1560, the citizenry bought the office of &quot;Viztum&quot; from the feudal landholder, the de Chevron family. A year earlier the bishop assigned the office of &quot;salterus&quot; to the citizenry. Thus, by the mid 16th century, the city enjoyed a nearly total autonomy.

In the 16th century, due to a strong immigration from the German-speaking Upper Valais, Sion/Sitten became almost totally German speaking. The town council minutes were written in Latin until 1540, when they changed to German. Official invoices changed to German in 1600.

The 17th and 18th centuries were a peaceful time in Sion. The new city hall was built on Grand-Pont between 1657 and 1665. In 1788, a fire broke out in the city. It damaged Majoria and Tourbillon castles and destroyed 115 of the 284 inhabited houses.

In the High Middle Ages, the residents of Sion were &quot;homines episcopi&quot; or people of the bishop. This was true both for the staff at the court as well as the serfs who tilled the land, and the craftsmen and traders. As the civic community gradually began to organize, they were no longer willing to automatically grant every new arrival the same rights as citizens. Those who were unwilling or unable to purchase citizenship, which cost about 60 shillings in 1326, but wished to live in Sion were classed as permanent residents and their descendants held the same status until they could buy their citizenship. The permanent residents were mainly workers, craftsmen (often originating from the Swiss Confederation and the Germanies) and traders (mostly from Savoy and northern Italy). An outbreak of the plague in 1348 wiped out many citizens. In addition to the citizens&#x27; deaths, the restrictive attitude of the citizenry toward new members led to citizens becoming a minority in Sion. In the first population census in 1610 the town had 1,835 inhabitants, of whom 412 were citizens and 1,423 were permanent residents. In the 18th century, a third category, the tollerati, was added. On the eve of the revolution the city&#x27;s population was 19% citizen, 30% permanent resident and 51% tollerati and other marginalized groups. There were only 41 citizen families, of which twelve were nobility and nine belonged to the patrician class.

Starting in the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century, long-distance trade began to pick up from northern Italy via the Simplon Pass and through the Valais into the Champagne region. Sion became an important relay station on this route. The station at Sion included a &quot;Sust&quot; or warehouse that also provided additional animals to help haul wagons over the pass. Many local nobles and farmers were involved in animal husbandry to support the Sust and pastured their animals, during the summer, in pastures on the other side of the Rhône. The Sust&#x27;s barns are stables were still in operation until the 19th century. Along the river Sionne, there were mills, sawmills and other industries that needed water power. In addition, there were many tanneries in the same area. In 1466, the smiths, bricklayers and stonemasons&#x27; guilds arose from an ecclesiastical fraternity. Those three guilds were followed by the butchers&#x27; guild in 1512, the bakers&#x27; guild in 1525, the tailors and drapers&#x27; guild in 1527 and in 1602 the guild of shoemakers and tanners. These guilds played a major economic role in Sion until the end of the Ancien Régime. The Inn of the White Cross opened in 1550 for merchants and wealthy travelers, followed in 1688 by the inn of the Golden Lion, which was built beside the town hall.

Very little is known about the early churches in Sion since written sources are meager before the 12th century. The predecessor of the present cathedral, the church of Notre-Dame-du-Glarier in the Palacio district served both as the bishop&#x27;s church and the parish church in the 12th century. It was destroyed in the 14th century during one of the wars between the bishop of Sion and the House of Savoy. It was rebuilt in the second half of the 15th century. In the meantime, St. Peter&#x27;s church took over as the bishop&#x27;s and parish church. It was demolished in 1806. The Valeria Church was built in the 11th century and originally consecrated to St. Catherine. This church was probably the first church for the cathedral chapter. St. Theoduls church was first mentioned in the 13th century. It was probably built in 1100 on the ruins of Roman baths and a Carolingian era church. This church was probably built as a grave and pilgrimage church with a shrine in Theodul&#x27;s Crypt. It was destroyed in the wars with the House of Savoy in the 14th century. Construction began on a new church in 1510–1516 under Bishop Matthew Schiner and continued until the 17th century. St. Theodul&#x27;s served the French-speaking urban population as a parish church until 1798. In the 17th century, citizens claimed the right to choose their parish priest, over objections of the ecclesiastical authorities. The dispute eventually required mediation through the Papal Nuncio. The resolution allowed the citizens to choose the pastor from one of four proposed by the archbishop.

In the second half of the 16th century a large Protestant community grew in Sion under the leadership of renowned burghers, who had learned of the new doctrine while students in Bern, Basel, Zürich, Lausanne or Geneva. After 1604, the Valais government had clearly decided to remain part of the old faith. Some individuals or families emigrated to reformed areas, while others went back to the old faith. The Counter-Reformation, led by the Capuchin friars of Savoy and the Jesuits destroyed the last hopes of the Protestants to establish a foothold in the cathedral town. The Capuchins founded a monastery in 1631 and started construction of the monastery church in 1636, and the Jesuits started missionary activity in the 17th century and established a school in 1734.

===From the Helvetic Republic to 1848===

During the anti-patrician unrest in the Lower Valais at the end of the 18th century, Sion remained a bastion of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Les Crochets conspiracy were executed in 1791 in Sion to avoid riots. After the French invasion of Switzerland on 5 March 1798, Sion was caught between the revolutionary spirit of a portion of its population (who established a liberty pole in town on 10 March) and conservative elements who wanted to prevent any change in the Valais. Following the creation of the Helvetic Republic in May 1798, a counter-revolutionary rebellion erupted in the upper Valais. This short-lived rebellion was crushed on 17 May by French and Vaudois troops and Sion was plundered.

Under the Helvetic Republic, Sion was source of conflict between supporters and opponents of the new regime. In May 1799 counter-revolutionary forces from Upper Valais looted the city again. In order to ensure peace in the Valais, the French General Louis Marie Turreau de Garambouville occupied Sion in 1801 and in 1802 Napoleon Bonaparte declared the independent Rhodanic Republic. It then remained independent until 1810 when it was annexed into France as the département of Simplon. Between 1798 and 1801 the representative of the Helvetic government resided in Sion. Under the French occupation, Joseph du Fay de Lavallaz was appointed by the emperor to be the mayor of the district of Sion.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeats during the War of the Sixth Coalition the Valais was occupied by Austria at the end of December 1813. Under the Austrians, the citizenry received many of their rights back. During the following year, the government was split between supporters of the Ancien Régime and the supporters of the independent republic, with each party forming a council. When the two councils combined, the number of Council members was set to 20. Between 1815 and 1839, the patrician class gradually took more and more of the rights and duties of the citizenry back on themselves, gaining more and more power. In response to this, Alexandre de Torrente founded a liberal party in 1830. In the cantonal government, Sion agreed most often with the German-speaking Upper Valais. Which gave the Upper Valais a majority of the Zenden in the council, to the detriment of the French-speaking Lower Valais. However, after the vote on the constitution of 1839, the Upper Valais broke away from the rest of the canton. Sion was chosen as the capital of the Valais, while the breakaway Upper Valais chose Sierre. In 1840, the Upper and Lower Valais were reunited. But four years later, Sion was occupied by Upper Valais troops during the beginning of the Sonderbund War. Federal troops occupied Sion in November 1847.

Sion also bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, which it lost to Salt Lake City, and the 1976 Winter Olympics, which it lost to Denver (the games were reassigned to Innsbruck when Denver residents voted down additional funding). On 10 June 2019, Sion withdrew its bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics after rejection in the referendum.

=== Archaeological findings ===

During the second half of the nineteenth century, the anthropogenic activities had a crucial impact on the Rhône basin. The river was channelized twice in the periods of 1863–1894 and 1930–1960 (the so-called ‘Corrections of the Rhone’, which reduced the length of the river and gave to the river the present-day aspect. In the 2000s, after severe flood events, the ‘Third Correction’ began following the ‘Room-for-River’ flood management strategy and aims to: (1) widen the river, (2) increase the capacity, (3) secure levees and (4) improve the general environmental quality.

<text>The Slackers are an American ska band, formed in Manhattan, New York in 1991. The band&#x27;s sound is a mix of ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub, soul, garage rock, and jazz. The Slackers&#x27; notability is credited to their prolific career, tours of North and South America, Europe, and elsewhere, and signing to notable punk label Hellcat Records.

The members of the Slackers have also been known to perform in other bands and musical projects, including Reggae Workers of the World, David Hillyard &amp; The Rocksteady Seven, Crazy Baldhead Sound System, Da Whole Thing, The Hall Trees, Stubborn All-Stars, and the SKAndalous All Stars. Vic Ruggiero performs as a solo act performing both original compositions as well as reworked Slackers songs, and has also played keyboards and piano on several Rancid albums.

== Career ==

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Redlight&quot;, released on September 23, 1997, was ranked number seven in &quot;Billboard&quot; editor Carrie Bell&#x27;s &quot;The Year in Music (1997)&quot; list. The album&#x27;s track with the same name charted at number 116 on the week of November 10, 1997—the song&#x27;s third week—in CMJ Radio Top 200.

<text>Regnery Publishing is a politically conservative book publisher based in Washington, D.C. The company was founded by Henry Regnery in 1947. In December 2023, Regnery was acquired from Salem Media Group by Skyhorse Publishing, with Skyhorse president Tony Lyons becoming Regnery&#x27;s publisher.

Regnery has published books by Haley Barbour, Ann Coulter, Ted Cruz, Newt Gingrich, Josh Hawley, David Horowitz, Michelle Malkin, Barbara Olson, Sarah Palin, Mike Pence, Robert Spencer, and others.

==History==
===20th century===
Regnery Publishing has existed as a series of companies associated with Henry Regnery. The first, Henry Regnery Company, was founded in Chicago in 1947 and split in 1977, forming Regnery Gateway Inc. and Contemporary Books Inc. Under the leadership of Henry Regnery&#x27;s son, Alfred Regnery, Regnery Gateway became the present-day Regnery Publishing.

After helping to found &quot;Human Events&quot; as a weekly newsletter, Regnery began publishing monthly pamphlets and books. Some of the first pamphlets he published, including a reprint of a speech by University of Chicago president Robert M. Hutchins, criticized the harsh treatment of Germans and Japanese both in popular attitudes and in postwar administration of the former Axis countries.

Regnery published the pamphlets and some books under the name Human Events Associates in 1946. He began publishing under his own name in September 1947. The first book published by the Henry Regnery Company was by socialist Victor Gollancz, who ran the Left Book Club in Great Britain. A man of Jewish heritage, Gollancz was appalled at the bombing of German civilians late in the war and by the treatment of the country afterward. Gollancz published &quot;In Darkest Germany&quot; in Britain but was unable to find an American publisher for his ideas. He approached Regnery, who agreed to publish it. Regnery subsequently published the U.S. edition of &quot;Our Threatened Values&quot; by Gollancz.

Regnery&#x27;s third book was &quot; The Hitler in Our Selves&quot;, by Max Picard. Other early books included &quot;The German Opposition to Hitler&quot; by the German nationalist Hans Rothfels and &quot;The High Cost of Vengeance&quot; (1949) by Freda Utley which was critical of the Allies&#x27; air campaign and post-war occupation. Utley&#x27;s book was the first Regnery book to be reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where it was excoriated. Reinhold Niebuhr gave it a positive review in &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine.

The company was founded as a nonprofit corporation. Regnery later wrote that it was initially organized that way, &quot;not because I had any ideological objection to profits, but because, as it seemed to me then, and does still, in matters of excellence the market is a poor judge. The books that are most needed are often precisely those that will have only a modest sale.&quot; The Internal Revenue Service forced the company to be reorganized as a for-profit concern on March 1, 1948. Regnery hired his first few employees that year.

Regnery published some of the first and most important books of the postwar American conservative movement. &quot;[I]t was a measure of the grip that liberal-minded editors had on American publishing at the time that Regnery, which was founded in 1947, was one of only two houses known to be sympathetic to conservative authors&quot;, according to Henry Regnery&#x27;s 1996 obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In the early 1950s, Regnery published two books by Robert Welch, who went on to found the John Birch Society in 1958. In &quot;May God Forgive Us&quot;, Welch criticized influential foreign-policy analysts and policymakers and accused many of working to further Communism as part of a conspiracy. In 1954, Regnery published Welch&#x27;s biography of John Birch, an American Baptist missionary in China who was killed by Chinese Communists after he became a U.S. intelligence officer in World War II.

In 1951, Regnery published &quot;God and Man at Yale&quot;, the first book written by William F. Buckley, Jr. At that time, Regnery had a close affiliation with the University of Chicago and published classics for the Great Books series at the University, but he lost the contract as a result of publishing Buckley&#x27;s book.

In 1953, Regnery published Russell Kirk&#x27;s work &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot;, a seminal book for post-World War II American conservatism, as well as books by Albert Jay Nock, James J. Kilpatrick, James Burnham and Whittaker Chambers. He also published paperback editions of literary works by authors such as novelist Wyndham Lewis and the poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.

In 1954, Regnery published &quot;McCarthy and His Enemies&quot; by William F. Buckley and L. Brent Bozell Jr. &quot;Although Mr. Buckley [...] had criticized the senator for &#x27;gross exaggerations,&#x27; Mr. McCarthy said he would not dispute the merits of the book with the authors&quot;, according to a news article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. While criticizing McCarthy, the book was sympathetic to him (and in fact was harsher on McCarthy&#x27;s critics than it was on the senator for making false allegations), and McCarthy attended a reception for the authors.

In 1977, the Henry Regnery Company split, with Henry Regnery moving to Washington D.C. to form Regnery Gateway Inc. He took with him many of the Henry Regnery Company&#x27;s rights to political, philosophical, psychological, and religious books along with a few select titles from other genres and the trademark for the Gateway Editions series. The original Henry Regnery Company remained in Chicago and was renamed Contemporary Books. Contemporary was purchased by Tribune Company and merged with Compton&#x27;s Multimedia Publishing Group to form Tribune Education, which was acquired in 2000 by McGraw-Hill.

In the 1980s, Alfred S. Regnery, son of Henry Regnery, took control of Regnery Gateway.

In 1993, the Regnery family sold the publishing company to Phillips Publishing International, which put the book publishing company into its Eagle Publishing subsidiary, which also published the weekly &quot;Human Events&quot;. At that time, Regnery Gateway was renamed Regnery Publishing Inc. Alfred Regnery left his post as president of Regnery Publishing in the 2000s to become the publisher of &quot;The American Spectator&quot; magazine. Alex Novak, son of political columnist Robert Novak, is associate publisher of Regnery&#x27;s history imprint.

===21st century===
One of Regnery&#x27;s publishing lines is the &quot;Politically Incorrect Guide&quot; (P.I.G.) series of books, introduced in 2004 to present conservative views of historical or current events, such as the American Civil War, the British Empire, the Roman Catholic Church, Islam, immigration, and climate change.

In November 2007, Jerome Corsi, Bill Gertz, Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson, Joel Mowbray, and Richard Miniter, five authors whose works had been published by Regnery, filed a lawsuit over royalties claiming that Regnery had been self-dealing by diverting book sales away from retail outlets and to book clubs and other channels owned by Regnery&#x27;s then-parent company, Eagle Publishing. On January 30, 2008, a federal judge dismissed all eight counts of the lawsuit because the authors had signed contracts with Regnery which included a mandatory arbitration clause in their contracts, and three of the authors later sought arbitration (Miniter, Corsi, and Mowbray). In December 2011, the American Arbitration Association released its decision on the arbitration case, ruling in favor of Regnery on all counts.

In January 2014, Regnery was acquired along with other Eagle Publishing properties by Salem Communications.

On July 18, 2018, Simon &amp; Schuster issued a press release announcing an international distribution agreement with Regnery Publishing to begin July 2018. According to the terms of the agreement, Regnery retained responsibility for sales of its titles in the United States while Simon &amp; Schuster began to handle distribution in the United States and both sales and distribution in Canada and export markets around the world.

In 2020, Regnery Publishing published &quot;Irreversible Damage&quot;, a book that endorses the controversial concept of rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD), despite the lack of evidence supporting a diagnosis.

After U.S. Senator Josh Hawley lost a publishing contract with Simon &amp; Schuster in the aftermath of the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol for his role in objecting to the certification of the Electoral College results in the 2020 presidential election, Regnery Publishing said it would publish Hawley&#x27;s book.

In early 2023, Regnery acquired ISI Books, the publishing division of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.

In December 2023, Skyhorse Publishing announced that it was purchasing Regnery, with Skyhorse president Tony Lyons becoming publisher of Regnery. In January 2024, Skyhorse announced the phasing out of Regnery&#x27;s religious imprint, Salem Books, in favor of Skyhorse&#x27;s existing Good Books imprint.

===Reception===
In November 2001, Nicholas Confessore, then a writer for the &quot;American Prospect&quot;, wrote the following about Regnery&#x27;s position in the publishing world:
:Welcome to the world of Regnery Publishing—lifestyle press for conservatives, preferred printer of presidential hopefuls, and venerable publisher of books for the culture wars. Call it—gracelessly but more accurately—a medium-sized, loosely linked network of conservative types, with few degrees of separation and similar political aims. Just don&#x27;t call it a conspiracy.

Some reviewers have criticized the &quot;Politically Incorrect Guide&quot; books for their accuracy. In March 2005, historian David Greenberg wrote that &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History&quot; was &quot;incorrect in more than just its politics&quot; and that &quot;it would be tedious to debunk.&quot;

In August 2006, one critic called &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design&quot; &quot;not only politically incorrect but incorrect in most other ways as well: scientifically, logically, historically, legally, academically, and morally.&quot;

In May 2008, Chris Mooney criticized &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science&quot; as &quot;The Incorrect Guide to Science.&quot; Peter Bacon of &quot;Harvard Political Review&quot; took issue with &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War&quot; for its &quot;cherry-picked research and one-sided judgments of figures.&quot;

<doc id="528882" wikidata="Q7991301" url="?curid=528882" title="What Liberal Media?">
<text>What Liberal Media?: The Truth About Bias and the News is a book by columnist Eric Alterman that challenges the widespread conservative belief in a liberal media bias. Alterman argues that the media, as a whole, is not biased liberally, but conservatively.

==Critical response==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the book, &quot;A well-documented, even-tempered and witty answer, I might say antidote, to such toxic recent bestsellers as Bernard Goldberg&#x27;s &#x27;Bias.&#x27;&quot;

Ted Widmer of the New York Times Book Review said &quot;&#x27;What Liberal Media&#x27; is bold, counterintuitive and cathartic&quot;.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; said of the book, &quot;A polemic is nothing without passion, and Alterman&#x27;s argumentative vigor is engaging [and]... the meticulous care with which his arguments are sourced and footnoted is in commendable contrast to the efforts of some of his more fire-breathing opponents.&quot;

<text>Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is the governing body for cricket in Sri Lanka. It was first registered with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Sports as the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka on 30 June 1975 as a national sports body. The board was renamed in 2003.

The SLC operates all of the Sri Lankan national representative cricket sides, including the Men&#x27;s, Women&#x27;s and Under-19 sides. The SLC is also responsible for organising and hosting Test tours and one day internationals with other nations, and scheduling the home international fixtures.

==History==

Cricket was brought to the nation when it was colonized by the British. As everywhere that the British arrived in numbers, cricket soon followed and it is reasonable to assume that the game was first played on the island by 1800. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was a report in the &quot;Colombo Journal&quot; on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed soon afterwards and matches began in November 1833 when it played against the 97th Regiment.

Throughout the 20th century, the game became increasingly popular in Sri Lanka. It was in the 1975 inaugural Cricket World Cup that they made their international debut. They lost to the West Indies by 9 wickets. They did however turn heads at the same tournament with an excellent display in their match against Australia. The national team won the ICC Trophy in 1979. On 21 July 1981, Sri Lanka was admitted to full membership of the ICC and was awarded Test Match status. The inaugural Test was played at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo in February 1982 against England but Sri Lanka lost by 8 wickets. Sri Lanka won the 1996 Cricket World Cup by defeating Australia. Sri Lanka won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 by defeating India.

In 2023, SLC faced accusations of corruption and declining standards, with Minister for Sports Roshan Ranasinghe having considered its board to be &quot;traitorous and corrupt&quot;. After being eliminated from the 2023 Cricket World Cup, Ranasinghe called for the resignation of the SLC board. On 6 November 2023, after the board&#x27;s secretary Mohan De Silva resigned, Ranasinghe removed the entire SLC board and replaced them with a seven-member interim committee led by Arjuna Ranatunga—captain of Sri Lanka&#x27;s 1996 World Cup team. The next day, in response to a petition by the board&#x27;s president Shammi Silva, the Appeal Court ruled that the previous board was to be reinstated for a period of two weeks pending hearings.

On 10 November 2023, the ICC suspended SLC for failing to meet &quot;the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government interference in the governance, regulation and/or administration&quot;. While the board of the ICC ruled that the suspension would not affect Sri Lanka&#x27;s day-to-day participation in international cricket, the country was stripped of its rights to host the 2024 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. On 28 January 2024, the ICC lifted the suspension, after its board ruled that SLC were no longer in breach of membership obligations.

==Domestic competitions==
Sri Lanka Cricket oversees the progress and handling of the major domestic competitions in the country:
* T10
# Lanka T10
* T20
# Lanka Premier League
*First Class

<doc id="528886" wikidata="Q415150" url="?curid=528886" title="Bifenthrin">
<text>Bifenthrin is a pyrethroid insecticide. It is widely used against ant infestations.

==Chemical properties==
Bifenthrin is poorly soluble in water and often remains in soil. Its residual half-life in soil is between 7 days and 8 months, depending on the soil type, with a low mobility in most soil types. Bifenthrin has the longest known residual time in soil of insecticides currently on the market.
It is a white, waxy solid with a faint sweet smell. It is chemically synthesized in various forms, including powder, granules and pellets. However, it is not naturally occurring.

Like other pyrethroids, bifenthrin is chiral; it has different enantiomers which can have different effects. Bifenthrin is found in two enantiomers: 1S-cis-bifenthrin and 1R-cis-bifenthrin. 1S-cis-Bifenthrin is 3-4 times more toxic to humans than 1R-cis-bifenthrin, while the latter is more than 300 times more effective as a pesticide.

==Toxicity==
===Toxicodynamics===
There are two types of pyrethroids: those with and without α-cyanogroup. The neurotoxicity of bifenthrin is based on the affinity to the voltage-gated sodium channels (in insects as well as mammals). The pyrethroids with an α-cyanogroup block the sodium-channel permanently, causing the membrane to be permanently hyperpolarized. The resting potential will not be restored, and no further action potential can be generated. The pyrethroids without an α-cyanogroup, to which bifenthrin belongs, are only able to bind to the sodium channel transiently. This will result in after potentials and eventual continuous firing of axons. The resting potential is not affected by these pyrethroids.

Bifenthrin will open the sodium channel for a shorter period than other pyrethroids. The mechanism in mammals and invertebrates is not different, but the effect on mammals is much less due to higher body temperature, higher body volume, and lower affinity of bifenthrin to sodium channels.

===Toxicokinetics===
Numerous studies have been conducted on the half life of bifenthrin in soil, water, and air under different conditions, such as aerobic or anaerobic, and at different temperatures and pH. It is more likely to remain in the soil and not so much in water (it is hydrophobic), nor in the air (it is unlikely to volatilize because of its physical properties). Because of the water-insolubility of bifenthrin, it will not rapidly cause contamination of ground water. However, some contamination might occur by soil bound bifenthrin to surface water through runoff. For an overview of the environmental degradation of bifenthrin, see figure below. The main path of degradation results in 4’-hydroxy bifenthrin. 
====Biotransformation====
Pyrethroids are much less toxic in mammals than they are in insects and fish, because mammals have the ability to rapidly break the ester bond in bifenthrin and break the substance into its inactive acid and alcohol components. In humans and rats, bifenthrin is degraded by the cytochrome p450-family.

===Toxicology===
====Toxicity in animals====
;Mosquitoes
Bifenthrin is an effective pesticide to use against malaria and filaria vector mosquitoes. It is still effective when resistance to other pyrethroids is found. Mosquito nets and indoor walls can be treated with bifenthrin to keep more mosquitoes away.
Bifenthrin is an effectively used insecticide, but the risk is high of it working only for a short time. Mosquitoes can develop a resistance to it, as well.

;Aquatic life
Bifenthrin is hardly soluble in water, so nearly all bifenthrin will stay in the sediment, but it is very harmful to aquatic life. Even in small concentrations, fish and other aquatic animals are affected by bifenthrin. One of the reasons for the high sensitivity of fish is fish have a slow metabolism. Bifenthrin will stay longer in the system of the fish. Another reason for the high sensitivity of fish is the effect of bifenthrin as ATPase-inhibitor. The gills need ATP to control the osmotic balance of oxygen. If the fish is no longer capable of taking up oxygen because ATP can no longer be used, the fish will die.
In cold water, bifenthrin is even more dangerous. pH and calcium concentration are also factors that influence the toxicity.
Vertebrates are less sensitive to the effects of bifenthrin as ATPase-inhibitor.

;Bees
In bees, the lethal concentration (LC50) of bifenthrin is about 17 mg/L. At sublethal concentrations, bifenthrin reduces the fecundity of bees, decreases the rate at which bee larvae develop into adults, and increases their immature periods.

;Table of LD50 values
====Toxicity in humans====
Bifenthrin and other synthetic pyrethroids are being used in agriculture in increasing amounts because of the high efficiency of these substances in killing insects, the low toxicity for mammals, and good biodegradability. However, because of its success, they are being used more often (also indoors) and high exposure of bifenthrin to humans can occur.

=====Carcinogenicity=====
The U.S. EPA classified bifenthrin as a Category C, possible human carcinogen. This rating is based on an increased rate of urinary bladder tumors in mice, adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the liver in male mice, and bronchoalveolar adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung in some female mice.

=====Potential for neurotoxicity=====
Bifenthrin can be absorbed by humans either by skin contact or ingestion. Skin contact is not toxic, causing only a slight tingling sensation at the point of contact. Ingestion in concentrations below 10−4 M is not toxic. However, commercially available bifenthrin products formulated for household use (such as Ortho Home Defense Max, sold as a liquid pump spray), can induce toxic effects due to &quot;other&quot; chemicals added to improve the sustainability of bifenthrin or are toxic on their own. Symptoms of excessive exposure are nausea, headaches, hypersensitivity for touch and sound, and irritation of the skin and the eyes.

==Regulation==
The EPA monitors and regulates the use of pesticides in the United States. Because of its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, bifenthrin is classified as a restricted-use pesticide, meaning it may only be sold to certified pesticide applicators. However, the EPA allows lower concentrations of bifenthrin to be sold to the general public.

Bifenthrin has been approved for use against the Rasberry crazy ant in the Houston, Texas, area, under a special &quot;crisis exemption&quot; from the Texas Department of Agriculture and the EPA. The chemical is only approved for use in Texas counties experiencing &quot;confirmed infestations&quot; of the newly imported, invasive ant species.

The EPA has classified bifenthrin as a class C carcinogen, a possible human carcinogen based on a test with mice, which showed increased development of certain tumors.

An acute and chronic reference dose (RfD) for bifenthrin has been established, based on animal studies. The reference dose resembles the estimated quantity of a chemical which a person could be exposed to every day (or a one-time exposure for the acute RfD) without any appreciable risk of adverse health effects. The acute reference dose (RfD) for bifenthrin is 0.328 mg/kg bodyweight/day.
The chronic reference dose (RfD) for bifenthrin is 0.013 mg/kg bodyweight/day.

Bifenthrin was included in a biocide ban proposed by the Swedish Chemicals Agency, because of its carcinogenic effect. This was approved by the European Parliament in 2009.
Pesticides containing bifenthrin were withdrawn from use in the European Union. They have since been reinstated.

Bifenthrin is banned for agricultural use in European union countries since July 2019 but is still approved for the preservation of chopped wood.

==Use==
On a large scale, bifenthrin is often used against invasive red fire ants. It is also effective against aphids, worms, other ants, gnats, moths, beetles, earwigs, grasshoppers, mites, midges, spiders, ticks, yellow jackets, maggots, thrips, caterpillars, flies, fleas, spotted lanternflies and termites. It is mostly used in orchards, nurseries, and homes. In the agricultural sector, it is used in great amounts on certain crops, such as corn. About 70% of all hops and raspberries cultured in the United States are treated with bifenthrin.

Bifenthrin is used by the textile industry to protect woollen products from insect attack. It was introduced as an alternative to permethrin-based agents, due to greater efficacy against keratinophagous insects, better wash-fastness, and lower aquatic toxicity.

===Products===
Products containing bifenthrin include Sevin, Transport, Talstar, Maxxthor, Biforce, Capture, Brigade, Bifenthrine, DuoCide insect control, Ortho Home Defense Max, Bifen XTS, Bifen IT, Bifen L/P, Torant, Zipak, Scotts Turf Builder SummerGuard, Wisdom TC Flowable, FMC 54800, Allectus, Ortho Max Pro and OMS3024 and mega wash from green planet and in Australia, Fortune Ultra, Hovex Ultra Low Odor and Surefire Fivestar.

<text>Raynham Hall is a country house in Norfolk, England. For nearly 400 years it has been the seat of the Townshend family. The hall gave its name to the five estate villages, known as The Raynhams, and is reported to be haunted, providing the scene for possibly the most famous ghost photo of all time, the famous Brown Lady descending the staircase. However, the ghost has been allegedly seen infrequently since the photo was taken. Its most famous resident was Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (1674–1738), leader in the House of Lords.

==Architecture==

Raynham Hall is one of the most splendid of the great houses of Norfolk. After a false start in 1619 and the accumulation on site of a large quantity of Ketton stone in 1621 it was rebegun in 1622, and by the time of Sir Roger Townshend&#x27;s death in 1637 it was substantially complete, though apparently some rooms had not been fitted out, for when the architect Sir Roger Pratt saw it a few years after Townshend&#x27;s death, he recalled later
&quot;Not long after it was built... I was some while in it, while it had no ornament at all... There was somewhat in it divine in the symmetry of proportions of length, height and breadth which was harmonious to the rational soul.&quot;

Whether or not Raynham Hall was &quot;the first of its kind in England&quot; as the genealogist G. E. Cokayne averred, it was certainly &quot;one of the outstanding country houses of the period.&quot; Perhaps because of the three-year grand tour of Europe which Sir Roger had undertaken, accompanied by his mason, William Edge of Raynham, whom he paid in 1620 for twenty-eight weeks accompanying him &quot;in England and out of England&quot;. Raynham was built in an entirely new style, abandoning native tradition and following the Italian form and plan. Except for its hipped roof and Dutch gables, Raynham could easily be mistaken for a house built nearly a century later.

Raynham&#x27;s indications that it may have been influenced by Inigo Jones have superseded earlier optimistic attributions to Jones himself: Sir John Summerson summarized his view of its design, &quot;We do not know who designed it, but may infer that Townshend had the assistance of somebody who had worked in proximity to Inigo Jones, possibly at Newmarket.&quot; Nicholas Cooper finds it &quot;a medley of up-to-date elements, largely Jonesian and derived from London and probably also from the Prince&#x27;s Lodging at Newmarket,&quot; Howard Colvin finds Raynham &quot;a remarkable epitome of motifs that appear in Jones&#x27;s earlier drawings... an intelligent reflection of his style rather than a personal work.&quot;

==Legend==

In 1713, Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, married Robert Walpole&#x27;s prettiest sister, Dorothy. She was his second wife, and is reputed in the gossip of the time to have been previously the mistress of Lord Wharton, &quot;whose character was so infamous, and his lady&#x27;s complaisant subserviency so notorious, that no young woman could be four and twenty hours under their roof with safety to her reputation.&quot; Lady Townshend was buried in 1726. Walpole was Townshend&#x27;s neighbour in Norfolk as well as his brother-in-law, but political and personal rivalry between them was exacerbated by Walpole&#x27;s building of Houghton Hall. As Lord Hervey observed, &quot;Lord Townshend looked upon his own seat at Raynham as the metropolis of Norfolk, and considered every stone that augmented the splendour of Houghton, as a diminution of the grandeur of Raynham.&quot;

==Additions by William Kent==
Later extensions and interiors were designed for the 2nd Viscount Townshend by William Kent, who brought details of its frontispiece on the North Front more closely in line with the manner of Inigo Jones, whose style formed the pattern for Palladianism in Britain. Working at Raynham from 1725 to 1732, Kent added the north wing to Raynham and decorated the interior, where much of Kent&#x27;s finest work can be seen, especially in the elaborately carved architectural chimneypieces, the architectural doorcases and the painted staircase imitating niches and sculpture in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; and the painted ceiling imitating mosaic in the &#x27;Belisarius&#x27; Room. The impressive and beautiful ceiling of the Marble Hall (completed 1730) with its motif of Lord Townshend&#x27;s coat-of-arms was sometimes attributed in the 19th century to Inigo Jones himself. In the State Dining Room Kent introduced a screen in the manner of a Roman triumphal arch that particularly irritated Lord Oxford, who saw it in 1732: &quot;the Arch of Severus, surely a most preposterous thing to introduce a building in a room, which was designed to stand in a street.&quot;

===Paintings===
In spite of a series of 20th-century sales, many fine portraits still adorn Kent&#x27;s splendid rooms at Raynham. Hanging beside his lovely black and white marble chimney-piece in the Princess&#x27; Room is a painting which is believed to be a preliminary sketch for the famous van Dyck portrait &quot;Children of Charles I.&quot; Until 1904, there were many more paintings at Raynham, including several fine family portraits by Kneller and Reynolds. The most famous and valuable was &quot;Belisarius&quot; by Salvator Rosa, which was presented to the 2nd Viscount Townshend by King Frederick William I of Prussia. This was valued at £5,000 in 1804, but was disposed of a hundred years later for £273.

Charles Townshend, 8th Marquess Townshend, is the present owner of the Hall.

<text>This is a list of the leaders of the opposition party of Quebec, Canada since Confederation (1867).

Note that the leader of the opposition is not always the leader of the political party with the second-largest number of seats, in cases where the leader of that party does not have a seat.

There was no leader of the official opposition until March 1869, when the government&#x27;s second budget was introduced.

<doc id="528892" wikidata="Q6296549" url="?curid=528892" title="Journeys of Frodo">
<text>&quot;Journeys of Frodo: An Atlas of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s&quot; The Lord of the Rings by Barbara Strachey is an atlas based on the fictional realm of Middle-earth, which traces the journeys undertaken by the characters in Tolkien&#x27;s epic.

The book comprises 51 two-colour maps (a general map of Middle-earth and 50 numbered maps) at various scales, all based on the original &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; maps drawn by Christopher Tolkien from his father&#x27;s sketches. Each map is on a right-hand page in landscape format and depicts physical features in black and contour lines in red. Routes taken by characters on roads and paths are shown in dashed black and red; routes off-road are in red only. Arrows show the direction of travel and dates are listed in red. Scales along the top and left of each map show the distance east/west (mainly east) and north/south (mainly south) from Bag End. At the bottom of each map is a scale showing miles to the inch and an indication of the lunar phase or phases visible at the dates given.

Each numbered map is accompanied by a description on the facing left-hand page, in which Strachey describes the portion of the route indicated, often justifying her topographical decisions with quotes from the book. In some cases she points out discrepancies in the topographical descriptions, occasionally for instance altering the course of a road or a river on the grounds that it would otherwise be inconsistent with Tolkien&#x27;s other descriptions of the terrain.

==Reception==

Christopher Tolkien refers to &quot;Journeys of Frodo&quot; a number of times in &quot;The History of The Lord of the Rings&quot;, often agreeing with Strachey&#x27;s conclusions, and sometimes disagreeing.

Nancy-Lou Patterson, reviewing the work in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, calls it a &quot;delightful contribution&quot; to the understanding of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, agreeing with Strachey&#x27;s comment that when she first read the novel, she wished she had had &quot;a complete set of maps covering the journeys of Frodo and his companions&quot;. Patterson writes that Strachey&#x27;s maps &quot;with their charming directness and laconic simplicity, come very close to the spirit of Tolkien&#x27;s own line drawings, and form a genuine visual parallel to his novels&quot;.

Ian Lace, reviewing the book for MusicWeb, called the book a remarkable piece of useful Middle-earth/Hobbit scholarship. He writes that Strachey has combined information from the texts, Tolkien&#x27;s maps, and clues such as the phases of the moon.

<doc id="528894" wikidata="Q310158" url="?curid=528894" title="Palmiro Togliatti">
<text>Palmiro Michele Nicola Togliatti (; 26 March 1893 – 21 August 1964) was an Italian politician and statesman, leader of Italy&#x27;s Communist party for nearly forty years, from 1927 until his death. Born into a middle-class family, Togliatti received an education in law at the University of Turin, later served as an officer and was wounded in World War I, and became a tutor. Described as &quot;severe in approach but extremely popular among the Communist base&quot; and &quot;a hero of his time, capable of courageous personal feats&quot;, his supporters gave him the nickname (&quot;the Best&quot;). In 1930, Togliatti renounced Italian citizenship, and he became a citizen of the Soviet Union. Upon his death, Togliatti had a Soviet city named after him. Considered one of the founding fathers of the Italian Republic, he led Italy&#x27;s Communist party from a few thousand members in 1943 to two million members in 1946.

Born in Genoa but culturally formed in Turin during the first decades of the 1900s, when the first Fiat workshops were built and the Italian labour movement began its battles, Togliatti&#x27;s history is linked to that of Lingotto. He helped launch the left-wing weekly &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; in 1919, and he was the editor of &quot;Il Comunista&quot; starting in 1922. He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Italy (&quot;Partito Comunista d&#x27;Italia&quot;, PCd&#x27;I), which was founded as the result of a split from the Italian Socialist Party (&quot;Partito Socialista Italiano&quot;, PSI) in 1921. In 1926, the PCd&#x27;I was made illegal, alongside the other parties, by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government. Togliatti was able to avoid the destiny of many of his fellow party members who were arrested only because he was in Moscow at the time.

From 1927 until his death, Togliatti was the secretary and leader of the Italian Communist Party (&quot;Partito Comunista Italiano&quot;, PCI), except for the period from 1934 to 1938, during which he served as Italian representative to the Communist International, earning the &quot;il giurista del Comintern&quot; (&quot;The Jurist of Comintern&quot;) nickname from Leon Trotsky. After the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943 and the formation of the Cominform in 1947, Togliatti turned down the post of secretary-general, offered to him by Joseph Stalin in 1951, preferring to remain at the head of the PCI, by then the largest communist party in western Europe. His relations to Moscow were a continuing subject of scholarly and political debate after his death.

From 1944 to 1945, Togliatti held the post of Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, and he was appointed Minister of Justice from 1945 to 1946 in the provisional governments that ruled Italy after the fall of Fascism. He was also a member of the Constituent Assembly of Italy. Togliatti inaugurated the PCI&#x27;s peaceful and national road to socialism, or the &quot;Italian Road to Socialism&quot;, the realisation of the communist project through democracy, repudiating the use of violence and applying the Italian Constitution in all its parts (that is, that a Communist government would operate under parliamentary democracy), a strategy that some date back to Antonio Gramsci, and that would since be the leitmotiv of the party&#x27;s history; after his death, it helped to further the trend of Eurocommunism in Western Communist parties. He was the first Italian Communist to appear in television debates. Togliatti survived an assassination attempt in 1948, a car accident in 1950, and he died in 1964 during a holiday in Crimea on the Black Sea.

== Early life and family ==
Togliatti was born in Genoa into a middle-class family, the third son of two elementary school teachers. His father Antonio was also an accountant in the public administration, while his mother Teresa Vitale was a teacher. His father&#x27;s job forced the Togliattis to move frequently to different cities. Before his birth, they moved from Turin to Genoa. He was named Palmiro because he was born on Palm Sunday; Togliatti&#x27;s parents were observant Roman Catholics. Togliatti had one sister, Maria Cristina, and two brothers, Enrico and Eugenio Giuseppe. Eugenio Giuseppe Togliatti became a mathematician and discovered Togliatti surfaces.

=== Education and military service ===
In 1908, Togliatti studied at the Azuni classics high school (classical lyceum) in Sassari, where he was recognised as the best student in the school. After a series of studies concluded with an average of 30, the highest vote, Togliatti graduated in November 1915 with the thesis &quot;Il regime doganale delle colonie&quot; (&quot;The colonial customs regime&quot;), which was discussed with Luigi Einaudi. He also enrolled in the faculty of letters and philosophy. When his father died on 21 January 1911 of cancer, his family ended up in poverty; it was only thanks to a scholarship that Togliatti was able to graduate from the University of Turin with a degree in law in 1917. In 1914, Togliatti had entered politics by joining the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) prior to the First World War, but focused on his studies rather than activism. The war and his political activity prevented him from obtaining a second degree: he dedicated himself to politics in 1923.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Togliatti declared himself in favour Italy&#x27;s intervention on the side of the Entente powers, a minority view among socialists who distinguished, in the words of Battista Santhià, &quot;between the imperialist war and the just national claims against the old imperialisms; they did not consider it right that some Italian provinces should remain under the dominion of a foreign state, moreover a reactionary one.&quot; According to Togliatti&#x27;s brother Eugenio Giuseppe, Togliatti and Antonio Gramsci were &quot;both hypercritical of the government&#x27;s neutralist attitude and harshly anti-Giolittians&quot;.

The precise intellectual path of the young Togliatti is not clear. In the cultural climate of those years, the neo-idealistic and Hegelian currents were prevailing, and they ranged from the teaching of Benedetto Croce to the most exasperated expressions of nationalism and spiritualism. Togliatti would always declare that he remained a stranger to the latter; it is certain that Croce in particular, then &quot;La Voce&quot; of Giuseppe Prezzolini and Giovanni Papini, and Gaetano Salvemini and Romain Rolland had no small part in his youthful formation. The first approach to Marxism would have occurred all through the writings of Antonio Labriola; the decisive elements that led Togliatti to Marxist socialism were his friendship with Gramsci and the concrete social reality of Turin, which saw the development of a strong and organised workers&#x27; movement.

Initially permanently discharged from military service due to physical incapacity (a severe short-sightedness), Togliatti served as a volunteer army officer during the war, and he was later wounded in action and sent home to recuperate. In 1915, he had volunteered for the Red Cross, serving in various hospitals, including at the front. Meanwhile, wartime needs led the military commands to review the enlistment criteria, so he was declared able and enlisted in 1916; he was assigned to the 54th Infantry Regiment and then moved, at his request, to the 2nd Alpini Regiment. In 1917, Togliatti was admitted to the official cadet course in Caserta; he passed it but did not obtain the appointment as an officer due to a serious pleurisy that had occurred in the meantime. He gained the rank of &quot;caporale maggiore&quot; (major corporal) in health care, and he was discharged in December 1918 at the end of a long leave.

=== &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; ===
Returning at the end of the conflict, Togliatti was a part of the group around Gramsci&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; paper in Turin, while working as a tutor. Like the other founders of &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot;, Togliatti was an admirer of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and strongly supported the immediate creation of soviets in Italy. He believed that existing factory councils of workers could be strengthened so that they could become the basis of a communist revolution. Initially, the newspaper, which was founded with union backing, focused on cultural politics. In June 1919, the month following its founding, Gramsci and Togliatti pushed out Angelo Tasca and re-focused as a revolutionary voice. The newspaper reached a circulation of 6,000 by the end of the year and its reputation was heightened by its support of the April 1920 general strike, while the PSI and the affiliated General Confederation of Labour did not support it. On 1 January 1921, the paper began to be published daily.

Like Gramsci, Togliatti took an interest in association football, which was becoming a sport with massive following, and was said to have been a supporter of Juventus, as were other notable communist and left-wing leaders. Allegedly, Togliatti used to ask Pietro Secchia every Monday morning (according to others, the interlocutor was Luigi Longo) what Juventus had done the day before; if the interlocutor did not have an answer, Togliatti was said to reply: &quot;And you, do you expect to make the revolution without knowing the results of Juventus?&quot; Some alleged that &quot;What did Juventus do?&quot; was the first question Togliatti had asked upon awakening after his assassination attempt on 14 July 1948. That same year, he had been pictured at the stadium with Gianni Agnelli.

== Communist Party of Italy ==
Togliatti was a member of the communist faction within the PSI, which was part of the Communist International, commonly known as the Comintern. On 21 January 1921, following a split in the PSI on their 17th Congress in Livorno, he was one of the founders of the Communist Party of Italy (PCd&#x27;I). The PCd&#x27;I was formed by &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; group led by Gramsci and the culturalist faction led by Angelo Tasca.

In the 1921 Italian general election held on 15 May, the PSI suffered losses but remained the largest party, while the PCd&#x27;I achieved 4.6% of the votes and 15 seats. In 1923, some members of the party were arrested and put on trial for alleged conspiracy against the state. This allowed the intense activity of the Comintern to deprive the party&#x27;s left-wing of authority and give control to the minority centre, which had aligned with Moscow. In 1924 and 1925, the Comintern began a campaign of Bolshevisation that forced each party to conform to the discipline and orders of Moscow.

The policy of Bolshevisation moved Gramsci to write a letter in 1926 to the Comintern in which he deplored the opposition led by Leon Trotsky but also underlined some presumed faults of Joseph Stalin. Togliatti, who was in Moscow as a representative of the party, received the letter, opened it, read it, and decided not to deliver it. This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti, one that they never completely resolved. According to the journalists Mario Pendinelli and Marcello Sorgi, Togliatti did this because he was aware that Gramsci&#x27;s hegemony and war of maneuver theories contrasted with Stalin&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist orthodoxy; he kept the letter along with Gramsci&#x27;s &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot; and gave them to a journalist.

=== Fascist regime ===

In October 1922, Benito Mussolini, leader of the National Fascist Party (PNF), took advantage of a general strike by workers and announced his demands to the government to give the PNF political power or face a coup d&#x27;état. With no immediate response, a small number of Italian fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome that was called the March on Rome, and told Italians that they were intending to restore law and order. Mussolini himself did not participate until the very end of the march, with Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio being hailed as leader of the march, until it was revealed that he had been pushed out of a window and severely wounded in a failed assassination attempt. This deprived d&#x27;Annunzio of the possibility of leading the coup orchestrated by an organisation he himself had founded. Under the leadership of Mussolini, the Fascists demanded Luigi Facta&#x27;s resignation as prime minister of Italy and that Mussolini be named prime minister. Although the Italian army was far better armed than the Fascist paramilitaries, the Italian government under Victor Emmanuel III faced a political crisis. The King was forced to choose which of the two rival movements in Italy would form the government: Mussolini&#x27;s Fascists, or the anti-monarchist PSI. He selected the Fascists and appointed Mussolini as the new prime minister.

Initially, Togliatti minimised the dictatorial aspects of the new Fascist government. In the same year, he said: &quot;The fascist government, which is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, will have no interest in getting rid of any of the traditional democratic prejudices.&quot; Upon taking power, attacks by the Blackshirts on communist militants increased, as did their arrests. In August 1923, Mussolini pushed through the Italian Parliament a new electoral law named after its drafter Giacomo Acerbo, the Acerbo Law, which assigned two-thirds of the seats to the list that had exceeded 25% of the votes. Togliatti wrote that &quot;fascism gained power by dispersing the proletarians aggregates, preventing their unification on any terrain, and cause a unification around it in favour of the bourgeois political groups.&quot;

In the 1924 Italian general election, the National List of Mussolini (an alliance with liberals and conservatives) used intimidation tactics, resulting in a landslide victory and a subsequent two-thirds majority, while the CPd&#x27;I gained 3.7% of votes and 19 seats. In January 1926, Togliatti co-authored with Gramsci the thesis of the third congress of the PCd&#x27;I. Later that same year, the party was banned by the Fascist government, and Amedeo Bordiga and Gramsci were arrested and imprisoned on the island of Ustica. Togliatti was one of few leaders not to be arrested, as he was attending a meeting of the Comintern in Moscow. After Gramsci&#x27;s arrest, Togliatti became the leader of the party, which moved to Paris.

In the 1930s, Togliatti was able to survive in the Soviet Union, having renounced Italian citizenship for a Soviet one, despite the Great Purge. While in Moscow, he made an analysis on fascism, including its rise in Italy, and he began to construct a strategy that was based on broad alliances of middle-class categories. His &quot;partito nuovo&quot; (English: New Party), that would come into reality in 1943, had an interclassist dimension and was open to &quot;the demands and mental structures of the middle classes&quot;. During World War II, he broadcast messages of resistance to Italy, and he also tried to appeal to fascist rank and file in order for them to join forces with liberal and left-wing anti-fascist elements.

=== Exile ===
In 1927, Togliatti was elected as the party&#x27;s general-secretary in place of Gramsci. In exile during the late 1920s and the 1930s, he organised clandestine meetings of the party at Lyon (1926) and Cologne (1931). In 1927, he took the position of secretary of the party. In 1935, under the &quot;nom de guerre&quot;, he was named member of the secretariat of the Comintern, and he was later involved in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, he was arrested in France; upon being released, he moved to the Soviet Union and remained there during World War II, broadcasting radio messages on Radio Milano-Libertà to Italy, in which he called for resistance to Nazi Germany and the Italian Social Republic. While in Moscow, he was accused by critics of not doing enough to help fellow communists and others in Fascist Italy. He was aware that the party&#x27;s clandestine organisation and resistance to fascism would not have been possible without Soviet support, and it was for this reason that he flattened to Stalinist positions.

In August 1936, the Comintern published a manifesto, titled &quot;For the Salvation of Italy and the Reconciliation of the Italian People&quot;, which was allegedly written by Togliatti. It was addressed to &quot;the blackshirt brothers&quot; and appealed for unity between Communists and Fascists. It read: &quot;We Communists have made ours the Fascist programme of 1919, which is a programme of peace, liberty and defence of the interests of the workers. ... The Fascist programme of 1919 has not been realised! Let&#x27;s struggle united for the realisation of this programme.&quot; In March 1941, Togliatti told the Comintern that the strength of Fascism lay not only in violence. He said: &quot;This dictatorship has done something – not just by means of violence. It has done something even for the workers and the young. We cannot deny that the introduction of social security is a fact.&quot; Those appeals to fascists were not limited to Togliatti. Giuseppe Di Vittorio wrote a letter to a Fascist union leader. He asked him: &quot;Between communists and fascists in good faith, are there any possibilities of working together, for the well-being of the Italian people and for the progressive march of our country?&quot; The context for those appeals dates back to an August 1936 party meeting in Paris, where Togliatti&#x27;s brother-in-law Mario Montagnana said: &quot;We must have the courage to say that we do not intend to overthrow fascism... we want to improve fascism today because we can&#x27;t do more.&quot; The aforementioned appeal to the Blackshirts was written by Ruggero Grieco, Togliatti&#x27;s successor as party leader during his time at the Comintern, and was published in &quot;Lo Stato Operaio&quot; in August 1936 with the apocryphal signature of Togliatti and all the main Communist leaders. In later years, Togliatti described the manifesto as &quot;a &quot;&quot;&quot;.

At the same time, the party and its militants were actively involved in the resistance to Mussolini&#x27;s regime through clandestine action. They were well prepared for clandestine activity because of the structure of their organisation, and the fact that they had been victims of systematic repression by the authorities; more than three quarters of the political prisoners between 1926 and 1943 were communists. Throughout the dictatorship, the party was able to maintain and feed a clandestine network, distribute propaganda leaflets and newspapers, and infiltrate fascist unions and youth organisations. In 1935, the party led a campaign against the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The party and communist partisans, among others, then went on to play a major role in the Italian resistance movement that led to the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, and Togliatti became a revolutionary constituent and constitutionalist of the Italian Republic, of which he is considered a founding father. In this role he helped shaping a constitutional anti-fascism which called for societal transformations.

On 15 May 1943, the party changed its official name to the Italian Communist Party. This change was not surprising as &quot;PCI&quot; started being used as the party&#x27;s acronym around 1924–1925. This name change also reflected a change in the Comintern&#x27;s role, as it increasingly became a federation of national Communist parties. This trend accelerated after Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s death and its new name emphasised the party&#x27;s shift from an international focus to an Italian one. At the time, it was a hotly contested issue for the two major factions of the party. On one side, the Leninist preferred the single world party as it was internationalist and strongly centralised, while on the other side the Italians wanted a party more tailored to their nation&#x27;s peculiarities and more autonomy. Togliatti returned to Italy in March 1944, after 18 years of exile in Switzerland, France, Soviet Union, and Spain where, with the cover name of Alfredo, he represented the Comintern in the Garibaldi Brigades during the Spanish Civil War.

== Secretary of the Italian Communist Party ==
=== Salerno Turn and national unity governments ===

On 2 April 1944, Togliatti returned from Moscow to Italy, and led the renamed Italian Communist Party (PCI) and other political forces to the &quot;Svolta di Salerno&quot;, variously referred to in English as the Salerno Turn, the Salerno Turning Point, and the U-turn at Salerno, the city where this took place. This was a compromise between anti-fascist parties, the monarchy of Italy, and the then prime minister Pietro Badoglio to set up a government of national unity and to postpone institutional questions. In doing so, he resolved the stall resulted from the Bari&#x27;s congress back in January 1944. Togliatti also founded a political journal, &quot;Rinascita&quot;, following his return to Italy in 1944, which he edited until his death.

With the Salerno Turn, the PCI committed to supporting democracy and to abandon the armed struggle for the cause of socialism. In doing so, the U-turn had the effect to have moved the party to the right, in contrast with many demands from within; it also meant the disarmament of those members of the Italian resistance movement that had been organised by the PCI. During the resistance to fascism, the PCI became increasingly popular, as the majority of partisans were communists. The Garibaldi Brigades, promoted by the PCI, were among the more numerous partisan forces.
Starting with the second Badoglio government, the national unity government including the PCI, Togliatti held several positions in the Italian government. From April 1944 to June 1945, he was both a minister without portfolio and Deputy Prime Minister of Italy under Badoglio (April–December 1944) and Ivanoe Bonomi (December 1944–June 1945). From June 1945 to July 1946, he also served as the Italian Minister of Justice under Ferruccio Parri and Alcide De Gasperi. Adversaries not only on an ideological level, Togliatti and De Gasperi proved skilled mediators in a difficult moment for Italy. As the Italian Minister of Justice, Togliatti&#x27;s pragmatism was put to the test when he approved, not without internal disapproval within the PCI, an amnesty.

The amnesty bearing Togliatti&#x27;s name was controversial because, in addition to partisans, who were in less numbers compared to the fascists and their collaborators in terms of crimes, pardoned and reduced sentences for Italian fascists, excluding the most grave crimes, as well as those committed by high-ranking officials and crimes committed for material gain or carried out with excessive cruelty but did not include rape or sexual torture, which were still pardonable. The amnesty was considered necessary both for the unity of the country and for the rebuilding of the Italian nation after the war.

The result of the final draft for the amnesty law-decree was a compromise between the PCI, which wanted to keep the fascists imprisoned, and the DC, which wanted the fascists pardoned and accepted an amnesty for partisans as the compromise. In practice, the amnesty, which was supported by Allied Force Headquarters in Italy, led to an increase in prosecution of partisan crimes, while fascist crimes were treated more leniently; fascists and their collaborators benefited far more from the amnesty than imprisoned partisans, who were treated as common criminals. Later less publicised pardons and releases on parole between 1947 and 1953, when Togliatti was no longer the Italian Minister of Justice, further reduced sentences for political crimes committed during the war and turned Italy&#x27;s amnesty into an amnesia.

=== Constituent Assembly and 1947 May crisis ===
At the 1946 Italian general election, which was held at the same time (2 June) as the 1946 Italian institutional referendum won by republican supporters, the PCI was the third political force behind the DC and the PSI, and obtained 19% of the votes and 104 seats in the new Constituent Assembly of Italy, where Togliatti was elected as a member. In 2015, historian Giuseppe Vacca recounted the significant role that Togliatti played in the work of the Constituent Assembly. Togliatti was the only Communist leader to participate in the foundation of a democratic republic according to the canons of a European constitutionalism. In the work of defining the republican Constitution of Italy, Togliatti collaborated with the jurist Giuseppe Dossetti.

On 24 September 1946, Togliatti gave a speech at the municipal theater of Reggio Emilia. In this speech, he argued the historical-political reasons that required the construction of a solid relationship with the middle classes. In doing so, Togliatti placed himself in many respects in the tradition of the Italian socialist movement, whose legacy he openly claimed, while at the same time he defined the originality and modernity of the new party with respect to the old reformism in the capacity to go beyond that particularist and classist system that had pushed the PSI to privilege the reasons of the labourers to the detriment of those of the sharecroppers and small owners, which helped to determine a social fracture in which fascism would have entered. According to Togliatti, the relationship with the middle classes was essential, both for the rooting of the PCI and for the realisation of that pact between producers that was at the heart of the economic policy proposal he launched in August 1946 in &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; with an explicit reference to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. This new course and its realisation were considered necessary to permanently overcome the social tensions that had crossed the country and for the success of the Salerno turning point.

In January 1947, Togliatti acknowledged De Gasperi as &quot;the main exponent of the strongest among the popular and democratic parties on which the government will have to be based&quot;. In March 1947, in opposition to the dominant line in his own party, Togliatti voted for the inclusion of the Lateran Pacts in the Constitution of Italy, where it became its Article 7. Togliatti said the vote in favour of his party was more due to political responsibility than personal conviction. Communist ministers were evicted during the May 1947 crisis in both Italy and France after United States involvement. The same month also saw the Portella della Ginestra massacre of communist Sicilian peasants on 1 May. As in Italy, the French Communist Party (PCF) was a major party, taking part in the three-parties alliance known as &quot;Tripartisme&quot;, and became the largest party after scoring 28.3% at the November 1946 French legislative election. As was done by the United States in Italy, Maurice Thorez, head of the PCF, was forced to quit Paul Ramadier&#x27;s government along with the four other party ministers. The crisis contributed to the start of the Cold War in western Europe. Under Togliatti, the PCI became the largest Communist party in western Europe.

=== Popular Democratic Front and assassination attempt ===
In his 26 September 1947 speech at the Constituent Assembly calling for his vote of no confidence in the fourth De Gasperi government, Togliatti said: &quot;Our goal is the creation in our country of a free and equal society, in which there is no exploitation by men of other men.&quot; In 1948, Togliatti led the PCI in the first democratic election after World War II. The 1948 Italian general election resulted in a loss to Christian Democracy (&quot;Democrazia Cristiana&quot;, DC) Allied with the PSI in the Popular Democratic Front, the coalition achieved 31% of the votes, and the PCI returned 131 deputies to Parliament. Togliatti himself was elected to the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies.

On 14 July 1948, at about 11:40 am, Togliatti was shot three times, being severely wounded by Antonio Pallante, a neo-fascist student, who had strong anti-communist views and was a militant of the Common Man&#x27;s Front. Togliatti&#x27;s life hung in the balance for days and news about his condition was uncertain, causing an acute political crisis in Italy, with civil war and insurrection implications, which included a general strike called by the Italian General Confederation of Labour, as well as portraits of Togliatti being brought in during the celebration of the storming of the Bastille and a telegram from Stalin. Upon regaining consciousness, Togliatti himself was instrumental in calling for calm and a return to normalcy; from his hospital bed, he reassured his comrades and tried to pacify spirits, averting the danger of an armed insurrection. He preferred the &quot;Italian Road to Socialism&quot; over a violent revolution, and rejected the concept of an internationally directed movement in favour of one that was both democratically and nationally oriented. Historian Sergio Turone described it as &quot;the most complete and most extensive general strike ever in the history of Italy&quot;. In January 2023, it was publicly revealed that Pallante had died on 6 July 2022, aged 98, and that he never regretted the shooting.

=== 1950s and 1960s ===

On 22 August 1950, a car accident caused Togliatti to crack the frontal bone and fracture a vertebra. As with the 1948 assassination attempt, the event caused an international sensation, and was followed by an investigation, which blamed the accident on &quot;the unacceptable levity of fellow driver Aldo Zaia&quot;. At the time, no one was aware that in October 1950 he had lost consciousness and went into a coma; his doctor suspected that Togliatti had been poisoned. Togliatti was saved by brain surgery. During his period of convalescence in a Piedmontese clinic, it was reported that Togliatti had played chess with the Italian senator and fellow party member Cino Moscatelli. In December 1951, within the context of the birth of the Gladio anti-communist organisation, spy microphones were set up in Togliatti&#x27;s house by the head of the Supervisory Commission, and were intended to also monitor his partner, Nilde Iotti, who was suspected of being in contact with Vatican circles.

Under Togliatti&#x27;s leadership, the PCI became the second largest party in Italy and the largest non-ruling Communist party in Europe. Although permanently in the opposition at the national level during his lifetime, the party ran many municipalities and held great power at the local and regional level in certain areas. In 1953, Togliatti fought against the Scam Law, an electoral legislation passed by the DC-led majority of the time, which aimed at using first-past-the-post to augment its power. Ultimately, the law was to prove of no use for the government in the elections of that year, where the PCI won 22.6% of the vote and confirmed itself as the first party within the parliamentary opposition and the second biggest party after the DC. It was repealed in July 1954.

Togliatti was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and he remained a member of Parliament until his death in 1964. Despite his close relationship with the Soviet Union, Togliatti&#x27;s leadership remained unscathed after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, which was in most countries a cause for major conflicts within the political left. He developed a theory of unity in diversity within the Communist parties in all countries, which he outlined in a &quot;Rinascita&quot; article in December 1961, and named .

=== &quot;Italian Road to Socialism&quot; ===
After the Khrushchev Thaw in the Soviet Union, Togliatti was inspired by the new set of reforms and launched the party program of the &quot;Italian Road to Socialism&quot;. He said: &quot;We are democrats in that we are not only anti-fascists, but socialists and communists. There is no contradiction between democracy and socialism.&quot; The new policy proposed by Togliatti was opposed to any revolutionary means of gaining power and aimed at accompanying institutional action with the extension of social and trade union struggles, and supported the concept of peaceful coexistence. During this period, the PCI purged revolutionary and extremist factions opposed to the new openly reformist line. On 15 February 1956, &quot;Il Nuovo Corriere della Sera&quot; published on the front page a correspondence by Piero Ottone on the five-hour speech with which Khrushchev the previous day explained to the 1,400 Soviet delegates and the leaders of international Communism, including Togliatti and Mauro Scoccimarro, the new strategies of communism. The main points of Khrushchev&#x27;s speech were the peaceful coexistence between the blocs, the prevention of war, and the forms of transition of the various countries to socialism that, in the words of Ottone, means &quot;the forces of socialism can assert themselves without revolutions, without civil wars, through parliamentary processes&quot;, akin to Togliatti&#x27;s &quot;Italian Way to Socialism&quot; that was first inaugurated with the Salerno turning point and that he reiterated in his speech of response.

In the 1958 Italian general election, the number of votes for the PCI was still on the rise. In the 1963 Italian general election, the PCI gained 25.2% of the votes but again failed to reach a relative majority. Nonetheless, the 1963 election ended the Centrism party system and resulted in the first centre-left government in the history of the Italian Republic, with the PCI giving its first external support, a system of government known as the Organic centre-left. In 1961, Togliatti said: &quot;We are a party that is on the side of those who fight in defense of their freedom.&quot; During the early 1960s, Togliatti appealed to the Catholic world. In a 1963 speech in Bergamo, titled &quot;The Destiny of Man&quot;, he called for a common front between the religious and communists against consumerism and the commodification of life, and that this opposition must act as a bridge between them. In August 1964, Togliatti went to the Soviet Union and wrote the Yalta Memorandum. Published after his death, Togliatti&#x27;s memorandum that outlined his political doctrine strengthened the trend toward liberalisation within the international Communist movement and Communist governments. Additionally, he made various criticisms of the Soviet leadership, including the perceived slowness with which it was leaving behind the Stalinist legacy. The historian Giuseppe Vacca saw the memorandum as a generalised critique of the Soviet system.

== Personal life ==
From 1924 to 1948, Togliatti was married to fellow party member and politician Rita Montagnana. Until his death, he was in a relationship with Nilde Iotti, also a fellow party member and politician. This relationship was controversial due to the fact that he was already married and the moralistic austerity that distinguished the PCI at the time. Iotti would become the first woman in the history of the Italian Republic to hold by the end of the 1970s one of the three highest offices of the state, namely the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies. Togliatti was a supporter of women&#x27;s rights, with the &quot;Noi donne&quot; feminist magazine describing him at his death as &quot;a great supporter of women&#x27;s emancipation&quot;.

== Death and funeral ==

Togliatti died as a result of a cerebral haemorrhage, while vacationing with his companion Nilde Iotti in Yalta, then in the Soviet Union. The day before, he had been urgently hospitalised as a result of a stroke, for which he underwent surgery; he was 71. According to some of his collaborators, Togliatti was traveling to the Soviet Union to give his support to Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s election as Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s successor at the head of Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Enrico Berlinguer, his favourite pupil, was later elected as his successor to the National Secretary of the PCI position; Berlinguer&#x27;s time in office saw the Historic Compromise and the moral question. The news of Togliatti&#x27;s death was first given by the country&#x27;s leading agency ANSA. The party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; described him as &quot;a great son of the Italian people, a brilliant leader of international communism, a fighter who spent his whole life in a hard and tireless struggle for socialism, for democracy, for peace.&quot;

The Soviet Russian city of Stavropol-on-Volga, where Togliatti had been instrumental in establishing the AutoVAZ (Russian: &quot;Lada&quot;) automobile manufacturing plant in collaboration with Fiat, was renamed after him (in Russian: &quot;Tolyatti&quot;) in his honor in 1964, after his death. One of the main town squares in the Croatian city of Rijeka (Italian: &quot;Fiume&quot;) was named after Togliatti while Croatia was part of SFR Yugoslavia, until it was renamed to &quot;Jadranski trg&quot; (Adriatic Plaza) in 1994. There is still a street in Belgrade named after him (Serbian: &quot;ulica Palmira Toljatija&quot;). Togliatti&#x27;s funeral, held on 24 August 1964, was attended by a million and saw much popular participation, comparable to that of Berlinguer years later; about 500,000 people followed Togliatti&#x27;s coffin making its way in Rome.

A 1972 painting by Renato Guttuso, titled &quot;I funerali di Togliatti&quot;, was made to recreate the event. The painting includes, in addition to Iotti, Brezhnev, and Berlinguer, notable global Communist movement figures and others whom Guttuso imagines being present at the funeral, such as Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Elio Vittorini, Angela Davis, Antonio Gramsci, Dolores Ibárruri, Anna Kuliscioff, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Curzio Malaparte described Togliatti as the thinking head of Italian Communism.

== Legacy ==
The Salerno Turn anticipated the &quot;Italian Way to Socialism&quot; and the Eurocommunist trend. While its motives have been widely discussed and argued about by scholars, the national peculiarity of the PCI is not limited to Togliatti and is well-founded by the fact that it was a co-founder of the Italian Republic and its constitution, as well as its significant contribution to the resistance against Nazi–fascism and its mass base. The PCI under Togliatti and their attitude towards the Marshall Plan is placed within the context of the Cold War and anti-communism. After orchestrating the fall of the PCI and PSI from government, amid a crisis within the DC and fears that a left-wing coalition would take power, the United States and George Marshall had informed the Italian government that anti-communism was a pre-condition for receiving American aid, and James Clement Dunn had directly asked Alcide de Gasperi to dissolve the parliament and remove the PCI. Additionally, the United States provided support to anti-PCI groups in 1948, and reiterated that should the PCI win, the Marshall Plan and other aids could be terminated. According to one estimate, the United States spent about $10–20 million on anti-communist propaganda and other covert operations, much of it through the Economic Cooperation Administration of the Marshall Plan, and then laundered through individual banks. Fearful of a possible electoral victory for a left-wing coalition, the British and American governments also undermined their campaign for legal justice by tolerating the efforts made by Italy&#x27;s top authorities to prevent any of the alleged Italian war criminals from being extradited and taken to court. For their part, the Soviets would fund the PCI until 1984, and the party relied on Soviet financial assistance more than any other Communist party supported by Moscow. United States and Soviet interference and funding led to criticism of the other and accusing each other of going too far. United States government sources said that the PCI was receiving $40–50 million per year from the Soviets when their investment in Italy was stated to be $5–6 million; declassified information showed this to be exaggerated.

Liberal and left-wing critics saw Togliatti&#x27;s policy of the Salerno Turn as an example of frontism, or common front, that was orchestrated by Stalin to conform to his deals with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In contrast to the long-time held historiography of the PCI, Elena Agarossi and Victor Zaslavsky argue in a revisionist account that Togliatti and the other leaders of the PCI were fundamentally subservient to Stalin, and did their best to promote Soviet interests. They argue that Togliatti was above all a Stalinist, and that he remained one for years after Stalin died in 1953 and the Soviet Union had repudiated much of his legacy. They argue that it was Stalin who ordered Togliatti to play a moderating role in Italian politics because the time was not yet ripe for a showdown with capitalism. Agarossi and Zaslavsky rely not only on Togliatti&#x27;s papers but those of the Kremlin, especially the highly detailed reports sent in by the Soviet ambassador in Rome. Stalin forced the PCI to reject and work against the Marshall Plan, despite the loss of much support from Italian voters who wanted the American aid. First published in 1997, this view was criticised by Luciano Canfora. Canfora saw the Salerno Turn and 1944 as a rebirth of Italy&#x27;s Communist party, and said that &quot;the PCI had gradually followed a path which required it, as a historical task, to occupy the space of social democracy in the Italian political panorama.&quot; In the words of Franco Lo Piparo, Togliatti&#x27;s &quot;Italian Road to Socialism&quot; entailed &quot;social democracy using communist rhetoric&quot;.

In February 1992, during the electoral campaign for the imminent general election, the historian Franco Andreucci published an incomplete and manipulated version in the weekly news magazine &quot;Panorama&quot;, the excerpt of a holographic letter from Togliatti (then known as Ercoli, a Soviet citizen since 1930, member of the military commission of the executive committee of the Comintern) from the Moscow archives, in a correspondence sent from Ufa on 15 February 1943 and written in response to a letter from the PCI leader Vincenzo Bianco who asked Togliatti to intercede with the Soviet authorities to avoid death of prisoners of the Italian Army in Russia. The manipulation of some words and phrases of the text in the letter reported in the weekly was discovered only ten days later. Andreucci had corrected a photocopy that came badly and in part incomplete given to him by the historian Friedrich Firsov, dictating it via telephone to the director of &quot;Panorama&quot; from home of the journalist Francesco Bigazzi, correspondent in Moscow for the newspaper &quot;il Giorno&quot;, as a result of which he had to resign from the position of consultant held at the publishing house Il Ponte alle Grazie, which, due to the loss of credibility suffered, soon suffered a collapse in sales and was absorbed in 1993 by Edizioni Salani. The political result of the operation was partially achieved, as the attack on Togliatti, in addition to influencing the result of the 1992 Italian general election, also served to put Iotti out of the running from a possible election to the presidency of the Italian Republic.

<text>Ailsa Craig (; ; ) is an island of in the outer Firth of Clyde, west of mainland Scotland, upon which microgranite has long been quarried to make curling stones. The now-uninhabited island comprises the remains of a magmatic pluton formed during the same period of igneous activity as magmatic rocks on the nearby Isle of Arran.

The island, colloquially known as &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Milestone&quot;, was a haven for Catholics during the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, but is today a bird sanctuary, providing a home for huge numbers of gannets and an increasing number of puffins.

==Etymology==
An early reference to the rock is made by Sir Donald Monro, Archdeacon of the Isles, who referred to the rock as &quot;Elsay&quot; in the 16th century. The modern name of the island is an anglicisation of the Gaelic, &quot;Aillse Creag&quot; meaning &quot;fairy rock&quot;. An alternative Gaelic name is &quot;Creag Ealasaid&quot; meaning &quot;Elizabeth&#x27;s rock&quot;. The first element, &quot;Aillse&quot; may represent &quot;Allt Shasann&quot;, &quot;cliff of the English&quot;, mentioned in the &quot;Book of Leinster&quot; as &quot;Aldasain&quot;.

The island is sometimes known as &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Milestone&quot;, being approximately the halfway point of the sea journey from Belfast to Glasgow, a traditional route of emigration for many Irish labourers going to Scotland to seek work.

As a result of being the most conspicuous landmark in the channel between Ireland and Scotland, the island is known by a number of different names;
*&quot;A&#x27; Chreag&quot;: &quot;the rock&quot;
*&quot;Creag Alasdair&quot;: &quot;Alasdair&#x27;s rock&quot;
*&quot;Ealasaid a&#x27; Chuain&quot;: &quot;Elizabeth of the ocean&quot;
*&quot;Alasan&quot;
*&quot;Carraig Alasdair&quot;: &quot;Alasdair&#x27;s Rock&quot; (used in the &quot;Madness of Sweeney&quot;, the tale of a legendary king of Ireland).

The Bass Rock is sometimes nicknamed &quot;the Ailsa Craig of the East&quot;, although its prominence in the Firth of Forth is not as great as that of Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde.

===Placenames===
A number of features and places on the island have acquired names, Gaelic in most cases, such as Craigna&#x27;an (cliff of birds); Trammins (place of Elder trees); Balvar (big round cliff); Garryloo (rough hill) and Ashydoo (black hill). Some names seem self-explanatory and indeed even the &#x27;Swine Cave&#x27; may refer to a time when the Earl of Cassilis received part of his rent in hogs from the island.

==Geography and geology==

The island is approximately west of Girvan; it is in circumference and rises to a height of . The island is part of the administrative district of South Ayrshire, in the ancient parish of Dailly.

Geologically, Ailsa Craig comprises the remains of a Palaeogene pluton. Its prominence is due to the microgranite&#x27;s hardness, making it more resistant to erosion than the surrounding Permian and Triassic sedimentary rocks into which it was intruded. The microgranite is itself intruded by a series of olivine dolerite dykes. Ailsa Craig, along with neighbouring Arran, is part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province, a widespread system of magmatic rocks formed during the initial stages of the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean. Boulders of distinctive Ailsa Craig microgranite known as erratics were transported by glaciers as far afield as County Donegal and Pembrokeshire.

The microgranite&#x27;s unusual composition and crystalline texture make it particularly hard and resistant to impact, making this rock a favoured material for the manufacture of curling stones. The &quot;blue hone&quot; variety is now used for the lower part of the stone which contacts the ice (the running band) while the &quot;common green&quot; variety is used to make the body of the stone (including the striking band). A third variety, &quot;red hone&quot;, is similar to blue hone but has now been exhausted.

==Facilities==
The only surviving buildings on the island are the lighthouse on its east coast facing the Scottish mainland, a ruined towerhouse built by Clan Hamilton to protect the area from Philip II of Spain in the 16th century, and the old quarry manager&#x27;s house that is used by the RSPB.
The island has a fresh-water spring but no electricity, gas, sewage or telephone connections. 

The chief well on the island lies above &#x27;the Loups&#x27;, and this was used by the Northern Lighthouse Board which built a cistern there and piped the water to the lighthouse complex. The &#x27;Horse Well&#x27; was located behind the gasworks; the &#x27;Castle Well&#x27; stands above Ailsa Castle, and finally the Garry Loch sits higher up and once supplied water to the tenant&#x27;s cottage.

Fishermen seem to have used the island for centuries, first being noted in 1549 and it is recorded that they even at one time slept beneath sails stretched over hollows on the beach.

A row of fishermen&#x27;s cottages was under construction in the 1840s. However, the main developer died, and the project was abandoned, with the area used instead as a walled kitchen garden until the gasworks was built.

==Owners==
The island seems to have been a part of the Barony of Knockgarron that lay in the Parish of Dailly and the then holder, Duncan of Turnberry, Earl of Carrick established the abbey of Crossraguel and endowed it with the island of Ailsa Craig to &quot;provide for their table&quot;. The barony passed through several hands until it became the property of the third Earl of Cassilis in 1548.

Apart from sold to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1883, since the 16th century the island has belonged to the Earls of Cassilis. In 1831, Archibald Kennedy, 12th Earl of Cassilis, was created the first Marquess of Ailsa, taking the title from Ailsa Craig.

In May 2011, it was announced that the island was for sale by Charles Kennedy, 8th Marquess of Ailsa, with an asking price of £2,500,000, but as of March 2013 it was unsold and the price was &quot;offers over £1,500,000&quot;. It was reported in December 2013 that an unnamed environmental trust had placed a formal bid, and in April 2014 the National Trust for Scotland was reported to be considering a bid. As of 2020, the island was still owned by David Kennedy, 9th Marquess of Ailsa and was leased by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds until 2050.

Four cottages, a shed, a railway, a winch house, the main pier, and an area of adjacent land are now in the ownership of the Scottish Indian businessman Bobby Sandhu. Mr Sandhu purchased this registered title buildings and land for £85,000 from the Argyll Group plc. Mr Sandhu stated he wished to build a five-star hotel on the land (Title: AYR24617). However, the planning system apparently prevented this development.

==History==
In 1590 the shipping of the Clyde was disrupted by pirates who were said to be Highlanders, .

Margaret Girvan ran a tearoom in a wooden building that stood next to the tacksman&#x27;s cottage, famed for its pristine white table cloths and fresh scones. Girvan kept goats in stone-built goat rees or pens on the good grazing near Garry Loch. The feral billy goats were wont to interfere with these nanny goats and this was another reason for their demise.

An annual hunt of the solan geese or gannets took place in the days of Robert Burns as the flesh was considered a delicacy. Robert Burns&#x27;s maternal uncle Samuel Burns was involved in the solan goose trade.

===Ailsa Castle===
The high ruins of a 3-storey castle that stands on the eastern side of the island was built in the late 1500s by the Hamilton Family to protect the island from King Philip II of Spain. The island was used as a prison during the 18th and 19th centuries. The castle has two vaulted storeys and an oven is located in a cellar with evidence of a spiral stairway that once ran to the top of the tower. Three cinquefoils arranged in a &#x27;V&#x27; shape are carved on the tower and indicate that the Hamiltons were linked with the structure. There are indications of an adjoining building that ran to the north.

===Spanish invasion===
Ailsa Craig was a haven for Roman Catholics during the Scottish Reformation. In about 1587 the prominent Catholic, Lord Maxwell, landed on Ailsa while attempting to escape his pursuers and finding a fishing boat he attempted to reach Crossraguel Abbey, but was captured. In 1597 another Catholic supporter, Hugh Barclay of Ladyland, took possession of Ailsa Craig which he was intent on using as a place of safety for Catholics to practise their faith, for provisioning and stopping off point for a Spanish invasion which would re-establish the Catholic faith in Scotland and a storehouse for provisioning the Catholic Earl of Tyrone in Ireland.

Hugh was however discovered by The Rev. Andrew Knox, a Protestant minister (who later became both Lord Bishop of the Isles and Lord Bishop of Raphoe). Barclay thereafter deliberately drowned himself in the sea or did so accidentally whilst trying to escape.
Another version states that Andrew Knox lay in wait for Hugh with nineteen others and ambushed him at the shingle beach with the result that he attempted to defend himself until he was forced back into the sea and drowned.

===Smuggling===
Beneath the Main Craig at the southern end of the island and above sea level is a cave named after the supposed smuggler MacNall. When the cave was being cleared of guano many years ago, two stone coffins were found, both containing human bones. The Rev. Roderick Lawson (1831–1907) thought that one of the interments might be MacNall himself, but no details of this individual have yet come to light. Ailsa Craig would have been an ideal place for the temporary hiding of contraband goods.

===Chapels===
The island had two chapels and Thomas Pennant who visited Ailsa Craig in 1772 recorded that the ruins of a small chapel were located near the landing place and that another chapel (which he did not visit) was located on the summit of the island and was probably used by seamen to pray for safe voyages and returns. Lawson sees this second chapel as being a myth. When the lighthouse was being constructed, four stone coffins were found that may well have been associated with the first mentioned chapel, two at the tenant&#x27;s house and two at the gasholder site. The monks of Crossraguel Abbey once held the island and &quot;places of prayer&quot; are therefore to be expected especially with a garrisoned castle nearby; it is to be noted that even the diminutive Lady Isle off Troon once had a chapel. The chapel was first mentioned, along with the castle, in 1580 by Sir James Balfour.

===Lighthouse, foghorns and gas works===
The Lighthouse was built between 1883 and 1886 by Thomas Stevenson; it is owned by the Northern Lighthouse Board.

The lighthouse was automated in 1990 and converted to solar electric power in 2001; the island has been uninhabited since automation in 1990. Ailsa Craig and its lighthouse feature extensively in Peter Hill&#x27;s book &quot;Stargazing: Memoirs of a Young Lighthouse Keeper.&quot;

Two substantial foghorns with concrete housings were built in 1866, one at the north end of the island near the Swine Cave reached by &#x27;the Loups&#x27; path and the other at East Trammins on the south end. Both were powered by compressed air that was piped from the lighthouse, where a gas-powered compressor was housed until 1911 when oil-powered engines were installed. One of the compressed air pipelines can still be seen within &#x27;the Loups&#x27; path that was constructed above it. The compressed air cylinders that held the required store of air are still prominent features, especially at the Trammins foghorn. Both foghorns were decommissioned in 1966 and a Tyfon fog signal was used until 1987 when improvements in ship navigation made it also redundant.

The gasworks are still a prominent feature on the island and the cable-powered tramway was partly built to haul wagons full of coal up to it from the North Port. Two gasholders held the coal gas that powered both the compressed air pump and the lighthouse light, however in 1911 the light was converted to incandescent lighting which was powered by electricity. The gas works became redundant at this time. Lawson records that oil was used to produce the gas for the lighthouse light.

===Railways===

Ailsa Craig had two quite separate rail transport systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, oil fuel and provisions to the lighthouse and gas works via the North Port and later the New Jetty and the other transported road stone from the quarries at Kennedy&#x27;s Nags via the stone crusher to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board&#x27;s tramway had a section worked via a powered cableway that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the new jetty.

This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 914 mm (3 ft) with junction/points at the gas works and a further set of points that led to a siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the gas works to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs on down to the lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to the southern end of the lighthouse buildings block. This section of the line was worked by hand and at least two wagons remain at the site together with a set of spare wheels at the gas works.
The mineral line was built by the Ailsa Craig Granite Company Ltd. in 1909 and ran from the quarry at Kennedy&#x27;s Nags via the stone crusher near the south foghorn to the Quarry Pier. This crudely constructed narrow gauge line was mainly horse drawn, although wagons were also moved by hand or hauled up inclines by winding engines. The mineral railway at the quarry end had a least one siding and a mobile steam crane loaded the larger granite blocks into the wagons that were transported to the stone crusher at the Trammins near the south foghorn, smaller stones being loaded and even moved by hand.

Wagons or bogies were winched up to the substantial stone crusher and gravity was used to deliver the different grades of road stone to the waggons below that were then hauled by horses to the Quarry Pier via a line that ran in front of the lighthouse buildings and took a tight right-angled bend to run up the substantial stone-built incline to the storage area in preparation for delivery via sea to the mainland. Kerb stones and stone railway sleepers for sections of the Scotch gauge horse-drawn railway from Ardrossan to Doura were also produced.

Photographs taken in the late 19th century show the horse-drawn wagons passing in front of the lighthouse and portray the substantial railway incline and storage area. At times the production outstripped the storage capacity and a photograph shows at least three piles of different grades of road stone stockpiled in front of the lighthouse enclosure. The track at the crusher had a siding that ran to the crusher and a set of points that led to the Quarry Pier main line.

The Ailsa Craig Granite Company was never a financially sound business and effectively closed in 1928. The course of the mineral line is still evident near the quarries as a linear embankment that ends below Kennedy&#x27;s Nag. Various artefacts of the quarry enterprise remain, including concrete blocks at Kennedy&#x27;s Nag and steel and concrete remnants of the stone crusher near the south foghorn.

== Curling stones ==
From the mid-nineteenth century the island has been quarried for its rare type of micro-granite with riebeckite (known as &quot;Ailsite&quot;), which is used to make stones for the sport of curling. , 60–70% of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island and it is one of only two sources for all stones in the sport, the other being the Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales.

Ailsa Craig produced two types of granite for curling, &quot;Blue Hone&quot; and &quot;Ailsa Craig Common Green&quot;. &quot;Blue Hone&quot;, which is unique to Ailsa Craig, has very low water absorption, which prevents the action of repeatedly freezing water from eroding the stone. &quot;Ailsa Craig Common Green&quot; is a lesser quality granite than &quot;Blue Hone&quot;. In the past, most curling stones were made from &quot;Blue Hone&quot; but the quarry is restricted by environmental conditions that exclude blasting.

Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite, granted by the Marquess of Ailsa. A &quot;harvest&quot; of Ailsa Craig granite by Kays took place in 2013, after a hiatus of 11 years; 2,000 tonnes were harvested, sufficient to fill anticipated orders until at least 2020. A subsequent harvest was held in the winter of 2020.

==Natural history==
Sea eagles or erne nested at the Bare Stack until 1881 when the tenant shot the last specimen, which is preserved at Culzean Castle.

Pennant and others have noted that the only trees growing on the island are elders (&quot;Sambucus nigra&quot;) or in the Scots dialect, found as a grove known as The Bourtrees at the Trammins on the southern end of the island. This visitor also rather quaintly mentions that he was surprised to find three species of &quot;reptiles&quot; by which he meant molluscs, namely a naked black slug, the garden snail &quot;Cornu aspersum&quot; and one of the common striped snails of the genus &quot;Cepaea&quot;. He speculated that they had accidentally been brought over from the mainland secreted within vegetables.

Slowworms (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;) are found on the island, although they suffered greatly when badgers and raccoons were introduced by Lord Ailsa. The badgers did not survive long, but the racoons bred for a number of years. 

The mammal fauna included rabbits, and at one time goats, whilst pigs were bred here as food for the inhabitants. The billy goats were shot for sport in the 19th century and no longer survive; only a mounted head of one remains at the McKechnie Institute in Girvan. The rabbits and goats may have been originally introduced to supply food for the fishermen and were mentioned by Pennant in 1772 and by the Rev Abercummie in 1688, who called them by the old name of coneys.

The island is now a bird sanctuary, leased by the RSPB until 2050. Huge numbers of gannets nest here.

Rats were probably introduced via shipwrecks; supposedly, a coal boat that sank offshore was the first culprit and caused great harm to the nesting bird populations, with the puffins proving vulnerable to the extent of extinction as breeding birds. After a long campaign using pioneering techniques, the rats were eradicated in 1991, and now puffins are once again raising young on the island with many other benefits accruing to both the fauna and the flora.

In a small glen above Ailsa Castle, a small freshwater body known as the Garry Loch is located at an altitude of , with a depth of at least .

== In popular culture ==
*In chapter 15 of Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile&quot; (1855), Ailsa Craig is portrayed as an omen. 
*John Keats, during his walk from London to Scotland, composed &quot;To Ailsa Rock&quot; (as the island was known then) following seeing the island.
*British singer-songwriter Nick Mulvey&#x27;s debut album, First Mind features a song entitled Ailsa Craig.

== Gallery ==
==Accidents==
Lawson in the 1890s records that a young lady once fell over the cliff near Craig Na&#x27;an; however, her Victorian style garments caught the wind like a parachute and she escaped with her life and some broken bones that soon knitted back together. A visitor in a group from Stranraer was not so lucky and fell to his death on his way down from the summit.

A shocking death was that of a young boy from Girvan who was sitting amongst loose rocks, pulling out stones and throwing them into the sea when a very large boulder started to move and crushed him. The stone was too heavy to shift and help from the mainland was required to extract the body of the unfortunate victim. In 1887 a ten-year-old boy died whilst collecting eggs at the West Craigs.

<doc id="528908" wikidata="Q2352679" url="?curid=528908" title="M-26 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-26 is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan, running from east of Rockland to its junction with US Highway 41 (US 41) in Copper Harbor. It generally runs southwest-to-northeast in the western half or Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. The northernmost segment, which closely parallels the shore of Lake Superior on the west side of the Keweenaw Peninsula, is highly scenic.

M-26 previously reached the Wisconsin border, but a section of the highway became US 45. Other changes on the northern end of M-26 incorporated highways that were previously numbered M-111 and M-206 in the Eagle Harbor and Eagle River area.

==Route description==
===Southern terminus to Houghton===
M-26 starts at an intersection with US 45 east of Rockland in Michigan&#x27;s Ontonagon County. From there it runs through the town of Mass City to the junction with M-38 east of Greenland. The two highways join for a short distance before M-26 separates turning northeast to Winona across the Houghton County line. In Twin Lakes M-26 passes the shores of the namesake lakes and Twin Lakes State Park. M-26 passes through wooded, hilly terrain in western Houghton County. The segment of roadway in South Range was recently realigned to smooth out curves in the roadway. From there north, M-26 runs generally downhill on approaching the western business district of Houghton and the Portage Lake Lift Bridge from the west. It enters and runs through the middle of Dakota Heights before re-entering Houghton and continuing to approach the bridge.

===Portage Lake Lift Bridge===

The Portage Lake Lift Bridge connects the cities of Hancock and Houghton, Michigan by crossing over the Portage Waterway, an arm of Portage Lake which cuts across the Keweenaw Peninsula with a canal linking the final several miles to Lake Superior to the northwest.

As its name states, the bridge is a lift bridge with the middle section capable of being lifted from its low point of four feet clearance over the water to a clearance of thirty two feet to allow boats to pass underneath. The Portage Lake Lift Bridge is the widest and heaviest double decked vertical lift bridge in the world. The lower deck of the bridge was originally open to rail traffic, but this level is now closed to trains and is used in the winter for snowmobile traffic. Throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the bridge was painted the same color as the Mackinac Bridge — cream and forest green — however, in the early 1990s, it was repainted in a cream and robins egg blue color scheme—exactly the same colors as the National Park Service&#x27;s ship &quot;Ranger III&quot;—to some denoting Houghton as the &quot;Gateway to Isle Royale&quot;.

===Hancock to Copper Harbor===

On the north end of the bridge, M-26 turns east while US 41 turns west into Hancock. M-26 passes through Ripley at the base of the Mt. Ripley Ski Area before turning north to Dollar Bay on the shore of the heavy polluted Torch Lake. Next are the twin communities of Lake Linden and Hubbell. M-26 forms the main streets of these as it passes north from Hubbell into Lake Linden. The highway then runs back to the west to rejoin US 41 in Calumet. US 41/M-26 connects with the northern end of M-203 on the north side of town before heading out to Keweenaw County. In the town of Phoenix, M-26 separates from US 41 one last time, turning west for a stretch along the northern shoreline of the Keweenaw Peninsula. It passes through the communities of Eagle River (county seat of Keweenaw County) and Eagle Harbor.

M-26 in Eagle River crosses the namesake river on the glue-laminated Eagle River Timber Bridge. The bridge features two timber frame arches of and in length. The connecting work between the wood elements is steel. There are hinge points in the center of each arch. The deck is wood covered with an asphalt driving surface. Enough wood was used in construction to fabricate three or four average-sized homes. All the wood was pressure-treated, and the steel was galvanized and epoxy-coated. Reapplication of preservative and tightening bolts will be the routine maintenance required every three years.

Past Eagle Harbor, M-26 meets the highly scenic Brockway Mountain Drive. The northern terminus of M-26 is located in Copper Harbor. The terminus is just past the second intersection with Brockway Mountain Drive near the marina and the location of the Isle Royale Queen ferry to Isle Royale National Park.

==History==
Before it was a state highway, many parts of the original route of M-26 were used as a military road, connecting Fort Wilkins at Copper Harbor with Fort Howard at Green Bay, Wisconsin. From 1919 until 1934, M-26 was routed southward to the Wisconsin state line to a connection with STH-26 along what is now US 45.

The original northern terminus of M-26 was in Laurium at M-15 (now US 41); it was extended by 1927 along US 41 to Mohawk and then replacing M-83 to Gay. This extension would be reversed in 1933 when the Mohawk to Gay routing was turned over to Keweenaw County control. A second extension in 1935 along US 41 to Phoenix replaced M-129 between Phoenix and Eagle Harbor. At this time, M-206 was designated from M-26 to the Eagle Harbor light house. A rerouting of M-26 in November 1940 moved it between Phoenix and Eagle River, replacing M-111. The segment between Phoenix and Eagle River along Copper Falls Mine Road was turned over to Keweenaw County at this time.

In 1979, M-26 was rerouted through Dakota Heights, bisecting it. Park Avenue had formerly served as the main route from Houghton to Atlantic Mine, but this was replaced by the new route of the highway.

The Lake Shore Drive Bridge, which had carried M-26 over the Eagle River, was relegated to pedestrian use in 1990 after the adjacent Eagle River Timber Bridge opened for traffic.

In 2006, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) opened a bypass around the southwest and southern edge of South Range in order to provide a safer route through the town. As of 4 October 2006, MDOT has transferred jurisdiction of the necessary pieces of roadway to complete the M-26 bypass of South Range.

===M-111===

After 1938, the M-111 designation was given to an old M-6 routing in the Keweenaw Peninsula that ran between Eagle River and Phoenix along what is, now, modern-day M-26 parallel to Eagle River. That incarnation lasted two years until M-111 was deleted and M-26 was realigned over it. The M-111 designation has not been used since being deleted in 1940.

===M-206===

M-206 was a state highway that served as a spur route from M-26 into Eagle Harbor and the Eagle Harbor Lighthouse in Keweenaw County in 1935.

<text>Bank of Ireland Group plc () is a commercial bank operation in Ireland and one of the traditional Big Four Irish banks. Historically the premier banking organisation in Ireland, the bank occupies a unique position in Irish banking history. At the core of the modern-day group is the old Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, the ancient institution established by royal charter in 1783.

Bank of Ireland has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

== History ==
Bank of Ireland is the oldest bank in continuous operation (apart from closures due to bank strikes in 1950, 1966, 1970, and 1976) in Ireland.

The Bank of Ireland Act 1781 (21 &amp; 22 Geo. 3. c. 16 (I)) was passed by the Parliament of Ireland, establishing the Bank of Ireland. On 25 June 1783, Bank of Ireland opened for business at St Mary&#x27;s Abbey in a private house previously owned by one Charles Blakeney.

On 6 June 1808, Bank of Ireland moved to the former Parliament House at 2 College Green. By 1827, it had seven branches outside of Dublin, in Belfast, Clonmel, Cork, Derry, Newry, Waterford and Westport.

In 1864, Bank of Ireland paid its first interest on deposits.

By 1883, Bank of Ireland had 58 branches throughout Ireland, and by 1920, the number had grown to 75.

In 1922, Bank of Ireland was appointed as banker to the Government of Ireland.

In 1926, Bank of Ireland took control of the National Land Bank. In 1948, &quot;The Bank of Ireland 1783–1946&quot; by F.G. Hall was published jointly by Hodges Figgis (Dublin) and Blackwell&#x27;s (Oxford).

In 1958, the bank took over the Hibernian Bank Limited.

In 1965, the National Bank Ltd, a bank founded by Daniel O&#x27;Connell in 1835, had branches in Ireland and Britain. The Irish branches were acquired by Bank of Ireland (changing its name to the National Bank of Ireland Ltd), and rebranded temporarily as National Bank of Ireland, before being fully incorporated into Bank of Ireland. The British branches were acquired by Williams &amp; Glyn&#x27;s Bank.

In 1969, Bank of Ireland, Hibernian Bank and the National Bank of Ireland were merged to form the Bank of Ireland Group.

In 1980, Bank of Ireland opened its first ATM (branded as Pass Machines). In 1983, Bank of Ireland celebrated its Bi-Centenary and a commemorative stamp was issued. The Bank also commissioned the publication of &quot;An Irish Florilegium&quot; that year. Only branches in cities and major towns had ATMs in the 1980s but branches in most medium and small towns installed then in the 1990s.

In 1990, Bank of Ireland offered Visa cards for the first time. In 1995, Bank of Ireland merged First New Hampshire Bank with Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s Citizens Financial Group. In 1996, it introduced telephone banking.

In 1996, Bank of Ireland bought the Bristol and West building society for UK£600 million (€882 million), which kept its own brand. In 1997, Bank of Ireland acquired New Ireland Assurance plc.

In 1997, Bank of Ireland introduced Internet banking.

In 1999, the bank held merger talks with Alliance &amp; Leicester, but they were called off. In 2000, it was announced that Bank of Ireland was acquiring Chase de Vere. This share was later sold in 2004.

In 2001, the bank acquired Moneyextra. In 2002, it acquired a 61% share in Iridian, a US investment manager, which doubled the size of its asset management business. It increased its share to 76% in 2004. In 2005, Bank of Ireland completed the sale of the Bristol and West branch and Direct Savings (Contact Centre) to Britannia Building Society.

In 2008, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service changed its rating of Bank of Ireland from stable to negative. Moody&#x27;s pinpointed concerns over weakening asset quality and the impact of a more challenging economic environment on profitability at Bank of Ireland. A share price collapse followed. In 2009, The Irish government announced a €7 billion rescue package for the bank and Allied Irish Banks plc in February. The biggest bank robbery in the history of the state took place at Bank of Ireland at College Green. Consultants Oliver Wyman validated Bank of Ireland&#x27;s bad debt levels at €6 billion over three years to March 2011, a bad debt level which was exceeded by almost €1 billion within a matter of months.

In 2010, the European Commission ordered the disposal of Bank of Ireland Asset Management, New Ireland Assurance, ICS Building Society, its US Foreign Exchange business and the stakes held in the Irish Credit Bureau and in an American Asset Manager followed the receipt of Irish Government State aid. In 2011, the Securities Services Division of the bank was sold to Northern Trust Corporation.

In 2013, Bank of Ireland more than doubled interest rates on mortgages tracking Bank of England rates, (which had remained stable for four years), citing the need to hold more reserves and the &#x27;increased cost of funding mortgages&#x27;. Described by Ray Boulger of broker John Charcol as &#x27;having shot the reputation of its mortgages to smithereens&#x27;, nevertheless, the bank continues to offer highly competitive mortgages through the Post Office.

In 2014, regulation of the bank was transferred to the European Central Bank. Also in 2014, the bank entered into a marketing alliance with EVO Payments International and re-entered the card acquiring market. BOI Payment Acceptance was launched in December 2014.

In September 2022, the Irish state sold its remaining shareholding in the bank to return it to fully private ownership for the first time in a decade.

=== Role as government banker ===
Bank of Ireland is not, and was never, the Irish central bank. However, as well as being a commercial bank – a deposit-taker and a credit institution – it performed many central bank functions, much like the earlier-established Bank of Scotland and Bank of England. Bank of Ireland operated the Exchequer Account and during the nineteenth century acted as something of a banker of last resort. Even the titles of the chairman of the board of directors (the Governor) and the title of the board itself (the Court of Directors) suggest a central bank status. From the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 until 31 December 1971, Bank of Ireland was the banker of the Irish Government.

=== Headquarters ===

The headquarters of the bank until the 1970s was the impressive Parliament House on College Green, Dublin. This building was originally designed by Sir Edward Lovett Pearce in 1729 to host the Irish Parliament, and it was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built bicameral parliament building.

The bank had planned to commission a building designed by Sir John Soane to be constructed on the site bounded by Westmoreland Street, Fleet Street, College Street and D&#x27;Olier Street (now occupied by the Westin Hotel). However, the project was cancelled following the Act of Union in 1800, when the newly defunct Parliament House was bought by the Bank of Ireland in 1803. The former Parliament House continues today as a working branch. Today, visitors can still view the impressive Irish House of Lords chamber within the old headquarters building. The Oireachtas, the modern parliament of Ireland, is now housed in Leinster House in Dublin. In 2011, the Irish Government set out proposals to acquire the building as a venue for the state to use as a cultural venue.
In the 1970s the bank moved its headquarters to a modern building, now known as Miesian Plaza, on Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2. As Frank McDonald notes in his book &quot;Destruction of Dublin&quot;, when these headquarters were built, it caused the world price of copper to rise – such was the usage in the building.
In 2010 the bank moved to its current, smaller headquarters on Mespil Road.

== Banking services ==

Bank of Ireland is headquartered in Dublin, and has operations in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain and elsewhere.

=== Republic of Ireland ===

The group provides a broad range of financial services in Ireland to the personal, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors. These include checking and deposit services, overdrafts, term loans, mortgages, international asset financing, leasing, instalment credit, debt financing, foreign exchange facilities, interest and exchange rate hedging instruments, executor and trustee services.

At its height in 1969, Bank of Ireland had 500 branches in the Republic of Ireland. By 2022, the number of branches had gradually been cut to 169.

=== Northern Ireland ===
In Northern Ireland, Bank of Ireland prints its own banknotes in Pounds Sterling (see section on banknotes below).

In 2021, the number of branches in Northern Ireland was cut from 28 to 13.

=== Great Britain ===

In Great Britain, the bank expanded largely through the takeover of the Bristol and West Building Society in 1996. Bank of Ireland also provides financial services for the British Post Office throughout the UK and AA Savings.

=== Rest of world ===

Operations in the rest of the world are primarily undertaken by Bank of Ireland Corporate Banking which provides services in France, Germany, Spain and the United States.

== Banknotes ==

Although the Bank of Ireland is not a central bank, it does have sterling note-issuing rights in the United Kingdom. While the Bank has its headquarters in Dublin, it also has operations in Northern Ireland, where it retains the legal right (dating from before the partition of Ireland) to print its own banknotes. These are pound sterling notes and equal in value to Bank of England notes, and should not be confused with banknotes of the former Irish pound.

The obverse side of Bank of Ireland banknotes features the Bank of Ireland logo, below which is a line of heraldic shields each representing one of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Below this is a depiction of a seated Hibernia figure, surrounded by the Latin motto of the Bank, &quot;Bona Fides Reipublicae Stabilitas&quot; (&quot;Good Faith is the Cornerstone of the State&quot;). The current series of £5, £10 and £20 notes, issued in April 2008, all feature an illustration of the Old Bushmills Distillery on the reverse side. Prior to 2008, all Bank of Ireland notes featured an image of the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast on the reverse side.

The principal difference between the denominations is their colour and size:
* £5 note, blue
* £10 note, pink
* £20 note, green
* £50 note, blue-green
* £100 note, red.

The Bank of Ireland has never issued its own banknotes in the Republic of Ireland. Section 60 of the Currency Act 1927 removed the right of Irish banks to issue banknotes, however &quot;consolidated banknotes&quot;, of a common design issued by all &quot;Shareholder Banks&quot; under the Act, were issued between 1929 and 1953. These notes were not legal tender.

== Controversies ==

=== Michael Soden ===
Michael Soden abruptly quit as group chief executive on 29 May 2004 when it was discovered that adult material that contravened company policy was found on his Bank PC. Soden issued a personal statement explaining that the high standards of integrity and behaviour in an environment of accountability, transparency and openness, which he espoused, would cause embarrassment to the Bank.

=== DIRT controversy ===
A IR£30.5 million tax arrears liability was settled by Bank of Ireland in July 2000. The Bank told the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee Inquiry that its liability was in the region of £1.5 million. The settlement figure was &#x27;dictated&#x27; by the Revenue Commissioners following an audit by the Commissioners. It was in Bank of Ireland that some of the most celebrated of the &quot;celebrated cases&quot; of non-compliance and bogus non-resident accounts have to date been discovered and disclosed. Thurles, Boyle, Roscrea (1990), Milltown Malbay (1991), Dundalk (1989–90), Killester (1992), Tullamore (1993), Mullingar (1996), Castlecomer, Clonmel, Ballybricken, Ballinasloe, Skibbereen (1988), Dungarvan and, disclosed to the Oireachtas Public Accounts Sub-Committee, Ballaghaderreen (1998) and Ballygar (1999). The Public Accounts Sub-Committee Inquiry concluded that &quot;the most senior executives in the Bank of Ireland did seek to set an ethical tone for the bank and unsuccessfully sought Revenue Commissioners assistance to promote an industry-wide Code of Practice&quot;.

=== Stolen laptops ===
In April 2008 it was announced that four laptops with data pertaining to 10,000 customers were stolen between June and October 2007. This customer information included names, addresses, bank details, medical and pension details.

The thefts were initially reported to the Garda Síochána, however the Banks senior management did not know about the problem until February 2008 after an internal audit uncovered the theft and the Bank did not advise the Data Protection Commissioner and the Central Bank of Ireland until mid-April 2008. It also came to light that none of the laptops used encryption to protect the sensitive data. The Bank has since released a press release detailing the seven branches affected and its initial response, later in the month the Bank confirmed that 31,500 customer records were affected as well as an increased number of branches.

=== Record bank robbery ===
On 27 February 2009, it was reported that a criminal gang from Dublin had stolen €7 million from the Bank of Ireland&#x27;s main branch in College Green. The robbery was the biggest in the history of Ireland, during which the girlfriend of an employee, her mother and her mother&#x27;s five-year-old granddaughter were held hostage at gunpoint. Gardaí arrested six men the next day, and recovered €1.8 million. A spokesperson for the bank said: &quot;Bank of Ireland&#x27;s priority is for the safety and well-being of the staff member and the family involved in this incident and all of the bank&#x27;s support services have been made available to them.&quot;

===Wrong information on recapitalisation and bonuses===

The information provided to the Department of Finance in 2009 in advance of a recapitalisation of the bank which cost the taxpayer €3.5 billion &quot;was incomplete and misleading&quot;. It also gave wrong information to the Minister for Finance who in turn misled the Dáil on €66 million in bonuses it paid since receiving a State guarantee. External examiners found it used &quot;a restrictive and uncommon interpretation of what constituted a performance bonus&quot;. Their report also found that there had been &quot;a catalogue of errors&quot; and that the information supplied by Bank of Ireland to the Department of Finance was &quot;presented in a manner which minimised the level of additional payments made&quot;. The Bank paid €2 million by way of compensation to the Exchequer for providing &quot;misleading&quot; information.

===Relationship with outsourcing companies===

The Bank has forged strong links with IT outsourcing companies since 2004 or earlier. On 1 November 2010, IBM won the $450M full scope outsource contract to manage BoI Group&#x27;s Information Technology (IT) infrastructure services (e.g. mainframe, servers, desktops and print services) in a competitive bid against HP (the incumbent outsource provider) and HCL. This follows on from the Bank&#x27;s natural expiration of its current agreement with HP, which was signed in 2004.

Following a competitive bid process with a number of parties, IBM was selected for exclusive contract negotiations in July 2011. During the intervening period, an extensive due diligence phase has been undertaken and relevant regulatory approval has been granted. IBM will manage the group&#x27;s entire IT infrastructure, including desktop systems, servers, mainframes, local area networks and service desk. Since then, BOI has given HCL a €30m Business Process Outsourcing contract and has selected them as strategic local resourcing partner in Ireland. In addition to that, HCL have opened a software factory for Bank of Ireland in India and has started to outsource production support for the retail banking and payments applications in BOI. This exclusive relationship with HCL has been seen as controversial in the context of the substantial Irish taxpayer investment in Bank of Ireland – and the lack of any significant investment by HCL in Ireland. A banking analyst said in July 2011 that BOI&#x27;s IT system is &quot;very antiquated.&quot;

===Closing accounts associated with Palestine===

Bank of Ireland closed the accounts of the Irish Palestine Solidarity campaign citing that the bank considered Palestine a high-risk country. Sinn Féin TD Mary-Lou McDonald called this outrageous and an insult to the Palestinian people.

==2008 share price collapse==
On 5 March 2009, the shares reached €0.12 during the day, thereby reducing the value of the company by over 99% from its 2007 high. At the 2009 AGM, shareholders criticised the performance of their Auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers.

The Central Bank told the Oireachtas Enterprise Committee that shareholders who lost their money in the banking collapse were to blame for their fate and got what was coming to them for not keeping bank chiefs in check, but did admit that the Central Bank had failed to give sufficient warning about reckless lending to property developers.

<doc id="528916" wikidata="Q2023853" url="?curid=528916" title="Walden Pond">
<text>Walden Pond is a historic pond in Concord, Massachusetts, in the United States. A good example of a kettle hole, it was formed by retreating glaciers 10,000–12,000 years ago. The pond is protected as part of Walden Pond State Reservation, a state park and recreation site managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The reservation was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 for its association with the writer Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), whose two years living in a cabin on its shore provided the foundation for his famous 1854 work, &quot;Walden; or, Life in the Woods&quot;. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 ensured federal support for the preservation of the pond.

==Description==
The Walden Pond Reservation is located south of Massachusetts Route 2 and (mostly) west of Massachusetts Route 126 in Concord and Lincoln, Massachusetts. The Fitchburg Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail passes west of the pond; however, the nearest station is in Concord center, 1.4 miles northwest of the reservation.

The reservation is in size, and its principal feature is Walden Pond, a body of water. A short way north of the pond the site of Thoreau&#x27;s cabin is marked by a series of granite posts. Portions of the pond&#x27;s shore are beach, while other parts descend steeply to the water from trails that ring the pond. There are three buildings at the main beach area at the southeastern shore of the pond. The reservation&#x27;s parking area is located across Route 126, and a ramped footpath descends from that roadway to the pond.

=== History ===
The writer, transcendentalist, and philosopher Henry David Thoreau lived on the northern shore of the pond for two years from the summer of 1845. Thoreau was inspired by former enslaved woman Zilpah White, who lived in a one-room house on the common land that bordered Walden Road and made a living spinning flax into linen fibers. White&#x27;s ability to provide for herself at a time when few if any other Concord women lived alone was a singular accomplishment.

Thoreau&#x27;s account of his experience at the pond was recorded in &quot;Walden; or, Life in the Woods&quot;, and made the pond famous. The land at that end was owned by Thoreau&#x27;s friend and mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who let Thoreau use it for his experiment. Walden Pond was in a neglected, heavily used and even socially dangerous area just outside the town, where African American slaves had frequently lived and atrocities against them had been committed; the earth there had been mined, the town dump was eventually located across from it, and it was full of marks from mining hauls, and pottery and charcoal making. Thus, according to Austin Meredith, Thoreau&#x27;s writing can be credited not only with encouraging a general respect for Nature, but with inspiring special care for and reclamation of land that has in history been abused or exploited. The Concord Museum contains the bed, chair, and desk from Thoreau&#x27;s cabin.

During the winter he lived at Walden Pond a large group of men decamped from the train to cut ice there for sixteen days. In his journal, Thoreau philosophized upon the wintry sight of the ice harvesters: &quot;The sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, of Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges&quot;. It was well known at the time that ice shipped from Boston went to many ports, including India.

An amusement park with swings, concession stands and an event hall, located at the western end of the pond, burned down in 1902 and was never rebuilt.

Descendants of Emerson and other families deeded the land around the pond to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1922. In 1961, the Middlesex County Commissioners, then managing the land, proposed leveling a significant portion of the preserve for a parking lot and other &quot;improvements.&quot; An acre of woodland had been leveled for access to the public beach when the Commissioners were sued to stop the destruction of the existing environment. Judge David A Rose, sitting in the Massachusetts Superior Court, ruled that Walden&#x27;s deed donating the property to the Commonwealth required preservation of the land and barred further development. The decision received national recognition, and Judge Rose received hundreds of letters from school children across the country thanking him for saving the land. Walden Pond became part of the state parks system in 1975. It is also among the national landmarks preserved by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.

In 1977, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts installed a porous pavement parking area at Walden Pond as a special technology transfer demonstration project, following methodology generated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1972. The porous pavement still functions decades later, despite experiencing more freeze-thaw cycling than most other parts of the world.

Recording artist Don Henley initiated The Walden Woods Project in 1990 to prevent the area around Walden Pond from being developed. Through a joint effort of The Trust for Public Land, the Walden Woods Project, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, more than 85 acres of land were permanently protected, including Bear Garden Hill, where Thoreau took moonlit walks. In 1995, The Trust for Public Land also assisted in the acquisition of a historic home, which would become the research center and library for the Thoreau Institute.

== Legend ==

===Formation, from &quot;The Ponds&quot; (&quot;Walden&quot;, 1854)===
While living in Walden Woods for two years beginning in 1845, Henry David Thoreau contemplated Walden Pond&#x27;s features. In &quot;The Ponds&quot; section of &quot;Walden&quot;, published in 1854, Thoreau extols the water&#x27;s physical properties. He details its unparalleled water quality; its clarity, color, and temperature; its unique animal life (aquatic, bird, and mammal); its rock formations and bed; and especially, its mirror-like surface properties.

Thoreau contemplates the source of the pristine water body in the woods. He observes that it had no visible inlet or outlet, and considers the possibility of an unidentified spring at the bottom. Noting the kettle landform&#x27;s ramparts and resilient shore, he concludes that a unique, natural geologic event formed the site, while recognizing local myths:

Some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved. My townsmen have all heard the tradition -- the oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youth -- that anciently the Indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped, and from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond here, and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he first came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for the stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me. I detect the paver. If the name was not derived from that of some English locality -- Saffron Walden, for instance -- one might suppose that it was called originally &quot;Walled-in&quot; Pond.

===Romanticism, from &quot;The Ponds&quot; (&quot;Walden&quot;, 1854)===
Also in &quot;The Ponds,&quot; Thoreau describes incorporeal experiences around the water, both experiences related to him by others and his own. Thoreau, who was well read and a transcendentalist, and therefore presumably intimately familiar with Romanticism, relates the stories in a way that could be argued to interpret or reveal the pond as the locale of the Grail Legend in the Americas. In the following passage, Walden Pond&#x27;s vanishing treasure chest echoes the protagonist&#x27;s fleeting encounter with the grail in Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s German romance &quot;Parzival&quot;, and the pond&#x27;s canoe is reminiscent of the boat in &quot;A Fairy Tale&quot;. (Goethe, who was a Classicist, not a Romanticist, positively viewed &quot;Parzival&quot;.) Thoreau wrote:

==Activities and amenities==

In addition to being a popular swimming destination in the summer, Walden Pond State Reservation provides opportunities for boating, hiking, picnicking, and fishing. There is a replica of Thoreau&#x27;s cabin available for viewing. The reservation is open year-round for day use, but does not allow camping overnight.

A new Walden Pond Visitor Center, designed by Maryann Thompson, opened in 2016. The building uses no fossil fuel and has many other sustainable design features.

==Influences==
Walden Pond inspired the naming of the American film company Walden Media and is a frequent subject of professional and amateur photographers.

C-SPAN broadcast an episode of its &quot;American Writers&quot; series from the shores of Walden Pond in 2001.

Walden Pond appears in the video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; where Thoreau&#x27;s cabin is preserved. The pond also serves as the backdrop for the game &#x27;Walden, a game&#x27; where players assume the role of author Henry David Thoreau during his time living at the pond in the 1840s. The game was in development for more than ten years and is currently available on Mac, PC, and PS4.

<doc id="528918" wikidata="Q7986883" url="?curid=528918" title="Charleston Dirty Birds">
<text>The Charleston Dirty Birds are an American professional baseball team based in Charleston, West Virginia. They are a member of the South Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, a partner league of Major League Baseball. The Dirty Birds have played their home games at GoMart Ballpark since 2005.

==Team history==

===Before current era (1910–1983)===
The history of professional baseball in Charleston, dates back to , and a team known as the Charleston Statesmen of the long-forgotten Class D Virginia Valley League. In , the Statesmen moved to the Class D Mountain State League, and then folded after that year. A new team, the Charleston Senators was formed in 1914 and lasted three seasons in the Class D Ohio State League. In , a new Senators team joined the Class C Mid-Atlantic League as an affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. This team lasted until . In , the Senators were reformed as a member of the Class A Central League. In , the city was granted a franchise in the Triple-A American Association. At first, this team was affiliated with the Chicago White Sox, then the Detroit Tigers, and finally the Washington Senators. In , the Charleston Senators won the American Association championship. The franchise ceased operations after the season.

In , the city had no team, but the Triple-A International League San Juan Marlins, affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals, moved to the city but on May 19 the team was deemed not financially viable. In , the Charleston Indians, affiliated with the Cleveland Indians, moved to the city in the Class-A Eastern League, and in that league was elevated to Double-A. The team folded after the season.

Baseball returned to the city in with the Charleston Charlies of the Triple-A International League. The Charlies played in the International League from 1971 to 1983. The team had previously been the Columbus Jets. The Charlies were affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Houston Astros, Texas Rangers, and finally the Cleveland Indians. The team won the International League championship in and . The Charlies left for Maine following the season, and, after relocating to Moosic, Pennsylvania in 1989, the team is now known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.

Today, the Dirty Birds sell nostalgic &quot;throwback&quot; merchandise from the Pittsburgh-affiliated era of the Charlies, which is generally considered the pinnacle of baseball in the city.

===Revival era (1987–2020)===
In , the city resumed minor league baseball after a three-year absence. The new team was first called the Charleston Wheelers, so named for the city&#x27;s history of stern- and side-wheeled boats. The Wheelers began as a co-op team, with players from several Major League Baseball franchises including the Los Angeles Dodgers, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, and Atlanta Braves.

In 1988, the franchise became the Chicago Cubs&#x27; third full-season Class A franchise (the other two being Peoria in the Midwest League and Winston-Salem in the Carolina League). The only two players on that 1988 squad to reach the Major Leagues were SS Alex Arias and C Matt Walbeck.

The Wheelers won the Class A South Atlantic League championship in , the only league title for the franchise. By that point, they had changed affiliation to the Cincinnati Reds. SAL Northern Division championships followed in 1991 and 1992, with the Wheelers losing the championship series both years.

In late , the Wheelers were purchased from then-owner Dennis Bastien by a conglomerate of local owners led by Charleston businessman Michael Paterno. The team changed its name to the Charleston Alley Cats in 1995 and switched colors from blue and green to red and black. The team was purchased in by Tom Dickson and Sherrie Myers. In , the team changed affiliation to the Kansas City Royals, again in to the Toronto Blue Jays, to the Milwaukee Brewers after the season, joined the Pirates in 2009, and finally the Seattle Mariners in 2018. Prior to the season, they adopted the West Virginia Power name. To quote the team&#x27;s announcement following their decision to change the team name:

West Virginia is and will continue to be recognized as one of the leading energy providers for the country. The energy production from coal, natural gas, and hydro-electric sources, combined with the fact that Charleston serves as the center for the state&#x27;s political and economic powers led us to the name of the team. We felt it was extremely important that the name reflect the entire region and are excited about the tremendous marketing opportunities that will go along with the name.

The Power won the 2007 SAL Northern Division title, but lost in the league championship series to the Columbus Catfish in three straight games.

===2021 and beyond===
In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, the Mariners opted to discontinue their affiliation with West Virginia, leaving them in need of a new affiliate for 2021. It was later confirmed that the Power would be dropped from affiliated baseball, with the team stating its intent to continue playing for 2021 and beyond in another league.

On February 24, 2021, the team announced that it had been sold to a new ownership group led by Andy Shea, also owner of the Power&#x27;s former South Atlantic League rivals the Lexington Legends. The Power joined the Legends in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent MLB Partner league, for the 2021 season and beyond.

On September 28, 2021, the team officially changed their name to the Charleston Dirty Birds, a reference to the canary in a coal mine. Charleston won the second-half Southern Division championship, but fell short in the playoffs, losing to the eventual league champion Lexington Legends in the decisive third game of their playoff series.

==Season-by-season records==
===Independent season-by-season records===
==Ballparks==
The Alley Cats and their predecessors played in Watt Powell Park in the Kanawha City neighborhood of Charleston. Seating approximately 4,500 fans, Watt Powell Park was bordered by MacCorkle Avenue on the front (north) side, 35th Street on the east, and South Park Road on the west. On the south side of the park, a ridge of hills formed a natural boundary. Fans who would otherwise have had to pay to see the games periodically watched the action from a CSX railroad line hard up against the south wall of the stadium.

The Dirty Birds now play their home games in GoMart Ballpark at the east edge of downtown Charleston, a little more than a mile across the Kanawha River from the former site of Watt Powell Park. Most of the financing for the $25 million stadium came from the state, and the city, although the ownership team put up approximately $5 million. The original cost of the ballpark was supposed to be $20 million but cost overruns put the figure at $25 million. The city&#x27;s share came mostly from the sale of Watt Powell Park to the nearby University of Charleston, which immediately sold two-thirds of the land to Charleston Area Medical Center, the region&#x27;s largest hospital. Originally, the new park was to be completed for the 2004 season, but politically induced delays in securing state funds forced construction to be put off for a year. The new park opened in April 2005.

<text>Syzran () is the third largest city in Samara Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of Saratov Reservoir of the Volga River. Population: 

==History==
Founded in 1683 as a fortress, Syzran grew into an important trading center and was granted town status in 1796. One tower from the 17th-century fortress still stands. It is also the site of Syzran Bridge, once the longest bridge in Europe.

On the night of 18–19 February 2025, Ukraine launched a drone attack against a Rosneft oil refinery in Syzran, with local Telegram channels claiming that the attack led to a fire in the area. Local governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev claimed that there were no casualties, and that emergency services were working on site.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Syzran serves as the administrative center of Syzransky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with three rural localities, incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Syzran—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Syzran is incorporated as Syzran Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s main employers are a large oil refinery owned by Rosneft, OAO Tyazhmash heavy industry machinery metallurgy mechanical turbines related to electricity production (and working with Czech Blansko firm CKD Blansko on some works, like in South America), and the Syzran power station.

==Notable people==
*Konstantin Fedin, novelist and literary functionary
*Alexey Tolstoy, writer
*Arkady Ostrovsky, composer
*Andrei Sinyavsky, writer
*Mikhail Korniyenko, cosmonaut
*Viktor Nikitin, singer
*Ekaterina Vetkova, handball player

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Syzran is twinned with:
* Pingdingshan, Henan, China (November 28, 2000)

<doc id="528922" wikidata="Q845465" url="?curid=528922" title="Toots and the Maytals">
<text>The Maytals, known from 1972 to 2020 as Toots and the Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group, one of the best known ska and rocksteady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music.

Frontman Toots Hibbert, who died in 2020, was considered a reggae pioneer on par with Bob Marley. His soulful vocal style was compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 100 Greatest Singers. After Hibbert&#x27;s death, the Maytals indicated that they would continue as a working group.

Their 1968 single &quot;Do the Reggay&quot; was the first song to use the word &quot;reggae&quot;, coining the name of the genre and introducing it to a global audience. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; credits Toots and the Maytals in the etymology of the word &quot;Reggae&quot;. According to Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, &quot;The Maytals were unlike anything else ... sensational, raw, and dynamic.&quot;

==Career==
===Formation and early success===
Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, the frontman of the group, was born in May Pen, Clarendon, Jamaica, in 1942, the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir and moved to Kingston in the late 1950s.

===The Maytals===
Hibbert met Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; Mathias in Kingston in 1962 and formed The Maytals as a vocal trio, a group whose early recordings were incorrectly attributed to The Flames and The Vikings in the UK by Island Records. The first instrumentalist members added to the group included Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Rad Bryan, and Paul Douglas. In 1972, the group changed its name from The Maytals to Toots and the Maytals, with &quot;Toots&quot; referring to frontman Toots Hibbert, and &quot;the Maytals&quot; referring to the group&#x27;s instrumentalists and background vocalists. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica. Accompanied by Paul Douglas and Radcliffe &quot;Dougie&quot; Bryan in studio, Jackson explained, We&#x27;re all original members of Toots and the Maytals band. First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: Toots, Raleigh, and Jerry…And then they were signed to Island Records, Chris Blackwell. And we were their recording band...Blackwell] decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band. So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. And then we hit the road in 1975.

===The 1960s===
The Maytals first had chart success when recording for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd at Studio One. With musical backing from Dodd&#x27;s house band, the Skatalites, the Maytals&#x27; close-harmony gospel singing ensured success, overshadowing Dodd&#x27;s other up-and-coming vocal group, the Wailers. After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster before recording with Byron Lee in 1966. With Lee, the Maytals won the first-ever Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition in 1966 with their original song &quot;Bam Bam&quot;. &quot;Bam Bam&quot; was later covered in a Dancehall style by Sister Nancy and also by Yellowman in 1982, but Toots and the Maytals were not credited or issued royalties for use of the song by either artist. They went on to win that contest two additional times. The group&#x27;s musical career was interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was jailed for 18 months for possession of marijuana. He stated that he was not arrested for marijuana, but while bailing out a friend. Hibbert reportedly wrote &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot; about his time in jail.

Following Hibbert&#x27;s release in 1967, the Maytals began working with the Chinese Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which yielded a string of hits throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. These included &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, released in 1968, which was the first song to use the word &quot;reggae&quot; and gave the developing genre its name.

The Maytals are responsible for some of the biggest hits in reggae history, including &quot;Pressure Drop,&quot; &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; and &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot;.

===The 1970s===
In 1970 &quot;Monkey Man&quot; became the group&#x27;s first international hit. By 1971, they signed a recording contract with Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records who reformed the band with Toots Hibbert as the front man backed by a hand-selected group of instrumentalists dubbed The Maytals Band. They become the biggest act in Jamaica, and had become international stars. Blackwell initially concentrated on the UK market, where previous Jamaican acts had had success. The band&#x27;s albums with Island Records were released through its Dragon Records imprint. Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records, &quot;established reggae as an international genre with Toots and the Maytals, Lee Scratch Perry, and Sly and Robbie.&quot;

In 1972 the group won the Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition for a third time with &quot;Pomp and Pride&quot;. That year, the group contributed two songs to the soundtrack for &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, the 1972 film starring Jimmy Cliff, named as one of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s top 10 soundtracks of all time. The film introduced Jamaican music to American audiences, and the band appears in one of the scenes.

After Kong&#x27;s death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong&#x27;s former sound engineer, Warrick Lyn. Their re-instated producer Byron Lee renamed them Toots &amp; the Maytals. The group released three best-selling albums produced by Lyn and Blackwell of Island Records, and enjoyed international hits with &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; in 1975. Music critic Lester Bangs described the album &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; as &quot;perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released&quot;. Chris Blackwell had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve known Toots longer than anybody – much longer than Bob (Bob Marley). Toots is one of the purest human beings I&#x27;ve met in my life, pure almost to a fault.&quot; To promote these albums, the band toured with the Who, Jackson Browne, the Eagles, and Linda Ronstadt.

In 1975, Toots and the Maytals headlined alongside Santana (band) at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. 

On 1 October 1975, Toots and the Maytals were broadcast live on KMET-FM as they performed at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. This broadcast was re-mastered and released as the &quot;Sailin&#x27; On&quot; album via Klondike Records.

Following the release of &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot;, Toots &amp; the Maytals were invited to tour as the opening act for the Who during their 1975–76 North American tour.

Toots and the Maytals&#x27; compositions experienced a resurgence of popularity in 1978–80 during the reggae punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials covered &quot;Monkey Man&quot; on their 1979 debut album and the Clash covered the group&#x27;s hit &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;. During this period Toots and the Maytals were also included in the lyrics to Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers&#x27; song, &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot;: &quot;The Wailers will be there, the Damned, the Jam, the Clash, the Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too&quot;.

===The 1980s===

====&quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;====
On 29 September 1980, the band recorded, pressed and distributed a new album, &quot;Toots Live&quot;, to the record shops all in the space of 24 hours in an attempt to make the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. A live concert was recorded on reels of two-inch, 24-track analog tape, then rushed by van to sound engineers. After a running order was determined, the record label was quickly designed and sent to the printers. The album masters, labels and the outer covers were then separately sped to the Gedmel factory near Leicester, and the finished product was assembled and delivered to Coventry, where the band was playing the next day, successfully meeting the 24-hour deadline. Due to record label oversight, the achievement was not successfully registered with the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Island Records&#x27; Rob Bell was quoted as saying, &quot;Unfortunately, the record was &quot;not&quot; included in the Guinness book, because they required prior notification that the event was going to take place, and no one at Island had informed them of the project!&quot; The record for &quot;fastest album release&quot; was not officially held in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; until 28 years later when Vollgas Kompanie claimed the honour in 2008 for recording and releasing their album &quot;Live&quot; in 24 hours – matching the time interval in which Toots and the Maytals recorded, pressed and distributed &quot;Toots Live&quot; in 1980.

The group split up after releasing the 1981 album &quot;Knockout&quot;. In 1982, Toots &amp; the Maytals&#x27; &quot;Beautiful Woman&quot; reached number one in New Zealand.

Hibbert continued to record as a solo artist throughout the 1980s.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s a new lineup of the Maytals was formed. In February 1990 Toots and the Maytals performed on VH1&#x27;s &quot;New Visions World Beat&quot;, guest-hosted by Nile Rodgers. The group continued touring and recording successfully, with two appearances at Reggae Sunsplash in the mid-1990s.

===2000s===

In a 2003 review on NPR&#x27;s Fresh Air broadcast, critic Milo Miles described the song Pressure Drop as, &quot;utterly irresistible but utterly mysterious like Louie Louie or Tutti Frutti. It gets over on pure passion, and it seems all you need to know is when it drops you&#x27;re gonna feel it.&quot;

In 2004, the group released &quot;True Love&quot;, an album of re-recorded versions of their earlier hits in collaboration with fellow musicians including Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Trey Anastasio, No Doubt, Ben Harper, the Roots, and Shaggy. The album received critical acclaim from outlets including NPR and Rolling Stone. The &quot;True Love&quot; album won the Grammy Award that year for best reggae album.

Donald Trump was quoted as appreciating the reggae music of Toots and the Maytals in 2004 when he said, &quot;I heard the guest band, Toots &amp; The Maytals, practising out on the set of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&quot; (Trump was the guest host on an episode in April 2004). &quot;They sounded terrific, and I went out to listen to them for a while. My daughter Ivanka had told me how great they were, and she was right. The music relaxed me, and surprisingly, I was not nervous.&quot;

In 2006, they recorded a reggae/ska version of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Let Down&quot; for the tribute album, &quot;Radiodread&quot;. The album was a song for song makeover of the British rock band&#x27;s album &quot;OK Computer&quot; into reggae, dub and ska. In August 2007 Toots &amp; the Maytals released &quot;Light Your Light&quot;, which featured re-workings of older songs such as &quot;Johnny Cool Man&quot;, as well as new material. The album was nominated in 2008 for a Grammy in the best reggae album category.

Toots &amp; the Maytals hold the current record of number one hits in Jamaica, with a total of thirty-one.

In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the record label Island Records Toots &amp; the Maytals and Amy Winehouse, both signed up to the label, were billed to perform together at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London on 31 May 2009. Winehouse had covered the band&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Man&quot;. However, Winehouse&#x27;s performance was cancelled, and Toots &amp; the Maytals instead played at the more intimate Bush Hall to a sell-out crowd.

===2010s===
In 2011, director George Scott and producer Nick De Grunwald released the documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot;, which was featured on BBC. Described as &quot;The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica&quot;, it features appearances by Marcia Griffiths, Jimmy Cliff, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Willie Nelson, Anthony DeCurtis, Ziggy Marley, Chris Blackwell, Paolo Nutini, Sly Dunbar, and Robbie Shakespeare.

The 2012 live album &quot;Unplugged on Strawberry Hill&quot; gained Hibbert his fifth Grammy nomination.

In May 2013, Hibbert was struck in the head with a 1.75-litre vodka bottle while performing onstage at a Richmond, Virginia, festival. His injuries resulted in a concussion and treatment required six staples in his head. The man who threw the bottle was arrested, and despite Hibbert&#x27;s pleas for clemency to the judge, was given a six-month sentence. Hibbert&#x27;s letter to the judge also detailed the extent of his injury: &quot;I continue to suffer from extreme anxiety, memory loss, headaches, dizziness and most sadly of all, a fear of crowds and performing. I am not able to write songs as I did before or remember the lyrics of songs that I wrote and have performed for decades.&quot; After his injury, Hibbert canceled all subsequent performances, and the group did not perform live again until 2016.

In 2015, Vogue listed the song &quot;54-46 Was My Number&quot; by Toots and the Maytals as one of their &quot;15 Roots Reggae Songs You Should Know&quot;; and in an interview with Patricia Chin of VP Records, &quot;Vogue&quot; listed the group as part of an abbreviated list of early &quot;reggae royalty&quot; that recorded at Studio 17 in Kingston, Jamaica which included Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, Burning Spear, Toots and the Maytals, The Heptones, and Bunny Wailer.

In 2016 Toots and the Maytals announced a return to the stage with their first tour in 3 years, and on 15 June at The Observatory North Park in San Diego the group returned to the stage for the first time since 2013.

In 2017 Toots and the Maytals played Coachella Fest 16 and 23 April at 4:20 pm. They became the second reggae-based group to perform at the Coachella festival, after Chronixx in 2016.

Toots and the Maytals have been cited as an inspiration for other music artists when it comes to career longevity. Jamaican artist Sean Paul explains this by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen some great people in my industry, you know, people like Toots … Toots and the Maytals. Toots he&#x27;s a great reggae artist and he&#x27;s still doing it … He&#x27;s up there in years and he&#x27;s doing it. Those kind of artists inspire me. I know I&#x27;m just going to keep on doing music as long as I can.&quot;

On 24 June 2017 at the Glastonbury Festival, Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30 with BBC Four scheduled to show highlights from their set. When they did not appear it was suspected they missed their time slot, and BBC broadcaster Mark Radcliffe apologised on their behalf stating, &quot;If you were expecting Toots and the Maytals – and, frankly, we all were – it seems like they were on Jamaican time or something because they didn&#x27;t make it to the site on time.&quot; The group was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving them the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour. On 29 July 2017 Toots and The Maytals headlined the 35th anniversary of the WOMAD UK festival with a performance that was reported as &quot;easily one of the true highlights of WOMAD 2017&quot;.

In 2018, Toots and the Maytals launched a 50th anniversary tour with concert appearances in North America from April to August, moving to dates in the UK starting in October.

On 25 July 2018 Toots and the Maytals debuted an original song entitled &quot;Marley&quot; live on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, and also played the classic &quot;Funky Kingston&quot;.

On 24 August 2018 Toots and the Maytals performed at Lockn&#x27; Festival in Arrington, Virginia, where guest Taj Mahal accompanied them on the song &quot;Monkey Man&quot;.

In July 2019 Coors Brewing Company used the Toots and the Maytals song &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; in a television advertisement for Coors Light.

===2020s===
On 11 September 2020, Toots and the Maytals frontman Toots Hibbert died at age 77.

Following Hibberts&#x27; death in 2020, there was uncertainty as to if the Maytals would return. In November 2020, Paul Douglas and Jackie Jackson confirmed that the band would carry on, as a tribute to Hibbert.

On 14 March 2021 at the 63rd annual Grammy Awards, Toots and The Maytals won Best Reggae Album for the album &quot;Got to be Tough&quot;.

In July 2021 the family of Toots Hibbert issued a cease and desist letter to the members of The Maytals Band. The letter sought to prohibit the remaining band members from performing under the name &quot;The Maytals&quot; (the name the band has been performing under for over 50 years). Subsequently, a Toots Hibbert tribute concert where multiple artists were scheduled to perform in London on 4 September 2021 was cancelled as a result of the cease and desist letter. In Dec. 2021, 50 years after The Maytals Band was assembled, the band members came to an out-of-court settlement to part ways with the estate of Toots Hibbert after the estate asserted rights of control over the Maytals name and trademark. The band members who were part of the original lineup in 1972 and those who joined in years between 1972-2022 are now referred to as &quot;former members of The Maytals Band&quot;.

<text>Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie, Baron Runcie, (2 October 1921 – 11 July 2000) was an English Anglican bishop. He was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1980 to 1991, having previously been Bishop of St Albans. He travelled the world widely to spread ecumenicism and worked to foster relations with both Protestant and Catholic churches across Europe. He was a leader of the Liberal Anglo-Catholicism movement. He came under attack for expressing compassion towards bereaved Argentines after the Falklands War of 1982, and generated controversy by supporting women&#x27;s ordination.

Biographer Adrian Hastings argues that Runcie was not a distinguished writer or thinker, but was a good administrator who made shrewd appointments, demanded quality, and recognised good performances.

==Early life==
Runcie was born on 2 October 1921 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, and spent his early life in Great Crosby, Lancashire, to middle-class and rather non-religious parents. He initially attended St Luke&#x27;s Church, Crosby (where he was confirmed in 1936), before switching to the Anglo-Catholic St Faith&#x27;s Church about a mile down the road. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; Boys&#x27; School, Crosby, before going to Brasenose College, Oxford.

During the Second World War he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Scots Guards on 21 November 1942, and was given the service number 251985. He served with the regiment&#x27;s 3rd (Tank) Battalion, then part of the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, as a tank commander, landing in Normandy with his unit as part of Operation Overlord in July 1944, a few weeks after the D-Day landings on 6 June, and fought with the battalion throughout the entire North West Europe Campaign until Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) in May 1945. Towards the end of the war, he earned the Military Cross (MC) for two feats of bravery in March 1945: he rescued one of his men from a crippled tank under heavy enemy fire, and the next day took his own tank into an exceptionally exposed position in order to knock out three anti-tank guns. As a result, he is unique among modern archbishops of Canterbury in having fought for his country. In May 1945, he was among the first British soldiers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

After the surrender of Nazi Germany, Runcie served with the occupying forces in Cologne and then with the boundary commission dealing with the future status of the Free Territory of Trieste.

On his return to Oxford, he surprised many by taking first-class honours in Greats. He was a member of both Conservative and socialist societies at Oxford, and through that he had his first dealings with the young Margaret Thatcher (then Margaret Roberts), a relationship which was to prove pivotal during his archiepiscopate.

==Ordained ministry==
Runcie studied for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge, where he received a diploma rather than a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in theology. He was made deacon in Advent 1950 and ordained priest the following Advent, both times by Noel Hudson, Bishop of Newcastle, at Newcastle Cathedral, to serve as a curate in the parish of All Saints in the wealthy Newcastle upon Tyne suburb of Gosforth, then a rapidly growing suburban area. Rather than the conventional minimum three-year curacy, after two years Runcie was invited to return to Westcott House as chaplain and, later, vice-principal. In 1956 he was elected fellow and dean of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he would meet his future wife, Rosalind, the daughter of the college bursar.

In 1960, he returned to the world of the theological college, becoming principal of Cuddesdon College, near Oxford, and vicar of the local parish church (Church of All Saints, Cuddesdon). He spent 10 years there and transformed what had been a rather monastic and traditionally Anglo-Catholic institution into a stronghold of the liberal Catholic tradition of the Church of England. In this period, his name became more and more strongly spoken of as a future bishop, and speculation was confirmed when he was appointed Bishop of St Albans in 1970. He was duly consecrated a bishop on 24 February 1970 by Michael Ramsey, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster Abbey.

Like Gosforth in the 1950s, the Diocese of St Albans was a booming suburban area, popular with families moving out of a depopulating London. As well as diocesan work, he worked with broadcasters as chairman of the Central Religious Advisory Committee, and was appointed chairman of the joint Anglican–Orthodox Commission.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
Runcie was selected as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1979, as Donald Coggan approached his retirement from the see. There is evidence that Runcie was the second choice of the Crown Appointments Commission, the first choice, Hugh Montefiore, having proven politically unacceptable to the then newly elected Conservative government. He was installed as archbishop on 25 March 1980.

During his time as Archbishop of Canterbury he witnessed a breaking down of traditionally convivial relations between the Church of England – which had often been described as &quot;the Tory party at prayer&quot; – and the Conservative (i.e. Tory) Party. The breakdown was due mainly to the church&#x27;s pronouncements on political matters and Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s support for the ethos of individualism and wealth creation as well as her words in 1987 which were misquoted as a claim that &quot;there is no such thing as society&quot; (although her exact words, from a magazine interview, were &quot;who is &#x27;society&#x27;? There is no such thing!&quot;), which some Anglicans thought was uncaring and anti-Christian.

In 1981, Runcie officiated at the marriage of Charles, Prince of Wales, to Lady Diana Spencer.

Runcie attempted to give a service at St Nicholas&#x27;s Parish Church in Liverpool on 11 March 1982, but was heckled by people upset about the Pope&#x27;s prospective visit to Britain. They shouted that Runcie was a traitor, a liar and was a traitor to the Church of England. After interruptions of the service, Runcie asked the congregation to heed chapter five of St Matthew&#x27;s Gospel (the Sermon on the Mount), telling them &quot;For they are the words of Jesus himself&quot;. The crowd replied: &quot;You had better read your Bible yourself. You are a traitor and a Judas.&quot; Outside, demonstrators held placards with the inscriptions &quot;Rome Rules Runcie&quot;, &quot;Our Faith Our Bible&quot;, &quot;Revive Reformation&quot;, &quot;Calvary not Popery&quot; and &quot;Jesus What More&quot;. Afterwards, Runcie said: &quot;I am trying my best to find forgiveness for them, but it is very upsetting.&quot; Cardinal Basil Hume called the demonstration &quot;particularly abhorrent and a scandal&quot;.

On 17 March 1982, Runcie gave a speech to the National Society for the Promotion of Religious Education in which he said that Christianity should play a crucial part in the religious education of all pupils, even if they were non-Christian: &quot;While recognising that a truly pluralistic society should not merely tolerate diversity but value and nurture it, I must also express the fear that at times we seem tempted to sacrifice too much of our native Christian tradition on the altar of multi-culturalism.&quot;

In a gesture of goodwill, he knelt in prayer with Pope John Paul II in Canterbury Cathedral during John Paul&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom in 1982.

On 18 April 1982, Runcie said in an interview with London Weekend Television that he hoped the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church would be unified by 2000: &quot;I dream of unity with Rome, and with the great Reform tradition and with the Orthodox, by the end of the century, but we will have to get a move on, certainly, if that is our target. I don&#x27;t see why we should not have that target.&quot; Runcie said of the office of Pope: &quot;There is advantage in having a central focus of affection, even a central spokesman to articulate what the churches in different parts of the world are thinking. I think Anglicans recognise that there is value in that sort of concept&quot;. He also played down the Queen&#x27;s role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England:
In 1985, there was friction between the Church of England and members of the Conservative government, in particular Norman Tebbit, over a church report, &quot;Faith in the City&quot;, which criticised the government&#x27;s handling of social problems in British inner-city areas. Tebbit became a strong supporter of the disestablishment of the Church of England, claiming that institutions affiliated to the British state should not express what he saw as overtly partisan political views.

Much of the middle period of Runcie&#x27;s archiepiscopate was taken up with the tribulations of two men who had been close to him: the suicide of Gareth Bennett and the kidnapping of Terry Waite.

When Runcie visited Pope John Paul II in 1989, he set out to reconcile the Church of England with the Church of Rome. Runcie advocated the papacy as having a &quot;primacy of honour&quot; rather than &quot;primacy of jurisdiction&quot; over the Anglican churches, a proposal consistent with the report of the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission. The Pope did not go along with this, however, claiming that the papacy already has primacy of jurisdiction over all other churches regardless of whether or not this is officially recognised and also that the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church would not change to accommodate Runcie&#x27;s proposals.

In internal Anglican matters, much of Runcie&#x27;s time as archbishop was taken up with the debate over whether to proceed with the ordination of women in the Church of England as well as the fallout from the ordination of women as priests and bishops in other parts of the Anglican Communion. Runcie&#x27;s position on the matter had been described as &quot;nailing his colours firmly to the fence&quot; – his liberal theology conflicting with his instinctive conservatism.

The church&#x27;s attitude to homosexuality was also a divisive issue during this period, although it did not assume the crisis proportions it would in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In public Runcie stuck to official Church of England policy, as set out in the publication &quot;Issues in Human Sexuality&quot;, that homosexual practice was not ideal for lay people and unacceptable for clergy.

== Retirement and death ==
Runcie retired as Archbishop of Canterbury effective 31 January 1991. On 1 February, he was created a life peer – gazetted on 7 February as Baron Runcie, &quot;of Cuddesdon in the County of Oxfordshire&quot; – enabling him to immediately re-enter the House of Lords where he had previously sat as a Lord Spiritual. He died of cancer in St Albans in 2000, and is buried in the grounds of St Albans Cathedral.

==Family==
Runcie&#x27;s wife, Rosalind, whom he married on 5 September 1957, was well-known as a pianist. They had two children: James Runcie, a novelist, and Rebecca Runcie. Rosalind Runcie died on 12 January 2012.

<text>[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian [[Poetry]] was a web project created in 2003 by David Rea to determine whether &quot;non-negotiated collaboration&quot; could evolve interesting and intelligent poetry using a process akin to natural selection. Visitors to the site were presented with two poems, both arbitrary splicings of two &#x27;parent&#x27; poems. The visitor was asked to select the more appealing, and poems that survived the process of voting went on to be spliced into other &#x27;healthy&#x27; poems. Unpopular poems eventually &quot;died&quot;. The intent was to create, in the long term, poems that were progressively more interesting and sensible.

According to the introduction to the now-defunct site, the poems would, &quot;(i)n all likelihood . . . both be abysmal pieces of nonsensical garbage. That&#x27;s ok. All you have to do is read them both and pick the one you find more appealing, for whatever reason. Your decision might be based on a single word that you happen to like. It doesn&#x27;t matter. Just pick whichever one strikes your fancy.&quot; The original poems were constructed from a group of 1,000 words selected from such sources as &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Iliad&quot;. After few years of interbreeding, poems such as the following two began to emerge.

==&quot;Poem #18118&quot; (generation 13)==

&quot;the beautiful the frozen&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;hour of our other lie&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;temple lost music&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;just later from&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;shouting while in doomed nothingness was&quot;

&quot;spent waves sang&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;beating pointed time and&quot;

&lt;br&gt;&quot;revealing&quot;

<doc id="528933" wikidata="Q4993727" url="?curid=528933" title="Cemetery Hill">
<text>Cemetery Hill is a landform on the Gettysburg Battlefield that was the scene of fighting each day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1–3, 1863). The northernmost part of the Army of the Potomac defensive &quot;fish-hook&quot; line, the hill is gently sloped and provided a site for American Civil War artillery (cf. the heavily wooded, adjacent Culp&#x27;s Hill).

==Plan==
Cemetery Hill overlooks the main downtown area of Gettysburg from the south, at above sea level, above the town center, about above Winebrenner&#x27;s Run at its base. Its crest extends in a southwest–northeast direction for about . A shallow saddle on the crest about from its northeast slope is the point where the Baltimore Pike crosses the hill and separates East Cemetery Hill from the remainder. The slopes to the north and west rise gradually; on East Cemetery Hill, the rise is steeper. The hill is crossed by the Baltimore Pike and the Emmitsburg Road, with the Taneytown Road between them.

==History==

The 1858 south boundary for the Gettysburg borough extended southeast from the Emmitsburg Road to the Cemetery Hill summit on the Taneytown Rd, then northeast across the Baltimore Pike summit to the hill&#x27;s base, then northward to Winebrenner Run. On the south slope of Cemetery Hill (originally named Raffensperger&#x27;s Hill, after farmer Peter Raffensperger, who owned over on the eastern slope) is the 1854 Evergreen Cemetery and its 1855 gatehouse used as a headquarters during the battle.

On June 26, 1863, prior to the Battle of Gettysburg, Lt. Col. Elijah V. White&#x27;s Confederate cavalry occupied the hill and captured several horses hidden by local citizens, then departed to York County, Pennsylvania. The Gettysburg Railroad Station telegraph was subsequently moved to Cemetery Hill. The hill remained essentially free of military forces until the arrival of the Army of the Potomac.

===Battle of Gettysburg, First Day===
On July 1, 1863, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard left infantry and artillery to hold the hill in case the army needed to fall back from its positions north and west of Gettysburg. Cemetery Hill became the rallying point for retreating Union troops of the I Corps and XI Corps (from fighting north and northwest of town). One of the great controversies of the battle was the failure of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, and his subordinate, Brig. Gen. William &quot;Extra Billy&quot; Smith, to attack and capture Cemetery Hill. Smith thought Union troops were approaching from the east, which caused Early to delay his attack on the hill to defend against the supposed threat. There proved to be no significant Union troop movements from the east, and Smith was the only brigadier general not commended by Early after the battle.

===Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day===


On July 2, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered attacks on both ends of the Union line. Lt. Gen. James Longstreet attacked with his First Corps on the Union left (Little Round Top, Devil&#x27;s Den, Wheatfield). Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell and the Second Corps were assigned the mission of launching a simultaneous demonstration against the Union right, a minor attack that was intended to distract and pin down the Union defenders against Longstreet. Ewell was to exploit any success his demonstration might achieve by following up with a full-scale attack at his discretion.

Ewell began his demonstration at 4 p.m. upon hearing the sound of Longstreet&#x27;s guns to the south. For three hours, he chose to limit his demonstration to an artillery barrage from Benner&#x27;s Hill, about a mile (1,600 m) to the northeast. Although the Union defenders on Cemetery Hill received some damage from this fire, they returned counterbattery fire with a vengeance. Cemetery Hill is over taller than Benner&#x27;s Hill, and the geometry of artillery science meant that the Union gunners had a decided advantage. Ewell&#x27;s four batteries were forced to withdraw with heavy losses, and his best artillerist, 19-year-old Joseph W. Latimer, the &quot;Boy Major&quot;, was mortally wounded.

Around 7 p.m., as the Confederate assaults on the Union left and center were petering out, Ewell chose to begin his main infantry assault. He sent three brigades from the division of Maj. Gen. Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson across Rock Creek and up the eastern slope of Culp&#x27;s Hill against a line of breastworks manned by the XII Corps brigade of Brig. Gen. George S. Greene. Greene&#x27;s men held off the Confederate attack for hours, although the attackers were able to establish a foothold in some abandoned Union rifle pits. The fighting on Culp&#x27;s Hill would resume the following day.

Not long after the assault on Culp&#x27;s Hill began, as dusk fell around 7:30 p.m., Ewell sent two brigades from the division of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early against East Cemetery Hill from the east, and he alerted the division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes to prepare a follow-up assault against Cemetery Hill proper from the northwest. The two brigades from Early&#x27;s division were commanded by Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays: his own Louisiana Tigers Brigade and Hoke&#x27;s Brigade, the latter commanded by Col. Isaac E. Avery. They stepped off from a line parallel to Winebrenner&#x27;s Run, a narrow tributary of Rock Creek to the southeast of town. Hays commanded five Louisiana regiments, which together numbered only about 1,200 officers and men. Avery had three North Carolina regiments totaling 900. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon was in support behind Hays and Avery but did not participate in the fighting.
Defending East Cemetery Hill were the two brigades (Cols. Andrew L. Harris and Leopold von Gilsa) of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow&#x27;s division (now commanded by Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames) of the XI Corps. Both had seen heavy action on July 1 and they consisted of, respectively, 650 and 500 officers and men. Harris&#x27;s men were stationed at a low stone wall on the northern end of the hill and wrapped around onto Brickyard Lane at the base of the hill. (Brickyard Lane was also known at the time as Winebrenner&#x27;s Lane and today is named Wainwright Avenue.) Von Gilsa&#x27;s brigade was scattered along the lane as well as on the hill. Two regiments, the 41st New York and the 33rd Massachusetts, were stationed in Culp&#x27;s Meadow beyond Brickyard Lane in expectation of an attack by Johnson&#x27;s division. More westerly on the hill were the divisions of Maj. Gens. Adolph von Steinwehr and Carl Schurz. Col. Charles S. Wainwright, nominally of the I Corps, commanded the artillery batteries on the hill and on Stevens Knoll. The relatively steep slope of East Cemetery Hill made artillery fire difficult to direct against infantry because the gun barrels could not be depressed sufficiently, but they did their best with canister and double canister fire.
The Confederate attack began with a Rebel yell against the Ohio regiments at the stone wall. Just beforehand, Ames had sent the 17th Connecticut from its place on the left of the line to a position in the center. This left a gap, which Hays&#x27;s Louisianans exploited, and they bounded over the stone wall. Other troops exploited other weak spots in the line, and soon some of the Confederates had reached the batteries at the top of the hill, while others fought in the darkness with the four remaining Union regiments on the line behind the stone wall. On the crest of the hill, the gunners of Captain Michael Wiedrich&#x27;s New York battery and Captain R. Bruce Ricketts&#x27;s Pennsylvania battery engaged in hand-to-hand combat against the invaders. Major Samuel Tate of the 6th North Carolina wrote afterward:

Harry Pfanz provides an alternative view that contrasts with Tate&#x27;s: &quot;Although the Confederates wrote and spoke of occupying the crest of the hill and capturing the batteries there, Union accounts concede less Confederate success. The sparse accounts of Wiedrich&#x27;s battery say that the Confederates attacked suddenly and violently and entered the battery&#x27;s position but insist that they were there only briefly.&quot; The collapse of &quot;Cemetery Hill, the keystone of the Union line,&quot; &quot;would have certainly required Meade to at least abandon his position&quot; at Gettysburg, but the following day, artillery anchored here aided the repulse of the famous attack by Pickett, Pettigrew, Trimble, Wilcox &amp; Lang.
Generals Howard and Schurz heard the commotion and rushed the 58th and 119th New York of Col. Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski&#x27;s brigade from West Cemetery Hill to the aid of Wiedrich&#x27;s battery. Howard&#x27;s lines were getting thin, so he sent for help to Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock of the II Corps. Hancock ordered one of his brigades under Col. Samuel S. Carroll to rush from Cemetery Ridge and assist the defenders. They arrived at the double-quick, charging through the dark from the cemetery, just as the Confederate attack was starting to ebb. Carroll&#x27;s men secured Ricketts&#x27;s battery and swept the North Carolinians down the hill. Over at Wiedrich&#x27;s battery, Krzyżanowski led his men to sweep the Louisiana attackers down the hill until they reached the base and &quot;flopped down&quot; for Wiedrich&#x27;s guns to fire canister at the retreating Confederates.

Defending East Cemetery Hill would have been much more difficult had the overall attack been better coordinated. To the northwest, Maj. Gen. Robert Rodes&#x27;s division was not ready to attack until Early&#x27;s fight was almost over. It had filed west from the town and into the fields along the dirt path that is now Long Lane, where it stopped after advancing a short distance in the darkness. Brig. Gen. Dodson Ramseur, the leading brigade commander, saw the futility of a night assault against two lines of Union troops behind stone walls, backed up by significant artillery. Rodes&#x27;s after-battle report also expressed concern about a lack of cooperation from the adjoining division on A.P. Hill&#x27;s left flank. Maj. Gen. William Dorsey Pender had been wounded by a shell that afternoon and Brig. Gen. James H. Lane was in command of Pender&#x27;s division. Ewell sent a staff officer to speak with Lane, who explained that his orders were to attack if a &quot;favorable opportunity presented.&quot; When Ewell informed Lane that his attack was starting and requested cooperation, Lane sent back no reply.

Losses on both sides were severe; among the casualties was Col. Avery, who was struck in the neck by a musket ball, felling him from his horse, where he was discovered after the charge by several of his soldiers and Major Tate of the 6th North Carolina. Unable to speak from his mortal wound, Avery scribbled a simple note for Tate: &quot;Major, tell my father I died with my face to the enemy. I. E. Avery.&quot; He died the following day.

===Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day===
On July 3, there was no infantry attack on Cemetery Hill; the primary Confederate attacks were on Culp&#x27;s Hill and on the lower portion of Cemetery Ridge. Union cannons on Cemetery Hill counter fired on the Confederate artillery barrage that preceded Pickett&#x27;s Charge and provided antipersonnel support fire during the Confederate infantry attack. National Park Service historian Troy Harman has written that Robert E. Lee&#x27;s ultimate objective for the assaults by Longstreet on July 2 and July 3 was actually Cemetery Hill, rolling the Union left flank up Cemetery Ridge.

===Aftermath===

Post-battle, East Cemetery Hill was occupied for several weeks by state militiamen, who established a tented camp site to maintain a military presence, secure the battlefield from looters and curiosity seekers, collect remaining military weapons, and provide manpower and services for the area&#x27;s hospitals. Elizabeth C. Thorn (pregnant wife of the keeper of Evergreen Cemetery who was at war), her parents, and hired hands dug 105 graves for soldiers killed at or near Cemetery Hill.

The Gettysburg National Cemetery was established in 1863 north of the Evergreen Cemetery. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address was delivered there during the Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg.

===Postbellum history===
The 1867 National Homestead at Gettysburg operated as an orphanage at the north foot of the hill, and an 1878 wooden observation tower of East Cemetery Hill had been built near the monument for Battery B, Pennsylvania Light Artillery. The 1893–1917 Gettysburg Electric Railway was on several sides of the hill, and the 1921–2008 Gettysburg National Museum operated on the west side of Cemetery Hill along the Taneytown Road. The areas on the northern and western slopes of the hill are now largely occupied by tourist-related businesses (hotels, restaurants, gift shops, battlefield tour agencies, private museums, etc.). The military importance of the heights is not as evident today since the once commanding view has been blocked by this sprawl.

<text>The Voronezh (, ), also romanized as Voronež, is a river in Tambov, Lipetsk, and Voronezh oblasts in Russia, a left tributary of the Don. The Voronezh is long, with a drainage basin of . It freezes up in the first half of December and stays under the ice until late March. The lower reaches of the river are navigable. The cities of Lipetsk and Voronezh are along the Voronezh River.

Going upstream, it leaves the Don south of Voronezh and goes north parallel and east of the Don for about . West of Michurinsk it swings east and splits into the Lesnoy and Polny Voronezh Rivers (&quot;Forest and Field Voronezh&quot;). These go north about to the border of Ryazan Oblast. To the north are tributaries of the Oka. To the east are the basins of the south-flowing Bityug which joins the Don and the north-flowing Tsna which reaches the Oka via the Moksha. 

The river is named for an earlier town destroyed by the Mongol invasion, whose name in turn was borrowed from a place name in the Principality of Chernigov, derived from the personal name Voroneg. From the 1650s the Belgorod Line of forts ran along the Voronezh. In 1706 Peter the Great built boats along the Voronezh and sailed them down the Don to attack the Turkish fortress of Azov.

<doc id="528946" wikidata="Q295869" url="?curid=528946" title="Leland H. Hartwell">
<text>Leland Harrison &quot;Lee&quot; Hartwell (born October 30, 1939) is an American former president and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. He shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt, for their discoveries of protein molecules that control the division (duplication) of cells.

Working in yeast, Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle—the progression through G1.

==Education==
Hartwell attended Glendale High School in Glendale, California, and then received his Bachelor of Science from the California Institute of Technology in 1961. In 1964, he received his PhD in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1965 to 1968, he worked at the University of California, Irvine as a professor. He moved to the University of Washington in 1968. In a series of experiments from 1970 to 1971, Hartwell discovered the cell division cycle (&quot;CDC&quot;) genes in baker&#x27;s yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;). These genes regulate the cell cycle and mutations in the genes are involved in some types of cancer.

==Awards and honors==

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Hartwell has received awards and honors including the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1995. He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1987. In 1996, Hartwell joined the faculty of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and in 1997 became its president and director until he retired in 2010.

In 1998 he received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, and the Massry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California in 2000. On July 9, 2003, Washington Governor Gary Locke awarded the Medal of Merit, the state&#x27;s highest honor, to Hartwell. He is also a recipient of the Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction.

==Research==
His earliest publications focused on the isolation of temperature sensitive yeast mutants disabled in basic biological processes, including DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. This led to the identification of the CDC (Cell Division Cycle) genes, which function in promoting the progression through cell division, most notably CDC28, which encodes the yeast Cdk kinase. Other significant discoveries include introduction of the concept of cell cycle &quot;checkpoints&quot;, which delay cell division when cellular insults are generated and also the identification and characterization of the mating signal transduction pathway.

==Other positions==

Hartwell is the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Canary Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to developing new technologies for the early detection of cancer. He is also a founding co-chair of the Pacific Health Summit, and a member of its executive committee. In September 2009, it was announced that Hartwell would join the faculty of Arizona State University as the Virginia G. Piper Chair of Personalized Medicine and co-director of the Biodesign Institute&#x27;s Center for Sustainable Health with Dr. Michael Birt. He is also adjunct faculty at Amrita University in India.

== Lee Hartwell Award ==

This award is given to scientists whose research in yeast has made the most impact in the broader areas of biology. Recipients of the award also give a lecture at the biennial Yeast Genetics Meeting.

<text>Tambov ( , ; ) is a city and the administrative center of Tambov Oblast, central Russia, at the confluence of the Tsna and Studenents rivers, about south-southeast of Moscow. With a population of 261,803 as of 2021, Tambov is the largest city, and historical center, of the Tambov Oblast as a whole.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tambov&quot; originates from a Mokshan word ().

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
In terms of its layout, Tambov was no different from other fortified cities – the Kremlin, the prison and a small settlement. The chosen place was in full compliance with the requirements of the fortification. From the north and east, the new fortress was washed by rivers, and from the west and south it was protected by artificial ditches filled with water by the Studenets River. The Kremlin was surrounded by a six-meter wooden wall with 12 towers, from the south-west it was adjoined by a prison, also surrounded by a wall, and beyond the river there was a settlement. A church, a voivode&#x27;s house, several administrative buildings and a mobile cellar were built inside the Kremlin. The Cossacks who were serving lived in a prison, and trading shops soon opened up here. Craftsmen settled on the posad.

As the urban area grew, settlements began to appear, where service people settled – Pushkarskaya, Streletskaya, Polkovaya. Peasants settled in Pokrovskaya Sloboda. The central part of the city was occupied by the former Kremlin and posad. There were streets in the Kremlin: Lipetskaya, Namestnicheskaya, Penzenskaya, crossing Bolshaya Astrakhanskaya street. Shirokaya, Dvoryanskaya, Monastyrskaya and Streletskaya streets appeared in the posad. The Pokrovskaya Sloboda included Seminarskaya, Pokrovskaya, Nachalnaya s Odnodvorcheskaya streets. It was the southern outskirts of the 18th-century city. Behind the Varvara Church was Invalidnaya Sloboda. In the northern part of the city in the 18th century, across the Studenets River, there were Pushkarskaya and Polkovaya settlements. They were separated by a small river Gavryushka. As the borders of the Russian state advanced to the south, Tambov lost its importance as a military guard fortress by the end of the 17th century. The city was increasingly becoming a transit trade center. By that time, there were three districts on the territory of Tambov. The Kremlin remained a place of concentration of military and administrative power. Ostrog acquired trade functions: there were shops, a kruzhniy yard and a customs hut. Posad became a place for the development of crafts and the construction of grain warehouses. The defensive structures of the city were renewed again in 1738, when it was ordered to fix and re-equip the Tambov fortress in connection with the outbreak of the Russian-Turkish war. However, the city did not acquire military significance. In 1779, the Tambov governorship was formed, later renamed to the province.

For about 150 years since its establishment in 1636, Tambov freely developed around the fortress, which stood at the bend of the Tsna River, and was divided into two parts by the Studenets River. By that time, there were settlements here: Cossack (Streletskaya), Pushkarskaya, Storozhevaya (Kazachya, Казачья), Polkovaya, Panskaya and Pokrovskaya.

The city&#x27;s layout began to change after 1781. As part of the redevelopment of the Russian cities at the 18th century the new system of provincial cities was to be embodied in their newest appearance – in the spatial and architectural order, expressed in geometric correctness and regularity of the international style of classicism, in contrast to the previously existing picturesque structure, which began to be perceived as a mess. The general plan of Tambov was approved on December 9, 1781, by Catherine II. The urban planning document was aimed at clearing the urban space of old, random buildings, freely located, and creating an ordered grid-structure with geometrically regular lines of houses and straight streets. In 1781, Governor-General Roman Illarionovich Vorontsov was invited to Tambov from St. Petersburg to the newly opened position of the provincial architect from the &quot;soldiers&#x27; children&quot; of the collegiate registrar Vasily Antonovich Usachev, who became the coordinator of the implementation of Tambov&#x27;s urban planning plan. The streets of the city center were based on the old roads that formed around the fortifications of the fortress, erected in 1636 under the governor Roman Boborykin. The central axis of the foundation of the oldest building in Tambov, the Transfiguration Cathedral now does not fit into the regular plan of the central part of Tambov, recalling the initial originality of the space of the fortified city. A number of longitudinal streets appeared: First and Second Dolgie (Dolovye Streets) and Obvodnaya, which along the river valley. Rzhavets circled the western part of the city. From Tambov there were roads to Penza and the district towns of Kozlov, Morshansk, Lipetsk. Streets sprout along these roads. Kuzminskaya Street led out through the village. Kuzminka on the Astrakhan tract. Noblemen settled on the central cross street. The street is named Shirokaya Dvoryanskaya. In the shopping districts of the city, Khlebnaya Square was formed, it is bordered by Khlebnaya and Muchnaya streets. Near Sennaya (later Bazaar) squares are formed from the east by Proyezhaya, and from the west – by Vyez&#x27;zhaya streets. The outskirts of the streets were inhabited by petty officials – clerks and odnodvorets, which was reflected in their names. The southern part of the city was built up at the beginning of the 19th century. New, First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth streets appear here, and later – Kirpichnaya, Kamennaya and Invalidnaya streets.

==History==

Tambov was founded by the decree of Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich on April 17, 1636 (Old Style). Originally, it was a border fortress against attacks by the Crimean Tatars, but it soon declined in importance as a military outpost. It then became the region&#x27;s administrative and trade centre.

In the first half of the 17th century, the Tsardom of Russia created the Belgorosk defensive line to protect the lands from the raids of nomads and to strengthen the southern borders. Together with other cities, a fortress city of Tambov was built on it, the foundation of which dates back to 1636. The diploma of Mikhail Fyodorovich issued on April 17, 1636 (Old Style) reads: &quot;To put from Shatskiy Ukraine, on the field, on the Tsna river, at the mouth of the Lipovitsa river the city of Tambov, and in it to arrange service people.&quot; The original name of the city was spelled &quot;Tonbov&quot; and was associated with the supposed site of the fortress on the Lipovitsa River opposite the Mordovian village of Tonbov and the river of the same name. But the city was founded in another place, downstream of the Tsna River, at the mouth of the Studenets River. The head of the construction and the first voivode of the new fortress, stolnik Roman Boborykin, chose a place for the fortress more suitable in military and commercial terms. From the first years of its existence, Crimean and Nogai Tatars attacked Tambov more than once. The Tambov garrison successfully repelled almost all the attacks of the steppe inhabitants, but there were also failures. So, in the spring of 1644, the Tatars who suddenly attacked the city managed to capture 20 Cossacks, and during the pursuit another 30 warriors died. For ten years the city fortifications collapsed and fell into disrepair. In 1647, construction of ready-made defensive structures began in Tambov, which lasted for seven years. The Kremlin was reequipped with new cannons sent from Tula, a new cellar and &quot;sovereign&#x27;s grain stores&quot; were erected in it to store grain supplies and other products in case of a siege. During the Azov campaigns, the city became the site of the formation of military units that left for Azov. As a district town, Tambov is attributed to the Azov province in 1708. 

In 1719 it became the main city of the then-established Tambov province. The province became part of the Azov province, which in 1732 was renamed after its capital city, Voronezh. Trade routes passed through Tambov, connecting it with Moscow, the cities of the Black Earth Region and the Volga Region. The roads were served by about 500 Tambov coachmen, but farmers remained the main population of the city. Due to the large amount of unplowed land in the Tambov province, animal husbandry developed widely, and with it trade in livestock and especially wool, which was in high demand in the Russian markets. Tambov wool became the reason for the creation of the first cloth factories in Tambov.

However, the administrative and commercial functions of the city were not in line with the slow economic growth of Tambov. In terms of the number of townspeople, it lagged behind many provincial centers such as Oryol, Kursk and Voronezh. In the 1780s things began to change when poet and statesman Gavrila Derzhavin was appointed as the governor. He proved himself to be an excellent administrator and expert in the economy of the region entrusted to him. Derzhavin made his apartment a place for public meetings, concerts, and even a school for children and youth, in which arithmetic and grammar were taught. Derzhavin took care of the establishment in the city of a club and boarding school for children of the nobility. With the assistance of the educator Nikolay Novikov, he opened a printing house in Tambov, where the first local newspaper, secular books and translations of foreign novels began to be published. A theater, a public school with a four-year period of study was opened in the city, preparations were made for the compilation and publication of a topographic description of the entire governorship. Derzhavin put a lot of effort into the development of navigation along the Tsna, and the river sluice proposed by him made it possible to deliver timber and building stone to Tambov, which the city had previously been deprived of. With his resignation, many projects that contributed to the development and improvement of Tambov were never completed. Only in 1822, almost 40 years later, the paving of the Tambov streets began, for which the stone, prepared during Derzhavin times, was used.

Roman Boborykin, the emperor&#x27;s court menial (&quot;stolnik&quot;) and voivode was the town&#x27;s first builder. Thanks to his experience, the fortress was completed rapidly. Tambov was granted city status in 1719. 

In 1779, Tambov Viceroyalty was formed, and on August 16, 1781, Empress Catherine the Great approved the city&#x27;s coat of arms depicting a beehive, symbolizing the town&#x27;s hardworking residents. This viceroyalty was formed from southern parts of Ryazan Viceyorality and northern parts of Voronezh Viceyorality. In March 1786, the disgraced Russian poet and statesman Gavrila Derzhavin was appointed the governor of Tambov Governorate—a post that he held until December 1788. Even during that brief tenure, he accomplished a great deal: a theatre, a college, a dancing school, a printing business, an orchestra, and a brickyard were built. Tambov later erected a monument to Derzhavin.

In November 1830, during the Cholera Riots in Russia, the citizens of Tambov attacked their governor, but they were soon suppressed by the regular army. Later in the 19th century, Tambov became a significant cultural centre that supported a growing number of schools, libraries, and other institutions. By 1897, its population was more than 50,000 people.

During the Civil War, in 1920–1921, the region witnessed the Tambov Rebellion—a bitter struggle between local residents and the Bolshevik Red Army. In 1921, a Tambov Republic was established, but it was soon crushed by the Red Army under the command of Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Between 1928 and 1934, Tambov became okrug centre in Central Black Earth Oblast. After dissolving the oblast on June 13, 1934, it became the raion center in Voronezh Oblast. Tambov finally became the centre of Tambov Oblast, which was created from oblasts of Voronezh and Kuybyshev on September 27, 1937. The oblast had present form after separation of Penza Oblast (formerly part of Kuybyshev one) on February 4, 1939.

During and after World War II, most of the &quot;Malgré-nous&quot; prisoners of war (Frenchmen from annexed Alsace and Moselle who were conscripted in the Wehrmacht) were jailed in &quot;Camp #188&quot; at Tambov. Between 4,000 and 10,000 of them died in this camp. In 1991, a high guyed television antenna was built in Tambov.

During the Russo-Ukrainian War, a drone was reported to have struck a gunpowder factory in Tambov.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Tambov serves as the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Tambovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Tambov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Tambov is incorporated as Tambov Urban Okrug.

==Transportation==
The city is a large industrial center and is served by Tambov Donskoye Airport. Tambov is also the location of the Tambov air base of the Russian Air Force. A railway connection between Tambov and Moscow was first established in 1871. The railroad goes on to Saratov and is not electrified. There are also small suburban trains, or &quot;rail buses&quot; that connect Tambov Oblast&#x27;s capital with other cities, such as Michurinsk, Uvarovo, and Kirsanov.

==Climate==
Tambov has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). The average temperature of the coldest month (February) is about -8 °C, the warmest month (July) – about +20 °C. Because of the southerly location the average annual temperature in Tambov is about 2 degrees higher than in Moscow. Annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 650 mm, more than half of them (about 270 mm) of precipitation falls in the warm season. Duration of the warm period is 154 days.

==Culture==
The city is home to two universities, Derzhavin Tambov State University and Tambov State Technical University. The Tambov Art Gallery houses a vast collection of canvases by Russian and West-European artists. Russia&#x27;s oldest drama theater is located in Tambov, as well as two universities, two military colleges, a musical school, a museum of local lore, and other cultural institutions.

In the Russian popular culture has long had a reputation of a gloomy city dangerous for living (which is only partly related to the notorious Tambov Mafia). Since recently, the Tambov Wolf became the city&#x27;s icon; its origin goes back to the proverb &quot;A wolf from Tambov is your comrade&quot; (i.e. you are no friend to me, you have nothing to do with me).
==Sports==
Tambov&#x27;s professional association football team FC Tambov played in the Russian Premier League for 2 years, before dissolving in 2021.

==Etymology==
The name of the river (as well as the Oka tributary of the same name) is usually derived from the Baltic *tasna, comparing it with Prussian *tusnan &quot;quiet&quot;. Less popular is the version of origin from the Old Russian *dysna &quot;right&quot;, bringing together the name with the hydronym of the Desna.

==Description==
A calm, flat river, heavily regulated by dams, navigable in places from Tambov itself. The list of inland waterways in Russia includes a section from the mouth to the village of Ten&#x27;siupino with a length of 47 km (2002). The left bank is treeless, heavily populated, but the villages are mostly 1–3 km from the river. Along the right bank almost everywhere there is a forest belt, but it comes to the water only in certain places, as it was cut down during the Great Patriotic War.

On the bank of the Tsna River there is the Holy Spring, known in Tambov and the nearest regions, located in the village of Treguliai. In the summer, many people come there to drink from the spring or bathe.

The Tsna below Tambov is a meandering calm river, 40–80 m wide, flowing along a wide valley with a lot of creeks, a stream where you can go fishing. On the banks of the reeds, thickets of bush. Water is markedly polluted.

From Tambov to Morshansk there are 5 dams with locks. The first - in the village of Tambov Forestry. The second one is near the village of Goreloe. Behind her, the river makes a long loop. Near the village of Troitskaya Dubrava is the third gateway. Behind the village of Kuleshovo is an oak forest. The forest comes to the shore and near the village of Perkino. In the city of Tambov in 1912 was built the first in the Tambov region a small hydroelectric station.

Below Perkino begins the Semikinskiy Canal, which significantly shortens the way for Tsna. In the floodplain of Tsna near Perkino, Semikino and below - the labyrinths of overgrown with old reeds.

Below the village of Semikino - Lake Lebyazhye and Orekhov Zaton - the largest floodplain lakes on the river Tsna. Below the Lake Orekhov Zaton on the high right bank is a natural species platform, from where the panorama of the village of Kulevatovo, the floodplain of the Tsna River, the mouth of the Chelnovoi River comes off.

The fourth dam is behind the village of Mamontovo, the fifth - in Morshansk.

Below Morshansk, Tsna becomes wider, the current is faster, beaches with small, sometimes silty, sand appear. The shores are mainly meadow, only near Mutasievo on the right bank of the wedge is the forest to which the creek leads.

Before the village Serpovoe - the sixth dam. Ten kilometers from the dam after the mouth of the Serp tributary on the right high bank is a pine forest. At local residents this tract is called the Serpovsky Utesom.

Pine forest, reaching the river, there is also in front of the Rysly; Behind the village there is a floating bridge. The village of Chernitovo is a dam. Behind the dam on the banks again meadows. The river becomes wide (from 100 to 200 m).

Before the last dam (HPP), the river forms a reservoir with a length of about 6 km and a width of 0.5 km.

The dam is also in the area of the villages Aglomazovo and Tenshupino, where the river spills about 1 km. But after the reconstruction of the dam, the dam began to collapse year after year, and now the river has become much shallow.

Below the dam, the channel of the Tsna is narrowed to 40–50 m, the current accelerates, sandy rifts appear. The forest approaches the water in the form of separate islands. In Soviet times, the river was used for navigation, along the entire length of the shipping section from Tambov. For passenger navigation, air-cushion ships (SVPs) of the Zarnitsa type were used.

Widely used by tourists for rafting.

<text>Mount Nebo (; ) is an elevated ridge located in Jordan, approximately above sea level. Part of the Abarim mountain range, Mount Nebo is mentioned in the Bible as the place where Moses was granted a view of the Promised Land before his death. The view from the summit provides a panorama of the West Bank across the Jordan River valley. The city of Jericho is usually visible from the summit, as is Jerusalem on a very clear day. The biblical town of Nebo, now known as Khirbet al-Mukhayyat, is located 3.5 km (2.1 mi) away.

==Religious significance==
According to the Bible (Deuteronomy), Moses ascended Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab (today in Jordan), and from there he saw the Land of Canaan (the Promised Land), which God had said he would not enter; Moses then died there. The Bible () says Moses&#x27; burial place was unknown. A monument atop Mount Nebo commemorates Moses&#x27; death after seeing Canaan, across the Jordan valley. A purported grave of Moses is located at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, in the West Bank, south of Jericho and east of Jerusalem.

Mount Nebo is then mentioned again in 2 Maccabees (), when the prophet Jeremiah hid the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant in a cave there.

A Christian church from Byzantine times stands on the top of Mount Nebo.

On March 20, 2000, Pope John Paul II visited the summit of Mount Nebo during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During his visit, he planted an olive tree next to the Byzantine chapel, as a symbol of peace. Pope Benedict XVI visited the site in 2009, gave a speech, and looked out from the top of the mountain in the direction of Jerusalem.

A serpentine cross sculpture atop Mount Nebo was created by Italian artist Gian Paolo Fantoni. It is symbolic of the miracle of the bronze serpent invoked by Moses in the wilderness () and the cross upon which Jesus was crucified ().

==Archaeology==

Systematic exploration begun by Sylvester J. Saller O.F.M. was continued in 1933 by Jerome Mihaic of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum. On the highest point of the mountain, Syagha, the remains of a Byzantine church and monastery were discovered in 1933. The church was first constructed in the second half of the 4th century to commemorate the place of Moses&#x27; death. The church design follows a typical basilica pattern. It was enlarged in the late fifth century AD and rebuilt in AD 597. The church is first mentioned in an account of a pilgrimage made by a lady Aetheria in AD 394. Six tombs have been found hollowed from the natural rock beneath the mosaic-covered floor of the church.

Bellarmino Bagatti worked on the site in 1935. Virgilio Canio Corbo later excavated the interior of the basilica.

==History of the modern Memorial of Moses==
The ancient church, a pilgrimage destination since the 4th century, was excavated between 1933 and 1938 by Sylvester Saller, bringing to light the basilica with its chapels and the annexes of the monastery. The exquisite mosaics were then covered back with soil for protection. In 1963, the Custody of the Holy Land decided to restore the mosaic floors and Virgilio Corbo was put in charge of the project. A metal shelter designed in Oxford was erected over the ruins, but work was interrupted by the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Renewed work ensued between 1976-1984, when a new mosaic was discovered in the diaconicon-baptistery. By 1984 the consolidation work was completed, and as a result, the basilica could be used both for liturgical purposes, as well as for displaying the restored mosaics, either in situ or mounted on the walls. After renewed plans drawn in 1989 and geological surveys and assessments of the ancient and modern structures made a decade later, a new shelter, basically a complete basilica was built over the ancient church between December 2007 and the reopening day on 15 October 2016. Not even the sudden death of Michelle Piccirillo, a key figure in the project, in October 2008, led to a break in the work.

==Exhibited mosaics==
In the modern chapel presbytery, built to protect the site and provide worship space, remnants of mosaic floors from different periods can be seen. The earliest of these is a panel with a braided cross presently placed on the east end of the south wall.

<doc id="528968" wikidata="Q4872617" url="?curid=528968" title="Battle of Two Sisters">
<text>The Battle of Two Sisters was an engagement of the Falklands War during the British advance towards the capital, Port Stanley. It took place from 11 to 12 June 1982 and was one of three battles in a Brigade-size operation all on the same night, the other two being the Battle of Mount Longdon and the Battle of Mount Harriet. Fought mainly between an assaulting British force consisting of Royal Marines of 45 Commando and an Argentine Company drawn from 4th Infantry Regiment (&quot;Regimiento de Infantería 4&quot; or RI 4).

One of a number of night battles that took place during the British advance towards Stanley, the battle led to British troops capturing all the heights above the town, allowing its capture and the surrender of the Argentine forces on the islands.

==Prelude==
===Composition of forces===
The British force, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Whitehead, consisted of the Royal Marines of 45 Commando, the anti-tank troop form 40 Commando with support from six 105-mm guns of 29 Commando Regiment. The 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (2 Para), was held in reserve. Naval gunfire support was provided by HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot;&#x27;s twin 4.5-inch (114 mm) guns.

45 Commando was instructed to seize Two Sisters Mountain under the cover of darkness and proceed onto Tumbledown Mountain if time allowed, but Argentine resistance was stiff enough to cancel the second phase of the attack.

The Argentinian force originally occupying Mount Challenger, commanded by Major Ricardo Cordón, consisted of the 4th Infantry Regiment (&quot;Regimiento de Infantería 4&quot; or RI 4), with the bulk of the defenders drawn from C Company with the 1st Platoon (Sub-Lieutenant Miguel Mosquera-Gutierrez) and 2nd Platoon (Sub-Lieutenant Jorge Pérez-Grandi) on the northern peak of Two Sisters and the 3rd Platoon (Sub-Lieutenant Marcelo Llambias Pravaz) on the southern peak and the 1st Platoon A Company (Sub-Lieutenant Juan Nazer) and Support Platoon (Second Lieutenant Luis Carlos Martella) on the saddle between the two. Major Óscar Jaimet&#x27;s B Company of the 6th Mechanized Infantry Regiment (&quot;Regimiento de Infantería Mecanizado 6&quot; RI Mec 6), acting as the local reserve, occupied the saddle between Two Sisters and Mount Longdon. In early June, Jaimet&#x27;s company would be reinforced with the Support Platoon under Second Lieutenant Marcelo Dorigón from the 12th Regiment&#x27;s B Company who had been left behind on Mount Kent, after RI 12&#x27;s B Company had been helicoptered forward as reinforcements during the Battle of Goose Green.

On 2 June, the 4th Regiment&#x27;s Operation Officer, Captain Carlos Alfredo López Patterson, arrived to help in the defence of Two Sisters. He would visit the rifle platoons in order to maintain the defenders informed and raise morale:

On 4 June, the three rifle companies of 45 CDO advanced on Bluff Cove Peak, on the lower slopes of Mount Kent, and were able to occupy the feature without opposition and were met by patrols from the Special Air Service (SAS). On the night of 29 May, a fierce firefight had developed over capturing the two important hills, as they were intended to form part of an Argentine Special Forces line.

Captain Andrés Ferrero&#x27;s patrol (3rd Assault Section, 602 Commando Company) reached the base of Mount Kent but were then promptly pinned down by machinegun and mortar fire. First-Sergeant Raimundo Máximo Viltes was badly wounded when a bullet shattered his heel. Air Troop had two SAS men wounded by rifle fire. Probing attacks around the D Squadron, SAS positions continued throughout the night and at 11:00 am local time on 30 May, about 12 Argentine Commandos (Captain Tomás Fernández&#x27;s 2nd Assault Section, 602 Commando Company) tried to get up the summit of Bluff Cove Peak, but were driven off by D Squadron who killed two of the attackers, First Lieutenant Rubén Eduardo Márquez and Sergeant Óscar Humberto Blas.

First Lieutenant Márquez and Sergeant Blas had shown great personal courage and leadership in the contact and were posthumously awarded the Argentine Medal of Valour in Combat. During this contact, the SAS suffered another two casualties from grenades after the Argentine Commandos had stumbled on a camp occupied by 15 SAS troopers.

Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, responding to a call for help from D Squadron SAS, was badly damaged by small arms fire while attacking Mount Kent&#x27;s eastern lower slopes. Sub-Lieutenant Llambías-Pravaz&#x27;s platoon was later credited with the destruction of Harrier XZ963 flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pookwith another claim going to 35 mm Oerlikons of the 601st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Roberto Enrique Ferre. The Harrier crashed into the South Atlantic 30 miles from the carrier HMS Hermes, Squadron Leader Pook ejected and was rescued.

On 5 June, two Royal Air Force Harriers operating from &#x27;Sids Strip&#x27;, the San Carlos Forward Operating Base, attacked the Argentine defenders on Two Sisters with rockets around midday.

A heavy mist hung over the Murrell River area, which assisted the 45 Commando Recce Troop to reach and sometimes penetrate the Argentine 3rd Platoon position under Sub-Lieutenant Marcelo Llambías-Pravaz. Marine Andrew Tubb of Recce Troop was on these patrols:

For his patrol action, Lieutenant Chris Fox received the Military Cross, while &quot;Subteniente&quot; Llambías-Pravaz was able to pilfer and sport a Commando Beret that the Royal Marines had left behind during the Argentine counter ambush.
In general terms, the Argentines were thoroughly entrenched, about 6,000 metres or less across no-man&#x27;s-land. The Argentine positions were mined and heavily patrolled.

The 4th Regiment also carried out patrolling, and on the night of 6–7 June, Corporal Oscar Nicolás Albornoz-Guevara along with eight conscripts (including Private Orlando Héctor Stella, his pathfinder) from &quot;Subteniente&quot; Miguel Mosquera-Gutierrez&#x27;s 1st Platoon crossed Murrell River and reached the area of Estancia Mountain where they detected a number of British vehicles, but the patrol soon came under mortar fire from 3 PARA and had to withdraw.

On 8 June, Corporal Hugo Gabino MacDougall from the 6th Regiment&#x27;s B Company claimed to have shot down a Harrier, with a shoulder-launched Blowpipe missile. The British admit the loss of a GR-3 Harrier (XZ-989) on this day when it made an emergency landing at San Carlos due to battle damage. The pilot (Wing Commander Peter Squire) was able to safely eject, but the Harrier was damaged beyond repair.

The 12th Regiment Support Platoon under &quot;Subteniente&quot; Dorigón attached to Major Jaimet&#x27;s B Company would reportedly live off the land. Private Ángel Ramírez: 
 
At about 2.10 am local time on 10 June a strong 45 Commando fighting patrol probed the 3rd Platoon position. In the ensuing fight, Special Forces Sergeants Mario Antonio Cisneros and Ramón Gumercindo Acosta were killed; two more Argentine Special Forces lying in ambush for the Royal Marines were wounded. The British military historian Bruce Quarrie later wrote:

Major Aldo Rico, commander of the 602 Commando Company, had a lucky escape in this engagement, when an enemy 66mm projectile exploded uncomfortably close to him and First Lieutenant Horacio Fernando Lauría. Captain Hugo Ranieri, who took part in this intense engagement as a specialist sniper, claims that First Lieutenant Jorge Vizoso-Posse, although wounded, shot three of the retreating Royal Marines in the back. First Lieutenant Horacio Fernando Lauría and Sergeant Orlando Aguirre claim to have destroyed a British machine-gun with rifle-grenades in this engagement.

On that same night (9–10 June), a friendly fire incident occurred when Royal Marines returning from a reconnaissance patrol were mistaken for Argentines in the dark and a British mortar team opened fire on them. In the confusion, four Royal Marines (Sergeant Robert Leeming, Corporals Andrew Uren, Peter Fitton and Marine Keith Phillips) were killed and three were wounded. 
The next day, Sub-Lieutenant Llambías-Pravaz&#x27;s men recovered the rucksacks and weapons the Royal Marines had left behind, and these were presented as war trophies to Argentine war correspondents in Port Stanley who filmed and photographed the British equipment.

The Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre also carried out patrolling against Two Sisters; Sergeant Joseph Wassell and Lieutenant Fraser Haddow played an important part in the capture of the mountain when they discovered with their binoculars from their observation post on Goat Ridge, the command-detonated barrels of mines the Argentinian Marine engineers (under the direction of Major Jaimet) had dug in and planned to use on the saddle and eastern half of the mountain.

On 11 June, several GR-3 Harriers took off from San Carlos airbase to drop cluster bombs on Mounts Longdon, Harriet and Two Sisters Mountain.

==Night battle==

Captain Ian Gardiner&#x27;s X-Ray Company spearheaded the attack on Two Sisters, accompanied by the unit&#x27;s Commando-trained chaplain, the Revd Wynne Jones RN. Lieutenant James Kelly&#x27;s 1 Troop took the western third of the spineback on the southern peak of Two Sisters (&#x27;Long Toenail&#x27;), with no fighting taking place. However at 11:00 pm local time, Lieutenant David Stewart&#x27;s 3 Troop ran up against a very determined defence on the spineback and were unable to get forward. Beaten from their attempt to dislodge the Argentine 3rd Platoon, Lieutenant Chris Caroe&#x27;s 2 Troop threw themselves at the platoon, but the attack was dispersed with the help of artillery fire. For three or four hours X Ray Company were pinned down on the slopes of the mountain. Naval gunfire rippled back and forth across the mountain, but the Argentine 3rd Platoon of Llambías-Pravaz, shouting their Guarani Indian war cry, held the Royal Marines off and were not dislodged until about 2:30 am local time. Colonel Andrew Whitehead realized that a single company could not hope to secure Two Sisters without massive casualties, and brought up the unit&#x27;s two other companies.

At about 12:30 am local time Yankee and Zulu Companies attacked the northern peak (&#x27;Summer Days&#x27;) and after a very hard two-hour fight against two rifle platoons (under &quot;Subtenientes&quot; Mosquera-Gutierrez and Pérez-Grandi) and despite heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, succeeded in capturing &#x27;Summer Days&#x27;. The Argentine mortar platoon commander, Lieutenant Martella, after having consumed all of his ammunition in an earlier attempt to stop the advance of 42 CDO on Mount Harriet was killed in this action. The British Marines also lost two platoon commanders wounded in the Argentine mortar bombardments with Marine Chris Cooke later recalling, &quot;The three officers in my company pledged to have a drink together at the other end of the island, but only one made it, the other two left with shrapnel wounds.&quot; The Z Company platoon commander, Lieutenant Clive Dytor, won the Military Cross by rallying his 8 Troop and leading it forward at bayonet point to take &#x27;Summer Days&#x27;. He later recalled &quot;I began listening to our rate of fire and I realised we were going to run out of ammunition. Then I remembered a line in a book about the Black Watch in the Second World War. They were pinned down and the adjutant stood up and shouted, &#x27;Is this the Black Watch? Charge!’ What I didn’t remember, until I read it again later, was that he was actually cut in half at that point by a German machine gun. The next thing I knew I was up and running on my own, shouting, &#x27;Zulu, Zulu, Zulu’, which was our company battle cry and also the battle cry of my father’s old regiment, [the] South Wales Borderers.&quot;

Second Lieutenant Aldo Eugenio Franco and his RI 6 platoon, after having scrapped a planned counterattack in conjunction with Major David Carullo&#x27;s Panhard armoured car squadron, because the Two Sisters defenders no longer held the peaks, covered the Argentine withdrawal and prevented Yankee Company from attacking C Company as it withdrew from Two Sisters. Augusto Esteban La Madrid, a second lieutenant in the local reserve tasked with assisting Major Cordon, told British historian Martin Middlebrook that, during the final clashes, &quot;&quot;Subteniente Franco&#x27;s platoon was left as a rearguard, but he made it back to Tumbledown OK&quot;.&quot; Private Oscar Ismael Poltronieri who held up Yankee Company with accurate shooting with his rifle and a machine-gun, was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Heroic Valour in Combat Cross (CHVC), the highest Argentine decoration for bravery. Sub-Lieutenant Nazer had been wounded covering the withdrawal and the remnants of his platoon having been placed under the command of Corporal Virgilio Rafael Barrientos, took up positions on Sapper Hill. Sub-Lieutenants Mosquera-Gutierrez and Pérez-Grandi had been wounded in the British bombardment, and the remnants of their platoons were put under the command of Captain Carlos López Patterson, the Operations Officer of the 4th Regiment, who took up blocking positions in the ground between Mount Tumbledown and Wireless Ridge alongside the dismounted 10th Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron under Captain Rodrigo Alejandro Soloaga, engaging at times with heavy machine gun and mortar fire the forward 3 PARA elements on Mount Longdon throughout the daylight hours of 12 and 13 June.

After capturing Two Sisters, 45 COMMANDO came under retaliatory fire from the surrounding Argentine positions. Captain Gardiner&#x27;s X-Ray Company reported another wounded Marine (Corporal Frank Melia) in the daylight hours of 12 June after attracting mortar rounds from Tumbledown Mountain.A number of marines in Gardiner&#x27;s company, sheltering in the abandoned bunkers on Two Sisters from the Argentine field artillery, were also incapacitated in the daylight hours of 12 and 13 June after losing their hearing in the near-misses from exploding 105mm and 155mm shells.

On 13 June, Argentine A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers got through the British Combat Air Patrols and attacked vehicles and helicopters stationed around 3 Commando Brigade Headquarters on the lower western slopes of Two Sisters (near Murrell River), resulting in a helicopter crewman injured and considerable structural damage to three Gazelle helicopters.

On the morning of 14 June, as 45 Commando on the forward slopes of Two Sisters prepared to reinforce the Welsh Guards consolidating on Sapper Hill, a Snowcat tracked vehicle from 407 Transportation Troop that arrived in support ran into a minefield and its driver got out to warn others behind of the danger ahead, only to step on an anti-personnel mine requiring urgent medical evacuation in a helicopter.

==Naval bombardment==
Naval gunfire support was provided by HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot;&#x27;s twin 4.5-inch (114 mm) guns. The naval gunfire officer accompanying the Royal Marines had been wounded early in the battle for Two Sisters, but Bombardier Edward Holt from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, took over and continued to give swift and accurate directions to the destroyer and was subsequently awarded the Military Medal.

On the night of the battle &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was asked to remain in action longer than planned, to help Yankee Company clear &quot;Subteniente&quot; Aldo Franco&#x27;s rifle platoon on the eastern half of Two Sisters covering the Argentine withdrawal. As the destroyer took a short cut closer to the shoreline a RASIT radar of the Argentinian Army tracked her movements.

Two MM38 Exocet missiles had been removed from the destroyer ARA &quot;Seguí&quot; and secured on launcher, dubbed &#x27;ITB&#x27; (&quot;Instalación de Tiro Berreta&quot;) &quot;trashy firing platform&quot;. The missiles, launcher, transporter, and associated electronics trailer were flown by transport aircraft to the Falkland Islands on 31 May. 

At 0336 local time, the British skipper, Commander Ian Inskip, looking at the radar screen, realized that Glamorgan was under attack by an anti-ship missile, and ordered a highspeed turn just before the Exocet struck the port side adjacent to the hangar. The missile skidded on the deck and detonated, making a hole in the hangar deck and a hole in the galley area below, where a fire started.

The blast travelled forwards and down, and the missile, penetrated the hangar door, causing the ship&#x27;s Wessex helicopter (HAS.3 XM837) to explode and start a severe fire in the hangar. Fourteen crew members were killed and about twenty wounded. 

== Aftermath ==
The next morning Colonel Andrew Whitehead looked in wonderment at the strength of the positions the enemy had abandoned. &quot;With fifty Royals,&quot; he said, &quot;I could have died of old age holding this place.&quot; (Max Hastings, &quot;Going To The Wars,&quot; p. 363, Macmillan 2000) Although the British unit seemed at the time to have had an easy victory, those actually engaged with the enemy platoons would have been unlikely to agree. Thirty years later, Marine Keith Brown recalled the fighting for the northern peak and concluded

British-American historian Hugh Bicheno has been critical of the 6th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s &#x27;B&#x27; Company who, he claims, withdrew in a disorderly manner from front-line positions at the opening of the battle, although this seems to have little foundation. Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre had certainly been planning to counterattack on Two Sisters but with the defenders no longer in possession of the twin peaks, he ordered the abandonment of the feature and later wrote &quot;All of a sudden, we suffer the first emotional impact. It was 04.45 when we received reports from Major Jaimet saying that the defenders on Two Sisters could no longer resist the enemy attack and would begin their withdrawal.&quot; Major Oscar Ramón Jaimet has gone on record, saying in the Argentinean newspaper &quot;La Gaceta&quot; that he had designated Sub-Lieutenant Franco to cover the Argentinean withdrawal and that Argentinean artillery fire was brought down in error amongst the company. Indeed, the company withdrew in good order, according to the Spanish-speaking warrant officer attached to 3 Commando Brigade Headquarters in the fighting. The Argentine Army Official Report on the war recommended Major Oscar Ramon Jaimet and CSM Jorge Edgardo Pitrella of the 6th Regiment&#x27;s B Company for an MVC (Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal) for the conduct of their fighting withdrawal and subsequent behaviour on Tumbledown (this was later granted to Major Jaimet, Pitrella was awarded the Argentine Army to the Effort and Abnegation Medal).

Sergeant-Major George Meachin of Yankee Company later praised the fighting abilities and spirit of the Argentine defenders of the northern peak in the form of the men of Pérez-Grandi and Mosquera-Gutierrez:

Hugh Bicheno described the moonscape of devastation:

With the telephone lines to the command post in shreds, Llambías Pravaz led his men to join M Company, 5th Marine Infantry Battalion on Sapper Hill. He had nearly been killed in the fighting when a rock impacted his helmet after a Milan missile exploded close behind him.

The X-Ray Company Marines were in awe of the Argentines in the depleted 3rd Platoon who had put up such determined resistance, and their company commander, Captain Gardiner in the book &quot;Above All, Courage&quot; (Above All, Courage: The Falklands Front Line: First-Hand Accounts, Max Arthur, pp. 389–390, Sidwick &amp; Jackson, 1985) later said:

A lone conscript rifleman on &#x27;Long Toenail&#x27; held out long after resistance had ended on the mountain. There was a humorous moment when the Revd. Wynne Jones was challenged by the Marines and called out that he was 45 Commando&#x27;s padre and had forgotten the password.

Some 30 years later, Marine Nick Hunt of X-Ray Company got in contact with Sub-Lieutenant Marcelo Llambías-Pravaz, and in a televised reunion on the southern peak of the mountain, he returned the pictures he had found of the army officer and his platoon of conscripts the morning after the Royal Marines had stormed the position. 

=== Casualties ===
Seven Royal Marine Commandos and a sapper from 59 Independent Commando Squadron, Royal Engineers were killed taking Two Sisters.Another 17 British marines in 45 Commando, including platoon commanders (Lieutenants Fox, Dunning and Davies) were wounded. 20 Argentines were killed in the first eleven days of June and the night of the battle, another 50 were wounded and 54 taken prisoner.

HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot;, which was providing Naval gunfire support (NGS) stayed in her position to support the Royal Marine Commandos who were pinned down. HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot; stayed past the time she was meant to leave and was hit by a land-based Exocet missile, fourteen crew were killed and more wounded as a result of this attack.

=== Awards received ===
For bravery shown in the attack on Two Sisters, men from 45 Commando were awarded one DSO, three Military Crosses, one Distinguished Conduct Medal and four Military Medals. A commando from 29 Commando received a Military Medal as did a man from the M&amp;AW Cadre.

<doc id="528974" wikidata="Q595213" url="?curid=528974" title="Moksha (river)">
<text>Moksha (, ) is a river in central Russia, a right tributary of the Oka. It flows through Penza Oblast, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Ryazan Oblast and the Republic of Mordovia, and joins the Oka near Pyatnitsky Yar, near the city of Kasimov.

It is in length, and has a drainage basin of .

In the 1950s, several hydroelectric power stations were built in the middle course of the river, but without navigable locks. In 1955, 2 km below the mouth of the river. Prices on the Moksha River built Rasypukhinsky hydro-power plant with a hydroelectric power station and a wooden shipping lock. Navigation on the river was carried out until the mid-1990s.

On the Moksha is the Trinity-Scans monastery, the Nativity-Theotokos Sanaksar Monastery and the Krasnoslobodsky Savior-Transfiguration Monastery.

== Origin of name and cultural significance ==

The name is connected to the ancient Indo-European population of the Pohje, speaking a language close to the Baltic. Hydronym is comparable with the Indo-European basis meksha, meaning &quot;spillage, leakage&quot;. It is suggested that in the language of Indo-European aborigines moksha meant &quot;stream, current, river&quot; and as a term entered into a series of hydronyms (Shirmksha, Mamoksha, etc.).

The name &quot;Moksha&quot; is mentioned by the monk-minorite Rubruk, the ambassador of the French King Louis IX to the Mongolian khan Sartak (1253). It is also the self-designation for the eponymous Finno-Ugric ethnic group of Mokshas that have settled between the river and its tributary Oka as a tribe before the Middle Ages.

==Sources==
In the monograph &quot;The Nature of the Penza Region&quot; it is pointed out that p. Moksha originates from above. Lookout Nechaevsky (now Mokshan district) of the Penza region. According to the latest information, Moksha begins in a ravine from the springs system near the village of Elizavetino. The source of Moksha is on a treeless place. Research conducted in 2009-2010. Showed that from the south with. Lookout among the elevated places stretches low (up to Elizavetino) about long. This site is called &quot;Dry Moksha&quot;. In the hollow with a sandy and clay bottom deep, a creeping stream of in width runs (the study was conducted in May 2010). The constant flow of water is observed below the confluence of the hollow from the holy spring, where a small extension of the channel also forms. A true watercourse flows towards Vision in a poorly developed channel. In some places, the banks collapse in the face of the knocking out of them groundwater flowing into the channel. The bottom of the lowland where the stream flows is swamped. Along the banks of the stream, shrubs of willows, thickets of broadleaf cattails, reeds of forest and some other moisture-loving plants grow in the water. Thus, the source of Moksha is a drying creek, now fueled by thawed and groundwater. It stretches to c. The look gradually turning into a constant stream.

<doc id="528976" wikidata="Q749637" url="?curid=528976" title="Corpus luteum">
<text>The corpus luteum (Latin for &quot;yellow body&quot;; : corpora lutea) is a temporary endocrine structure in female ovaries involved in the production of relatively high levels of progesterone, and moderate levels of estradiol, and inhibin A. It is the remains of the ovarian follicle that has released a mature ovum during a previous ovulation.

The corpus luteum is colored as a result of concentrating carotenoids (including lutein) from the diet and secretes a moderate amount of estrogen that inhibits further release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and thus secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A new corpus luteum develops with each menstrual cycle.

==Development and structure== 
The corpus luteum develops from an ovarian follicle during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or oestrous cycle, following the release of a secondary oocyte from the follicle during ovulation. The follicle first forms a corpus hemorrhagicum before it becomes a corpus luteum, but the term refers to the visible collection of blood, left after rupture of the follicle, that secretes progesterone. While the oocyte (later the zygote if fertilization occurs) traverses the fallopian tube into the uterus, the corpus luteum remains in the ovary.

The corpus luteum is typically very large relative to the size of the ovary; in humans, the size of the structure ranges from under 2 cm to 5 cm in diameter.

Its cells develop from the follicular cells surrounding the ovarian follicle. The follicular theca cells luteinize into small luteal cells (thecal-lutein cells) and follicular granulosa cells luteinize into large luteal cells (granulosal-lutein cells) forming the corpus luteum. Progesterone is synthesized from cholesterol by both the large and small luteal cells upon luteal maturation. Cholesterol-LDL complexes bind to receptors on the plasma membrane of luteal cells and are internalized. Cholesterol is released and stored within the cell as cholesterol ester. LDL is recycled for further cholesterol transport. Large luteal cells produce more progesterone due to uninhibited/basal levels of protein kinase A (PKA) activity within the cell. Small luteal cells have LH receptors that regulate PKA activity within the cell. PKA actively phosphorylates steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and translocator protein to transport cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The development of the corpus luteum is accompanied by an increase in the level of the steroidogenic enzyme P450scc that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone in the mitochondria. Pregnenolone is then converted to progesterone that is secreted out of the cell and into the blood stream. During the bovine estrous cycle, plasma levels of progesterone increase in parallel to the levels of P450scc and its electron donor adrenodoxin, indicating that progesterone secretion is a result of enhanced expression of P450scc in the corpus luteum.

The mitochondrial P450 system electron transport chain including adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin has been shown to leak electrons leading to the formation of superoxide radical. Apparently to cope with the radicals produced by this system and by enhanced mitochondrial metabolism, the levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase also increase in parallel with the enhanced steroidogenesis in the corpus luteum.


Like the previous theca cells, the theca lutein cells lack the aromatase enzyme that is necessary to produce estrogen, so they can only perform steroidogenesis until formation of androgens. The granulosa lutein cells do have aromatase, and use it to produce estrogens, using the androgens previously synthesized by the theca lutein cells, as the granulosa lutein cells in themselves do not have the 17α-hydroxylase or 17,20 lyase to produce androgens.
Once the corpus luteum regresses the remnant is known as corpus albicans.

==Function==
The corpus luteum is essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in females. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which is a steroid hormone responsible for the decidualization of the endometrium (its development) and maintenance, respectively. It also produces relaxin, a hormone responsible for softening of the pubic symphysis which helps in parturition.

===Unsuccessful fertilisation===
If the egg is not fertilised, the corpus luteum stops secreting progesterone and decays (after approximately 10 days in humans). It then degenerates into a corpus albicans, which is a mass of fibrous scar tissue.

With cessation of progesterone release, the uterine lining (functional, inner layer of the endometrium) is expelled through the vagina (in mammals that go through a menstrual cycle). Across an estrous cycle, the functional layer regenerates to provide nourishing tissue for potential fertilisation and implantation.

===Successful fertilisation===

If the egg is fertilised and implantation occurs, the syncytiotrophoblast (derived from trophoblast) cells of the blastocyst secrete the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, or a similar hormone in other species) by day 9 post-fertilisation.

Human chorionic gonadotropin signals the corpus luteum to continue progesterone secretion, thereby maintaining the thick lining (endometrium) of the uterus and providing an area rich in blood vessels in which the zygote(s) can develop. From this point on, the corpus luteum is called the &quot;corpus luteum graviditatis&quot;.

The introduction of prostaglandins at this point causes the degeneration of the corpus luteum and the abortion of the fetus. However, in placental animals such as humans, the placenta eventually takes over progesterone production and the corpus luteum degrades into a corpus albicans without embryo/fetus loss.

Luteal support refers to the administration of medication (generally progestins) for the purpose of increasing the success of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.

===Content of carotenoids===

The yellow color and name of the corpus luteum, like that of the macula lutea of the retina, is due to its concentration of certain carotenoids, especially lutein. In 1968, a report indicated that beta-carotene was synthesized in laboratory conditions in slices of corpus luteum from cows. However, attempts have been made to replicate these findings, but have not succeeded. The idea is not presently accepted by the scientific community. Rather, the corpus luteum concentrates carotenoids from the diet of the mammal.

==In animals==
Similar structures and functions of the corpus luteum exist in some reptiles. Dairy cattle also follow a similar cycle.

<doc id="528977" wikidata="Q443495" url="?curid=528977" title="Murray Walker">
<text>Graeme Murray Walker (10 October 1923 – 13 March 2021) was an English motorsport commentator and journalist. He provided television commentary of live Formula One coverage for the BBC between 1976 and 1996, and for ITV between 1997 and 2001.

During his 23-year run as full-time commentator, Walker became known for his animated enthusiasm, authoritative voice and comical blunders – dubbed &quot;Murrayisms&quot; by fans – during live races. His commentary voice has been likened to a &quot;screech and resembles a 500cc engine being revved up&quot;. He retired from full-time commentary after the 2001 United States Grand Prix, but returned to broadcasting part-time in 2005 and made occasional appearances on the BBC, Channel 4, Network 10 and Sky Sports F1.

==Early life==
Graeme Murray Walker was born at 214 Reddings Lane in Hall Green, Birmingham, England, on 10 October 1923. His family is of Scottish descent. His father Graham Walker was a despatch rider and works motorcyclist for the Norton Motorcycle Company who participated in the Isle of Man TT. His mother, Elsie Spratt, was the daughter of Harry Spratt, a businessman from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Walker was an only child. In 1925 Walker and his family moved to Wolverhampton when Graham became the Competition Manager for Sunbeam. The family later moved to Coventry in 1928, when Graham worked as the Sales and Competition Director for Rudge-Whitworth.

Walker&#x27;s education began with a governess at the family home, followed by spells at preparatory schools around the country. He attended Highgate School, gaining a Distinction in Divinity. While at Highgate he joined the School Corps, learning to play the bugle. Walker was at a trials event with his father in Austria when the outbreak of the Second World War occurred in September 1939. Upon returning to Britain, the Highgate School governors became concerned about the possible extent of bombing raids on London, and so Walker and his fellow pupils were evacuated to Westward Ho! in Devon, staying there until 1941. During this time, Walker rose to the rank of Company Sergeant Major of the School Corps.

Walker was later conscripted into the armed forces and applied to volunteer for tanks, but was required to wait until a training place became available. In the meantime, he worked with the Dunlop Rubber Company, which offered 12 scholarships annually and was based at Fort Dunlop in Erdington, Birmingham. Walker had been evacuated to Erdington and lived with the Bellamy family at 58 Holly Lane. On 1 October 1942 he travelled to Wool in Dorset, where he reported to the 30th Primary Training Wing at Bovington, the headquarters of the Royal Armoured Corps.

Walker later attended and graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Scots Greys on 16 April 1944. The salute at his commissioning parade was taken by American General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander for the upcoming Allied invasion of Normandy. Walker went on to command a Sherman tank and to participate in the Battle of the Reichswald with the 4th Armoured Brigade. He left the Army in 1946, having attained the rank of captain.

Following the war, Walker briefly followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by taking up motorcycle racing, competing against, among others, a young John Surtees. After limited success, he switched to competing in motorcycle trials, where he made a greater mark, including taking a gold at the International Six Days Trial and winning a first-class award at the Scottish Six Days Trial.

After briefly attending Roehampton Technical Institute to study shipping management, Walker worked in advertising for Dunlop and Aspro. He was then headhunted by McCann Erickson, where he worked on the firm&#x27;s account with Esso. Following this, he was employed as an accounts director by the Masius advertising agency, with clients including British Rail, Vauxhall and Mars, for whom the agency created the slogan &quot;A Mars a day helps you work rest and play&quot;; Walker repeatedly denied the attribution of the slogan to himself, saying that he was only an administrator on the project. He did not retire from this job until the age of 59, long after he had gained fame as a commentator.

Walker created the slogan &quot;Trill makes budgies bounce with health&quot; – an advertising slogan for bird seed in the 1960s – as well as the slogan &quot;Opal Fruits, made to make your mouth water.&quot; He is credited with the naming of the late 1960s Vauxhall Ventora, with the car&#x27;s original proposed name, Ventura, being rejected by General Motors.

==Career as a commentator==
Walker made his first public broadcast at Shelsley Walsh hillclimb in 1948. He was given a recorded audition for the BBC at the 1949 Easter Monday Goodwood race. Walker later commentated on races alongside the tennis commentator Max Robertson, with his first radio broadcasting coming at the 1949 British Grand Prix for the BBC. He and Robertson were positioned at Stowe corner for the event. His debut television broadcast came in the same year when he commentated on hill-climbing at the Knatts Valley motorcycle venue in Kent. His first regular broadcasting work was on radio coverage of the Isle of Man annual Tourist Trophy motorcycle race alongside his father. Walker and his father were the single father and son sports commentary pair within the BBC from 1949 to 1962. After the death of his father in 1962, he became the BBC&#x27;s chief motorcycling commentator.

He did occasional Formula 1 commentaries during the 1970s before going full-time for the 1978 season. Walker was asked by the head of BBC Sport Paul Fox to commentate on the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championships in Bristol, and he asked the weightlifter Oscar Slate to educate him on the sport. He covered the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1967, motocross (initially for ITV and BBC) during the 1960s and rallycross in the 1970s and early 1980s. He occasionally commentated on scrambling (now motocross) motorcycle racing and rallying during the 1960s through to the 1980s. Walker covered the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) for the BBC between 1969 and 1971 and also 1988 and 1997, and the Macau Grand Prix for Hong Kong TV on nine occasions. He joined the Channel 7 commentary team of the Bathurst 1000 Australian touring car race in 1997 and 1998. As the BBC began to broadcast additional forms of motor racing, he commented on Formula 3, Formula Ford and truck racing.

On Formula One coverage from the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix to the 1993 Canadian Grand Prix, Walker struck up a surprisingly successful, and extremely popular, double act with World Champion James Hunt. Initially, they did not get on, as Hunt&#x27;s interests, personality and private life appeared to have little in common with Walker&#x27;s. However, the pair eventually became good friends. Walker and Hunt were to work together for more than a decade at the BBC, until Hunt&#x27;s death from a heart attack two days after the 1993 Canadian Grand Prix, aged 45.

When in the commentary booth together, Walker would provide his animated descriptions of the action, with Hunt bringing in his expert knowledge, which included inside information from the pit lane, typically from his former team McLaren, and often opinionated nature, in his co-commentary role. The pair did not always get along in the commentary box. Typically, they had to share one microphone which meant passing it back and forth to each other. On one occasion early in their partnership, Walker would not hand the microphone over after repeated requests by Hunt for him to do so. In frustration, Hunt stood and grabbed the microphone from him, which caused the normally cool Walker to grab the former World Champion by the collar and raise his fist to hit his partner before a producer intervened.

After Hunt died, former F1 driver and BBC pit lane reporter Jonathan Palmer joined Walker in the commentary box until the end of 1996, though in individuals such as three-time world champion Jackie Stewart took the role as Walker&#x27;s partner for the 1993 British Grand Prix and World Champion Alan Jones commented alongside Walker in Australia at the end of the season following a request by &quot;Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;. The following year, the television rights of the UK television coverage transferred to ITV, and Walker followed. His co-commentator from the 1997 season until his retirement from commentating was another former F1 driver, Martin Brundle.

Jonathan Martin, the head of BBC Sport, retained Walker&#x27;s services for the corporation&#x27;s coverage of the BTCC after the latter&#x27;s rolling contract expired with them in May 1997. Walker opted not to renew his contract with the BBC in 1998 to focus on ITV&#x27;s broadcasting on Formula One and he did not want to frequently commute to London to record commentary of the BTCC. There were a few Grands Prix between 1978 and 1996 that Walker did not commentate on while employed by the BBC, usually as a result of his commentating elsewhere. Some of these included the 1979 Belgian Grand Prix and 1988 Hungarian Grand Prix (when Simon Taylor deputised for him), the German Grands Prix of 1981 and 1984 (both commentated on by Barrie Gill), and the 1985 German Grand Prix (Tony Jardine).

In 1988, Walker appeared in two television advertisements opposite actor Eric Idle, who played the part of a salesman attempting to persuade Walker and racing driver Nigel Mansell to purchase an Austin Metro. In 1996, as part of Pizza Hut&#x27;s global advertising strategy using celebrities, he and Formula One driver Damon Hill advertised the chain&#x27;s new stuffed-crust pizza. Walker also wrote a series of annuals for the Grand Prix season, &quot;Murray Walker&#x27;s Grand Prix Year&quot;. He presented a six-part radio series called &quot;Murray Walker&#x27;s Grand Prix World&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live from May to June 1997, detailing the history and development of Formula One. Walker had a column in the &quot;F1 Racing&quot; monthly magazine.

He broke his hip at the 2000 Goodwood Festival of Speed and was replaced for the French Grand Prix by pit lane reporter James Allen. At the 2000 German Grand Prix, Walker erroneously said that Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello had crashed when it actually was his teammate Michael Schumacher. This led to criticism about his frequent errors in an article published by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on the following day, and it prompted Walker to speak to his bosses at ITV Sport about his future. He told the broadcaster&#x27;s head of sport Brian Barwick that he would retire. Barwick told Walker he did not believe that retirement was ideal and suggested to Walker he commentate for another season to wind down his career. Walker announced to the press his retirement from Formula One commentary in December 2000. He would commentate on 12 Grands Prix by skipping Brazil, Europe, France, Germany and Japan before continuing to work for ITV in a reduced role entering . Bernie Ecclestone, the owner of Formula One&#x27;s commercial rights, had suggested to Walker that he commentate on his world feed television coverage, which was declined. His final full-time Formula One television commentary was the 2001 United States Grand Prix and he was awarded an original brick from &quot;The Brickyard&quot; by track president Tony George.

He was appointed an OBE in the 1996 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting and motor sports. In November 1997, Walker was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Bournemouth University. He was later honoured, in July 2005, with an honorary doctorate from the Middlesex University, London. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in November 1997. Walker was named the winner of the Gregor Grant Award from the motor racing magazine &quot;Autosport&quot; in 1993. In 2000, he won the Royal Television Society Lifetime Achievement Award, and was named the recipient of the BAFTA Special Award for Contribution to Television in 2002.

==Later years==
He was retained by ITV on a part-time role reviewing the 2002 season at various points. Walker&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Unless I&#x27;m Very Much Mistaken&quot;, was published in late 2002. He had eight publishers who wanted to put out the book, and he began to compose it in early 2001. Walker negotiated payment of the book sales with the publishers HarperCollins, and he ventured to various worldwide locations to promote it. He competed in Australia&#x27;s Targa Tasmania tarmac rally road race as navigator to driver Colin Bond in a Toyota Team Racing-entered Toyota Camry Sportivo in May 2003, finishing second in their class and 44th overall. Walker navigated former Grand Prix competitor Chris Amon in a Toyota Camry Sportivo at the Targa New Zealand that took place five months later, where they finished eighth in their class and 114th outright.

In October 2005, it was announced that he would be returning to the microphone as the BBC&#x27;s voice of the new Grand Prix Masters series. After providing the commentary for the inaugural race in South Africa, in January 2006 BBC Radio 5 Live announced that Walker would be part of their team for their coverage of subsequent races. He also conducted interviews and special features for the radio station throughout the 2006 Formula One World Championship.

Years of exposure to loud engines and age-related hearing problems had left Walker with hearing loss in both ears. In 2006 he became chief ambassador for David Ormerod Hearing Centres, a high-street audiology chain that fitted his hearing aids.

In March 2006, the Honda Racing F1 Team, formerly British American Racing, announced that Walker would become its team ambassador for half of the 2006 season&#x27;s 18 Grands Prix, starting with the San Marino Grand Prix in April. Walker welcomed Honda Racing&#x27;s VIP guests and entertained them with his F1 commentary. He was Sky Sports&#x27; commentator for their coverage of Grand Prix Masters, performed commentary duties of the Australian Grand Prix for the Australian television broadcaster Network Ten in 2006 and 2007, and voiced the Clipsal 500 V8 Supercars race in Adelaide.

In June 2007, Walker visited the Isle of Man to celebrate the Centenary of the Isle of Man TT, and work on a DVD documentary about the event, &quot;TT: Centenary Celebration with Murray Walker&quot;. In July 2007, Walker commentated on the European Grand Prix for BBC Radio 5 Live. This was a one-off in lieu of regular commentator David Croft who was on paternity leave. He commented on the qualifying session, the race and presented the phone-in programme &quot;606&quot; to answer listeners&#x27; questions.

He and writer Philip Porter authored a book called &quot;Murray Walker Scrapbook&quot; on his memories and photographic memorabilia concerning his career with contributions from members of the Formula One community, which was published on 2 May 2008. On 28 June 2008, Walker was honoured by the people of his hometown and presented with a &quot;Star&quot; on the Walk of Stars on Broad Street, Birmingham.

Walker became a freelance website columnist for the BBC&#x27;s recovered coverage of Formula One in 2009. He voiced the part of his own character in two episodes of the Five children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Roary the Racing Car&quot; in late 2009. Walker made a further appearance on the programme as a professional skateboarder the following year. In early 2011, he lent his voice as a racing commentator to the touring theatre production of &quot;Roary the Racing Car&quot; entitled &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; in an animated portion of the programme. A television documentary called &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; centred on Walker&#x27;s life and advertising and commentary career was broadcast on BBC Two on 5 June 2011.

In May 2013, while on holiday, he had a fall, breaking his pelvis. During treatment for the fall, Walker was diagnosed with the early stages of lymphatic system cancer. His condition was mild and treatable. In June 2013, it was reported that Walker was to receive chemotherapy in the coming months, and had cancelled plans to attend the 2013 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Walker did not need chemotherapy anymore by July 2013. He was the guest star on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 16 March 2014, where he selected Chris McNab&#x27;s &quot;How to Survive Anything, Anywhere: A Handbook of Survival Skills for Every Scenario and Environment&quot; as his choice of book, and a hammock and pillow as his luxury items.

In 2015 it was announced Walker would present a new Formula One programme for BBC Two with Suzi Perry. The show called &quot;Formula 1 Rewind&quot; involved Walker looking back at some of the BBC&#x27;s archives. In November 2015 he appeared on BBC&#x27;s game show &quot;Pointless&quot;, paired with Nigel Mansell.

In 2016 Walker moved with many other BBC F1 staff to Channel 4 to present a series of interviews with the sport&#x27;s key players. Walker also provided continuity announcements to Formula One programming and races. Walker withdrew from Channel 4&#x27;s commentary for the 2018 British Grand Prix due to ill health but appeared in recorded features.

==Commentary style==
Walker chose to stand while commentating during races rather than sitting down, allowing him to speak louder due to his lungs being inflated and his shoulders pushed back. He was uncritical of drivers who had made errors, preferring to let that judgement pass to his co-commentators. Walker was articulate in his speech, and he was a good reader of mood after an on-track incident. He sometimes made humorous verbal errors known as &quot;Murrayisms&quot; that ranged from &quot;simple misidentifications&quot; to &quot;lovely, labyrinthian, effortlessly complex acrobatic displays of linguistic virtuosity.&quot; According to Stephen Moss of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, they were &quot;the hallmark of his commentary over the years&quot; and noted that they made him &quot;the fan who happened to have been given the keys to the commentary box: he couldn&#x27;t control his enthusiasm and that seemed naturally to lead to catastrophe.&quot; Moss likened Walker&#x27;s commentary voice to a &quot;screech and resembles a 500cc engine being revved up&quot; because he required &quot;a harsh, aggressive, noisy, fast-moving voice&quot; to comment on a constantly changing landscape.

He prepared himself for every piece of commentary work by meticulously researching facts and statistics on every driver and race track, updating and rewriting them for the following event. George Tamayo described Walker as having an &quot;encyclopedic&quot; knowledge of Grand Prix racing, and one who held enough authority amongst the press that members of the Formula One community would rarely decline to be interviewed by him. Before the introduction of reliable satellite broadcast equipment, he was obliged by his superiors at the BBC to prepare for television broadcasts by venturing to a circuit two days before a race to prepare for a broadcast in London, where he would watch the day&#x27;s events on a satellite feed and then commentate on it during the evening highlights programme. Walker was voted &quot;the greatest sports commentator of all time&quot; in a poll conducted by British sports fans in late 2009.

==Personal life==
Despite his love of cars, Walker never took a driving test. He was given a tank driving licence in the British Army and that was considered valid to qualify for a civilian driving licence. He married his wife Elizabeth in 1955; the couple had no children.

In December 1992, Walker had surgery but twisted his hip the day after surgery.

In June 2013, aged 89, Walker was diagnosed with lymphoma and received chemotherapy. Walker died on 13 March 2021, aged 97. He was memorialised by the Williams team at the 2021 Bahrain Grand Prix, where a sticker on the car&#x27;s halo featured a quote from Walker&#x27;s commentary, &quot;And I&#x27;ve got to stop, because I&#x27;ve got a lump in my throat&quot;, on the 1996 Japanese Grand Prix, when Damon Hill secured the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Walker did not have a funeral or memorial service as per the instructions he made in his will.

==Legacy==
The Murray Walker Award was established by Motorsport UK in 2023 and is awarded in recognition of &quot;outstanding excellence in broadcast journalism.&quot;

<doc id="528978" wikidata="Q1174912" url="?curid=528978" title="Cadwallon">
<text>Cadwallon is a Welsh name derived from the Common Brittonic &quot;*Katuwellaunos&quot; (Proto-Celtic *&quot;Katu-welnā-mnos&quot;) &quot;The One Who (-mnos) Leads (welnā-) in Battle (katu-)&quot;. The same name belonged to the Catuvellauni who lived in what is now Hertfordshire, one of the most powerful British polities in the Late Iron Age who led the resistance against the Romans in 43 CE and possibly against Caesar in 55 and 54 BCE as well.

&quot;Cadwallon&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;Caswallon&quot;, which derives from &quot;*Kađđi-welnā-mnos&quot; (the same name as Cassivellaunus), meaning &quot;The Passionate Leader&quot;. Note that in Cornish, both &quot;Katuwellaunos&quot;(/Catuvellaunus) and &quot;Kađđiwellaunos&quot;(/Cassivellaunus) give the form Kaswallon, which adds to the confusion.

Cadwallon may refer to:
* Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion (reigned early 6th century), King of Gwynedd
* Cadwallon ap Cadfan (reigned early 7th century), King of Gwynedd
* Cadwallon ab Owain (died ), prince of Deheubarth
* Cadwallon ab Ieuaf (died 986), King of Gwynedd
* Cadwallon ap Gruffydd (12th century), son of Gruffudd ap Cynan
* Cadwallon ap Madog (12th century), ruler of Maelienydd
* &quot;Cadwallon&quot; (role-playing game), a 2006 game published by Rackham
* Cædwalla (c. 659 – 689), King of Wessex (&quot;Cædwalla&quot; is the Old English spelling of &quot;Cadwalla&quot; (&lt; Brythonic &quot;*Katuwallios&quot;), an alternative form of the same name.)

<text>Alan Rubin (February 11, 1943 – June 8, 2011), also known as Mr. Fabulous, was an American musician. He played trumpet, flugelhorn, and piccolo trumpet.

== Early life and education ==
Rubin was born in Brooklyn. He began attending Juilliard School of Music in New York when he was 17 and studied with William Vacchiano, who was principal trumpet in the New York Philharmonic. Vacchiano described Rubin as his best student. While at Juilliard, Rubin was invited to play with Paul Hindemith on his last concert tour of the United States, but Rubin chose instead to play with Peggy Lee at the Village Vanguard. Rubin dropped out of Juilliard at 20 to tour with singer Robert Goulet as his lead trumpet player.

== Career ==
Rubin was a member of the Saturday Night Live Band, with whom he played at the Closing Ceremony of the 1996 Olympic Games. As a member of The Blues Brothers, he portrayed Mr. Fabulous in the 1980 film, the 1998 sequel and was a member of the touring band. In the first film, Rubin&#x27;s character is maitre d&#x27; at an expensive restaurant before Jake and Elwood persuade him to rejoin the band. The nickname &quot;Mr Fabulous&quot; was given to Rubin by John Belushi.

Rubin played with an array of artists, such as Frank Sinatra, Frank Zappa, Duke Ellington, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Gil Evans, Eumir Deodato, Sting, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Frankie Valli, Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Miles Davis, Yoko Ono, Peggy Lee, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and Dr. John. Rubin contributed to over 6000 recording sessions.

Rubin&#x27;s last performance was with The Blues Brotherhood (Blues Brothers tribute show) at B.B. King&#x27;s in New York City on October 12, 2010. The performance also featured Tom &quot;Bones&quot; Malone and Lou &quot;Blue Lou&quot; Marini.

== Death ==
Rubin died from lung cancer on June 8, 2011, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.

<text>Frisland, also called Frischlant, Friesland, Frislanda, Frislandia, or Fixland, is a phantom island that appeared on virtually all of the maps of the North Atlantic from the 1560s through the 1660s. It was removed as no Frisland was found as the area was more thoroughly explored and navigation increased. Accurate navigation was more difficult in this time (before more accurate Marine chronometers), and it might have originated from a misidentification of Iceland or Greenland.

== History ==
Frisland originally may also have been a cartographic approximation of Iceland, but in 1558 the influential Zeno map charted the landmass as an entirely separate island south (or occasionally south-west) of Iceland. 

After this incorrect charting, the phantom island appeared that way on maps for the next 100 years. Its existence was given currency in manuscript maps of the 1560s by the Maggiolo family of Genoa, and the island was accepted and reproduced by cartographers Gerardus Mercator and Jodocus Hondius. Some early maps by Willem Blaeu, such as his 1617 map of Europe, omit it, but it reappeared on his 1630 world map as one of many islands shown off the eastern coast of Labrador, which was then believed to extend to within a few hundred miles of Scotland. It also appeared on a 1652 world map by Visscher, largely copied from that of Blaeu. The 1693 Vincenzo Coronelli map places it close to Greenland. Frederick J. Pohl identified Frisland with an island he referred to as &quot;Fer Island&quot;, modern English Fair Isle, an island lying between mainland Shetland and the Orkney islands in his book arguing the case that Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney visited North America. Even in the mid-18th century, explorers&#x27; maps clearly depicted Frisland as separated from Greenland by a wide strait. 

The myth of Frisland was gradually dispensed with as explorers, chiefly from England and France, charted and mapped the waters of the North Atlantic. 

=== Depiction ===
Frisland was shown as a roughly rectangular island, with three triangular promontories on its western coast. 

In some mappings, it is identified as &quot;Fixland&quot;. (Matteo Prunes map of 1553, from Library of Congress, see upper right of map; see also, page 88 for other clearer source; see also Catalan map of 1480 showing &quot;Fixland&quot;; original source map copied in this article, page 64.)

<text>Renal physiology (Latin &quot;renes&quot;, &quot;kidneys&quot;) is the study of the physiology of the kidney. This encompasses all functions of the kidney, including maintenance of acid-base balance; regulation of fluid balance; regulation of sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes; clearance of toxins; absorption of glucose, amino acids, and other small molecules; regulation of blood pressure; production of various hormones, such as erythropoietin; and activation of vitamin D.

Much of renal physiology is studied at the level of the nephron, the smallest functional unit of the kidney. Each nephron begins with a filtration component that filters the blood entering the kidney. This filtrate then flows along the length of the nephron, which is a tubular structure lined by a single layer of specialized cells and surrounded by capillaries. The major functions of these lining cells are the reabsorption of water and small molecules from the filtrate into the blood, and the secretion of wastes from the blood into the urine.

Proper function of the kidney requires that it receives and adequately filters blood. This is performed at the microscopic level by many hundreds of thousands of filtration units called renal corpuscles, each of which is composed of a glomerulus and a Bowman&#x27;s capsule. A global assessment of renal function is often ascertained by estimating the rate of filtration, called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

==Formation of urine==

The kidney&#x27;s ability to perform many of its functions depends on the three fundamental functions of &quot;filtration&quot;, &quot;reabsorption&quot;, and &quot;secretion&quot;, whose sum is called renal clearance or renal excretion. That is:

:Urinary excretion rate = Filtration rate – Reabsorption rate + Secretion rate

Although the strictest sense of the word &quot;excretion&quot; with respect to the urinary system is urination itself, renal clearance is also conventionally called excretion (for example, in the set term &quot;fractional excretion of sodium&quot;).

===Filtration===

The blood is filtered by nephrons, the functional units of the kidney. Each nephron begins in a renal corpuscle, which is composed of a glomerulus enclosed in a Bowman&#x27;s capsule. Cells, proteins, and other large molecules are filtered out of the glomerulus by a process of ultrafiltration, leaving an ultrafiltrate that resembles plasma (except that the ultrafiltrate has negligible plasma proteins) to enter Bowman&#x27;s space. Filtration is driven by Starling forces.
The ultrafiltrate is passed through, in turn, the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and a series of collecting ducts to form urine.

===Reabsorption===

Tubular reabsorption is the process by which solutes and water are removed from the tubular fluid and transported into the blood. It is called &quot;reabsorption&quot; (and not &quot;absorption&quot;) both because these substances have already been absorbed once (particularly in the intestines) and because the body is reclaiming them from a postglomerular fluid stream that is well on its way to becoming urine (that is, they will soon be lost to the urine unless they are reclaimed).

Reabsorption is a two-step process beginning with the active or passive extraction of substances from the tubule fluid into the renal interstitium (the connective tissue that surrounds the nephrons), and then the transport of these substances from the interstitium into the bloodstream. These transport processes are driven by Starling forces, diffusion, and active transport.

====Indirect reabsorption====
In some cases, reabsorption is indirect. For example, bicarbonate (HCO3−) does not have a transporter, so its reabsorption involves a series of reactions in the tubule lumen and tubular epithelium. It begins with the active secretion of a hydrogen ion (H+) into the tubule fluid via a Na/H exchanger:

* In the lumen
** The H+ combines with HCO3− to form carbonic acid (H2CO3)
** Luminal carbonic anhydrase enzymatically converts H2CO3 into H2O and CO2
** CO2 freely diffuses into the cell
* In the epithelial cell
** Cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase converts the CO2 and H2O (which is abundant in the cell) into H2CO3
** H2CO3 readily dissociates into H+ and HCO3−
** HCO3− is facilitated out of the cell&#x27;s basolateral membrane

====Influence of hormones====
Some key regulatory hormones for re-absorption include:
* aldosterone, which stimulates active sodium re-absorption (and water as a result)
* anti-diuretic hormone, which stimulates passive water re-absorption

Both hormones exert their effects principally on the collecting ducts.

Tubular secretion occurs simultaneously during re-absorption of filtrate. Substances, generally produced by body or the by-products of cell metabolism that can become toxic in high concentration, and some drugs (if taken). These all are secreted into the lumen of renal tubule. Tubular secretion can be either active or passive or co-transport.
Substances mainly secreted into renal tubule are; H+, K+, NH3, urea, Creatinine, histamine and drugs like penicillin. 
Tubular secretion occurs at Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) and Distal Convoluted Tubule (D.C.T); for example, at proximal convoluted tubule, potassium is secreted by means of sodium-potassium pump, hydrogen ion is secreted by means of active transport and co-transport, i.e. anti-porter, and ammonia diffuses into renal tubule.

==Other functions==
=== Hormone secretion ===
The kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol, and renin. Erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate. Renin is an enzyme which regulates angiotensin and aldosterone levels.

===Maintaining homeostasis===
The kidney is responsible for maintaining a balance of the following substances:

The body is very sensitive to its pH. Outside the range of pH that is compatible with life, proteins are denatured and digested, enzymes lose their ability to function, and the body is unable to sustain itself. The kidneys maintain acid-base homeostasis by regulating the pH of the blood plasma. Gains and losses of acid and base must be balanced. Acids are divided into &quot;volatile acids&quot; and &quot;nonvolatile acids&quot;. See also titratable acid.

The major homeostatic control point for maintaining this stable balance is renal excretion. The kidney is directed to excrete or retain sodium via the action of aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or vasopressin), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and other hormones. Abnormal ranges of the fractional excretion of sodium can imply acute tubular necrosis or glomerular dysfunction.

====Acid-base====

Two organ systems, the kidneys and lungs, maintain acid-base homeostasis, which is the maintenance of pH around a relatively stable value. The lungs contribute to acid-base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acid-base balance: to reabsorb and regenerate bicarbonate from urine, and to excrete hydrogen ions and fixed acids (anions of acids) into urine.

====Osmolality====
The kidneys help maintain the water and salt level of the body. Any significant rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.

ADH binds to principal cells in the collecting duct that translocate aquaporins to the membrane, allowing water to leave the normally impermeable membrane and be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa recta, thus increasing the plasma volume of the body.

There are two systems that create a hyperosmotic medulla and thus increase the body plasma volume: Urea recycling and the &#x27;single effect.&#x27;

Urea is usually excreted as a waste product from the kidneys. However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released the aquaporins that are opened are also permeable to urea. This allows urea to leave the collecting duct into the medulla, creating a hyperosmotic solution that &quot;attracts&quot; water. Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be excreted or recycled again depending on whether ADH is still present or not.

The &#x27;single effect&#x27; describes the fact that the ascending thick limb of the loop of Henle is not permeable to water but is permeable to sodium chloride. This allows for a countercurrent exchange system whereby the medulla becomes increasingly concentrated, but at the same time setting up an osmotic gradient for water to follow should the aquaporins of the collecting duct be opened by ADH.

===Blood pressure===

Although the kidney cannot directly sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly depends upon the kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. Renin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin–angiotensin system. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney&#x27;s absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.

===Glucose formation===
The kidney in humans is capable of producing glucose from lactate, glycerol and glutamine. The kidney is responsible for about half of the total gluconeogenesis in fasting humans. The regulation of glucose production in the kidney is achieved by action of insulin, catecholamines and other hormones. Renal gluconeogenesis takes place in the renal cortex. The renal medulla is incapable of producing glucose due to absence of necessary enzymes.

==Measurement of renal function==
A simple means of estimating renal function is to measure pH, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and basic electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate). As the kidney is the most important organ in controlling these values, any derangement in these values could suggest renal impairment.

There are several more formal tests and ratios involved in estimating renal function:

<doc id="529019" wikidata="Q3518755" url="?curid=529019" title="Hydrogen ion">
<text>A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses an electron. A positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle-free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×1010 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. 
Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions.

==Cation (positively charged)==

A hydrogen atom is made up of a nucleus with charge +1, and a single electron. Therefore, the only positively charged ion possible has charge +1. It is noted H+.

Depending on the isotope in question, the hydrogen cation has different names:

* Hydron: general name referring to the positive ion of any hydrogen isotope (H+)
* Proton: 1H+ (i.e. the cation of protium)
* Deuteron: 2H+, D+
* Triton: 3H+, T+
In addition, the ions produced by the reaction of these cations with water as well as their hydrates are called hydrogen ions:

* Hydronium ion: H3O+
* Zundel cation: H5O2+ (named for Georg Zundel)
* Eigen cation: H9O4+ (or HO •3HO) (named for Manfred Eigen)

Zundel cations and Eigen cations play an important role in proton diffusion according to the Grotthuss mechanism.

In connection with acids, &quot;hydrogen ions&quot; typically refers to hydrons.

In the image at left the hydrogen atom (center) contains a single proton and a single electron. Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas addition of an electron gives an anion (right). The hydrogen anion, with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the cation. Hydrogen forms the only cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) still retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.
==Anion (negatively charged)==
Hydrogen anions are formed when additional electrons are acquired:

* Hydride: general name referring to the negative ion of any hydrogen isotope (H−)
* Protide: 1H−
* Deuteride: 2H−, D −
* Tritide: 3H−, T −

==Uses==
Hydrogen ions drive ATP synthase in photosynthesis. This happens when hydrogen ions get pushed across the membrane creating a high concentration inside the thylakoid membrane and a low concentration in the cytoplasm. However, because of osmosis, the H+ will force itself out of the membrane through ATP synthase. Using their kinetic energy to escape, the protons will spin the ATP synthase which in turn will create ATP. This happens in cellular respiration as well though the concentrated membrane will instead be the inner membrane of the mitochondria.

Hydrogen ions concentration, measured as pH, is also responsible for the acidic or basic nature of a compound. Water molecules split to form H+ and hydroxide anions. This process is referred to as the self-ionization of water.

==Ocean acidification==
The concentration of hydrogen ions and pH are inversely proportional; in an aqueous solution, an increased concentration of hydrogen ions yields a low pH, and subsequently, an acidic product. By definition, an acid is an ion or molecule that can donate a proton, and when introduced to a solution it will react with water molecules (H2O) to form a hydronium ion (H3O+), a conjugate acid of water. For simplistic reasoning, the hydrogen ion (H+) is often used to abbreviate the hydronium ion.

Ocean acidification is the direct consequence of elevated concentrations of hydrogen ions and carbonate saturation from significant absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) by the world&#x27;s oceans. The pre-industrial state of the ocean&#x27;s carbonate chemistry has been notably stable, including the balance of its pH. Following the industrial revolution, anthropogenic emissions of burning fossil fuels, cement production, and changes in land use, have increased the oceans uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 30%. In the ocean, the absorption capacity of this greenhouse gas is 59 times higher than in the atmosphere; the ocean acts as the largest carbon sink on the planet, playing a significant role in climate regulation. In addition to carbon fluxes, the natural process of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere into the deep ocean is facilitated by two systems, the biological pump and the solubility pump. The solubility pump is a physico-chemical process that transfers CO2 at the air-sea interface. Based on Henry&#x27;s Law, the amount of dissolved CO2 in an aqueous solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere. To maintain equilibrium, a state of high atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 leads to an increased oceanic exchange of this gas by molecular diffusion. 
In the surface waters, dissolved atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) reacts with water molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), a weak diprotic acid. Diprotic acids consist of two ionizable hydrogen atoms in each molecule. In an aqueous solution, partial dissociation of carbonic acid releases a hydrogen proton (H+) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3−), and subsequently, the bicarbonate ion dissociates into an additional hydrogen proton and a carbonate ion (CO32-). The dissolving and dissociating of these inorganic carbon species generate an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions and inversely lowers ambient surface ocean pH. The carbonate buffering system governs the acidity of seawater by maintaining dissolved inorganic carbon species in chemical equilibrium.

The chemical equation consists of reactants and products that may react in either direction. More reactants added to a system yield more product production (the chemical reaction shifts to the right) and if more product is added, additional reactants will form, shifting the chemical reaction to the left. Therefore, in this model, a high concentration of the beginning reactant, carbon dioxide, produces an increased amount of end-product (H+ and CO32-), thus lowering pH and creating a more acidic solution. The natural buffering system of the ocean resist the change in pH by producing more bicarbonate ions generated by free acid protons reacting with carbonate ions to form an alkaline character. However, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations may exceed the buffering capacity threshold, consequently resulting in higher rates of ocean acidification. Shifts in the ocean&#x27;s carbonate chemistry has the potential to manipulate ocean biogeochemical cycles for many elements and compounds causing profound impacts on marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the solubility of CO2 is temperature dependent; elevated surface water temperatures reduce CO2 solubility. A continual rise in atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 could potentially convert the ocean from acting as sink (the vertical transport of carbon to the depths of the ocean) to becoming a source (CO2 degassing from the ocean), further increasing global temperatures.

<doc id="529025" wikidata="Q1066453" url="?curid=529025" title="Seto Kaiba">
<text>is a fictional character in the manga &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; by Kazuki Takahashi. As the majority shareholder and CEO of his own multi-national gaming company, Kaiba Corporation, Kaiba is reputed to be Japan&#x27;s greatest gamer and aims to become the world&#x27;s greatest player of the American card game, Duel Monsters (Magic &amp; Wizards in the Japanese manga). In all mediums, his arch-rival is the protagonist of the series, Yugi Mutou, who is also a game player while Zigfried Von Schroeder is also his arch-rival. He is the modern day counterpart of Atem&#x27;s cousin son of Aknadin nephew of Aknamkanon and one of the Pharaoh Atem&#x27;s Six High Priests, &quot;Priest Seto&quot;, who appears in the manga&#x27;s final arc. Kaiba has also appeared in related anime and feature films. His signature monster is the Blue-Eyes White Dragon.

Seto Kaiba originates from one of the stories Takahashi heard from a friend involving a selfish card collector. Like the card collector, Kaiba is obsessed with gaming, but Takahashi also gave Kaiba a calmer demeanor when developing his relationship with his rival. He was first voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa in Japanese, with Kenjirō Tsuda replacing him in the sequel &quot;Duel Monsters&quot;. Eric Stuart voiced him in all of his English appearances.

Critical reception to Kaiba has been mixed; he has been compared to simplistic anime rivals based on his multiple attempts to defeat Yugi and become the superior Duel Monsters player. While his development in the film &quot;Dark Side of Dimensions&quot; was praised for being a major focus in the narrative, critics still felt Kaiba&#x27;s obsession with Duel Monsters and focus on his original goal made him come across as a one-dimensional character. Nevertheless, the character has become popular amongst fans of the series, who felt that his motives made him more enjoyable despite lacking substance.

==Creation and development==

Seto Kaiba originates from stories Kazuki Takahashi&#x27;s friend told him. According to one of these stories, there was a person who played trading cards and asked another person to play with them; however, this person was unwilling to play with him because he was not an expert. Displeased upon hearing about this person, Takahashi decided to use them as inspiration for a manga character, resulting in Kaiba&#x27;s creation.

In the making of the series, Takahashi wanted to create an appealing creature for his Duel Monster fight with Yugi Mutou. This creature was named the &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot;, as he wanted it &quot;to evoke a feeling that would allow readers to conjure up its colors&quot;. This later led to the creation of Kisara for the series&#x27; final arc and the reveal of her origins being connected with Kaiba.

According to Takahashi, while Yugi and Kaiba are rivals, they are not close friends. He believes, however, the most important part of their relationship is before Yugi&#x27;s duel against Marik&#x27;s alter-ego. Before the game begins, Kaiba passes Yugi a card that could help him in the game. This scene felt like one of the most difficult scenes to write because of the pair&#x27;s rivalry.

The dub refers to him as Priest Seto&#x27;s reincarnation. In the manga and Japanese sub, Kaiba is instead the counterpart to Priest Seto— not the reincarnation, because Priest Seto is seen in the afterlife. Just as Yugi is not a reincarnation of Atem, but instead is a modern day counterpart. Instead destiny repeats and guides them into certain roles that are similar. Seto Kaiba is seen rejecting destiny, due to the desire to control his own destiny and future. According to Takahashi, the feelings of for Kisara are the basis behind Kaiba&#x27;s modern-day obsession with the Blue Eyes White Dragon.

Takahashi views Kaiba as Yugi&#x27;s archnemesis and thus considers Yugi a highly important character because, without him, Kaiba would not have a reason to exist.

In the second Japanese anime adaptation of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh&quot; series, Kaiba is voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda. Tsuda expressed a dislike towards his character, as he would not befriend him; according to him &quot;I definitely don&#x27;t want to become friends with him. I don&#x27;t think anyone really does&quot;. He also added that if he ever met Kaiba, he would say &quot;Glad to see you&#x27;re doing well&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m always in your care.&quot; Nevertheless, he regarded Kaiba as both a &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; character on his own.

English voice actor Eric Stuart felt he was connected to Kaiba. He noted that most fans tend to view him as a villain, but he instead views him as a rival, stating that Kaiba&#x27;s role is to strengthen Yugi&#x27;s skills. However, he noted that for the film &quot;Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, Kaiba has changed since his introduction due to his obsession with power, and so he wanted to give him an edge in his personality. Nevertheless, he views Kaiba&#x27;s characterization as consistent.

==Appearances==
===In the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga===
In his introduction, Kaiba discovers that the grandfather of his classmate, Yugi Mutou, owns the rare Blue-Eyes White Dragon card, and takes it from him. Dark Yugi emerges from within Yugi&#x27;s Millennium Puzzle to challenge Kaiba to a Shadow Game to reclaim it. Kaiba is ultimately defeated, suffering Dark Yugi&#x27;s Penalty Game: . Afterward, he plots to take revenge against Yugi and acquires the other three Blue-Eyes White Dragon cards through extortion and blackmail and builds &quot;Death T,&quot; a &quot;theme park&quot; made up of deadly games designed to kill Yugi and his friends. He defeats Sugoroku and tears up his Blue-Eyes White Dragon; he also subjects him to an artificial Penalty Game, forcing Yugi to participate in Death-T or else he will kill him. Yugi once again defeats him and uses the power of his Millennium Puzzle to subject Kaiba to a Penalty Game, leaving him in a coma.

Later on, Duel Monsters creator and Millennium Eye wielder Maximillion Pegasus schemes to take control of from Seto by conspiring with its board of directors, the Big Five, and abducting his brother Mokuba. After Kaiba awakens from his coma, he learns of Pegasus&#x27; plans and his kidnapping of Mokuba and travels to Duelist Kingdom, where he regains his deck and briefly battles Jonouchi. Kaiba and Yugi later play the game atop the castle parapets, and Kaiba is nearly defeated until he endangers his life by balancing on the edge of the turret. Dark Yugi nearly kills Kaiba, but Yugi forces him to forfeit the game so Kaiba is not killed. Kaiba goes on to duel Pegasus, but is overcome by the power of his Millennium Eye and is defeated. Pegasus gives Kaiba the &quot;Mind Card&quot; Penalty Game, sealing his soul into a card; when Dark Yugi defeats Pegasus in a Shadow Game during the final round of the tournament, both Kaiba and his brother are freed from their Penalty Games.

In the Battle City arc, Kaiba is summoned to the Domino City museum by Egyptologist Ishizu Ishtar, where he is shown an ancient stone tablet that depicts a battle between what appears to be his past self and the Pharaoh. He is interested in her tale of the God Cards – three powerful one-of-a-kind cards that Pegasus had entrusted to her. However, two of them were stolen by her brother Marik and his Ghouls organization, and she gives the third – &quot;God of Obelisk&quot; – to Kaiba, encouraging him to hold a tournament to lure in Marik and his organization. Seeking to obtain the remaining two God Cards for himself and eliminate Marik and his organization, Kaiba agrees and begins his &quot;Battle City&quot; competition. During the tournament, Kaiba teams up with Dark Yugi to rescue Mokuba and Yugi&#x27;s friends from Marik&#x27;s clutches. Afterward, Yugi, Kaiba and Jonouchi enter the finals, unaware that Marik has made a deal with Dark Bakura, and he, along with Marik and Marik&#x27;s stepbrother Rishid, are registered as well. Kaiba trumps Ishizu&#x27;s prophecy of defeat and claims victory. Kaiba faces Yugi in the semifinals, and the two unleash their God Cards against the other. Yugi manages to defeat Kaiba and go on to the final battle against Dark Marik. Kaiba gives Yugi the card &quot;Fiend Sanctuary&quot; prior to the duel, and with it, Yugi is able to hold off the attacks of Dark Marik&#x27;s &quot;Sun Dragon Ra&quot; and defeat him in his Shadow Game.

===In the anime ===
Shortly after his return from the Duelist Kingdom, the Big Five attempt to appease an outraged Kaiba by revealing they have finalized his virtual reality game software, and invite him to test it out for himself. However, this is actually an attempt to eliminate Kaiba, but Yugi and his friends manage to rescue him. The Big Five log into the virtual world in an attempt to stop them from escaping, but they are defeated in a duel and their minds become trapped in the virtual reality program. Some time later, in the midst of the Battle City tournament, the Big Five&#x27;s digital consciousnesses are discovered stranded in cyberspace by a mysterious boy named Noah, who recruits them for a revenge campaign against Kaiba. Noah admits to being Gozaburo Kaiba&#x27;s biological son, and claims his mind exists as a computer program after he was fatally wounded as a child and later digitized. After Noah is defeated, Gozaburo reveals himself to be alive inside the Virtual World and sets a series of orbital missiles to launch and destroy the world. While Kaiba stops Gozaburo, a reformed Noah reprograms one of the satellites to attack the main computer database and helps Yugi and his friends escape.

In Season 4 of the anime, Kaiba, along with Jonouchi and Yugi, is one of three duelists chosen to fight the brainwashed Atlantean King Dartz. During the season, Kaiba meets Amelda, an orphan whose brother and parents were killed by KaibaCorp-owned military forces under Gozaburo&#x27;s command although Gozaburo is actually Dartz in disguise. Due to his love for his brother, Kaiba becomes sympathetic to Amelda and carries his soul-less body to safety after their duel. Kaiba and Dark Yugi eventually duel Dartz, and although Kaiba loses, Dark Yugi defeats Dartz and Kaiba is restored, taking part in the battle against the Great Leviathan.

In the first half of season 5, KaibaCorp&#x27;s stock prices are at an all-time low as a result of a failed takeover by Dartz, and when Kaiba hosts a tournament to restore the company&#x27;s reputation, Zigfried von Schroeder (Kaiba&#x27;s arch rival and enemy) infiltrates it and hacks Kaiba&#x27;s computer systems. Upon catching Zigfried, Kaiba dispatches him in a duel. However, Zigfried has his brother Leon duel Yugi in the finals. During the duel, Zigfried tricks Leon into activating &quot;Golden Castle of Stromberg&quot;, releasing a computer virus into Kaiba&#x27;s system and forcing Leon to attack, thus forcing his hand. However, Yugi prevails while Kaiba, who anticipated such a plan, had his computer systems backed up.

Kaiba&#x27;s only appearance in the original manga version of the Millennium World arc is in the last chapter. Although he does not take part in the Shadow RPG during the Millennium World arc of the manga, in the anime, Yami Bakura gives him the Millennium Eye, which begins to show him visions and convinces him to fly to Egypt to determine if they are real or not. During the final battle, he is able to hold his ground against Zorc. In the original Japanese anime, Kaiba eventually acknowledges his past and the events that occurred within the Memory World Shadow RPG.

===&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; (1999 film)===
Kaiba is the main antagonist of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; movie, which was produced by Toei Animation in 1999. In this film, he learns about Shougo Aoyama&#x27;s Red-Eyes Black Dragon and organizes a tournament where strong duelists are invited and attendance is mandatory. Shougo and Yugi are later pursued by Kaiba&#x27;s henchmen from KaibaCorp, with Kaiba&#x27;s henchmen overpowering them and stealing Yugi&#x27;s Millennium Puzzle. Yugi enters Kaiba&#x27;s tournament to show Shougo that one can have both the potential and the power to become a true Duelist. After the game, Kaiba tells Yugi that their battle is not over yet and informs him he is the only one in the world worth fighting as he leaves the arena.

===&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: The Pyramid of Light&quot;===
Kaiba appears in &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: The Pyramid of Light&quot;. In the wake of his defeat at the Battle City Tournament, he begins to suggest a means of defeating the three Egyptian God Cards that Yugi now holds to defeat him and reclaim his title as world champion. His quest leads him to Pegasus, as he theorized that he would not have created the Egyptian God Cards without creating a means of destroying them. After wagering his three Blue-Eyes White Dragons against the card that Pegasus promised him, Kaiba succeeds in winning their duel, only to find &quot;two&quot; cards within Pegasus&#x27;s deck that could accomplish what he sought. Kaiba challenges Yugi to yet another duel in his Duel Dome, and puts the first of the two cards into play – the enigmatic &quot;Pyramid of Light,&quot; which prevents the Egyptian God Cards from participating in the battle. As the duel proceeds, however, it is revealed that Kaiba had been used as a puppet for the ancient Egyptian sorcerer, Anubis, who placed the Pyramid of Light card in Pegasus&#x27;s deck. The Pyramid&#x27;s powers drain the lifeforces of Yugi and Kaiba as the duel progresses, eventually resurrecting Anubis, who dispatches Kaiba and takes his place in the duel. With Kaiba&#x27;s aid, however, Yugi puts the second mighty card into play – the &quot;Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon&quot;, which is able to destroy any card in play. The Shining Dragon destroys the Pyramid of Light and later wipes out Anubis.

=== &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions&quot; ===
Kaiba appears in &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions,&quot; in which he commissions an excavation to retrieve the disassembled Millennium Puzzle from the ruins of the Millennium chamber. The item had previously housed the spirit of his longtime rival, Pharaoh Atem, whom he hopes to &quot;return to life&quot; in order to settle their ancient score. The excavation is interrupted by Diva, who faces Kaiba in a game of Duel Monsters and steals two pieces of the recovered Puzzle. He keeps one fragment and gives the other to his younger sister Sera, who passes it on to Yugi, as he is the only one who can reassemble the Puzzle, having been the host of Atem. Kaiba has a computer that rebuilds the Millennium Puzzle and discovers the last two pieces are missing. He abducts Diva and approaches Yugi so he can have the two partake in the showcasing of his updated Duel Disk virtual reality technology. He intends to duel both Diva and Yugi, while gambling their pieces of the puzzle. However, Yugi is furious with Diva over what he did to Bakura and insists he duel him instead, which Kaiba agrees to. Yugi defeats Diva, resulting in Bakura&#x27;s return to reality, and while dueling Kaiba, he re-completes the Millennium Puzzle, revealing that the spirit of Atem is no longer inside it. Diva becomes corrupted by the evil powers of the Millennium Ring, and duels both Yugi and Kaiba. Kaiba sacrifices himself during the Duel and makes a final plea for Yugi to call forth Atem. Yugi succeeds in doing so, and he and Atem defeat Diva. Atem and the Millennium Puzzle then fade away, and Kaiba and everyone else return to reality. The film concludes with Kaiba using his technology in conjunction with the Quantum Cube to transport his own consciousness to the afterlife and face Atem.

===Appearances in other media===
Though not seen much in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; series. Kaiba is mentioned as the owner and founder of Duel Academy (Duel Academia), who named the dormitories personally. He also appears in flashbacks, once when Jaden remembers a competition he entered that was held by KaibaCorp and when a reporter sneaks into Duel Academy. The Duel Spirit Kaibaman also appears. He also appears physically, the first time being when he makes a bet on his ownership of the school; he also appears when Sartorius visits him to request the use of his Kaiba Land amusement park. Kaiba has not made any appearances since, though it has been shown that he is the only surviving citizen of Trueman&#x27;s invasion in Domino City. The Kaiba Dome is seen often in &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot;. His company Kaiba Corp is responsible for turning Domino City into New Domino City.

Kaiba appeares in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! R&quot; manga to stop the Tenma Brothers from taking over Kaiba Corp, as part of their plan to try and avenge Pegasus by defeating Yugi, using the Wicked God Cards.

Kaiba also appears in some of the Yu-Gi-Oh! video games as an opponent which the player can duel against or play as, as well as the crossover &quot;Jump Force&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical reception to Kaiba has been mixed. DVD Talk describes Kaiba as an unlikely ally to Yugi, but saw his defeat in the third story arc as predictable. For the fourth season, the reviewer described Kaiba as one of the last heroes. Dan Green and Eric Stuart&#x27;s voice talents were praised, though their deliveries were subject to negative response. THEM Anime Reviews criticized Kaiba, comparing him with another rival, Vegeta, as both possess simplistic characterizations due to their obsession with the leads. Anime News Network described him as a stereotypical manga rival while pointing out the actions he takes to be the best Duel Monster gamer. Although &quot;ANN&quot; mocked the multiple duels between Kaiba and Yugi, ANN praised the balance between their cards as done by Kazuki Takahashi. Manga News described him as too cold-hearted a character in the manga&#x27;s initial chapter; however, the writer noted that he changes in the narrative after being defeated by Yugi and briefly sent into a coma. Chris Homer from &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; praised Kaiba&#x27;s actions in the final arc as he joins Dark Yugi in his fight against Bakura and Zorc in Ancient Egypt while dealing with the life of his predecessor, &quot;Priest Seto&quot;.

The duels between Kaiba&#x27;s and Yugi in &quot;Pyramid of Light&quot; were made fun of by DVD Talk for being a method of creating new cards to be bought by the audience. While reviewing &quot;Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, IGN praised Yugi&#x27;s growth alongside his friends&#x27; as they interact, making them more mature than in the manga and anime. IGN, however, wrote that although Yugi appears to be the movie&#x27;s main character, he is overshadowed by Kaiba. Anime News Network labelled him as &quot;still everyone&#x27;s favorite egoistic lunatic&quot;, as there was no progress in regards to his lack of character arc. &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; criticized the obsessive relationship between Kaiba and the Pharaoh, which came across as romantic. However, the regular Yugi&#x27;s rivalry with Kaiba received a positive response. Richard Eisenbeis from &quot;Kotaku&quot; reviewed the movie favorably, finding Kaiba to be the most important character in the plot, but criticized Kaiba&#x27;s personality for his obsession with Yugi, wanting to face the late Dark Yugi as he does not see Yugi as a worthy opponent. Nevertheless, he finds that thanks to Kaiba, the movie is able to deliver an interesting narrative, despite finding the new characters lacking in appeal. Anime UK News found Kaiba&#x27;s actions inconsistent but praised the deliveries of his Japanese voice actor, Kenjiro Tsuda, which he described as &quot;overdramatic echoing&quot;. Though also commented as the film&#x27;s lead, Atomix found Kaiba&#x27;s obsession to face Dark Yugi exaggerated, and lamented the narrative did not focus in other prominent members from the cast. Blu Ray panned Kaiba&#x27;s characterization for his actions in regards to a rematch with Yami as being repetitive due to the scenario having been done before.

<text>Balboa is a district of Panama City, located at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. It was the former capital of the Panama Canal Zone under American administration.

== History ==

The town of Balboa, founded by the United States during the construction of the Panama Canal, was named after Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the Spanish conquistador credited with discovering the Pacific Ocean. The name was suggested to the Panama Canal Zone authorities by the Peruvian ambassador to Panama. Prior to being drained, filled, and leveled by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the hilly area north of Panama City was home to a few subsistence ranches and unused marshlands.

The town of Balboa, like most towns in the Canal Zone, was served by the Canal Zone Government–operated schools, post office, police and fire stations, commissary, cafeteria, movie theater, service center, bowling alley, and other recreational facilities and company stores. There were several schools in the area, including Balboa Elementary School, Balboa High School, and the private St. Mary&#x27;s School. The town was also home to two private banks, a credit union, a Jewish Welfare Board, several Christian denomination churches, civic clubs (such as the Elks Club and the Knights of Columbus), a Masonic Lodge, a YMCA, several historic monuments, and a miniature Statue of Liberty donated by the Boy Scouts of America.

===Panama Canal Treaties===
Until 1979, when the Canal Zone as a solely U.S. territory was abolished under the terms of the Panama Canal Treaties, the town of Balboa was the administrative center of the Canal Zone, and remained so until midday on December 31, 1999, by which time, according to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, the Panama Canal and all its assets and territories were fully returned to the Panamanian government.

===Panama Canal Administration Building===
The Panama Canal Administration Building, the former seat of the Canal Zone Government and Panama Canal Company, is located in Balboa Heights and continues to perform its duties as the main administration building for the agency that runs the Panama Canal — previously the Panama Canal Commission, now the Panama Canal Authority. The building has large murals painted by William B. Van Ingen depicting the construction of the canal.

=== Balboa Naval Transmitting Station ===
A United States Navy very-low-frequency transmitting station (callsign NBA) near Balboa began service around 1915. It transmitted orders to submerged submarines.

== Port of Balboa ==
Balboa is the Pacific-side port of the Panama Canal. The port has a dry dock in Panamax size (even the gates have a construction similar to that of the locks of the Panama canal). In 2012, Balboa was ranked the busiest container port in Latin America.

Balboa has a multimodal (ship-to-train) terminal, called the Pacific Terminal, connected to Colón by the Panama Canal Railway. This allows transportation of containers by train across the isthmus. The railway also runs a passenger service between Panama City and Colón, once a day, each way.

== Climate ==

== Current highlights ==

Formerly a part of the Canal Zone, Balboa is now part of Panama City&#x27;s township of Ancón. Since its incorporation into the Republic of Panama, part of Balboa has been developed to enhance the port&#x27;s capacity and to adapt to private ownership of residences (previously owned by the U.S. Government/Canal Zone Government/Panama Canal Company, and rented to employees thereof) and some small companies and restaurants. The rapid growth of the West-side population of Panama&#x27;s province has resulted in increased car traffic because one of the only two ways available to cross towards the west side of the country is the Bridge of the Americas, which is an issue being solved by the construction of new streets. Demographic changes resulting from the departure of most of the American population (because of Torrijos-Carter Treaties) brought the closure of related facilities and institutions, such as Balboa High School and some English-language churches, obviously because they were mostly available for Americans.

Sightseeing highlights for anyone visiting Balboa during the 2020s include the Administration Building, &quot;Mi Pueblito Afroantillano&quot;, scenic overlook of Ancon Hill (from which a set of locks of the Canal can be seen), monument &quot;Homenaje a la Democracia&quot;, the Goethals Memorial, the Prado, two handicraft markets, three bed-and-breakfast hotels, and a country store and café near the Administration Building.

The population as of the 1990 census was 1,214.

<doc id="529029" wikidata="Q7791268" url="?curid=529029" title="Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology">
<text>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (also known as TJHSST, Thomas Jefferson, or TJ) is a Virginia state-chartered magnet high school in Fairfax County, Virginia operated by Fairfax County Public Schools. The school occupies the building of the previous Thomas Jefferson High School, constructed in 1964. A selective admissions program was initiated in 1985 through the cooperation of state and county governments and corporate sponsorship from the defense and technology industries. It is one of 18 Virginia Governor&#x27;s Schools, and a founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology.

Attendance at the school is open to students in six local jurisdictions based on academic achievement described in the Student Portrait Sheet—a compilation of 4 essays, problem-solving skills—assessed by the Problem Solving Essay, an unweighted grade-point average consisting of 7th grade final grades—8th grade first quarter grades—and summer grades, and socio-economic background. Before the 2020–21 school year, the admissions process also involved a math, reading, and science exam.

== History ==
===20th century===
Thomas Jefferson High School was constructed and opened in 1964. Fairfax County Public Schools&#x27; superintendent William J. Burkholder and his staff began working on the idea of a science high school in 1983 with advice from the superintendent&#x27;s business/advisory council. Burkholder announced the plans for the magnet school in January 1984. The school board chose Thomas Jefferson High School as the location for the new magnet school in June 1984 and approved the funding in February 1985. 

The school was originally intended to only serve Fairfax County students, but after Virginia governor Charles S. Robb chose Fairfax County as the location of a regional science and technology school, the school board voted to accept the funding from the state and allow students from Arlington, Loudoun, and Prince William counties and from the Cities of Fairfax and Falls Church to attend as well. The business community played a significant role in the creation of the school, providing around $3 million in contributions and advice on the school&#x27;s curriculum. Hazleton Laboratories (now Fortrea), Honeywell, AT&amp;T, Dominion Energy, Sony Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, and other companies made contributions in equipment or finances to the school before it opened. Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology opened in fall 1985 with 400 ninth-graders and 125 seniors who were selected from 1,200 applicants.

===21st century===
From 2013 to 2017, the school underwent renovations, adding additional research labs, internet cafes, three-dimensional art galleries, a black box theater, and a dome reminiscent of President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello. The renovations cost $90 million.

In the 2020s, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) underwent three major controversies regarding its admissions process, intentionally delayed distribution of National Merit awards, and its relationship with Chinese entities. The school replaced its test-based admissions with a holistic review process in 2020, leading to significant demographic changes and legal challenges. Additionally, it was revealed that between 2014 and 2021, the school&#x27;s Partnership Fund had received $3.6 million from Chinese Communist Party-linked entities in exchange for the school&#x27;s intellectual property and curriculum. Amidst these controversies, Principal Ann Bonitatibus resigned in October 2024; she stated in an email to parents that she had &quot;pursued and accepted&quot; a &quot;promotion&quot; to the Fairfax County Public Schools&#x27; Human Resources department, which drew widespread skepticism.

== Admissions ==
The school is part of the Fairfax County Public Schools system of Fairfax County, Virginia. Students from Fairfax, Arlington, Loudoun, and Prince William counties and from the Cities of Fairfax and Falls Church are eligible for admission. Students must be enrolled in Algebra 1 or a higher level math class in 8th grade and have a minimum GPA of 3.5 to be eligible.

The admissions process is based on grade point average, a math or science related problem solving essay, a student portrait sheet demonstrating skills and character, and details about a student&#x27;s socio-economic background including whether they are economically disadvantaged, a special education student, or an English language learner. Each public school is allocated a number of seats equal to 1.5% of that school&#x27;s 8th grade student population; the remaining seats are unallocated and offered to the highest evaluated remaining students. During the admissions process, students are identified only by a number; admissions officers do not know their race, ethnicity, sex, or name.

Before the 2020–21 school year, the admissions process also included a math, reading, and science exam.

===Demographics and exam controversy===

The admissions process and the demographics of the student body it produces, in particular the under-representation of black and Hispanic students relative to the school system overall, have been a source of controversy throughout the school&#x27;s history.

After the school&#x27;s early graduating classes included relatively few black and Hispanic students, FCPS created a race-based affirmative action program to admit more black and Hispanic students. The program was in effect for the admissions process for the graduating classes of 1997 through 2002; the county ended it because of legal challenges to similar programs. Following the end of this program, the share of black and Hispanic students at the school decreased from 9.4 percent in 1997–98 to 3.5 percent in 2003–04. Black and Hispanic students remained significantly under-represented at the school through the 2000s and 2010s.

In 2012, a civil rights complaint against the school was filed with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights by &quot;Coalition of the Silence,&quot; an advocacy group led by former county School Board member Tina Hone, and the Fairfax chapter of the NAACP, alleging that it discriminated against black, Hispanic, and disabled students. In response, the Office of Civil Rights, in September 2012, opened an investigation.

In 2020, the school board made a number of significant changes to the admissions process meant to increase the ratio of black and Hispanic students admitted. These included the elimination of the application fee; the increase of the number of admitted students from around 480 to 550; the elimination of an entrance exam; the allocation of seats to each middle school equal to 1.5% of their 8th grade student population; and the addition of &quot;experience factors&quot; including whether students are economically disadvantaged, English language learners, or special education students. Following these changes, the proportion of black and Hispanic students admitted increased from 4.52% to 18.36% while the proportion of Asian Americans decreased from 73.05% to 54.36%. The proportion of female students admitted also increased, from 41.80% to 46.00%, and to 55.45% the next year.

In March 2021, the Coalition for TJ, an advocacy group opposed to the changes and represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation, sued the Fairfax County school board, alleging that the 2020 changes to the admissions process discriminated against Asian Americans. In February 2022, judge Claude M. Hilton of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled in &quot;Coalition for TJ v. Fairfax County School Board&quot; in the Coalition for TJ&#x27;s favor and ordered the school to return to the previous admissions process. The school board appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and in March 2022 that court issued a stay on the order that allowed the school to continue the new admissions process while the case was pending. The Supreme Court of the United States rejected a request to vacate the stay in April 2022. The case was heard in the court of appeals on September 16, 2022, and decided on May 23, 2023. The Fourth Circuit, by a 2 to 1 vote, reversed the district court and restored the new admission plan. The Fourth Circuit&#x27;s decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court rejected to review the case on February 20, 2024 with Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissenting from the denial.

==Curriculum==
TJ&#x27;s curriculum is focused on college preparation and provides students with the opportunity to achieve in all disciplines, with an emphasis on science and technology. 

=== TJ3Sat and TJREVERB projects ===
The Systems Engineering Course designed and built a CubeSat which was launched on November 19, 2013, from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Orbital Sciences Corporation donated the CubeSat Kit to the school on December 6, 2006, and provided the launch for the satellite. After a successful launch at 8:15PM EST, TJ3SAT became the first satellite launched into space that was built by high school students. The launched satellite contained a 4-watt transmitter operating on amateur radio frequencies, and a text-to-speech module to allow it to broadcast ASCII-encoded messages sent to it from Jefferson.

TJREVERB, a 2U CubeSat, is the school&#x27;s second CubeSat mission. After a 6-year period of planning, building, and testing from 2016 to 2022 that was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, REVERB was launched aboard SpaceX&#x27;s CRS-26 on November 26, 2022, at 2:20PM EST. REVERB was deployed from the International Space Station on December 29, 2022, via Nanoracks. The satellite is being located through crowdsourcing, with help from AMSAT. It will test the Iridium satellite radio and connect to the students&#x27; ground station through email.

=== Computer Systems Lab ===

The school&#x27;s computer systems lab is one of the few high school computing facilities with a supercomputer. In 1988, a team from the school won an ETA-10P supercomputer in the SuperQuest competition, a national science competition for high school students. The ETA-10P was damaged by a roof leak in the 1990s. Cray Inc. donated a new SV1 supercomputer, known as Seymour, to the school on December 4, 2002, which is on display as of 2024.

The lab also supported a number of Sun Microsystems thin clients for use by students enrolled in AP Computer Science. In 2008, the school received a grant from Sun Microsystems for $388,048, which was student-written. The Syslab was given 7 Sun workstations, 12 Sun servers, and 145 Sun Rays for distribution throughout the school. These were placed in the existing AP Computer Science Lab and the science classrooms, support backend services, and serve as kiosks placed around the school for guests, students, and faculty. However, the Sun Rays were taken out of the AP Computer Science Lab due to teachers&#x27; objections. By 2014, the Sun Ray clients were decommissioned, and replaced with Linux-based thin clients running LTSP.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2021 and 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked TJ as the best overall high school in the United States. It was previously ranked fourth in 2020, tenth in 2019, and sixth in 2018. In 2016, the school placed first in &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s annual &quot;America&#x27;s Top High Schools&quot; rankings for the third consecutive year. The average SAT score for the graduating class of 2020 was 1528 and the average ACT score was 34.5.

The school had 14 Intel Science Talent Search Semifinalists in 2007, 15 in 2009, and 13 in 2010. In 2024, 7 were named.

In 2007, for schools with more than 800 students in grades 10–12, TJ was cited as having the highest-performing AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP French Language, AP Government and Politics, U.S., and AP U.S. History courses among all schools worldwide. In 2014, 3864 AP Exams were taken by students; over 97% earned a score of 3, 4, or 5.

President Barack Obama signed the America Invents Act into law on September 16, 2011, at the school. The law was made to reform U.S. patent laws.

In 1997, 2000, 2013, and 2017, the wind ensemble of the school was among fifteen high-school bands invited to the Music for All National Concert Band Festival in Indianapolis.

==Merit award controversy==
In December 2022, it was reported that during the previous five years, some students at the school who had been named National Merit Scholarship Commended Scholars had not been notified of their achievement until several months after the school was given the awards to distribute to the students, too late for the students to include with their college applications. A lawyer named Shawnna Yashar, whose son was one of the students at the school whose commendation information had not been reported by the school, said, &quot;Keeping these certificates from students is theft by the state.&quot; School officials stated that the issue was a &quot;one-time human error.&quot; This led to an investigation of 17 Virginia schools and prompted Governor Glenn Youngkin to propose legislation mandating immediate notification of such opportunities to parents and students.

<text>Microsoft Visio (, ), formerly Microsoft Office Visio, is a diagramming and vector graphics application and is part of the Microsoft 365 Business. The product was first introduced in 1992 by former American software company Visio Corporation, and its latest version is Visio 2021. Microsoft acquired the assets of Visio Corporation in 2000. A lightweight version of Visio is now included with all commercial SKU of Microsoft 365 and is known as &quot;Visio in Microsoft 365&quot;. It has two other subscription based SKUs. &quot;Visio Plan 1&quot; includes the Visio web app whereas &quot;Visio Plan 2&quot; provides access to both the web app and the Desktop application.

== Features ==
Microsoft Visio is used to create diagram types such as flowcharts, org charts, floor plans, network diagrams, UML diagrams, mind maps and more. It is also commonly used for scenarios such as Process Mapping and Visual Collaboration. The latest version of Visio also has data visualization that allows users to create diagrams from Excel data and also embed Visio diagrams in Power BI dashboards.

Microsoft made Visio 2013 for Windows available in two editions: Standard and Professional. The Standard and Professional editions share the same interface, but the Professional edition has additional templates for more advanced diagrams and layouts, as well as capabilities intended to make it easy for users to connect their diagrams to data sources and to display their data graphically. The Professional edition features three additional diagram types, as well as intelligent rules, validation, and subprocess (diagram breakdown). Visio Professional is also offered as an additional component of an Office365 subscription.

On September 22, 2015, Visio 2016 was released alongside Microsoft Office 2016. A few new features were added, including one-step connectivity to Excel data, information-rights management (IRM) protection for Visio files, modernized shapes for office layout, detailed shapes for site plans, updated shapes for floor plans, modern shapes for home plans, IEEE-compliant shapes for electrical diagrams, new range of starter diagrams, and new themes for the Visio interface.

Database modelling in Visio revolves around a Database Model Diagram (DMD).

=== File formats ===
All of the previous versions of Visio used VSD, the proprietary binary-file format. Visio 2010 added support for the VDX file format, which is a well-documented XML Schema-based (&quot;DatadiagramML&quot;) format, but still uses VSD by default only.

Visio 2013 drops support for writing VDX files in favor of the new VSDX and VSDM file formats, and uses them by default. Created based on Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) standard (ISO 29500, Part 2), a VSDX or VSDM file consists of a group of XML files archived inside a Zip file. VSDX and VSDM files differ only in that VSDM files may contain macros. Since these files are susceptible to macro virus infection, the program enforces strict security on them.

While VSD files use LZW-like lossless compression, VDX is not compressed. Hence, a VDX file typically takes up 3 to 5 times more storage. VSDX and VSDM files use the same compression as Zip files.

Visio also supports saving files in SVG files, other diagramming files and images. However, images cannot be opened by the program.

== History ==
Visio began as a standalone product produced by Shapeware Corporation; version 1.0 shipped in 1992. A pre-release, Version 0.92, was distributed free on a floppy disk along with a Microsoft Windows systems readiness evaluation utility. In 1995, Shapeware Corporation changed their name to Visio Corporation to take advantage of market recognition and related product equity. Microsoft acquired Visio in 2000, re-branding it as a Microsoft Office application. Like Microsoft Project, however, it has never been officially included in any of the bundled Office suites. Microsoft included a Visio for Enterprise Architects edition with some editions of Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2005.

Along with Microsoft Visio 2002 Professional, Microsoft introduced Visio Enterprise Network Tools and Visio Network Center. Visio Enterprise Network Tools was an add-on product that enabled automated network and directory services diagramming. Visio Network Center was a subscription-based website where users could locate the latest network documentation content and exact-replica network equipment shapes from 500 leading manufacturers. Visio Enterprise Network Tools was discontinued in July 2002. The following year, Microsoft released a patch which gave Enterprise Network Tools users access to the network equipment shapes via Visio&#x27;s built-in Find Shape feature. Visio 2007 was released on November 30, 2006.

Microsoft Visio adopted ribbons in its user interface in Visio 2010. Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Outlook (to some extents) had already adopted the ribbon with the release of Microsoft Office 2007.

November 19, 2012: BPMN 2.0 was utilized within Microsoft Visio.

There are no Visio versions 7, 8, or 9, because after Microsoft acquired and branded Visio as a Microsoft Office product, the Visio version numbers followed the Office version numbers. Version 13 was skipped owing to triskaidekaphobia.

Visio does not have a macOS version, which has led to the growth of several third-party applications which can open and edit Visio files on Mac.

On 7 May 2001, Microsoft introduced &quot;Visio Enterprise Network Tools&quot; (VENT), an add-on for Visio 2002 scheduled for release on 1 July 2001, and &quot;Visio Network Center&quot;, a subscription-based web service for IT professionals who use Microsoft Visio for computer network diagramming. VENT was discontinued on 1 July 2002 because of very low customer demand.

<text>Franz Paul Lachner (2 April 180320 January 1890) was a German composer and conductor.

==Biography==
Lachner was born in Rain am Lech to a musical family (his brothers Ignaz, and Vinzenz also became musicians). He studied music with Simon Sechter and Maximilian Stadler. He conducted at the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna. In 1834, he became &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at Mannheim. As a result of composers&#x27; aesthetic comparisons of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonic output with efforts afterwards, in 1835, there was a competition in Vienna for the best new symphony sponsored by Tobias Haslinger of the music publishing firm with no fewer than 57 entries. Lachner received first prize with his 5th Symphony &quot;Sinfonia passionata, or Preis-Symphonie&quot; and became royal &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at Munich, becoming a major figure in its musical life, conducting at the opera and various concerts and festivals. His career there came to a sudden end in 1864 after Richard Wagner&#x27;s disciple Hans von Bülow took over Lachner&#x27;s duties. Lachner remained officially in his post on extended leave for a few years until his contract expired.

==Work==

Lachner was a well-known and prolific composer in his day, though he is not now considered a major composer. His work, influenced by Beethoven and his friend Franz Schubert, is regarded as competent and craftsman-like, but is now generally little known. Among his greatest successes were his opera &quot;Catharina Cornaro&quot; (1841, preceding Donizetti&#x27;s opera by three years), his &quot;Requiem&quot;, and his seventh orchestral suite (1881).

In the present day it may be his organ sonatas (Opp. 175, 176, 177) and chamber music, in particular his music for wind instruments, that receive the most attention, though his string quartets and some of his eight symphonies have been performed and recorded. His songs, some of which are set to the same texts that Schubert used, contributed to the development of the German &quot;Lied&quot;.

For performances of Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot; in Frankfurt in 1855, Lachner composed recitatives to replace the original spoken dialogue, and it was this version, translated into Italian, which was used in many twentieth-century revivals and recordings of that opera, most notably those with Maria Callas in the title role.

<text>Visio Corporation was a software company based in Seattle, Washington, USA. Its principal product was a diagramming application software of the same name. It was acquired by Microsoft and is now in a division of that company, which continues to develop the application under the name Microsoft Visio.

==History==
Axon Corporation was incorporated May 1, 1989, shortly after Jeremy Jaech left Aldus. Later, in summer 1990, Jeremy Jaech and Ted Johnson met to come up with the initial product definition and then in the fall of 1990 recruited Dave Walter as their third founder. All of its founders came from Aldus Corporation: Jeremy Jaech and Dave Walter were two of Aldus&#x27;s original founders, and Ted Johnson was the lead developer of Aldus PageMaker for Windows.

In 1992, before it had released a single product, the company changed its name to Shapeware. It finally released its first application, Visio, in November of that year.

When Shapeware released Visio 4.0 on August 18, 1995, it was one of the first applications developed specifically for Windows 95.

In November 1995, Shapeware changed its own name to Visio and on November 9, 1995, marked its initial public offering of stock under the ticker VSIO.

On January 7, 2000, Microsoft Corporation acquired Visio in a stock swap. Microsoft gave Visio shareholders 0.45 Microsoft shares for each Visio share. Based on the value of Microsoft stock when the deal closed, the trade was worth approximately US$1.5 billion. This was Microsoft&#x27;s largest acquisition until they acquired aQuantive.

<text>Richard James Hieb (born September 21, 1955 in Jamestown, North Dakota) is a former NASA astronaut and a veteran of three Space Shuttle missions. He was a mission specialist on STS-39 and STS-49, and was a payload commander on STS-65. After leaving NASA he worked at AlliedSignal and Orbital before spending 14 years as an executive at Lockheed Martin. He is currently a faculty member in the University of Colorado Boulder Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department.

==Early life and education==

Hieb&#x27;s family originates from many places in Europe, and includes one line that came to the Americas in the 1600s. The name Hieb is of German origin. His mother was a long time elementary school teacher at Lincoln Elementary in Jamestown, North Dakota and his father was a transport driver before retiring and operating a small business buying and selling antiques and specialty items where he was a well-known figure at sales around eastern North Dakota.

Hieb received a Bachelor of Arts degree in math and physics from Northwest Nazarene College in 1977. He went on to graduate from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1979 with a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering.

==NASA career==

Upon graduation from CU/Boulder, Hieb went to NASA/JSC to work in crew procedures development and crew activity planning. He worked in the Mission Control Center on the ascent team for STS-1, and during rendezvous phases on numerous subsequent flights. He has an extensive background in on-orbit procedures development, particularly in rendezvous and proximity operations. Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985, Hieb qualified July 1986 for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. A veteran of three space flights, Hieb flew on STS-39 in 1991, STS-49 in 1992, and STS-65 in 1994. He logged over 750 hours in space, including over 17 hours of EVA (spacewalk), traveling over 13 million miles.

Hieb first flew on the crew of STS-39, an unclassified Department of Defense mission which launched on April 28, 1991, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During the mission, he was responsible for operating the Infrared Background Signature Satellite from within the payload bay, on the Remote Manipulator System and as a free-flying satellite. He also operated the remote system to release the satellite, and then to retrieve the satellite a day and a half later. After 134 orbits of the Earth which covered 3.5 million miles (5,600,000 km) and lasted just over 199 hours, the crew landed at California, on May 6, 1991.

Hieb was also a mission specialist on the crew of STS-49, the maiden voyage of the new Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center on May 7, 1992. During that mission, Hieb along with astronaut Pierre Thuot, performed three spacewalks which resulted in the capture and repair of the stranded Intelsat VI F3 communications satellite. The third spacewalk, which also included astronaut Tom Akers, was the first ever (and to date only) three-person spacewalk. This 8 hour and 29 minute spacewalk, the longest in history, broke a twenty-year-old record that was held by Apollo 17 astronauts. The STS-49 record endured for 9 years until being surpassed by James Voss and Susan Helms on the International Space Station, and now stands in second place for EVA duration. The mission concluded on May 16, 1992 with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base after orbiting the Earth 141 times in 213 hours and traveling 3.7 million miles (5.9 million kilometres).

Hieb was the payload commander on the second flight of the International Microgravity Laboratory on Space Shuttle Mission STS-65. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 8, 1994, and returned there on July 23, 1994, setting a new flight duration record for the Space Shuttle program. During the 15-day flight the crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles (9.8 million kilometres).

<text>William Grainger Blount (1784 – May 21, 1827) was an American politician who represented Tennessee&#x27;s 2nd district in the United States House of Representatives from 1815 to 1819. He is the son of Southwest Territory governor William Blount and nephew of Tennessee governor Willie Blount, serving under the latter as Tennessee Secretary of State from 1811 to 1815.

==Life and career==
Blount was born near New Bern, North Carolina, in Craven County, the eldest son of William Blount and Mary Grainger Blount. He attended the New Bern Academy. In 1792, following his father&#x27;s appointment as Governor of the Southwest Territory, he moved with his parents to Knoxville, which had been chosen as the new territorial capital. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1805. He was never married and had no known children.

Blount practiced law in Knoxville. He also engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1811, he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. Shortly afterward, the General Assembly elected him Secretary of State of Tennessee. Serving alongside his uncle, Governor Willie Blount, he helped coordinate the state&#x27;s War of 1812 efforts, and certified the &quot;Walker Line&quot; as the boundary between Tennessee and Kentucky.

Following the death of John Sevier in 1815, Blount was elected to his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, narrowly defeating John Cocke by a vote of 1,583 to 1,355. He was reelected in 1817, again defeating Cocke by a narrow margin, 3,627 votes to 3,429. Serving as a Democratic-Republican in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth congresses, Blount consistently sought the creation of new postal routes throughout his district, including a route connecting Maryville and Sevierville, a route connecting Sevierville and Dandridge, and a route connecting Morganton, Tennessee, with Carnesville, Georgia. He voted in favor of an 1816 bill reaffirming the nation&#x27;s neutrality, and voted against the Bonus Bill of 1817 (he also voted in favor of sustaining President James Madison&#x27;s veto of the Bonus Bill).

Choosing not to run for a third term, Blount resumed his practice of law in Knoxville. In 1818, he became owner of Blount Mansion, the house his father had built in the city. He moved to Paris, Tennessee, in 1826, where he continued to practice law. He died on May 21, 1827, and is interred in the City Cemetery in Paris, Tennessee.

<text>The Zeya (; from indigenous Evenki word &quot;djee&quot; (blade); ; , Mölendroff: jingkiri bira) is a northern, left tributary of the Amur in Amur Oblast, Russia. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . The average flow of the river is .

==History==
The first Russian documented to enter the area was Vassili Poyarkov.

==Course==
It rises in the Toko-Stanovik mountain ridge, a part of the Stanovoy Range.

The Zeya flows through the Zeya Reservoir, at the junction of the Tukuringra Range and Dzhagdy Range, and joins the Amur near Blagoveshchensk, at the border with China. Regulation of river discharge by Zeya Dam mitigates extremities of river flow down to 5000 m³/s. The Zeya contributes around 16% of both the average and maximum flow of de Amur because of the flow regulations. In the past, the Zeya could have contributed up to almost 50% of the Amur&#x27;s maximum flow of approximately 30,000 m³/s.

The main tributaries of the Zeya are Tok, Mulmuga, Bryanta, Gilyuy, and Urkan on the right, and Kupuri, Argi, Dep, Selemdzha, and Tom on the left.

The river freezes from November to May. When it is unfrozen, the river is navigable with the most important river ports being Zeya, Svobodny, and Blagoveshchensk.

<text>By Fire and Sword () is a historical novel by the Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz, published in 1884. It is the first volume of a series known to Poles as The Trilogy, followed by &quot;The Deluge&quot; (&quot;Potop&quot;, 1886) and &quot;Fire in the Steppe&quot; (originally published under the Polish title &quot;Pan Wołodyjowski&quot;, which translates to &quot;Lord Wolodyjowski&quot;). The novel has been adapted as a film several times, most recently in 1999.

&quot;By Fire and Sword&quot; is a historical fiction novel, set in the 17th century in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. It was initially serialized in several Polish newspapers, chapters appearing in weekly installments. It gained enormous popularity in Poland, and by the turn of the 20th century had become one of the most popular Polish books ever. It became obligatory reading in Polish schools, and has been translated into English and most European languages.

The series was a vehicle for expressing Polish patriotism in a Poland partitioned and deprived of independence.

==Plot==
Despite some deviations, the book&#x27;s historical framework is genuine and the fictional story is woven into real events. Many characters are historical figures, including Jeremi Wiśniowiecki and Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sienkiewicz researched memoirs and chronicles of the Polish nobility, or szlachta, for details on life in 17th-century Poland. The book was written, according to the author, &quot;to lift up the heart&quot; of the Polish nation in the unhappy period following the failed January Uprising during the era of the partitions of Poland. Thus it often favors epic plots and heroic scenes over historical accuracy. Nonetheless, Sienkiewicz&#x27;s vivid language made it one of the most popular books about that particular place and era.

===Chapters I–VIII===
Jan Skrzetuski, lieutenant of the armoured regiment of Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, gives assistance to Bohdan Zenobi Chmielnicki (first posing as Abdank) as his party are returning from a mission to the Khan through the Wilderness. At Czyhryn the next day, Skrzetuski learns that Chmielnicki was escaping to the Sich. In a tavern he throws Czapliński, a voluble under–starosta (and Chmielnicki&#x27;s deadly enemy), out through the door. It is here that he also becomes acquainted with Zagłoba and the Lithuanian Podbipięta, who wishes to join the service of Prince Jeremi in order to fulfil his family vow of cutting off the heads of three infidels, all at the same time with one blow.

On their way to Lubni, the party comes to the assistance of two women, one of whom is Helena Kurcewicz, returning to her aunt&#x27;s home that really belongs to her. Jan&#x27;s party are invited back to Rozlogi where Jan meets Bohun, a Cossack, adopted as a sixth son by the old princess (Helena&#x27;s aunt). Bohun wants to pick a quarrel but is sent away and Jan is able to declare his love for Helena. Skrzetuski realizes the girl is being mistreated and denied her rights so gets the princess to promise Helena to him instead of Bohun or he will have Prince Jeremi help her recover home. The lieutenant finally arrives at Lubni and tells his comrades about his mission to the Crimea. Prince Jeremi returns and entertainments are laid on. To wile away the time, Skrzetuski fences with his friend, Michał Wołodyjowski, and receives a response to his letter sent to Helena via Rzędzian, his assistant.

Revolution is now afoot. The prince decides to send an envoy, in a group led by Pan (Sir) Bychowiec, to the Sich to find out about Chmielnicki. Jan persuades him to let him go in his place as he wants to see Helena and receives permission from the prince. He meets Helena once more at Rozlogi and then sets out for Czyhryn. Here, he meets Zaćwilichowski , an old colonel, who says he expects revolt in Ukraine. He also re-encounters Zagłoba who tells him that he has befriended Bohun. Further on his travels he decides to send Rzędzian with a message to Helena to flee the impending hordes. His party encounters some Cossacks and Tartars and a fight breaks out in which Jan&#x27;s soldiers are slaughtered and he severely wounded. The alliance between the Cossacks and Tartars had been brokered by Chmielnicki, who understood that Cossacks, while having an excellent infantry, could not hope to match the Polish cavalry, the best in Europe. By combining Cossack infantry with Tartar cavalry, the uprising had balanced military force and a chance to beat the Polish army.

===Chapters IX–XV===
The messages to the friends in the court are discovered and two, Barabasz (Barabash) and Tatarczuk (Tatarchuk), are murdered by the Brotherhood of Cossacks. Tuhaj-bej (Tugay Bey), the Tartar leader, is given Jan as a ransom captive and news arrives that the Great Hetman, Mikołaj Potocki, has sent his son Stefan (Stephen) with his army against the Brotherhood, so Chmielnicki is chosen as their leader. The Zaporojians and Tartars march out of the Sitch to meet the Poles marching from Czyhryn. Chmielnicki avoids besieging Kudak. Krzeszowski, a Cossack, is sent to support Potocki but is won over by talks with Chmielnicki and massacres the German mercenaries who refuse to support his betrayal. At Żółte Wody (Zhovti Vody) the Polish hussars become bogged down in the soft mud and cannot attack on the second day of the battle, so Chmielnicki wins it and another at Kruta Bałka.

===Chapters XVI–XXVII===

Chmielnicki frees Jan to parley with the Prince. Skrzetuski passes through a devastated landscape to Czyhryn and then to Rozlogi, where he discovers that Helena has disappeared. He mistakenly believes that Helena has been spirited away by Bohun. In reality, after capturing Rzędzian and discovering Skrzetuski&#x27;s plan to marry Helena, Bohun went immediately to Rozlogi to wed her. However, Zagłoba, who accompanied him, spirited her away after Bohun was wounded by Mikołaj (Nicholas), one of the old Princess&#x27; sons. Instead of heading for Lubni, they headed for Czerkasy but are caught between Bohun&#x27;s force and Chmielnicki&#x27;s advancing army. To disguise themselves Zagłoba pounces on an old blind minstrel and a young boy and steals their clothes. At a village named Demianówka (Demianovka), Zagłoba persuades the villagers to flee to Chmielnicki&#x27;s force taking himself and Helena with them. Zagłoba eventually decides the safest place is on the right bank of the Dnieper and, just as they are crossing, Bohun&#x27;s Cossacks appear at the river&#x27;s bank but it is too late to stop the runaways.

Prince Jeremi&#x27;s army arrives at Rozlogi and Skrzetuski is reunited with Wiśniowiecki. After returning to Lubni, preparations are made to march and Lubni is abandoned to its fate. They end up marching through the forests to Czernihów (Chernigov) where Chmielnicki attempts to burn the wood. They eventually cross the Dnieper and go through the Pripet Marshes, and reach the region of revolt where they wreak revenge on the Cossacks. The Brotherhood meet to determine how to respond and eventually Maksim Krzywonos (Krivonos) agrees to lead a 60,000 army to Machnówka (Makhnivka) to fight the Prince. His son besieges the castle but the Prince&#x27;s hussars eventually crush the rebels.

===Chapters XXVIII–XLV===
Skrzetuski is dispatched to persuade some German infantry to the Prince Jeremi&#x27;s side but they refuse. On his way back he attacks an outlaw camp and finds Zagłoba amongst them; he tells Jan Helena is safe in the castle in Bar. The Polish army passes Konstantynów (Konstantinoff) and halts at Rosołowce (Rosolovtsi) where they are now joined by the German infantry fleeing from Chmielnicki. Krzywonos arrives with his forces, the battle starts with single hand-to-hand combat, and Krzywonos is eventually defeated. Rzędzian is reunited with his master.

The King dies and a disputed succession takes place. Jeremi and his army rest at the castle of Zbaraż (Zbaraj) where, after much internal struggle, the Prince announces he will submit to the commanders appointed by the Commonwealth. Bohun captures Helena at Bar and hides her with a witch, Horpyna, at Horpyna&#x27;s house. Helena threatens to stab herself when Bohun speaks to her about marriage, having tried to do so when she was captured at Bar. Skrzetuski and his colleagues go out to crush marauding bands. He is forced to split his force, putting parts of it under the command of Podbipięta, Wołodyjowski, and Zagłoba. Zagłoba is captured with his men by Bohun&#x27;s Cossacks after they get drunk at a peasant wedding, but they are freed by Wołodyjowski and his troops.

The four Polish officers return to Jarmolińce (Yarmolintsi) and Zagłoba reveals that he overheard during his captivity that Helena is hidden somewhere between Jampol (Yampol) and Jahorlik (Yagorlik). Wierszułł (Vershul) arrives and reveals that the Poles, under Prince Dominik Zasławski, have been ignominiously defeated. They make for Lwów (Lviv), where Prince Jeremi is elected leader of the Commonwealth forces, and continue to Zamość and afterwards to Warsaw with his wife, Princess Gryzelda (Griselda). Wołodyjowski gets into a quarrel with Charłamp over Anusia Borzobohata. Kazimierz and his brother Karol (Karl) are disputing the election, and the former is elected King. Zagłoba and Wołodyjowski also meet Bohun, travelling as an envoy, and Michał Wołodyjowski leaves him for dead in a duel.

===XLVI–LVII===
Chmielnicki&#x27;s army is besieging Zamość but withdraws for peace negotiations. Zagłoba and Wołodyjowski now head to the castle and Wierszułł tells them that Skrzetuski is looking for Helena, travelling with some Armenian merchants to Jampol. A commission led by voivode Adam Kisiel is sent by the Commonwealth to negotiate with Chmielnicki, which Skrzetuski joins. The commission is rudely received by the Cossack hetman at Perejasław (Pereyaslav), despite giving him a baton from the King. Chmielnicki is pleased to see Jan and promises him 200 Cossack horsemen to accompany him to Kyiv and beyond.

An armistice is concluded but Cossack attacks continue. Skrzetuski is told during his search that Helena was murdered in a monastery with some nuns. He ends up with Prince Korecki at Korets, where he lies ill. Rzędzian reappears and tells Zagłoba that Helena is actually hidden in a ravine at the Waładynka river (Valea Adîncă), to which he was sent by Bohun after Bohun was wounded by Wołodyjowski. Wołodyjowski, Zagłoba and Rzędzian make for Waładynka, where they kill the witch and her servant Czeremis, and rescue Helena. Using Bohun&#x27;s baton, they make for Zbaraż. Just before reaching it, they are pursued by Tartar horsemen. Rzędzian escapes with Helena into a wood, while the two officers make a last stand, only to be rescued by Kuszel (Kushel) and Roztworowski (Roztvorovski) with two thousand horsemen. All of the Crown forces in Ukraine are assembled at Zbaraż, including Skrzetuski, and Jeremi finally arrives. At last, battle can take place between him and Chmielnicki.

In the ensuing fighting outside Zbaraż, Zagłoba is nearly captured by the Cossack leader Burłaj (Burlai), but instead kills his pursuer. The Cossacks are defeated, but Chmielnicki convinces the Khan to keep fighting by appealing to his pride.

===LVIII–LXIII===

The valiant Polish force continues to hold out against the Cossacks and Tartars. Huge assault towers are burnt to the ground by a sally led by Skrzetuski; in the action the Polish soldiers are nearly taken but are saved by the hussars. Chmielnicki summons Zaćwilichowski for negotiations but his monstrous demands are rejected by Prince Jeremi, so the fighting continues. Hunger sets in, and Longin decides to steal through the enemy&#x27;s lines to tell the king of the army&#x27;s plight. However, he is discovered after stumbling into some Tartar horse-herders and is killed by Tartar arrows after a last stand. His naked body is hung from an assault machine, which the Poles storm to cut him down so he can be given a military funeral.

Skrzetuski goes next and, working his way through the swamp, finally makes it through the tabor to Toporów and King Jan Kazimierz, who resolves to rescue Zbaraż. Skrzetuski falls seriously ill from his ordeal, but is nursed by Rzędzian, who tells him Helena is safe. The victorious Polish army returns to Toporów and Skrzetuski and his colleagues ride out to meet the lady of Sandomierz (Sandomir), in whose carriage Helena is travelling. Returning home, the whole happy party stops for a picnic at Grabowa (Grabovo) castle, which has been burnt, and Skrzetuski and his loved one are happily cheered by the soldiers.

==English translations==
The novel was initially translated by Jeremiah Curtin in 1898. Curtin was Sienkiewicz&#x27;s &quot;authorized&quot; translator, meaning the publisher, Little, Brown and Co., paid a commission to Sienkiewicz for his endorsement because at the time, as a foreign work, it was not copyrighted in the USA. Thus, another translation by Samuel A. Binion (who translated many other books by Sienkiewicz) was published by R. F. Fenno and Co. around the same time as Curtin&#x27;s, but without Sienkiewicz&#x27;s endorsement. Both translations have since lapsed into the public domain.

A modern translation was published in 1991 by W. S. Kuniczak, at the behest of the Copernicus Society of America, as part of a series of Polish classics in modern translation.

==Adaptations==
A film version of the novel, &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;, was directed by Jerzy Hoffman and released in 1999. At the time, it was the most expensive Polish film ever made (since surpassed by &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, 2001). Although the novel is the first part of the trilogy, the film was the last part of Hoffman&#x27;s version of the trilogy to be made, following &quot;The Deluge&quot;, which was filmed in 1974, and &quot;Colonel Wolodyjowski&quot;, which was filmed in 1969.

A video game based on the novel, &quot;Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire &amp; Sword&quot;, was published in 2011.

&quot;Invasion 1700&quot;, also known as &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;, is a 1962 Italian-French historical epic film directed by Fernando Cerchio, based on the 1884 novel.

<text>A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG or more commonly MMO) is an online video game with a large number of players to interact in the same online game world. MMOs usually feature a huge, persistent open world, although there are games that differ. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the personal computer, video game console, or smartphones and other mobile devices.

MMOs can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres.

==History==

The most popular type of MMOG, and the subgenre that pioneered the category, is the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), which descended from university mainframe computer MUD and adventure games such as &quot;Rogue&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; on the PDP-10. These games predate the commercial gaming industry and the Internet, but still featured persistent worlds and other elements of MMOGs still used today.

The first graphical MMOG, and a major milestone in the creation of the genre, was the multiplayer flight combat simulation game &quot;Air Warrior&quot; by Kesmai on the GEnie online service, which first appeared in 1986. Kesmai later added 3D graphics to the game, making it the first 3D MMO.

Commercial MMORPGs gained acceptance in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The genre was pioneered by the &quot;GemStone&quot; series on GEnie, also created by Kesmai, and &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, the first such game to include graphics, which debuted on AOL in 1991.

As video game developers applied MMOG ideas to other computer and video game genres, new acronyms started to develop, such as MMORTS. &quot;MMOG&quot; emerged as a generic term to cover this growing class of games.

The debuts of &quot;The Realm Online&quot;, &quot;Meridian 59&quot; (the first 3D MMORPG), &quot;Castle Infinity&quot; (the first kid-focused MMORPG),&quot;Ultima Online&quot;, &quot;Underlight&quot; and &quot;EverQuest&quot; in the late 1990s popularized the MMORPG genre. The growth in technology meant that where Neverwinter Nights in 1991 had been limited to 50 simultaneous players (a number that grew to 500 by 1995), by 2000 a multitude of MMORPGs was each serving thousands of simultaneous players and led the way for games such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;EVE Online&quot;.

Despite the genre&#x27;s focus on multiplayer gaming, AI-controlled characters are still common. NPCs and mobs who give out quests or serve as opponents are typical in MMORPGs. AI-controlled characters are not as common in action-based MMOGs.

The popularity of MMOGs was mostly restricted to the computer game market until the sixth-generation consoles, with the launch of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; on the Dreamcast, as well as the emergence and growth of the online service Xbox Live. There have been a number of console MMOGs, including &quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot; (PlayStation 2), and the multi-console &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. On PCs, the MMOG market has always been dominated by successful fantasy MMORPGs.

MMOGs have only recently begun to break into the mobile phone market. The first, Samurai Romanesque set in feudal Japan, was released in 2001 on NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s iMode network in Japan. More recent developments are CipSoft&#x27;s &quot;TibiaME&quot; and Biting Bit&#x27;s &quot;MicroMonster&quot;, which features online and bluetooth multiplayer gaming. SmartCell Technology is in development of &quot;Shadow of Legend&quot;, which will allow gamers to continue their game on their mobile device when away from their PC.

Science fiction has also been a popular theme, featuring games such as &quot;Mankind&quot;, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, &quot;Eve Online&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;.

MMOGs emerged from the hard-core gamer community to the mainstream strongly in December 2003, with an analysis in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; measuring the value of the virtual property in the then-largest MMOG, &quot;EverQuest&quot;, to result in a per-capita GDP of 2,266 dollars, which would have placed the virtual world of &quot;EverQuest&quot; as the 77th wealthiest nation, on par with Croatia, Ecuador, Tunisia or Vietnam.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; is a dominant MMOG with 8-9 million monthly subscribers worldwide. The subscriber base dropped by one million after the expansion &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, bringing it to nine million subscribers in 2010, though it remained the most popular Western title among MMOGs. In 2008, Western consumer spending on &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; represented a 58% share of the subscription MMOG market in 2009. The title has generated over $2.2 billion in cumulative consumer spending on subscriptions from 2005 through 2009.

==Virtual economies==
Within a majority of the MMOGs created, there is virtual currency where the player can earn and accumulate money. The uses for such virtual currency are numerous and vary from game to game. The virtual economies created within MMOGs often blur the lines between real and virtual worlds. The result is often seen as an unwanted interaction between the real and virtual economies by the players and the provider of the virtual world. This practice (economy interaction) is mostly seen in this genre of games. The two seem to come hand in hand with even the earliest MMOGs, such as &quot;Ultima Online&quot; having this kind of trade: real money for virtual things.

The importance of having a working virtual economy within an MMOG is increasing as they develop. A sign of this is CCP Games hiring the first real-life economist for its MMOG &quot;Eve Online&quot; to assist and analyze the virtual economy and production within this game.

The results of this interaction between the virtual economy, and our real economy, which is really the interaction between the company that created the game and the third-party companies that want a share of the profits and success of the game. This battle between companies is defended on both sides. The company originating the game and the intellectual property argue that this is in violation of the terms and agreements of the game as well as copyright violation since they own the rights to how the online currency is distributed and through what channels. The case that the third-party companies and their customers defend, is that they are selling and exchanging the time and effort put into the acquisition of the currency, not the digital information itself. They also express that the nature of many MMOGs is that they require time commitments not available to everyone. As a result, without external acquisition of virtual currency, some players are severely limited to being able to experience certain aspects of the game.

The practice of acquiring large volumes of virtual currency for the purpose of selling to other individuals for tangible and real currency is called gold farming. Many players who have poured in all of their personal effort resent that there is this exchange between real and virtual economies since it devalues their own efforts. As a result, the term &#x27;gold farmer&#x27; now has a very negative connotation within the games and their communities. This slander has unfortunately also extended itself to racial profiling and to in-game and forum insulting.

The reaction from many of the game companies varies. In games that are substantially less popular and have a small player base, the enforcement of the elimination of &#x27;gold farming&#x27; appears less often. Companies in this situation most likely are concerned with their personal sales and subscription revenue over the development of their virtual economy, as they most likely have a higher priority to the games viability via adequate funding. Games with an enormous player base, and consequently much higher sales and subscription income, can take more drastic actions more often and in much larger volumes. This account banning could also serve as an economic gain for these large games, since it is highly likely that, due to demand, these &#x27;gold farming&#x27; accounts will be recreated with freshly bought copies of the game.

The virtual goods revenue from online games and social networking exceeded US$7 billion in 2010.

In 2011, it was estimated that up to 100,000 people in China and Vietnam are playing online games to gather gold and other items for sale to Western players. While this &#x27;gold farming&#x27; is considered to ruin the game for actual players, many rely on &#x27;gold farming&#x27; as their main source of income.

However, single player in MMOs is quite viable, especially in what is called &#x27;player vs environment&#x27; gameplay. This may result in the player being unable to experience all content, as many of the most significant and potentially rewarding game experiences are events that require large and coordinated teams to complete.

==Technical aspect==
Most MMOGs also share other characteristics that make them different from other multiplayer online games. MMOGs host many players in a single game world, and all of those players can interact with each other at any given time. Popular MMOGs might have hundreds of players online at any given time, usually on company-owned servers. Non-MMOGs, such as &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; or &quot;Half-Life&quot;, usually have fewer than 50 players online (per server) and are usually played on private servers. Also, MMOGs usually do not have any significant mods, since the game must work on company servers. There is some debate if a high head-count is a requirement to be an MMOG. Some say that it is the size of the game world and its capability to support many players that should matter. For example, despite technology and content constraints, most MMOGs can fit up to a few thousand players on a single game server at a time.

To support all those players, MMOGs need large-scale game worlds, and servers to connect players to those worlds. Some games have all of their servers connected so all players are connected in a shared universe. Others have copies of their starting game world put on different servers, called &quot;shards&quot;, for a sharded universe. Shards got their name from &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, where in the story, the shards of Mondain&#x27;s gem created the duplicate worlds.

Still, others will only use one part of the universe at any time. For example, &quot;Tribes&quot; (which is not an MMOG) comes with a number of large maps, which are played in rotation (one at a time). In contrast, the similar title &quot;PlanetSide&quot; allows all map-like areas of the game to be reached via flying, driving, or teleporting.

MMORPGs usually have sharded universes, as they provide the most flexible solution to the server load problem, but not always. For example, the space simulation &quot;Eve Online&quot; uses only one large cluster server peaking at over 60,000 simultaneous players.

It is challenging to develop the database engines that are needed to run a successful MMOG with millions of players. Many developers have created their own, but attempts have been made to create &quot;middleware&quot;, software that would help game developers concentrate on their games more than technical aspects. One such piece of middleware is called BigWorld.

An early, successful entry into the field was VR-1 Entertainment, whose Conductor platform was adopted and endorsed by a variety of service providers around the world including Sony Communications Network in Japan; the Bertelsmann Game Channel in Germany; British Telecom&#x27;s Wireplay in England; and DACOM and Samsung SDS in South Korea. Games that were powered by the Conductor platform included &quot;Fighter Wing&quot;, &quot;Air Attack&quot;, &quot;Fighter Ace&quot;, &quot;Evernight&quot;, Hasbro Em@ail Games (&quot;Clue&quot;, &quot;NASCAR&quot; and &quot;Soccer&quot;), &quot;Towers of Fallow&quot;, &quot;The SARAC Project&quot;, &quot;VR1 Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Rumble in the Void&quot;.

Typical MUDs and other predecessor games were limited to about 64 or 256 simultaneous player connections; this was a limit imposed by the underlying operating system, which was usually Unix-like. One of the biggest problems with modern engines has been handling the vast number of players. Since a typical server can handle around 10,000–12,000 players, 4000–5000 active simultaneously, dividing the game into several servers has up until now been the solution. This approach has also helped with technical issues, such as lag, that many players experience. Another difficulty, especially relevant to real-time simulation games, is time synchronization across hundreds or thousands of players. Many games rely on time synchronization to drive their physics simulation as well as their scoring and damage detection.

Although there is no specific limit to where an online multiplayer online game is considered massive, there are broad features that are often used as a metric. Garriott&#x27;s famed 1997 definition referred to the fundamental architecture shift required to support tens of thousands of concurrent players, which required shifting from individual servers to data centers on multiple continents. Games may have MMO features like large worlds with online persistence but still not generally be considered an MMO, such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;″s online play, while other games like &quot;League of Legends&quot; have small individual sessions but the global infrastructure requirements often allow for classification as an MMO. The term is often used differently by players who tend to refer to their play experience versus game developers who refer to the engineering experience. MMO game developers tend to require tremendous investments in developing and maintaining servers around the globe, network bandwidth infrastructure often on the order of terabytes per second, and large engineering problems relating to managing data spread between multiple computer clusters.

==Game types==
There are several types of massively multiplayer online games.

===Role-playing===

Massively multiplayer online role-playing games, known as MMORPGs, are the most common type of MMOG. Some MMORPGs are designed as a multiplayer browser game in order to reduce infrastructure costs and utilise a thin client that most users will already have installed. The acronym BBMMORPGs has sometimes been used to describe these as &quot;browser-based&quot;.

====Bulletin board role-playing games====
Many games are categorized as MMOBBGs, Massively Multiplayer Online Bulletin Board Games, also called MMOBBRPGs. These particular types of games are primarily made up of text and descriptions, although images are often used to enhance the game.

===First-person shooter===
MMOFPS is an online gaming genre which features many simultaneous players in a first-person shooter fashion. These games provide large-scale, sometimes team-based combat. The addition of persistence in the game world means that these games add elements typically found in RPGs, such as experience points. However, MMOFPS games emphasize player skill more than player statistics, as no number of in-game bonuses will compensate for a player&#x27;s inability to aim and think tactically.

===Real-time strategy===
Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy games, also known as &quot;MMORTS&quot;, combine real-time strategy (RTS) with a persistent world. Players often assume the role of a general, king, or other types of figurehead leading an army into battle while maintaining the resources needed for such warfare. The titles are often based in a sci-fi or fantasy universe and are distinguished from single or small-scale multiplayer RTSes by the number of players and common use of a persistent world, generally hosted by the game&#x27;s publisher, which continues to evolve even when the player is offline.

===Turn-based strategy===

Steve Jackson Games&#x27; &quot;UltraCorps&quot; is an example of an MMO turn-based strategy game. Hundreds of players share the same playing field of conquest. In a &quot;mega&quot; game, each turn fleets are built and launched to expand one&#x27;s personal empire. Turns are usually time-based, with a &quot;tick&quot; schedule usually daily. All orders are processed, and battles resolved, at the same time during the tick. Similarly, in &quot;&quot;, vehicle driving and combat orders are submitted simultaneously by all players and a &quot;tick&quot; occurs typically once per 30 seconds. This allows each player to accurately control multiple vehicles and pedestrians in racing or combat.

===Simulations===

Some MMOGs have been designed to accurately simulate certain aspects of the real world. They tend to be very specific to industries or activities of very large risk and huge potential loss, such as rocket science, airplanes, trucks, battle tanks, submarines etc. Gradually as simulation technology is getting more mainstream, so too various simulators arrive into more mundane industries.

The initial goal of &quot;World War II Online&quot; was to create a map (in northwestern Europe) that had real-world physics (gravity, air/water resistance, etc.), and ability for players to have some strategic abilities to its basic FPS/RPG role. While the current version is not quite a true simulated world, it is very complex and contains a large persistent world.

The MMOG genre of air traffic simulation is one example, with networks such as VATSIM and IVAO striving to provide rigorously authentic flight-simulation environments to players in both pilot and air traffic controller roles. In this category of MMOGs, the objective is to create duplicates of the real world for people who cannot or do not wish to undertake those experiences in real life. For example, flight simulation via an MMOG requires far less expenditure of time and money, is completely risk-free, and is far less restrictive (fewer regulations to adhere to, no medical exams to pass, and so on).

Another specialist area is the mobile telecoms operator (carrier) business where billion-dollar investments in networks are needed but market shares are won and lost on issues from segmentation to handset subsidies. A specialist simulation was developed by Nokia called &quot;Equilibrium/Arbitrage&quot; to have over a two-day period five teams of top management of one operator/carrier play a &quot;wargame&quot; against each other, under extremely realistic conditions, with one operator an incumbent fixed and mobile network operator, another a new entrant mobile operator, a third a fixed-line/internet operator, etc. Each team is measured by outperforming their rivals by market expectations of that type of player. Thus, each player has drastically different goals, but within the simulation, any one team can win. Also to ensure maximum intensity, only one team can win. Telecoms senior executives who have taken the &quot;Equilibrium/Arbitrage&quot; simulation say it is the most intense, and most useful training they have ever experienced. It is typical of business use of simulators, in very senior management training/retraining.

Examples of MMO simulation games include &quot;World of Tanks&quot;, &quot;War Thunder&quot;, &quot;Motor City Online&quot;, &quot;The Sims Online&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

====Sports====
A massively multiplayer online sports game is a title where players can compete in some of the more traditional major league sports, such as football (soccer), basketball, baseball, hockey, golf or American football. According to &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;Baseball Mogul Online&quot; was &quot;the world&#x27;s first massively multiplayer online sports game&quot;. Other titles that qualify as MMOSG have been around since the early 2000s, but only after 2010 did they start to receive the endorsements of some of the official major league associations and players.

====Racing====
MMOR means massively multiplayer online racing. Currently there are only a small number of racing-based MMOGs, including &quot;iRacing&quot;, &quot;Kart Rider&quot;, &quot;Test Drive Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Project Torque&quot;, &quot;Drift City&quot; and &quot;Race or Die&quot;. Other notable MMORs included &quot;Upshift Strikeracer&quot;, &quot;Motor City Online&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed: World&quot;, all of which have since shut down. The &quot;Trackmania&quot; series is the world&#x27;s largest MMO racing game and holds the world record for &quot;Most Players in a Single Online Race&quot;. Although &quot;&quot; is more combat-based than racing, it is also considered an MMOR.

===Casual===
Many types of MMO games can be classified as casual, because they are designed to appeal to all computer users (as opposed to subgroup of frequent game buyers), or to fans of another game genre (such as collectible card games). Such games are easy to learn and require a smaller time commitment than other game types. Other popular casual games include simple management games such as &quot;The Sims Online&quot; or &quot;Kung Fu Panda World.&quot;

MMOPGs, or massively multiplayer online puzzle games, are based entirely on puzzle elements. They are usually set in a world where the players can access the puzzles around the world. Most games that are MMOPGs are hybrids with other genres. &quot;Castle Infinity&quot; was the first MMOG developed for children. Its gameplay falls somewhere between puzzle and adventure.

There are also massively multiplayer collectible card games: &quot;Alteil&quot;, &quot;Astral Masters&quot; and &quot;Astral Tournament&quot;. Other MMOCCGs might exist (&quot;Neopets&quot; has some CCG elements) but are not as well known.

Alternate reality games (ARGs) can be massively multiplayer, allowing thousands of players worldwide to co-operate in puzzle trials and mystery solving. ARGs take place in a unique mixture of online and real-world play that usually does not involve a persistent world, and are not necessarily multiplayer, making them different from MMOGs.

====Music/rhythm====
Massively multiplayer online music/rhythm games (MMORGs), sometimes called massively multiplayer online dance games (MMODGs), are MMOGs that are also music video games. This idea was influenced by &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. &quot;Audition Online&quot; is another casual massively multiplayer online game and it is produced by T3 Entertainment.

&quot;Just Dance 2014&quot; has a game mode called World Dance Floor, which also structures like an MMORPG.

====Social====
Massively multiplayer online social games (MMOSGs) focus on socialization instead of objective-based gameplay. There is a great deal of overlap in terminology with &quot;online communities&quot; and &quot;virtual worlds&quot;. One example that has garnered widespread media attention is Linden Lab&#x27;s &quot;Second Life&quot;, emphasizing socializing, worldbuilding and an in-world virtual economy that depends on the sale and purchase of user-created content. It is technically an MMOSG or Casual Multiplayer Online (CMO) by definition, though its stated goal was to realize the concept of the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. Instead of being based around combat, one could say that it was based around the creation of virtual objects, including models and scripts. In practice, it has more in common with &quot;Club Caribe&quot; than &quot;EverQuest&quot;. It was the first MMO of its kind to achieve widespread success (including attention from mainstream media); however, it was not the first (as &quot;Club Caribe&quot; was released in 1988). Competitors in this subgenre (non-combat-based MMORPG) include &quot;Active Worlds&quot;, &quot;There&quot;, &quot;SmallWorlds&quot;, &quot;Furcadia&quot;, &quot;Whirled&quot;, &quot;IMVU&quot; and &quot;Red Light Center&quot;.

Many browser-based Casual MMOs have begun to spring up. This has been made easier because of maturing of Adobe Flash and the popularity of &quot;Club Penguin&quot;, &quot;Growtopia&quot; and &quot;The Sims Online&quot;.

====Combat====

Massively multiplayer online combat games are realtime objective, strategy and capture the flag style modes.

&quot;Infantry Online&quot; is an example multiplayer combat video game with sprite animation graphics, using complex soldier, ground vehicle and space-ship models on typically complex terrains developed by Sony Online Entertainment.

==Research==
Some recent attempts to build peer-to-peer (P2P) MMOGs have been made. &quot;Outback Online&quot; may be the first commercial one, however, so far most of the efforts have been academic studies. A P2P MMOG may potentially be more scalable and cheaper to build, but notable issues with P2P MMOGs include security and consistency control, which can be difficult to address given that clients are easily hacked. Some MMOGs such as &quot;Vindictus&quot; use P2P networking and client-server networking together.

In April 2004, the United States Army announced that it was developing a massively multiplayer training simulation called &quot;AWE&quot; (asymmetric warfare environment). The purpose of &quot;AWE&quot; is to train soldiers for urban warfare and there are no plans for a public commercial release. Forterra Systems is developing it for the Army based on the &quot;There&quot; engine.

In 2010, Bonnie Nardi published an ethnographic study on &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; examined with Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s activity theory.

As the field of MMOs grows larger each year, research has also begun to investigate the socio-informatic bind the games create for their users. In 2006, researchers Constance A. Steinkuehler and Dmitri Williams initiated research on such topics. The topic most intriguing to the pair was to further understand the gameplay, as well as the virtual world serving as a social meeting place, of popular MMOs.

To further explore the effects of social capital and social relationships on MMOs, Steinkuehler and Williams combined conclusions from two different MMO research projects: sociocultural perspective on culture and cognition, and the other on media effects of MMOs. The conclusions of the two studies explained how MMOs function as a new form of a &quot;third place&quot; for informal social interactions much like coffee shops, pubs, and other typical hangouts. Many scholars, however, such as Oldenburg (1999), challenge the idea of a MMOs serving as a &quot;third place&quot; due to inadequate bridging social capital. His argument is challenged by Putnam (2000) who concluded that MMOs are well suited for the formation of bridging social capital, tentative relationships that lack in depth, because it is inclusive and serves as a sociological lubricant that is shown across the data collected in both of the research studies.

MMOs can also move past the &quot;lubricant&quot; stage and into the &quot;superglue&quot; stage known as bonding social capital, a closer relationship that is characterized by stronger connections and emotional support. The study concludes that MMOs function best as a bridging mechanism rather than a bonding one, similar to a &quot;third place&quot;. Therefore, MMOs have the capacity and the ability to serve as a community that effectively socializes users just like a coffee shop or pub, but conveniently in the comfort of their home.

==Spending==
British online gamers are outspending their German and French counterparts according to a study commissioned by Gamesindustry.com and TNS. The UK MMO-market is now worth £195 million in 2009 compared to the £165 million and £145 million spent by German and French online gamers.

The US gamers spend more, however, spending about $3.8 billion overall on MMO games. $1.8 billion of that money is spent on monthly subscription fees. The money spent averages out to $15.10 between both subscription and free-to-play MMO gamers. The study also found that 46% of 46 million players in the US pay real money to play MMO games.

&quot;Today&#x27;s Gamers MMO Focus Report&quot;, published in March 2010, was commissioned by TNS and gamesindustry.com. A similar study for the UK market-only (&quot;UK National Gamers Survey Report&quot;) was released in February 2010 by the same groups.

<text>The Environment Agency (EA) is a non-departmental public body, established in 1996 and sponsored by the United Kingdom government&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, with responsibilities relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England (and until 2013 also Wales).

Based in Bristol, the Environment Agency is responsible for flood management, waste management, regulating land and water pollution, and conservation.

==Roles and responsibilities==

===Purpose===

The Environment Agency&#x27;s stated purpose is, &quot;to protect or enhance the environment, taken as a whole&quot; so as to promote &quot;the objective of achieving sustainable development&quot; (taken from the Environment Act 1995, section 4). Protection of the environment relates to threats such as flood and pollution. The vision of the agency is of &quot;a rich, healthy and diverse environment for present and future generations&quot;.

===Scope===
The Environment Agency&#x27;s remit covers almost the whole of England, about 13 million hectares of land, of river and of coastline seawards to the three-mile limit which includes 2 million hectares of coastal waters. In a sharing arrangement with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), it also exercises some of its functions over parts of the catchments of the River Tweed and the Border Esk which are, for the most part, in Scotland. Similarly, in an arrangement with NRW, political and operational areas are not coterminus. NRW staff exercise responsibility for parts of the River Dee in England and EA staff exercise operational responsibility for those parts of the River Severn catchment in Wales.

===Structure===
The Environment Agency employs around 10,600 staff. It is organised into eight directorates that report to the chief executive.

There are two &quot;policy and process&quot; directorates. One deals with Flood and Coastal Risk Management and the other with Environment and Business. These are backed up by the Evidence directorate. The fourth directorate is a single Operations &quot;delivery&quot; unit, responsible for national services, and line management of all the regional and area staff.

The remaining directorates are central shared service groups for Finance, Legal Services, Resources and Communications.

In support of its aims, the agency acts as an operating authority, a regulatory authority and a licence authority.

===Finance===
The agency is funded in part from the UK government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Additional money is raised from the issuing of licences and permits such as abstraction licences, waste handler registrations, navigation rights and rod (fishing) licences.

Funding for asset management and improvement and acquisition of flood risk management assets has traditionally come from local authorities via flood defence committees. This was then effectively repaid by central government in later years as part of the Formula Spending Share. In 2005 this was simplified by making a direct transfer from Treasury to the Environment Agency in the form of flood defence grant-in-aid.

The Environment Agency&#x27;s total funding in 2007–08 was £1,025 million, an increase of £23 million on 2006–07. Of that total, £629 million (61 per cent) was provided in the form of &#x27;flood defence grant-in-aid&#x27; from government (£578 million for England and £50 million for Wales). In addition, £347 million (34 per cent) was raised through statutory charging schemes and flood defence levies; and a further £50 million (5 per cent) came from other miscellaneous sources.

In 2007–08 had an operational budget of £1.025 billion, of which £628m was grant from the agency&#x27;s sponsoring government departments. Approximately half the agency&#x27;s expenditure is on flood risk management, and a third is spent on environment protection (pollution control). Of the remainder, 12% goes to water resources, and 6% to other water functions including navigation and wildlife.

===Overall governance===
The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has the lead sponsorship responsibility for the Environment Agency as a whole and is responsible for the appointment of the chairman and the Environment Agency board.

In addition the Secretary of State is responsible for overall policy on the environment and sustainable development within which the agency undertakes its work; the setting of objectives for the agency&#x27;s functions and its contribution to sustainable development; the approval of its budget and payment of government grant to the agency for its activities in England and approval of its regulatory and charging regimes. Its chief executive is Sir James Bevan.

Sir Philip Dilley resigned as chairman on 11 January 2016, with Emma Howard Boyd becoming acting chair. Emma Howard Boyd took up the post of chair formally on 19 September 2016.

==History==
The Environment Agency was created by the Environment Act 1995, and came into existence on 1 April 1996. It had responsibility for the whole of England and Wales but with specifically designated border arrangements with Scotland covering the catchment of the River Tweed. It took over the roles and responsibilities of the National Rivers Authority (NRA), Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) and the waste regulation authorities in England and Wales including the London Waste Regulation Authority (LWRA). All of the predecessor bodies were disbanded and the local authorities relinquished their waste regulatory role. At the same time, the agency took responsibility for issuing flood warnings to the public, a role previously held by the police.

In 2010 a new national headquarters for the agency was opened at Horizon House in Deanery Road, Bristol. The building, which was designed by Alec French Architects, received Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment (BREEAM) certification for its environmentally friendly construction and operation which includes the use of sustainable materials, natural ventilation and cooling, photoelectric panels and rainwater harvesting.

On 24 April 2013, Horizon House suffered a fire leading to its closure for several weeks. An investigation into the fire found it was that result of workmen accidentally igniting the environmentally friendly cavity wall insulation on the ground floor and due to the design of the upward airflow the fire spread quickly in the inside of the wall leading to substantial smoke damage throughout. The building was quickly evacuated and the fire under control in under an hour. The resulting internal document proposed additional standards for the handling of materials that offer environmental advantages but may be considered more susceptible to ignition.

On 1 April 2013, that part of the Environment Agency covering Wales was merged into Natural Resources Wales, a separate body managing the Welsh environment and natural resources.

==Flood and coastal risk management==
The Environment Agency is the principal flood risk management operating authority. It has the power (but not the legal obligation) to manage flood risk from designated main rivers and the sea. These functions in relation to other rivers (defined as ordinary watercourses) in England are undertaken by local authorities or internal drainage boards. The Environment Agency is also responsible for increasing public awareness of flood risk, flood forecasting and warning and has a general supervisory duty for flood risk management. the Environment Agency also has a strategic overview role for all flood and coastal erosion risk management. The term &quot;Flood Risk Management&quot; in place of &quot;Flood Defence&quot; recognises that managed flooding is essential to meet the requirements of a sustainable flood strategy. It is often not economically feasible or even desirable to prevent all forms of flooding in all locations, and so the Environment Agency uses its powers to reduce either the likelihood or consequences of flooding.

===Activities to reduce likelihood of flooding===
The Environment Agency is responsible for operating, maintaining and replacing an estimated £20 billion worth of flood risk management (FRM) installations. According to a report by consultants in 2001, these are estimated to prevent annual average damage costs of approximately £3.5 billion. The agency also invests in improving or providing new installations in areas where there remains a high risk of flooding, particularly where, because of the possible consequences, the damage risk is the highest. The Thames Barrier was completed long before the EA was created but more recent examples of major defences against coastal flooding include the Medmerry managed realignment scheme in West Sussex in 2013. Recent examples of major inland flood prevention schemes include the Jubilee River.

===Activities to reduce consequences of flooding===
The Environment Agency provides flood forecasting and warning systems and maintains maps of areas liable to flood, as well as preparing emergency plans and responding when an event occurs. The Environment Agency carries out an advisory function in development control – commenting on planning applications within flood risk areas, providing advice to assist planning authorities in ensuring that any development is carried out in line with the National Planning Policy Framework. The agency provides technical advice on the flood risk assessment that must be submitted with most planning applications in flood risk areas. The agency also runs public awareness campaigns to inform those at risk who may be unaware that they live in an area that is prone to flooding, as well as providing information about what the flood warning codes and symbols mean and how to respond in the event of a flood. The agency operates Floodline, a 24-hour telephone helpline on flooding. Floodline covers England, Wales and Scotland but not Northern Ireland, and provides information and advice including property flood-risk checks, flood warnings, and flood preparation advice.

In partnership with the Met Office it runs the Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) which provides warnings of flooding which may affect England and Wales. Formed in 2009, the FFC is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter.

==Environment and business==
The agency is the main regulator of discharges to air, water, and land – under the provisions of a series of Acts of Parliament. It does this through the issue of formal consents to discharge or, in the case of large, complex or potentially damaging industries by means of a permit. Failure to comply with such a consent or permit or making a discharge without the benefit of a consent can lead to criminal prosecution. A magistrates&#x27; court can impose fines of up to £50,000 or 12 months imprisonment for each offence of causing or knowingly permitting pollution. If prosecuted in the Crown Court, there is no limit on the amount of the fine and sentences of up to five years imprisonment may be imposed on those responsible for the pollution or on the directors of companies causing pollution.

The agency has an important role in conservation and ecology specifically along rivers and in wetlands. More general responsibility for the countryside and natural environment in England falls to the organisation Natural England. The Environment Agency&#x27;s activities support users of the rivers and wetlands, including anglers and boaters.

===Climate change===
The agency states that they take a &quot;leading role in limiting and preparing for the impacts of climate change.&quot;

===Air quality===
The agency is a regulator for the release of air pollutants into the atmosphere from large, complex industrial processes. This will soon include emissions from some large-scale agricultural activities, but air pollutant releases from many agricultural activities will continue to be unregulated.

Major sources of air pollution, such as transport, are subject to various measures at the European, national and local level. Local authorities regulate air pollution from smaller industrial processes. The agency works with local authorities, National Highways and others to implement the UK government&#x27;s air quality strategy in England as mandated in the Environment Act 1995. The Environment Agency has an Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (AQMAU) that aims to ensure that air quality assessments for permit applications, enforcement and air pollution incident investigations are consistent, of a high standard and based on sound science.

===Land quality===
The agency is the regulatory authority for all waste management activities including the licensing of sites such as landfill, incineration and recycling facilities. It also regulates the movement of hazardous wastes such as fibrous asbestos, infectious clinical wastes and harmful chemicals. The agency issues environmental permits to waste management sites and any individuals or companies found to have caused pollution or have infringed their licence conditions can be prosecuted. In serious cases the Environment Agency has the power to revoke the environmental permits issued to sites that contravene the conditions of their permits stopping all waste handling activities.

===Water quality===
The agency has a duty to maintain and improve the quality of surface waters and ground-waters and, as part of the duty, it monitors the quality of rivers, lakes, the sea and groundwater on a regular basis. Much of this information is required by law under the provisions of a number of European Directives to be reported both to Parliament and to be made public. Some of these duties have been in force through predecessor agencies and as a consequence the agency maintains some long term data sets which in some cases such as the harmonised monitoring scheme exceed 30 years of consistent data collection.

Monitoring is also carried out of many discharges to the aquatic environment including sewage effluents and trade and agricultural discharges.

===Water resources===
The agency manages the use and conservation of water through the issue of water abstraction licences for activities such as drinking water supply, artificial irrigation and hydro-electricity generation. The agency is in charge of inland rivers, estuaries and harbours in England. Its remit also extends into Scotland in the River Tweed and River Solway catchments where special arrangements exist with SEPA to avoid duplication but retain management on a catchment basis.

Complex arrangements exist for the management of river regulation reservoirs, which are used to store winter water in the wetter parts of England to maintain levels in the summer time so that there is sufficient water to supply the drier parts of the country with drinking water.

===Fishing===

The Environment Agency fisheries service has a statutory duty to maintain, improve and develop migratory and freshwater fisheries as set out in the Environment Act 1995. The interpretation of this is set out in Ministerial guidance as:

*To ensure the conservation and maintain the diversity of freshwater and migratory fish, and to conserve their aquatic environment;
*To enhance the contribution migratory and freshwater fisheries make to the economy, particularly in remote rural areas and in areas with low levels of income; and
*To enhance the social value of fishing as a widely available and healthy form of recreation.

The Environment Agency has the power under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 to license fishing for salmon trout, freshwater fish, eels, lamprey and smelt and to set duties for the provision of fishing licences.

Fishing licence income along with a small amount of Grant in Aid (GiA) provides the funding to deliver the statutory duty to maintain, improve and develop freshwater and migratory fisheries, including the current fisheries service provided to recreational anglers.

The EA&#x27;s funding principles mean that income from the sale of fishing licences is entirely ringfenced re-invested back into fisheries work.

Many of the societal and environmental outcomes the fisheries service currently deliver, and aspire to deliver on a greater scale, is through partnership working. Working with partners such as the Angling Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Riverfly partnership allows the EA to maximise fishing licence income through match funding to deliver against key benefits for fishing and fisheries across the country.

Income from fishing licence sales is used to fund vital work to improve and protect fish and fisheries. Income generated is invested directly back into the angling community, improving fish stocks, boosting opportunities for anglers as well as undertaking fisheries enforcement, habitat improvement and fish rescues when needed. 
It is not used to fund wider water quality investigations or enforcement action. This is funded directly by government.

===Navigation===

After the Canal &amp; River Trust, the Environment Agency is the second largest navigation authority in the United Kingdom managing navigation for of England&#x27;s rivers. The Agency&#x27;s lock-keepers maintain and operate systems of sluices, weirs and locks to manage water-levels for navigation, and where necessary to control flooding. Annual spending to maintain these installations, with an estimated replacement value of £700M, is around £22&amp; per annum. The agency uses the registration fees of some 31,000 craft on the waterways to provide some of the income.

The agency&#x27;s responsibilities include the non-tidal River Thames, the Medway Navigation, River Wye and River Lugg, the Royal Military Canal and the Fens and Anglian systems. The Environment Agency is organising the Fens Waterways Link a major construction project to link rivers in the Fens and Anglian Systems for navigation. The first stage is the South Forty-Foot Drain.
Functions in relation to most canals are undertaken by the Canal and River Trust.

===Other marine responsibilities===
The Environment Agency is the harbour authority for Rye and the conservancy authority for the Dee Estuary. The Environment Agency has also published information about tidal bores, these being the Trent Aegir and the Severn bore.

== Equipment and fleet ==

The EA operates a variety of equipment and machinery along with a transport fleet in order to carry out the specialised duties of its officers, namely in survey, incident response and monitoring. Due to the remit of the EA, this includes land vehicles, marine vessels and light aircraft.

=== Land ===

* Land Rover Defender
* Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV

=== Sea ===

* Sentry I, II, III (Cheetah Marine catamaran)
* Thames / Severn / Humber Guardian survey vessel

=== Air ===

* Reims-Cessna F406

== Consultation and influencing ==

The agency uses its influence and provides education to change attitudes and behaviour towards the environment. Action, in several policy areas, is directed towards business and commerce at all levels, children in education, the general public and government and local government. This last area is quite distinct from the agency&#x27;s statutory role to advise government.

In local government planning processes, the Environment Agency is a statutory consultee on all planning matters from county strategic plans down to individual planning applications. In reality only those applications judged to pose special risks to the environment are commented on in any detail. For many years the agency has been offering strong advice against the development of land in floodplains because of the risk of flooding. Whilst in some instances, this advice may not have been appreciated in its entirety, in a large number of cases this advice has been used to reach decisions on planning applications.

The Environment Agency is also an advisory board member of the River Restoration Centre at Cranfield University.

==Advice to Government==
Until the formation of the Environment Agency, the Government took specialist advice on the management of the environment from civil servants employed in appropriate ministries. This led to considerable duplication of effort and frequent disagreements between Government and the regulatory agencies. The Environment Agency now advises Government directly about those issues within its purview.

==Organisation==
The operational arm of the Environment Agency consists of 14 areas, all of which report to the Director of Operations. As of April 2014, the Environment Agency removed its regional level of administration (formerly Anglian Region, Midlands Region, North West Region, South East Region, South West Region and Yorkshire &amp; North East Region) to be replaced by an &quot;area once, national once&quot; model. The 14 area names were also changed to better reflect the areas that they serve. The new area names are:

*North 
**North East
**Cumbria and Lancashire
**Yorkshire
**Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire

*West and Central
**Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire
**East Midlands
**West Midlands
**Wessex
**Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly

*South East
**East Anglia
**Hertfordshire and North London
**Thames
**Solent and South Downs
**Kent, South London and East Sussex
==Criticism==

Since the establishment of the Environment Agency several major flood events have occurred and the Agency has been the target of criticism. A number of reports have been produced which chart various developments in flood management.

===Easter 1998 floods and Bye report===
At Easter 1998, the equivalent of one months rain fell in the Midlands in 24 hours and flooding caused £400m damage and five deaths. In the light of criticism, the Agency commissioned a report from a review team under the Chairmanship of Peter Bye, a former chief executive of Suffolk CC. The report concluded that in many respects, the Environment Agency&#x27;s policies, plans and operational arrangements were sound, and that staff did their best in extreme circumstances, but there were instances of unsatisfactory planning, inadequate warnings for the public, incomplete defences and poor co-ordination with emergency services. Specifically the report highlighted the flood warning system and said the scale of the damage could have been avoided if the agency had issued more advice to those living in the worst affected areas and noted &quot;People who do not understand what they can do to protect themselves when they are warned are not protected.&quot;

===Autumn 2000 floods and &quot;Learning to Live with Rivers&quot;===

In the Autumn 2000 floods, damage was reduced by flood defences and by timely warnings and evacuations where the defences could not hold back the water. As a result, 280,000 properties were protected from the floods, but over 10,000 properties were still flooded at an estimated cost of £1 billion. Defra commissioned an independent review by the Institution of Civil Engineers under George Fleming. The review was to consider methods of estimating and reducing flood risk and look at whether flood risk management could make more use of natural processes. Other terms of reference included the possible impact of climate change and experience of other countries. The resulting report entitled &quot;Learning to Live with Rivers&quot; specifically criticised a reluctance to use computer models and inadequate representation of the dynamic effects of land use, catchment processes and climatic variability. More broadly, the report noted that sustainable flood risk management could only be achieved by working with the natural response of the river basin and by providing the necessary storage, flow reduction and discharge capacity. It concluded that floods can only be managed, not prevented, and the community must learn to live with rivers.

===June 2007 National Audit Office report===

On 15 June 2007 the National Audit Office produced a report on the performance of the Environment Agency with respect to its administrative targets and information systems. The report highlighted that the Environment Agency had not reached its targets for maintaintaining flood defence systems and producing catchment area plans, and that since 2001 the general conditions of assets had not improved significantly. It concluded the agency could reduce the need for extra funding by improving cost effectiveness.

On the basis of the report, and to the background of the Summer 2007 floods, on 27 June 2007 the Committee of Public Accounts under Edward Leigh subjected the Environment Agency management to severe interrogation and concluded that the agency had &quot;not delivered protection for the British people&quot;. Issuing a strong response, the chief executive rejected the charge that the Environment Agency has massively failed, as alleged in the commons public accounts committee, noting that in the last seven years, defences had been created to protect 100,000 homes in floodplains, numbers receiving flood warning had dramatically increased and greatly improved flood mapping and forecasting had been implemented.

===Summer 2007 floods and the Pitt review===

Following the 2007 United Kingdom floods, which left 13 people dead, 44,600 homes flooded and caused £3bn damage, Defra announced an independent review by Sir Michael Pitt.

The Environment Agency directors attracted criticism when it emerged that shortly before the floods they had received five-figure &quot;performance bonuses&quot;, with numerous calls for the bonuses to be donated to flood relief funds. An opposition spokesperson raised a question over the timing of the release of the information—&quot;just as MPs left for their 11-week summer recess—guaranteeing minimum parliamentary scrutiny&quot;.

Pitt&#x27;s review, published in full in June 2008 contained 92 recommendations looking at all aspects of the &quot;biggest civil emergency in British history&quot;. Of these, thirteen were directed at the Environment Agency, the first of which stated that the Environment Agency should take on a national overview of all flood risk (2). It recommended the Environment Agency should further develop its modelling tools and techniques working with its partners on such (4)(5), and also make flood visualisation data more accessible (36)(37). It recommended closer working with the Met Office (6)(34)(35)(65), which lead to the opening of the Flood Forecasting Centre. The Agency should provide a more specific flood warning system for infrastructure operators (33), work with local responders to raise awareness in flood risk areas (61) and work with telecoms companies to roll out telephone flood warning schemes. Other recommendations were that the Environment Agency should continue its existing processes (8)(25).

The review also argued that the government&#x27;s £800 million-a-year flood defence budget for 2010 to 2011 was &quot;about right&quot; but stated that money should be spent more wisely. Sir Michael Pitt said: &quot;What we are arguing is that we were not well prepared last summer for the scale of flooding that took place.&quot;

After the 2007 floods, the present organisation of flood management in England and Wales, with a large number of separate bodies responsible for different components, was called into question. George Fleming, who chaired the committee which produced the &quot;Learning to Live with Rivers&quot; report argued that the Environment Agency had too many roles and faced too great a conflict between its roles as habitat protector and planning regulator and suggested it was time to break it up and create a dedicated Flood Management Agency. On leaving her post as CEO in June 2008 Barbara Young responded to these suggestions, predicting that the Pitt report was unlikely to recommend the break-up of the Environment Agency.

===Winter 2013–14 floods===

The Environment Agency and its then chair Chris Smith was involved with a row with Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and other members of the government, and landowners and residents in Somerset. The row focused on the flooding of the Somerset Levels and whether the River Parrett should be dredged.

===Winter 2015–16 floods===

The Environment Agency, responsible for main river maintenance, was criticised for failures which led to flooding following a period of heavy rainfall in December 2015 (Storm Desmond, Storm Eva) across northern England and parts of Scotland. In particular, the decision to open a barrier on the River Foss resulted in flooding of supposedly protected houses. This wasn&#x27;t a decision taken lightly however, there was a strong chance the barrier could have broken down while closed leading to a much greater risk of flooding. Additionally, the Environment Agency was accused of misleading the public by stating that its chairman Philip Dilley was &quot;at home with his family&quot; when he was at his wife&#x27;s family home in Barbados. In the days following the floods, it was reported that Agency staff responsible for protecting the UK from flooding were paid almost £300,000 in bonuses or received large payoffs in 2015, including the Environment Agency&#x27;s publicity chief who led the press team who tried to cover-up their chairman&#x27;s absence; Pam Gilder quit with a £112,000 pay-off.

The extent of damage caused in such a short period across wide areas has brought into focus the overall performance of UK central government flood defence strategies. Expensive flood defence systems were proven ineffective and in some cases appeared to increase the problem. Professor Dieter Helm, Chair of the UK government&#x27;s Natural Capital Committee stated in January 2016: &quot;Flooding crises tend to follow an established pattern. First, there is immediate help and assistance. Then second, there is a &quot;review&quot;. On occasions, this leads to a third stage of genuine reform, but in most cases &quot;sticking plasters&quot; are applied. These are incremental and often sensible, but typically fail to address the core issues and hence provide only a temporary respite. There are very good reasons why &quot;sticking plasters&quot; will not work this time. The conventional approach to flood defence, carried out by the Environment Agency (EA), and financed largely by the Treasury, is at best inefficient. Sometimes it is even counterproductive, encouraging the sorts of land use and land management decisions that can actually make flooding worse in the medium term.&quot;

The House of Commons Select Committee for the Environment challenged the Chief Executive Officer of the Environment Agency on its performance by stating: &quot;You [Sir James Bevan, CEO] said &quot;The capacity of a river doesn&#x27;t matter!&quot; You&#x27;ve got to be certain the leopard has changed its spots. And I will keep repeating this. You haven&#x27;t really given us an answer as to whether you have monitored the situation. I&#x27;m fearful. You allowed the River Parrett [Somerset] to silt up, you allowed the Tone to silt up, you allowed the tributaries to silt up, and then it flooded.&quot; The Committee added: &quot;The EA don&#x27;t provide [quotes for work] when doing projects so we can&#x27;t compare like with like [with other project providers]. There is an argument for transparency on your spending... You say the right words and hold onto your power.&quot;

Sir Philip Dilley resigned as chairman of the Environment Agency on 11 January 2016. Dilley stated he was stepping down because &quot;expectations&quot; of his role have changed to mean he has to be &quot;available at short notice throughout the year&quot;.

<text>Phimai () is a township (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) in Nakhon Ratchasima Province in northeast Thailand. As of 2005 the town had a population of 9,768. The town is the administrative center of the Phimai District.

In the aftermath of the fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767, attempts were made to set up five separate states, with Prince Teppipit, a son of king Boromakot, attempting to establish Phimai as one, holding sway over eastern provinces including Nakhon Ratchasima. The weakest of the five, Prince Teppipit was the first defeated and was executed in 1768. Phimai had also been an important town at the time of the Khmer empire.

The region was integrated into the Khmer state around 1000 CE. For the following 300 years, Phimai was a major regional administrative center. The temple Prasat Hin Phimai, in the center of the town, was one of the major Khmer temples in what is now Thailand, connected with Angkor by the Khmer highway, and oriented so as to face Angkor as its cardinal direction. The site is now protected as the Phimai Historical Park.

Phimai has recently been the base of operations for the excavation of Ban Non Wat.

==Korat cat==
Phimai is thought to be the place where the famed Korat cat breed originated.

<text>Jeffrey Daryl Friesen (born August 5, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played over 800 games in the National Hockey League, spending roughly half his career with the San Jose Sharks, who drafted him in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. The rest of his career was spent with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, New Jersey Devils, Washington Capitals, and Calgary Flames. He won the Stanley Cup with the Devils in 2003.

==Playing career==
Friesen played his junior years with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL) where he was Rookie of the Year in 1993. He was selected 11th overall in the first round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks. He played 14 season in the NHL as a winger, originally as a left winger but also as a right winger.

Friesen played nearly seven seasons with the Sharks, becoming their 3rd all-time leading scorer, but was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim near the end of the 2000–01 season. After playing the following season with the Ducks, he was traded to the New Jersey Devils for the 2002–03 season where he won the Stanley Cup. In the Eastern Conference Finals against the Ottawa Senators that year, Friesen scored the game-winning goal with just under three minutes left in regulation in Game 7. It was his third game-winning goal of the series. Then in Game 7 of the finals, he scored two goals against his former team, the Ducks en route to the Devils&#x27; third Stanley Cup championship.

On September 26, 2005, the salary cap-troubled Devils traded Friesen to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a conditional 2006 draft pick. On March 9, 2006, he was moved again to the Ducks for a second-round draft pick, but spent a significant part of the 2005–06 season sidelined with a groin injury.

Friesen was signed by the Calgary Flames on July 5, 2006 to a 1-year $1.6 million contract for the 2006–07 season. After a disappointing season that had Friesen producing six goals and six assists in seventy-two games, the Calgary Flames chose not to re-sign him. He played in the AHL as a left wing for the Lake Erie Monsters before January 29, 2008, when Friesen was released.

Friesen attended the San Jose Sharks&#x27; 2008 training camp on a tryout basis. On October 9, 2008, Sharks Executive Vice President and General Manager Doug Wilson announced that Friesen had been released from training camp. On August 29, 2009, Friesen signed a one-year contract with the Eisbären Berlin of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).

Friesen is tied with Jamie Baker for the Sharks single-season short-handed goals record with 6, set in the 1997–98 season. On February 21, 2015 he returned to San Jose (Santa Clara) where he was introduced along with several other former Shark players before the outdoor Stadium Series game vs. the L.A. Kings at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara.

==Personal life==
Friesen and his ex-wife Rhonda have a daughter and son together.

<text>A nonvolatile acid (also known as a fixed acid or metabolic acid) is an acid produced in the body from sources other than carbon dioxide, and is not excreted by the lungs. They can be produced from an incomplete metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. All acids produced in the body are nonvolatile except carbonic acid, which is the sole volatile acid. Common nonvolatile acids in humans are lactic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid. Humans produce about 1–1.5 mmoles of H+ per kilogram per day. Most nonvolatile acids are excreted by the kidneys. Lactic acid is usually completely metabolized by the body, and is thus not excreted from the body.

==Reactions==
The following reactions result in nonvolatile acids:

* sulfur-containing amino acid oxidations:
*:e.g. methionine or cysteine → urea + CO2 + H2SO4 → 2H+ + 
* phosphorus-containing compound metabolism → H3PO4 → H+ + 
* cationic amino acid oxidation:
*: e.g. lysine or arginine → urea + CO2 + H2O + H+
* Non-metabolizable organic acid production:
*: HA → H+ + A−
* Incomplete metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins → e.g. lactic acid or keto-acids

<text>Gavrilov-Yam () is a town and the administrative center of Gavrilov-Yamsky (or Gavrilov-Yamskiy) District in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, located on the Kotorosl River. Population: 

==History==

The first mention of a settlement on the site of modern Gavrilov-Yam dates back to 1545. Then it was a small village of Gavrilovo, in which there were only 7 courtyards and it belonged to the Varnitsky Trinity-Sergius Monastery.

At the end of the 16th century, by decree of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, the village was renamed into Gavrilov Yam, later into Gavrilov-Yamskaya Sloboda, and at the end of the 18th century, in connection with the construction of a stone church - and into the village of Gavrilov-Yam. Town status was granted in 1938.

In the early 2000s, the weaving production of the Moscow-based factory, Trekhgornaya Manufactory, was transferred to the oblast to which the town belongs.

The Gavrilov-Yamskiy Flax Mill traces its history back to the Lokalov textile factory. The mill carries out all stages of flax processing, from flax-combed production to finished products (linen and mixed fabrics, patterned tablecloths, napkins, towels, etc.). The plant is the only one in the country that produces art canvas.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Gavrilov-Yam serves as the administrative center of the Gavrilov-Yamsky (or Gavrilov-Yamskiy) District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Gavrilov-Yamsky (or Gavrilov-Yamskiy) District as the town of district significance of Gavrilov-Yam. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Gavrilov-Yam is incorporated within Gavrilov-Yamsky (Gavrilov-Yamskiy) Municipal District as Gavrilov-Yam Urban Settlement.

After the war, he served as a representative in the North Carolina General Assembly and served three terms in U.S. representative from the 5th Congressional District in North Carolina.

==Early life==
He was born at &quot;Blount Hall&quot; on May 10, 1759, in Craven County (in the portion of it which became Pitt County in 1760) in the Province of North Carolina. His parents were Jacob Blount of Beaufort County, North Carolina and Barbara Gray Blount. Jacob Blount acquired an estate of six thousand acres on Contentnea Creek between 1757 and 1783. Thomas had six siblings: William (b. 26 March 1749), Ann (b. 3 October 1750), John Gray (b. 21 September 1752), Louisa (b. 17 January 1755), Reading (b. 22 February 1757), and Jacob (b. 5 November 1760). Thomas&#x27;s mother died in 1763 and his father remarried to Hannah Salter Baker. Thomas was educated at home. He was close to his brothers William and John Gray in both business and politics.

John Gray and William were representatives in the North Carolina General Assembly.

==Career==

=== Military service ===
In 1777 at the age of 16, Blount entered the Continental Army&#x27;s 5th North Carolina Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. He served as a lieutenant under Captain Benjamin Stedman. He was dropped from the rolls in January 1778, since he was captured during the conflicts (most likely the Battle of Germantown). He was among those prisoners of war shipped to England for detention. In 1780, he was back in North Carolina and served as Adjutant General to Major General Richard Caswell in the North Carolina militia.

=== Political career ===
He served as the representative for North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1793 to 1799, and the 3rd congressional district from 1805 to 1809 and 1811 to his death in 1812. He was also a U.S. Senate candidate in 1792, and an unsuccessful congressional candidate in 1802.

==Personal life==
He was the brother of William Blount and John Gray Blount and the uncle of William Grainger Blount. His wife, Mary J. Sumner, was the daughter of Jethro Sumner.

His home at Tarboro, The Grove, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

<text>Dissociation is a concept that has been developed over time and which concerns a wide array of experiences, ranging from a mild emotional detachment from the immediate surroundings, to a more severe disconnection from physical and emotional experiences. The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment from reality, rather than a false perception of reality as in psychosis.

The phenomena are diagnosable under the &quot;DSM-5&quot; as a group of disorders as well as a symptom of other disorders through various diagnostic tools. Its cause is believed to be related to neurobiological mechanisms, trauma, anxiety, and psychoactive drugs. Research has further related it to suggestibility and hypnosis. 

== History ==
French philosopher and psychologist Pierre Janet (1859–1947) is considered to be the author of the concept of dissociation. Unlike some conceptions of dissociation, Janet did not believe that dissociation was a psychological defense.

Janet claimed that dissociation occurred only in persons who had a constitutional weakness of mental functioning that led to hysteria when they were stressed. Although it is true that many of Janet&#x27;s case histories described traumatic experiences, he never considered dissociation to be a defense against those experiences. He considered trauma to be one of many stressors that could worsen the already-impaired &quot;mental deficiency&quot; of a hysteric, thereby generating a cascade of hysterical (in today&#x27;s language, &quot;dissociative&quot;) symptoms.

Although there was great interest in dissociation during the last two decades of the nineteenth century (especially in France and England), this interest rapidly waned with the coming of the new century. Janet largely turned his attention to other matters. There was a sharp peak in interest in dissociation in America from 1890 to 1910, especially in Boston as reflected in the work of William James, Boris Sidis, Morton Prince, and William McDougall. In America, interest in dissociation rapidly succumbed to the surging academic interest in unscientific psychoanalysis and behaviorism.

For most of the twentieth century, there was little interest in dissociation. Despite this, a review of 76 previously published cases from the 1790s to 1942 was published in 1944, describing clinical phenomena consistent with that seen by Janet and by therapists today. In 1971, Bowers and her colleagues presented a detailed, and still quite valid, treatment article. The authors of this article included leading thinkers of their time – John G. Watkins (who developed ego-state therapy) and Zygmunt A. Piotrowski (famed for his work on the Rorschach test). Further interest in dissociation was evoked when Ernest Hilgard (1977) published his neodissociation theory in the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s an increasing number of clinicians and researchers wrote about dissociation, particularly multiple personality disorder.

Attention to dissociation as a clinical feature has been growing in recent years as knowledge of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased, due to interest in dissociative identity disorder (DID), and as neuroimaging research and population studies show its relevance.

== Psychopathological ==
Historically the psychopathological concept of dissociation has also another different root: the conceptualization of Eugen Bleuler that looks into dissociation related to schizophrenia.

== Diagnosis ==

Dissociation is commonly displayed on a continuum. In mild cases, dissociation can be regarded as a coping mechanism or defense mechanism in seeking to master, minimize or tolerate stress – including boredom or conflict. At the non-pathological end of the continuum, dissociation describes common events such as daydreaming. Further along the continuum are non-pathological altered states of consciousness.

More pathological dissociation involves dissociative disorders, including dissociative fugue and depersonalization derealization disorder with or without alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that self or the world is unreal or altered (depersonalization and derealization), a loss of memory (amnesia), forgetting identity or assuming a new self (fugue), and separate streams of consciousness, identity and self (dissociative identity disorder, formerly termed multiple personality disorder) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Although some dissociative disruptions involve amnesia, other dissociative events do not.

Dissociative disorders are sometimes triggered by trauma, but may be preceded only by stress, psychoactive substances, or no identifiable trigger at all. The ICD-10 classifies conversion disorder as a dissociative disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders groups all dissociative disorders into a single category and recognizes dissociation as a symptom of acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder.

Misdiagnosis is common among people who display symptoms of dissociative disorders, with an average of seven years to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. Research is ongoing into etiologies, symptomology, and valid and reliable diagnostic tools. In the general population, dissociative experiences that are not clinically significant are highly prevalent with 60% to 65% of the respondents indicating that they have had some dissociative experiences.

=== Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ===
Diagnoses listed under the &quot;DSM-5&quot; are dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, other specified dissociative disorder and unspecified dissociative disorder. The list of available dissociative disorders listed in the &quot;DSM-5&quot; changed from the &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot;, as the authors removed the diagnosis of dissociative fugue, classifying it instead as a subtype of dissociative amnesia. Furthermore, the authors recognized derealization on the same diagnostic level of depersonalization with the opportunity of differentiating between the two.

The &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot; considers symptoms such as depersonalization, derealization and psychogenic amnesia to be core features of dissociative disorders. The DSM-5 carried these symptoms over and described symptoms as positive and negative. Positive symptoms include unwanted intrusions that alter continuity of subjective experiences, which account for the first two symptoms listed earlier with the addition of fragmentation of identity. Negative symptoms include loss of access to information and mental functions that are normally readily accessible, which describes amnesia.

=== Peritraumatic dissociation ===
Peritraumatic dissociation is considered to be dissociation that is experienced during and immediately following a traumatic event. Some of the symptoms include but are not limited to depersonalization, derealization, dissociative amnesia, out-of-body experiences, emotional numbness, and altered time perception. This specific disorder has been related to self preservation and the body&#x27;s natural instinct to protect itself. Research is on-going related to its development, its importance, and its relationship to trauma, dissociative disorders, and predicting the development of PTSD.

=== Measurements ===
Two of the most commonly used screening tools in the community are the Dissociative Experiences Scale and the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory. Meanwhile, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV – Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) and its second iteration, the SCID-D-R, are both semi-structured interviews and are considered psychometrically strong diagnostic tools.

Other tools include the Office Mental Status Examination (OMSE), which is used clinically due to inherent subjectivity and lack of quantitative use. There is also the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS), which lacks substantive clarity for differential diagnostics.

Peritraumatic dissociation is measured through the Peritraumatic Dissociative Scale.

== Etiology ==

=== Neurobiological mechanism ===
Preliminary research suggests that dissociation-inducing events, drugs like ketamine, and seizures generate slow rhythmic activity (1–3 Hz) in layer 5 neurons of the posteromedial cortex in humans (retrosplenial cortex in mice). These slow oscillations disconnect other brain regions from interacting with the posteromedial cortex, which may explain the overall experience of dissociation.

===Trauma===
Dissociation has been described as one of a constellation of symptoms experienced by some victims of multiple forms of childhood trauma, including physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. This is supported by studies which suggest that dissociation is correlated with a history of trauma.

Dissociation appears to have a high specificity and a low sensitivity to having a self-reported history of trauma, which means that dissociation is much more common among those who are traumatized, yet at the same time there are many people who have suffered from trauma but who do not show dissociative symptoms.

Adult dissociation when combined with a history of child abuse and otherwise interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder has been shown to contribute to disturbances in parenting behavior, such as exposure of young children to violent media. Such behavior may contribute to cycles of familial violence and trauma.

Symptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include depersonalization, psychological numbing, disengagement, or amnesia regarding the events of the abuse. It has been hypothesized that dissociation may provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe trauma; however, in the long term, dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment.

Other symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as &quot;sequelae to abuse&quot;) include anxiety, PTSD, low self-esteem, somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-harm and suicidal ideation or actions. These symptoms may lead the victim to present the symptoms as the source of the problem.

Child abuse, especially chronic abuse starting at early ages, has been related to high levels of dissociative symptoms in a clinical sample, including amnesia for abuse memories. It has also been seen that girls who suffered abuse during their childhood had higher reported dissociation scores than boys who reported similar abuse during their childhood. A non-clinical sample of adult women linked increased levels of dissociation to sexual abuse by a significantly older person prior to age 15, and dissociation has also been correlated with a history of childhood physical and sexual abuse. When sexual abuse is examined, the levels of dissociation were found to increase along with the severity of the abuse.

=== Psychoactive substances ===

Psychoactive drugs can often induce a state of temporary dissociation. Substances with dissociative properties include ketamine, nitrous oxide, alcohol, tiletamine, amphetamine, dextromethorphan, MK-801, PCP, methoxetamine, salvia, muscimol, atropine, ibogaine, and minocycline.

Psychoactive substances that cause temporary dissociation tend to be NMDA receptor antagonists or κ-opioid receptor agonists. Although, this is not necessarily always the case and dissociation can occur with non-hallucinogenic drugs.

== Correlations ==

=== Hypnosis and suggestibility ===
There is evidence to suggest that dissociation is correlated with hypnotic suggestibility, specifically with dissociative symptoms related to trauma. However, the relationship between dissociation and hypnotic suggestibility appears to be complex and indicates further research is necessary.

Aspects of hypnosis include absorption, dissociation, suggestibility, and willingness to receive behavioral instruction from others. Both hypnotic suggestibility and dissociation tend to be less mindful, and hypnosis is used as a treatment modality for dissociation, anxiety, chronic pain, trauma, and more. Difference between hypnosis and dissociation: one is suggested, imposed by self or other, meaning dissociation is generally more spontaneous altering of awareness.

== Treatment ==
When receiving treatment, patients are assessed to discover their level of functioning. Some patients might be higher functioning than others. This is taken into account when creating a patient&#x27;s potential treatment targets. To start off treatment, time is dedicated to increasing a patient&#x27;s mental level and adaptive actions in order to gain a balance in both their mental and behavioral action. Once this is achieved, the next goal is to work on removing or minimizing the phobia made by traumatic memories, which is causing the patient to dissociate. The final step of treatment includes helping patients work through their grief in order to move forward and be able to engage in their own lives. This is done with the use of new coping skills attained through treatment. One coping skill that can improve dissociation is mindfulness due to the introduction of staying in present awareness while observing non-judgmentally and increasing the ability to regulate emotions. Specifically in adolescents, mindfulness has been shown to reduce dissociation after practicing mindfulness for three weeks.

==Psychoanalysis==
Psychoanalytical defense mechanisms belong to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of psychoanalysis is associated with the concept of psychoanalytical defense mechanisms. According to the Freudian theory, defense mechanisms are psychological strategies that are unconsciously used to protect a person from anxiety arising from unacceptable thoughts or feelings. Freud and his daughter Anna Freud developed and elaborated on these ideas.

A 2012 review article supports the hypothesis that current or recent trauma may affect an individual&#x27;s assessment of the more distant past, changing the experience of the past and resulting in dissociative states.

===Jung===
Carl Jung described pathological manifestations of dissociation as special or extreme cases of the normal operation of the psyche. This structural dissociation, opposing tension, and hierarchy of basic attitudes and functions in normal individual consciousness is the basis of Jung&#x27;s &quot;Psychological Types&quot;. He theorized that dissociation is a natural necessity for consciousness as well—he suggested that dissociation, the process where the mind disconnects from certain thoughts or memories, is a natural part of how consciousness works. Carl Jung&#x27;s theory suggests that dissociation, which is often seen as a pathological or abnormal process, is actually a natural and necessary aspect of consciousness. This ability to dissociate allows the mind to develop and evolve by creating distinct parts of the self. This concept is a key part of Jung&#x27;s Psychological Types.

<text>Jesse Marvin Unruh (, ; September 30, 1922 – August 4, 1987), also known as Big Daddy Unruh, was an American politician who served as speaker of the California State Assembly and as the California State Treasurer.

==Early life and education==
Born September 30, 1922 in Newton, Kansas, Unruh served in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and journalism in 1948.

==Career==

=== California Assembly ===

Unruh&#x27;s political career began as an unsuccessful candidate for the California State Assembly in 1950 and 1952. He was elected as a member of the Assembly on his third attempt in 1954. In 1956, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Presidential elector for California as a Democrat. In 1959, he wrote California&#x27;s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination by businesses that offer services to the public and was a model for later reforms enacted nationally in the 1960s and 1970s. Unruh was Speaker of the California State Assembly from 1961 to 1969 and a delegate to Democratic National Convention from California in 1960 and 1968.

=== Campaign work ===
As a national official of the Democratic Party, he often feuded with Governor of California Pat Brown (1959–1967), a fellow Democrat, and was a case-study of James Q. Wilson&#x27;s treatise on machine politics, &quot;The Amateur Democrat&quot;.

Unruh was California campaign manager for John F. Kennedy in 1960 and a close Kennedy associate throughout his presidency. He helped convince Senator Robert F. Kennedy to enter the 1968 presidential race and managed his California campaign. Kennedy won the California primary, but was assassinated shortly after his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.

U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once described Unruh as &quot;probably one of the most selfish men&quot; he had met in politics.

After an unsuccessful effort, managed by Unruh and Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, to draft Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Unruh released California delegates to vote their conscience and announced that he would support Eugene McCarthy at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Unruh left the legislature to campaign unsuccessfully for governor against Ronald Reagan in 1970. One of his campaign workers was Timothy Kraft, who a decade later was the campaign manager for the unsuccessful reelection bid of President Jimmy Carter. In 1973, Unruh ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Los Angeles.

=== California Treasurer ===
When he campaigned for state treasurer in 1974, the post was considered insignificant. Unruh&#x27;s radio advertisements assured voters, &quot;Make no mistake about it, I really want this job.&quot; Once elected, Unruh politicized the office. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted he became &quot;the most politically powerful public finance officer outside the U.S. Treasury&quot;. California pension funds were a major source of revenue for Wall Street underwriting companies, and Unruh secured campaign contributions in exchange for doing business with them. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he had gained control of &quot;an obscure post whose duties had long emphasized bookkeeping. In characteristic fashion, he soon transformed the job into a source of financial and political power that reached from California to Wall Street.&quot; Because as Treasurer he was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of many California boards and commissions, Unruh supervised &quot;the raising and expenditure of virtually all the state&#x27;s money and consolidated his influence over billions of dollars in public investments and pension funds&quot;.

He served as state treasurer from 1975 until his death from prostate cancer on August 4, 1987, 8 months into his 4th term as treasurer. Unruh remains the second longest-serving California State Treasurer behind only Charles G. Johnson (who served 33 years between 1923 and 1956).

The University of Southern California Department of Political Science includes the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.

==Personal life==
Unruh&#x27;s nickname &quot;Big Daddy&quot; apparently derives from a character in the Tennessee Williams play, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. Former Senate President pro Tempore Jim Mills in his book &quot;A Disorderly House&quot; insists it was given to Unruh by then-Assemblyman Don Allen.

Unruh was a Protestant and belonged to the American Legion. He married twice, and had five children.

He died of prostate cancer at his home in Marina Del Rey, California on August 4, 1987. He is buried in Santa Monica, California.

==Legacy==
The California State Treasurer&#x27;s Building was rededicated and renamed the Jesse M. Unruh State Office Building by Gov. George Deukmejian on August 19, 1987.

The California State Capitol building&#x27;s hearing room #4202 currently holds a picture of Jesse M. Unruh.

The California State Assembly Fellowship Program was renamed the Jesse Marvin Unruh Assembly Fellowship Program to honor the former Assembly Speaker and State Treasurer.

==Quotes==
:On campaign contributions: &quot;Money is the mother&#x27;s milk of politics.&quot; 1966
:On lobbyists: &quot;If you can&#x27;t eat their food, drink their booze, screw their women and then vote against them you&#x27;ve got no business being up here.&quot; Other versions exist, for instance &quot;If you can&#x27;t eat their food, drink their booze, screw their women, take their money and then vote against them, you have no business being up here.&quot;
