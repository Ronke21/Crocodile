<text>Glory is a 1989 American epic historical war drama film directed by Edward Zwick about the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the Union Army&#x27;s earliest African American regiments in the American Civil War. It stars Matthew Broderick as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the regiment&#x27;s commanding officer, and Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman as fictional members of the 54th. The screenplay by Kevin Jarre was based on the books &quot;Lay This Laurel&quot; (1973) by Lincoln Kirstein and &quot;One Gallant Rush&quot; (1965) by Peter Burchard and the personal letters of Shaw. The film depicts the soldiers of the 54th from the formation of their regiment to their heroic actions at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner.

&quot;Glory&quot; was co-produced by TriStar Pictures and Freddie Fields Productions, and distributed by Tri-Star Pictures in the United States. It premiered in limited release in the United States on December 15, 1989, and in wide release on February 16, 1990, grossing $27 million worldwide on an $18 million budget. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won three, including Best Supporting Actor for Washington. It also won awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the Golden Globe Awards, the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, the Political Film Society, and the NAACP Image Awards.

==Plot==
During the American Civil War, Captain Robert Shaw, injured at Antietam, is sent home to Boston on medical leave. Shaw accepts a promotion to Colonel commanding the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first black regiments in the Union Army. He asks his friend, Cabot Forbes, to serve as his second in command, with the rank of major. Their first volunteer is another friend, Thomas Searles, a bookish, free African-American. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Trip, and a mute teenage drummer boy.

The men learn that, in response to the Emancipation Proclamation, the Confederacy has issued an order that all black soldiers will be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found in a Union uniform will be executed as well as their white officers. They are offered, but turn down, a chance to take an honorable discharge. They undergo rigorous training with Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, to prepare them for the challenges they will face.

Trip goes AWOL and is caught, Shaw orders him flogged in front of the troops. He learns that Trip left to find shoes to replace his worn ones; his men are being denied supplies. He confronts the base&#x27;s racist quartermaster on their behalf. Shaw also supports them in a pay dispute, as the Federal government pays black soldiers $10 rather than the $13 per month white soldiers earn. Trip encourages the men to go without pay in protest; Shaw tears up his own pay stub in solidarity. In recognition of his leadership, Shaw promotes Rawlins to the rank of Sergeant-Major.

Once the 54th completes its training, they are transferred under the command of General Charles Harker. On the way to South Carolina they are ordered by Colonel James Montgomery to sack and burn Darien, Georgia. Shaw initially refuses to obey an unlawful order, but agrees under threat of having his troops taken away. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his men to join the fight, as their duties to date have involved manual labor for which they are being mocked. Shaw then finally gets the 54th into combat after he blackmails Harker and Montgomery by threatening to report the illegal activities he has discovered. In their first battle at James Island, South Carolina, early success is followed by a confrontation with many casualties. The Confederates are defeated and retreat. During the battle, Thomas is wounded but saves Trip. Shaw offers Trip the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines not believing the war will result in a better life for slaves.

General George Strong informs Shaw of a major campaign to secure a foothold at Charleston Harbor. This involves assaulting Morris Island and capturing Fort Wagner, whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the charge. The night before the battle the black soldiers conduct a religious service, and several make emotional speeches to inspire the troops, and to ask for God&#x27;s help. On their way to the attack, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.

The 54th leads the charge on the fort suffering heavy casualties. At night the bombardment continues, forestalling progress. Attempting to encourage his men, Shaw is killed. Trip lifts the flag rallying the soldiers to continue the charge. He is shot but holds up the flag until he dies. Forbes takes charge, and the soldiers are able to break through the fort&#x27;s outer defenses. Outnumbered, Charlie Morse is killed and Thomas is wounded. At the end of the battle it is implied that Forbes, Rawlins, Thomas, and Jupiter are killed by canister shot. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with bodies of Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The corpses are buried in a mass grave, with Shaw and Trip&#x27;s bodies next to each other.

Closing text reveals Fort Wagner was never taken by the Union Army. The courage demonstrated by the 54th resulted in the Union accepting thousands of black men for combat, which President Abraham Lincoln credited with helping to turn the tide of the war.

==Production==
===Development and script===

The title of the film recalls the &quot;glory&quot; for which the July 28, 1863, edition of the weekly &quot;Columbus Enquirer&quot; reported that First-Sergeant Robert John Simmons, mortally wounded at Battery Wagner, came to fight (Simmons himself wrote, in an account of the Battle of Grimball&#x27;s Landing that was published in the New York Tribune on December 23, 1863: &quot;God has protected me through this, my first fiery, leaden trial, and I do give Him the glory&quot;).

Lincoln Kirstein had first approached Lloyd Fonvielle to write the script. Fonvielle was too in awe of Kirstein to collaborate effectively with him and introduced Kirstein to his friend, Kevin Jarre, who had worked on &quot;&quot;; they were originally going to write the script together, but Fonvielle got tied up in another project, leaving Jarre to write the script on his own.

A Civil War buff since he was a child, Jarre met with Kirstein and talked about the 54th. As Jarre stated: &quot;Lincoln’s interest was deeper. It related to his whole philosophy about surrendering yourself to something bigger, some larger cause. He’d always wanted to make a movie about the 54th&quot;.

Jarre&#x27;s inspiration for writing the film came from viewing the monument to Colonel Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry in Boston Common. His screenplay was based on several sources, including the books &quot;Brave Black Regiment - History of the fifty-forth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry&quot; (1891) by the 54th&#x27;s Captain Luis F. Emilio, Lincoln Kirstein&#x27;s &quot;Lay This Laurel&quot; (1973), and Peter Burchard&#x27;s &quot;One Gallant Rush&quot; (1965), as well as the personal letters of Robert Gould Shaw.

Jarre moved into Room 421 at the Gramercy Park Hotel and worked around the clock, writing the script in a few weeks on spec.

Kirstein showed the script to producer James Ivory of Merchant Ivory Productions. Ivory liked the script but wanted Ruth Prawer Jhabvala to give it a rewrite. According to Fonvielle, Kirstein then got up, shook Ivory’s hand warmly, pulled him to his feet, said, “Jim, thanks so much for coming down,” and ushered him out the front door.

The script was then sent to director Bruce Beresford, who committed to do it and brought in producer Freddie Fields, who then set up a deal at Columbia Pictures, but when David Puttnam left Columbia, pre-production had stopped. Beresford left the project, and Fields then took the script to Tri-Star. The studio agreed to do the film and hired Edward Zwick as director.

===Filming===
Exterior filming took place primarily in Massachusetts and Georgia. The culminating battle scene of Fort Wagner was filmed on the beaches of Jekyll Island, Georgia. Opening scenes meant to portray the Battle of Antietam show volunteer military reenactors filmed at a major engagement at the Gettysburg battlefield. The scenes depicting the Battle of Grimball&#x27;s Landing were filmed at Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park. Later in the war, the 54th Massachusetts did fight at the this battle, but it is not depicted in the movie. Zwick did not want to turn &quot;Glory&quot; &quot;into a black story with a more commercially convenient white hero&quot;. Actor Morgan Freeman noted: &quot;We didn&#x27;t want this film to fall under that shadow. This is a picture about the 54th Regiment, not Colonel Shaw, but at the same time the two are inseparable&quot;. Zwick hired the writer Shelby Foote as a technical adviser. Foote later became widely known for his contributions to Ken Burns&#x27; PBS nine-episode documentary, &quot;The Civil War&quot; (1990).

On February 16, 1989, the body of a middle-aged man was discovered on the film&#x27;s set in Savannah, about a day after his death. Described as having a Middle Eastern appearance, with no apparent signs of suffering a violent death, he was never positively identified.

===Music===

&quot;Glory&quot; original motion picture soundtrack was released by Virgin Records on January 11, 1990. The score for the film was composed and orchestrated by James Horner in association with the Boys Choir of Harlem. Jim Henrikson edited the film&#x27;s music, while Shawn Murphy mixed the score.

==Historical sources==

===Monograph===
A nonfiction study of the regiment first appeared in 1965 and was republished in paperback in January 1990 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press under the title &quot;One Gallant Rush: Robert Gould Shaw and His Brave Black Regiment&quot;. The book, by Peter Burchard, expands on how the 54th Massachusetts developed as battle-ready soldiers. Summarizing the historical events, the book provides events surrounding the aftermath of the first Black Union regiment and how it influenced the outcome of the war.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95%, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Bolstered by exceptional cinematography, powerful storytelling, and an Oscar-winning performance by Denzel Washington, &quot;Glory&quot; remains one of the finest Civil War movies ever made.&quot; On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film holds a score of 78/100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Film critic Vincent Canby&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;[Broderick] gives his most mature and controlled performance to date ... [Washington is] an actor clearly on his way to a major screen career ... The movie unfolds in a succession of often brilliantly realized vignettes tracing the 54th&#x27;s organization, training and first experiences below the Mason-Dixon line. The characters&#x27; idiosyncrasies emerge&quot;. Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it &quot;a strong and valuable film no matter whose eyes it is seen through&quot;. He believed the production design credited to Norman Garwood and the cinematography of Freddie Francis paid &quot;enormous attention to period detail&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was not impressed at all with the overall acting, calling Broderick &quot;catastrophically miscast as Shaw&quot;. Alternatively, Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; described the picture by saying, &quot;the movie&#x27;s often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth&quot;. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, pointed out some flaws that included mentioning Broderick as &quot;an amiable non-presence, creating unintentionally the notion that the 54th earned their stripes despite wimpy leadership&quot;.

James Berardinelli writing for &quot;ReelViews&quot;, called the film &quot;without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War&quot;, noting that it &quot;has important things to say, yet it does so without becoming pedantic&quot;. Rating the film four stars, critic Leonard Maltin wrote that it was &quot;grand, moving, breathtakingly filmed (by veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis) and faultlessly performed&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the finest historical dramas ever made&quot;.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film a &quot;thumbs up&quot; review, saying, &quot;like &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, this is another admirable film that turns out to be surprisingly entertaining&quot;. He thought the film took on &quot;some true social significance&quot; and felt the actors portrayed the characters as &quot;more than simply black men&quot;. He explained: &quot;They&#x27;re so different, that they become not merely standard Hollywood blacks, but true individuals&quot;.

American Civil War historian James M. McPherson stated the film &quot;accomplished a remarkable feat in sensitizing a lot of today&#x27;s black students to the role that their ancestors played in the Civil War in winning their own freedom&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated and won several awards in 1989–90. A complete list of awards the film won or was nominated for are listed below.

===Retrospective response===
In 2019, on the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;Glory&quot; was re-released in over 600 theaters in the US. There were many positive reviews noting its artistic impact. One article noted &quot;the legacy of Zwick’s depiction of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment extends well beyond a 30th anniversary showcase. As a film both about the shared sacrifice of the men of the 54th and the work they left undone ... &quot;Glory&quot; is a distinctly American story—one so compelling that it has become part of the common curriculum in U.S. history classes across the nation.&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
*Aside from Shaw, none of the other members of the regiment seen in the movie are real people.
*The film portrays the 54th as having significant numbers of former slaves. In real life, the regiment was composed mostly of freedmen already living in the North, although some came from Canada and the West Indies. Many of these freed men were from prominent families, including two sons of Frederick Douglass, one of whom, Lewis, became the Sergeant Major.
*The film portrays Shaw as accepting the commission to command the 54th quickly, when in reality he initially rejected the Governor&#x27;s commission, not wanting to leave his regiment and questioning whether the position would advance his career in the army.
*Although Shaw was an abolitionist, he nevertheless expressed racist viewpoints toward Black people, repeatedly referring to them by racial slurs in his letters.
*The regiment did not struggle with being equipped properly. As a favored project of the Massachusetts governor, the regiment was provided everything it required from the outset.
*In the movie a soldier is whipped. Flogging was not permitted in the Union army and no such event ever occurred involving the USCT.
*In terms of the unequal pay, Shaw had already been informed that Black soldiers would only receive $10 while in South Carolina, and protested to his father and to the governor, not by tearing up his voucher. This issue was not resolved at the time as shown in the film, and problems arising from the unfair pay continued for the remainder of the war.
*Although not depicted in the film, Shaw married Annie Kneeland Haggerty just before the regiment departed for service in South Carolina.
*The soldiers are depicted as celebrating Christmas in the snow, however the 54th began recruitment in February 1863, and Shaw died at Fort Wagner in July 1863, meaning there was no possibility of Christmas during that period.
*In the final assault on Fort Wagner, the 54th is shown attacking southward, with the ocean on their left. In reality, they attacked northward with the ocean on their right.
*Although the post-script claims that Fort Wagner never fell to Union troops, this is inaccurate as Confederate troops abandoned the fort after bombardment and shelling from the Union Navy in September 1863.
*Although the fictional Cabot Forbes is portrayed as being Shaw&#x27;s best friend and second-in-command, the real second-in-command was Edward Hallowell, who became commander of the 54th after Shaw&#x27;s death.
*Charles Garrison Harker was ranked Major General in the film. In reality, he never attained that rank nor was involved in the campaigns around Charleston. Additionally, the real life Harker was only 25 in 1863, not in his early 40s as portrayed in the movie.

<doc id="509678" wikidata="Q11167292" url="?curid=509678" title="Repressed memory">
<text>Repressed memory is a controversial, and largely scientifically discredited, psychiatric phenomenon which involves an inability to recall autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The concept originated in psychoanalytic theory where repression is understood as a defense mechanism that excludes painful experiences and unacceptable impulses from consciousness. Repressed memory is presently considered largely unsupported by research. Sigmund Freud initially claimed the memories of historical childhood trauma could be repressed, while unconsciously influencing present behavior and emotional responding; he later revised this belief.

While the concept of repressed memories persisted through much of the 1990s, insufficient support exists to conclude that memories can become inconspicuously hidden in a way that is distinct from forgetting. Historically, some psychoanalysts provided therapy based on the belief that alleged repressed memories could be recovered, however, rather than promoting the recovery of a real repressed memory, such attempts could result in the creation of entirely false memories. Subsequent accusations based on such &quot;recovered memories&quot; led to substantial harm of individuals implicated as perpetrators, sometimes resulting in false convictions and years of incarceration.

Due to a lack of evidence for the concept of repressed and recovered memories, mainstream clinical psychologists have stopped using these terms. Clinical psychologist Richard McNally stated: &quot;The notion that traumatic events can be repressed and later recovered is the most pernicious bit of folklore ever to infect psychology and psychiatry. It has provided the theoretical basis for &#x27;recovered memory therapy&#x27;—the worst catastrophe to befall the mental health field since the lobotomy era.&quot;

== History ==
Sigmund Freud discussed repressed memory in his 1896 essay, The Aetiology of Hysteria.
One of the studies published in his essay involved a young woman referred to as Anna O., who had been treated by Freud&#x27;s friend and colleague Josef Breuer. Among her many ailments, Anna O. had stiff paralysis on the right side of her body. Freud hypothesized that her symptoms were attached to psychological traumas; the traumatic experiences had been repressed from her conscious mind, but reappeared as physical symptoms. Breuer used hypnosis to treat Anna O. She is reported to have gained slight mobility on her right side.

The concept received renewed interest in the 1970s in relation to child sexual abuse and incest. Coming to be labelled &quot;The Recovered Memory Movement&quot; and &quot;Memory Wars&quot; or &quot;The Memory War&quot;, it became a major issue in pop culture during the 1980s and 1990s, connected to Satanic panic, and spawned a myriad of legal cases, controversies, and media. &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; (1980), a discredited book by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his wife/former patient Michelle Smith about Smith&#x27;s fabricated experiences with repressed memories of childhood Satantic rituals and abuse, gained widespread popularity that persisted after debunking, influenced subsequent claims, and received promotion from media including Oprah, Geraldo Rivera, Sally Jesse Raphael, and 20/20. Starting in the 1980s, repressed memory legal cases increased rapidly. In 1989, a landmark legal case developed when George Franklin was charged and convicted in 1990 for the rape and murder of 8-year-old Susan Kay Nason on September 22, 1969, based on the account of his daughter, Eileen Franklin&#x27;s recovered memories. Originally sentenced to life imprisonment, a district court judge overturned the conviction in 1995 based on several trial errors including the unreliability of hypnosis that was used. Eileen Franklin would further accuse her father of raping and murdering 18-year-old Veronica Cascio and 17-year-old Paula Baxter. George Franklin was released in July 1996 after prosecutors announced they would not retry him, and in 2018, the DNA evidence linked Rodney Lynn Halbower to the Cascio and Baxter murders. He was convicted of both murders and sentenced to life in prison. In 1991, People magazine featured Marilyn Van Derbur and Roseanne Barr&#x27;s experiences with childhood abuse and repressed memory. Van Derbur&#x27;s oldest sister Gwen verified her account, though Barr would later moderate her claims. Such cases and reactions led to the definition of false memory syndrome and establishment of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in 1992. The Ramona false memory case in 1994 was another landmark case, where father Gary Ramona successfully sued for malpractice against Western Medical Center in Anaheim, its chief of psychiatry Richard Rose, and therapist Marche Isabella, for implanting false memories of child abuse while treating his daughter Holly for depression and bulimia. It was also notable for being brought by a third party not involved in the doctor-patient relationship and contributed to continued evaluation of the phenomenon. Skepticism and criticism of repressed memory continued to mount through the 1990s, 2000s, and beyond, emphasizing unreliability, false claims, and lack of examples in historical records.

== Issues ==
=== Case studies ===
Psychiatrist David Corwin has claimed that one of his cases provides evidence for the reality of repressed memories. This case involved a patient (the Jane Doe case) who, according to Corwin, had been seriously abused by her mother, had recalled the abuse at age six during therapy with Corwin, then eleven years later was unable to recall the abuse before memories of the abuse returned to her mind again during therapy. An investigation of the case by Elizabeth Loftus and Melvin Guyer, however, raised serious questions about many of the central details of the case as reported by Corwin, including whether or not Jane Doe was abused by her mother at all, suggesting that this may be a case of false memory for childhood abuse with the memory &quot;created&quot; during suggestive therapy at the time that Doe was six. Loftus and Guyer also found evidence that, following her initial &quot;recall&quot; of the abuse during therapy at age six, Doe had talked about the abuse during the eleven years in between the sessions of therapy, indicating that even if abuse had really occurred, memory for the abuse had not been repressed. More generally, in addition to the problem of false memories, this case highlights the critical dependence of repression-claims cases on the ability of individuals to recall whether or not they had previously been able to recall a traumatic event; as McNally has noted, people are notoriously poor at making that kind of judgment.

An argument that has been made against the validity of the phenomenon of repressed memories is that there is little (if any) discussion in the historical literature prior to the 19th century of phenomena that would qualify as examples of memory repression or dissociative amnesia. In response to Harrison Pope&#x27;s 2006 claim that no such examples exist, Ross Cheit, a political scientist at Brown University, cited the case of Nina, a 1786 opera by the French composer Nicolas Dalayrac, in which the heroine, having forgotten that she saw her lover apparently killed in a duel, waits for him daily. Pope claims that even this single fictional description does not clearly meet all criteria for evidence of memory repression, as opposed to other phenomena of normal memory.

Despite the claims by proponents of the reality of memory repression that any evidence of the forgetting of a seemingly traumatic event qualifies as evidence of repression, research indicates that memories of child sexual abuse and other traumatic incidents may sometimes be forgotten through normal mechanisms of memory. Evidence of the spontaneous recovery of traumatic memories has been shown, and recovered memories of traumatic childhood abuse have been corroborated; however, forgetting trauma does not necessarily imply that the trauma was repressed. One situation in which the seeming forgetting, and later recovery, of a &quot;traumatic&quot; experience is particularly likely to occur is when the experience was not interpreted as traumatic when it first occurred, but then, later in life, was reinterpreted as an instance of early trauma.

A review by Alan Sheflin and Daniel Brown in 1996 found 25 previous studies of the subject of amnesia of childhood sexual abuse. All 25 &quot;demonstrated amnesia in a subpopulation&quot;, including more recent studies with random sampling and prospective designs. On the other hand, in a 1998 editorial in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; Harrison Pope wrote that &quot;on critical examination, the scientific evidence for repression crumbles.&quot; He continued, &quot;asking individuals if they &#x27;remember whether they forgot&#x27; is of dubious validity. Furthermore, in most retrospective studies corroboration of the traumatic event was either absent or fell below reasonable scientific standards.&quot;

===Authenticity===
Memories &quot;can&quot; be accurate, but they are not &quot;always&quot; accurate. For example, eyewitness testimony even of relatively recent dramatic events is notoriously unreliable. Memories of events are a mix of fact overlaid with emotions, mingled with interpretation and &quot;filled in&quot; with imaginings. Skepticism regarding the validity of a memory as factual detail is warranted. For example, one study where victims of documented child abuse were reinterviewed many years later as adults, 38% of the women denied any memory of the abuse.

Various manipulations are considered to be able to implant false memories (sometimes called &quot;pseudomemories&quot;). Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus has noted that some of the techniques that some therapists use in order to supposedly help the patients recover memories of early trauma (including such techniques as age regression, guided visualization, trance writing, dream work, body work, and hypnosis) are particularly likely to contribute to the creation of false or pseudo memories. Such therapy-created memories can be quite compelling for those who develop them, and can include details that make them seem credible to others. In a now classic experiment by Loftus (widely known as the &quot;Lost in the Mall&quot; study), participants were given a booklet containing three accounts of real childhood events written by family members and a fourth account of a wholly fictitious event of being lost in a shopping mall. A quarter of the subjects reported remembering the fictitious event, and elaborated on it with extensive circumstantial detail. This experiment inspired many others, and in one of these, Porter et al. convinced about half of the participants that they had survived a vicious animal attack in childhood.

Critics of these experimental studies have questioned whether their findings generalize to memories for real-world trauma or to what occurs in psychotherapeutic contexts. However, when memories are &quot;recovered&quot; after long periods of amnesia, particularly when extraordinary means were used to secure the recovery of memory, it is now widely (but not universally) accepted that the memories have a high likelihood of being false, i.e. &quot;memories&quot; of incidents that had not actually occurred. It is thus recognised by professional organizations that a risk of implanting false memories is associated with some similar types of therapy. The &quot;American Psychological Association&quot; advises: &quot;...most leaders in the field agree that although it is a rare occurrence, a memory of early childhood abuse that has been forgotten can be remembered later; however, these leaders also agree that it is possible to construct convincing pseudomemories for events that never occurred.&quot;

Not all therapists agree that false memories are a major risk of psychotherapy and they argue that this idea overstates the data and is untested. Several studies have reported high percentages of the corroboration of recovered memories, and some authors have claimed that among skeptics of idea of recovered memory there is a &quot;tendency to conceal or omit evidence of corroboration&quot; of recovered memories.

A difficult issue for the field is that there is no evidence that reliable discriminations can be made between true and false memories. Some believe that memories &quot;recovered&quot; under hypnosis are particularly likely to be false.
According to The Council on Scientific Affairs for the American Medical Association, recollections obtained during hypnosis can involve confabulations and pseudomemories and appear to be less reliable than nonhypnotic recall.
Brown et al. estimate that 3 to 5% of laboratory subjects are vulnerable to post-event misinformation suggestions. They state that 5–8% of the general population is the range of high-hypnotizability. Twenty-five percent of those in this range are vulnerable to suggestion of pseudomemories for peripheral details, which can rise to 80% with a combination of other social influence factors. They conclude that the rates of memory errors run 0–5% in adult studies, 3–5% in children&#x27;s studies and that the rates of false allegations of child abuse allegations run 4–8% in the general population.

===Mechanisms===
Those who argue in favor of the validity of the phenomenon of repressed memory have identified three mechanisms of normal memory that may explain how memory repression may occur: retrieval inhibition, motivated forgetting, and state-dependent remembering.

====Retrieval inhibition====
Retrieval inhibition refers to a memory phenomenon where remembering some information causes forgetting of other information. Anderson and Green have argued that for a linkage between this phenomenon and memory repression; according to this view, the simple decision to not think about a traumatic event, coupled with active remembering of other related experiences (or less traumatic elements of the traumatic experience) may make memories for the traumatic experience itself less accessible to conscious awareness. However, two problems with this viewpoint have been raised: (1) the evidence for the basic phenomenon itself has not consistently replicated, and (2) the phenomenon does not meet all criteria that must be met to support memory repression theory, particularly the lack of evidence that this form of forgetting is particularly likely to occur in the case of traumatic experiences.

====Motivated forgetting====
The motivated forgetting phenomenon, which is also sometimes referred to as intentional or directed forgetting, refers to forgetting which is initiated by a conscious goal to forget particular information. In the classic intentional forgetting paradigm, participants are shown a list of words, but are instructed to remember certain words while forgetting others. Later, when tested on their memory for all of the words, recall and recognition is typically worse for the deliberately forgotten words. A problem for viewing motivated forgetting as a mechanism of memory repression is that there is no evidence that the intentionally forgotten information becomes, first, inaccessible and then, later, retrievable (as required by memory repression theory).

====State-dependent remembering====
The term state-dependent remembering refers to the evidence that memory retrieval is most efficient when an individual is in the same state of consciousness as they were when the memory was formed. Based upon her research with rats, Radulovic has argued that memories for highly stressful traumatic experiences may be stored in different neural networks than is the case with memories for non-stressful experiences, and that memories for the stressful experiences may then be inaccessible until the organism&#x27;s brain is in a neurological state similar to the one that occurred when the stressful experience first occurred. At present, however, there is no evidence that what Radulovic found with rats occurs in the memory systems of humans, and it is not clear that human memories for traumatic experiences are typically &quot;recovered&quot; by placing the individual back in the mental state that was experienced during the original trauma.

===Amnesia===
Amnesia is partial or complete loss of memory that goes beyond mere forgetting. Often it is temporary and involves only part of a person&#x27;s experience. Amnesia is often caused by an injury to the brain, for instance after a blow to the head, and sometimes by psychological trauma. Anterograde amnesia is a failure to remember new experiences that occur after damage to the brain; retrograde amnesia is the loss of memories of events that occurred before a trauma or injury. Dissociative amnesia is defined in the DSM-5 as the &quot;inability to recall autobiographical information&quot; that is (a) &quot;traumatic or stressful in nature&quot;, (b) &quot;inconsistent with ordinary forgetting&quot;, (c) &quot;successfully stored&quot;, (d) involves a period of time when the patient is unable to recall the experience, (e) is not caused by a substance or neurological condition, and (f) is &quot;always potentially reversible&quot;. McNally and others have noted that this definition is essentially the same as the defining characteristics of memory repression, and that all of the reasons for questioning the reality of memory repression apply equally well to claims regarding dissociative amnesia.

===Effects of trauma on memory===
The essence of the theory of memory repression is that it is memories for traumatic experiences that are particularly likely to become unavailable to conscious awareness, even while continuing to exist at an unconscious level. A prominent more specific theory of memory repression, &quot;Betrayal Trauma Theory&quot;, proposes that memories for childhood abuse are the most likely to be repressed because of the intense emotional trauma produced by being abused by someone the child is dependent on for emotional and physical support; in such situations, according to this theory, dissociative amnesia is an adaptive response because it permits a relationship with the powerful abuser (whom the child is dependent upon) to continue in some form.

Psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk divided the effects of traumas on memory functions into four sets:
* Traumatic amnesia; this involves the loss of memories of traumatic experiences. The younger the subject and the longer the traumatic event is, the greater the chance of significant amnesia. He stated that subsequent retrieval of memories after traumatic amnesia is well documented in the literature, with documented examples following natural disasters and accidents, in combat soldiers, in victims of kidnapping, torture and concentration camp experiences, in victims of physical and sexual abuse, and in people who have committed murder.
* Global memory impairment; this makes it difficult for subjects to construct an accurate account of their present and past history. &quot;The combination of lack of autobiographical memory, continued dissociation and of meaning schemes that include victimization, helplessness and betrayal, is likely to make these individuals vulnerable to suggestion and to the construction of explanations for their trauma-related affects that may bear little relationship to the actual realities of their lives&quot;
* Dissociative processes; this refers to memories being stored as fragments and not as unitary wholes.
* Traumatic memories&#x27; sensorimotor organization. Not being able to integrate traumatic memories seems to be linked to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

According to van der Kolk, memories of highly significant events are usually accurate and stable over time; aspects of traumatic experiences appear to get stuck in the mind, unaltered by time passing or experiences that may follow. The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be different from those of nontraumatic events, perhaps because of alterations in attentional focusing or the fact that extreme emotional arousal interferes with memory. van der Kolk and Fisler&#x27;s hypothesis is that under extreme stress, the memory categorization system based in the hippocampus fails, with these memories kept as emotional and sensory states. When these traces are remembered and put into a personal narrative, they are subject to being condensed, contaminated and embellished upon.

A significant problem for trauma theories of memory repression is the lack of evidence with humans that failures of recall of traumatic experiences result from anything other than normal processes of memory that apply equally well to memories for traumatic and non-traumatic events. In addition, it is clear that, rather than being pushed out of consciousness, the difficulty with traumatic memories for most people is their inability to forget the traumatic event and the tendency for memories of the traumatic experience to intrude upon consciousness in problematic ways.

Evidence from psychological research suggests that most traumatic memories are well remembered over long periods of time. Autobiographical memories appraised as highly negative are remembered with a high degree of accuracy and detail. This observation is in line with psychological understanding of human memory, which explains that highly salient and distinctive events—common characteristics of negative traumatic experiences—are remembered well. When experiencing highly emotional, stressful events, physiological and neurological responses, such as those involving the limbic system, specifically the amygdala and hippocampus, lead to more consolidated memories. Evidence shows that stress enhances memory for aspects and details directly related to the stressful event. Furthermore, behavioural and cognitive memory-enhancing responses, such as rehearsing or revisiting a memory in one&#x27;s mind are also more likely when memories are highly emotional. When compared to positive events, memory for negative, traumatic experiences are more accurate, coherent, vivid, and detailed, and this trend persists over time. This sample of what is a vast body of evidence calls into question how it is possible that traumatic memories, which are typically remembered exceptionally well, might also be associated with patterns of extreme forgetting.

The high quality remembering for traumatic events is not just a lab-based finding but has also been observed in real-life experiences, such as among survivors of child sexual abuse and war-related atrocities. For example, researchers who studied memory accuracy in child sexual abuse survivors 12 to 21 years after the event(s) ended found that the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder was positively correlated with the degree of memory accuracy. Further, all persons who identified the child sexual abuse as the most traumatic event of their life, displayed highly accurate memory for the event. Similarly, in a study of World War II survivors, researchers found that participants who scored higher on posttraumatic stress reactions had war memories that were more coherent, personally consequential, and more rehearsed. The researchers concluded that highly distressing events can lead to subjectively clearer memories that are highly accessible.

=== Legal status ===
Serious issues arise when recovered but false memories result in public allegations; false complaints carry serious consequences for the accused. A special type of false allegation, false memory syndrome, arises typically within therapy, when people report the &quot;recovery&quot; of childhood memories of previously unknown abuse. The influence of practitioners&#x27; beliefs and practices in the eliciting of false &quot;memories&quot; and of false complaints has come under particular criticism.

Some criminal cases have been based on a witness&#x27;s testimony of recovered repressed memories, often of alleged childhood sexual abuse. In some jurisdictions, the statute of limitations for child abuse cases has been extended to accommodate the phenomena of repressed memories as well as other factors. The repressed memory concept came into wider public awareness in the 1980s and 1990s followed by a reduction of public attention after a series of scandals, lawsuits, and license revocations.

A U.S. District Court accepted repressed memories as admissible evidence in a specific case. Dalenberg argues that the evidence shows that recovered memory cases should be allowed to be prosecuted in court.

The apparent willingness of courts to credit the recovered memories of complainants but not the absence of memories by defendants has been commented on: &quot;It seems apparent that the courts need better guidelines around the issue of dissociative amnesia in both populations.&quot;

In 1995, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in &quot;Franklin v. Duncan&quot; and &quot;Franklin v. Fox, Murray&quot; &quot;et al&quot;. (312 F3d. 423, see also 884 FSupp 1435, N.D. Calif.), that repressed memory is not admissible as evidence in a legal action because of its unreliability, inconsistency, unscientific nature, tendency to be therapeutically induced evidence, and subject to influence by hearsay and suggestibility. The court overturned the conviction of a man accused of murdering a nine-year-old girl purely based upon the evidence of a 21-year-old repressed memory by a lone witness, who also held a complex personal grudge against the defendant.

In a 1996 ruling, a U.S. District Court allowed repressed memories entered into evidence in court cases. Jennifer Freyd writes that Ross E. Cheit&#x27;s case of suddenly remembered sexual abuse is one of the most well-documented cases available for the public to see. Cheit prevailed in two lawsuits, located five additional victims and tape-recorded a confession.

On December 16, 2005, the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal issued a certificate confirming a Miscarriage of Justice to a former nun, Nora Wall whose 1999 conviction for child rape was partly based on repressed-memory evidence. The judgement stated that:

On August 16, 2010, the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals in a case reversed the conviction that relied on claimed victim memories of childhood abuse stating that &quot;The record here suggests a &quot;reasonable likelihood&quot; that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted. The &quot;new and material evidence&quot; in this case is the post-conviction consensus within the social science community that suggestive memory recovery tactics can create false memories&quot; (pg 27 FRIEDMAN v. REHAL Docket No. 08-0297). The ruling goes on to order all previous convictions and plea bargains relying in repressed memories using common memory recovered techniques be reviewed.

=== Recovered memory therapy ===

The term &quot;recovered memory therapy&quot; refers to the use of a range of psychotherapy methods that involve guiding the patient&#x27;s attempts to recall memories of abuse that had previously been forgotten. The term &quot;recovered memory therapy&quot; is not listed in DSM-V nor is recovered memory therapy recommended by mainstream ethical and professional mental health associations. Critics of recovered memory therapy note that the therapy can create false memories through its use of powerful suggestion techniques. It has also been found that patients who retract their claims—after deciding their recovered memories are false—may have post-traumatic stress disorder due to the trauma of illusory memories.

<text>Alpha Bank is a private Greek bank. Its founder was John Kostopoulos Alpha Bank&#x27;s Network in Greece has 273 branches and 783 ATMs.

The Group operates in Greece, United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Cyprus with a network of 287 retail outlets (273 in Greece, 12 in Cyprus, 1 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Luxembourg) and employs 8,487 people in Greece and abroad.

Alpha Bank has been listed on the Athens Stock Exchange since November 1925.

==History==
===First years===
Ioannis F. Kostopoulos, a textile merchant from Sperhogeia in Messinia, founded a commercial shop in 1882 in Kalamata and in 1885 he started to be active in foreign exchange trading. In 1916 the trading house was transformed into a bank under the &quot;Bank I. F. Kostopoulos&quot; with the participation of Laiki Bank of Dionysios
Loverdos. In 1918 the bank was transformed from a limited partnership into a joint-stoick company called &quot;Bank of Kalamata.

After the death of Ioannis F. Kostopoulos, the reins of the bank were taken over initially by Spyros Kostopoulos and then by Dimitrios Kostopoulos, who in 1923 merged the banking division of the commercial house &quot;Ioannis F. Kostopoulos&quot; with the Bank of Kalamon, creating the &quot;Bank of Hellenic Commercial Credit&quot; based in Athens. On 2 November 1925 the bank was listed on the Athens Stock Exchange and in 1932 the bank moved to a privately owned building on
Stadiou and Pezmazoglou streets.

The economic crisis of 1929 forced the &quot;Bank of Hellenic Commercial Credit&quot; to reduce its network of branches and to seek financing from the National Bank of Greece, which now appointed a representative to its board of directors. Dimitris Kostopoulos was succeeded in the leadership of the bank by his sons Spyros and Stavros Kostopoulos.

The war period that would follow would lead the bank to a dead end, which would liquidate almost all its assets. The board of directors will even call an extraordinary general meeting on 19 December 1944 to dissolve the company. The dissolution would not take place due to the events of Dekemvriana and after the Treaty of Varkiza the decision of the directors would be revised.

=== Post-war period ===
In 1947 the name of the bank was changed to &quot;Commercial Credit Bank&quot;. After the difficult 1950s, marked by a recession, the bank began to focus on developing a national network of branches. In 1965, Manufacturers Hanover Trust 15, the fourth largest bank at the time, United California Bank, and N.V. Slavenburg&#x27;s Dutch Bank would join the company&#x27;s capital stock.

In the 1970s, Yannis Kostopoulos, son of Spyros Kostopoulos, joined the management of the company. The bank promoted a new corporate identity, renamed itself &quot;Credit Bank&quot; and adopted the reverse of the silver stater of Aegina as its archetype.[17] In 1979 the bank celebrated its 100th anniversary. In 1984, after the death of his father Spyros, Yannis Kostopoulos assumed the duties of chairman of the board of directors. Under his leadership, the bank expanded its activities to other sectors through the establishment of dozens of subsidiaries.

In 1989 the bank expanded its activities to London with the establishment of a Representative Office, which shortly afterwards, in 1993, would become a branch. In 1993 the bank established &quot;Banca Bucuresti&quot;, today Alpha Bank Romania, becoming the first foreign bank to enter the Romanian banking market.

=== 1994 - 2000 ===

In 1994 the name of the bank was changed again to &quot;Alpha Credit Bank&quot;. In 1997 the bank expanded into Albania with the establishment of branches in all major cities of the country. In 1998, the bank was the first in Greece to launch Alpha Web Banking, which established banking transactions via the Internet, and in the same year the bank expanded to Cyprus with the acquisition of Lombard NatWest Bank Ltd, which would later be renamed Alpha Bank Cyprus.

The following year the bank acquired a majority stake in Kreditna Banka the fourth largest bank in North Macedonia, later renamed Alpha Bank A.D. Skopje. In 1999 the Bank acquired 51% of the shares of Ionian Bank for 272 billion drachmas, making it the largest privatisation ever in Greece. The merger of the two banking institutions was completed in 2000 and the new enlarged bank was named Alpha Bank.

=== 2000 - 2010 ===

In 2002, Alpha Bank expands into the Serbian banking market with the establishment of a branch in Belgrade and two years later, it acquires the majority stake in Jubanka a.d. Belgrade, which is renamed Alpha Bank Srbija A.D. A milestone in the bank&#x27;s course was its promotion to the status of Major National Sponsor and Official Bank of the ATHENS 2004 Olympic Games, making it the largest sponsorship ever in Greece.

In 2005 Dimitrios Mantzounis took over as CEO with Yannis Kostopoulos remaining as chairman of the board of directors of the bank. In 2008 the bank expanded into Ukraine with the acquisition of a majority stake in the newly established Ukrainian bank OJSC Astra Bank.

=== 2010 - today ===
In January 2011, the National Bank of Greece submitted a written proposal to Alpha Bank for a merger of the two banks by absorbing the latter into the former. However, the Board of Directors of Alpha Bank, at its meeting on the 18th of February and after having studied the proposal, decided to reject it on the grounds that the terms were unfavorable for its shareholders. At the end of August of the same year, the agreement between the boards of directors of Alpha Bank and Eurobank EFG to merge the two organizations was announced, which was however revoked in March 2012.

In 2012 Alpha Bank acquired and absorbed Commercial Bank of Greece and in 2014 it acquired the banking activities of Citibank in Greece, including Diners Club cards.

On the 31st of May 2013, the recapitalization of the bank was successfully completed, with the required private participation being more than covered, which resulted in the preservation of Alpha Bank&#x27;s private character.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, Alpha Bank has been selling its assets abroad. In 2013, Alpha Bank sold all the shares of its subsidiary JSC Astra Bank Ukraine to the Ukrainian group Delta Bank, in 2015 the Bulgarian branch to Eurobank Bulgaria AD, in 2016 Alpha Bank A.D. Skopje to Silk Road Capital and in 2017 Alpha Bank Srbija to AIK Banka A.D. Beograd.

On 31 March 2014 Alpha Bank successfully completed its €1.2 billion capital increase. The Bank redeemed the total amount of the Hellenic Republic&#x27;s Preference Shares on 17 April 2014.

In May 2014, Vassilis Rapanos replaced Yannis Kostopoulos as chairman of the board of directors of the bank.

On 26 October 2014 Alpha Bank announced the successful completion of the European Central Bank&#x27;s (ECB) Comprehensive Assessment in the Static Adverse Scenario with CET1 8.07% and Capital Surplus of Euro 1.3 billion. Based on the dynamic adverse assumptions, CET1 stands at 8.45% with Capital Surplus of Euro 1.8 billion. Also in 2014, Alpha Bank took over Citibank&#x27;s Greek retail banking operations.

Alpha Bank requested Emergency Liquidity Assistance (&quot;ELA&quot;) from the Bank of Greece on 16 January 2015. Its total funding from the ECB (ELA and non-ELA) was €29.9 bn as of 30 September 2015. On 17 July 2015 it sold its Bulgarian branches to Postbank (Bulgaria), the subsidiary of fellow Greek bank Eurobank Ergasias.

In November 2015, it was decided to increase the share capital by EUR 2,563,000,000. The increase included a voluntary exchange of bonds for new shares, through which EUR 1,011,000,000 was raised, and a capital increase by cash payment and cancellation of preferential rights of existing shareholders for an amount of EUR 1,552,000,000. As a result of the increase in the bank&#x27;s share capital, the State&#x27;s participation, through the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, was reduced to approximately 11%.

In 2021, Alpha Services and Participations S.A., 100% parent company of Alpha Bank S.A., successfully completed the Share Capital Increase of EUR 800 million by offering 800.000.000.000 new ordinary shares of nominal value of EUR 0,30 each. With the Share Capital Increase, the HFSF&#x27;s stake in the bank was reduced to approximately 9%.

In July 2022, Alpha Bank completed the sale of Alpha Bank Albania to OTP Bank PLC.

In October 2023 it was announced that Alpha Bank in Romania will merge with UniCredit leaving Alpha with a 9.9% holding in the new Romanian bank. The deal made between UniCredit and Alpha Bank included the acquisition by UniCredit of the entire stake that the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund had in Alpha Bank. Consequently, on 13 November 2023, the HFSF sold its 9% share of Alpha Bank to UniCredit.

<text>Saraiki ( &#x27;; also speltSiraiki, orSeraiki) is an Indo-Aryan language of the Lahnda group. It is spoken by 28.84 million people, as per the 2023 Pakistani census, taking prevalence in Southern Punjab with remants in Northern Sindh and the Derajat region.

Saraiki has partial mutual intelligibility with Standard Punjabi, and it shares with it a large portion of its vocabulary and morphology. At the same time in its phonology it is radically different (particularly in the lack of tones, the preservation of the voiced aspirates and the development of implosive consonants), and has important grammatical features in common with the Sindhi language spoken to the south. Saraiki is closely related to Western Punjabi dialects.

Due to effects of dominant languages in Pakistani media like Urdu, Standard Punjabi and English and religious impact of Arabic and Persian, Saraiki like other regional varieties of Pakistan are continuously expanding its vocabulary base with loan words.

==Name==
The present extent of the meaning of &#x27; is a recent development, and the term most probably gained its currency during the nationalist movement of the 1960s. It has been in use for much longer in Sindh to refer to the speech of the immigrants from the north, principally Siraiki-speaking Baloch tribes who settled there between the 16th and the 19th centuries. In this context, the term can most plausibly be explained as originally having had the meaning &quot;the language of the north&quot;, from the Sindhi word &#x27; &#x27;up-river, north&#x27;. This name can ambiguously refer to the northern dialects of Sindhi, but these are nowadays more commonly known as &quot;Siroli&quot; or &quot;Sireli&quot;.

An alternative hypothesis is that &quot;Sarākī&quot; originated in the word &quot;sauvīrā&quot;, or Sauvira, an ancient kingdom which was also mentioned in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata.

Currently, the most common rendering of the name is &quot;Saraiki&quot;. However, &quot;Seraiki&quot; and &quot;Siraiki&quot; have also been used in academia until recently. Precise spelling aside, the name was first adopted in the 1960s by regional social and political leaders.

==Classification and related languages==
Saraiki is a member of Western Punjabi sub family of the Indo-Aryan subdivision of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.

In 1919, Grierson maintained that the dialects of what is now the southwest of Punjab Province in Pakistan constitute a dialect cluster, which he designated &quot;Southern Lahnda&quot; within a putative &quot;Lahnda language&quot;. Subsequent Indo-Aryanist linguists have confirmed the reality of this dialect cluster, even while rejecting the name &quot;Southern Lahnda&quot; along with the entity &quot;Lahnda&quot; itself. Grierson also maintained that &quot;Lahnda&quot; was his novel designation for various dialects up to then called &quot;Western Punjabi&quot;, spoken north, west, and south of Lahore. The local dialect of Lahore is the Majhi dialect of Punjabi, which has long been the basis of standard literary Punjabi. However, outside of Indo-Aryanist circles, the concept of &quot;Lahnda&quot; is still found in compilations of the world&#x27;s languages (e.g. Ethnologue). Saraiki appears to be a transitional language between Punjabi and Sindhi. Spoken in
Upper Sindh as well as the southern Panjab, it is sometimes considered a dialect of either Sindhi or of Panjabi due to a high degree of mutual intelligibility.

===Dialects===
The following dialects have been tentatively proposed for Saraiki:
*Central Saraiki, including Multani: spoken in the districts of Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Leiah, Multan and Bahawalpur.
*Southern Saraiki: prevalent in the districts of Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan.
*Sindhi Siraiki: dispersed throughout the province of Sindh and in Kachhi Plain region in Balochistan province.
*Northern Saraiki, or Thali: spoken in the district of Dera Ismail Khan and the northern parts of the Thal region, including Mianwali District and Bhakkar District

The historical inventory of names for the dialects now called Saraiki is a confusion of overlapping or conflicting ethnic, local, and regional designations. One historical name for Saraiki, Jaṭki, means &quot;of the Jaṭṭs&quot;, a northern South Asian ethnic group. Only a small minority of Saraiki speakers are Jaṭṭs, and not all Saraiki speaking Jaṭṭs necessarily speak the same dialect of Saraiki. However, these people usually call their traditions as well as language as &quot;Jataki&quot;. Conversely, several Saraiki dialects have multiple names corresponding to different locales or demographic groups. The name &quot;Derawali&quot; is used to refer to the local dialects of both Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan, but &quot;Ḍerawali&quot; in the former is the Multani dialect and &quot;Derawali&quot; in the latter is the Thaḷi dialect.

When consulting sources before 2000, it is important to know that Pakistani administrative boundaries have been altered frequently. Provinces in Pakistan are divided into districts, and sources on &quot;Saraiki&quot; often describe the territory of a dialect or dialect group according to the districts. Since the founding of Pakistan in 1947, several of these districts have been subdivided, some multiple times.

===Status of language or dialect===
In the context of South Asia, the choice between the appellations &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; is a difficult one, and any distinction made using these terms is obscured by their ambiguity. In a sense both Saraiki and Standard Panjabi are &quot;dialects&quot; of a &quot;Greater Punjabi&quot; macrolanguage. The term &quot;Saraiki&quot; was first introduced for the Multani, Riasti and Derawali dialects of this &quot;Greater Punjabi&quot; macrolanguage in the 1960s as a result of a sociopolitical movement. According to Pakistani politicians such as Hanif Ramay and Fakhar Zaman, the Saraiki linguistic movement was thought to have been pushed by feudal landowners of the Seraiki belt.

Saraiki was considered a dialect of Punjabi by most British colonial administrators, and is still seen as such by many Punjabis. Saraikis, however, consider it a language in its own right and see the use of the term &quot;dialect&quot; as stigmatising.
A language movement was started in the 1960s to standardise a script and promote the language. The national census of Pakistan has tabulated the prevalence of Saraiki speakers since 1981.

==Geographical distribution==
===Pakistan===
Saraiki is primarily spoken in the south-western part of the province of Punjab, in an area that broadly coincides with the extent of the proposed South Punjab Province. To the west, it is set off from the Pashto- and Balochi-speaking areas by the Suleiman Range, while to the south-east the Thar desert divides it from the Marwari language. Its other boundaries are less well-defined: Punjabi is spoken to the east; Sindhi is found to the south, after the border with Sindh province; to the north, the southern edge of the Salt Range is the rough divide with the northern varieties of Lahnda, such as Pothwari.

Saraiki is the first language of approximately 29 million people in Pakistan according to the 2023 census. The first national census of Pakistan to gather data on the prevalence of Saraiki was the census of 1981. In that year, the percentage of respondents nationwide reporting Saraiki as their native language was 9.83. In the census of 1998, it was 10.53% out of a national population of 132 million, for a figure of 13.9 million Saraiki speakers resident in Pakistan. Also according to the 1998 census, 12.8 million of those, or 92%, lived in the province of Punjab.

===India===
After Partition in 1947, Hindu and Sikh speakers of Saraiki migrated to India, where they are currently widely dispersed, though with more significant pockets in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir. There is also a smaller group of Muslim pastoralists who migrated to India, specifically Andhra Pradesh, prior to Partition.

There are census figures available – for example, in the 2011 census, people reported their language as &quot;Bahawal Puri&quot;, and as &quot;Hindi Multani&quot;. However, these are not representative of the actual numbers, as the speakers will often refer to their language using narrower dialect or regional labels, or alternatively identify with the bigger language communities, like those of Punjabi, Hindi or Urdu. Therefore, the number of speakers in India remains unknown. There have been observations of Lahnda varieties &quot;merging&quot; into Punjabi (especially in Punjab and Delhi), as well as of outright shift to the dominant languages of Punjabi or Hindi. One pattern reported in the 1990s was for members of the younger generation to speak the respective &quot;Lahnda&quot; variety with their grandparents, while communicating within the peer group in Punjabi and speaking to their children in Hindi.

==Phonology==
Saraiki&#x27;s consonant inventory is similar to that of neighbouring Sindhi. It includes phonemically distinctive implosive consonants, which are unusual among the Indo-European languages. In Christopher Shackle&#x27;s analysis, Saraiki distinguishes up to 48 consonants and 9 monophthong vowels.

===Vowels===
The &quot;centralised&quot; vowels tend to be shorter than the &quot;peripheral&quot; vowels . The central vowel is more open and back than the corresponding vowel in neighbouring varieties. Vowel nasalisation is distinctive: &#x27;may you go&#x27; vs. &#x27;may he go&#x27;. Before , the contrast between and is neutralised. There is a high number of vowel sequences, some of which can be analysed as diphthongs. 
===Consonants===
Saraiki possesses a large inventory of consonants:

In its stop consonants, Saraiki has the typical for Indo-Aryan four-fold contrast between voiced and voiceless, and aspirated and unaspirated. In parallel to Sindhi it has additionally developed a set of implosives, so that for each place of articulation there are up to five contrasting stops, for example: voiceless &#x27;custom&#x27; ~ aspirated &#x27;blister&#x27; ~ implosive &#x27;cobweb&#x27; ~ voiced &#x27;niche&#x27; ~ voiced aspirate &#x27;foam&#x27;.

There are five contrasting places of articulation for the stops: velar, palatal, retroflex, dental and bilabial. The dentals are articulated with the blade of the tongue against the surface behind the teeth. The retroflex stops are post-alveolar, the articulator being the tip of the tongue or sometimes the underside.
There is no dental implosive, partly due to the lesser retroflexion with which the retroflex implosive is pronounced. The palatal stops are here somewhat arbitrarily represented with and . In casual speech some of the stops, especially , and , are frequently rendered as fricatives – respectively , and .

Of the nasals, only and are found at the start of a word, but in other phonetic environments there is a full set of contrasts in the place of articulation: . The retroflex is a realised as a true nasal only if adjacent to a retroflex stop, elsewhere it is a nasalised retroflex flap . The contrasts ~ , and ~ are weak; the single nasal is more common in southern varieties, and the nasal + stop cluster is prevalent in central dialects. Three nasals have aspirated counterparts .

The realisation of the alveolar tap varies with the phonetic environment. It is trilled if geminated to and weakly trilled if preceded by or . It contrasts with the retroflex flap ( &#x27;wire&#x27; ~ &#x27;watching&#x27;), except in the variety spoken by Hindus. The fricatives are labio-dental. The glottal fricative is voiced and affects the voice quality of a preceding vowel.

===Phonotactics and stress===
There are no tones in Saraiki. All consonants except can be geminated (&quot;doubled&quot;). Geminates occur only after stressed centralised vowels, and are phonetically realised much less markedly than in the rest of the Punjabi area.

A stressed syllable is distinguished primarily by its length: if the vowel is peripheral then it is lengthened, and if it is a &quot;centralised vowel&quot; () then the consonant following it is geminated. Stress normally falls on the first syllable of a word. The stress will, however, fall on the second syllable of a two-syllable word if the vowel in the first syllable is centralised, and the second syllable contains either a diphthong, or a peripheral vowel followed by a consonant, for example &#x27;carpenter&#x27;. Three-syllable words are stressed on the second syllable if the first syllable contains a centralised vowel, and the second syllable has either a peripheral vowel, or a centralised vowel + geminate, for example &#x27;seventy-four&#x27;. There are exceptions to these rules and they account for minimal pairs like &#x27;informing&#x27; and &#x27;so much&#x27;.

===Implosives===
Unusually for South Asian languages, implosive consonants are found in Sindhi, possibly some Rajasthani dialects, and Saraiki, which has the following series: / /.

The &quot;palatal&quot; is denti-alveolar and laminal, articulated further forward than most other palatals.

The &quot;retroflex&quot; is articulated with the tip or the underside of the tongue, further forward in the mouth than the plain retroflex stops. It has been described as post-alveolar, pre-palatal or pre-retroflex. reports that this sound is unique in Indo-Aryan and that speakers of Multani take pride in its distinctiveness. The plain voiced and the implosive are mostly in complementary distribution although there are a few minimal pairs, like &#x27;doctor&#x27; ~ &#x27;mail&#x27;. The retroflex implosive alternates with the plain voiced dental stop in the genitive postposition/suffix , which takes the form of when combined with 1st or 2nd person pronouns: &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your&#x27;.

A dental implosive () is found in the northeastern Jhangi dialect, considered transitional between Standard Punjabi and Saraiki by ,
which is characterised by a lack of phonemic contrast between implosives and plain stops, and a preference for implosives even in words where Saraiki has a plain stop. The dental implosive in Jhangi is articulated with the tongue completely covering the upper teeth. It is not present in Saraiki, although contends that it should be reconstructed for the earlier language. Its absence has been attributed to structural factors: the forward articulation of and the lesser retroflexion of .

Aspirated (breathy voiced) implosives occur word-initially, where they contrast with aspirated plain stops: &#x27; &#x27;sit&#x27; ~ &#x27; &#x27;fear&#x27;. The aspiration is not phonemic; it is phonetically realised on the whole syllable, and results from an underlying that follows the vowel, thus is phonemically .

The historical origin of the Saraiki implosives has been on the whole the same as in Sindhi. Their source has generally been the older language&#x27;s series of plain voiced stops, thus Sanskrit &#x27; &gt; Saraiki &#x27; &#x27;be born&#x27;. New plain voiced stops have in turn arisen out of certain consonants and consonant clusters (for example, &#x27; &gt; &#x27; &#x27;barley&#x27;), or have been introduced in loanwords from Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian or English (&#x27; &#x27;throat&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;bus&#x27;). The following table illustrates some of the major developments:

Within South Asia, implosives were first described for Sindhi by Stake in 1855. Later authors have noted their existence in Multani and have variously called them &quot;recursives&quot; or &quot;injectives&quot;, while Grierson incorrectly treated them as &quot;double consonants&quot;.

==Writing system==
In the province of Punjab, Saraiki is written using the Arabic-derived Urdu alphabet with the addition of seven diacritically modified letters to represent the implosives and the extra nasals. In Sindh the Sindhi alphabet is used. The calligraphic styles used are Naskh and Nastaʿlīq.

Historically, traders or bookkeepers wrote in a script known as &quot;kiṛakkī&quot; or laṇḍā, although use of this script has been significantly reduced in recent times. Likewise, a script related to the Landa scripts family, known as Multani, was previously used to write Saraiki. A preliminary proposal to encode the Multani script in ISO/IEC 10646 was submitted in 2011. Saraiki Unicode has been approved in 2005. The Khojiki script has also been in use, whereas Devanagari and Gurmukhi are not employed anymore.

==Language use==
===In academia===
The Department of Saraiki, Islamia University, Bahawalpur was established in 1989 and the Department of Saraiki, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan was established in 2006. BS Saraiki is also being offered by English department of Ghazi University, Dera Ghazi Khan and MA Saraiki is being offered by Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan privately. It is taught as a subject in schools and colleges at higher secondary and intermediate. Saraiki is also taught at degree level at the Allama Iqbal Open University at Islamabad, and the Al-Khair University at Bhimbir have Pakistani Linguistics Departments. They offer M.Phil. and Ph.D in Saraiki. The Associated Press of Pakistan has launched a Saraiki version of its site, as well.

===Arts and literature===

The language, partly codified during the British Raj, derived its emotional attraction from the poetry of the Sufi saint, Khawaja Ghulam Farid, who has become an identity symbol. His poems, known as Kafi are still famous.

Shakir Shujabadi (&quot;Kalam-e-Shakir&quot;, &quot;Khuda Janey&quot;, &quot;Shakir Diyan Ghazlan&quot;, &quot;Peelay Patr&quot;, &quot;Munafqan Tu Khuda Bachaway&quot;, and &quot;Shakir De Dohray&quot; are his famous books) is a very well recognized modern poet.

Ataullah Khan Esakhelvi and Shafaullah Rokhri are considered legends of Saraiki music and the most popular singers from the Saraiki belt. 

===Media===
====Television channels====

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani had said southern Punjab is rich in cultural heritage which needs to be promoted for next generations. In a message on the launch of Saraiki channel by Pakistan Television (PTV) in Multan, he is reported to have said that the step would help promote the rich heritage of &#x27;Saraiki Belt&#x27;.

====Radio====
These are not dedicated Saraiki channels but most play programmes in Saraiki.

<text>A Martian packet is an IP packet seen on the public Internet that contains a source or destination address that is reserved for special use by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as defined in , Appendix B Glossary (Martian Address Filtering). On the public Internet, such a packet either has a spoofed source address, and it cannot actually originate as claimed, or the packet cannot be delivered. The requirement to filter these packets (i.e. not forward them) is found in , Section 5.3.7 (Martian Address Filtering).

Martian packets commonly arise from IP address spoofing in denial-of-service attacks, but can also arise from network equipment malfunction or misconfiguration of a host.

In Linux terminology, a Martian packet is an IP packet received by the kernel on a specific interface, while routing tables indicate that the source IP is expected on another interface.

The name is derived from &quot;packet from Mars&quot;, meaning that packet seems to be not of this Earth.

==IPv4 and IPv6==
In both IPv4 and IPv6, a Martian packet has a source address, a destination address, or both within one of the special-use ranges.

==Transition mechanisms==
===6to4===
6to4 is an IPv6 transition technology where the IPv6 address encodes the originating IPv4 address such that every IPv4 has a corresponding, unique IPv6 prefix. Because 6to4 relays use the encoded value for determining the end site of the 6to4 tunnel, 6to4 addresses corresponding to IPv4 Martians are not routable and should never appear on the public Internet.

===Teredo tunneling===
Teredo is another IPv6 transition technology that encodes the originating IPv4 address in the IPv6 address. However, the encoding format encodes the Teredo server address and tunnel information before the IPv4 client address. Thus there is no definable set of prefixes more specific than for Teredo packets with Martian end-site addresses. It is, however, possible to spoof Teredo packets with the Teredo server IPv4 address set to a Martian.

== Implementation ==
Some of the large router have functionality to filter out specifically for Martian Filtering packet and address.

* Juniper Junos OS has . 
* Cisco IOS does not have Martian Filtering, and uses 
* Cisco Small Business has 

==See also==

* Bogon filtering
* Christmas tree packet

<doc id="509689" wikidata="Q214269" url="?curid=509689" title="The Martians (scientists)">
<text>&quot;The Martians&quot; () were a group of prominent scientists (mostly, but not exclusively, physicists and mathematicians) of Hungarian Jewish descent who emigrated from Europe to the United States in the early half of the 20th century.

Leo Szilard, who jokingly suggested that Hungary was a front for aliens from Mars, used this term. In an answer to the question of why there is no evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth (called the Fermi paradox) despite the high probability of it existing, Szilárd responded: &quot;They are already here among us they just call themselves Hungarians.&quot; This account is featured in György Marx&#x27;s book &quot;The Voice of the Martians.&quot;

==Men included in the description==
Individuals named [by whom?] as members of &quot;The Martians&quot; group include:

* Paul Erdős
* Paul Halmos
* Theodore von Kármán
* John G. Kemeny
* John von Neumann
* George Pólya
* Leó Szilárd
* Edward Teller
* Eugene Wigner
* Franz Alexander
* Peter Carl Goldmark
* John Harsanyi
* Peter Lax
* George Olah
* Egon Orowan
* John Polanyi
* Valentine Telegdi
* Cornelius Lanczos
* George de Hevesy
==Origin of the name==

The original story from György Marx&#x27;s book &quot;The Voice of the Martians&quot;:

When the question was put to Edward Teller who was particularly proud of his monogram, &quot;E.T.&quot; (abbreviation of &quot;extraterrestrial&quot;) he looked worried, and said: &quot;Von Kármán must have been talking.&quot;

According to György Marx, the extraterrestrial origin of the Hungarian scientists is proved by the fact that the names of Leó Szilárd, John von Neumann, and Theodore von Kármán cannot be found on the map of Budapest, but craters can be found on the Moon bearing their names: Szilard, Von Neumann, Von Kármán, and a crater on Mars, Von Kármán.

<text>Pizza is an open-source superset of Java 1.4, prior to the introduction of generics for the Java programming language. In addition to its own solution for adding generics to the language, Pizza also added function pointers and algebraic types with case classes and pattern matching.

In August 2001, the developers made a compiler capable of working with Java. Most Pizza applications can run in a Java environment, but certain cases will cause problems.

Pizza&#x27;s last version was released in January 2002. Its main developers turned their focus afterwards to the Generic Java project: another attempt to add generics to Java that was officially adopted as of
version 5 of the language. The pattern matching and other functional programming-like features have been further developed in the Scala programming language. 
Martin Odersky remarked, &quot;we wanted to integrate the functional and object-oriented parts in a cleaner way than what we were able to achieve before with the Pizza language. [...] In Pizza we did a clunkier attempt, and in Scala I think we achieved a much smoother integration between the two.&quot;

==Example==

public final class Main {
 public int main(String args[]) {
 System.out.println(
 new Lines(new DataInputStream(System.in))
 .takeWhile(nonEmpty)
 .map(fun(String s) -&gt; int { return Integer.parseInt(s); })
 .reduceLeft(0, fun(int x, int y) -&gt; int { return x + y; }));
 while(x == 0) { map.create.newInstance() }

<doc id="509705" wikidata="Q1017593" url="?curid=509705" title="Privity of contract">
<text>The doctrine of privity of contract is a common law principle which provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations upon anyone who is not a party to that contract. It is related to, but distinct from, the doctrine of consideration, according to which a promise is legally enforceable only if valid consideration has been provided for it, and a plaintiff is legally entitled to enforce such a promise only if they are a promisee from whom the consideration has moved.

A principal consequence of the doctrine of privity is that, at common law, a third party generally has no right to enforce a contract to which they are not a party, even where that contract was entered into by the contracting parties specifically for their benefit and with a common intention among all of them that they should be able to enforce it. In England &amp; Wales and Northern Ireland, the doctrine has been substantially weakened by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which created a statutory exception to privity, providing, in certain circumstances, third parties the right to enforce terms of contracts to which they are not privy.

==Third party rights==

Privity of contract occurs only between the parties to the contract, most commonly
contract of sale of goods or services. Horizontal privity arises when the benefits from a contract are to be given to a third party. Vertical privity involves a contract between two parties, with an independent contract between one of the parties and another individual or corporation.

If a third party gets a benefit under a contract, it does not have the right to go against the parties to the contract beyond its entitlement to a benefit. An example of this occurs when a manufacturer sells a product to a distributor and the distributor sells the product to a retailer. The retailer then sells the product to a consumer. There is no privity of contract between the manufacturer and the consumer.

This, however, does not mean that the parties do not have another form of action: for instance, in &quot;Donoghue v. Stevenson&quot; a friend of Ms. Donoghue bought her a bottle of ginger beer, which contained the partially decomposed remains of a snail. Since the contract was between her friend and the shop owner, Mrs. Donoghue could not sue under the contract, but it was established that the manufacturer was in breach of a duty of care owed to her. Accordingly, she was awarded damages in the tort of negligence for having suffered gastroenteritis and &quot;nervous shock&quot;.

==History==
Prior to 1861 there existed decisions in English Law allowing provisions of a contract to be enforced by persons not party to it, usually relatives of a promisee, and decisions disallowing third party rights. The doctrine of privity emerged alongside the doctrine of consideration, the rules of which state that consideration must move from the promise, that is to say that if nothing is given for the promise of something to be given in return, that promise is not legally binding unless promised as a deed. 1833 saw the case of &quot;Price v. Easton&quot;, where a contract was made for work to be done in exchange for payment to a third party. When the third party attempted to sue for the payment, he was held to be not privy to the contract, and so his claim failed. This was fully linked to the doctrine of consideration, and established as such, with the more famous case of &quot;Tweddle v. Atkinson&quot;. In this case the plaintiff was unable to sue the executor of his father-in-law, who had promised to the plaintiff&#x27;s father to make payment to the plaintiff, because he had not provided any consideration to the contract.

The doctrine was developed further in &quot;Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v. Selfridge and Co. Ltd.&quot; through the judgment of Lord Haldane.

Privity of Contract played a key role in the development of negligence as well. In the first case of &quot;Winterbottom v. Wright&quot; (1842), in which Winterbottom, a postal service wagon driver, was injured due to a faulty wheel, attempted to sue the manufacturer Wright for his injuries. The courts however decided that there was no privity of contract between manufacturer and consumer.

This issue appeared repeatedly until &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot; (1916), a case analogous to &quot;Winterbottom v Wright&quot; involving a car&#x27;s defective wheel. Judge Cardozo, writing for the New York Court of Appeals, decided that no privity is required when the manufacturer knows the product is probably dangerous if defective, third parties (e.g. consumers) will be harmed because of said defect, and there was no further testing after initial sale. Foreseeable injuries occurred from foreseeable uses. Cardozo&#x27;s innovation was to decide that the basis for the claim was that it was a tort not a breach of contract. In this way he finessed the problems caused by the doctrine of privity in a modern industrial society. Although his opinion was only law in New York State, the solution he advanced was widely accepted elsewhere and formed the basis of the doctrine of product liability.

==Exceptions==

===Common law exceptions===
There are exceptions to the general rule, allowing rights to third parties and some impositions of obligations. These are:
*Collateral Contracts (between the third party and one of the contracting parties)
*Trusts (the beneficiary of a trust may sue the trustee to carry out the contract)
*Land Law (restrictive covenants on land are imposed upon subsequent purchasers if the covenant benefits neighbouring land)
*Agency and the assignment of contractual rights are permitted.
*Third-party insurance - A third party may claim under an insurance policy made for their benefit, even though that party did not pay the premiums.
*Contracts for the benefit of a group, where a contract to supply a service is made in one person&#x27;s name but is intended to sue at common law if the contract is breached; there is no privity of contract between them and the supplier of the service.

Attempts have been made to evade the doctrine by implying trusts (with varying success), constructing the Law of Property Act 1925 s. 56(1) to read the words &quot;other property&quot; as including contractual rights, and applying the concept of restrictive covenants to property other than real property (without success).

# in case of trust/beneficiary 
# in case of family arrangement
# in case of acknowledgment of debts
# in case of assignment of contract.

===Statutory exceptions===
In England and Wales, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 provided some reform for this area of law which has been criticised by judges such as Lord Denning and academics as unfair in places. The act states:

: 1. - (1) Subject to the provisions of this act, a person who is not a party to a contract (a &quot;third party&quot;) may in his own right enforce a term of the contract if-
:: (a) the contract expressly provides that he may, or
:: (b) subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on him.
: (2) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply if on a proper construction of the contract it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.

This means that a person who is named in the contract as a person authorised to enforce the contract or a person receiving a benefit from the contract may enforce the contract unless it appears that the parties intended that he may not.

The Act enables the aim of the parties to be fully adhered to. In &quot;Beswick v Beswick&quot;, the agreement was that Peter Beswick assign his business to his nephew in consideration of the nephew employing him for the rest of his life and then paying a weekly annuity to Mrs. Beswick. Since the latter term was for the benefit of someone not party to the contract, the nephew did not believe it was enforceable and so did not perform it, making only one payment of the agreed weekly amount. Yet the only reason why Mr. Beswick contracted with his nephew was for the benefit of Mrs. Beswick. Under the Act, Mrs. Beswick would be able to enforce the performance of the contract in her own right. Therefore, the Act realises the intentions of the parties.

The law has been welcomed by many as a relief from the strictness of the doctrine, however it may still prove ineffective in professionally drafted documents, as the provisions of this statute may be expressly excluded by the draftsmen.

In Hong Kong, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance provided for a similar legal effect as the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

===Third-party beneficiaries===
In Australia, it has been held that third-party beneficiaries may uphold a promise made for its benefit in a contract of insurance to which it is not a party (&quot;Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v. McNiece Bros Pty Ltd&quot; (1988) 165 CLR 107). The decision in &quot;Trident&quot; had no clear ratio, and did not create a general exemption to the doctrine of privity in Australia.

Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have all enacted statutory provisions to enable third party beneficiaries to enforce contracts, and limited the ability of contracting parties to vary the contract after the third party has relied on it. In addition, section 48 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) allows third-party beneficiaries to enforce contracts of insurance.

Although damages are the usual remedy for the breach of a contract for the benefit of a third party, if damages are inadequate, specific performance may be granted (&quot;Beswick v. Beswick&quot; [1968] AC 59).

The issue of third-party beneficiaries has appeared in cases where a stevedore has claimed it is covered under the exclusion clauses in a bill of lading. In order for this to succeed, three factors must be made out:
* The bill of lading must clearly intend to benefit the third party.
* It is clear that when the carrier contracts with the consignor, it also contracts as an agent of the stevedore. That is, either the carrier must have had authority by the stevedore to act on its behalf, or the stevedore must later ratify (endorse) the actions of the carrier.
* Any difficulties with consideration moving from the stevedores must be made out.

The last issue was explored in &quot;New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v. A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd&quot; [1975] AC 154, where it was held that the stevedores had provided consideration for the benefit of the exclusion clause by the discharge of goods from the ship.

New Zealand has enacted the Contracts Privity Act 1982, which enables third parties to sue if they are sufficiently identified as beneficiaries by the contract, and in the contract it is expressed or implied they should be able to enforce this benefit. An example case of not being &quot;sufficiently identified&quot; is that of &quot;Field v Fitton&quot; (1988).

<text>Waldemar Bonsels (21 February 1880 – 31 July 1952) was a German writer and creator of Maya the Bee. He was born in Ahrensburg.

Bonsels&#x27;s most famous work is the children&#x27;s book &quot;Die Biene Maja und ihre Abenteuer&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Maya the Bee&quot;). This work served the basis for a Japanese animated television series &quot;Maya the Honey Bee&quot; in the mid-1970s, as well as a Croatian opera for children written by Bruno Bjelinski. The opera was staged in 2008 in Villach, Austria at the Carinthian Summer Music Festival. &quot;Himmelsvolk&quot; (&quot;People in the Sky&quot;) is a sequel with a more philosophical focus, describing in mystical terms the unity of all creation and its relationship to God.

He wrote a number of novels and shorter stories dealing with love as Eros and the higher level of divine love in the spirit of romanticism (&quot;Eros und die Evangelien&quot;, &quot;Menschenwege&quot;, &quot;Narren und Helden&quot;, etc.), and about the relationship between man and nature in a simple life unchanged by modern civilisation (&quot;Anjekind&quot;, etc.). Bonsels also wrote a historical novel about the time of Jesus (&quot;Der Grieche Dositos&quot;).

He travelled extensively in Europe and Asia, which resulted in the book &quot;Indienfahrt&quot; (&quot;Voyage in India&quot;). 

Bonsels was an outspoken antisemite and expressed his approval of Nazi politics against Jews in 1933, calling the Jew &quot;a deadly enemy&quot; who was &quot;poisoning the culture&quot; in an article (&quot;NSDAP und Judentum&quot;) which was widely published. He died in Ambach, Münsing.

<text>Khawaja Ghulam Farid (also romanized as Fareed; /1845 – 24 July 1901) was a 19th-century Sufi poet and mystic from Bahawalpur, Punjab, British India, belonging to the Chishti Order. Most of his work is in his mother tongue &quot;Multani&quot;, or what is now known as Saraiki. However, he also contributed to the Punjabi, Urdu, Pashto, Sindhi, Hindi and Persian literature. His writing style is characterized by the integration of themes such as death, passionate worldly and spiritual love, and the grief associated with love.

==Life==
He was born into a branch of the Koreja family who claimed descent from Umar (), the second Rashidun caliph through an early migrant to Sindh. The family was established as saints associated with the Suhrawardī Sufi order. Originally from Thatta, Sindh, the family seat later moved to Mithankot in the early 18th century on the invitation of a disciple and subsequently transferred their allegiance to the Chishtī order. Khawaja Farid was born /1845 at Chachran. Farid&#x27;s father died when he was around eight years of age. He was then brought up by his elder brother, Khawaja Fakhr al-Dīn, and grew up to become a scholar and writer. He received a fine formal education at the royal palace of Ṣādiq Muḥammad IV, the Nawab of Bahawalpur. His brother Fakhr al-Dīn, who had brought him up after their parents&#x27; deaths, also died when Farid was 26 years old. Farid performed &quot;hajj&quot; (pilgrimage to Mecca) in 1875, and then retired to the Cholistan Desert (also known as &quot;Rohi&quot;) for &quot;chilla&quot; (retreat) where he spent a total of eighteen years. He died at Chachran on 24 July, 1901, and was buried at Mithankot.

==Works==
His most significant works include:
* &quot;Dīwān-i Farīd&quot;
* &quot;Manāqib-i maḥbūbiyya&quot; (Persian prose)
* &quot;Fawāʾid-i Farīdiyya&quot; (Persian prose)

== Legacy ==

*A literary award named after Farid the Khwaja Ghulam Farid Award is awarded yearly by the Pakistan Academy of Letters in literature, its recipients including Ismail Ahmedani (in 2013) and Irshad Taunsvi (in 2007) among others.
*Fareed Gate is the name of one of the historic gates surrounding the old city of Bahawalpur named in Farid&#x27;s honour.
*The Khawaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology (KFUEIT) in Rahim Yar Khan District was named after Farid.
* Shrine of Khawaja Ghulam Farid in Rajanpur, Punjab is among the &quot;10 most visited shrines in Pakistan&quot;.

<text>In statistics, Gibbs sampling or a Gibbs sampler is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for sampling from a specified multivariate probability distribution when direct sampling from the joint distribution is difficult, but sampling from the conditional distribution is more practical. This sequence can be used to approximate the joint distribution (e.g., to generate a histogram of the distribution); to approximate the marginal distribution of one of the variables, or some subset of the variables (for example, the unknown parameters or latent variables); or to compute an integral (such as the expected value of one of the variables). Typically, some of the variables correspond to observations whose values are known, and hence do not need to be sampled.

Gibbs sampling is commonly used as a means of statistical inference, especially Bayesian inference. It is a randomized algorithm (i.e. an algorithm that makes use of random numbers), and is an alternative to deterministic algorithms for statistical inference such as the expectation–maximization algorithm (EM).

As with other MCMC algorithms, Gibbs sampling generates a Markov chain of samples, each of which is correlated with nearby samples. As a result, care must be taken if independent samples are desired. Samples from the beginning of the chain (the &quot;burn-in period&quot;) may not accurately represent the desired distribution and are usually discarded.

== Introduction ==
Gibbs sampling is named after the physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs, in reference to an analogy between the sampling algorithm and statistical physics. The algorithm was described by brothers Stuart and Donald Geman in 1984, some eight decades after the death of Gibbs, and became popularized in the statistics community for calculating marginal probability distribution, especially the posterior distribution.

In its basic version, Gibbs sampling is a special case of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. However, in its extended versions (see below), it can be considered a general framework for sampling from a large set of variables by sampling each variable (or in some cases, each group of variables) in turn, and can incorporate the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (or methods such as slice sampling) to implement one or more of the sampling steps.

Gibbs sampling is applicable when the joint distribution is not known explicitly or is difficult to sample from directly, but the conditional distribution of each variable is known and is easy (or at least, easier) to sample from. The Gibbs sampling algorithm generates an instance from the distribution of each variable in turn, conditional on the current values of the other variables. It can be shown that the sequence of samples constitutes a Markov chain, and the stationary distribution of that Markov chain is just the sought-after joint distribution.

Gibbs sampling is particularly well-adapted to sampling the posterior distribution of a Bayesian network, since Bayesian networks are typically specified as a collection of conditional distributions.

== Implementation ==
Gibbs sampling, in its basic incarnation, is a special case of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. The point of Gibbs sampling is that given a multivariate distribution it is simpler to sample from a conditional distribution than to marginalize by integrating over a joint distribution. Suppose we want to obtain formula_1 samples of a formula_2-dimensional random vector formula_3. We proceed iteratively:

* Begin with some initial value formula_4.
* Given a sample formula_5, to obtain the next sample formula_6, we can sample each component formula_7 from the distribution of formula_8, conditioned on all the components sampled so far: we condition on formula_9 for all formula_10, and on formula_11 for formula_12. In other words, we sample formula_7 according to the distribution formula_14.

== Properties ==
If such sampling is performed, these important facts hold:
* The samples approximate the joint distribution of all variables.
* The marginal distribution of any subset of variables can be approximated by simply considering the samples for that subset of variables, ignoring the rest.
* The expected value of any variable can be approximated by averaging over all the samples.

When performing the sampling:
* The initial values of the variables can be determined randomly or by some other algorithm such as expectation–maximization.
* It is not actually necessary to determine an initial value for the first variable sampled.
* It is common to ignore some number of samples at the beginning (the so-called &quot;burn-in period&quot;), and then consider only every formula_2th sample when averaging values to compute an expectation. For example, the first 1,000 samples might be ignored, and then every 100th sample averaged, throwing away all the rest. The reason for this is that (1) the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the desired joint distribution over the variables, but it may take a while for that stationary distribution to be reached; (2) successive samples are not independent of each other but form a Markov chain with some amount of correlation. Sometimes, algorithms can be used to determine the amount of autocorrelation between samples and the value of formula_2 (the period between samples that are actually used) computed from this, but in practice there is a fair amount of &quot;black magic&quot; involved.
* The process of simulated annealing is often used to reduce the &quot;random walk&quot; behavior in the early part of the sampling process (i.e. the tendency to move slowly around the sample space, with a high amount of autocorrelation between samples, rather than moving around quickly, as is desired). Other techniques that may reduce autocorrelation are &quot;collapsed Gibbs sampling&quot;, &quot;blocked Gibbs sampling&quot;, and &quot;ordered overrelaxation&quot;; see below.

=== Relation of conditional distribution and joint distribution ===
Furthermore, the conditional distribution of one variable given all others is proportional to the joint distribution, i.e., for all possible value formula_17 of formula_18:

:formula_19

&quot;Proportional to&quot; in this case means that the denominator is not a function of formula_20 and thus is the same for all values of formula_20; it forms part of the normalization constant for the distribution over formula_20. In practice, to determine the nature of the conditional distribution of a factor formula_20, it is easiest to factor the joint distribution according to the individual conditional distributions defined by the graphical model over the variables, ignore all factors that are not functions of formula_20 (all of which, together with the denominator above, constitute the normalization constant), and then reinstate the normalization constant at the end, as necessary. In practice, this means doing one of three things:
# If the distribution is discrete, the individual probabilities of all possible values of formula_20 are computed, and then summed to find the normalization constant.
# If the distribution is continuous and of a known form, the normalization constant will also be known.
# In other cases, the normalization constant can usually be ignored, as most sampling methods do not require it.

== Inference ==
Gibbs sampling is commonly used for statistical inference (e.g. determining the best value of a parameter, such as determining the number of people likely to shop at a particular store on a given day, the candidate a voter will most likely vote for, etc.). The idea is that observed data is incorporated into the sampling process by creating separate variables for each piece of observed data and fixing the variables in question to their observed values, rather than sampling from those variables. The distribution of the remaining variables is then effectively a posterior distribution conditioned on the observed data.

The most likely value of a desired parameter (the mode) could then simply be selected by choosing the sample value that occurs most commonly; this is essentially equivalent to maximum a posteriori estimation of a parameter. (Since the parameters are usually continuous, it is often necessary to &quot;bin&quot; the sampled values into one of a finite number of ranges or &quot;bins&quot; in order to get a meaningful estimate of the mode.) More commonly, however, the expected value (mean or average) of the sampled values is chosen; this is a Bayes estimator that takes advantage of the additional data about the entire distribution that is available from Bayesian sampling, whereas a maximization algorithm such as expectation maximization (EM) is capable of only returning a single point from the distribution. For example, for a unimodal distribution the mean (expected value) is usually similar to the mode (most common value), but if the distribution is skewed in one direction, the mean will be moved in that direction, which effectively accounts for the extra probability mass in that direction. (If a distribution is multimodal, the expected value may not return a meaningful point, and any of the modes is typically a better choice.)

Although some of the variables typically correspond to parameters of interest, others are uninteresting (&quot;nuisance&quot;) variables introduced into the model to properly express the relationships among variables. Although the sampled values represent the joint distribution over all variables, the nuisance variables can simply be ignored when computing expected values or modes; this is equivalent to marginalizing over the nuisance variables. When a value for multiple variables is desired, the expected value is simply computed over each variable separately. (When computing the mode, however, all variables must be considered together.)

Supervised learning, unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning (aka learning with missing values) can all be handled by simply fixing the values of all variables whose values are known, and sampling from the remainder.

For observed data, there will be one variable for each observation—rather than, for example, one variable corresponding to the sample mean or sample variance of a set of observations. In fact, there generally will be no variables at all corresponding to concepts such as &quot;sample mean&quot; or &quot;sample variance&quot;. Instead, in such a case there will be variables representing the unknown true mean and true variance, and the determination of sample values for these variables results automatically from the operation of the Gibbs sampler.

Generalized linear models (i.e. variations of linear regression) can sometimes be handled by Gibbs sampling as well. For example, probit regression for determining the probability of a given binary (yes/no) choice, with normally distributed priors placed over the regression coefficients, can be implemented with Gibbs sampling because it is possible to add additional variables and take advantage of conjugacy. However, logistic regression cannot be handled this way. One possibility is to approximate the logistic function with a mixture (typically 7–9) of normal distributions. More commonly, however, Metropolis–Hastings is used instead of Gibbs sampling.

== Mathematical background ==
Suppose that a sample formula_26 is taken from a distribution depending on a parameter vector formula_27 of length formula_28, with prior distribution formula_29. It may be that formula_28 is very large and that numerical integration to find the marginal densities of the formula_31 would be computationally expensive. Then an alternative method of calculating the marginal densities is to create a Markov chain on the space formula_32 by repeating these two steps:

# Pick a random index formula_33
# Pick a new value for formula_34 according to formula_35

These steps define a reversible Markov chain with the desired invariant distribution formula_36. This
can be proved as follows. Define formula_37 if formula_38 for all formula_39 and let formula_40 denote the probability of a jump from formula_41 to formula_42. Then, the transition probabilities are

:formula_43

So
:formula_44

since formula_37 is an equivalence relation. Thus the detailed balance equations are satisfied, implying the chain is reversible and it has invariant distribution formula_36.

In practice, the index formula_47 is not chosen at random, and the chain cycles through the indexes in order. In general this gives a non-stationary Markov process, but each individual step will still be reversible, and the overall process will still have the desired stationary distribution (as long as the chain can access all states under the fixed ordering).

== Gibbs sampler in Bayesian inference and its relation to information theory ==
Let formula_48 denote observations generated from the sampling distribution formula_49 and formula_50 be a prior supported on the parameter space formula_51. Then one of the central goals of the Bayesian statistics is to approximate the posterior density

:formula_52
where the marginal likelihood formula_53 is assumed to be finite for all formula_48. 

To explain the Gibbs sampler, we additionally assume that the parameter space formula_51 is decomposed as

:formula_56,
where formula_57 represents the Cartesian product. Each component parameter space formula_58 can be a set of scalar components, subvectors, or matrices. 

Define a set formula_59 that complements the formula_58. Essential ingredients of the Gibbs sampler is the formula_61-th full conditional posterior distribution for each formula_62
:formula_63.


The following algorithm details a generic Gibbs sampler:

formula_64

formula_65

formula_66

formula_67

formula_68

formula_69

formula_70

formula_68

formula_72

formula_73

Note that Gibbs sampler is operated by the iterative Monte Carlo scheme within a cycle. The formula_74 number of samples formula_75 drawn by the above algorithm formulates Markov Chains with the invariant distribution to be the target density formula_76.

Now, for each formula_77, define the following information theoretic quantities:

formula_78

formula_79

formula_80 

namely, posterior mutual information, posterior differential entropy, and posterior conditional differential entropy, respectively. We can similarly define information theoretic quantities formula_81, formula_82, and formula_83 by interchanging the formula_61 and formula_85 in the defined quantities. Then, the following formula_86 equations hold.

formula_87.

The mutual information formula_88 quantifies the reduction in uncertainty of random quantity formula_89 once we know formula_90, a posteriori. It vanishes if and only if formula_89 and formula_90 are marginally independent, a posterior. The mutual information formula_93 can be interpreted as the quantity that is transmitted from the formula_61-th step to the formula_95-th step within a single cycle of the Gibbs sampler.

== Variations and extensions ==

Numerous variations of the basic Gibbs sampler exist. The goal of these variations is to reduce the autocorrelation between samples sufficiently to overcome any added computational costs.

=== Blocked Gibbs sampler ===
*A blocked Gibbs sampler groups two or more variables together and samples from their joint distribution conditioned on all other variables, rather than sampling from each one individually. For example, in a hidden Markov model, a blocked Gibbs sampler might sample from all the latent variables making up the Markov chain in one go, using the forward-backward algorithm.

=== Collapsed Gibbs sampler ===
*A collapsed Gibbs sampler integrates out (marginalizes over) one or more variables when sampling for some other variable. For example, imagine that a model consists of three variables &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;. A simple Gibbs sampler would sample from &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;), then &quot;p&quot;(&quot;B&quot; | &quot;A&quot;,&quot;C&quot;), then &quot;p&quot;(&quot;C&quot; | &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;). A collapsed Gibbs sampler might replace the sampling step for &quot;A&quot; with a sample taken from the marginal distribution &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;C&quot;), with variable &quot;B&quot; integrated out in this case. Alternatively, variable &quot;B&quot; could be collapsed out entirely, alternately sampling from &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;C&quot;) and &quot;p&quot;(&quot;C&quot; | &quot;A&quot;) and not sampling over &quot;B&quot; at all. The distribution over a variable &quot;A&quot; that arises when collapsing a parent variable &quot;B&quot; is called a compound distribution; sampling from this distribution is generally tractable when &quot;B&quot; is the conjugate prior for &quot;A&quot;, particularly when &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are members of the exponential family. For more information, see the article on compound distributions or Liu (1994).

==== Implementing a collapsed Gibbs sampler ====

===== Collapsing Dirichlet distributions =====

In hierarchical Bayesian models with categorical variables, such as latent Dirichlet allocation and various other models used in natural language processing, it is quite common to collapse out the Dirichlet distributions that are typically used as prior distributions over the categorical variables. The result of this collapsing introduces dependencies among all the categorical variables dependent on a given Dirichlet prior, and the joint distribution of these variables after collapsing is a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. The conditional distribution of a given categorical variable in this distribution, conditioned on the others, assumes an extremely simple form that makes Gibbs sampling even easier than if the collapsing had not been done. The rules are as follows:
#Collapsing out a Dirichlet prior node affects only the parent and children nodes of the prior. Since the parent is often a constant, it is typically only the children that we need to worry about.
#Collapsing out a Dirichlet prior introduces dependencies among all the categorical children dependent on that prior — but &quot;no&quot; extra dependencies among any other categorical children. (This is important to keep in mind, for example, when there are multiple Dirichlet priors related by the same hyperprior. Each Dirichlet prior can be independently collapsed and affects only its direct children.)
#After collapsing, the conditional distribution of one dependent children on the others assumes a very simple form: The probability of seeing a given value is proportional to the sum of the corresponding hyperprior for this value, and the count of all of the &quot;other dependent nodes&quot; assuming the same value. Nodes not dependent on the same prior must not be counted. The same rule applies in other iterative inference methods, such as variational Bayes or expectation maximization; however, if the method involves keeping partial counts, then the partial counts for the value in question must be summed across all the other dependent nodes. Sometimes this summed up partial count is termed the &quot;expected count&quot; or similar. The probability is &quot;proportional to&quot; the resulting value; the actual probability must be determined by normalizing across all the possible values that the categorical variable can take (i.e. adding up the computed result for each possible value of the categorical variable, and dividing all the computed results by this sum).
#If a given categorical node has dependent children (e.g. when it is a latent variable in a mixture model), the value computed in the previous step (expected count plus prior, or whatever is computed) must be multiplied by the actual conditional probabilities (&quot;not&quot; a computed value that is proportional to the probability!) of all children given their parents. See the article on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution for a detailed discussion.
#In the case where the group membership of the nodes dependent on a given Dirichlet prior may change dynamically depending on some other variable (e.g. a categorical variable indexed by another latent categorical variable, as in a topic model), the same expected counts are still computed, but need to be done carefully so that the correct set of variables is included.

===== Collapsing other conjugate priors =====

In general, any conjugate prior can be collapsed out, if its only children have distributions conjugate to it. The relevant math is discussed in the article on compound distributions. If there is only one child node, the result will often assume a known distribution. For example, collapsing an inverse-gamma-distributed variance out of a network with a single Gaussian child will yield a Student&#x27;s t-distribution. (For that matter, collapsing both the mean and variance of a single Gaussian child will still yield a Student&#x27;s t-distribution, provided both are conjugate, i.e. Gaussian mean, inverse-gamma variance.)

If there are multiple child nodes, they will all become dependent, as in the Dirichlet-categorical case. The resulting joint distribution will have a closed form that resembles in some ways the compound distribution, although it will have a product of a number of factors, one for each child node, in it.

In addition, and most importantly, the resulting conditional distribution of one of the child nodes given the others (and also given the parents of the collapsed node(s), but &quot;not&quot; given the children of the child nodes) will have the same density as the posterior predictive distribution of all the remaining child nodes. Furthermore, the posterior predictive distribution has the same density as the basic compound distribution of a single node, although with different parameters. The general formula is given in the article on compound distributions.

For example, given a Bayes network with a set of conditionally independent identically distributed Gaussian-distributed nodes with conjugate prior distributions placed on the mean and variance, the conditional distribution of one node given the others after compounding out both the mean and variance will be a Student&#x27;s t-distribution. Similarly, the result of compounding out the gamma prior of a number of Poisson-distributed nodes causes the conditional distribution of one node given the others to assume a negative binomial distribution.

In these cases where compounding produces a well-known distribution, efficient sampling procedures often exist, and using them will often (although not necessarily) be more efficient than not collapsing, and instead sampling both prior and child nodes separately. However, in the case where the compound distribution is not well-known, it may not be easy to sample from, since it generally will not belong to the exponential family and typically will not be log-concave (which would make it easy to sample using adaptive rejection sampling, since a closed form always exists).

In the case where the child nodes of the collapsed nodes themselves have children, the conditional distribution of one of these child nodes given all other nodes in the graph will have to take into account the distribution of these second-level children. In particular, the resulting conditional distribution will be proportional to a product of the compound distribution as defined above, and the conditional distributions of all of the child nodes given their parents (but not given their own children). This follows from the fact that the full conditional distribution is proportional to the joint distribution. If the child nodes of the collapsed nodes are continuous, this distribution will generally not be of a known form, and may well be difficult to sample from despite the fact that a closed form can be written, for the same reasons as described above for non-well-known compound distributions. However, in the particular case that the child nodes are discrete, sampling is feasible, regardless of whether the children of these child nodes are continuous or discrete. In fact, the principle involved here is described in fair detail in the article on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution.

=== Gibbs sampler with ordered overrelaxation ===
*A Gibbs sampler with ordered overrelaxation samples a given odd number of candidate values for formula_96 at any given step and sorts them, along with the single value for formula_97 according to some well-defined ordering. If formula_97 is the &quot;s&quot;th smallest in the sorted list then the formula_96 is selected as the &quot;s&quot;th largest in the sorted list. For more information, see Neal (1995).

=== Other extensions ===
It is also possible to extend Gibbs sampling in various ways. For example, in the case of variables whose conditional distribution is not easy to sample from, a single iteration of slice sampling or the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm can be used to sample from the variables in question.
It is also possible to incorporate variables that are not random variables, but whose value is deterministically computed from other variables. Generalized linear models, e.g. logistic regression (aka &quot;maximum entropy models&quot;), can be incorporated in this fashion. (BUGS, for example, allows this type of mixing of models.)

== Failure modes ==

There are two ways that Gibbs sampling can fail. The first is when there are islands of high-probability states, with no paths between them. For example, consider a probability distribution over 2-bit vectors, where the vectors (0,0) and (1,1) each have probability , but the other two vectors (0,1) and (1,0) have probability zero. Gibbs sampling will become trapped in one of the two high-probability vectors, and will never reach the other one. More generally, for any distribution over high-dimensional, real-valued vectors, if two particular elements of the vector are perfectly correlated (or perfectly anti-correlated), those two elements will become stuck, and Gibbs sampling will never be able to change them.

The second problem can happen even when all states have nonzero probability and there is only a single island of high-probability states. For example, consider a probability distribution over 100-bit vectors, where the all-zeros vector occurs with probability , and all other vectors are equally probable, and so have a probability of formula_100 each. If you want to estimate the probability of the zero vector, it would be sufficient to take 100 or 1000 samples from the true distribution. That would very likely give an answer very close to . But you would probably have to take more than formula_101 samples from Gibbs sampling to get the same result. No computer could do this in a lifetime.

This problem occurs no matter how long the burn-in period is. This is because in the true distribution, the zero vector occurs half the time, and those occurrences are randomly mixed in with the nonzero vectors. Even a small sample will see both zero and nonzero vectors. But Gibbs sampling will alternate between returning only the zero vector for long periods (about formula_102 in a row), then only nonzero vectors for long periods (about formula_102 in a row). Thus convergence to the true distribution is extremely slow, requiring much more than formula_102 steps; taking this many steps is not computationally feasible in a reasonable time period. The slow convergence here can be seen as a consequence of the curse of dimensionality.
A problem like this can be solved by block sampling the entire 100-bit vector at once. (This assumes that the 100-bit vector is part of a larger set of variables. If this vector is the only thing being sampled, then block sampling is equivalent to not doing Gibbs sampling at all, which by hypothesis would be difficult.)

<text>Rotenone is an odorless, colorless, crystalline isoflavone. It occurs naturally in the seeds and stems of several plants, such as the jicama vine, and in the roots of several other members of the Fabaceae. It was the first-described member of the family of chemical compounds known as rotenoids. Rotenone is approved for use as a piscicide to remove alien fish species, see &quot;Uses.&quot; It has also been used as a broad-spectrum insecticide, but its use as an insecticide has been banned in many countries.

== Discovery ==

The earliest written record of the now-known rotenone-containing plants used for killing leaf-eating caterpillars was in 1848; for centuries, these same plants had been used to poison fish. The active chemical component was first isolated in 1895 by a French botanist, Emmanuel Geoffroy, who called it &quot;nicouline&quot;, from a specimen of &quot;Robinia nicou&quot;, now called &quot;Deguelia utilis&quot;, while traveling in French Guiana. He wrote about this research in his thesis, published in 1895 after his death from a parasitic disease. In 1902 Kazuo Nagai, Japanese chemical engineer of the Government-General of Taiwan, isolated a pure crystalline compound from &quot;Derris elliptica&quot; which he called rotenone, after the Taiwanese name of the plant 蘆藤 () translated into Japanese . By 1930, nicouline and rotenone were established to be chemically the same.

== Uses ==

=== Use as piscicide in fisheries management ===
When absorbed through the gills, rotenone disrupts cellular respiration in fish, and may lead to their death, depending on the concentration used. Due to this, it has become a key tool in managing ecosystems affected by invasive or unwanted fish species, and as of 2024 there are no viable options that can replace its versatile value in fish removal actions.

Its value in ecosystem restoration is appreciated due to its rapid degradation, when exposed to light and warm temperatures, making it a temporary measure with minimal long-term environmental effects, see &quot;Rotenone and Ecosystem Impact&quot;.

Rotenone is used as a nonselective piscicide (fish killer). Rotenone has historically been used by indigenous peoples to catch fish. Typically, rotenone-containing plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, are crushed and introduced into a body of water, and as rotenone interferes with cellular respiration, the affected fish rise to the surface in an attempt to gulp air, where they are more easily caught.

In modern times it is frequently used as a tool to remove alien fish species, as it has a relatively short half-life (days) and is gone from rivers in the course of days and from lakes within a few months, depending on (seasonal) stirring, organic content, availability of sunlight and temperature. Rotenone has been used by government agencies to kill fish in rivers and lakes in the United States since 1952, and in Canada and Norway since the 1980s. It is less frequently used in EU countries, due to strict regulations, but has seen some use in selected countries such as the UK (Topmouth gudgeon), Sweden (pike and pumpkinseed), Spain (Topmouth gudgeon, Gambusia) and Hungary (Prussian carp).

Rotenone has also seen some use in other field studies in the marine environment needing only small quantities. Small-scale sampling with rotenone is used by fish researchers studying the biodiversity of marine fishes to collect cryptic, or hidden, fishes, which represent an important component of shoreline fish communities, since it has only minor, local and transient environmental side effects.

==== Rotenone degradation and ecosystem impact ====
Rotenone primarily affects gilled organisms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates. Terrestrial animals such as birds, mammals, and amphibians (except tadpoles/larvae) are much less affected by rotenone. When applied in freshwater systems, the treatment dose kills the target fish and usually other gilled species like tadpoles and zooplankton are affected, depending on dosage. However, timing treatments in the fall or winter, when many species are less active, can reduce these impacts. Some taxa may also recover through natural life cycles, such as resting eggs. Its use is more benign for the environment (as compared to drying ponds, or using other piscicides), and studies show that most ecosystems naturally recover within one or two years after rotenone application- with aquatic invertebrates repopulating affected areas, thus restoring initial local biodiversity to its status prior to the introduction of the invasive species.

Rotenone decays through metabolites and its final product is reduced to water and carbon dioxide. It oxidizes to rotenolone, which is about an order of magnitude less toxic than rotenone. In water, the rate of decomposition depends upon several factors, including temperature, pH, water hardness and sunlight. The half-life of rotenone in a pond of 1.1 mean depth ranged from half a day at 24 °C to 3.5 days at 0 °C, but in deeper oligotrophic systems (thus less degradation due to sunlight and organic content) the half-life may be considerably longer.

==== Notable administrations as piscicide ====
Norwegian authorities have been using rotenone since the mid-1980s to eradicate the salmon fluke Gyrodactylus salaris, and as of 2024 48 out of 54 affected river catchments have been treated. Additionally, many lakes and ponds have been rotenone treated in an effort to remove national or regional invasive species, such as Northern pike, roach, minnow, crucian carp, Tench and perch.

In 1992, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officials used rotenone to eradicate an established population of invasive jaguar cichlids from a small pond in Miami-Dade County. Officials were successful in killing every jaguar cichlid (along with every other fish) in the pond, but unsuccessful in eradicating them from Florida; the cichlids had already spread throughout the Miami Canal and its connected waterways, and by 1994, jaguar cichlids had successfully established themselves throughout Southern and Central Florida.

In September 2010, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife officials used rotenone to kill an established population of invasive goldfish present in eastern Oregon&#x27;s Mann Lake, with the intention of not disrupting the lake&#x27;s native Lahontan cutthroat trout population. Rotenone successfully achieved these aims, killing between 179,000–197,000 goldfish and fathead minnows, and only three trout.

Beginning May 1, 2006, Panguitch Lake, a reservoir in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Utah, was treated with rotenone, to potentially eradicate and control the invasive population of Utah chub, which were probably introduced accidentally by anglers who used them as live bait. The lake was restocked with 20,000 rainbow trout in 2006; as of 2016, the lake&#x27;s fish population has recovered.

In 2012, rotenone was used to kill all remaining fish in Stormy Lake (Alaska) due to invasive pike destroying native species, which were reintroduced once the treatment was concluded.
In 2014, rotenone was used to kill all remaining fish in San Francisco&#x27;s Mountain Lake, which is located in Mountain Lake Park, in order to rid it of invasive species introduced since the migration of European settlers to the region.

==== Deactivation ====
Rotenone can be deactivated in water with the use of potassium permanganate to lower toxicity to acceptable levels.

=== Use as insecticide ===
Rotenone was commercialized as &quot;cubé&quot;, &quot;tuba&quot;, or &quot;derris&quot;, in single preparation or in synergistic combination with other insecticides. It has high acute toxicity to mammals, and all insecticidal uses were banned in the United States and Canada, in the EU, in the UK, and in Switzerland. It remains legal as a pesticide in a number of other countries, including Australia and New Zealand; the status and effective date of ban in select countries is provided in the table below.

Rotenone was used in powdered form to treat scabies and head lice on humans, and parasitic mites on chickens, livestock, and pet animals.

In agriculture it was unselective in action and killed potato beetles, cucumber beetles, flea beetles, cabbage worms, raspberry beetles, and asparagus beetles, as well as most other arthropods. It biodegrades rapidly in soil, with 90% degraded after 1–3 months at and three times faster at . The compound decomposes when exposed to sunlight and usually has an activity of six days in the environment.

== Mechanism of action ==
Rotenone works by interfering with the electron transport chain within complex I in mitochondria, which places it in IRAC MoA class 21 (by itself in 21B). It inhibits the transfer of electrons from iron-sulfur centers in complex I to ubiquinone. This interferes with NADH during the creation of usable cellular energy (ATP). Complex I is unable to pass off its electron to CoQ, creating a back-up of electrons within the mitochondrial matrix. Cellular oxygen is reduced to the radical, creating reactive oxygen species, which can damage DNA and other components of the mitochondria.

Rotenone is used in biomedical research to study the oxygen consumption rate of cells, usually in combination with antimycin A (an electron transport chain Complex III inhibitor), oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor) and FCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler).

Rotenone also inhibits microtubule assembly.

== Presence in plants ==
Rotenone is produced by extraction from the roots and stems of several tropical and subtropical plant species, especially those belonging to the genera &quot;Lonchocarpus&quot; and &quot;Derris&quot;.

Some of the plants containing rotenone:
* Hoary pea or goat&#x27;s rue (&quot;Tephrosia virginiana&quot;) – North America
* Jícama (&quot;Pachyrhizus erosus&quot;) – North America
* Cubé plant or lancepod (&quot;Lonchocarpus utilis&quot;) – South America
** The root extract is referred to as cubé resin
* Barbasco (&quot;Lonchocarpus urucu&quot;) – South America
** The root extract is referred to as cubé resin
* Tuba plant (&quot;Derris elliptica&quot;) – southeast Asia and southwest Pacific islands
** The root extract is referred to as derris or derris root
* Jewel vine (&quot;Derris involuta&quot;) – southeast Asia and southwest Pacific islands
** The root extract is referred to as derris or derris root
* Common Mullein (&quot;Verbascum thapsus L.)&quot;
* Cork-bush (&quot;Mundulea sericea&quot;) – southern Africa
* Florida fishpoison tree (&quot;Piscidia piscipula&quot;) – southern Florida, Caribbean
* Several species of &quot;Millettia&quot; and &quot;Tephrosia&quot; in South-east Asian regions

== Mammalian toxicity ==
Rotenone is classified by the World Health Organization as moderately hazardous. It is mildly toxic to humans and other mammals, but extremely toxic to insects and aquatic life, including fish. This higher toxicity in fish and insects is because the lipophilic rotenone is easily taken up through the gills or trachea, but not as easily through the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. Rotenone is toxic to erythrocytes &quot;in vitro&quot;.

The lowest lethal dose for a child is not known, but death occurred in a 3.5-year-old child who had ingested 40 mg/kg rotenone solution. Human deaths from rotenone poisoning are rare because its irritating action causes vomiting. Deliberate ingestion of rotenone can be fatal.

A 2018 study, which examined the effects of rotenone administration on cell cultures that mimicked properties of developing brains, found that rotenone may be a developmental neurotoxicant; that is, that rotenone exposure in the developing fetus may impede proper human brain development, with potentially profound consequences later in life. The study found that rotenone was particularly damaging to dopaminergic neurons, consistent with prior findings.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
In 2000, injecting rotenone into rats was reported to cause the development of symptoms similar to those of Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD). Rotenone was continuously applied over a period of five weeks, mixed with DMSO and PEG to enhance tissue penetration, and injected into the jugular vein. The study does not directly suggest rotenone exposure is responsible for PD in humans, but is consistent with the belief that chronic exposure to environmental toxins increases the likelihood of the disease. In 2011, a US National Institutes of Health study showed a link between rotenone use and Parkinson&#x27;s disease in farm workers, suggesting a link between neural damage and pulmonary uptake by not using protective gear. Exposure to the chemical in the field can be avoided by wearing a gas mask with filter, which is standard HSE procedure in modern application of the chemical.

Studies with primary cultures of rat neurons and microglia have shown low doses of rotenone (below 10 nM) induce oxidative damage and death of dopaminergic neurons, and it is these neurons in the substantia nigra that die in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Another study has also described toxic action of rotenone at low concentrations (5 nM) in dopaminergic neurons from acute rat brain slices. This toxicity was exacerbated by an additional cell stressor – elevated intracellular calcium concentration – adding support to the &#x27;multiple hit hypothesis&#x27; of dopaminergic neuron death.

The neurotoxin MPTP had been known earlier to cause PD-like symptoms (in humans and other primates, though not in rats) by interfering with complex I in the electron transport chain and killing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Further studies involving MPTP have failed to show development of Lewy bodies, a key component to PD pathology. However at least one study recently has found evidence of protein aggregation of the same chemical makeup as that which makes up Lewy bodies with similar pathology to Parkinson&#x27;s disease in aged rhesus monkeys from MPTP. Therefore, the mechanism behind MPTP as it relates to Parkinson&#x27;s disease is not fully understood. Because of these developments, rotenone was investigated as a possible Parkinson-causing agent. Both MPTP and rotenone are lipophilic and can cross the blood–brain barrier.

In 2010, a study was published detailing the progression of Parkinson&#x27;s-like symptoms in mice following chronic intragastric ingestion of low doses of rotenone. The concentrations in the central nervous system were below detectable limits, yet still induced PD pathology.

<doc id="509726" wikidata="Q752027" url="?curid=509726" title="Maya the Bee">
<text>Maya the Bee () is the main character in The Adventures of Maya the Bee, a German book written by Waldemar Bonsels and published in 1912. The book has been published in many other languages and adapted into different media. The first American edition was published in 1922 by Thomas Seltzer and illustrated by Homer Boss. The latter&#x27;s wife Adele Szold-Seltzer (1876-1940), the daughter of Benjamin Szold and younger sister of Henrietta Szold, was the translator. 

The stories revolve around a little bee named Maya and her friends among bees, other insects and other creatures. The book depicts Maya&#x27;s development from an adventurous youngster to a responsible adult member of bee society.

==Plot==
Bonsels&#x27; original book contains fewer than 200 pages. The storyline is centered on the relation of Maya and her many adventures.

Maya is a bee born in a bee hive during internal unrest: the hive is dividing itself into two new colonies. Maya is raised by her teacher, Miss Cassandra. Despite Miss Cassandra&#x27;s warnings, Maya wants to explore the wide world and commits the unforgivable crime of leaving the hive. During her adventures, Maya, now in exile, befriends other insects and braves dangers with them. In the climax of the book, Maya is taken prisoner by hornets, the bees&#x27; sworn enemies.

Prisoner of the hornets, Maya learns of a hornet plan to attack her native hive. Maya is faced with the decision to either return to hive and suffer her due punishment, saving the hive, or leaving the plan unannounced, saving herself but destroying the hive. After severe pondering, she makes the decision to return. In the hive, she announces the coming attack and is unexpectedly pardoned. The forewarned bees triumph over the hornet attack force. Maya, now a heroine of the hive, becomes a teacher like Miss Cassandra and shares her experiences and wisdom with the future generation.

=== Analysis of the book ===

Sulevi Riukulehto suggested that the book may have carried a political message. This view depicts the beehive as a well-organised militarist society and Maya as an ideal citizen. Elements of nationalism also appear when Maya gets angry at a grasshopper for failing to distinguish between bees and wasps (whom she calls &quot;a useless gang of bandits&quot; [&quot;Räubergeschlecht&quot;] that have no &quot;home or faith&quot; [&quot;Heimat und Glauben&quot;]) and at a insulting fly, whom Maya threatens to teach &quot;respect for bees&quot; and with her stinger. Riukulehto interprets this to mean that respect is based on the threat of violence. Collectivism versus individualism is also a theme. Maya&#x27;s independence and departure from the beehive is seen as reproachable, but it is atoned by her warning of the hornets&#x27; attack. This show of loyalty restores her position in the society. In the hornet attack part of the story, the bees&#x27; will to defend the hive and the heroic deaths of bee officers are glorified, often in overtly militarist tones.

After World War II, adaptations toned down the militarist element considerably, and reduced the hornets&#x27; role. The 1975 anime added the character of Willy, a lazy and quite un-warlike drone bee. In the cartoon series, the briskly marching, but ridiculously incompetent ant armies provide a parody of militarism.

==Main characters==
* Maya – Bee: The series main protagonist, she loves freedom and living in the meadow by herself, unlike other bees who live in the hive. She is good, fair, happy and willing to help everybody.
* Miss Cassandra – Bee, a teacher at the Bee-School.

The following characters only appear in the animated series and films:
* Willy – Bee: Lazy, clumsy, and cowardly, sometimes a showoff, but generally good-natured, Willy is not featured in the original Bonsels story, but is a major character in all adaptations other than the 1926 film. His relationship to Maya is depicted inconsistently: in most adaptations, he is her best friend, who is secretly in love with her, prone to jealousy when Maya&#x27;s attentions turn to others. He is often reluctantly dragged into adventures by Maya. 
* Flip (or Philip) – Grasshopper: A wise friend of Maya and Willy, he is introduced first in the animated series. Whether he is meant to be identical with the unnamed grasshopper of the book is unclear.
* Alexander (or Aleksander) – Mouse: Intellectual, whose level of respect among the other creatures, and close friendship with Maya, often sends Willy into jealous rages. He appears only in the second season of the older animated series (1978).

==Films, anime and television==
===1926 film===
German director Wolfram Junghans made a 1926 silent version (&quot;starring&quot; real insects). The film was lost for a decade until the only original copy of the film was found in Finland. The material was restored in 2005 with a new musical score and released on DVD in 2012, in collaboration with the KAVI and the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, and the film was screened in both Hamburg and Helsinki.

===1975 anime===
The most popular and widely known adaptation of the story is the Japanese anime . Originally aired on Japanese TV in 1975, the anime has been dubbed into 42 languages and screened on television in various territories. The Japanese TV series was preceded by Tokyo Kodomo Club&#x27;s musical play based on the short story, presented as &quot;Mitsubachi Māya&quot; (&quot;Maya the Honeybee&quot;), distributed on an LP album.

The original theme was composed by Karel Svoboda and sung by Karel Gott in the German, Czech and Slovak versions, and Zbigniew Wodecki in the Polish version.

===2012 TV series===
In 2012 Studio 100 Animation produced a 78-episode, 13-minute TV series. The series was rendered in CGI animation. A second 52 episode season aired in 2017.

===Film series===
A 2014 film adaptation based upon the 2012 series was released. In 2018, a sequel to the 2014 film, titled &quot;Maya the Bee: The Honey Games&quot;, was released on March 1 in Germany and May 1 in United States. 

A third film, titled &quot;Maya the Bee: The Golden Orb&quot; was released on January 7, 2021, in Australia. It was delayed from its original 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An upcoming spin-off film titled &quot;Arnie &amp; Barney&quot; will be released in early 2026.

==Stage performances==
===Opera===
&quot;Maya the Bee&quot; also served as the basis for a children&#x27;s opera written by the Croatian composer Bruno Bjelinski in 1963. In 2008 it was staged in Villach, Austria, as part of their Carinthian Summer Music Festival. This performance was distinguished by having the &quot;bees&quot; played by children and not professional opera singers as it is usually the case.

===Puppet musical===
Singer-songwriter Nancy Harrow created a jazz-musical version of the story, called &quot;The Adventures of Maya the Bee&quot;, that featured puppets by Zofia Czechlewska. Harrow&#x27;s adaptation was produced in New York City by The Culture Project in 2000, and was revived in 2012.

===Musical===
In October 2016, Belgian company Studio 100 (the current owners of the series) created a Flemish stage musical called &quot;Maya en de Pollenbollen&quot; based on the 2012 series that has the people dressed in costumes for the characters from the show. The show contains songs made by Studio 100 with a few news songs created exclusively for the show. The musical centers around Maya alongside Flip and Beatrice celebrating Willy&#x27;s birthday. The musical later returned in the Spring of 2017.

Since 2016, live actors from the original stage show make numerous appearances at numerous stage shows and special events held by Studio 100. Notably Studio 100&#x27;s annual &quot;De Grote Sinterklaasshow&quot; held from late November till early December featuring Sinterklaas and Zwarte Pieten watching various Studio 100 characters such as Kabouter Plop, and Piet Piraat (including Maya and friends) perform musical numbers on stage. The same actress that portrayed Maya in the musical is also the official Flemish voice of the character and reprised her role for Studio 100&#x27;s &quot;De Liedjestuin&quot; where Maya is singing various Dutch children&#x27;s songs and nursery rhymes. In the French and Walloon version &quot;Le Jardin des Refrains&quot;, Maya is played by a different actress.

==Amusement parks==
After Studio 100&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise, Plopsa began expanding the franchise to its own theme parks. Plopsaland De Panne opened an indoor children&#x27;s area called &quot;Mayaland&quot; on July 3, 2011, before the CGI incarnation&#x27;s begun airing on numerous television stations across Europe. Maya alongside Flip, and Willy would also appear at other Plopsa owned parks such as Plopsa Coo and Plopsa Indoor Hasselt. In Poland, Plopsa opened an indoor theme park called &quot;Majaland Kownaty&quot; which opened to the public on September 28, 2018, which is mostly themed to Maya the Bee but features other Studio 100&#x27;s IPs (such as Bumba and Piet Piraat).

A year after Mayaland opened in Plopsaland, Holiday Park, Germany, a similar Maya the Bee children&#x27;s area called &quot;Majaland&quot; opened on March 31, 2012.

==Video games==
===Video game background===
The origins of the &quot;Maya the Bee&quot; video games originated from a &quot;South Park&quot; video game for the Game Boy Color developed by Crawfish Interactive in development in 1998. The title was eventually cancelled due to &quot;South Park&quot; creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker stating that the game&#x27;s mature themes would be inappropriate for the Game Boy Color, whose major demographic was children. A year later in 1999, the unreleased game&#x27;s engine and assets were reused for two additional Game Boy Color titles from Crawfish and Acclaim - &quot;Maya the Bee &amp; Her Friends&quot;, which was released exclusively in Europe, and &quot;The New Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley&quot;, based on the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen franchise and was released in North America, being the first of the various video games based on the duo.

<text>Ruth S. Aylett (born 1951) is a British author, computer scientist, professor, poet and political activist. She is a professor of computer science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, where she specialises in affective computing, social computing, software agents, and human–robot interaction.

==Research==
Aylett&#x27;s research involves affective computing, social computing, software agents, and human–robot interaction. She is the leader of Socially Competent Robots (SoCoRo), a project of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council that studies whether robots can assist autistic people in learning to recognize facial expressions and other social cues.

She has also studied the use of &quot;emotionally literate&quot; robots for tutoring schoolchildren, developed interactive role-playing software intended to combat bullying, and performed with a robot poet named Sarah the Poetic Robot as part of the Edinburgh Free Fringe.

==Education and career==
Aylett earned a degree in mathematical economics at the London School of Economics, and began her career in computing by working in technical support at International Computers Limited for three years, before moving to the University of Sheffield to work in computing and robotics. She became a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University for five years, and then moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1989, as part of the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute there. She moved again to the University of Salford in 1992, first as part of the IT Institute there and later in the Centre for Virtual Environments. There, she became Professor of Intelligent Virtual Environments in 2000. In 2004, she moved to her present position at Heriot-Watt University.

==Publications==
Aylett&#x27;s book &quot;Robots: Bringing Intelligent Machines to Life?&quot; (2002) is a historical exploration on robots, on the history of robotics, and on research problems confronting roboticists. Aimed at high-school age students, it consists of a sequence of two-page illustrated spreads on each of its topics.

She is the coauthor, with Judy Robertson, Lisa Gjedde, Rose Luckin and Paul Brna, of the self-published book &quot;Inside Stories: A Narrative Journey&quot; (2008), on the use of story-telling in education and the use of technology to assist in storytelling.

Aylett is also the coauthor of the poetry pamphlet &quot;Handfast: Poetry Duets&quot; with Beth McDonough (Mothers Milk, 2016). It has a challenge-response format, in which a poem by one of the authors inspires a poem by the other author exploring the same theme.

Aylett co-authored &quot;Inside DAMMA: the Department of Applied Meta-Magical Anthropology&quot; with Morag Burgon-Lyon, Greg Michaelson and Judy Robertson (Read Fiction, 2023). This satire on contemporary University life was written as part of a project on facilitating academic research cooperation. 

&quot;Equinox&quot; (Stairwell, 2023) was also co-authored with Greg Michaelson. This Science Fiction/Fantasy, written during lockdown, is about how an attempt to extract free energy from beneath Rannoch Moor breaks the multi-verse and angers the witches from Macbeth. 

==Family and politics==
Aylett was born in London. She is the mother of writer and activist Owen Jones. She met her husband, union organiser Robert Jones, through their membership in the Militant tendency, a Trotskyist group within the Labour Party. He developed prostate cancer, and died in 2018.

As a political activist, Aylett has advocated for the Labour Party, for improved labour security for university staff, for permanent residency for European Union citizens already in the UK at the time of Brexit, for academic freedom for faculty and students in the face of the &#x27;Counter-terrorism and security bill&#x27; legislation by signing a letter claiming the bill ran counter to universities mission to foster free speech as well as being &#x27;unenforceable&#x27; and &#x27;unlawful&#x27;, as well as support for transgender rights. She has served as one of the leaders of the Labour Party in Edinburgh Southern.

<doc id="509733" wikidata="Q1531147" url="?curid=509733" title="Glenorchy, Tasmania">
<text>Glenorchy is a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Glenorchy is bound by the River Derwent to the east, Mount Wellington to the west, Hobart City to the south and to the north. The city officially begins at Creek Road New Town, in Hobart&#x27;s northern suburbs, and includes, Moonah, Derwent Park, Lutana, Goodwood, Montrose, Rosetta, Berriedale, Chigwell, Claremont and Austins Ferry. It is the seat of the local government area of the same name, the City of Glenorchy.

Glenorchy draws its name from Glen Orchy, Scotland, meaning &quot;Glen of tumbling waters&quot;.

==Overview==

Glenorchy was first occupied in the year 1804, being mostly agricultural land from the 1820s onward, with orchards being the prime commercial industry for the area. Becoming a municipality in 1864 and then officially a city in 1964, Glenorchy is now a largely suburban, working class area, which grew quickly after WWII when a great number of returning soldiers settled in the northern suburbs.

Glenorchy has entertainment facilities including the Glenorchy Pool, a Village Cinemas complex, KGV Oval which houses the Glenorchy Football Club, and a bowls club. Glenorchy is also home to the Tasmanian Transport Museum and Glenorchy Art and Sculpture Park.

Schools in the area include Glenorchy Primary School, Cosgrove High School, Guilford Young College and Dominic College.

Glenorchy is passed through by the Main Road of Greater Hobart, and the Brooker Highway which is the main connection to surrounding councils. When the Brooker Highway was built in 1952, it extended from Hobart to Berriedale. During this time, areas of Glenorchy and Moonah undertook street widening works in order to cope with increased traffic from the south.

Significant areas of Glenorchy include:
*Elwick is the name given to the area east of the Brooker Highway, including the Elwick Racecourse (where the Hobart Cup is raced) and the Hobart Showground, which represents all of Southern Tasmania.
*Merton refers to the Barossa Road area, and the surrounding bushlands between Glenorchy and Lenah Valley.
*O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge is the name given to the site of first settlement in 1809.

At the 2016 Australian census, the suburban Glenorchy area had a population of 10,828, with the Glenorchy City population totalling 46,397.

==Retail==

The Glenorchy Central business district has three major indoor shopping centres, Northgate Shopping Centre, Glenorchy Central and Glenorchy Plaza. Leading retail stores in Glenorchy include Best &amp; Less, Coles, Woolworths, Big W, and Target, as well as a Bunnings located on the eastern edge of the Hobart show grounds on the Brooker Highway near Goodwood, with access via Howard Road.

Glenorchy has the second largest shopping district in Tasmania, following the Hobart central business district. Glenorchy CBD is one of the three main commercial districts in Glenorchy City, as well as those in Moonah and Claremont.

==Smelter contamination==
The Risdon Zinc Works (trading as Nyrstar Hobart) at nearby Lutana, which has been in operation since 1917, continues to produce heavy metal contaminants affecting the air, land and estuary waters surrounding Greater Hobart.

Drawing from data complied in the National Pollutant Inventory, a report by the Australian Conservation Foundation placed Hobart at number 6 of Australia&#x27;s most polluted cities in 2018. The data identified medium levels of air pollution in postcodes 7009 (Lutana, Derwent Park, Moonah, West Moonah) and 7010 (Glenorchy, Rosetta, Montrose, Goodwood, Dowsing Point) with average air contaminate readings of 40% (nitric oxide () and nitrogen dioxide ()), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) contributing 57% of airborne emissions.

The Tasmanian Planning Scheme does not mandate the Glenorchy City Council to notify prospective buyers about potential land contamination within the City of Glenorchy.

<text>Baron Mostyn, of Mostyn in the County of Flint, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 

==History==
The title was created in 1831 for Sir Edward Lloyd, 2nd Baronet, who had earlier represented Flint Boroughs and Beaumaris in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for Flintshire and Lichfield and served as Lord Lieutenant of Merionethshire.

The second baron had assumed the additional surname of Mostyn by royal licence in 1831, on the death of his mother&#x27;s brother, the last of the Mostyn baronets. His eldest son and heir the Hon. Thomas Lloyd-Mostyn, who also represented Flintshire in Parliament, predeceased his father. Lord Mostyn was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the third Baron (the son of Thomas Lloyd-Mostyn). The 6th Baron died on 22 March 2011 and was succeeded by his only son.

The Baronetcy of Pengwerra in the County of Flint, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1778 for Edward Lloyd, with remainder to his nephews. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his eldest nephew, the aforementioned second Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1831.

The family seat is Mostyn Hall, near Mostyn.

<text>Alan Anthony Silvestri (born March 26, 1950) is an American composer, conductor, orchestrator and music producer of film scores. He has received two Grammy Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards as well as nominations for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

Silvestri also scored many other popular movies, including &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991), &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1992), &quot;Eraser&quot; (1996), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998), &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999), &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001), &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; trilogy, &quot;G.I.

==Early life and education==
Silvestri was born March 26, 1950. His grandparents emigrated in 1909 from the Italian town of Castell&#x27;Alfero, and settled in Teaneck, New Jersey. He grew up in Teaneck, and graduated in 1968 from Teaneck High School. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years. He was a drummer for a short time in 1966 with Teaneck-based rock band the Wildcats.

==Career==
Silvestri moved to Los Angeles in 1970. &quot;I came to Hollywood in 1970 broke... I didn&#x27;t even have any goals or plans. I didn&#x27;t even go to movies. And I knew nothing about composers or composing,&quot; he said. In 1972, while he was working intermittently as a session guitarist, the producer of the low-budget action film &quot;The Doberman Gang&quot; asked him to score the picture. Silvestri agreed, despite a lack of experience: &quot;I went out and bought a how-to-compose book by Earl Hagen... At one point, I was using beer cans for percussion.&quot;

From 1978 to 1983, Silvestri was the main composer for the television series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, writing music for 95 of the show&#x27;s 139 episodes.

Silvestri met film director Robert Zemeckis when they worked together on Zemeckis&#x27;s film &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984). Since then, he has composed the music for all of Zemeckis&#x27;s movies, including the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy (1985–1990), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000), &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004), &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007), &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2009), &quot;Flight&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Walk&quot; (2015).

In 1989, Silvestri composed the score for the James Cameron-directed film &quot;The Abyss&quot;. Since 2001, he has also collaborated regularly with director Stephen Sommers, scoring the films &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001), &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), and &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; (2009). He also composed the ImageMovers opening theme.

Silvestri has composed the scores for four Marvel Cinematic Universe films: &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019). His themes and motifs from those films have been referenced and reprised by other composers in multiple other MCU films. 

Silvestri has also composed music for television series, including &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; (one episode), &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (three episodes), and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (seven episodes). In 2014, he composed the award-winning music for the science documentary series &quot;&quot;. He wrote new songs with Glen Ballard for the live-action/CGI film adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

==Personal life==
Silvestri and his wife Sandra own a vineyard, Silvestri Vineyards, in Carmel Valley, California. He also has a wine tasting room for his vineyards on the ground floor of the Enchanted Oaks Building. He has a daughter and two sons. A licensed pilot, he flies his own jet aircraft.

Silvestri received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music in 1995.

He has won two Emmys, both for &quot;&quot; – Outstanding Main Title Theme Music and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series for the episode &quot;Standing Up in the Milky Way&quot;. He has won the Saturn Award for Best Music three times, for his scores for &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1989/90), and &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004).

<doc id="509739" wikidata="Q644291" url="?curid=509739" title="Ruritania">
<text>Ruritania is a fictional country, originally located in Central Europe as a setting for novels by Anthony Hope, such as &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1894). Nowadays, the term connotes a quaint minor European country or is used as a placeholder name for an unspecified country in academic discussions. The first known use of the demonym &quot;Ruritanian&quot; was in 1896.

Hope&#x27;s setting lent its name to a literary genre involving fictional countries, which is known as Ruritanian romance.

==Fictional country==
Jurists specialising in international law and private international law use Ruritania and other fictional countries when describing a hypothetical case illustrating some legal point. Examples include:

* For example, writes in a legal textbook:
:: ″[t]he question whether obtained good title to a camera which he bought in Ruritania is governed by Ruritanian law, even if the camera had been delivered on &quot;hire purchase terms&quot;, or under a &quot;conditional sale&quot; to s seller in England.″

* In another legal textbook, frequently use “Ruritania” as a placeholder-name when referring to a generic country in hypothetical scenarios in international law.

* Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer cited “Ruritania” as a fictional enemy when illustrating a security treaty between Australia and Indonesia signed on 8 November 2006:
:: &quot;We do not need to have a security agreement with Indonesia so both of us will fight off the &#x27;Ruritanians&#x27;. That&#x27;s not what the relationship is about,&quot; he said. &quot;It is all about working together on the threats that we have to deal with, which are different types of threats.&quot;

* A British court, when contemplating a publication ban relating to a childhood sexual assault case, referred to the country of origin of the child as “Ruritania”, further explaining, &quot;The boy was described in the judgment as having &#x27;dual British and “Ruritanian” nationality&#x27;.&quot;

* The well-known economist L. von Mises used “Ruritania” to discuss currency reform and other issues in economics,
** M. Rothbard – a former student of von Mises – similarly used the fictional country in his own works.
* Polish politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke often uses &quot;Poronia&quot; and &quot;Rurytania&quot; to compare Poland to some Western or Utopian country, e.g. | https://twitter.com/JkmMikke/status/1781649204579856741 |
* BBC radio used “Ruritania” in 1956, as a euphemism for Egypt during the Suez Crisis for on-air discussions of the crisis, in order to circumvent the terms of an agreement with the British government that prevented broadcasting details of the events before they were discussed in parliament.

==Central and southeastern Europe==

Ruritania has also been used to describe the stereotypical development of nationalism in 19th-century Eastern Europe, by Ernest Gellner in &quot;Nations and Nationalism&quot;, in a pastiche of the historical narratives of nationalist movements among Poles, Czechs, Serbians, Romanians, etc. In this story, peasant Ruritanians living in the &quot;Empire of &quot; developed national consciousness through the elaboration of a Ruritanian high culture by a small group of intellectuals responding to industrialization and labor migration.

Author and royal historian Theo Aronson, in his book &quot;Crowns in Conflict&quot; (1986), used the term to describe the semi-romantic and even tribal-like conditions of the Balkan and Romanian cultures before World War I. Walter Lippmann used the word to describe the stereotype that characterized the vision of international relations during and after the War.

Vesna Goldsworthy of Kingston University, in her book &quot;Inventing Ruritania: the imperialism of the imagination&quot; (Yale University Press, 1998), addresses the question of the impact of the work of novelists and film-makers in shaping international perceptions of the Balkans in the framework of an anti-Western type of modernism which has received much criticism from other academics. Goldsworthy&#x27;s theories consider stories and movies about Ruritania to be a form of &quot;literary exploitation&quot; or &quot;narrative colonization&quot; of the peoples of the Balkans.

While discussing how new revolutionary leadership consciously or unconsciously may inherit certain elements of the previous regime, Benedict Anderson, in his book &quot;Imagined Communities&quot;, mentions among other examples &quot;Josip Broz&#x27;s revival of Ruritanian pomp and ceremony.&quot;

<text>Marc Shaiman ( ; born October 22, 1959) is an American composer and lyricist for films, television, and theatre, best known for his collaborations with lyricist and director Scott Wittman, actor Billy Crystal, and director Rob Reiner. Shaiman has received numerous accolades including two Grammy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Tony Award. He has also received seven Academy Award nominations.

== Early life, family and education ==
Shaiman was born to a Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Claire (née Goldfein) and William Robert Shaiman. He grew up in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

He attended Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, but he left school at age 16 to start working in New York&#x27;s theaters; he later obtained a GED.

==Career==
Shaiman started his career as a theatre/cabaret musical director. He started working at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as an arranger/writer. He portrayed Skip St. Thomas, the accompanying pianist for The Sweeney Sisters, a singing duo played by Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks, which earned him an Emmy nomination; he returned for an appearance on &quot;The Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special,&quot; having co-created Martin Short and Maya Rudolph&#x27;s salute to musical sketch characters. He began his professional relationships with Billy Crystal and Martin Short during his tenure at the show. He also was a vocal arranger for Bette Midler, eventually becoming her musical director and co-producer of many of her recordings, including &quot;The Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; and &quot;From a Distance.&quot; He helped create the material for her performance on the penultimate &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. His work with both Midler and Billy Crystal led to his involvement on their films. He later produced Midler&#x27;s album &quot;It&#x27;s the Girls&quot;, which had the highest debut of Midler&#x27;s recording career on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album charts, and co-wrote Crystal&#x27;s farewell to Jay Leno which featured Carol Burnett and Oprah Winfrey among others.

His film credits include &quot;Broadcast News&quot;, &quot;Beaches&quot;, &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;, &quot;City Slickers&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;Sister Act&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;The American President&quot;, &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;, &quot;Patch Adams&quot;, &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Flipped&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; and HBO&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and &quot;61*&quot;. On television, he worked on the final performances for Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; (with Bette Midler), Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; (with Nathan Lane), both of Jay Leno&#x27;s final &quot;Tonight Show&quot; broadcasts, and Nathan Lane&#x27;s farewell to David Letterman called &quot;Dead Inside.&quot;

Shaiman has earned seven Academy Award nominations, a Tony Award and a Grammy Award for his work on the musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;, and an Emmy Award for co-writing Billy Crystal&#x27;s Academy Award performances. He has also been Grammy-nominated for his arrangements for Harry Connick Jr.&#x27;s recordings &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; and &quot;We Are in Love&quot; as well as &quot;Hairspray&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot; and Emmy-nominated for his work on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot;. In 2002, he was honored with the &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Music-In-Film&quot; award at The Hollywood Film Festival, and in 2007 he was honored with ASCAP&#x27;s Henry Mancini Award in recognition of his outstanding achievements and contributions to the music of film and television. He is the first recipient of the Film &amp; TV Music Award for Best Score for a Comedy Feature Film. He wrote and sang the song &quot;Yes&quot; for his agent&#x27;s film &quot;Finding Kraftland&quot;, and co-wrote (with partner Scott Wittman) songs for Neil Patrick Harris when Harris hosted the 63rd Tony Awards (2009) and the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards (2009), and was Emmy-nominated for musical directing and co-writing the 82nd Academy Awards (2010).

Shaiman co-produced and co-wrote cuts on Mariah Carey&#x27;s 2010 Christmas album &quot;Merry Christmas II You&quot;. He and Wittman wrote original songs for the musical-based television show for NBC, &quot;Smash&quot;, which ran from 2012 to 2013, and served as executive producers. For their song &quot;Let Me Be Your Star,&quot; Shaiman and co-lyricist Wittman were nominated for both an Emmy Award and a Grammy Award, and as executive producers they were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical.

Shaiman and Wittman were honored on April 28, 2014, by The New York Pops Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. The following year, Jennifer Hudson sang the &quot;Smash&quot; song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot; at the 87th Academy Awards during the in memoriam tribute, featuring revised lyrics. The duo&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; ran on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, after finishing a four-year run on London&#x27;s West End at The Royal Drury Lane Theater. Shaiman was Tony-nominated for his orchestrations for their previous Broadway musical &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. In 2021, they wrote a song titled &quot;Save the City&quot; for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in-universe Broadway production titled &quot;&quot; featured in the first episode of &quot;Hawkeye&quot;, &quot;Never Meet Your Heroes&quot;. It was released as a single on November 24, the day the episode became available on Disney+.

In February 2021, it was announced that Shaiman and Wittman were writing songs for a new musical adaptation of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 2022 with a book by Amber Ruffin and Matthew Lopez.

==Activism==
In 2008, a controversy erupted nationwide when California Musical Theatre&#x27;s then artistic director Scott Eckern resigned over the revelation of his personal donation of $1,000 to a political campaign to support California Proposition 8, an amendment which enshrined into the California Constitution that &quot;only marriage between a man and a woman [was] recognized in California&quot;. After the amendment was passed, donor information became public. Shaiman and other Broadway artists who had previously worked with the director became critical and called for a boycott of the theatre by all gay artists and performers, ending in the director&#x27;s resignation days later.

To protest the passage of California Proposition 8 in November 2008, Shaiman wrote a satiric mini-musical &quot;Prop 8 – The Musical.&quot; The three-minute video was distributed on the internet at FunnyOrDie.com, beginning on December 3, 2008. It was written and produced in just a few days. The cast includes Jack Black (who plays Jesus), Neil Patrick Harris, John C. Reilly, Allison Janney, Andy Richter, Maya Rudolph, Margaret Cho, and Rashida Jones. Shaiman plays the piano and appears briefly in the video. It received 1.2 million internet hits in its first day.

==Personal life==
He is openly gay, and married Louis Mirabal, a retired lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy, on March 26, 2016. He lives in both Manhattan and upstate New York.

<text>In differential geometry and complex geometry, a complex manifold is a manifold with a &quot;complex structure&quot;, that is an atlas of charts to the open unit disc in the complex coordinate space formula_1, such that the transition maps are holomorphic.

The term &quot;complex manifold&quot; is variously used to mean a complex manifold in the sense above (which can be specified as an &quot;integrable&quot; complex manifold) or an &quot;almost&quot; complex manifold.

==Implications of complex structure==
Since holomorphic functions are much more rigid than smooth functions, the theories of smooth and complex manifolds have very different flavors: compact complex manifolds are much closer to algebraic varieties than to differentiable manifolds.

For example, the Whitney embedding theorem tells us that every smooth &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold can be embedded as a smooth submanifold of R2&quot;n&quot;, whereas it is &quot;rare&quot; for a complex manifold to have a holomorphic embedding into C&quot;n&quot;. Consider for example any compact connected complex manifold &quot;M&quot;: any holomorphic function on it is constant by the maximum modulus principle. Now if we had a holomorphic embedding of &quot;M&quot; into C&quot;n&quot;, then the coordinate functions of C&quot;n&quot; would restrict to nonconstant holomorphic functions on &quot;M&quot;, contradicting compactness, except in the case that &quot;M&quot; is just a point. Complex manifolds that can be embedded in C&quot;n&quot; are called Stein manifolds and form a very special class of manifolds including, for example, smooth complex affine algebraic varieties.

The classification of complex manifolds is much more subtle than that of differentiable manifolds. For example, while in dimensions other than four, a given topological manifold has at most finitely many smooth structures, a topological manifold supporting a complex structure can and often does support uncountably many complex structures. Riemann surfaces, two dimensional manifolds equipped with a complex structure, which are topologically classified by the genus, are an important example of this phenomenon. The set of complex structures on a given orientable surface, modulo biholomorphic equivalence, itself forms a complex algebraic variety called a moduli space, the structure of which remains an area of active research.

Since the transition maps between charts are biholomorphic, complex manifolds are, in particular, smooth and canonically oriented (not just orientable: a biholomorphic map to (a subset of) C&quot;n&quot; gives an orientation, as biholomorphic maps are orientation-preserving).

==Examples of complex manifolds==
* Riemann surfaces.
* Calabi–Yau manifolds.
* The Cartesian product of two complex manifolds.
* The inverse image of any noncritical value of a holomorphic map.

===Smooth complex algebraic varieties===
Smooth complex algebraic varieties are complex manifolds, including:
* Complex vector spaces.
* Complex projective spaces, P&quot;n&quot;(C).
* Complex Grassmannians.
* Complex Lie groups such as GL(&quot;n&quot;, C) or Sp(&quot;n&quot;, C).

===Simply connected===
The simply connected 1-dimensional complex manifolds are isomorphic to either:
* Δ, the unit disk in C
* C, the complex plane
* Ĉ, the Riemann sphere
Note that there are inclusions between these as
Δ ⊆ C ⊆ Ĉ, but that there are no non-constant holomorphic maps in the other direction, by
Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

==Disc vs. space vs. polydisc==
The following spaces are different as complex manifolds, demonstrating the more rigid geometric character of complex manifolds (compared to smooth manifolds):
* complex space formula_1.
* the unit disc or open ball
::formula_3
* the polydisc
::formula_4

==Almost complex structures==

An almost complex structure on a real 2n-manifold is a GL(&quot;n&quot;, C)-structure (in the sense of G-structures) – that is, the tangent bundle is equipped with a linear complex structure.

Concretely, this is an endomorphism of the tangent bundle whose square is −&quot;I&quot;; this endomorphism is analogous to multiplication by the imaginary number &quot;i&quot;, and is denoted &quot;J&quot; (to avoid confusion with the identity matrix &quot;I&quot;). An almost complex manifold is necessarily even-dimensional.

An almost complex structure is &quot;weaker&quot; than a complex structure: any complex manifold has an almost complex structure, but not every almost complex structure comes from a complex structure. Note that every even-dimensional real manifold has an almost complex structure defined locally from the local coordinate chart. The question is whether this almost complex structure can be defined globally. An almost complex structure that comes from a complex structure is called integrable, and when one wishes to specify a complex structure as opposed to an almost complex structure, one says an &quot;integrable&quot; complex structure. For integrable complex structures the so-called Nijenhuis tensor vanishes. This tensor is defined on pairs of vector fields, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; by

:formula_5

For example, the 6-dimensional sphere S6 has a natural almost complex structure arising from the fact that it is the orthogonal complement of &quot;i&quot; in the unit sphere of the octonions, but this is not a complex structure. (The question of whether it has a complex structure is known as the &quot;Hopf problem,&quot; after Heinz Hopf.) Using an almost complex structure we can make sense of holomorphic maps and ask about the existence of holomorphic coordinates on the manifold. The existence of holomorphic coordinates is equivalent to saying the manifold is complex (which is what the chart definition says).

Tensoring the tangent bundle with the complex numbers we get the &quot;complexified&quot; tangent bundle, on which multiplication by complex numbers makes sense (even if we started with a real manifold). The eigenvalues of an almost complex structure are ±&quot;i&quot; and the eigenspaces form sub-bundles denoted by &quot;T&quot;0,1&quot;M&quot; and &quot;T&quot;1,0&quot;M&quot;. The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem shows that an almost complex structure is actually a complex structure precisely when these subbundles are &quot;involutive&quot;, i.e., closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields, and such an almost complex structure is called integrable.

== Kähler and Calabi–Yau manifolds ==
One can define an analogue of a Riemannian metric for complex manifolds, called a Hermitian metric. Like a Riemannian metric, a Hermitian metric consists of a smoothly varying, positive definite inner product on the tangent bundle, which is Hermitian with respect to the complex structure on the tangent space at each point. As in the Riemannian case, such metrics always exist in abundance on any complex manifold. If the skew symmetric part of such a metric is symplectic, i.e. closed and nondegenerate, then the metric is called Kähler. Kähler structures are much more difficult to come by and are much more rigid. 

Examples of Kähler manifolds include smooth projective varieties and more generally any complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold. The Hopf manifolds are examples of complex manifolds that are not Kähler. To construct one, take a complex vector space minus the origin and consider the action of the group of integers on this space by multiplication by exp(&quot;n&quot;). The quotient is a complex manifold whose first Betti number is one, so by the Hodge theory, it cannot be Kähler.

A Calabi–Yau manifold can be defined as a compact Ricci-flat Kähler manifold or equivalently one whose first Chern class vanishes.

<text>James Newton Howard (born June 9, 1951) is an American film composer, orchestrator and music producer. He has scored over 100 films and is the recipient of a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, and nine nominations for Academy Awards.

His film scores include &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991), &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993), &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000), &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005), &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) and its sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) (both composed with Hans Zimmer), &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; (2007) and the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; trilogy (2016–2022). He has collaborated extensively with directors M. Night Shyamalan and Francis Lawrence, having scored eight of Shyamalan&#x27;s films since &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999) and all of Lawrence&#x27;s films since &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (2007). He has also worked with other directors such as Edward Zwick, Michael Hoffman, P.J. Hogan, Andrew Davis, Lawrence Kasdan, Joe Johnston, Taylor Hackford, Ivan Reitman, Joel Schumacher, and David Yates.

== Early life and career ==
Howard was born in Los Angeles. He is from a musical family; his grandmother was a violinist. His father was Jewish but he did not want his children to know he was, so he changed his last name from Horowitz to Howard.

Howard began studying music as a child, taking classical piano lessons at the age of four. He went on to attend the Thacher School in Ojai, California and the Music Academy of the West in Montecito, California with Reginald Stewart and Leon Fleischer. He then attended the University of Southern California, studying at the School of Music as a piano performance major, but dropped out after 6 weeks because &quot;He wanted to do other things than practicing the piano.&quot;

After Howard left college, he joined a short-lived rock band called Mama Lion. The band was led by Neil Merryweather (bass, backing vocals) and featured lead singer Lynn Carey, Coffi Hall on drums, and Rick Gaxiola on guitar. Mama Lion recorded two full-length albums. Members of Mama Lion also formed the band Heavy Cruiser with Merryweather now on lead vocals, recording two albums whose genre was closer to hard rock but also displayed psychedelic and progressive influences. He then worked for a couple of years as a session musician with artists including Diana Ross, Ringo Starr, and Harry Nilsson. In the early 70s, he described himself as being &quot;dirt poor&quot;, until his big break in 1975 when his manager got him an audition with Elton John. He joined John&#x27;s band and toured with them as keyboardist during the late 70s and early 80s. He was part of the band that played Central Park, New York, on September 13, 1980. Howard also arranged strings for several of John&#x27;s songs during this period including the hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; and &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, along with &quot;Tonight&quot; (featuring the London Symphony Orchestra). He played additional keyboards and synthesizers on studio albums including &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; (1975), &quot;Blue Moves&quot; (1976), &quot;21 at 33&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Fox&quot; (1981).

In 1982, Howard was featured on &quot;Toto IV&quot; as the strings conductor and orchestrator for &quot;I Won&#x27;t Hold You Back&quot;, &quot;Afraid of Love&quot;, and &quot;Lovers in the Night&quot;. In 1984 the Sheffield Lab direct-to-disc album &quot;James Newton Howard and Friends&quot;, was released, which featured Toto&#x27;s David Paich (keyboards), Steve Porcaro (keyboards), Jeff Porcaro (drums), and Joe Porcaro (percussion).

In 1983, Howard was co-producer, musician (keyboards), and orchestrator of Riccardo Cocciante&#x27;s album &quot;Sincerità&quot;. He also created five arrangements for the album &quot;Aznavour &#x27;83&quot; by Charles Aznavour, which was recorded in California.

In 1984, Howard composed his first piece of score for a film, receiving a co-writing credit with David Paich for the cue &quot;Trip to Arrakis&quot; in Toto&#x27;s music for the David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;.

After briefly touring with Crosby, Stills, and Nash, he took an opportunity brought to him by his manager to write a score for a film. This career move would lead to his becoming a successful film music composer. During this early foray into film music, Howard returned for a brief collaboration with Elton John on his Tour De Force of Australia in the fall of 1986. He conducted both his own and Paul Buckmaster&#x27;s arrangements during the second half of the set, which focused on orchestrated performances of selected songs from the Elton John catalog.

== 1990s–2000s ==
Howard scored the romantic comedy &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990) and received his first Academy Award nomination for his score for Barbra Streisand&#x27;s drama &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991). Setting the musical mood for numerous films throughout the decade, Howard&#x27;s skills encompassed a plethora of genres, including four more best original score Oscar nominations, for the Harrison Ford action feature &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993), the Julia Roberts romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), and &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; (2007). In addition, Howard scored the Western epic &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994), Kevin Costner&#x27;s &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995), and &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996). His collaborations on songs for &quot;One Fine Day&quot; (1996) and &quot;Junior&quot; (1994) garnered Oscar nominations for Best Song. Along with scoring small-scaled, independent films such as &quot;Five Corners&quot; (1988), &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992), and &quot;American Heart&quot; (1993), Howard proved equally skilled at composing for big-budget Hollywood spectacles, including &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996), &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; (1997) (theme only – score was composed by John Frizzell), and &quot;Collateral&quot; (2004). He has also scored four Disney animated feature films: &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot; (2001), &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002), and &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot; (2021). Although he concentrates primarily on films, Howard has also contributed music for TV, earning an Emmy nomination in 1995 for his theme to NBC&#x27;s ratings smash &quot;ER&quot; (Howard also scored the two-hour pilot); he also provided the themes for &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, winning an Emmy for the latter.

He has scored many of Shyamalan&#x27;s suspense thrillers, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (2000), &quot;Signs&quot; (2002), &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), &quot;Lady in the Water&quot; (2006), &quot;The Happening&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; (2010), notably dropping the intense, yet subtle, opening credit music for &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; from the corresponding soundtrack album.

On October 14, 2005, Howard replaced Howard Shore as composer for &quot;King Kong&quot;, due to &quot;differing creative aspirations for the score&quot; between Shore and director Peter Jackson. The resultant score earned Howard his first Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. His work on &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; earned him an Oscar nomination. He followed in 2008 with his eighth Oscar nomination for Edward Zwick&#x27;s &quot;Defiance&quot;. He also collaborated with Hans Zimmer on the scores for &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and its record-breaking sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;.

Further works were &quot;The Happening&quot;, his sixth film with M. Night Shyamalan, &quot;Blood Diamond&quot;, &quot;Michael Clayton&quot;, &quot;The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, and Shyamalan&#x27;s film adaptation of the Nickelodeon series &quot;.&quot;

Howard debuted his work for symphony orchestra, &quot;I Would Plant A Tree,&quot; in February 2009 as part of the Pacific Symphony&#x27;s annual American Composers Festival. The debut took place at the Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall in Costa Mesa, California, with the Symphony under the direction of Carl St.Clair.

After being replaced in later seasons, his original theme song for the hit TV show &quot;ER&quot; returned for the final episode of the series.

== 2010s ==
In September 2010, he was appointed visiting professor of media composition at the Royal Academy of Music in London.

He composed the Legendary Entertainment fanfare from 2010-2017, and he also composed the 2011 FilmDistrict fanfare.

From 2012 to 2015, James Newton Howard scored the music for the critically acclaimed &quot;Hunger Games&quot; franchise.

From 2014 to 2015, Howard saw major success with &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1&quot; when he composed the score for the movie, which included &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, featuring vocals from actress Jennifer Lawrence. The song peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the highest-charting single from &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; movies and both Howard&#x27;s and Lawrence&#x27;s first chart single.

In 2014, Howard scored two Academy Award-nominated films, &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; and &quot;Maleficent&quot;.

Howard composed the score for the fantasy drama &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, a spin-off/prequel of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, and for its sequels, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot;.

In 2015, James Newton Howard was named the new artistic director of the Henry Mancini Institute (HMI) at the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

On March 23–24, 2019, &quot;Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra&quot; gave the world premiere of Howard&#x27;s Concerto for Cello &amp; Orchestra with LACO principal cello Andrew Shulman as the soloist. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the work as having &quot;an elegiac tone, along with thematic material from the beginning and closing titles of &quot;Red Sparrow&quot;&quot; the score of which Howard was working on while first composing the concerto.

== Personal life ==
When delving into his family history, 25 years after the death of his father, Howard learned that his father was Jewish (the family&#x27;s original surname was &quot;Horowitz&quot;). Although raised Protestant, Howard later became a practicing Reconstructionist Jew after learning that his father was Jewish.

Howard was married to Rosanna Arquette in 1986; they are divorced. From 1990 to 1991, he was in a relationship with Barbra Streisand. He is married to Sophie Howard, with whom he has a son.

== Awards ==
In May 2008, he was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music.

In 2009, he was awarded a Grammy alongside Hans Zimmer for the score soundtrack album to &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;.

In October 2015, he was honored with the Max Steiner Film Music Achievement Award during the annual Hollywood in Vienna concert.

<text>A parking lot or car park (British English), also known as a car lot, is a cleared area intended for parking vehicles. The term usually refers to an area dedicated only for parking, with a durable or semi-durable surface. In most jurisdictions where cars are the dominant mode of transportation, parking lots are a major feature of cities and suburban areas. Shopping malls, sports stadiums, and other similar venues often have immense parking lots. (See also: multistorey car park)

Parking lots tend to be sources of water pollution because of their extensive impervious surfaces, and because most have limited or no facilities to control runoff. Many areas today also require minimum landscaping in parking lots to provide shade and help mitigate the extent to which their paved surfaces contribute to heat islands. Many municipalities require minimum numbers of parking spaces for buildings such as stores (by floor area) and apartment complexes (by number of bedrooms). In the United States, each state&#x27;s Department of Transportation sets the proper ratio for disabled spaces for private business and public parking lots. Modern parking lots use various technologies to enable motorists to pay parking fees, help them find unoccupied spaces and retrieve their vehicles, and improve their parking experiences.

==Urban planning==

The effect of large-scale in-city parking has long been contentious. The replacement of historic structures by garages and lots has led to historical preservation movements in many cities. The massive acreage devoted to parking is widely seen as disruptive to walkable urban fabric, maximizing convenience to each individual building but hampering foot traffic between them. Large paved areas have been called &quot;parking craters&quot;, &quot;parking deserts&quot;, and similar terms, emphasizing their &quot;depopulated&quot; nature and the barriers they can create to walking movement.

=== Parking minimums and maximums ===
Urban planning policies such as parking minimums and maximums can influence the size of private parking lots.

=== Criticism ===
Due to a recent trend towards more livable and walkable communities, parking minimums (policies requiring each building to have a minimum number of parking spaces) have been criticized by both livable streets advocates and developers alike. For a time, the British government recommended that local councils should establish maximum parking standards to discourage car use. American cities such as Washington, DC, are now considering removing parking minimums as a way to add more housing for residents while encouraging the use of public transit.
Parking lots designed specifically for bicycle parking are also becoming more prevalent in response to increased environmental and health consciousness. These may include bicycle parking racks and locks, as well as more modern technologies for security and convenience. For instance, a growing number of bicycle parking lots in Tokyo include automated parking systems.

Efforts to reduce the amount of space dedicated to parking lots for diminishing the dependence on cars, has been taken in Beijing, Mexico City, Delhi and different cities in California. Portland, Minneapolis, Austin abolished the requirement for parking minimum. As of 2 November 2023, Austin (Texas) is the biggest city in the US that has done so - for encouraging, walking, biking, public transit, lowering the cost of housing and increase the amount of housing units that can be built in the city territory.

==Legal issues==
===Sweden and Denmark===

In Sweden and Denmark, there are legally two types of car parking, either on streets and roads, or on private land. A parking violation on streets is a traffic crime, resulting in fines. A parking violation on private land (also if owned by the city) is a contract violation and gives additional parking fee ( = check fee). The difference is small for the car owner and the owner is always responsible.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has two types of car parking: either on public or on private land. The police will investigate any reported accident on public land but have no legal obligation and will not do so on private land. Public road is defined by the Road Traffic Act 1972 and (Amendment) Regulations 1988 S.I. 1988/1036 as: &quot;Road&quot;, in relation to England and Wales, means any highway and any other road to which the public has access, and includes bridges over which a road passes. There is also a House of Lords judgment on this matter.

Civil enforcement officers enforce parking restrictions on public, council-run car parks. These include failure to purchase a ticket as payment (if available)/not parking in a marked bay/other offences.

===United States===
In the United States, each state&#x27;s Department of Transportation sets the proper ratio for disabled spaces for private business and public parking lots. Certain circumstances may demand more designated spaces. These reserved spaces are mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines.

==Payment==
Various forms of technology are used to charge motorists for the use of a parking lot.

Boom gates are used in many parking lots. A customer arrives to the entry ticket machine by vehicle, presses the ticket request push button, takes a ticket - which raises the barrier - and enters the parking lot. To exit the lot, the customer presents the ticket to a cashier in a booth at the exit and tenders payment, after which the cashier opens the boom gate.

In 1954, the first automated parking lots were built where, for a monthly fee, a driver with a magnetic key card could enter and exit the parking lot by raising and lowering the boom.

A more modern system uses automatic pay stations, where the driver presents the ticket and pays the fee required before returning to their car, then drives to the exit terminal and presents the ticket. If the ticket has not been paid for, the boom barrier will not raise, which will force the customer to either press the intercom and speak to a staff member, or reverse out to pay at the pay station or cashier booth.

At some major airports&#x27; parking lots in the United States, a driver can choose to swipe a credit card at the entry ticket dispenser instead of taking a ticket. When the driver swipes the same credit card at the exit terminal upon leaving the lot, the applicable parking fee is automatically calculated and charged to the credit card used.

In some parking lots, drivers present their tickets to and pay the cashiers at a separate cashier&#x27;s office or counter (which are often located elsewhere from the entrances and exits of carparks). Such cashier&#x27;s offices are called shroff offices or simply shroff in some parking lots in Hong Kong and other parts of East Asia influenced by the Hong Kong usage. If a ticket has not been paid, the barrier will not raise. In recent years, cashiers and shroff officers have often been replaced with automated machines. Another variant of payment has motorists paying an attendant on entry to the lot, with the way out guarded by a one-way spike strip that will only allow cars to exit.

Parking meters can also be used, with motorists paying in advance for the time required for the bay they are parked in. Pango (a play on &quot;pay and go&quot;), a company founded in Israel in 2007, created a mobile app that allows users to both find and pay for available metered parking; the app can also be used to pay for garage parking. Users&#x27; accounts are linked to a payment method, and the system remembers where a vehicle is parked and allows users to share a parking session with Facebook friends. Users may also, for a nominal monthly fee per registered car, subscribe to reminders that text alerts shortly before metered time expires, and in some municipalities, users may buy additional metered time via cellphone. Philadelphia, encourages parking space turnover by charging escalating parking fees when metered time is added. Another app, Streetline, whose primary purpose is to help motorists find open parking spots using their smartphones, includes a timer, so users can get back to a parking meter before it expires, and a filter that lets users choose between on-street and off-street parking spaces; it also connects to the phone&#x27;s camera so a user can take a photograph of their car.

Other lots operate on a pay and display system, where a ticket is purchased from a ticket machine and then placed on the dashboard of the car. Parking enforcement officers patrol the lot to ensure compliance with the requirement.

Similar to this is the system where the parking is paid by the mobile phone by sending an SMS message which contains the license plate number. In this case, the virtual cashier books the car and the time when the message is sent, and later a new SMS message must be sent whenever the time is due. The actual payment is then made via the mobile phone bill.

Since 1978 in the United Kingdom, it has been possible to pre-book parking with specialist companies, such as BCP. This is prevalent at all airports, major ports and cities.

==Technology==
Modern parking lots use a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces using parking guidance and information system, retrieve their vehicles, and improve their experience. This includes adaptive lighting, sensors, indoor positioning system (IPS) and mobile payment options. The Santa Monica Place shopping mall in California has cameras on each stall that can help count the lot occupancy and find lost cars.

In outdoor parking lots, GPS can be used to remember the location of a vehicle (some apps saves location automatically when turning off the car when a smartphone breaks communication with a vehicle&#x27;s Bluetooth connection). In indoor parking lots, one option is to record one&#x27;s Wi-Fi signature (signal strengths observed for several detectable access points) to remember the location of a vehicle. Another alternative is to use smartphone applications that does inertial dead reckoning, detection of turns made by the car while driving indoor, correlations of travel time between turns, and machine learning algorithms, to infer the rough location of the parked car based on a map or floorplan.

Online booking technology service providers have been created to help drivers find long-term parking in an automated manner, while also providing significant savings for those who book parking spaces ahead of time. They use real-time inventory management checking technology to display parking lots with availability, sorted by price and distance from the airport.

There are mobile apps providing services for the reservation of long-term parking lot spaces similar to online or aggregate parking facility booking services. Some long-term parking mobile apps also have turn-by-turn maps to locate the parking lot, notably US and UK based ParkJockey.

===Solar canopy parking lots===
Solar canopy parking lots are solar arrays installed on canopies in parking lots. They are up to twice as expensive to install as normal open field solar arrays because the added material in the structure to elevate them for cars to park underneath. They can also be useful at protecting cars from extreme weather and the Sun&#x27;s heat.

== Environmental considerations ==

===Water pollution===
Parking lots tend to be sources of water pollution because of their extensive impervious surfaces. Virtually all of the rain (minus evaporation) that falls becomes urban runoff. To avoid flooding and unsafe driving conditions, the lots are built to channel and collect runoff. Parking lots, along with roads, are often the principal source of water pollution in urban areas.

Motor vehicles are a constant source of pollutants, the most significant being gasoline, motor oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals. are found in combustion byproducts of gasoline, as well as in asphalt and coal tar-based sealants used to maintain parking lots.) Many parking lots are also significant sources of trash which ends up in waterways.

Treatment of pollution: Traditionally, the runoff has been shunted directly into storm sewers, streams, dry wells or even sanitary sewers. However, most larger municipalities now require construction of stormwater management facilities for new lots. Typical facilities include retention basins, infiltration basins and percolation trenches. Some newer designs include bioretention systems, which use plants more extensively to absorb and filter pollutants. However, most existing lots have limited or no facilities to control runoff.

Alternative paving materials: An alternative solution today is to use permeable paving surfaces, such as brick, pervious concrete, stone, special paving blocks, or tire-tread woven mats. These materials allow rain to soak into the ground through the spaces inherent in the parking lot surface. The ground then may become contaminated in the surface of the parking lot park, but this tends to stay in a small area of ground, which effectively filters water before it seeps away. This can however create problems if contaminants seep into groundwater, especially where there is groundwater abstraction &#x27;downstream&#x27; for potable water supply.

===Landscaping===
Many areas today also require minimum landscaping in parking lots. This usually principally means the planting of trees to provide shade. Customers have long preferred shaded parking spaces in the summer, but parking lot providers have long been antagonistic to planting trees because of the extra cost of cleaning the parking lots.

Paved surfaces contribute to heat islands in two ways. The first is through excessive accumulation of heat. Dark materials and the enclosed canyons created by city buildings trap more of the sun&#x27;s energy. The reflection rate of paving compared to natural surfaces is important as higher reflectance means cooler temperatures. Black pavements, the hottest, have solar reflectances of 5 to 10 percent. Lighter pavements have solar reflectance rates of 25 percent or higher. Reflectance values for soils and various types of vegetation range from 5 to 45 percent.
The second cause of heat islands is the low moisture content of paving and building materials. Such materials are watertight, so no moisture is available to dissipate the sun&#x27;s heat through evaporation.

Tree planting has been shown to significantly reduce temperatures in open, paved areas. In one study in Alabama, daytime summer temperatures of were recorded in the centre of a bare parking lot, whereas where a small island of trees was present, temperatures only reached . It also found that a further 1 °F temperature reduction could be obtained for every additional canopy tree planted.

More recently, parking lots have been seen as prime real estate for installing large solar panel installations, with the additional benefit of shade for vehicles parked underneath.

===Land usage===
A parking lot needs fairly large space, around per parking spot. This means that lots usually need more land area than for corresponding buildings for offices or shops if most employees and visitors arrive by car. This means covering large areas with asphalt.

===Services===
Some lots have charging stations for battery vehicles. Some regions with especially cold winters provide electricity at most parking spots for engine block heaters, as antifreeze may be inadequate to prevent freezing.

=== Impact on climate ===
Parking lots are responsible for many greenhouse gas emissions because they increase driving and contributing to the urban heat island due to the materials they are built from.

== Notable Lots ==
* The remains of Richard III were found under a parking lot in Leicester, England. 
* A species of tardigrade, Macrobiotus shonaicus, was discovered in a parking lot in Tsuruoka, Japan.
* The West Edmonton Mall has the world&#x27;s largest parking lot.

<text>Pteris (brake) is a genus of about 300 species of ferns in the subfamily Pteridoideae of the family Pteridaceae. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, southward to New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, north to Japan and North America. 78 species (35 endemic) are found in China. Some species of &quot;Pteris&quot; have considerable economic and ecological value, such as &quot;Pteris multifida&quot;, &quot;Pteris ensiformis&quot;, &quot;Pteris vittata&quot; can be used for ornamental purposes; as a hyperaccumulator, &quot;Pteris multifida&quot; and &quot;Pteris vittata&quot; can be used to control soil pollution.

Many of them have linear frond segments, and some have sub-palmate division. Like other members of the Pteridaceae, the frond margin is reflexed over the marginal sori. The outermost layer is the single layered epidermis without stomata. The cortex is differentiated into outer and inner cortical region. The vascular cylinder is an siphonostele.

The term &quot;brake&quot;, used for members of this genus, is a Middle English word for &quot;fern&quot; from southern England. Its derivation is unclear, and is generally thought to be related to &quot;bracken&quot;, whereby the latter word has been assumed to be a plural, as with &quot;children&quot;, and the former word a back-formation. However it may have a separate derivation.

The Latin genus name &quot;Pteris&quot; refers to the Greek name for fern (also meaning feathery).

==Cultivation and uses==
Some of these ferns are popular in cultivation as houseplants. These smaller species are often called &quot;table ferns&quot;.

&quot;Pteris vittata&quot; (commonly known as brake fern) was discovered to have the ability to &quot;hyperaccumulate&quot; (absorb large amounts of) arsenic from soil. The fern was growing at a central Florida site contaminated with large amounts of copper arsenate in the soil. Dr. Lena Q. Ma of the University of Florida later discovered that it had hyperaccumulated considerable amounts of arsenic from the soil. The discovery may lead to the use of &quot;Pteris vittata&quot; as a potential bioremediation plant.

<doc id="509760" wikidata="Q6768204" url="?curid=509760" title="Mark Green (New York politician)">
<text>Mark Joseph Green (born March 15, 1945) is an American author, former public official, public interest lawyer, and Democratic politician from New York City. Green was New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner from 1990 to 1993 and New York City Public Advocate from 1994 to 2002.

==Early life and education==
Green was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He lived in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, until he was three and then moved to Long Island, first to Elmont, New York, and later Great Neck, New York. Both his parents were Republicans; his father was a lawyer and residential apartment landlord and his mother a public-school teacher.

Green graduated from Great Neck South High School in 1963, from Cornell University in 1967 and in 1970 from Harvard Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review. He has a brother, the prominent realtor Stephen L. Green, founder of SLGreen Realty Corp.

==Political career==
===1960s – 1970s===
In 1967, Green interned for Jacob Javits, and while in law school in the early 1970s, was a &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raider&quot; at Ralph Nader&#x27;s Public Citizen, where he worked on a lawsuit against the Richard Nixon administration after the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. After law school, Green returned to Washington, D.C., and ran the Congress Watch division of the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen from 1977 to 1980. In 1976, he managed former U. S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark&#x27;s campaign for the Senate seat of James Buckley. Clark came in third, behind Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representative Bella Abzug. Moynihan went on to win the office and serve four terms in the Senate.

===1980s===
In 1980, Green returned to New York City and won the Democratic primary election to represent the East Side of Manhattan in the House of Representatives; he lost the race to Republican incumbent Bill Green (no relation). In 1981, Green and songwriter Harry Chapin founded the New Democracy Project, a public policy institute in New York City. Green ran it for a decade. During the 1984 presidential election, he served as chief speechwriter for Democratic candidate Senator Gary Hart, who ran second in the primaries.

In 1986, Green won the Democratic nomination for the Senate against multimillionaire John Dyson, spending just $800,000 to Dyson&#x27;s $6,000,000. Dyson remained on the ballot as the candidate of the Liberal Party. Green lost the general election to Republican incumbent Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, who was supported by then mayor Ed Koch; Green filed a formal ethics complaint in the Senate Ethics Committee against D&#x27;Amato that resulted in D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s being reprimanded by the Senate after media reports that suggested that his nomination as a chair of the Senate Committee of Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs had been tainted by illegal financing of his Senate campaign.

During his Senate campaign, Green refused to accept money from special interest groups&#x27; political action committees (PACs) – which had accounted for 25% of all campaign spending in Congressional campaigns in 1984 – denouncing PACs as &quot;legalized bribery.&quot; His opinion mirrored the stance of Common Cause, the citizens&#x27; lobby that organized to abolish PACs over fears of &quot;special interests&quot; buying votes.

===1990s===

In 1990, Mayor David Dinkins appointed Green Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City. Green was elected as the first New York City Public Advocate in 1993 and reelected in 1997. In that office, he led investigations of HMOs, hospitals, and nursing homes that led to fines by the New York State Attorney General.

A 1994 investigation on the Bell Regulations (&quot;Libby Zion Law&quot;) to limit resident working hours and requiring physician supervision and a follow-up study prompted the New York State Department of Health to crack down on hospitals. Green led an effort against tobacco advertising aimed at children, enacting a law banning cigarette vending machines, and released a series of exposés and legal actions against tobacco advertising targeting children—concluding that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was engaged in &quot;commercial child abuse&quot;—that culminated in a 1997 Federal Trade Commission decision that ended the Joe Camel ads.

As public advocate, Green first proposed the 311 complaint help line that Mayor Mike Bloomberg later implemented. He wrote laws that matched small donations with multiple city funds, created the Voter Commission, upheld the legality of the Independent Budget Office, barred stores from charging women more than men for the same services, and prohibited companies from firing female employees merely because they were victims of domestic violence. He organized the mayors of 20 American cities, under the auspices of Mayor Dinkins, to persuade the French manufacturer of RU-486 (mifipristone) to ignore right-wing opposition to this &quot;abortion pill&quot; and begin importing it into the U.S., which happened after he worked with President Clinton early in his term to get the FDA to approve of this non-medical aborticfacient. And he started the city&#x27;s first web site, NYC.gov, which he later gifted to City Hall, where it is still in use.

One of Green&#x27;s highest-profile accomplishments was a lawsuit to obtain information about racial profiling in Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s police force. As Green told the &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot;, &quot;We sued Mayor Giuliani because he was in deep denial about racial profiling. [After winning the case, we] released an investigation showing a pattern of unpunished misconduct ... [and] the rate that police with substantiated complaints are punished rose from 25 percent to 75 percent.&quot; Green was reportedly one of the first public officials to draw attention to racial profiling by the NYPD.

Green ran for the U.S. Senate again in 1998, when D&#x27;Amato was seeking a fourth term. Green finished third in the Democratic primary behind the winner, U.S. Representative Charles Schumer, and 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro. 

In the 2000 campaign, Green praised Nader&#x27;s work as a consumer advocate but endorsed Democratic nominee Al Gore, who narrowly lost the election to George W. Bush. In 2000, he assisted the successful Senate campaign of First Lady Hillary Clinton, coining the phrase &quot;Listening Tour&quot; to help guide Clinton through a state she hadn&#x27;t previously lived in. In 2004, Green co-chaired Senator John Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign in New York; he also advised Bill Clinton in his successful 1992 New York presidential primary, later crediting Green with his successful strategy of campaigning against Gov. Jerry Brown&#x27;s proposed regressive sales tax as anti-middle class.

===2001 campaign for mayor===
In 2001 Green ran for mayor of New York City and won the Democratic nomination but lost to Republican nominee Michael Bloomberg 50%–48% in the closest NYC mayoral election in a century. Green narrowly defeated Fernando Ferrer in the primary, surviving a negative contest that divided the party. The two other candidates were Council Speaker Peter Vallone and City Comptroller Alan Hevesi.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks occurred on the morning of the Democratic primary and contributed to Green&#x27;s loss. Bloomberg spent an unprecedented $74 million on his campaign, especially on TV ads and direct mail. Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was suddenly extremely popular, endorsed Bloomberg.

&quot;The Economist&quot; wrote, &quot;The billionaire businessman [Bloomberg] is usually seen as one of the post–September 11th winners (if such a word can be so used): he would probably have lost the mayoralty to Mark Green, a leftish Democrat, had the terrorist strike not happened. Yet it is also worth noting that his election probably spared New York City a turbulent period of score-settling over Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s legacy.&quot; Chris Smith wrote in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; in 2011, &quot;Many old-school Democrats believe that Bloomberg&#x27;s 2001 victory over Mark Green was a terrorist-provoked, money-soaked aberration.&quot;

The Ferrer campaign criticized Green for the actions of supporters in the runoff that were construed as racist, involving literature with &quot;New York Post&quot; caricatures of Ferrer and Al Sharpton distributed in white enclaves of Brooklyn and Staten Island. Green said he had nothing to do with the dissemination of the literature. An investigation by the district attorney of Kings County, New York, Charles J. Hynes, came to the conclusion that &quot;Mark Green had no knowledge of these events, and that when he learned of them, he repeatedly denounced the distribution of this literature and sought to find out who had engaged in it.&quot;

The incident kept Ferrer from endorsing Green and is thought to have diminished minority turnout in the general election, which helped Bloomberg win in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. Green wrote an article about the campaign a decade later in the 9/11 anniversary issue of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;. He reported that Bloomberg told him in 2002 that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have won&quot; without Ferrer&#x27;s late campaign opposition to Green.

===2006 campaign for New York Attorney General===

Green ran in the Democratic primary for New York State Attorney General in 2006. He faced former HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, former White House Staff Secretary Sean Patrick Maloney, and former lieutenant governor candidate Charles King in the primary. He held several endorsements of note, including former NYC Mayor David Dinkins, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women (NOW), the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

On September 12, 2006, Green lost to Andrew Cuomo in his bid to secure the Democratic nomination to succeed then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. 

===2009 campaign for public advocate===

On February 10, 2009, Green announced that he would again run for the office of Public Advocate. His policy director was Benjamin Kallos (who later was elected to the New York City Council), with whom he worked on &quot;100 Ideas for a Better City&quot;.

As one of the top two finishers in the Democratic primary, Green qualified for the September 29 runoff, but lost to City Councilmember Bill de Blasio who went on to win the mayoralty in 2013.

<doc id="509763" wikidata="Q726313" url="?curid=509763" title="Jim Douglas">
<text>James Holley Douglas (born June 21, 1951) is an American politician from the state of Vermont. A Republican, he served as the 80th governor of Vermont from 2003 to 2011. On August 27, 2009, Douglas announced that he would not seek re-election for a fifth term in 2010. He left the office in January 2011.

On January 6, 2011, Douglas became an executive in residence at Middlebury College where he taught a 24 student course titled &quot;Vermont Government and Politics&quot;. Douglas is the interim director of the Vermont Historical Society.

Douglas currently serves on the Governors&#x27; Council of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C.

==Early career==
Douglas was born in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1968, he graduated from East Longmeadow High School in the town of East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, where he had been active in the College Republicans, eventually becoming chairman. At Middlebury College, Douglas was a Russian studies major. Vermont maintained a sister-state relationship with the Republic of Karelia, Russia until it was broken by Governor Phil Scott in March 2022 as protest against the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. While influenced by Douglas, this relationship was started in 1991 under the governorship of Madeleine Kunin.

In November 1972, Douglas was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives, where he became the House Majority Leader during his third two-year term at the age of 25. He left the Vermont General Assembly in 1979, afterwards serving as a top aide to Governor Richard A. Snelling. Douglas was elected Secretary of State in November 1980, a post which he held until 1992. That year he sought election to the U.S. Senate, but was defeated by Democratic incumbent Patrick Leahy.

==Vermont State Treasurer==
During his tenure as Vermont State Treasurer, Democrat Paul W. Ruse Jr. was criticized for being too friendly with financial services firms that had an interest in matters handled by the state treasurer, including accepting campaign contributions from them, and appearing in an advertisement for one. Because of the controversy, in 1994 Ruse decided not to run for reelection. This decision was not widely known; Ruse stated that he withheld his decision not to run so that Ed Flanagan, the incumbent Vermont State Auditor, would not run for treasurer. Flanagan and Ruse had been involved in a behind the scenes dispute over details of an auditor&#x27;s report about the treasurer&#x27;s office; Flanagan disclaimed any interest in the treasurer&#x27;s post.

As a result of Ruse&#x27;s decision not to run again, only Douglas had filed as a major party candidate for treasurer; in the absence of a Democratic candidate, Douglas won the Democratic nomination by write-in vote. In the general election, Douglas faced only token opposition, and received over 91% of the votes.

Ruse&#x27;s deputy had retired in October 1994. After Douglas won the treasurer&#x27;s election, Ruse offered him the deputy&#x27;s position so that Douglas would have an opportunity to learn the workings of the treasurer&#x27;s office. Douglas accepted, and served as deputy state treasurer from November 1994 until beginning his term as treasurer in January 1995. Douglas was reelected in 1996, 1998 and 2000.

==Governor of Vermont==

In the 2002 gubernatorial election to succeed five-term Governor Howard Dean, Douglas achieved a plurality over Democratic Lieutenant Governor Doug Racine, 45 to 42%. The Vermont constitution requires that the legislature select the governor if no candidate receives over 50%. The Vermont General Assembly almost always chooses the candidate who won a plurality, and Racine did not contest the results. In January 2003, the legislature selected Douglas by a vote of 159 to 16. Douglas won reelection to a second 2-year term in 2004, defeating Democrat Peter Clavelle, 59 to 38%.

In early 2005, Douglas announced that he would not run against Democratic-leaning independent Jim Jeffords in the 2006 Senate race. In April 2005, Jeffords announced that he would not seek re-election, which led to speculation that Douglas would throw his hat into the ring against Vermont independent Congressman Bernie Sanders, who had announced his candidacy for the seat. On April 30, Douglas announced again that he would not seek Jeffords&#x27; seat, and simultaneously announced that he would run for re-election for governor in 2006. Many pundits believed that Douglas was the only Republican who could possibly defeat Sanders, and his decision to run for governor effectively handed the open Senate seat to Sanders. Douglas was re-elected governor with 57% of the vote over Democrat Scudder Parker.

On May 22, 2007, Governor Douglas signed a landmark civil rights bill banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity by employers, financial institutions, housing, public accommodations, and other contexts. After the Vermont Human Rights Commission recommended that Governor Douglas veto a similar bill in 2006, Douglas worked with legislators to craft a new bill in 2007. This bill passed both chambers of the legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support. Douglas decided to stand for re-election in 2008 and ran unopposed in the Republican primary on September 9, 2008. His principal challengers in the general election were Independent/Progressive Anthony Pollina, and Democrat Gaye Symington. Douglas won a fourth term with nearly 54% of the vote. Although that was his lowest percentage since his initial narrow victory over Doug Racine, he bested his closest challenge, Pollina, by 32%.

Douglas became the first governor to meet with President Barack Obama in the White House on February 2, 2009. He also served as Chairman of the National Governors Association from 2009 to 2010. On April 6, 2009, Douglas vetoed a bill allowing marriage for same-sex couples in Vermont. Democrats in the Vermont House and Senate overrode the veto with a supermajority the next day, marking the first time Douglas had been overridden during his tenure. On June 2, 2009, Democrats in the Vermont House and Senate voted to override Douglas&#x27;s veto of the Vermont state budget.

On August 27, 2009, Douglas announced that he would not seek re-election in 2010. In early 2010, Douglas became the first American political leader to be appointed to the National Order of Quebec (&quot;L&#x27;Ordre National du Quebec&quot; in French), receiving the insignia of an Officer of the order from Premier Jean Charest at a ceremony at the National Assembly of Quebec. He was recognized for strengthening Vermont&#x27;s historical bonds with Quebec and making improved relations with the province a priority of his governorship. On June 17, 2010, his approval rating stood at 65%.

===Cabinet and administration===
==Post-gubernatorial career==
Douglas was succeeded as Governor by Democrat Peter Shumlin.

After leaving office Douglas became an Executive in Residence at Middlebury College and authored a memoir, which was published in late 2012. On July 29, 2015, Douglas was named the interim director of the Vermont Historical Society.

<doc id="509766" wikidata="Q462778" url="?curid=509766" title="Insular area">
<text>In the law of the United States, an insular area is a U.S.-associated jurisdiction that is not part of a U.S. state or the District of Columbia. This includes fourteen U.S. territories administered under U.S. sovereignty, as well as three sovereign states each with a Compact of Free Association with the United States. The term also may be used to refer to the previous status of the Swan Islands, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, as well as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands when it existed.

Three of the U.S. territories are in the Caribbean Sea, eleven are in the Pacific Ocean, and all three freely associated states are also in the Pacific. Two additional Caribbean territories are disputed and administered by Colombia.

Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution grants to the United States Congress the responsibility of overseeing the territories. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions known as the Insular Cases created a distinction between &quot;incorporated territories&quot;, where the full Constitution of the United States applies, and &quot;unincorporated territories&quot;, where only basic protections apply. The only current incorporated territory, Palmyra Atoll, is uninhabited.

A U.S. territory is considered &quot;organized&quot; when the U.S. Congress passes an organic act for it. Three of the U.S. territories with a permanent non-military population have constitutions, and all five have locally elected territorial legislatures and executives, and some degree of political autonomy. Four of the five are &quot;organized&quot;, but American Samoa is technically &quot;unorganized&quot; and subject to the direct jurisdiction of the Office of Insular Affairs.

== History ==
The first insular areas that the United States occupied were Baker Island, Howland Island and Navassa Island (1857) then Johnston Atoll and Jarvis Island (both in 1858) would be claimed. After the Spanish–American War in 1898, several territories were taken that are still under U.S. sovereignty (Puerto Rico and Guam, both in 1898). Palmyra Atoll was annexed along with the Republic of Hawaii (formerly a Kingdom) that same year. American Samoa was reclaimed the following year (1899). In 1917, at the height of World War I, Denmark sold the Danish Virgin Islands to the United States.

The U.S. Navy annexed Kingman Reef in 1922. Spain had sold the Northern Mariana Islands to Germany in 1899. The islands passed to Japan, which in turn lost them to the United States in 1945 after the end of World War II.

The Marshall Islands became self-governing in 1979 and fully independent along with the Federated States of Micronesia in 1986. Palau achieved independence in 1994. The three countries maintain sovereignty with free association status with the United States, which provides them with defense assistance and economic resources.

===Timeline===

==Citizenship==
Congress has extended citizenship rights by birth to all inhabited territories except American Samoa, and these citizens may vote and run for office in any U.S. jurisdiction in which they are residents. The people of American Samoa are U.S. nationals by place of birth, or they are U.S. citizens by parentage, or naturalization after residing in a State for three months. Nationals are free to move around and seek employment within the United States without immigration restrictions, but cannot vote or hold office outside American Samoa.

==Political representation==
Each of the five inhabited areas: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States Virgin Islands, has a non-voting member in the United States House of Representatives.

==Taxation==
Residents of the five major populated insular areas do not pay U.S. federal income taxes but are required to pay other U.S. federal taxes such as import and export taxes, federal commodity taxes, Social Security taxes, etc. Individuals working for the federal government pay federal income taxes while all residents are required to pay federal payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare). According to IRS Publication 570, income from other U.S. Pacific Ocean insular areas (Howland, Baker, Jarvis, Johnston, Midway, Palmyra, and Wake Islands, and Kingman Reef) is fully taxable as income of United States residents.

Puerto Rico is inside the main domestic customs territory of the United States, but the other insular areas are outside it; tariff treatment varies (see ).

==Associated states==
The U.S. State Department and the U.S. Code also use the term &quot;insular area&quot; to refer not only to territories under the sovereignty of the United States, but also those independent nations that have signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States. While these nations participate in many otherwise domestic programs, and full responsibility for their military defense rests with the United States, they are legally distinct from the United States and their inhabitants are neither U.S. citizens nor nationals.

== Current insular areas by status ==
The following islands, or island groups, are considered insular areas:

=== Incorporated organized territories ===
&quot;None&quot;

=== Incorporated unorganized territory ===
One (uninhabited)

* Palmyra Atoll – U.S. Territory of Palmyra Island (mostly owned by the Federal Government and The Nature Conservancy; administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

=== Unincorporated organized territories ===
Four (inhabited)

* (organized under the Guam Organic Act of 1950)
* (Commonwealth, organized under the 1975 Covenant)
* (Commonwealth, organized under the 1900 Foraker Act)
* (organized under the 1954 Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands)

* 

After achieving independence from the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, these states are no longer under U.S. sovereignty and thus not considered part of the United States. Some programs in these states are administered by the U.S. Office of Insular Affairs, along with other federal entities such as the Department of Defense.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Busch (22 January 1900 – 8 June 1980) was a German singer and actor.

==Biography==
Busch was born to a Kiel worker family. He started in life as a shipyard worker before he decided to make use of his acting and singing talent.

Busch first rose to prominence as an interpreter of political songs, particularly those of Kurt Tucholsky, in the Berlin Kabarett scene of the 1920s. He starred in the original 1928 production of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, as well as the subsequent 1931 film by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. He also appeared in the movie &quot;Kuhle Wampe&quot;.

A lifelong communist, Busch fled Nazi Germany in 1933, accompanied by his wife, Eva Busch, and with the Gestapo on his heels, initially settling in the Netherlands. By 1938 they had divorced, without acrimony, as their lives diverged. Eva settled in Paris while Ernst initially made his home in the Soviet Union where he worked with Gustav von Wangenheim on the 1935 film &quot;Kämpfer&quot; (&quot;Fighters&quot;). In 1937 he joined the International Brigades to fight against the nationalists in Spain. His wartime songs were then recorded and broadcast by Radio Barcelona and Radio Madrid. After the Spanish Republic fell to General Franco, Busch migrated to Belgium where he was interned during the German occupation and later imprisoned in Camp Gurs, France and Berlin. Freed by the Red Army in 1945, he settled in East Berlin, where he acted in the first play to be produced in the American-occupied zone, Robert Ardrey&#x27;s &quot;Thunder Rock&quot;. He would go on to start his own record label and work with Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator at the &quot;Berliner Ensemble&quot;. A beloved figure in the German Democratic Republic, he is best remembered for his performance in the title role of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Life of Galileo&quot; and his recordings of workers songs, including many written by Hanns Eisler. He also lent his voice to a memorable recording of &quot;Peat Bog Soldiers&quot;.

<doc id="509785" wikidata="Q1352230" url="?curid=509785" title="Territories of the United States">
<text>Territories of the United States are sub-national administrative divisions and dependent territories overseen by the federal government of the United States. The American territories differ from the U.S. states and Indian reservations in that they are not sovereign entities. In contrast, each state has a sovereignty separate from that of the federal government and each federally recognized Native American tribe possesses limited tribal sovereignty as a &quot;dependent sovereign nation&quot;. Territories are classified by incorporation and whether they have an &quot;organized&quot; government established by an organic act passed by the Congress. American territories are under American sovereignty and may be treated as part of the U.S. &quot;proper&quot; in some ways and not others (i.e., territories belong to, but are not considered part of the U.S.). Unincorporated territories in particular are not considered to be integral parts of the U.S., and the U.S. Constitution applies only partially in those territories.

The U.S. administers three territories in the Caribbean Sea and eleven in the Pacific Ocean. Five territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) are permanently inhabited, unincorporated territories; the other nine are small islands, atolls, and reefs with no native (or permanent) population. Of the nine, only one is classified as an incorporated territory (Palmyra Atoll). Two additional territories (Bajo Nuevo Bank and Serranilla Bank) are claimed by the U.S. but administered by Colombia. Historically, territories were created to administer newly acquired land, and most eventually attained statehood. The most recent territories to become U.S. states were Alaska on January 3, 1959, and Hawaii on August 21, 1959.

Politically and economically, the territories are underdeveloped. Residents of U.S. territories cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have only non-voting representation in the U.S. Congress. According to 2012 data, territorial telecommunications and other infrastructure are generally inferior to that of the continental U.S. and Hawaii. Poverty rates are higher in the territories than in the states.
==Organized vs. unorganized territories==


===Definition===
Organized territories are lands under federal sovereignty (but not part of any state or the federal district) which were given a measure of self-governance by Congress through an organic act subject to the Congress&#x27;s plenary powers under the territorial clause of the Constitution&#x27;s Article Four, section 3.

===Historical practice===
The term &quot;unorganized&quot; was historically applied either to a newly acquired region not yet constituted as an organized incorporated territory (e.g. the Louisiana Purchase prior to the establishment of Orleans Territory and the District of Louisiana), or to a region previously part of an organized incorporated territory left &quot;unorganized&quot; after part of it had been organized and achieved the requirements for statehood (e.g. a large portion of Missouri Territory became unorganized territory for several years after its southeastern section became the state of Missouri). The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 created the Kansas and Nebraska Territories, bringing organized government to the region once again. The creation of Kansas and Nebraska left the Indian Territory as the only unorganized territory in the Great Plains. In 1858, the western part of the Minnesota Territory became unorganized when it was not included in the new state of Minnesota; this area was organized in 1861 as part of the Dakota Territory. In 1890, the western half of the Indian Territory was organized as Oklahoma Territory. The eastern half remained unorganized until 1907, when it was joined with Oklahoma Territory to form the State of Oklahoma. Additionally, the Department of Alaska was unorganized from its acquisition in 1867 from Russia until organized as the District of Alaska in 1884; it was organized as Alaska Territory in 1912. Hawaii was also unorganized from the time of its annexation by the U.S. in 1898 until organized as Hawaii Territory in 1900.

Regions that have been admitted as states under the United States Constitution in addition to the original thirteen were, most often, prior to admission, territories or parts of territories of this kind. As the United States grew, the most populous parts of the organized territory would achieve statehood. Some territories existed only a short time before becoming states, while others remained territories for decades. The shortest-lived was Alabama Territory at two years, while New Mexico Territory and Hawaii Territory both lasted more than 50 years.

Of the 50 states, 31 were once part of an organized, incorporated U.S. territory. In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states never were: Kentucky, Maine, and West Virginia were each separated from an existing state; Texas and Vermont were both sovereign states (&quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty for Vermont, as the region was claimed by New York) when they entered the Union; and California was part of unorganized land ceded to the United States by Mexico in 1848 at the end of the Mexican–American War.

===Existing status===
All of the five major U.S. territories are permanently inhabited and have locally elected territorial legislatures and executives and some degree of political autonomy. Four of the five are &quot;organized&quot;, but American Samoa is technically &quot;unorganized&quot;. All of the U.S. territories without permanent non-military populations are unorganized.

==Federal administration==
The Office of Insular Affairs coordinates federal administration of the U.S. territories and freely associated states, except for Puerto Rico.

On March 3, 1849, the last day of the 30th Congress, a bill was passed to create the U.S. Department of the Interior to take charge of the internal affairs of &quot;United States territory&quot;. The Interior Department has a wide range of responsibilities (which include the regulation of territorial governments, the basic responsibilities for public lands, and other various duties).

In contrast to similarly named Departments in other countries, the United States Department of the Interior is not responsible for local government or for civil administration except in the cases of Indian reservations, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and island dependencies administered by the Office of Insular Affairs.
==Permanently inhabited territories==
The U.S. has five permanently inhabited territories: Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in the North Pacific Ocean, and American Samoa in the South Pacific Ocean. American Samoa is in the Southern Hemisphere, while the other four are in the Northern Hemisphere. In 2020, their combined population was about 3.62 million, over 90% of which is accounted for by Puerto Rico alone.

People born in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands acquire U.S. citizenship by birth, and foreign nationals residing there may apply for U.S. citizenship by naturalization. People born in American Samoa acquire U.S. nationality but not U.S. citizenship by birth if they do not have a U.S. citizen parent. U.S. nationals without U.S. citizenship may hold U.S. passports and reside in any part of the United States without restriction. However, to become U.S. citizens they must apply for naturalization, like foreigners, and may only do so while residing in parts of the United States other than American Samoa. Foreign nationals residing in American Samoa cannot apply for U.S. citizenship or U.S. nationality at all.

Each territory is self-governing with three branches of government, including a locally elected governor and a territorial legislature. Each territory elects a non-voting member (a non-voting resident commissioner in the case of Puerto Rico) to the U.S. House of Representatives. Although they cannot vote on the passage of legislation, they can introduce legislation, have floor privileges to address the house, be members of and vote in committees, are assigned offices and staff funding, and may nominate constituents from their territories to the Army, Naval, Air Force and Merchant Marine academies.

As of the 118th Congress, the territories are represented by Aumua Amata Radewagen (R) of American Samoa, James Moylan (R) of Guam, Gregorio Sablan (D) of Northern Mariana Islands, Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PNP) of Puerto Rico and Stacey Plaskett (D) of U.S. Virgin Islands. The District of Columbia&#x27;s delegate is Eleanor Holmes Norton (D); like the district, the territories have no vote in Congress and no representation in the Senate. Additionally, the Cherokee Nation has delegate-elect Kimberly Teehee, who has not been seated by Congress.

Every four years, U.S. political parties nominate presidential candidates at conventions which include delegates from the territories. U.S. citizens living in the territories can vote for presidential candidates in these primary elections but not in the general election.

The territorial capitals are Pago Pago (American Samoa), Hagåtña (Guam), Saipan (Northern Mariana Islands), San Juan (Puerto Rico) and Charlotte Amalie (U.S. Virgin Islands). Their governors are Lemanu Peleti Mauga (American Samoa), Lou Leon Guerrero (Guam), Ralph Torres (Northern Mariana Islands), Pedro Pierluisi (Puerto Rico) and Albert Bryan (U.S. Virgin Islands).

Among the inhabited territories, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available only in the Northern Mariana Islands; however, in 2019 a U.S. judge ruled that the federal government&#x27;s denial of SSI benefits to residents of Puerto Rico is unconstitutional. This ruling was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, allowing for the exclusion of territories from such programs. In the decision, the court explained that the exemption of island residents from most federal income taxes provides a &quot;rational basis&quot; for their exclusion from eligibility for SSI payments.

American Samoa is the only U.S. territory with its own immigration system (a system separate from the United States immigration system). American Samoa also has a communal land system in which 90% of the land is communally owned; ownership is based on Samoan ancestry.


===History===
* American Samoa: territory since 1900; after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War, the Samoan Islands were divided into two regions. The U.S. took control of the eastern half of the islands. In 1900, the Treaty of Cession of Tutuila took effect. The Manuʻa islands became part of American Samoa in 1904, and Swains Island became part of American Samoa in 1925. Congress ratified American Samoa&#x27;s treaties in 1929. For 51 years, the U.S. Navy controlled the territory. American Samoa is locally self-governing under a constitution last revised in 1967. The first elected governor of American Samoa was in 1977, and the first non-voting member of Congress was in 1981. By jus soli, people born in American Samoa are U.S. nationals, but not U.S. citizens. American Samoa is technically unorganized, and its main island is Tutuila.
* Guam: territory since 1899, acquired at the end of the Spanish–American War. Guam is the home of Naval Base Guam and Andersen Air Force Base. It was organized under the Guam Organic Act of 1950, which granted U.S. citizenship to Guamanians and gave Guam a local government. In 1968, the act was amended to permit the election of a governor.
* Northern Mariana Islands: A commonwealth since 1986, the Northern Mariana Islands together with Guam were part of the Spanish Empire until 1899 when the Northern Marianas were sold to the German Empire after the Spanish–American War. Beginning in 1919, they were administered by Japan as a League of Nations mandate until the islands were captured by the United States in the Battle of Saipan and Battle of Tinian (June–August 1944) and the surrender of Aguigan (September 1945) during World War II. They became part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947, administered by the United States as U.N. trustee. The other constituents of the TTPI were Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. Following failed efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to reunify Guam and the Northern Marianas, a covenant to establish the Northern Mariana Islands as a commonwealth in political union with the United States was negotiated by representatives of both political bodies; it was approved by Northern Mariana Islands voters in 1975, and came into force on March 24, 1976. In accordance with the covenant, the Northern Mariana Islands constitution partially took effect on January 9, 1978, and became fully effective on November 4, 1986. In 1986, the Northern Mariana Islands formally left U.N. trusteeship. The abbreviations &quot;CNMI&quot; and &quot;NMI&quot; are both used in the commonwealth. Most residents in the Northern Mariana Islands live on Saipan, the main island.
* Puerto Rico: unincorporated territory since 1899; Puerto Rico was acquired at the end of the Spanish–American War, and has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Since 1917, Puerto Ricans have been granted U.S. citizenship. Puerto Rico was organized under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 (Public Law 600). In November 2008, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that a series of Congressional actions have had the cumulative effect of changing Puerto Rico&#x27;s status from unincorporated to incorporated. The issue is proceeding through the courts, however, and the U.S. government still refers to Puerto Rico as unincorporated. A Puerto Rican attorney has called the island &quot;semi-sovereign&quot;. Puerto Rico has a statehood movement, whose goal is to make the territory the 51st state. See also Political status of Puerto Rico.
* U.S. Virgin Islands: purchased by the U.S. from Denmark in 1917 and organized under the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands in 1954. U.S. citizenship was granted in 1927. The main islands are Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix.

===Statistics===
Except for Guam, the inhabited territories lost population in 2020. Although the territories have higher poverty rates than the mainland U.S., they have high Human Development Indexes. Four of the five territories have another official language, in addition to English.

The territories do not have administrative counties. The U.S. Census Bureau counts Puerto Rico&#x27;s 78 municipalities, the U.S. Virgin Islands&#x27; three main islands, all of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands&#x27; four municipalities, and American Samoa&#x27;s three districts and two atolls as county equivalents. The Census Bureau also counts each of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands as county equivalents.

For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau has a defined area called the &quot;Island Areas&quot; which consists of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (every major territory except Puerto Rico). The U.S. Census Bureau often treats Puerto Rico as its own entity or groups it with the states and D.C. (for example, Puerto Rico has a QuickFacts page just like the states and D.C.) Puerto Rico data is collected annually in American Community Survey estimates (just like the states), but data for the other territories is collected only once every ten years.

===Governments and legislatures===


The five major inhabited territories contain the following governments and legislatures:

==== Political party status ====
The following is the political party status of the governments of the U.S. territories following completion of the 2024 United States elections. Instances where local and national party affiliation differs, the national affiliation is listed second. Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have unicameral territorial legislatures.


===Courts===
Each of the five major territories has its own local court system:

* High Court of American Samoa
* Supreme Court of Guam
* Supreme Court of the Northern Mariana Islands
* Supreme Court of Puerto Rico
* Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands

Of the five major territories, only Puerto Rico has an Article III federal district court (i.e., equivalent to the courts in the fifty states); it became an Article III court in 1966. This means that, unlike other U.S. territories, federal judges in Puerto Rico have life tenure. Federal courts in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands are Article IV territorial courts. The following is a list of federal territorial courts, plus Puerto Rico&#x27;s court:
* District Court of Guam (Ninth Circuit)
* District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands (Ninth Circuit)
* District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (not a territorial court) (First Circuit)
* District Court of the Virgin Islands (Third Circuit)

American Samoa does not have a federal territorial court, and so federal matters in American Samoa are sent to either the District court of Hawaii or the District court of the District of Columbia. American Samoa is the only permanently inhabited region of the United States with no federal court.

===Demographics===
While the U.S. mainland is majority non-Hispanic White, this is not the case for the U.S. territories. In 2010, American Samoa&#x27;s population was 92.6% Pacific Islander (including 88.9% Samoan); Guam&#x27;s population was 49.3% Pacific Islander (including 37.3% Chamorro) and 32.2% Asian (including 26.3% Filipino); the population of the Northern Mariana Islands was 34.9% Pacific Islander and 49.9% Asian; and the population of the U.S. Virgin Islands was 76.0% African American. In 2019, Puerto Rico&#x27;s population was 98.9% Hispanic or Latino, 67.4% white, and 0.8% non-Hispanic white.

Throughout the 2010s, the U.S. territories (overall) lost population. The combined population of the five inhabited territories was 4,100,594 in 2010, and 3,569,284 in 2020.

The U.S. territories have high religiosity rates—American Samoa has the highest religiosity rate in the United States (99.3% religious and 98.3% Christian).

===Economies===
The economies of the U.S. territories vary from Puerto Rico, which has a GDP of $104.989 billion in 2019, to American Samoa, which has a GDP of $636 million in 2018. In 2018, Puerto Rico exported about $18 billion in goods, with the Netherlands as the largest destination.

Guam&#x27;s GDP shrank by 0.3% in 2018, the GDP of the Northern Mariana Islands shrank by 19.6% in 2018, Puerto Rico&#x27;s GDP grew by 1.18% in 2019, and the U.S. Virgin Islands&#x27; GDP grew by 1.5% in 2018. In 2017, American Samoa&#x27;s GDP shrank by 5.8%, but then grew by 2.2% in 2018.

American Samoa has the lowest per capita income in the United States—it has a per capita income comparable to that of Botswana. In 2010, American Samoa&#x27;s per capita income was $6,311. As of 2010, the Manu&#x27;a District in American Samoa had a per capita income of $5,441, the lowest of any county or county-equivalent in the United States. In 2018, Puerto Rico had a median household income of $20,166 (lower than the median household income of any state). Also in 2018, Comerío Municipality, Puerto Rico had a median household income of $12,812 (the lowest median household income of any populated county or county-equivalent in the U.S.) Guam has much higher incomes (Guam had a median household income of $48,274 in 2010.)
==Minor Outlying Islands==
The United States Minor Outlying Islands are small uninhabited islands, atolls, and reefs. Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island are in the Pacific Ocean while Navassa Island is in the Caribbean Sea. The additional claimed territories of Bajo Nuevo Bank and Serranilla Bank are also located in the Caribbean Sea. Palmyra Atoll (formally known as the United States Territory of Palmyra Island) is the only incorporated territory, a status it has maintained since Hawaii became a state in 1959. All are uninhabited except for Midway Atoll, whose approximately 40 inhabitants (as of 2004) were employees of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and their services provider; Palmyra Atoll, whose population varies from four to 20 Nature Conservancy and Fish and Wildlife staff and researchers; and Wake Island, which has a population of about 100 military personnel and civilian employees.
The two-letter abbreviation for the islands collectively is &quot;UM&quot;.

The status of several islands is disputed. Navassa Island is disputed by Haiti, Wake Island is disputed by the Marshall Islands, Swains Island (a part of American Samoa) is disputed by Tokelau, and Bajo Nuevo Bank and Serranilla Bank are both administered by Colombia, whose claim is disputed by the U.S. and Jamaica.

===Claimed territories===
The following two territories are claimed by multiple countries (including the United States) and are not included in ISO 3166-2:UM. However, they are sometimes grouped with the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands. According to the GAO, &quot;the United States conducts maritime law enforcement operations in and around Serranilla Bank and Bajo Nuevo [Bank] consistent with U.S. sovereignty claims.&quot;


==Incorporated vs. unincorporated territories==



Pursuant to a series of Supreme Court rulings, Congress decides whether a territory is incorporated or unincorporated. The U.S. Constitution applies to each incorporated territory (including its local government and inhabitants) as it applies to the local governments and residents of a state. Incorporated territories are considered to be integral parts of the U.S., rather than possessions.

In unincorporated territories, &quot;fundamental rights apply as a matter of law, but other constitutional rights are not available&quot;, raising concerns about how citizens in these territories can influence politics in the United States. Selected constitutional provisions apply, depending on congressional acts and judicial rulings according to U.S. constitutional practice, local tradition, and law. As a result, these territories are often considered colonies of the United States.

All modern inhabited territories under the control of the federal government can be considered as part of the &quot;United States&quot; for purposes of law as defined in specific legislation. However, the judicial term &quot;unincorporated&quot; was coined to legitimize the late-19th-century territorial acquisitions without citizenship and their administration without constitutional protections temporarily until Congress made other provisions. The case law allowed Congress to impose discriminatory tax regimes with the effect of a protective tariff upon territorial regions which were not domestic states. In 2022, the United States Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Vaello Madero&quot; held that the territorial clause of the constitution allowed wide congressional latitude in mandating &quot;reasonable&quot; tax and benefit schemes in Puerto Rico and the other territories, which are different from the states, but did not address the incorporated/unincorporated distinction. In a concurrence with the court&#x27;s overall ruling on the propriety of the differential tax structures, one of the justices opined that it was time to overrule the doctrine of unincorporated territories, as wrongly decided and founded in racism; the dissent agreed with this view.

===Insular Cases===
The U.S. Supreme Court, in its 1901–1905 Insular Cases opinions, ruled that the Constitution extended (i.e., of its own force) to the continental territories. The Court also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation, in which the Constitution applies fully to incorporated territories (such as the then-territories of Alaska and Hawaii) and partially in the unincorporated territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and, at the time, the Philippines (which is no longer a U.S. territory).

In the 1901 Supreme Court case &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot;, the Court said that the U.S. Constitution did not fully apply in unincorporated territories because they were inhabited by &quot;alien races&quot;.

The U.S. had no unincorporated territories (also known as overseas possessions or insular areas) until 1856. Congress enacted the Guano Islands Act that year, authorizing the president to take possession of unclaimed islands to mine guano. The U.S. has taken control of (and claimed rights on) many islands and atolls, especially in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, under this law; most have been abandoned. It also has acquired territories since 1856 under other circumstances, such as under the Treaty of Paris (1898) which ended the Spanish–American War. The Supreme Court considered the constitutional position of these unincorporated territories in 1922 in &quot;Balzac v. People of Porto Rico&quot;, and said the following about a U.S. court in Puerto Rico:
In &quot;Glidden Company v. Zdanok&quot;, the Court cited &quot;Balzac&quot; and said about courts in unincorporated territories: &quot;Upon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside the mainland... and to the consular courts established by concessions from foreign countries&quot;. The judiciary determined that incorporation involves express declaration or an implication strong enough to exclude any other view, raising questions about Puerto Rico&#x27;s status.

In 1966, Congress made the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico an Article III district court. This (the only district court in a U.S. territory) sets Puerto Rico apart judicially from the other unincorporated territories, and U.S. district judge Gustavo Gelpí has expressed the opinion that Puerto Rico is no longer unincorporated:

In &quot;Balzac&quot;, the Court defined &quot;implied&quot;:
On June 5, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled 3–0 in &quot;Tuaua v. United States&quot; to deny birthright citizenship to American Samoans, ruling that the guarantee of such citizenship to citizens in the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to unincorporated U.S. territories. In 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the appellate court&#x27;s decision.

In 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the District Court decision in &quot;Segovia v. United States&quot;, which ruled that former Illinois residents living in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands did not qualify to cast overseas ballots according to their last registered address on the U.S. mainland. (Residents of the Northern Marianas and American Samoa, however, were still allowed to cast such ballots.) In October 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the 7th Circuit&#x27;s decision.

On June 15, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled 2–1 in &quot;Fitisemanu v. United States&quot; to deny birthright citizenship to American Samoans and not to overrule the Insular Cases. The court cited Downes and ruled that &quot;neither constitutional text nor Supreme Court precedent&quot; demands that American Samoans should be given automatic birthright citizenship. The case was denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 21, 2022, in the case &quot;United States v. Vaello Madero&quot;, Justice Gorsuch urged the Supreme Court to overrule the Insular Cases when possible as they &quot;rest on a rotten foundation&quot; and called the cases &quot;shameful&quot;.

In analyzing the Insular Cases, Christina Duffy Ponsa (Juris Doctor, Yale Law School, 1998; former law clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer) wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;To be an unincorporated territory is to be caught in limbo: although unquestionably subject to American sovereignty, they are considered part of the United States for certain purposes but not others. Whether they are part of the United States for purposes of the Citizenship Clause remains unresolved. &quot;

===Supreme Court decisions about current territories===
The 2016 Supreme Court case &quot;Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle&quot; ruled that territories do not have their own sovereignty. That year, the Supreme Court declined to rule on a lower-court ruling in &quot;Tuaua v. United States&quot; that American Samoans are not U.S. citizens at birth.

The Supreme Court ruled in 2022 in &quot;United States v. Vaello-Madero&quot; that Congress is not required to extend all benefits to Puerto Ricans, and that the exclusion of Puerto Ricans from the Supplemental Security Income program was constitutional.

===Supreme Court decisions about former territories===

In &quot;Rassmussen v. U.S.&quot;, the Supreme Court quoted from Article III of the 1867 treaty for the purchase of Alaska:

The act of incorporation affects the people of the territory more than the territory itself by extending the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution to them, such as its extension to Puerto Rico in 1947; however, Puerto Rico remains unincorporated.

====Alaska Territory====

&quot;Rassmussen&quot; arose from a criminal conviction by a six-person jury in Alaska under federal law. The court held that Alaska had been incorporated into the U.S. in the treaty of cession with Russia, and the congressional implication was strong enough to exclude any other view:

Concurring justice Henry Brown agreed:

====Florida Territory====

In &quot;Dorr v. U.S.&quot;, the court quoted Chief Justice John Marshall from an earlier case:
In &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot;, the court said: &quot;The same construction was adhered to in the treaty with Spain for the purchase of Florida... the 6th article of which provided that the inhabitants should &#x27;be incorporated into the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution&#x27;.&quot;

====Southwest Territory====

Justice Brown first mentioned incorporation in &quot;Downes&quot;:
====Louisiana Territory====

In &quot;Downes&quot;, the court said:
===Modern Puerto Rico===
Scholars agreed as of 2009 in the &quot;Boston College Law Review&quot;, &quot;Regardless of how Puerto Rico looked in 1901 when the Insular Cases were decided, or in 1922, today, Puerto Rico seems to be the paradigm of an incorporated territory as modern jurisprudence understands that legal term of art&quot;. In November 2008, a district court judge ruled that a sequence of prior Congressional actions had the cumulative effect of changing Puerto Rico&#x27;s status to incorporated. In 2022, the United States Supreme Court held that the territorial clause of the constitution allowed wide congressional latitude in mandating &quot;reasonable&quot; tax and benefit schemes in Puerto Rico and the other territories that are different from the states, but did not address the incorporated/unincorporated distinction.

==Flora and fauna==

The territories of the United States have many plant and animal species found nowhere else in the United States. All U.S. territories have tropical climates and ecosystems.

===Forests===

The USDA says the following about the U.S. territories (plus Hawaii):
Forests in the U.S. territories are vulnerable to invasive species and new housing developments. El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico is the only tropical rain forest in the United States National Forest system.

American Samoa has 80.84% forest cover and the Northern Mariana Islands has 80.37% forest cover—these are among the highest forest cover percentages in the United States (only Maine and New Hampshire are higher).

===Birds===

U.S. territories have many bird species that are endemic (not found in any other location).

Introduction of the invasive brown tree snake has harmed Guam&#x27;s native bird population—nine of twelve endemic species have become extinct, and the territorial bird (the Guam rail) is extinct in the wild.

Puerto Rico has several endemic bird species, such as the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot, the Puerto Rican flycatcher, and the Puerto Rican spindalis. The Northern Mariana Islands has the Mariana swiftlet, Mariana crow, Tinian monarch and golden white-eye (all endemic). Birds found in American Samoa include the many-colored fruit dove, the blue-crowned lorikeet, and the Samoan starling.

The Wake Island rail (now extinct) was endemic to Wake Island, and the Laysan duck is endemic to Midway Atoll and the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. Palmyra Atoll has the second-largest red-footed booby colony in the world, and Midway Atoll has the largest breeding colony of Laysan albatross in the world.

The American Birding Association currently excludes the U.S. territories from their &quot;ABA Area&quot; checklist.

===Other animals===
American Samoa has several reptile species, such as the Pacific boa (on the island of Ta‘ū) and Pacific slender-toed gecko. American Samoa has only a few mammal species, such as the Pacific (Polynesian) sheath-tailed bat, as well as oceanic mammals such as the Humpback whale. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands also have a small number of mammals, such as the Mariana fruit bat; oceanic mammals include Fraser&#x27;s dolphin and the Sperm whale. The fauna of Puerto Rico includes the common coquí (frog), while the fauna of the U.S. Virgin Islands includes species found in Virgin Islands National Park (including 302 species of fish).

American Samoa has a location called Turtle and Shark which is important in Samoan culture and mythology.
===Protected areas===
There are two National Parks in the U.S. territories: the National Park of American Samoa, and Virgin Islands National Park. The National Park Service also manages War in the Pacific National Historical Park on Guam. There are also National Natural Landmarks, National Wildlife Refuges (such as Guam National Wildlife Refuge), El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument (which includes the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands).

==Public image==
In &quot;The Not-Quite States of America&quot;, his book about the U.S. territories, essayist Doug Mack said:
Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida said about a 2018 bill to make Puerto Rico the 51st state, &quot;The hard truth is that Puerto Rico&#x27;s lack of political power allows Washington to treat Puerto Rico like an afterthought.&quot; According to Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rosselló, &quot;Because we don&#x27;t have political power, because we don&#x27;t have representatives, [no] senators, no vote for president, we are treated as an afterthought.&quot; Rosselló called Puerto Rico the &quot;oldest, most populous colony in the world&quot;.

Rosselló and others have referred to the U.S. territories as American &quot;colonies&quot;. David Vine of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the following: &quot;The people of [the U.S. territories] are all too accustomed to being forgotten except in times of crisis. But being forgotten is not the worst of their problems. They are trapped in a state of third-class citizenship, unable to access full democratic rights because politicians have long favored the military&#x27;s freedom of operation over protecting the freedoms of certain U.S. citizens.&quot; In his article &quot;How the U.S. Has Hidden Its Empire&quot;, Daniel Immerwahr of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes, &quot;The confusion and shoulder-shrugging indifference that mainlanders displayed [toward territories] at the time of Pearl Harbor hasn&#x27;t changed much at all. [...] [Maps of the contiguous U.S.] give [mainlanders] a truncated view of their own history, one that excludes part of their country.&quot; The 2020 U.S. Census excludes non-citizen U.S. nationals in American Samoa—in response to this, Mark Joseph Stern of &quot;Slate&quot; said, &quot;The Census Bureau&#x27;s total exclusion of American Samoans provides a pertinent reminder that, until the courts step in, the federal government will continue to treat these Americans with startling indifference.&quot;

<text>In linear algebra, a square matrix with complex entries is said to be skew-Hermitian or anti-Hermitian if its conjugate transpose is the negative of the original matrix. That is, the matrix formula_1 is skew-Hermitian if it satisfies the relation

where formula_2 denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix formula_1. In component form, this means that

&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

for all indices formula_4 and formula_5, where formula_6 is the element in the formula_4-th row and formula_5-th column of formula_1, and the overline denotes complex conjugation.

Skew-Hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex versions of real skew-symmetric matrices, or as the matrix analogue of the purely imaginary numbers. The set of all skew-Hermitian formula_10 matrices forms the formula_11 Lie algebra, which corresponds to the Lie group U(n). The concept can be generalized to include linear transformations of any complex vector space with a sesquilinear norm.

Note that the adjoint of an operator depends on the scalar product considered on the formula_12 dimensional complex or real space formula_13. If formula_14 denotes the scalar product on formula_15, then saying formula_16 is skew-adjoint means that for all formula_17 one has formula_18.

Imaginary numbers can be thought of as skew-adjoint (since they are like formula_19 matrices), whereas real numbers correspond to self-adjoint operators.

==Example==
For example, the following matrix is skew-Hermitian
formula_20
because
formula_21

==Properties==
* The eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are all purely imaginary (and possibly zero). Furthermore, skew-Hermitian matrices are normal. Hence they are diagonalizable and their eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues must be orthogonal.
* All entries on the main diagonal of a skew-Hermitian matrix have to be pure imaginary; i.e., on the imaginary axis (the number zero is also considered purely imaginary).
* If formula_1 and formula_23 are skew-Hermitian, then is skew-Hermitian for all real scalars formula_24 and formula_25.
* formula_1 is skew-Hermitian &quot;if and only if&quot; formula_27 (or equivalently, formula_28) is Hermitian.
*formula_1 is skew-Hermitian &quot;if and only if&quot; the real part formula_30 is skew-symmetric and the imaginary part formula_31 is symmetric.
* If formula_1 is skew-Hermitian, then formula_33 is Hermitian if formula_34 is an even integer and skew-Hermitian if formula_34 is an odd integer.
* formula_1 is skew-Hermitian if and only if formula_37 for all vectors formula_38.
* If formula_1 is skew-Hermitian, then the matrix exponential formula_40 is unitary.
* The space of skew-Hermitian matrices forms the Lie algebra formula_11 of the Lie group formula_42.

==Decomposition into Hermitian and skew-Hermitian==
* The sum of a square matrix and its conjugate transpose formula_43 is Hermitian.
* The difference of a square matrix and its conjugate transpose formula_44 is skew-Hermitian. This implies that the commutator of two Hermitian matrices is skew-Hermitian.
* An arbitrary square matrix formula_45 can be written as the sum of a Hermitian matrix formula_1 and a skew-Hermitian matrix formula_23: formula_48

<text>Frida is a 2002 American biographical drama film directed by Julie Taymor which depicts the professional and private life of the surrealist Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.

Starring Salma Hayek in an Academy Award–nominated portrayal as Kahlo and Alfred Molina as her husband, Diego Rivera, the film was adapted by Clancy Sigal, Diane Lake, Gregory Nava, Anna Thomas, Antonio Banderas and unofficially by Edward Norton from the 1983 book &quot;Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo&quot; by Hayden Herrera. &quot;Frida&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, and won two Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Best Original Score among six nominations.

==Plot==
In 1925, Frida Kahlo suffers a traumatic accident at the age of 18 on board a wooden-bodied bus that collides with a streetcar. Impaled by a metal pole, the injuries she sustains plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas to paint on.

Once regaining the ability to walk with a cane, Frida visits muralist Diego Rivera, demanding an honest critique of her paintings. Rivera falls in love with her work, and they begin a dysfunctional relationship. When he proposes, she tells him she expects loyalty from him, if not fidelity. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women. At the same time, the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including, in one case, the same woman as Rivera.

The couple travels to New York City in 1934, so Rivera may paint the mural &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;, at the behest of the Rockefeller family, inside Rockefeller Center. While living in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage and travels back to Mexico for her mother&#x27;s funeral. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller; as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera more reluctant.

Kahlo&#x27;s sister, Cristina, moves in with them at their San Ángel studio home as Rivera&#x27;s assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers Rivera is sleeping with her. Leaving him, she subsequently sinks into alcoholism after moving back to her family&#x27;s Coyoacán home. They reunite during a &quot;Día de los Muertos&quot; celebration where he asks her to welcome and house Leon Trotsky, who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. Trotsky expresses his love for Kahlo&#x27;s work during an excursion to Teotihuacan, and they begin an affair. Soon, Trotsky&#x27;s wife learns of the affair, forcing the couple to leave the safety of Kahlo&#x27;s home.

Kahlo leaves for Paris when Diego realizes she was unfaithful to him with Trotsky. However, Rivera had little problem with Kahlo&#x27;s other affairs, as Trotsky was too important to be intimately involved with his wife. When she returns to Mexico, he asks for a divorce. In 1940, Trotsky is murdered in Mexico City. Initially, Rivera is suspected by police of orchestrating the assassination. When they fail to locate him, Kahlo is arrested. Cristina arrives and escorts Kahlo out of prison, explaining that Rivera convinced President Cárdenas to release her.

Kahlo has her toes removed when her doctor notices they have become gangrenous. Rivera remorsefully asks Kahlo to remarry him, and she agrees. Her health worsens, leading to the amputation of a leg and bronchopneumonia, which leaves her bedridden. In 1953, Kahlo&#x27;s bed is carried from her home to a museum to attend her first solo exhibition in her native country.

==Allusions and paintings==
The passengers in the bus Kahlo rides in that crashes with a streetcar are based on subjects in the painter&#x27;s 1929 portrait, &quot;The Bus&quot;. Other Kahlo paintings either shown directly or depicted in the film by the characters include &quot;Frieda and Diego Rivera&quot; (1931), &quot;What the Water Gave Me&quot; (1938), &quot;The Two Fridas&quot; (1939), &quot;The Broken Column&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Wounded Deer&quot; (1946).

The film&#x27;s stop motion animation sequence (created by The Brothers Quay) depicting the initial stages of Kahlo&#x27;s recovery at the hospital after the accident is inspired by the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead. The gown Valeria Golino wears at Kahlo&#x27;s 1953 Mexican solo art exhibition is a replica of the dress that her character, Lupe Marín, wore in Rivera&#x27;s 1938 portrait of her.

The film version of Frida Kahlo&#x27;s life was initially championed by Nancy Hardin, a former book editor and Hollywood-based literary agent, turned early &quot;female studio executive&quot;, who, in the mid-1980s wished to &quot;make the transition to independent producing.&quot; Learning of Hayden Herrera&#x27;s biography of Kahlo, Hardin saw Kahlo&#x27;s life as very contemporary, her &quot;story ... an emblematic tale for women torn between marriage and career.&quot; Optioning the book in 1988, Hardin &quot;tried to sell it as an epic love story in the tradition of &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, attracting tentative interest from actresses such as Meryl Streep and Jessica Lange, but receiving rejection from the film studios.

Kahlo&#x27;s art gained prominence, and &quot;in May 1990 one of Kahlo&#x27;s self-portraits sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $1.5 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a Latin American painting.&quot; Madonna &quot;announced her plans to star in a film based on Frida&#x27;s life&quot;, and Robert De Niro&#x27;s Tribeca Productions reportedly &quot;envisioned a joint biography of Rivera and Kahlo.&quot; In the spring of 1991, director Luis Valdez began production on a New Line feature about Frida Kahlo starring Laura San Giacomo in the lead. San Giacomo&#x27;s casting received objections due to her non-Hispanic ethnicity, and New Line complied with the protesters&#x27; demands, and left the then-titled &quot;Frida and Diego&quot; in August 1992 citing finances. Hardin&#x27;s project found itself swamped by similar ones:

When I first tried to sell the project ... there was no interest because nobody had heard of Frida. A few years later, I heard the exact oppositethat there were too many Frida projects in development, and nobody wanted mine.

Valdez was contacted early on by Salma Hayek, then unknown in the U.S., who sent &quot;her [promo] reel to the director and phoned his office&quot;, but was ultimately told she was then too young for the role. By 1993, Valdez had retitled the film &quot;The Two Fridas&quot; with San Giacomo and Ofelia Medina both playing the portraitist. Raúl Juliá was cast as Diego Rivera, but his death further delayed the movie. At the same time, Hardin approached HBO, and with &quot;rising young development executive and producer&quot; Lizz Speed (a former assistant to Sherry Lansing) intended to make a television movie, hopeful that Brian Gibson (director of &quot;&quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do With It&quot;, the story of Tina Turner&quot; and &quot;The Josephine Baker Story&quot;) would direct. Casting difficulties proved insurmountable, but Speed joined Hardin in advocating for the project, and after four years in development, the two took the project from HBO to Trimark and producer Jay Polstein (with assistant Darlene Caamaño). At Trimark, Salma Hayek became interested in the role, having &quot;been fascinated by Kahlo&#x27;s work from the time she was 13 or 14&quot;although not immediately a fan:

Hayek was so determined to play the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and, after his death, administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera&#x27;s art, which Rivera had &quot;willed ... to the Mexican people&quot;, bequeathing the trust to Olmedo. Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo&#x27;s paintings from her, and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. According to Molina, &quot;She turned up backstage [of the Broadway play &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot;] rather sheepishly, and asked if I would like to play Diego&quot;. Molina went on to gain 35 pounds to play Rivera. When producer Polstein left Trimark, however, the production faltered again, and Hayek approached Harvey Weinstein and Miramax, and the company purchased the film from Trimark; Julie Taymor came onto the project as director. Meanwhile, in August 2000 it was announced that Jennifer Lopez would star in Valdez&#x27;s take on the story, &quot;The Two Fridas&quot;, by then being produced by American Zoetrope. Nonetheless, it was Hayek and Miramax who began production in Spring, 2001 on what was to become simply titled &quot;Frida&quot;. Edward Norton rewrote the script at least once but was not credited as a writer.

===Sexual misconduct by producer Harvey Weinstein===
In a December 2017 op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hayek stated that Weinstein attempted to thwart the making of the film because Hayek had refused to grant him sexual favors and that he had threatened to shut down the film unless Hayek agreed to include a full-frontal nude sex scene with herself and another woman. In response, Weinstein claimed that none of the sexual allegations made by Hayek was accurate and that he did not recall pressuring Hayek &quot;to do a gratuitous sex scene.&quot;

==Release==
On August 29, 2002, &quot;Frida&quot; made its world premiere opening at the Venice International Film Festival. &quot;Frida&quot;&#x27;s American premiere was at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles on October 14 of that year. It had its Mexican premiere on November 8, 2002, at Mexico City&#x27;s Palace of Fine Arts.

===Box office===
&quot;Frida&quot; grossed $25.9 million in the United States and Canada and $30.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $56.3 million, against a production budget of $12 million. It was initially shown in five theaters and earned $205,996 upon its opening weekend in the United States. The following week the film expanded to forty-seven theaters, earning $1,323,935. By late December 2002, &quot;Frida&quot; was playing in 283 theaters and had earned over $20 million.

===Critical reception===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% of 158 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.88/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Frida&quot; is a passionate, visually striking biopic about the larger-than-life artist.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a score of 1–100 to individual film reviews, gives the film an average rating of 61 based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Stella Papamichael from the &quot;BBC&quot; gave the film three out of five stars and stated &quot;Julie Taymor&#x27;s biography of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo connects the dots between art and anguish. The disparity lies in the fact that Frida settles for tickling a fancy where it should be packing a punch. Although involving and sprightly, it offers the kind of guilty pleasure a Fine Arts student might derive from a glossy cartoon strip.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded &quot;Frida&quot; three and a half stars and commented: &quot;Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite, but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did, too.&quot; Ebert thought Taymor and the writers had &quot;obviously struggled with the material&quot;, though he called the closing scenes &quot;extraordinary.&quot;

The &quot;New York Post&#x27;s&quot; Jonathan Foreman praised the score and Taymor&#x27;s direction, saying that she &quot;captures both the glamorous, deeply cosmopolitan milieu Kahlo and Rivera inhabited, and the importance Mexico had in the &#x27;30s for the international left.&quot; He added that the odd accents adopted by the likes of Judd and Rush let the authenticity down.

Andrew Pulver from &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film three stars and proclaimed that it is &quot;a substantial film, its story told with economy and clarity.&quot;

==Accolades==

The American Film Institute included &quot;Frida&quot; in their Movies of the Year 2002, Official Selection. Their rationale was:

&quot;Frida&quot; is a movie about art that is a work of art in itself. The film&#x27;s unique visual language takes us into an artist&#x27;s head and reminds us that art is best enjoyed when it moves, breathes and is painted on a giant canvas, as only the movies can provide.

<text>Sanjeev Kumar (born Harihar Jethalal Jariwala; 9 July 1938 – 6 November 1985) was an Indian actor. He is well remembered for his versatility and genuine portrayal of his characters. He acted in genres ranging from romantic dramas to thrillers, and was voted the seventh greatest actor of Indian cinema of all time in a poll conducted by Rediff.com. His double role in the film &quot;Angoor&quot; was listed among the 25 best acting performances of Indian cinema by Forbes India on the occasion of celebrating 100 years of Indian Cinema. 

He won several major awards, including two National Film Awards for Best Actor for his performances in the movies &quot;Dastak&quot; (1970) and &quot;Koshish&quot; (1972). Unlike his peers, Kumar did not mind playing roles that were non-glamorous, such as characters well beyond his age. Movies such as iconic character &quot;Thakur&quot; in &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975) &quot;Arjun Pandit&quot; (1976) and &quot;Trishul&quot; (1978), along with the remakes of Tamil films into Hindi such as &quot;Khilona&quot; (1970), &quot;Naya Din Nai Raat&quot; (1974), &quot;Yehi Hai Zindagi&quot; (1977), &quot;Devata&quot; (1978) and &quot;Ram Tere Kitne Naam&quot; (1985) exemplify his versatility. He also did suspense-thriller films such as &quot;Shikar&quot; (1968), &quot;Uljhan&quot; (1975) and &quot;Trishna&quot; (1978) and &quot;Qatl&quot; (1986), Kumar also proved himself to do comedy in films such as &quot;Manchali&quot; (1973), &quot;Pati Patni Aur Woh&quot; (1978), &quot;Biwi-O-Biwi&quot; (1981) &quot;Angoor&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hero&quot; (1983).

== Early life and background ==
Sanjeev Kumar was born as Harihar Jethalal Jariwala (also referred to as Haribhai) on 9 July 1938 in Surat into a Gujarati family. He came to Mumbai when he was very young. A stint in a film school led him to Bollywood, where he eventually became an accomplished actor. He is widely acclaimed by the critics and general public alike to be one of the all-time greatest actors that Indian Cinema has ever produced.

Kumar had two younger brothers and one sister. He spoke Gujarati, Hindi and English fluently.

Kumar started his acting career as a stage actor, starting with IPTA in Bombay and later joining the Indian National Theatre. Even as a stage actor, he had a penchant for playing older roles; at age 22, he played an old man in an adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot;. In the following year, in the play &quot;Damru&quot; directed by A.K. Hangal, he again played the role of a 60-year-old with six children.

He made his film debut with a small role in &quot;Hum Hindustani&quot; in 1960. His first film as a protagonist was in Nishan (1965). In 1968, he acted alongside the famous actor of that time, Dilip Kumar, in Sangharsh. He also starred opposite Shammi Kapoor and Sadhana in the superhit film Sachaai (1969).

He starred in the 1966 Gujarati film &quot;Kalapi&quot;, which was based on the poet Kalapi&#x27;s life, with him playing the title role, Padmarani playing the role of his wife, Rama, and Aruna Irani as the love interest. The film was directed by Manhar Raskapur. Later Aruna Irani was paired opposite Sanjeev in another Gujarati film, &quot;Mare Javun Pele Par&quot; (1968).

In 1970, the movie &quot;Khilona&quot;, which was the remake of Gujarati film &quot;Mare Javun Pele Paar&quot; (1968), brought Kumar national recognition. In 1972, he played in an Indo-Iranian film, &quot;Subah-O-Shaam&quot;. This was when the director Gulzar first spotted him. Later he cast Kumar in the roles of older men in 4 films &quot;Parichay&quot; (1972), &quot;Koshish&quot; (1973), &quot;Aandhi&quot; (1975) and &quot;Mausam&quot; (1975). Gulzar cast Kumar in role of young man in the films &quot;Angoor&quot; (1981) and &quot;Namkeen&quot; (1982). Kumar won the BFJA Awards for Best Actor (Hindi) for his exemplary portrayal of a deaf and mute person in &quot;Koshish&quot;, in which the female lead was played by Jaya Bhaduri, who acted as his deaf and mute wife and was herself nominated for Best Actor award by Filmfare for the same role. He went on to star in the box office hits &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot; (1972), &quot;Manchali&quot; (1973) and &quot;Aap Ki Kasam&quot; (1974). In 1973, he made a guest appearance during a song in a Tamil movie, &quot;Bharatha Vilas&quot; (1973). He performed in nine movies directed by Gulzar. Hrishikesh Mukherjee directed him in &quot;Arjun Pandit&quot;, for which he won the Filmfare Best Actor Award.

He did three films opposite famous Tamil actress L. Vijayalakshmi, including &quot;Husn Aur Ishq&quot; and &quot;Badal&quot; which became hits. Their first film was &quot;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&quot; which was unsuccessful. His &quot;Raja Aur Runk&quot;, released in 1968, was a great success. He did &quot;Kangan&quot;, &quot;Rivaaj&quot;, &quot;Zindagi&quot;, &quot;Be-Reham&quot;, &quot;Archana&quot; and &quot;Do Ladkiyan&quot; opposite Mala Sinha. He did &quot;Priya&quot;, &quot;Anubhav&quot;, &quot;Gustaaki Maaf&quot;, &quot;Bachpan&quot; and &quot;Khud-Daar&quot; with Tanuja. He was paired with Raakhee in &quot;Angaare&quot;, &quot;Paras&quot;, &quot;Trishna&quot;, &quot;Shriman Shrimati&quot; and &quot;Hamare Tumhare&quot;. His hits with Leena Chandavarkar included &quot;Apne Rang Hazar&quot;, &quot;Manchali&quot; and &quot;Anhonee&quot;. He was paired regularly with Sulakshana Pandit in films such as &quot;Uljhan&quot; and &quot;Waqt Ki Deewar&quot; and with Moushumi Chatterjee in &quot;Itni Si Baat&quot; and &quot;Daasi&quot;.

The producers and directors of the South wanted to remake their Tamil and Telugu films in Hindi with either Kumar or Rajesh Khanna in lead. It was these Hindi film remakes that elevated him to a great actor. &quot;Khilona&quot; and its Tamil version &quot;Engirundho Vandhaal&quot; were made simultaneously. &quot;Navarathri&quot; was remade as &quot;Naya Din Nai Raat&quot;. Kumar reprised the role played by Thengai Srinivasan in &quot;Yehi Hai Zindagi&quot; which was a remake of &quot;Kaliyuga Kannan&quot;. He starred as the lead &quot;Shaandaar&quot; (1974) which was a remake of &quot;Kasturi Nivasa&quot; with Kannada actor Dr. Rajkumar in the lead. Kumar enacted the role played by AVM Rajan in &quot;Anadhai Aanandhan&quot;, in its Hindi version &quot;Chanda Aur Bijli&quot;. &quot;Gnana Oli&quot; was remade as &quot;Devata&quot; in 1978 with Kumar reprising the role originally played by Sivaji Ganesan. He also acted in &quot;Swarg Narak&quot; (1978) the remake of &quot;Swargam Narakam.&quot; He played the role which N.T. Rama Rao did originally in &quot;Devina Chesina Manushulu&quot;, in its Hindi version Takkar in 1980. &quot;Tayaramma Bangarayya&quot; was remade as &quot;Shriman Shrimati&quot; in 1982, &quot;Raman Ethanai Ramanadi&quot; was remade as &quot;Raam Kitne Tere Naam&quot; in 1985. Kumar reprised the role played by R.Muthuraman in &quot;Alukuoru Aasai&quot; in its Hindi remake &quot;Itni Si Baat&quot; in 1981. Sivaji Ganesan gave Kumar a role in his own home production &quot;Gauri&quot; (1968), which was a remake of &quot;Shanti&quot; (1965). The role played by S.S. Rajendran in &quot;Shanti&quot; was re-enacted by Kumar in &quot;Gauri&quot;.

Northern Indian producers and directors cast Sanjeev Kumar primarily in supporting roles in films like Khud-Daar, Sawaal, Zabardast, Hero, and Silsila. Sanjeev Kumar&#x27;s excellent comic timing entertained audiences in films such as &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;, &quot;Biwi O Biwi&quot; (1981), &quot;Pati, Patni Aur Woh&quot;, &quot;Angoor&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hero&quot; (1983).

His performances in films such as , &quot;Grihapravesh&quot;, &quot;Chehre Pe Chehra&quot;, Suraag, &quot;Sawaal&quot; and &quot;Yaadgaar&quot; were appreciated by critics. Kumar always demonstrated a willingness to take on unconventional roles that challenged him as an actor. His role as Mirza Sajjad Ali, a chess-obsessed Lucknowi (citizen of Lucknow), in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s classic &quot;Shatranj Ke Khilari&quot; (1977) exemplified that aspect. Perhaps his best-remembered roles were in the blockbuster films &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975) and &quot;Trishul&quot; (1978). His portrayal of the character Thakur, from &quot;Sholay&quot; was one of his stellar performances. In &quot;Naya Din Nayi Raat&quot; (1974), Sanjeev Kumar reprised nine-roles. This film enhanced his status and reputation as a serious player in Bollywood. He stood his ground against leading superstars such as Rajesh Khanna in &quot;Aap Ki Kasam&quot;; Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor in the Yash Chopra multi-star cast film &quot;Trishul&quot; (1978) and Dilip Kumar in &quot;Sangharsh&quot; and &quot;Vidhaata&quot; (1982).

He has done many regional films in different languages including Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Sindhi and his mother tongue Gujarati. In 1980, he starred in the Punjabi movie &quot;Fauji Chacha&quot;. He has made guest appearances in two Tamil films, &quot;Bharata Vilas&quot; and &quot;Uyarndhavargal&quot; (a remake of &quot;Koshish&quot;).

== Personal life ==
Kumar remained single all his life. He had proposed to Hema Malini in 1973 and they remained in touch thereafter. Sulakshana Pandit later recounted having been in love with him and having proposed marriage to him which he politely declined. It is speculated as a result of this rejection, Pandit chose to remain unmarried.

== Health problems and death ==
After his first heart attack, he underwent a bypass surgery in the U.S. However, on 6 November 1985, at the age of 47, he suffered a massive heart attack, which resulted in his death. His younger brother Nikul died before him, while his other brother Kishore died six months later.

More than ten movies starring Sanjeev Kumar were released after his death, with the last one, &quot;Professor Ki Padosan&quot;, released in 1993. At the time of his death, only about three-fourths of this movie was complete, and it was eventually decided to alter the story line in the second half to explain the absence of Kumar&#x27;s character.

<doc id="509802" wikidata="Q5632118" url="?curid=509802" title="HMS Detroit (1813)">
<text>HMS &quot;Detroit was a 20-gun [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in July 1813 and serving on [[Lake Erie]] during the [[War of 1812]]. She was the most powerful British ship in the Lake Erie [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] until the Americans captured her during the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] on 10 September 1813. &quot;Detroit&quot; was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[United States Navy]] as its firstUSS &quot;Detroit. However, she was so damaged that the sloop took no further part in the war. Postwar, &quot;Detroit&quot; was sunk for preservation at Misery Bay off Presque Isle until 1833, when she was refloated and converted for commercial service. In 1841, &quot;Detroit&quot; was reduced to a hulk at Buffalo, New York, where she was purchased with the intent of sending her over Niagara Falls. The plan went awry and &quot;Detroit&quot; ran aground on a shoal before the falls and broke up.

==Design and description==
In November 1812, the British learned of the American plan to gain mastery over the upper Great Lakes. In response, the British ordered the construction of a new vessel at Amherstburg Royal Naval Dockyard in Amherstburg, Upper Canada. The design of the vessel was a repeat of , which itself was based on the ocean-going sloops. The design was modified by Master Shipwright William Bell for service on the Great Lakes.

The ship measured 305 tons burthen (bm) and was long between perpendiculars with a beam of , a depth of hold of and a draught of . After capture by the Americans in 1813, the dimensions of &quot;Detroit&quot; were reported as long with a beam of and a draught of 12 ft, but this has been discredited as an attempt by Jesse Elliott to claim larger ships to receive larger payouts from the prize courts as it produced disproportionate measurements. The Americans give the displacement of the vessel as .

No design drawings remain, though from contemporary art, &quot;Detroit&quot; was seen to have a flush, corvette-style upper deck, pierced for 20 guns. The ship was designed to be armed with four long guns and sixteen carronades. However, due to the inability of the British to resupply Amherstburg during the War of 1812, the sloop of was armed with a mix of guns taken from other ships in the Lake Erie squadron and from Fort Malden. The hodgepodge armament was composed of one 24-pounder carronade, one carronade, two 24-pounder long guns, one 18-pounder long gun on a pivot, six long guns and eight long guns. At the Battle of Lake Erie, the ship had a company of 150.

==Construction and career==
Construction of &quot;Detroit&quot; began in January 1813, however delays began almost immediately as William Bell complained that he did not have enough shipwrights. The construction placed further burdens on British supply lines, with the vessel requiring of oak timber, 200 oak knees and over of pine timber and boards. Furthermore, there was shortages of fabric for sails, bolts, sheaves and deadeyes. Reinforced by shipwrights sent from Kingston, Upper Canada, planking of the sloop began in April. However, this was soon interrupted when Brigadier General Henry Procter ordered the shipwrights to concentrate their efforts on the construction of gunboats for the army.

On 27 April 1813, the guns meant for &quot;Detroit&quot; were captured at the battle of York. Commander Robert Barclay of the Royal Navy arrived in June to take command of the Lake Erie squadron. In June and July, Barclay and the Lake Erie squadron made several voyages to Long Point to await reinforcements and stores meant for &quot;Detroit&quot;. Barclay&#x27;s American counterpart, Oliver Hazard Perry was also constructing newer, more powerful ships at Put-in-Bay and these were completed before &quot;Detroit&quot; became operational. Barclay was forced to retreat to Amherstburg to await &quot;Detroit&quot;″s completion. In the meantime, the Perry blockaded Long Point, preventing further supplies from reaching Amherstburg.

As the situation at Amherstburg became untenable, Procter and Barclay agreed that Barclay would have to challenge Perry&#x27;s American squadron. &quot;Detroit&quot; launched in mid-July and was commissioned into the Royal Navy in August as Barclay&#x27;s flagship. Without the guns that were captured at York, Barclay was forced to arm &quot;Detroit&quot; with a mix of guns pulled from other vessels in the squadron and Fort Malden. The guns themselves were not in optimal condition, as they lacked flintlocks and required alternative and less dependable means for firing them. For sails, a spare set from &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; was used. Furthermore, there was a lack of sailors in the squadron, with crews being filled out with soldiers from Procter&#x27;s army.

===Battle of Lake Erie===
Barclay and his squadron set sail from Amherstburg on 9 September 1813 intending to bring the American squadron to battle. The two forces met on 10 September, and &quot;Detroit&quot; which was second in Barclay&#x27;s line of battle, squared up with Perry&#x27;s flagship . &quot;Detroit&quot; began that battle with a single shot from its 24-pounder long gun directed at &quot;Lawrence&quot;. It missed, but &quot;Detroit&quot;″s second shot hit. &quot;Lawrence&quot; and the schooners and engaged &quot;Detroit&quot;, with &quot;Lawrence&quot; exchanging broadsides with &quot;Detroit&quot;. &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; moved up the battle line and added her guns to &quot;Detroit&quot;″s in battering &quot;Lawrence&quot;, eventually knocking the American ship out of the battle. This forced Perry to shift his command to .

By this point Barclay had been injured and command of &quot;Detroit&quot; had passed to Lieutenant George Inglis. After Perry had shifted to &quot;Niagara&quot;, he moved the vessel up the American battle line, and closer to &quot;Detroit&quot; in order to engage the British flagship. &quot;Detroit&quot; began firing at &quot;Niagara&quot;, but by this point was heavily damaged and the crew tired, unlike &quot;Niagara&quot; which had to this point, barely taken part in the battle. &quot;Niagara&quot; moved to pass in front of &quot;Detroit&quot;″s bow in order to rake the British ship. &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, to this point unable to engage &quot;Niagara&quot;, attempted to get into a position to attack the American vessel. However, in doing so, became entangled in &quot;Detroit&quot;″s yardarms, locking the two vessels together and immobilising them. &quot;Niagara&quot; continued to fire on the two British ships while they tried to disentangle themselves, causing considerable damage. After untangling, &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; struck her colours, followed by &quot;Detroit&quot; and the rest of the British squadron.

===American service===
The British prizes were taken to Put-in-Bay and laid up to prevent the ship from sinking. The Americans used their prizes &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; as hospital ships. A gale swept the lake on 13 September and dismasted both, further damaging the already battered ships. Once the wounded had been ferried to Erie, Pennsylvania, the two British ships were effectively reduced to hulks. In May 1814 assisted in fitting out prizes &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; at Put-in Bay, and convoyed them to Erie in November. There the vessels were used as receiving ships for the rest of the war.

Following ratification of the Treaty of Ghent in 1815, the Americans submerged &quot;Detroit&quot; at Misery Bay off Presque Isle Bay in order to preserve the ship. In 1816 the Rush-Bagot Treaty, which demilitarized the Great Lakes, came into effect; the treaty limited each nation to two warships on the upper Great Lakes. On 8 August 1825 the US government closed the Lake Erie station and sold the submerged &quot;Detroit&quot; and other vessels to the merchant Benjamin H. Brown of Rochester, New York. He did nothing with them until 20 June 1836 when he sold them to George Miles of Erie. Miles raised &quot;Detroit&quot; and fitted the vessel out as a trading barque. She worked on the Great Lakes until 1841, when she was laid up at Buffalo, New York, as a hulk.

===Fate===
A group of merchants purchased the hulk in September 1841, intending to create a spectacle at Niagara Falls. They had her re-rigged to sail and set her loose atop Niagara Falls hoping that she would go over the falls to smash at their base. However, &quot;Detroit&quot; ran aground on a shoal before reaching the falls. &quot;Detroit&quot; eventually broke up on site.

<text>The 2004 presidential campaign of George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, announced his candidacy for re-election as president on May 16, 2003. On September 2, 2004, he again became the nominee of the Republican Party for the 2004 presidential election. Along with his running mate, Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush was opposed in the general election by U.S. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, minor candidates from other parties. The election took place on Tuesday, November 2, 2004.

George W. Bush&#x27;s chief political strategist was Karl Rove, who had the title Senior Advisor to the President. Mark McKinnon was the chief communications strategist. He was later joined in August 2004 by Karen Hughes, a former Bush advisor who returned after some time away. His campaign manager was Ken Mehlman.

This re-election campaign was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government.

== 2004 primary campaign==

President Bush formally filed with the FEC on May 16, 2003. As he was virtually unopposed, he did no campaigning during the primary season.

On March 10, 2004, Bush clinched the number of delegates require for the nomination, 1608 Delegates 168 Super delegates.

==Vice Presidential choices==

In May 2003, Vice President Dick Cheney told reporters that &quot;The president has asked me if I would serve again as his running mate. I&#x27;ve agreed to do that.&quot; In early 2004, with Bush expected to face a difficult re-election campaign, political commentators openly discussed the possibility that Cheney might be dropped from the ticket due to his &quot;personal baggage&quot;. Such concern derived particularly from allegations that Cheney had lied about the rationale for the Iraq War, and that his former company Halliburton had profited inappropriately from that war. Some analysts even floated the idea that Cheney – who had previously suffered four heart attacks – might step down on his own for health reasons.

Among those viewed as strong contenders for his replacement were: Bill Frist, the Senate Majority Leader; Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City; George Pataki, the Governor of New York; Rob Portman, congressman of Ohio; Bill Owens, the Governor of Colorado; and Tom Ridge, the Secretary of Homeland Security. In July, former Senator Al D&#x27;Amato, Republican of New York, publicly stated that Bush should replace Cheney, and suggested Secretary of State Colin Powell or Arizona Senator John McCain as potential choices. Going into the Republican National Convention at the end of August, many delegates still entertained the notion of a new vice president, with Powell and Giuliani leading in a preference poll. Despite the speculation, Bush publicly maintained his support for Cheney, who accepted the party&#x27;s formal nomination on September 1.

==Convention and nomination==

Bush gave many promises during his acceptance speech to the 2004 Republican National Convention. At the end of his speech, he encouraged listeners to view his website in order to learn more about his agenda if he wins his next presidential term. His speech promises include the following which his campaign is called &quot;A Plan for A Safer World &amp; More Hopeful America&quot;:

*Rewrite and simplification of Tax Code
*Creation of &quot;Opportunity zones&quot; to encourage companies to move into areas where companies closed
*Allowing and encouraging small businesses to join to negotiate for health care
*Establishment of health centers in every poor or rural county in the country that does not have one
*Promoting flexible schedules to make companies family friendly
*More funding for local and community colleges
*Creating personal social security account options to allow social security to be self managed for younger workers

As a result of Bush&#x27;s speech in NYC, the incumbent president was able to get a significant bounce in the polls. The day after the convention was finished, the polls showed Bush with a double-digit lead over John Kerry, although when the poll asked about the economy both candidates were still in a dead heat.

==Issue stances==

===Abortion===
Bush expressed opinions in agreement with the pro-life movement.

===Community aid===
Bush established the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives, which allowed the federal government to fund community aid programs that were provided by a religious institution. He proposed a youth mentoring program for disadvantaged students and children of prisoners.

===Economy===
Bush supported making the tax cuts passed during his first term permanent; he maintained that the tax cuts made the recent recession shallower and shorter than it would otherwise have been.

He supported job creation, by tax loopholes to invest in more higher job creation to &quot;state and local control&quot; than the federal government.

===Health care===
Bush&#x27;s proposals for expanding health care coverage were more modest than those advanced by Senator Kerry. Several estimates were made comparing the cost and impact of the Bush and Kerry proposals. While the estimates varied, they all indicated that the increase in coverage and the funding requirements of the Bush plan would both be lower than those of the more comprehensive Kerry plan.

===Education===
Bush signed the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot;, which requires mandatory standardized testing, forces schools that do not meet standards to provide alternate options for students, and stated the aim of closing the race and gender gap in schools. His FY 2005 budget proposed a 1% increase in elementary and secondary education compared to the FY 2001 budget.

===Environment===
Bush&#x27;s Clear Skies Act repealed or reduced air pollution controls, including environmental protections of the Clean Air Act. His FY 2005 budget provided $4.4 billion for conservation programs. He signed legislation pushing for the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites (also known as brownfields) and keeping forest fires at bay. He fell under criticism for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol which would commit the United States to reducing greenhouse gas emissions which are believed by much of the relevant science community to cause global warming. The Bush administration stated that this would cost the economy up to US$14 billion.

===Homeland security===
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act and created the Department of Homeland Security. He also created the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). He then promoted the idea of an independent &quot;Czar of Intelligence&quot; outside of the White House in response to the 9/11 Commission&#x27;s findings.

===Same-sex marriage and gay rights===
Bush has expressed support for &quot;protecting the sanctity of marriage.&quot; He endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment that would define marriage for all of the states as strictly heterosexual. Late in the 2004 campaign, however, he said that the states should be allowed to &quot;enable people to you know, be able to have rights, like others&quot;, though marriage would not be among them. Activists on both sides of the issue took this comment as endorsing civil unions.

===National security and foreign policy===
President Bush submitted his National Security Strategy of the United States; the &quot;three pillars&quot; of this are to:
* Defend the peace by working against terrorists and terrorist-tolerating regimes.
* Preserve the peace by maintaining relations with allies and reaching out to nations to combat terrorism.
* Extend the peace by spreading democracy and human rights across the globe.

====Afghanistan====
Supported continued American involvement in Afghanistan. Believed President Hamid Karzai to be beneficial to Afghanistan&#x27;s progress.

====Libya====
In a series of negotiations which involved Libya, Britain, and the United States, Libya turned over materials relevant to the production of nuclear weapons.

====Iraq====
Supported the continuation of American military presence in Iraq. Promoted the goal of democratic elections by January 2005 as integral to the nation&#x27;s democratic reform. Bush ran as the war president.

====Saudi Arabia====
Bush advocated pressure on the Saudi Royal Family to more directly combat terrorism and to seize the assets of terrorists operating within their borders.

==Campaign controversies==

===Military service controversy===
In previous campaigns, Bush had been criticized for his military service record. He skipped over a long waiting list to receive a spot in the Air National Guard; once he was in the Guard, it has been alleged he did not complete all his required duties. These long-standing charges were given more attention in the 2004 campaign because of the contrast with Kerry&#x27;s record as a decorated combat veteran of the Vietnam War.

A group of Bush supporters countered with an advertising campaign arguing that some of Kerry&#x27;s medals had been undeserved (see John Kerry military service controversy). The subject was further highlighted when CBS News released memos purportedly from Bush&#x27;s commanding officer in the Guard. The memos added some unflattering details about Bush&#x27;s Guard service. Almost immediately, however, widespread doubts were raised about their . CBS News eventually concluded that it could not validate them and that it should not have used them. The incident may have ended up helping Bush by creating doubts about the legitimacy of his detractors.

===Television advertising: 9/11===
Bush&#x27;s campaign launched its first major set of television commercials on March 3, 2004. Although these four spots (three in English and one in Spanish) contained no reference to Senator Kerry, two (one in English and the one in Spanish, both titled, &quot;Safer, Stronger&quot;) generated controversy for their inclusion of four seconds of images drawn from the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, including the wreckage of the World Trade Center site, images of New York firefighters (the New York firefighters&#x27; union supported Kerry), and the image of a flag-draped coffin being carried out of the attack site.

Some families of 9/11 victims accused the Bush campaign of being insensitive to the memory of those who died and of exploiting the tragedy for his personal political gain. Bush campaign advisor Karen Hughes defended the ads as &quot;very tasteful&quot; and noted that 9/11 was a defining event for Bush&#x27;s presidency.

The main topic of this heated discussion is the use of actual images of the attack. The use of images from the attack, said Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, a Democrat, on Face the Nation, implies support from New York firefighters. Rendell claims that a New York firefighters union head supports Kerry for President. But although the International Association of Firefighters was the first union to support Kerry, the Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York endorsed the President for re-election in August 2004.

Defenders of the Bush messages liken his messages to those of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election campaign, which used images of the December 7 attack by Japan on the United States and advised Americans to &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor.&quot;

==Endorsements==
George W. Bush received endorsements from many Republicans, Democratic Senator Zell Miller of Georgia and former 12-year mayor of New York City Ed Koch. The Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York, representing 20,000 active and retired firefighters, endorsed the President on August 31, 2004. On September 22, 2004, the Abe Lincoln Black Republican Caucus, a political organization of gay African American Republicans, voted in a special call meeting in Dallas, Texas, to endorse President George W. Bush for re-election.

==Slogan==
Bush&#x27;s campaign never officially announced a campaign slogan. However, Bush&#x27;s campaign made several bus tours bearing de facto slogans. These include the &quot;Yes, America Can&quot; Bus Tour and the &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; Bus Tour, which used the slogan &quot;Moving America Forward&quot;. The 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City featured the slogan &quot;A Safer World and More Hopeful America&quot;.

==Debates==

On September 20, the Bush campaign and the Kerry campaign jointly released a memorandum of understanding between the two campaigns. The 32-page MOU covered in minute detail many aspects of the staging and format for the presidential and vice-presidential debates.

On September 30, Bush debated Kerry at University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida in the first of three scheduled debates. Polls conducted immediately following the debate suggests that a majority of undecided voters believe that, while neither candidate committed any serious gaffes, Kerry fared better than Bush did.

A second debate, in &quot;town hall&quot; format, was held on October 8 at Washington University in St. Louis with Charles Gibson moderating. Bush later attempted to deflect criticism of what was described as his scowling demeanor during the first debate, joking at one point about one of Kerry&#x27;s remarks, &quot;That answer made me want to scowl.&quot;

The final debate occurred on October 13 at Arizona State University and was moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.

The only vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney and Senator John Edwards happened on October 5 at Case Western Reserve University. It was moderated by Gwen Ifill of the Public Broadcasting Service.

==Features of the campaign==
The foundation of Bush&#x27;s campaign for re-election was ideological conservatism. Members of the campaign team believe there are clear ideological differences between George W. Bush and John Kerry, and believe this contrasts with the 2000 Presidential election, in which both candidates attempted to portray themselves as &quot;centrists&quot;. Critics have argued that the crux of Bush&#x27;s campaign was the suggestion that John Kerry would be soft on terrorism in comparison to George Bush, and to present Bush as a &quot;war President&quot;. They also claim that the Bush campaign is concerned mainly with personalities rather than tackling ideological issues.

Much of the opposition to the Bush campaign (and vis-a-vis support to the Kerry campaign) took the form of &quot;Anybody but Bush&quot; - voters who would vote for anyone else.

==Campaign visits==
Not since the 1972 presidential election had Minnesota been an important Battleground Swing State as it was in 2004. As a result, President George W. Bush made 8 unprecedented campaign visits to Minnesota. On April 26, 2004, he made a first time presidential campaign visit to Edina, Minnesota during which Congressmen Jim Ramstad presented The President with the book &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; by John C. Martin, a U.S. Civil War veteran and Department Commander of the G.A.R. The National Daughters of the Grand Army first presented the book to President Coolidge on August 3, 1928.

==Election and victory==
The election took place on November 2, 2004, and ended with Bush gaining 286 electoral votes and Kerry garnering 251 electoral votes. Ironically, one vote went to Kerry&#x27;s running mate and former presidential candidate, John Edwards, when one of the electors (pledged to Kerry) voted for John Edwards by mistake. This was the first time in U.S. history that an elector had voted the same person for president and vice-president. As President Bush&#x27;s running mate, Vice President Dick Cheney received 286 votes and John Edwards received 252.

The key state that both candidates needed was Ohio. Ohio had 20 electoral votes, which were essential for either candidate to surpass the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the overall election and determined which candidate won the election. Ohio was reporting its results, but had not counted provisional ballots. In Ohio, Kerry trailed by 136,000 votes (not including provisional ballots). The chances of Kerry gaining the necessary votes through provisional ballots was slim.

Around 2:00 p.m. EST on November 3, 2004, John Kerry made a speech at Faneuil Hall, Boston. In this speech, he announced that he &quot;cannot win this election.&quot; One hour later, George W. Bush declared that &quot;America has spoken&quot; and they had made a &quot;historic victory.&quot; He said to Kerry supporters, &quot;To make this nation stronger and better, I will need your support, and I will work to earn it.&quot;

With 286 electoral votes, President George W. Bush won the 2004 Presidential Election. Bush received over 62 million popular votes and Kerry received over 59 million votes.

<text>Pinus amamiana (Amami pine, Yakushima white pine) is a species of pine. It is a native of southern Japan, on the islands of Yakushima and Tanegashima south of Kyūshū. It has also been grown horticulturally in Japanese parks. This pine can grow to a height of 25 m with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m.

The needles grow in bundles of five and the cones are 5–8 cm in length.

This tree is known in Japanese as &quot;amami-goyōmatsu&quot;, &quot;amami-goyō&quot;, and &quot;yakutane-goyō&quot;.

<doc id="509810" wikidata="Q7372954" url="?curid=509810" title="Roy Hofheinz">
<text>Roy Mark Hofheinz (April 10, 1912 – November 22, 1982), popularly known as Judge Hofheinz or &quot;The Judge&quot;, was a Texas state representative from 1935 to 1937 (44th legislature), county judge of Harris County, Texas from 1936 to 1944, and mayor of the city of Houston from 1953 to 1956.

==Early and personal life==
Hofheinz was born on April 10, 1912, in Beaumont, Texas. The Hofheinz family moved to Houston in 1924. He graduated from San Jacinto High School with highest honors as a champion debater and started work in 1928 at age 16 after his father died. In the summer of 1928, Hofheinz was an aide at the Democratic National Convention held in Houston; he befriended future U.S. senator and president Lyndon B. Johnson at the convention. Hofheinz matriculated at Rice University and Houston Junior College before graduating from the now-defunct Houston Law School in 1931 at age 19.

He married Irene (&quot;Dene&quot;, née Cafcalas; 1912–1966) in 1933, a fellow law student; together they had three children: Roy Jr. (1935–), Fred (1938–), and Dene (1942–). The two had met at the University of Houston in 1929. After the death of his first wife, Hofheinz married his divorced executive assistant, Mary Frances (née Gougenheim) on April 10, 1969. Hofheinz survived a stroke in 1970 that left him in a wheelchair; he eventually died in 1982 from an apparent heart attack.

Judge Hofheinz was known for his cigar habit; in a 1969 profile for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; he gently chided the author, Tex Maule: &quot;Don&#x27;t say &#x27;smoke.&#x27; &#x27;Consume&#x27; is the word. I chew a lot of them and give some away.&quot; He preferred the Sans Souci Perfecto cigar, approximately long, consuming 25 per day.

===Residences===
When he was serving as the mayor of Houston, he lived in a home on Galveston Bay which he named &quot;Huckster House&quot; (also known as the Gribble-Hofheinz House, Texas Historical Marker no. 10683); he had acquired it in 1950 and decorated the interior with a circus theme. In 1956, he purchased the Cochran-Hofheinz House; the house had originally been built for banker Owen L. Cochran around 1912.

Hofheinz had two separate residences in the Astrodomain: the Judge&#x27;s Quarters, a 24-room suite on the sixth floor of the Astrodome decorated in an eclectic fashion that Bob Hope quipped was &quot;early King Farouk&quot;, where he moved after the death of his first wife; and the Celestial Suites on the ninth floor of the Astroworld Hotel, with interiors designed by Harper Goff, which Elvis Presley reportedly found too gaudy. Hofheinz decamped from the Judge&#x27;s Quarters in the Astrodome in 1972; the suite was removed in 1988. The Celestial Suites are still present on the top floor of the Astroworld Hotel (now a Crowne Plaza), but have not been used recently.

Hofheinz purchased an historic River Oaks mansion (also known as the T.J. and Ruth Bettes House, originally completed in 1928) in 1980 and lived there until his death in 1982. The city of Houston designated the Bettes House a historic landmark in 2009; The Cochran-Hofheinz House was so designated in 2005.

==Career==
===Politics===
After his father, a laundry truck driver, died when he was 16, Hofheinz became the breadwinner for his family. He opened a private law practice shortly after his graduation in 1931, then served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1935 to 1937 as the youngest person ever elected to the state legislature. After his one term, he ran for and was elected the county judge (the highest-ranking county administrator) for Harris County, Texas from 1936 to 1944, again setting a record for the youngest judge, at age 24. Known in his youth as the &quot;Boy Mayor&quot;, at 23 he was the youngest county administrator in the state. He acted as campaign manager for Lyndon B. Johnson during Johnson&#x27;s rise to the position of Congressman and then two Senatorial campaigns in 1941 and 1948.

He lost an election for a third term as judge in 1944 and returned to private law practice. After World War II, Hofheinz pioneered FM radio and built a network of radio and television stations (including 790 KTHT Houston, now KBME; 1530 KSOX Harlingen TX, now KGBT; 680 KBAT San Antonio, now KKYX) in the Texas Gulf Coast area, and made a business of salvaging the slag from steelmaking, crushing it, and selling it as roadbuilding aggregate.

Major accomplishments of his career as an elected official include leading the city to use oyster shells to pave city streets instead of gravel which had to be brought in from far flung locations at great cost. He also helped reinvent the system which cares for delinquent and homeless youth; creating a model which provided ‘homes’ for the youth rather than treating them as young prisoners. This model was immensely successful and replicated around the country, revolutionizing how municipalities handle troubled youth.

In 1952, Hofheinz was elected to the first of two terms as Mayor of Houston. Hofheinz claimed credit for integrating the Harris County buses and golf courses as a judge, and as mayor, for quietly integrating rest rooms in City Hall and public libraries. He recounted an encounter with a &quot;socially prominent [white] female&quot; as mayor: I won&#x27;t let my children sit by black children in the library; I don&#x27;t know what they would catch! to which he retorted &quot;Maybe tolerance&quot;. His often-contentious relationship with the Houston City Council led to several members of the Council pushing to impeach him in 1955 over a dispute involving higher taxes. Instead of impeachment, as a compromise, Hofheinz was censured and a special election was called for mayor and all seats on the city council. Hofheinz was defeated in the special election. His son Fred served as mayor of Houston in the 1970s.

===Houston sports and entertainment===

The Houston Sports Association (HSA) executive committee was formed in 1957 as a syndicate of local businessmen dedicated to bringing a Major League Baseball franchise to Houston with three founding members: George Kirksey, William Kirkland, and Craig Cullinan. Cullinan, chair of the HSA, previously had been involved with the failed &quot;Continental League&quot;. Local landowner R. E. &quot;Bob&quot; Smith and Hofheinz joined HSA in 1959. Previously, Bob Smith had helped Hofheinz win a second term as mayor in 1954. HSA took advantage of Hofheinz&#x27;s skills as a flamboyant and successful orator, broadcaster, developer, and sportsman. On October 17, 1960, Houston was awarded the Colt .45 franchise in the ten-team National League. HSA purchased the existing minor league team, the Houston Buffaloes, in 1961 and wound down their operations. The Colt .45s played their inaugural game on April 10, 1962, the Judge&#x27;s 50th birthday, beating the Chicago Cubs 11–2 at the temporary outdoor Colt Stadium.

Initially, Hofheinz and Smith each retained a one-third interest in HSA, with the remainder divided between Cullinan (15%), Kirksey (2%), and other investors, including Bud Adams. At the end of the inaugural 1962 season, Cullinan withdrew and sold his shares to Smith, who was already beginning his feud with Hofheinz. Smith and Hofheinz were the principal shareholders in HSA by 1965, and Smith became chairman of the board.
HSA also was responsible for the development of the Astrodome, initially known as the Harris County Domed Stadium, the first large covered baseball and football facility in the world; the earliest discussions of a domed stadium in Houston were held at Hofheinz&#x27;s house. Hofheinz later recounted the genesis for the Astrodome came from a 1962 visit to Rome with his wife Dene: &quot;Mama and I were standing there looking at the Colosseum. It was a large, round facility and most of the stadiums in the United States had been built to conform to the shape of the playing fields. Rectangular. I studied the history of the Colosseum and I found out that on hot days they used to have the slaves pull a cover over the top made out of papyrus or whatever they used in those days. I guess they didn&#x27;t want to spoil the lions&#x27; appetite with too much heat. And I found out, too, that the emperor and the bigwigs all sat at the top of the stadium. Standing there, thinking back on those days, I figured that a round facility with a cover was what we needed in the United States and that Houston would be the perfect spot for it.&quot;

Together, Hofheinz and Smith acquired in the South Loop region of Houston, which was then a swamp, from the owners of the Shamrock Hilton Hotel and resold to Harris County for the site of the Astrodome; to finance its construction, the county issued $31 million in two separate bond votes. HSA leased the Astrodome from the county (at $750,000 per year) and the Colt .45s were renamed the Houston Astros in 1965 when they moved into their new domed stadium. Hofheinz and Smith held 98% of the shares in HSA, with Smith owning the controlling interest of 88%. According to Hofheinz, Smith grew tired of Hofheinz&#x27;s unilateral decisions affecting the construction of the stadium and demanded that he be bought out for $7.5 million on short notice; Hofheinz surprised Smith by raising the money in a week, buying out Smith in August 1965, which put him in control of HSA. As a concession, Hofheinz allowed Smith to retain a 10% interest. Broadcaster Gene Elston described Hofheinz as “a great entrepreneur. But he would take up projects and then drop them and move on to other things. And he didn&#x27;t respect Smith.”

The Astrodome initially used clear plexiglass panes to cover the roof and admit light for the special &quot;Tifway 419&quot; Bermuda grass, but several games were lost when fielders would lose sight of the ball from the glare, and the panels were painted white. Later, after the &quot;Dome&quot; was built, he worked with engineers at Monsanto Corporation to develop Astroturf, an imitation grass now widely used where natural grass does not flourish.
Other landmarks built in the giant southwest Houston development project surrounding the Astrodome, which Hofheinz dubbed the Astrodomain, included the Astrohall exposition center (billed as the largest one-story convention facility in the world) and the first major theme park in coastal Texas, AstroWorld, which opened in 1968. In addition, the Astrodomain included a four-hotel complex totaling 970 rooms on Kirby Drive to serve tourists, Astrodome patrons, and theme park guests.

In 1967, he purchased, along with Israel and Irvin Feld, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Hofheinz became the circus&#x27;s chairman of the board starting on November 11, 1967; his son Fred served as vice president. In 1968, the circus announced it would create a second unit to complement the original unit; the second (Blue) unit would also tour but played two shows per day in the AstroHall for thirteen weeks, starting on May 30, 1969, while the original (Red) unit continued to tour. Hofheinz and the Felds sold the circus to Mattel, Inc. in 1971.

He also owned the Houston Stars professional soccer team, which played in the United Soccer Association in 1967 and North American Soccer League in 1968. The Stars team was actually the Bangu Atlético Clube, imported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

===Erie County Dome Stadium===
In the late 1960s, Hofheinz became partners with Edward Cottrell, a developer from Buffalo, New York, in an effort to have Erie County, New York build what would have been the second domed stadium in the world in Lancaster, just outside Buffalo. The county, Kenford Company, and Dome Stadium, Inc. signed a contract on August 8, 1969. Under the terms of the contract, the overall idea would have been similar to the Astrodome: Kenford would donate land to the county, and the county would construct the domed stadium. Hofheinz formed a corporation, The Dome Stadium, Inc., which would lease the stadium from the county and operate events there for forty years; alternatively, the county could operate the stadium for twenty years, with Kenford and Dome providing management and promotional services.

The contract became the subject of three separate lawsuits brought by interested citizens against the county. The first was filed on August 6, 1969, alleging the contract had been &quot;arbitrary and capricious and fraudulent&quot;; it was dismissed without prejudice on October 1. The second alleged the contract had been awarded without competitive bidding; the request for an injunction to block the contract was denied because an exception existed &quot;for services requiring special skill or training&quot;. The third alleged the contract violated the state constitution &quot;and effected a waste of county funds&quot;; this argument was also dismissed.

In 1970, Erie County narrowly voted to reject the proposed lease, prompting a lawsuit threat from Dome Stadium, Inc. Erie County authorized construction financing of up to $50 million, and the bids for the project totaled more than $70 million, causing the county to pass a resolution in early 1971 declaring an end to its relationship with Kenford/Dome without any legal liability. The slow movement on the Lancaster dome proposal also led Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson to explore team relocation with Seattle city officials. After the county refused to build the facility, Cottrell and Hofheinz began what became a 20-year breach of contract litigation seeking hundreds of millions of dollars of lost profits and damages. After an initial favorable jury verdict, Dome Stadium, Inc.&#x27;s claims ultimately were dismissed following one of the longest jury trials in New York history. Cottrell would eventually receive a $10.2 million settlement in September 1989, but faced a separate lawsuit filed by Hofheinz&#x27;s widow, Mary Frances, who had paid for the lawyers and expert witnesses in their suit against the county. Plans for the stadium were recovered in 2015 and displayed publicly.

===Stroke and Astrodomain sale===
After his stroke on May 14, 1970, Hofheinz consolidated his properties in the Astrodome area under the Astrodomain Corporation. Judge Hofheinz and his family were the sole owners of the Astrodomain Corporation; there were four subsidiary companies: Astroworld USA Inc., Astroworld Hotel Corporation, Astrodome/Astrohall Stadium Corporation, and Houston Sports Association Inc. The Hofheinz family was the sole owner of each subsidiary aside from HSA; 98% of HSA stock was held by the Hofheinz family, and 1% each were held by Earl Allen and the Beck Estate. Hofheinz&#x27;s ill health led to rumors the Astrodomain was for sale in August 1970.

However, the Astrodomain came at hard times just before the recession during the early 1970s. Hofheinz personally controlled 50% of the Astrodomain Corporation, and the other half was held in trust for his three children as an inheritance from their mother, Dene. In the early 1970s, the debt Hofheinz accumulated in purchasing the circus and opening AstroWorld was consolidated in a single $38 million loan held by Ford Motor Credit, General Electric Credit Corporation, and HNC Realty, to be repaid in quarterly installments at an interest rate of 4% above prime. Falling baseball attendance led to cash flow issues, and the three creditors seized control of the Astrodomain, naming a three-person board to run it jointly in June 1975, including Hofheinz, Astrodomain president T.H. Neyland, and Astrodomain first vice president Sidney L. Shlenker. However, Schlenker denied that Hofheinz had lost control of Astrodomain, stating &quot;the judge will retain the title of chairman of the board and will continue to be active as he has been in the past two years&quot;.

By that time, the Six Flags Corporation had entered a long-term lease to operate the AstroWorld theme park. Hofheinz admitted that he had lost control of the Astrodomain in January 1976, in announcing his opposition to a potential move by the Astros to New Orleans. The Astrodomain hotels were sold to Servico in May 1976. Hofheinz sold his remaining shares of the Astrodomain to GE and Ford in September 1976, retaining an option to buy it back within a year. Ford bought out the remaining GE shares in November 1978.

In his time as owner (part or fulltime) from 1962 to 1975, Hofheinz saw the Astros have a winning record just twice.

==Legacy==
Hofheinz was named University of Houston alumnus of the year in 1967.

In 2006, Roy Hofheinz was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame.

Hofheinz Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena on the University of Houston campus which opened in 1969, was named in his honor. In 2016, the Hofheinz family filed suit to require the University of Houston to keep Hofheinz&#x27;s name on the school&#x27;s basketball arena, where the Houston Cougars play. The university has asked the Harris County Probate Court to end the 47-year agreement on Hofheinz Pavilion so that the institution can negotiate a naming-rights deal in a $60 million renovation project set to begin in the spring of 2017. The university and Hofheinz family settled the dispute, and as part of the agreement a plaza with a bronze statue of Hofheinz was built near the new arena.

It was announced on January 20, 2020, by the Astros that Hofheinz would be inducted into the 2020 Houston Astros Hall of Fame for the 2020 class. The ceremony for the class was delayed a year by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in Hofheinz being inducted on August 7, 2021.

On November 1, 2023, it was announced that Hofheinz would be one of the nine inductees for the Texas Sports Hall of Fame class of 2024.

<text>James Fred Hofheinz (born March 15, 1938) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 55th mayor of Houston, Texas, from 1974 to 1978.

Hofheinz&#x27;s father, Roy, was mayor of the city in the 1950s.

==Early life==
Hofheinz graduated from Lamar High School in Houston, where he was a championship debater and also lettered in track and field. He attended the University of Texas, earning a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude in 1960 and continued at Texas to earn both Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in economics. While an undergraduate at Texas, he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. Hofheinz earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Houston in 1964. 

==Career==
Hofheinz was elected in 1973 as mayor by 3,000 votes, with one of his pledges being to fire police chief Herman Short, who had been chief of the city since 1964 and had a reputation as both a supporter of George Wallace and a racist. Short, perceiving Hofheinz as too liberal, resigned that year. Hofheinz replaced Short in January of 1974 with Carroll Lynn. That same year, Hofheinz was named one of &quot;200 Faces for the Future&quot; by&quot;Time&quot;. However, Hofheinz accepted Lynn&#x27;s resignation (replacing him with B. G. Bond) in 1975 after an investigation by Lynn found numerous department irregularities (such as illegal police wiretapping) that led to discord with rank-and-file officers and had opponents waiting to face Hofheinz to use it against him in the upcoming election, which Hofheinz won. Dogged by questions about police management (particularly in regards to perceived brutality in certain cases), Bond resigned in June of 1977, weeks after the body of José Campos Torres was found floating in the Bayou after being beaten to death by officers, of which Bond had fired three involved and had two of them charged with murder (in the fall of that year, the officers on trial received probation). Hofheinz left office in 1978.

After his two terms as mayor, Hofheinz practiced law in Houston. He also served as a board member at Lucas Energy, an independent crude oil and gas company. In 1971, Hofheinz co-founded the closed circuit television company Top Rank. Hofheinz ran again for mayor in 1989 against incumbent mayor Kathy Whitmire (running for her fifth two-year term after having already beaten a former mayor in Louie Welch four years prior). Hofheinz had a lead in the polls at one point but Whitmire on election day won with 60% of the vote.

In 1994, Hofheinz was the sole shareholder of Top Rank when it attempted to purchase the Minnesota Timberwolves and move them to New Orleans, which had the combined efforts of Louisiana politicians and boxing promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank in their attempt to buy the team. The deal fell through when NBA owners voted unanimously to reject the sale, citing concerns about the firmness of Top Rank&#x27;s finances. In 1999, he was indicted in the state of Louisiana as part of the investigation of former governor Edwin Edwards. Hofheinz was one of three businessmen (one a longtime associate of Edwards) indicted on charges of bribery, with Hofheinz delivering bribes to Cecil Brown (a longtime associate of Edwards) meant to advance projects (as overseen by Hofheinz) such as building a juvenile prison and the effort to move the Timberwolves to New Orleans. On November 21, 2000, Hofheinz reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors that saw him plead guilty in failing to report a felony and testify against Collins in exchange for all other charges being dropped; he was issued a fine of $5,000 and sentenced to one year of probation.

Hofheinz currently resides in Houston. Formerly, he had served as an attorney in the law firm of Williams, Birnberg &amp; Andersen L.L.P.

<text>Kathryn Jean Whitmire (née Niederhofer; born August 15, 1946) is an American politician, businesswoman, and accountant best known as the first woman to serve as Mayor of Houston, serving for five consecutive two-year terms from 1982 to 1992. From 1977 to 1981, she was the city controller, a position which made her the first woman elected to any office in the city. Whitmire drew national attention when she defeated former Harris County Sheriff Jack Heard in her election as mayor. The election drew national focus because it symbolized a major political realignment in the fourth-largest city in the United States.

In office, she implemented many reforms to city finances, enabling new programs without raising taxes. Her appointment of the city&#x27;s first African American police chief and the first Hispanic woman as presiding judge of the Municipal Court, her support of a failed job rights bill preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, among other acts, cemented her support among many minority groups.

When former mayor Louie Welch attempted a comeback in the 1985 election, he was unable to mount a convincing argument that he could more ably lead the city out of a recession than Whitmire could. Instead, the opposition to Whitmire focused on public fears about the AIDS epidemic. A so-called &quot;Straight Slate&quot; opposed gay rights and supported Welch, who, however, did not accept its endorsement. The issue failed to affect Whitmire&#x27;s support. She won the election, getting 59.8 percent of the votes. The Straight Slate did force two city council members, Anthony Hall and Judson Robinson, into runoffs which they then won. Whitmire&#x27;s string of victories ended with the 1991 mayoral election when she was defeated by long-time political power broker Bob Lanier and State Representative Sylvester Turner. Lanier defeated Turner in the December runoff. Whitmire has never run for political office again.

==Early life==
Kathy Niederhofer received her basic education in the Houston Independent School District, ultimately graduating from San Jacinto High School. She then enrolled at the University of Houston, and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting in 1968. She continued her studies at the university to earn a Master of Accountancy degree in 1970. In that same year, she married a fellow student, James M. (Jim) Whitmire, who died in 1976. In 1970, she began working in the Houston office of the well-known accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand. She also began working to qualify as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), and opened an accounting firm with her husband. She also served on the faculty of the Department of Business Management at the University of Houston–Downtown.

==Political career==
Kathy Whitmire&#x27;s exposure to and interest in city politics began in her parents&#x27; home. Her father had been active in precinct-level politics, and the family frequently talked about local political issues. Her husband&#x27;s brother, John Whitmire, already a rising star in the Texas Democratic Party, was a willing political mentor.

===Houston City Controller===
After City Treasurer Henry Kriegel was appointed to serve out the unexpired term of Leonel Castillo, who had been appointed as Commissioner of Immigration for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Whitmire was elected to finish Castillo&#x27;s term. She won the race for a full two-year term in a landslide, defeating Steve Jones in the Runoff Elections with 110,762 votes (58.57%) to Jones&#x27; 78,365 votes (41.44%), making history as the first woman ever to hold the office. Upon being inaugurated on January 2, 1978, Whitmire criticized the late then-Mayor Jim McConn for his inefficiency and lax administration. Becoming familiar with &quot;sweetheart contracts&quot;, that had often been awarded to friends and supporters of influential office holders, she stopped the practice by rigorously enforcing observance of the Open Bidding laws. She also diligently looked for inefficiencies or outright wasteful practices in each of the city offices. Although this angered many &quot;insiders&quot;, she won election in 1979 to a second term, becoming the first female elected to a top job in the Houston City government.

===Mayoralty===
Whitmire decided to run for mayor in the 1981 election. The incumbent, Jim McConn, had already served two terms in the office and was supported by the business community, who had largely controlled city politics for decades. However, McConn lost in the general election to Jack Heard, formerly Sheriff of Harris County and the City Controller, Whitmire, sending the race to a runoff between the latter two. There was a sharp contrast between Whitmire and Heard in the runoff election. Heard was 63 years old, with 25 years of experience in political office. Whitmire was only 35 and had little political experience. She said in her speeches that her opponent&#x27;s experience was too narrowly focused on law enforcement. According to one report, Heard spent $1.5 million on the race, while his opponent spent $650,000. While Heard had credibility with those who were more concerned about law and order or maintaining the status quo, Whitmire campaigned on her fiscal conservatism and moderate-to-liberal views on social issues. Whitmire was supported by a coalition of women, minorities, and other groups who were looking for a more progressive city government. These voters had been strengthened by the wave of newcomers who had moved into Houston during the boom years. She won the race with 170,695 votes (62.49%) to Heard&#x27;s 102,446 votes (37.51%) . As noted by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, The developers and bankers and oil millionaires who used to handpick candidates can no longer be said to dominate the political scene. Houston is home today to too many different kinds of people, with too many different sets of values and interests, for any one group to control elections so easily.

Whitmire was the first mayor to appoint an African American, Lee P. Brown, as Houston&#x27;s police chief. Brown had previously served as Commissioner of Public Safety, in Atlanta, Georgia. In Houston, he introduced the concept of Community Policing, creating improved relationships between the police department and the various diverse communities of the city. He left Houston in 1990 to serve as Police Commissioner of New York City. Brown was succeeded by the city&#x27;s first female police chief, Elizabeth Watson, after he resigned to accept the top police job in New York City. Whitmire also appointed the first Hispanic, Sylvia R. Garcia, as presiding judge of the Houston Municipal Court. 

In 1985, she ran for mayor against five-term mayor Louie Welch. She won that election, getting about 60 percent of the vote. She was re-elected in 1987, winning 74 percent of the vote. Her closest rival in a field of six was Bill Anderson, who only received 12 percent of the vote. 

Bob Lanier was a wealthy attorney who was considered a political kingmaker in Houston. During the 1980s, he had sold off much of his investment portfolio, just in time to avoid the economic collapse that engulfed many other investors. Appointed as chairman of the Texas Highway Commission, he became a critic of Mayor Whitmire&#x27;s plan for Houston Metro to build a monorail system. Supporters of the Metro agency decided that it was prudent to compromise with Lanier, so they agreed to fund more street improvements, rather than concentrate solely on a rail system. Lanier soon became chairman of the Metro system board. The mayor fired Lanier from his Metro position in December 1989. It proved to be fatal to Whitmire&#x27;s political future. Unable to find another satisfactory candidate for her office, Lanier decided to challenge her himself. The hot-button issues for the 1991 election became fear of street crime and skepticism about the functionality of an expensive monorail system proposed by Whitmire. Lanier promised to cancel the latter and put more police on the streets. Lanier made inroads into Whitmire&#x27;s white supporters, while a black candidate, Sylvester Turner, cut into her black support. She placed third with 20% of the vote and thus failed to make the run-off election. Lanier would go on to defeat Turner for the mayoralty.

===After the mayorship===
After the 1991 election, Whitmire turned her talents to teaching at Rice University, Harvard University and the University of Maryland. At Rice, she served as director of the Rice Institute for Policy Analysis and held the Tsanoff Lectureship in Public Affairs. In the latter position she taught courses in public policy, management, and political science. In 1994, she was appointed president and CEO of Junior Achievement. In 1995 and 1996, Whitmire served as lecturer on Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and was a Fellow at Harvard&#x27;s Institute of Politics. In 1997, she accepted a position at the newly formed Academy of Leadership at the University of Maryland College Park campus. She is credited with attracting former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley to join the academy as a scholar and chairman of the board.

Unlike most of Houston&#x27;s former mayors who are still living, Whitmire has moved away from the city. She has said that she has no plans to return, although she visits the city regularly to see family and friends. In 2001, Whitmire moved to Hawaii, where she became an active investor in real estate. She married Alan J. Whelms in 2002. Whitmire commutes by air to work at the University of Maryland, where she is a professor at the James MacGregor Burns Academy of Leadership. On July 1, 2005, Whitmire became the volunteer president of The Outdoor Circle, an organization dedicated to preserving Hawaii&#x27;s beauty by eliminating outdoor blight.

When Annise Parker, Whitmire&#x27;s long-time friend and supporter, ran for mayor of Houston in 2009, Whitmire flew there to show her support by hosting a fund raiser. Parker ultimately won the election and became the city&#x27;s first gay mayor. In 2023, Whitmire&#x27;s former brother-in-law John Whitmire ran for the office, and won after a runoff on December 9, 2023, against U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee.

==Awards and honors==
Whitmire has received numerous awards for her efforts and accomplishments, including:
* Public Service Award from the American Society of Women CPAs (1984)
* International Business Award from the Houston World Trade Association (1985)
* Michael A. DiNunzio Award for Partnerships for Youth from the U.S. Conference of Mayors (1985)
* Distinguished Professional Woman by the Committee on the Status of Women at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston(1987)
* Institute of Human Relations Award from the International New Thought Alliance (1986)
* Distinguished Sales Award by the Sales and Marketing Executives Society of Houston for her economic development efforts for Houston. (1987)
* In 1985, Whitmire received the Michael A. DiNunzio Award for Partnerships for Youth from the U.S. Conference of Mayors
* In 1987, she co-chaired the National League of Cities&#x27; (NLC) International Economic Development Task Force and
* was the 1987 chair of the NLC&#x27;s Finance, Administration and Intergovernmental Relations Steering Committee
* Served as second vice-president on the board of directors of the Texas Municipal League and was a member of the board of trustees of the UH Foundation and the executive committee of the Houston Economic Development Council
* Inducted into the Houston Hall of Fame on August 26, 2010

==Political legacy==
Soon after Whitmire left office, Bob Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, said that her legacy was to make the city operate more efficiently, citing improvements in fundamental operations like garbage collection and public transportation. He added, &quot;She brought (Houston) into the 21st Century (&quot;sic&quot;) in city administration.&quot; His concluding opinion was, &quot;I think she really was one of the great administrative mayors of this city&#x27;s history, maybe the finest.&quot;

The &quot;good old boy network&quot; that once controlled city politics has lost much of its political clout. It can no longer count on support by the local news media. Many of the reforms that occurred during that period are still in effect. Elected city offices are still more open to minority candidates. There have been two African-Americans (Lee P. Brown and Sylvester Turner) and one woman (Annise Parker) elected to the mayor&#x27;s office. A number of minority members have been elected as council members and as city controller.

<text>Pinus parviflora, also known as five-needle pine, or Japanese white pine, is a pine in the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, native to Japan.

It is a coniferous evergreen tree, growing to 15–25 m in height and is usually as broad as it is tall, forming a wide, dense, conical crown. The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of five, with a length of 5–6 cm. The cones are 4–7 cm long, with broad, rounded scales; the seeds are 8–11 mm long, with a vestigial 2–10 mm wing.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;parviflora&quot; means &quot;with small flowers&quot;.

This is a popular tree for bonsai, and is also grown as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. The cultivars &#x27;Adcock&#x27;s Dwarf&#x27; and &#x27;Bonnie Bergman&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="509818" wikidata="Q107067" url="?curid=509818" title="Jagjit Singh">
<text>Jagjit Singh (born Jagmohan Singh Dhiman; 8 February 1941 – 10 October 2011) was an Indian composer, singer and musician. He composed and sang in numerous languages and is credited for the revival and popularity of ghazal, an Indian classical art form, by choosing poetry that was relevant to the masses and composing them in a way that laid more emphasis on the meaning of words and melody evoked by them. In terms of Indian classical music, his style of composing and &quot;gayaki&quot; (singing) is considered as &quot;Bol-pradhan&quot;, one that lays emphasis on words. He highlighted this in his music for films such as &quot;Prem Geet&quot; (1981), &quot;Arth (1982)&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Saath Saath&quot;&quot; (1982), and TV serials &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; (1988) and &quot;Kahkashan&quot; (1991). Singh is considered to be among the most successful ghazal singers and composers of all time in terms of critical acclaim and commercial success. With a career spanning five decades and many albums, the range and breadth of his work has been regarded as genre-defining.

Singh&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;Beyond Time&quot;, was the first digitally recorded release in India. He was regarded as one of India&#x27;s most influential artists. With sitar player Ravi Shankar and other leading figures of Indian classical music and literature, Singh voiced his concerns over politicisation of arts and culture in India and lack of support experienced by the practitioners of India&#x27;s traditional art forms, particularly folk artists and musicians. He lent active support to several philanthropic endeavours such as the library at St. Mary&#x27;s School, Mumbai, Bombay Hospital, CRY, Save the Children and ALMA.

Singh was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the government of India in 2003 and in February 2014, the government released a set of two postal stamps in his honour.

==Early life and career==

Jagjit Singh Dhiman was born on 8 February 1941 in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, India (then Bikaner State) into a Namdhari Sikh Punjabi family. His father, Sardar Amar Singh Dhiman, was a surveyor with the government&#x27;s Public Works&#x27; Department and hailed from village Dalla in Ropar district of Punjab.

Educated initially at Khalsa High School and Government College in Sri Ganganagar, Singh obtained an arts degree from DAV College, Jalandhar. There, he began his professional career in 1961 by undertaking singing and composing assignments at All India Radio&#x27;s (AIR) Jalandhar station. Later, he studied to obtain a post-graduate degree in history from Kurukshetra University in Haryana. Throughout this time, and as a consequence of a natural talent that was spotted by his father, Singh learned music initially from a visually impaired master of Indian classical music, &quot;Pandit Chagan Lal Sharma&quot; and later from &quot;Ustad Jamal Khan&quot; of Maihar gharana, who taught and trained him in all the prominent styles of Hindustani Classical vocal tradition such as Khayal, Dhrupad, Thumri and others. Throughout his teenage years, he performed on stage and composed music. Although his father, who was a government employee, had hoped that he would become an engineer, Singh pursued his passion for music relentlessly. Like all parents in Indian middle-class families, his father aspired for him to become a bureaucrat. However, he also encouraged Singh and his siblings to learn music.

In March 1965, and without the knowledge of his family, Singh moved to Bombay, where there were many opportunities for music artists because of the Hindi film industry. He obtained work initially as a singer of advertising jingles and later progressed to playback singing.

==Achievement==

Singh was still struggling to make a living in 1967 when he met the Bengali-born Chitra Dutta. She divorced her husband and married Singh in December 1969. Following the birth of their son, Vivek, the couple performed as a singing duo but it was not until the 1977 release of the album &quot;The Unforgettable&quot; that they found significant, and surprising, success. In the interval, the primary difficulty for them had been that the ghazal music genre was dominated by Muslim artists and especially those from Pakistan.

&quot;The Unforgettable&quot;, which was the couple&#x27;s first LP, was an unconventional recording and it turned them into stars. The song &quot;Baat Niklegi&quot; from the album achieved great popularity for the Singhs. &quot;The Independent&quot; described it in 2011 as &quot;ground-breaking ... it became a transformative, before-and-after milestone in the history of Indian popular and ghazals music. It remains that.&quot; Using modern arrangements, it consists of ten tracks that include two on which they sang as a duo and the remainder equally split between Jagjit and Chitra singing the lead. &quot;The Independent&quot; further noted that &quot;This format of solo and duet performances from the first commercially successful husband-and-wife team in Indian popular music proved astonishingly successful.&quot; Jagjit explained that &quot;I was determined to polish up the genre and make it more acceptable to modern tastes, so chose simple poems and set them to simple tunes. I also introduced western instrumentation to make them livelier.&quot; Thereafter, the couple worked both on solo and joint musical projects and performed concerts worldwide. There was success from involvement with the film industry and they amassed considerable wealth.

Among their subsequent duo recordings of the 1970s were &quot;Shiv Kumar Batalvi – Birha da Sultan&quot; (1978), &quot;Live in Concert at Wembley&quot; (1979) and &quot;Come Alive&quot; (1979). Of those released in the 1980s, &quot;The Latest&quot; by Sudarshan Faakir was the best selling album with his lifetime hit &quot;Woh Kagaz ki Kashti...Woh Baarish ka Paani&quot;. It was the first album by the duo with poetry of only one Poet. &quot;Ecstasies&quot; (1984) has also been described as &quot;one of their finest&quot;. The joint projects ceased in 1990 when their 20-year-old son, Vivek, died in a road accident. Chitra felt unable to sing following these events. Monica, Chitra&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage, committed suicide in 2009.

Although Jagjit continued to work and to have success after Chitra withdrew from public life he, too, was affected by the death of Vivek. &quot;The Guardian&quot; notes that he &quot;suffered from deep depression and his anguish was often evident in his live performances.&quot; Aside from occupying himself with solo projects, which he performed in several languages, he collaborated with Lata Mangeshkar on an album titled &quot;Sajda&quot;, an Urdu word meaning &quot;prostration&quot;.

Singh&#x27;s work in film encompassed playback singing for productions such as &quot;Arth&quot;, &quot;&quot;Saath Saath&quot;&quot; and &quot;Premgeet&quot;. He composed all of the songs for the latter, as well as for the TV serial &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; that was based on the life of the eponymous poet, Mirza Ghalib.

On 10 May 2007, in the presence of numerous political and diplomatic luminaries at an event held in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India, Jagjit Singh rendered Bahadur Shah Zafar&#x27;s famous ghazal &quot;Lagta nahin hai dil mera&quot; to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

==Personal life==
In 1990, Vivek Singh (Jagjit Singh and Chitra&#x27;s son) died in a road accident at the age of 20. This came as a profound shock to Jagjit and Chitra Singh. They gave up music for a full year after the death. At the end of that period, Jagjit returned slowly to music, but Chitra announced her retirement and declared that she would not sing or record any more songs. In 2009, his step-daughter, Monica Chowdhary, aged 50, died by suicide.

Singh had suffered from numerous ailments like diabetes and hypertension during his later life, and had undergone two heart bypass surgeries in 1998 and 2007. A chain smoker for decades, he had stopped smoking after his first heart attack.

==Death==
Singh turned 70 in February 2011. To celebrate his 70th birthday he committed 70 concerts in different parts of the world. He toured the UK, Singapore, Mauritius, inter alias, in 2011 and was due to perform with Ghulam Ali in Mumbai but suffered a brain haemorrhage on 23 September 2011. He was in a coma for over two weeks and died on 10 October at Lilavati Hospital, in Mumbai. He was cremated the following day at Chandanwadi Crematorium near Marine Lines in Mumbai.

A number of tributes have been paid to Singh after his death, and some tried to cash in on his popularity, which was criticised by his wife.

==Legacy==
A biography of Singh, entitled &quot;Beyond Time&quot; based on about 40 hours of interviews with him, was released in 2012. It was transcribed and edited by Ashrani Mathur.
A biopic documentary by the name of &quot;Kaagaz Ki Kashti&quot; has been made on the life journey of Jagjit Singh, who broke through the norms and revolutionised the Ghazal scenario. The film traces the struggle and stardom in his musical career, the love &amp; loss in his personal life and the scope and limitations in the music scenario of the times. The film directed by Brahmanand S Singh is currently available on Amazon Prime Video in India and worldwide.

<doc id="509819" wikidata="Q4222969" url="?curid=509819" title="John Clarke (Baptist minister)">
<text>John Clarke (October 1609 – 20 April 1676) was a physician, politician, and Baptist minister, who was co-founder of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, author of its influential charter, and a leading advocate of religious freedom in America.

Clarke was born in Westhorpe, Suffolk, England. He received an extensive education, including a master&#x27;s degree in England followed by medical training in Leiden, Holland. He arrived at the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637 during the Antinomian Controversy and decided to go to Aquidneck Island with many exiles from the conflict. He became a co-founder of Portsmouth and Newport, Rhode Island, and he established America&#x27;s second Baptist church in Newport. Baptists were considered heretics and were banned from Massachusetts, but Clarke wanted to make inroads there and spent time in the Boston jail after making a mission trip to the town of Lynn, Massachusetts. Following his poor treatment in prison, he went to England where he published a book on the persecutions of the Baptists in Massachusetts and on his theological beliefs. The fledgling Rhode Island colony needed an agent in England, so he remained there for more than a decade handling the colony&#x27;s interests.

The other New England colonies were hostile to Rhode Island, and both Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut Colony had made incursions into Rhode Island territory. After the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660, it was imperative that Rhode Island receive a royal charter to protect its territorial integrity. It was Clarke&#x27;s role to obtain such a document, and he saw this as an opportunity to include religious freedoms never seen before in any constitutional charter. He wrote ten petitions and letters to King Charles II and negotiated for months with Connecticut over territorial boundaries. Finally, he drafted the Rhode Island Royal Charter and presented it to the king, and it was approved with the king&#x27;s seal on 8 July 1663. This charter granted unprecedented freedom and religious liberty to Rhode Islanders and remained in effect for 180 years, making it the longest-lasting constitutional charter in history.

Clarke returned to Rhode Island following his success at procuring the charter; he became very active in civil affairs there, and continued to pastor his church in Newport until his death in 1676. He left an extensive will, setting up the first educational trust in America. He was an avid proponent of the notion of soul-liberty that was included in the Rhode Island charter—and later in the United States Constitution.

== Early life ==

John Clarke was born at Westhorpe in the county of Suffolk, England, and was baptized there on 8 October 1609. He was one of seven children of Thomas Clarke and Rose Kerrich (or Kerridge), six of whom left England and settled in New England. No definitive record has been found concerning his life in England other than the parish records of his baptism and those of his siblings.

Clarke was apparently highly educated, judging from the fact that he arrived in New England at the age of 28 qualified as both a physician and a Baptist minister. His many years of study become evident through a book that he wrote and published in 1652, and through his masterful authorship of the Rhode Island Royal Charter of 1663; further, his will mentions his Hebrew and Greek books, as well as a concordance and lexicon that he wrote himself.

The difficulty with tracing Clarke&#x27;s life in England stems largely from his very common name. Rhode Island historian George Andrews Moriarty, Jr wrote that this was probably the same John Clarke who attended St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, but he may also have received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brasenose College, Oxford in 1628 and a master&#x27;s degree there in 1632. Another clue to his education comes from a catalog of students from Leiden University in Holland, one of Europe&#x27;s primary medical schools at the time. The school&#x27;s ledger of graduates includes, in Latin, &quot;Johannes Clarcq, Anglus, 17 July 1635-273&quot; (translated as John Clark, England). It is apparent that Clarke earned a master&#x27;s degree from the concordance that he wrote, where the authorship is given as &quot;John Clarke, Master of Arts&quot;.

== Rhode Island ==
Clarke arrived in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in November 1637 when the colony was in the midst of the major theological and political crisis known as the Antinomian Controversy. A major division had occurred within the Boston church between proponents of so-called &quot;covenant of grace&quot; theology, led by John Cotton, and proponents of so-called &quot;covenant of works&quot;, led by John Wilson and others.

The controversy ultimately resulted in many people leaving Massachusetts Bay Colony, either voluntarily or by banishment. Some went north in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter, New Hampshire, while a larger group were uncertain where to go. They contacted Roger Williams, who suggested that they purchase land from the Narragansett people along the Narragansett Bay, near his settlement of Providence Plantations. John Clarke apparently went with both groups, based on what he wrote in his book: &quot;By reason of the suffocating heat of the summer before [1637], I went to the North to be somewhat cooler, but the winter following [1637–38] proved so cold, that we were forced in the spring to make towards the South.&quot;

Clarke joined a group of men at the Boston home of William Coddington on 7 March 1638, and they drafted the Portsmouth Compact. Some historians suggest that Clarke wrote the document, based on its religious sentiment. 23 men signed the document which was intended to form a &quot;Bodie Politick&quot; based on Christian principles, and Coddington was chosen as the leader of the group.

Roger Williams suggested two places where the exiles could settle on the Narraganset Bay: Sowams (which became Barrington and Warren, Rhode Island) and Aquidneck Island (which was called Rhode Island at the time). Williams was uncertain about English claims to these lands, so Clarke led a delegation of three men to Plymouth Colony where he was informed that Sowams was under their jurisdiction but Aquidneck Island was not. This suited Clarke, whose desire for the exiles was to &quot;get clear of all, and be ourselves&quot;. Aquidneck was in the territory of the Narragansett people, and Williams suggested that the Colonists pay them for the land with tools, coats, and wampum. On 24 March 1638, Williams drew up the deed granting Aquidneck Island to the settlers, which was signed &quot;at Narragansett&quot; (likely Providence) by sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi, with Williams and Randall Holden as witnesses. The names of many of the settlers were included on the deed; Coddington&#x27;s name appeared first because he was responsible for the gratuity.

Clarke joined William and Anne Hutchinson and many others in building the new settlement of Pocasset on Aquidneck Island. Within a year, however, there was dissension among the leaders, and Clarke joined Coddington and others in moving to the south end of the island, establishing the town of Newport. On 2 January 1639, Clarke and three others were appointed to survey the new lands around Newport, and they were appointed to proportion it among the inhabitants on 5 June.

In 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport united and Coddington was elected its governor. Roger Williams wanted royal recognition for these settlements and protection against encroachments from their neighbors of Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut. In 1643, he went to England to obtain a patent bringing all four towns (Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and Warwick) under one government. Coddington was opposed to the patent because the two island towns had grown and prospered much more than the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick. He managed to keep the island towns separate until 1647 when the four towns finally adopted the patent and became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

Clarke had some legal training, and historian Albert Henry Newman argued that he was the principal author of the first complete code of laws that was enacted by the fledgling colony in 1647. Rhode Island historian and Lieutenant Governor Samuel G. Arnold extolled the virtues of this code, calling it a model of legislation which has not been surpassed.

== Founding of the Newport church ==

In 1638, Roger Williams established a church in Providence which is now known as the First Baptist Church in America. The next Baptist congregation was established by John Clarke on Rhode Island and likely had its beginnings when he arrived on the island in 1638. Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop wrote that there were &quot;professed Anabaptists&quot; on the island from 1640 to 1641. Boston lawyer Thomas Lechford wrote that there was a church on the island in 1640 of which Clarke was the elder or pastor, but he understood that it had been dissolved. Nevertheless, Clarke conducted public worship in Newport from the time of his arrival until 1644, when a church at Newport was founded. The church remains active as a Reformed Baptist Church and carries the name of United Baptist Church, John Clarke Memorial in honor of its founder.

== Baptist activism ==
In 1649, Clarke went to Seekonk (then in Plymouth Colony but later in Rehoboth, Massachusetts) to help organize a Baptist church. Roger Williams confirmed this in a letter to Governor Winthrop: &quot;At Seekonk, a great many have lately concurred with Mr. John Clarke, and our Providence men, about the point of a new baptism and the manner by dipping; and Mr. John Clarke hath been there lately, and Mr. Lucar, and hath dipped them. I believe their practice comes nearer to the first practice of our great Founder, Christ Jesus, than other practices of religion do.&quot; Several members of the Seekonk church had quarreled with their minister Samuel Newman and had broken off from the main church, largely over the issue of infant baptism. Hearing of this division, Clarke and Lucar went to welcome the dissidents and baptize them by immersion. One of the Seekonk men was Obadiah Holmes who is considered a &quot;pugnacious man [and] a hot-tempered fault-finder&quot; by Clarke biographer Sydney James.

The Massachusetts clergymen and magistrates were angered when they learned of the Seekonk baptisms. In their eyes, they invalidated the earlier baptisms which the parishioners had undergone as children, and also invalidated the ministers who performed them. The magistrates wrote to their counterparts in Plymouth accusing them of doing nothing about the practices. The Seekonk church then excommunicated Holmes and he was compelled to move to Newport in 1650 or 1651 with a few other dissidents, following court action against him. He subsequently became an elder of the Newport church.

=== Imprisonment ===

William Witter was an elderly blind man with Baptist sentiments who was living in Lynn, Massachusetts in July 1651. He wanted to connect with his Baptist faith, but he was too infirm to travel to Newport, so Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall visited him at his home. The party arrived on Saturday 19 July and held a religious service the next day. Those present included family and visitors and &quot;four or five strangers that came in unexpected&quot;. During the service, two constables appeared with a warrant signed by local magistrate Robert Bridge calling for the arrest of Clarke and his two associates. No baptisms had been performed, but the wording of the warrant suggested that this was the reason for the men&#x27;s arrest. The men were forced to attend a Puritan religious service against their will, and they refused to remove their hats in church. Clarke stood at the end of the service and explained to the congregation why they refused to remove their hats. The men were detained that evening, then brought before the local magistrates the following day. They were free to return to Witter&#x27;s after being arraigned and before being taken to Boston. Clarke conducted a service and Holmes baptized three people.

The prisoners were taken to Boston on 22 July and held until their trial on 31 July. They were brought before Governor John Endicott for questioning and were accused of being Anabaptists. Clarke replied that he was neither an Anabaptist, nor a Pedobaptist (one favoring infant baptism), nor a Catabaptist (one opposing infant baptism). The governor said that the three men &quot;deserved death, and he would not have such trash brought into his jurisdiction.&quot;

During the trial, the court was represented by Governor Endicott, Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley, and magistrates Richard Bellingham, William Hibbins, and Increase Nowell. The Reverend John Cotton weighed in with denunciation for the prisoners, and the Reverend John Wilson struck Holmes while he was in the protection of the court. The men were charged with: (1) holding an unauthorized religious meeting; (2) disrupting an authorized meeting (wearing their hats); (3) administering sacraments illegally; (4) maintaining that the Massachusetts churches were not true churches; and (5) maintaining that infant baptism was false baptism. The men were sentenced without any accuser or witness speaking out against them.

The outcome of the trial was that Holmes was fined £30, Clarke £20, and Crandall £5. Holmes had been given the heaviest fine because of his excommunication in Seekonk and for administering the baptisms in Lynn. Clarke protested their heavy fines, and Governor Endicott replied that Clarke &quot;was worthy to be hanged.&quot; In court, Endicott told Clarke that his beliefs would not stand up to those of the Puritan ministers. Clarke responded to this by writing a letter to the court from prison the following day, accepting the implied challenge to have a debate with the Puritan ministers on religious beliefs and practices. The challenge was initially accepted, but Clarke&#x27;s fine was paid by some friends without his knowledge and he was released from jail. He left the area, and was then accused by the Puritan elders of defaulting on the challenge. He made two more attempts to debate the Puritan clergy, but the case was dropped by the court and the debate never took place. Clarke had drafted four points of discussion which detailed his beliefs and position.

Friends raised the money to pay the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but without their consent and contrary to their wishes. As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening, he was able to forbid the payment of his fine as a matter of conscience, though friends attempted to pay for him as well. As a result, Holmes was taken to the town&#x27;s whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. He told the magistrates, &quot;You have struck me as with roses&quot;, and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by resting on his knees and elbows for many days afterwards. Much later, Rhode Island Governor Joseph Jenckes wrote, &quot;Those who have seen the scars on Mr. Holmes&#x27; back (which the old man was wont to call the marks of the Lord Jesus), have expressed a wonder that he should live.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===

Following the men&#x27;s arrest and ill treatment, Sir Richard Saltonstall wrote from England to Reverends Cotton and Wilson of the Boston church: &quot;These rigid wayes have lay&#x27;d you very lowe in the hearts of the saynts.&quot; Shortly after the incident, Roger Williams wrote a letter to Governor Endicott, making an earnest plea for toleration in matters of conscience and religion, but the request was unheeded. However, Williams did not let the matter rest, and used Clarke and Holmes as the subjects of his book &quot;The Bloody Tenent Yet More Bloody&quot; (1652). Williams gave a copy of this book to Clarke and wrote in the front: &quot;For his honoured and beloved Mr. John Clarke, an eminent witnes of Christ Jesus ag&#x27;st ye bloodie Doctrine of persecution, &amp;c.&quot;

One positive outcome of the ordeal endured by these men was the conversion and baptism of some of the witnesses. One such witness was Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard College. Dunster&#x27;s conversion in faith resulted in his removal as president in 1654, but helped inspire the creation of the First Baptist Church of Boston. Some scholars have argued that Clarke&#x27;s mission trip was planned to provoke the Massachusetts officials in order to support the cause of Rhode Island in England. Shortly after Clarke arrived in England, he published &quot;Ill Newes from New-England, documenting the ordeal at the hands of the Massachusetts authorities&quot;. The book was an appeal to the English government outlining the case for religious tolerance, and it was instrumental in shaping public opinion and generating support for a charter for the Rhode Island colony.

== Time in England ==

William Coddington was unhappy with the colonial patent that Roger Williams had obtained in 1643, and he was resistant to consolidating the four settlements into the unified Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which ultimately came about in 1647 as a result of the patent. He wanted colonial independence for the two island towns of Newport and Portsmouth, and decided to go to England to present his case to the Colonial Commissioners in London. On 3 April 1651, the Council of State of England gave Coddington the commission of a separate government for the island of Aquidneck and for the smaller neighboring island of Conanicut (later Jamestown, Rhode Island), with him as governor for life.

=== Repeal of Coddington Commission ===

Criticism arose as soon as Coddington returned to Rhode Island with his commission. In September 1651, William Arnold summed up the feelings of many of the Providence settlers when he wrote, &quot;Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Road Iland and Conimacuke Iland to himself, he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went under the name of Providence, because he have gotten away the greater part of that colonie.&quot; Clarke voiced his opposition to Coddington&#x27;s rule of the island, and he was commissioned as the island&#x27;s agent to England on 15 October 1651. The following month, he and William Dyer were sent to England to get the Coddington commission revoked. Simultaneously, the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick sent Roger Williams on a similar errand, and the three men sailed for England in November 1651, just a few months after Clarke had been released from prison. The men did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652 because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch.

Coddington&#x27;s commission for the island government was revoked in October 1652, with the help of Henry Vane. William Dyer returned to Rhode Island the following February, bringing the news of the return of the colony to the Williams Patent of 1643, but Clarke remained in England with his wife.

=== &quot;Ill Newes from New England&quot; ===

Very soon after arriving in England, Clarke published &quot;Ill Newes from New England: or a Narrative of New England&#x27;s Persecution&quot; (1652). The book begins with a letter to the English Parliament and Council of State, conveying an earnest plea for liberty of conscience and religious toleration. This is followed by another letter addressed to the Puritan leaders in Massachusetts. The largest part of the book is devoted to Clarke&#x27;s beliefs on conducting a church and why he thought that the Massachusetts churches were proceeding in the wrong direction. Less than half of the book concerns the persecution that Clarke and his companions experienced at the hands of the Massachusetts authorities. He wrote, &quot;it is not the will of the Lord that any one should have dominion over another man&#x27;s conscience. ... [Conscience] is such a sparkling beam from the Father of lights and spirits that it cannot be lorded over, commanded, or forced, either by men, devils, or angels.&quot;

The book ultimately had the desired effect. The Massachusetts authorities became so alarmed over the contents of &quot;Ill Newes&quot; that Thomas Cobbet, the minister of the Lynn church, wrote a rebuttal entitled &quot;The Civil Magistrates Power in Matters of Religion Modestly Debated&quot; (1653). This book defended the use of force to maintain the &quot;correct&quot; church in the Massachusetts colony. This response was well written, but it did more to confirm the persecutions of Clarke&#x27;s party than to defend the Massachusetts position. Ultimately, the book helped Rhode Island secure significant religious liberties, prompting one Baptist historian to describe Clarke as &quot;the Baptist drum major for freedom in seventeenth century America.&quot;

=== Rhode Island agent ===

Clarke was Rhode Island&#x27;s official agent in England, although he received little compensation for his work. However, he remained active in his religious commitment and joined a Particular Baptist church under the pastorship of William Kiffin. One of his means of support was preaching at this church, which he called his &quot;cheefe place for proffitt and preference&quot;, possibly because this arrangement offered him room and board. He also offered legal services and practiced medicine in London.

Most of Clarke&#x27;s time in England was during the Interregnum, when rule of the country was under Parliament and Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector. Clarke&#x27;s primary purpose there was to secure a strengthened charter for the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ensuring the religious liberties on which the colony had been founded, and Cromwell confirmed the validity of Rhode Island&#x27;s 1643 patent. Clarke also assisted the colony in 1656 by sending home four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and bullets, and in 1657 he handled a letter from the colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris.

An important acquaintance of Clarke&#x27;s in London was Richard Baily, who provided him with legal expertise, helped him draft petitions to the king, and may have even helped him write Rhode Island&#x27;s charter. When Clarke eventually returned to Newport, Baily sailed with him, later providing additional legal counsel and writing Clarke&#x27;s extensive will.

=== Negotiating a charter ===

In 1660, Charles II ascended the throne of England, and within two years the Act of Uniformity was passed requiring unified religious observances centered on the Anglican Church. The new king harbored prejudices against the Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists, increasing Clarke&#x27;s difficulty in crafting a charter that included religious freedoms. Clarke&#x27;s commission as the agent for Rhode Island was renewed on 18 October 1660, and he filed at least ten petitions and letters to the king between 1661 and 1662. He offered the king the complete loyalty of the Rhode Island colony, and then requested the king&#x27;s sympathy and support to guarantee freedom of conscience in the pursuit of religious worship.

Clarke wrote a particularly eloquent proposal in a petition received by the crown on 5 February 1661, with certain words emboldened within the document. His earnest request was &quot;TO HOLD FORTH A LIVELY EXPERIMENT THAT A MOST FLOURISHING CIVILL STATE MAY STAND ... AND BEST BE MAINTAYNED ... WITH A FULL LIBERTIE IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNMENTS&quot;. These words became emblematic of Rhode Island&#x27;s struggle for religious freedom and were soon included in the charter itself—and much later were chiseled on the frieze of the Rhode Island State House. One of the later petitions dealt heavily with the boundary issues between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies. Clarke had to wait nearly a year for any action on the various petitions.

An unforeseen emergency occurred in the spring of 1662 when Connecticut Colony Governor John Winthrop, Jr. was given an audience with the king ahead of Clarke, and he obtained a new charter for his colony. Winthrop was on good terms with many Rhode Islanders, but he also had a stake in the Atherton Company, which undermined the sovereignty of Rhode Island by buying large tracts of land from the Narragansett people west of the Narraganset Bay, where Rhode Island claimed the territory. Clarke regarded Winthrop&#x27;s conduct as treacherous, and Winthrop avoided Clarke while in England; he was able to get his charter approved in May 1662.

The Earl of Clarendon recognized the conflict between Connecticut and Rhode Island. He summoned Winthrop and Clarke in July 1662, representing the king in hopes of settling the boundary dispute between the two colonies. Both colonies claimed the territory between the Pawcatuck River and the Narragansett Bay. The boundary line between the two colonies was ultimately set at the Pawcatuck River, after months of negotiations involving lawyers and arbitrators on both sides. Those who had settled on Atherton Company lands were allowed to choose whether to be governed by Connecticut or Rhode Island. Once the agreement was reached, Winthrop returned to New England while Clarke made his final push for Rhode Island&#x27;s charter.

Following all the furore over the land boundaries, none of the other provisions of the proposed charter aroused any debate. Many of the provisions of Rhode Island&#x27;s charter were like those in Connecticut&#x27;s, except that Connecticut wanted a government similar to that of Massachusetts, while Rhode Island wanted the same self-government of the freemen that had been granted earlier in the 1643 patent. However, the Rhode Island charter went much further in its guarantees of religious freedom.

== Rhode Island&#x27;s Royal Charter ==

Once the boundary issue between Rhode Island and Connecticut was resolved, the long-awaited charter, drafted by Clarke, was given the king&#x27;s seal on 8 July 1663. The document was remarkable in that it not only offered corporate powers beyond what most English bureaucrats thought prudent, but offered a degree of religious freedom without precedent. The provisions of this charter were so far-reaching that not only would Rhode Island proceed as an autonomous entity, but the document would remain in effect for 180 years.

In this charter, colonial boundaries were outlined, provisions for a military and for prosecuting war were effected, fishing privileges were secured, and a means of appeal to England was detailed. The charter guaranteed the rights of Rhode Island residents to travel freely within the other colonies, which rights had been curtailed due to religious reasons in the past. The new charter also forbade the other New England colonies from making war against the Indians within Rhode Island, without its permission, and also directed that disputes with other colonies would be appealed to the crown. It also outlined provisions for colonial representation, specifying a colonial governor, deputy governor, and ten assistants (called magistrates because of their judicial role). In addition, the number of deputies allotted to each town was specified.

Of paramount importance to Clarke was the charter&#x27;s explicit guarantee of religious freedom. It excused Rhode Islanders from conformity with the Anglican Church &quot;because some of the people ... cannot, in their private Opinions, conform to the publique exercise of religion ...&quot; It also took some of the language from the Declaration of Breda:

that no person within the said colony, at any time hereafter shall be any wise molested [harassed], punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinion in matters of religion, and do not actually disturb the civil peace of our said colony; but that all and every person and persons may, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments and consciences, in matters of religious concernments, throughout the tract of land hereafter mentioned, they behaving themselves peaceable and quietly ...

Once he had the cherished document in hand, it was imperative for Clarke to get it sent to Rhode Island. However, he had received very little remuneration for his diplomatic efforts and did not have the funds to immediately sail back to New England. He therefore entrusted the charter to Captain George Baxter, who carried it to Rhode Island. On 24 November 1663 Rhode Island&#x27;s General Court of Commissioners convened at Newport for the last time under the parliamentary patent of 1643. The inhabitants and legislators had gathered to receive the result of Clarke&#x27;s decade-long labors. The magnitude and solemnity of the occasion was captured in the colonial records:

At a very great meeting and assembly of the freemen of the colony of Providence Plantation, at Newport, in Rhode Island, in New England, November the 24th, 1663. The abovesayed Assembly being legally called and orderly mett for the sollome reception of his Majestyes gratious letter pattent unto them sent, and having in order thereto chosen the President, Benedict Arnold, Moderator of the Assembly, [it was] Voted: That the box in which the King&#x27;s gratious letters were enclosed be opened, and the letters with the broad seale thereto affixed be taken forth and read by Captayne George Baxter in the audience and view of all the people; which was accordingly done, and the sayd letters with his Majesty&#x27;s Royall Stampe, and the broad seal, with much becoming gravity held up on hygh, and presented to the perfect view of the people, and then returned into the box and locked up by the Governor, in order to the safe keeping of it.

The following day it was voted that words of humble thanks be delivered to the King and also to the Earl of Clarendon, and that a £100 gratuity be given to Clarke. The charter stood the test of time, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1843, 180 years after its creation, that the charter was finally replaced by the Constitution of Rhode Island, and only for the one reason that the apportionment of representatives for the several towns &quot;could no longer be rendered as just in operation and could only be remedied by alteration of the organic law.&quot; When the document was ultimately retired, it was the longest surviving constitutional charter in the world. It was so far-reaching that even the American Revolutionary War did not change its position, since both the revolution and the charter rested on the same foundation—the inherent right of self-government.

== Later life ==

With the royal charter ready to travel to New England, Clarke had to begin gathering funds to get himself back as well. Only a week after the king put his seal on the charter, Clarke made an indenture with Richard Deane of London, mortgaging his Newport properties to raise money. Even this didn&#x27;t ensure his immediate departure from England, and it wasn&#x27;t until the following spring that he was able to make the voyage back to Rhode Island. He and his wife sailed aboard &quot;The Sisters&quot; of London, carrying their belongings and a shipment of armaments for the colony.

Despite the magnanimous provisions of Rhode Island&#x27;s charter, it did not definitively settle the land disputes with Connecticut, which would continue for more than half a century. Nor did it settle the issue with the Atherton Company, occupying two large tracts of land within Rhode Island&#x27;s &quot;Narragansett country&quot;. Fortuitous for the Rhode Island colony, however, was the arrival in 1664 of a group of royal commissioners. Samuel Gorton had told the crown that in 1644 the Narragansett people had submitted themselves to England&#x27;s king. Once the newly arrived commissioners verified this, they declared all of the Narragansett territory (what is now Washington County and a part of Kent County, Rhode Island, including the Atherton tracts), to be Kings Province. One of the commissioners was Samuel Maverick, a good friend of Rhode Island&#x27;s recent governor William Brenton, who abhorred the Atherton Company. Clarke was one of three men allowed to present Rhode Island&#x27;s views on the land disputes, and the commissioners ultimately took a strong stance in favor of Rhode Island. Eventually, the Atherton Company lost its Narragansett property, and the Kings Province became a part of the Rhode Island colony.

=== Civil roles ===

Following his great usefulness in England, Clarke became further involved in the affairs of the Rhode Island colony upon his return. He served for six years, from 1664 to 1671, as a Deputy from Newport in the General Assembly, and then served as the Deputy Governor under Governor Benedict Arnold for two of the three years between 1669 and 1672. With his legal background, he was appointed in October 1666 to make a digest of Rhode Island laws. In June 1670 and again in March 1672 he was chosen as an agent to go back to England on behalf of the colony. His selection in 1672 was to make an appeal to the king because of incursions that the Connecticut Colony was making into the territory of Rhode Island, but the plan to send him was abandoned.

From 1675 to 1676, Rhode Island became embroiled in King Philip&#x27;s War, considered &quot;the most disastrous conflict to ever devastate New England,&quot; and leaving the mainland towns of the colony in ruins. This confrontation between many indigenous people and the English settlers was named for Metacomet, sachem of the Wampanoags, who had been given the English name of King Philip. Though Rhode Island was much more at peace with the Indians than the other colonies, because of geography, it took the brunt of damage from the conflict, and the settlements of Warwick and Pawtuxet were totally destroyed, with much of Providence ruined as well. Because of the very high esteem Clarke held within the colony, he was one of 16 colonial leaders whose counsel was sought in a 4 April 1676 General Assembly resolution. Two weeks later, while the war was still raging, Clarke was dead.

=== Church divisions ===

While Clarke became very active in the affairs of the colony upon his return from England, he also resumed his leadership role in the Newport church. One major schism occurred in the church while he was in England, and another several years after his return. The first of these concerned the &quot;laying on of hands&quot;. This practice was considered to be one of Christ&#x27;s six principles as advocated in the biblical verse Hebrews 6:2, and the ritual was welcomed in the Newport Baptist Church. However, some members of the church wanted the practice to be mandatory, while others did not want additional restrictions placed on the parishioners. This disagreement prompted William Vaughan to break away from the church in 1656 and form his own &quot;Six Principle&quot; Baptist Church in Newport, sometimes called the Second Baptist Church of Newport.

The second major division in the church occurred over the day of worship, when Sabbatarians within the congregation wanted to worship on Saturday. The practice was largely tolerated, with some parishioners attending one service, some attending another, and some attending both. The elder Obadiah Holmes, however, was hostile to the practice, and was rebuked by Clarke in 1667 over his harshness towards the Sabbatarians. Holmes subsequently withdrew from preaching at the Newport church, but resumed his pastoral duties there in 1671. When he continued to be critical of the Sabbatarians, they finally left to form their own church in December 1671. Additional dissension occurred in the church, centered on the family of Giles Slocum. When Slocum&#x27;s wife, Joan, denied that Christ was alive, she was excommunicated in 1673. Following this, her husband, their children, and their children&#x27;s spouses all left the church, and became Quakers.

== Death and legacy ==

With the help of Richard Baily, Clarke drafted his will on 20 April 1676, then died in Newport the same day. He was buried in his family plot in Newport, as directed in his will, beside his two wives, Elizabeth and Jane, who predeceased him.

In his will he set up a trust to be used &quot;for the relief of the poor or bringing up of children unto learning from time to time forever.&quot; Still in use, this trust is generally considered to be the oldest educational trust fund in the United States. Ironically, the trust undermined some of the principles that Clarke cherished, particularly the separation between church and state. While the trust was used to support ministries of the church, it enmeshed the town counsel and the church in many legal entanglements. Eventually the trust was used to pay, at least in part, the salary of a paid minister—something that Clarke thought to be highly inappropriate.

Clarke believed that secular government should peacefully coexist with religion, and he became a seminal figure in applying the separation of church and state. Historian Thomas Bicknell, one of Clarke&#x27;s most ardent supporters, wrote that at the time of the Puritan settlement of New England that &quot;nowhere on the face of the earth and among civilized men, did civil and soul-liberty exist. Its first clear, full, deliberate, organized and permanent establishment in the world can now be distinctly traced to the Colony of Rhode Island, on the island of Aquidneck, in the Narragansett Bay, under the leadership and inspiration of Dr. John Clarke, the true Founder&quot;. Historian Louis Asher wrote, &quot;It hardly seems arguable that Dr. Clarke was the first one to bring democracy to the New World by means of Rhode Island.&quot; Bicknell also asserted that Clarke was the &quot;recognized founder and father of the Aquidneck Plantations, the author of the Compact of Portsmouth and leading spirit in the organization and administration of the island towns. Historian Edward Peterson wrote that Clarke was a man &quot;whose moral character has never been surpassed, and his piety never been questioned.&quot; Asher made this final assessment of Clarke: &quot;As a man, Clarke lived for others. Like many men of the past, he was selfless and uncomplaining. Despite his sectarian religious views, he gave more for his fellow man than he received.&quot;

The First Baptist Church of Newport, a grammar school, and a merchant Liberty ship, the SS John Clarke, are named for Clarke. The Physical Sciences building at Rhode Island College was dedicated in his honor in 1963. A plaque on the wall of the Newport Historical Society reads:

== Ancestry and family ==

John Clarke was the fifth of seven known children born to Thomas and Rose Clarke, all born or baptized at Westhorpe, Suffolk, England. Margaret was the oldest child, born about 1601, and next was Carew, baptized 17 February 1602/3, followed by Thomas, baptized 31 March 1605. Mary was next, baptized 26 July 1607, then the subject John was baptized 8 October 1609, next was William baptized 11 February 1611 who probably died young, and the youngest, Joseph, was baptized on 16 December 1618. Margaret married Nicholas Wyeth and lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mary married John Peckham, and came to Newport, Rhode Island with her husband and four brothers, Carew, Thomas, John, and Joseph.

John Clarke was married three times, his first wife being Elizabeth Harris, the daughter of John Harris who was lord of the manor of Wrestlingworth in Bedfordshire. This was the wife who was with him while he was an agent in England, and she died in Newport a few years before Clarke. Following her death, he was married on 1 February 1671 to Jane, the widow of Nicholas Fletcher, but she died the following year on 19 April 1672. Clarke had a daughter with Jane, born 14 February 1672 and dying on 18 May 1673.

Clarke&#x27;s third wife was Sarah, the widow of Nicholas Davis, with whom Clarke had had a long association. Davis, like Clarke, had been an early settler of Aquidneck Island in 1639, but became a merchant and moved to Hyannis in the Plymouth Colony. Davis had many business dealings in Massachusetts, but when he became a Quaker, he was imprisoned and banished from there in 1659, and later lived in Newport. He transported Quaker founder George Fox from Long Island to Newport in 1672, during Fox&#x27;s visit to the American colonies. Soon thereafter Davis drowned, and within a year and a half his widow married Clarke. Sarah survived Clarke, and died sometime about 1692. She had children who were remembered in Clarke&#x27;s will.

== Notes ==

a. The complete title of Clarke&#x27;s book is &quot;Ill Newes from New-England: Or a Narrative of New-Englands Persecution. Wherin is Declared that While Old England is Becoming New, New-England is Become Old. Also Four Proposals to the Honoured Parliament and Councel of State, Touching the Way to Propagate the Gospel of Christ (with Small Charge and Great Safety) Both in Old England and New. Also Christ out of His Last Will and Testament, Confirmed and Justified&quot; (London: Henry Hills, 1652)

b. The title of Dr. has been given to John Clarke by many authors, because he was a physician. However, he was not a doctor of medicine in the modern sense, even though he had medical training and education. The title has not been used in this article, other than in quotations.

<text>India Shining, India Rising (Hindi: भारत उदय) was a marketing slogan referring to the overall feeling of economic optimism in India in 2004&quot;.&quot; The slogan was popularised by the then-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the 2004 Indian general elections. The slogan is initially developed as a part of an Indian government campaign intended to promote India internationally.

Advertising firm Grey Worldwide won the campaign account in 2003; the slogan and the associated campaign was developed by national creative director Prathap Suthan, in consultation with Finance Minister Jaswant Singh. The government spent an estimated 20 million USD of government funds on national television advertisements and newspaper ads featuring the &quot;India Shining&quot; slogan.

Some editorials also suggested that the India Shining campaign was one of the causes for the subsequent defeat of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in the 2004 parliamentary elections, particularly in urban areas, the target audience of the campaign.

The negative assessment of the India Shining campaign was echoed after the election by former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, who described it as &quot;valid,&quot; but &quot;inappropriate for our election campaign... By making them verbal icons of our election campaign, we gave our political opponents an opportunity to highlight other aspects of India&#x27;s contemporary reality... which questioned our claim.&quot;

== Controversy ==
There has been controversy over the &quot;India Shining&quot; advertisements as whether the governments, States or Centre are not permitted to use taxpayer&#x27;s money to promote any political gain. The BJP government has spent an approximate cost of Rs. 5 billion for the advertisements campaign during 2004 Parliament elections.

The India Shining slogan drew criticism from various columnists and political critics of the ruling National Democratic Alliance government for glossing over a variety of social problems, including poverty and social inequality.

The slogan was then used as a central theme in the BJP&#x27;s campaign for the 2004 national elections, a move criticised by the BJP&#x27;s political opponents, who felt that public money was being used for partisan purposes. In response, the Indian Election Commission banned the slogan&#x27;s broadcast until after the elections, although BJP politicians continued to use the slogan in other contexts.

<text>Chitra Singh (; formerly known as Chitra Dutta) is an Indian ghazal singer. She, alongside her second husband, Jagjit Singh, popularized the ghazal genre. Respectfully known as the &quot;king and queen of the Ghazal world,&quot; the husband and wife duo created some of the most successful Indian music of the 1970s and &#x27;80s.

==Personal life==
Chitra was born as Chitra Shome into a Bengali Hindu family. After completing her education, she was married to Debo Prasad Dutta, an executive in a leading advertising agency. The wedding was held in the mid-1950s, and the couple had a daughter, Monica, in 1959.

While still married to Debo Prasad, Chitra met Jagjit Singh, at that time a struggling singer. Jagjit Singh was from a Punjabi Sikh Namdhari family and hailed from Sriganganagar in distant Rajasthan. They first met at a recording studio in 1967, by which time the marriage of the Duttas was already under strain for unknown reasons. Chitra found solace in Jagjit and says she was much taken by his &quot;caring&quot; personality. In 1968, Chitra left Prasad, taking their 9-year-old daughter with her. In 1969, she divorced her husband, secured custody of Monica, and married Jagjit Singh.

They welcomed their son Vivek Singh on August 20,1970. In mid seventies, Chitra Singh and Jagjit Singh became famous for their ghazals and came to be known as the &quot;King and Queen of Ghazals&quot;. Vivek died in a road accident on July 27, 1990. Chitra has never sung in public, or recorded any song, since the day her son died.

Monica first fell in love with Jehangir Chowdhary, an award-winning cinematographer. They were married in 1988 and became the parents of two sons. In 2005, Monica divorced Chowdhary and married British national Mark Houghton Roger Atkins, the managing director of a firm based in Vikhroli, Mumbai. In 2007, Monica filed a case of harassment against Atkins. In 2008, a magistrate issued a non-bailable warrant against him, but he had already fled the country. In 2009, Monica, aged 50, died by suicide. She was survived by her two sons, Armaan (17) and Umair (12). Two years after this incident, Jagjit Singh died of a brain haemorrhage in 2011. Chitra now lives with her two grandsons.
