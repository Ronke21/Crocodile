<text>A full authority digital engine (or electronics) control (FADEC) is a system consisting of a digital computer, called an &quot;electronic engine controller&quot; (EEC) or &quot;engine control unit&quot; (ECU), and its related accessories that control all aspects of aircraft engine performance. FADECs have been produced for both piston engines and jet engines. 

==History==
The goal of any engine control system is to allow the engine to perform at maximum efficiency for a given condition. Originally, engine control systems consisted of simple mechanical linkages connected physically to the engine. By moving these levers the pilot or the flight engineer could control fuel flow, power output, and many other engine parameters. The mechanical/hydraulic engine control unit for Germany&#x27;s BMW 801 piston aviation radial engine of World War II was just one notable example of this in its later stages of development. This mechanical engine control was progressively replaced first by analogue electronic engine control and, later, digital engine control.

Analogue electronic control varies an electrical signal to communicate the desired engine settings. The system was an evident improvement over mechanical control but had its drawbacks, including common electronic noise interference and reliability issues. Full authority analogue control was used in the 1960s and introduced as a component of the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 engine of the supersonic transport aircraft Concorde. However, the more critical inlet control was digital on the production aircraft.

Digital electronic control followed. In 1968, Rolls-Royce and Elliott Automation, in conjunction with the National Gas Turbine Establishment, worked on a digital engine control system that completed several hundred hours of operation on a Rolls-Royce Olympus Mk 320. In the 1970s, NASA and Pratt and Whitney experimented with their first experimental FADEC, first flown on an F-111 fitted with a highly modified Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 left engine. The experiments led to Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 and Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000 being the first military and civil engines, respectively, fitted with FADEC, and later the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 as the first commercial &quot;dual FADEC&quot; engine. The first FADEC in service was the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine developed for the Harrier II by Dowty and Smiths Industries Controls.

==Function==
True full authority digital engine controls have no form of manual override nor manual controls available, placing full authority over all of the operating parameters of the engine in the hands of the computer. If a total FADEC failure occurs, the engine fails. If the engine is controlled digitally and electronically but allows for manual override, it is considered to be an EEC or ECU. An EEC, though a component of a FADEC, is not by itself FADEC. When standing alone, the EEC makes all of the decisions until the pilot wishes to intervene. The term FADEC is often misused for partial digital engine controls, such as those only electronically controlling fuel and ignition. A turbocharged piston engine would require digital control over all intake airflow to meet the definition of FADEC.
FADEC works by receiving multiple input variables of the current flight condition including air density, power lever request position, engine temperatures, engine pressures, and many other parameters. The inputs are received by the EEC and analyzed up to 70 times per second. Engine operating parameters such as fuel flow, stator vane position, air bleed valve position, and others are computed from this data and applied as appropriate. FADEC also controls engine starting and restarting. The FADEC&#x27;s basic purpose is to provide optimum engine efficiency for a given flight condition.

FADEC not only provides for efficient engine operation, it also allows the manufacturer to program engine limitations and receive engine health and maintenance reports. For example, to avoid exceeding a certain engine temperature, the FADEC can be programmed to automatically take the necessary measures without pilot intervention.

===Safety===

With the operation of the engines relying on automation, safety is a great concern. Redundancy is provided in the form of two or more separate but identical digital channels. Each channel may provide all engine functions without restriction. FADEC also monitors a variety of data coming from the engine subsystems and related aircraft systems, providing for fault tolerant engine control.

Engine control problems simultaneously causing loss of thrust on up to three engines have been cited as causal in the crash of an Airbus A400M aircraft at Seville Spain on 9 May 2015. Airbus Chief Strategy Officer Marwan Lahoud confirmed on 29 May that incorrectly installed engine control software caused the fatal crash. &quot;There are no structural defects [with the aircraft], but we have a serious quality problem in the final assembly.&quot;

===Applications===
A typical civilian transport aircraft flight may illustrate the function of a FADEC. The flight crew first enters flight data such as wind conditions, runway length, or cruise altitude, into the flight management system (FMS). The FMS uses this data to calculate power settings for different phases of the flight. At take-off, the flight crew advances the power lever to a predetermined setting, or opts for an auto-throttle take-off if available. The FADECs now apply the calculated take-off thrust setting by sending an electronic signal to the engines; there is no direct linkage to open fuel flow. This procedure can be repeated for any other phase of flight.

In flight, small changes in operation are constantly made to maintain efficiency. Maximum thrust is available for emergency situations if the power lever is advanced to full, but limitations can not be exceeded; the flight crew has no means of manually overriding the FADEC.

==Advantages==
* Automatic engine protection against out-of-tolerance operations
* Safer as the multiple channel FADEC computer provides redundancy in case of failure
* Care-free engine handling, with guaranteed thrust settings
* Ability to use single engine type for wide thrust requirements by just reprogramming the FADECs
* Provides semi-automatic engine starting
* Provides high-idle control appropriate for piston engine warmup
* Better systems integration with engine and aircraft systems
* Can provide engine long-term health monitoring and diagnostics
* Number of external and internal parameters used in the control processes increases by one order of magnitude
* Reduces the number of parameters to be monitored by flight crews
* Due to the high number of parameters monitored, the FADEC makes possible &quot;Fault Tolerant Systems&quot; (where a system can operate within required reliability and safety limitation with certain fault configurations)

==Disadvantages==
* Full authority digital engine controls have no form of manual override available, placing full authority over the operating parameters of the engine in the hands of the computer. (see note)
**If a total FADEC failure occurs, the engine fails. (see note)
**Upon total FADEC failure, pilots have no manual controls for engine restart, throttle, or other functions. (see note)
**Single point of failure risk can be mitigated with redundant FADECs (assuming that the failure is a random hardware failure and not the result of a design or manufacturing error, which may cause identical failures in all identical redundant components). (see note)
* High system complexity compared to hydromechanical, analogue or manual control systems
* High system development and validation effort due to the complexity
* Whereas in crisis (for example, imminent terrain contact), a non-FADEC engine can produce significantly more than its rated thrust, a FADEC engine will always operate within its limits. (see note)

Note: Most modern FADEC controlled aircraft engines (particularly those of the turboshaft variety) can be overridden and placed in manual mode, effectively countering most of the disadvantages on this list. Pilots should be very aware of where their manual override is located, because inadvertent engagement of the manual mode can lead to an overspeed of the engine.

==Requirements==
* Engineering processes must be used to design, manufacture, install and maintain the sensors which measure and report flight and engine parameters to the control system itself.
* Formal systems engineering processes are often used in the design, implementation and testing of the software used in these safety-critical control systems. This requirement led to the development and use of specialized software such as model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tools. The application development toolset SCADE (from Ansys) (not to be confused with the application category SCADA) is an example of an MBSE tool and has been used as part of the development of FADEC systems.

==Research==
NASA has analyzed a distributed FADEC architecture rather than the current centralized one, specifically for helicopters. Greater flexibility and lower life cycle costs are likely advantages of distribution.

<text>USS &quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; (DD-156), named for Joshua Frederick Cockey Talbott (1843–1918), Representative from Maryland Second District from 1879 to 1885, from 1893 to 1895 and again from 1903 to 1918, was a .

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; was laid down by the William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company at Philadelphia on 8 July 1918, launched on 14 December 1918 by Mrs. Robert L. Bates, niece of Representative Talbott and commissioned on 30 June 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island on 10 July for the Mediterranean Sea, where she acted as a station ship at various ports acting as US representation during reconstruction. Upon her return to the United States on 21 June 1920, the ship took part in Neutrality Patrol duty on the East Coast and engaged in fleet exercises before her decommissioning at Philadelphia on 18 January 1923.

&quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; recommissioned 1 May 1930 and immediately began shakedown training in Delaware Bay. For the ten years that followed, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea engaging in anti-submarine training; fleet operations; and carrying out the many far-ranging duties of the United States fleet. She also helped to train reserves and midshipmen.

With the outbreak of the war in Europe, and the United States&#x27; initial effort to protect its shipping while remaining neutral, &quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; was assigned patrol duties in the waters off the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal. Following the US entry into the war with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the ship took up convoy escort duties between New Orleans, Cuba, and the Panama Canal.

Following an in Boston in January 1944, &quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; sailed on 13 February with her first transatlantic convoy, and, after her safe return from Casablanca, took up escort duties with convoys from Iceland southward into the Caribbean. Later in the year, after arrival on 15 September, she was converted at New York and reclassified AG-81 on 25 September 1944. The ship arrived Port Everglades, Florida, 1 November to act as a target ship for torpedo bombers, continuing this training service until the war&#x27;s end.

&quot;J. Fred Talbott&quot; was decommissioned at Boston on 21 May 1946, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 June 1946 and sold for scrap to the Boston Metals Corporation of Baltimore, Maryland on 22 December 1946.

<doc id="528085" wikidata="Q4552029" url="?curid=528085" title="USS Schenck">
<text>USS &quot;Schenck&quot; (DD-159) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Rear Admiral James F. Schenck, USN (1807–1882).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Schenck&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 26 March 1918, launched on 23 April 1919, sponsored by Miss Mary Janet Earle and commissioned on 30 October 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;Schenck&quot; was attached to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and, after shakedown, operated between New York and Chesapeake Bay. Between July and September 1920, she patrolled off the east coast of Mexico; and, in early 1921, she participated in fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea. Her crew was reduced to 50% of her authorized complement at Charleston, South Carolina, on 7 November 1921; and she was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 9 June 1922.

&quot;Schenck&quot; was recommissioned on 1 May 1930, and trained reservists during the summer. In January 1931, she joined the fleet in the Caribbean for Fleet Problem XII and, the following year, also participated in Fleet Problem XIII off Hawaii. Due to the increased tension in the Far East resulting from Japanese military action in Manchuria and at Shanghai, China, she remained in the Pacific Ocean with the Scouting Fleet until June 1932. &quot;Schenck&quot; again returned to the Pacific in February 1933 for Fleet Problem XIV and remained there until April 1934, when she re-entered the Caribbean for more fleet exercises. Then, with intervening periods of and rotating reserve at Norfolk, Virginia &quot;Schenck&quot; trained naval reservists and Naval Academy midshipmen in cruises along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from May 1935 until the outbreak of war in Europe.

===World War II===
On 9 September 1939, &quot;Schenck&quot; commenced Neutrality Patrol duty off the east coast; and, after overhaul, moved to Key West for further patrols. During the summer of 1940, she made two midshipman cruises from Annapolis. She then carried out more patrols in the Caribbean, between 22 August and 8 December 1940, between 15 January and 18 March 1941, and between 27 June and 14 July 1941. Training and repairs filled intervals between her patrols.

On 15 September 1941, &quot;Schenck&quot; arrived at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, for duty escorting convoys carrying vital materiel to England. She left Argentia with her first convoy on 29 September; and when the United States entered World War II, the destroyer had escorted two convoys to a guarded rendezvous with British escorts off Iceland and escorted a ship back to Argentia. She remained on the convoy route between Argentia and Iceland until April 1943, fighting heavy weather and German submarines. During two long periods, 19 February to 9 May 1942 and 18 August 1942 to 23 March 1943, she was based in Iceland escorting convoys in and out of Icelandic ports. Twice her convoy was attacked; on 15 August 1942, and from 6 to 8 February 1943. The weather also took its toll, frequently causing minor structural damage to the old ship; and, on 13 March 1943, a gale caused her to drag anchor and collide with SS &quot;Exterminator&quot; in an Icelandic port. &quot;Schenck&quot; was then sent to Boston for repairs.

===North Atlantic convoys escorted===
===Mid-Atlantic===
Reassigned to more southerly routes, &quot;Schenck&quot; resumed convoy escort duties on 28 April 1943, and, during the summer, escorted convoys between east coast ports, the Caribbean, and North Africa. She returned to Chesapeake Bay with a convoy on 26 October 1943, and, after overhaul and training, joined a hunter-killer group built around the escort carrier . The group conducted patrols against enemy submarines near the Azores between 24 November 1943 and 2 January 1944. The high point of &quot;Schenck&quot;″ war service came on 24 December 1943, when the group located a concentration of U-boats. After stalking radar and sound contacts for most of the night and making six attacks, &quot;Schenck&quot; heard an underwater explosion and saw an oil slick which marked the end of . Almost immediately, another submarine sank &quot;Schenck&quot;″s squadronmate, . &quot;Schenck&quot; continued her ASW operations and was later commended by the task group commander for her role in preventing a concentrated wolf pack attack on &quot;Card&quot;; for her continued aggressive action after the sinking of &quot;Leary&quot;, despite having only fourteen depth charges left; and for her skillful rescue of &quot;Leary&quot;″s survivors.

In February and March 1944, &quot;Schenck&quot; made one more round-trip convoy voyage from the east coast to Casablanca, and, between 17 April and 10 June, she escorted on troop-carrying voyages along the east coast. Between 10 July and 29 August, she provided training services for submarines at Bermuda and then entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard where she was stripped of her armament. Subsequently, she was assigned for duty under Commander, Air Force, Atlantic Fleet, as a torpedo target ship for aircraft. Reclassified AG-82 effective 25 September 1944, she provided target services for student pilots off Quonset Point, Rhode Island, until the end of the war. This service is not without its dangers. The ship was twice holed by exercise torpedoes which failed to run at set depth and once struck by a low-flying aircraft.

&quot;Schenck&quot; was decommissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 17 May 1946, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 June 1946 and sold for scrap to the Boston Metals Company at Baltimore in Maryland on 25 November 1946.

<doc id="528086" wikidata="Q6462807" url="?curid=528086" title="USS Herbert">
<text>USS &quot;Herbert&quot; (DD-160) was a &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyer. She was named for Hilary A. Herbert (1834–1919), Secretary of the Navy from 1893 to 1897.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Herbert&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 9 April 1918, launched on 8 May 1919 by Mrs. Benjamin Micou, daughter of the late Hilary A. Herbert and commissioned on 21 November 1919.

==Service history==
After shakedown in South Atlantic waters, &quot;Herbert&quot; trained in the Caribbean until 1 May 1920, returning there 20 July with the Atlantic Fleet destroyer squadron. &quot;Herbert&quot; participated in torpedo practices, antiaircraft drills, and short range battle practice along the east coast. She decommissioned at Philadelphia 27 June 1922.

&quot;Herbert&quot; recommissioned 1 May 1930 and joined the Scouting Fleet at Newport, Rhode Island. For the next 4 years she operated in both East and West Coast waters, playing important roles in annual fleet problems and battle practice. From 16 January 1935 until August 1939, &quot;Herbert&quot; served as a training ship for Naval Reserves and midshipmen. As war swept across Europe, she sailed to Portugal via the Azores 2 October 1939 and remained there until July 1940.

Returning to the States, the destroyer underwent overhaul and 10 October reported to New London for sound school training. &quot;Herbert&quot;″s training kept pace with the steadily intensifying war in Europe as she spent most of 1941 in battle practice, torpedo drills, and antisubmarine work.

===World War II===
With America&#x27;s entry into the war, &quot;Herbert&quot; operated as a convoy escort along the American coast from Key West north to Halifax and Iceland. Guiding virtually defenseless merchant ships through coastal and Caribbean waters patrolled by U-boats, &quot;Herbert&quot; carried out frequent depth charge attacks on marauding submarines. From April through June 1943 she visited Gibraltar and North Africa, as the build-up for the invasion of Sicily intensified. A hunter-killer patrol followed. After a second patrol, &quot;Herbert&quot; escorted a convoy from Bermuda to Casablanca, returning to Charleston 22 November 1943 for conversion to a high-speed transport.

===Convoys escorted===
===Auxiliary service===
&quot;Herbert&quot; now APD-22 sailed for the Pacific, reaching San Diego for amphibious training and continuing on to Cape Sudest, New Guinea, via Pearl Harbor 23 March 1944. She disembarked troops for the initial invasion at Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, 22 April and then spent a month on convoy escort duty before landing troops for the invasion of Biak Island 27 May. Landings at Warsai in the Cape Sansapor area 30 July followed further patrol and escort duty, and 15 September found &quot;Herbert&quot; off Morotai. Troops landed under naval cover to secure the airfield, which was within easy striking distance of the Philippines, next major step in the island-hopping war across the Pacific. On 17 October, 2 days before the initial landings at Leyte Gulf, &quot;Herbert&quot; landed Rangers on Homonhon Island which controlled the entrance to the Gulf. The destroyer remained in the Philippines, under almost constant Japanese air attack, throughout the rest of 1944; and, in January 1945, landed support troops at Lingayen Gulf.

From the Philippines, &quot;Herbert&quot; moved north for escort duty to Iwo Jima, returning to Leyte 18 March 1945 to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa, the largest amphibious operation of the Pacific war. Arriving Okinawa 31 March, the day before the initial landings, &quot;Herbert&quot; took up patrol and escort duties. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; attacks wounded ships all around her, but &quot;Herbert&quot; remained untouched. After two runs escorting convoys from back staging areas up to Okinawa, the destroyer headed home, reaching San Diego 19 June. &quot;Herbert&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 25 September 1945, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 October 1945 and sold for scrap to the Boston Metal Company of Baltimore in Maryland on 23 May 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Herbert&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Jaan Kross (19 February 1920 – 27 December 2007) was an Estonian writer. He won the 1995 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

==Early life==
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, son of a skilled metal worker, Jaan Kross studied at Jakob Westholm Gymnasium, and attended the University of Tartu (1938–1945) and graduated from its School of Law. He taught there as a lecturer until 1946, and again as professor of &quot;Artes Liberales&quot; in 1998.

In 1940, when Kross was 20, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied the three Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; imprisoned and executed most of their governments. In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded and took over the country.

Kross was first arrested by the Germans for six months in 1944 during the German occupation of Estonia (1941–1944), suspected of what was termed &quot;nationalism&quot;; that is, promoting Estonian independence. Then, on 5 January 1946, when Estonia had been reconquered by the Soviet Union, he was arrested by the Soviet occupation authorities, who kept him a short while in the cellar of the local NKVD headquarters, then kept him in prison in Tallinn, finally in October 1947, deporting him to a Gulag camp in Vorkuta, Russia. He spent a total of eight years in this part of North Russia, six working in the mines at the Minlag labour camp in Inta, then doing easier jobs, plus two years still living as a deportee, but not in a labour camp. Upon his return to Estonia in 1954 he became a professional writer, not least because his law studies during Estonian independence were now of no value whatsoever, as Soviet law held sway.

At first, Kross wrote poetry, alluding to a number of contemporary phenomena under the guise of writing about historical figures. But he soon moved to writing prose, a genre that was to become his principal one.
==Career as a writer==

===Recognition and translation===
Kross was by far the most translated and nationally and internationally best-known Estonian writer. He received the honorary title of People&#x27;s Writer of the Estonian SSR (1985) and the State Prize of the Estonian SSR (1977). He also held several honorary doctorates and international decorations, including the highest Estonian order and one of the highest German orders. In 1999 he was awarded the Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature.

In 1990 Kross won the Amnesty International Golden Flame Prize. He won the 1995 International Nonino Prize in Italy. He was reportedly nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature during the early 1990s. 

Because of Kross&#x27; status and visibility as a leading Estonian author, his works have been translated into many languages, but mostly into Finnish, Swedish, Russian, German, and Latvian. This is on account of geographical proximity but also a common history (for example, Estonia was a Swedish colony in the 17th century and German was the language of the upper échelons of Estonian society for hundreds of years). As can be seen from the list below by the year 2015 five books of Kross&#x27; works have been published in English translation with publishing houses in the United States and UK. But a number of shorter novels, novellas, and short stories were published during Soviet rule (i.e. 1944–1991) in English translation and published in the Soviet Union.

Translations have mostly been from the Estonian original. Sometimes translations were however done, during Soviet times by first being translated into Russian and then from Russian into English, not infrequently by native speakers of Russian or Estonian. Nowadays, Kross&#x27; works are translated into English either directly from the Estonian, or via the Finnish version. A reasonably complete list of translations of works by Jaan Kross into languages other than English can be found on the ELIC website.
Kross knew German from quite an early age because friends of the family spoke it as their native language, and Kross&#x27; mother had a good command of it. His Russian, however, was mainly learned while working as a slave labourer in the gulag. He also had some knowledge of Swedish and translated a crime novel by Christian Steen (a pseudonym of the exile Estonian novelist Karl Ristikivi) from Swedish. He also translated works by Pierre-Jean de Béranger, Honoré de Balzac, and Paul Éluard from French, Bertolt Brecht and Rolf Hochhuth from German, Ivan Goncharov and David Samoilov from Russian, and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Othello&quot; from English.

===Content and style===
Kross&#x27; novels and short stories are almost universally historical; indeed, he is often credited with a significant rejuvenation of the genre of the historical novel. Most of his works take place in Estonia and deal, usually, with the relationship of Estonians and Baltic Germans and Russians. Very often, Kross&#x27; description of the historical struggle of the Estonians against the Baltic Germans is a metaphor for the contemporary struggle against the Soviet occupation. However, Kross&#x27; acclaim internationally (and nationally even after the regaining of Estonian independence) shows that his novels also deal with topics beyond such concerns; rather, they deal with questions of mixed identities, loyalty, and belonging.

Generally, &quot;The Czar&#x27;s Madman&quot; has been considered Kross&#x27; best novel; it is also the most translated one. Also well-translated is &quot;Professor Martens&#x27; Departure&quot;, which because of its subject matter (academics, expertise, and national loyalty) is very popular in academia and an important &quot;professorial novel&quot;. The later novel &quot;Excavations&quot;, set in the mid-1950s, deals with the &quot;thaw&quot; period after Stalin&#x27;s death as well as with the Danish conquest of Estonia in the Middle Ages, and today considered by several critics as his finest, has not been translated into English yet; it is however available in German.

Within the framework of the historical novel, Kross&#x27; novels can be divided up into two types: truly historical ones, and more contemporary narratives with an element of autobiography. In the list below, the historical ones, often set in previous centuries, include the &quot;Between Three Plagues&quot; tetralogy, set in the 16th century, &quot;A Rakvere Novel / Romance&quot; set in the 18th (the title is ambiguous), &quot;The Czar&#x27;s Madman&quot; set in the 19th century, &quot;Professor Martens&#x27; Departure&quot; set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and &quot;Elusiveness / Evasion&quot; set around 1918. The semi-autobiographical novels include Kross&#x27; novel about the ultimate fates of his schoolmates, i.e. &quot;The Wikman Boys&quot; (Wikman being based on his alma mater the Westholm Grammar School – both names are of Swedish origin) a similar sort of novel about his university chums, &quot;Mesmer&#x27;s Circle / Ring&quot;; the novel &quot;Excavations&quot; which describes Kross&#x27; alter ego Peeter Mirk and his adventures with archaeology, conformism, revolt, compromise and skulduggery after he has returned from the Siberian labour camps and internal exile out there. And also the novel that has appeared in English translation is titled &quot;Treading Air&quot;, and most of his short stories belong to this subgenre.

A stylistic leitmotif in Kross&#x27; novels is the use of the internal (or inner) monologue, usually when the protagonist is trying to think his way out of a thorny problem. The reader will note that every protagonist or narrator, from Timotheus von Bock in &quot;The Czar&#x27;s Madman&quot; to Kross&#x27; two alter egos, Jaak Sirkel and Peeter Mirk in the semi-autobiographical novels, indulges in this. And especially Bernhard Schmidt, the luckless telescope inventor, in the novel that appeared in English as &quot;Sailing Against the Wind&quot; (2012).

Another common feature of Kross&#x27;s novels is a comparison, sometimes overt but usually covert, between various historical epochs and the present day, which for much of Kross&#x27; writing life consisted of Soviet reality, including censorship, an inability to travel freely abroad, a dearth of consumer goods, the ever-watchful eye of the KGB and informers, etc. Kross was always very skilful at always remaining just within the bounds of what the Soviet authorities could accept. Kross also enjoyed playing with the identities of people who have the same, or nearly the same, name. This occurs in &quot;Professor Martens&#x27; Departure&quot; where two different Martens figures are discussed, legal experts who lived several decades apart, and in &quot;Sailing Against the Wind&quot; where in one dream sequence the protagonist Bernhard Schmidt meets a number of others named Schmidt.

When Kross was already in his late 70s he gave a series of lectures at Tartu University explaining certain aspects of his novels, not least the roman à clef dimension, given the fact that quite a few of his characters are based on real-life people, both in the truly historical novels and the semi-autobiographical ones. These lectures are collected in a book entitled &quot;Omaeluloolisus ja alltekst&quot; (Autobiographism and Subtext) which appeared in 2003.

During the last twenty years of his life, Jaan Kross occupied some of his time with writing his memoirs (entitled &quot;Kallid kaasteelised&quot;, i.e. &quot;Dear Co-Travellers&quot; – this translation of the title avoids the unfortunate connotation of the expression &quot;fellow-travellers&quot;). These two volumes ended up with a total of 1,200 pages, including quite a few photographs from his life. His life started quietly enough, but after describing quite innocuous things such as the summer house during his childhood and his schooldays, Kross moves on to the first Soviet occupation of Estonia, his successful attempt to avoid being drafted for the Waffen-SS during the Nazi German occupation, and a long section covering his experiences of prison and the labour camps. The last part describes his return from the camps and his attempts at authorship. The second volume continues from when he moved into the flat in central Tallinn where he lived for the rest of his life, plus his growing success as a writer. There is also a section covering his one-year term as a Member of Parliament after renewed independence, and his trips abroad with his wife.

==Synopses==

===Short synopses of works available in English translation===
Six books by Jaan Kross have been published in English translation, five novels and one collection of stories: The English translations appeared in the following order: &quot;The Czar&#x27;s Madman&quot; 1992; &quot;Professor Martens&#x27; Departure&quot; 1994; &quot;The Conspiracy and Other Stories&quot; 1995; &quot;Treading Air&quot; 2003; &quot;Sailing Against the Wind&quot; 2012, Between Three Plagues, 2016-2018. Descriptions of the above books can also be found on various websites and online bookshops. The protagonists of several of the books listed here are based on real-life figures.

The Czar&#x27;s Madman (Estonian: &quot;Keisri hull&quot;, 1978; English: 1994; translator: Anselm Hollo).
This tragic novel is based on the life of a Baltic-German nobleman, Timotheus von Bock (1787–1836), who was an adjutant to the relatively liberal Czar of Russia, Alexander I. Von Bock wishes to interest the Czar in the idea of liberating the serfs, i.e. the peasant classes, people who were bought and sold almost like slaves by rich landowners. But this is too much for the Czar and in 1818 von Bock is arrested and kept, at the Czar&#x27;s pleasure, in a prison in Schlüsselburg. Von Bock is released when the next Czar ascends the throne, but by that time he is having mental problems during his last years under house arrest. This is regarded as Kross&#x27;s most accomplished novel, along with the &quot;Between Three Plagues&quot; tetralogy (see below).

Professor Martens&#x27; Departure (Estonian: &quot;Professor Martensi ärasõit&quot;, 1984; English: 1994; translator: Anselm Hollo).
In early June 1909, the ethnic Estonian professor, Friedrich Fromhold Martens (1845–1909) gets on the train in Pärnu heading for the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Empire in the capital, Saint Petersburg. During the journey, he thinks back over the events and episodes of his life. Should he have made a career working for the Russian administration as a compiler of treaties at the expense of his Estonian identity? He also muses on his namesake, a man who worked on a similar project in earlier decades. A novel that examines the compromises involved when making a career in an empire when coming from a humble background.

Sailing Against the Wind (Estonian: &quot;Vastutuulelaev&quot;, 1987; English: 2012; translator: Eric Dickens).
This novel is about the ethnic Estonian Bernhard Schmidt (1879–1935) from the island of Naissaar who loses his right hand in a firework accident during his teenage years. He nevertheless uses his remaining hand to work wonders when polishing high-quality lenses and mirrors for astronomical telescopes. Later on, when living in what had become Nazi Germany, he himself invents large stellar telescopes that are still to be found at, for instance, the Mount Palomar Observatory in California and on the island of Mallorca. Schmidt has to wrestle with his conscience when living in Germany as the country is re-arming and telescopes could be put to military use. But because Germany was the leading technical nation at the time, he feels reasonably comfortable there, first in the run-down small town of Mittweida, then at the main Bergedorf Observatory just outside Hamburg. But the rise of the Nazis is literally driving him mad.

The Conspiracy and Other Stories (Estonian: &quot;Silmade avamise päev&quot;, 1988 – most of the stories there; English: 1995; translator: Eric Dickens).
This collection contains six semi-autobiographical stories mostly dealing with Jaan Kross&#x27; life during the Nazi-German and Soviet-Russian occupations of Estonia, and his own imprisonment during those two epochs. The stories, some of which have appeared elsewhere in this translation, are. &quot;The Wound&quot;, &quot;Lead Piping&quot;, &quot;The Stahl Grammar&quot;, &quot;The Conspiracy&quot;, &quot;The Ashtray&quot;, and &quot;The Day Eyes Were Opened&quot;. In all of them, there is a tragi-comic aspect.

Treading Air (Estonian: &quot;Paigallend&quot;, 1998; English: 2003; translator: Eric Dickens).
The protagonist of this novel is Ullo Paerand, a restless young man of many talents. He attends a prestigious private school, but when his speculator father abandons him and his mother the money runs out. He then helps his mother run a laundry to make ends meet. He works his way up, ultimately becoming a messenger boy for the Estonian Prime Minister&#x27;s office. He is even offered a chance to escape abroad by going to study at the Vatican, but stays in Estonia. This semi-autobiographical novel is set against the background of a very stormy epoch in the history of Estonia, from when the Soviets occupy the country in 1940, the German occupation the next year, the notorious bombing of central Tallinn by the Soviet airforce on 9 March 1944, and a further thirty years of life in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Between Three Plagues (&quot;Kolme katku vahel&quot;, four volumes 1970–1980; English: three volumes 2016–2018; translator: Merike Lepasaar Beecher)
This is Kross&#x27; first major work and his largest in volume. The idea started out as a film script, which was shelved, then became a TV serial, and finally the four-volume suite of novels which is one of Kross&#x27; most famous works. It is set in the 16th century, especially the middle, before and during the Livonian War which lasted, on and off, from the 1550s to the early 1580s. Livonia included parts of what are now Estonia and Latvia, and was by the 1550s split up into several parts ruled by Denmark, Sweden, Russia and Poland-Lithuania. The protagonist is, as is often the case with Kross, a real-life figure called Balthasar Russow (c 1536–1600), who wrote the Livonian Chronicle. The chronicle describes the political horse-trading between the various countries and churches of the day. The Estonians, mostly of peasant stock in those days, always ended up as piggies in the middle. There were also three outbreaks of the bubonic plague to contend with. Russow was the humble son of a peasant, but became a German-speaking clergyman, which was a big step up in society. The fact that he could read, let alone write a chronicle, was unusual. The tetralogy starts with a famous scene where the then-ten-year-old Balthasar watches some tightrope walkers in Tallinn, a metaphor for his own diplomatic tightrope walking later in life. He appears as something of a rough diamond throughout the books. The entire tetralogy has been translated into Dutch, Finnish, German, Latvian, Russian, and English.

===Short synopses of works not yet available in English===

The majority of Kross&#x27;s novels remain untranslated into English. These are as follows:

Under Clio&#x27;s Gaze (&quot;Klio silma all&quot;; 1972)
This slim volume contains four novellas. The first deals with Michael Sittow, a painter who has been working at the court of Spain but now wants to join the painters&#x27; guild in Tallinn which is as good as a closed shop (&quot;Four Monologues on the Subject of Saint George&quot;). The second story tells of an ethnic Estonian Michelson who will now be knighted by the Czar as he has been instrumental in putting down a rebellion in Russia; this is the story of his pangs of conscience, but also how he brings his peasant parents to the ceremony to show his origins (&quot;Michelson&#x27;s Matriculation&quot;) The third story is set in around 1824, and about the collator of Estonian folk literature Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald who, after passing his exams, does not want to become a theologian but wants to study military medicine in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Russian Empire; meanwhile, he meets a peasant who can tell him about the Estonian epic hero Kalev, here of the epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; (&quot;Two Lost Sheets of Paper&quot;). The final story is set in the 1860s, when a national consciousness was awakening in Estonia and the newspaper editor Johann Voldemar Jannsen starts an Estonian-language newspaper with his daughter Lydia Koidula and founds the Estonian Song Festival (&quot;A While in a Swivel Chair&quot;).

The Third Range of Hills (&quot;Kolmandad mäed&quot;; 1974)
This short novel tells the story of the ethnic Estonian painter Johann Köler (1826–1899) who had become a famous portrait painter at the Russian court in Saint Petersburg. He is now, in 1879, painting a fresco for a church in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. As a model for his Christ, he picks out an Estonian peasant from the island of Hiiumaa. Later it transpires that the man he used as a model was a sadistic criminal, and this is held against Köler by his Baltic-German overlords.

A Rakvere Novel (&quot;Rakvere romaan&quot;; 1982)
The novel is set in the year 1764. The young Berend Falck is taken on by the Baroness Gertrude von Tisenhausen. Falck is an ethnic Estonian, von Tisenhausen a Baltic-German. Rakvere (Wesenberg, in German) is an Estonian provincial town and in those days the baroness dominated. Falck soon gets involved in the struggle between the townspeople and the baroness. And as he has been employed by her, he is initially obliged to take her side. But as she begins to confiscate land, he grows disillusioned with her. The townspeople, for their part, attempt to reclaim the rights that they had had earlier under Swedish colonial rule, decades before. Sweden lost Estonia to Russia around 1710, so in the epoch in which this novel is set, Rakvere and indeed Estonia are part of the Russian Empire, despite the fact that this local dispute is between the German-speaking baronial classes and Estonian-speaking peasants. A panoramic novel of divided loyalties and corruption.

The Wikman Boys (&quot;Wikmani poisid&quot;; 1988)
Jaan Kross&#x27; alter ego Jaak Sirkel will soon matriculate from school in the mid-1930s. Young people eagerly go to the cinema in their free time; at school, they have the usual sprinkling of eccentric teachers. Europe is gradually moving towards war, and this overshadows the lives of the young people. After the war has reached Estonia, some of Sirkel&#x27;s schoolmates end up in the Soviet Army, and others fighting in the Nazi German military – the tragedy of a small country fought over by two superpowers. In the devastating Battle of Velikiye Luki, not far from the Russian-Estonian border, Estonians fight on both sides.

Excavations (&quot;Väljakaevamised&quot;; 1990)
This novel first appeared in Finnish as the political situation in Estonia was very unclear owing to the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union. It tells the story of Peeter Mirk (another of Kross&#x27; alter egos) who has just returned from eight years of labour camp and internal exile in Siberia and is looking for work, in order to avoid being sent back, labelled as a &quot;parasite to Soviet society&quot;. And he needs the money to live on. It is now 1954, Stalin is dead, and there is a slight political thaw. He finds a job on an archaeological dig near the main bastion in central Tallinn. There he finds a manuscript written in the 13th century by a leprous clergyman, a document which could overturn some of the assumptions about the history of Estonia that the Soviet occupier has. The novel also gives portraits of several luckless individuals who have been caught up in the paradoxes of German and Russian occupations.

Elusiveness (&quot;Tabamatus&quot;; 1993)
In 1941, a young Estonian law student is a fugitive from the occupying German Nazis, as he is suspected of being a resistance fighter. He is accused of writing certain things during the one-year Soviet occupation the previous year. But what the German occupiers dislike especially is that this young law student is writing a work about the Estonian politician and freedom fighter Jüri Vilms (1889–1918) who was obliged to flee from the Germans back in 1918 (during another period of Estonia&#x27;s tangled history) and was shot by firing squad when he had just reached Helsinki, around the time that Estonia became independent of Russia.

Mesmer&#x27;s Circle (&quot;Mesmeri ring&quot;; 1995)
Another novel involving Kross&#x27; alter ego, Jaak Sirkel, who is by now a first-year student at Tartu University. One of his fellow students Indrek Tarna has been sent to Siberia by the Reds, when the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940. Indrek&#x27;s father performs a strange ritual with several people standing around the dining table and holding hands – as Franz Mesmer did with his patients. This ritual is meant to give his boy strength by way of prayer. Others react in a more conventional way to the tensions of 1939. This is also where the reader first meets the fellow student who will become the protagonist in Kross&#x27; novel &quot;Treading Air&quot;. The novel is partly a love story, where Sirkel, a friend of Tarna&#x27;s is in love with his girlfriend Riina. And Tarna is in Siberia... Conflicting loyalties. When the Germans invade Estonia Tarna can return to Estonia. The Riina problem gets more tangled.

Tahtamaa (idem; 2001)
Tahtamaa is a plot of land by the sea. This novel is described by Rutt Hinrikus of the Estonian Literary Museum in a short review article on the internet. It is a novel about the differences in mentality between the Estonians who lived in the Soviet Union, and those that escaped abroad, and their descendants. It is also a novel about greed and covetousness, ownership, and is even a love story between older people. This is Kross&#x27; last novel and is set in the 1990s, after Estonia regained its independence.

==Death==

Jaan Kross died in Tallinn, at the age of 87, on 27 December 2007. He was survived by his wife, children&#x27;s author and poet Ellen Niit, and four children. The President of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, praised Kross &quot;as a preserver of the Estonian language and culture.&quot;

Kross is buried at Rahumäe cemetery in Tallinn.

<text>USS &quot;Chafee&quot; (DDG-90) is the 40th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in United States Navy. She is named for Senator John Lester Hubbard Chafee (1922–1999), a Marine veteran of Guadalcanal who also served as the Secretary of the Navy. &quot;Chafee&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine on 12 April 2001, launched on 2 November 2002 and commissioned on 18 October 2003 in Newport, Rhode Island, the home state of the ship&#x27;s namesake.

==Service history==
&quot;Chafee&quot; left her homeport of Pearl Harbor 20 May 2005 for her maiden deployment with the Carrier Strike Group (CSG). She returned to her homeport after a regularly scheduled deployment in support of the Global War on Terrorism.

&quot;Chafee&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 9 April 2007, as part of the San Diego–based &quot;Nimitz&quot; CSG and deployed to the U.S 5th Fleet (C5F) area of operations. On 1 June 2007, &quot;Chafee&quot; fired her main gun at Al-Qaeda suspects in the Puntland region of Somalia. The men were wanted for the 1998 United States embassy bombings. &quot;Chafee&quot; returned home to Pearl Harbor on 22 September 2007, marking the end a successful 167-day Western Pacific and Middle East deployment.

&quot;Chafee&quot; is an active unit of the Pacific Fleet and operates out of Naval Station San Diego, California; currently, &quot;Chafee&quot; is assigned to the carrier group.

On 10 December 2020, It was reported that &quot;Chafee&quot; tested the Tomahawk Block V missile for the first time.

&quot;Chafee&quot; participated in RIMPAC 2022.

==Awards==
*COMNAVSURFPAC Intelligence Excellence Award (2021)
* Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (May–Jun 2007, Apr 2012 – Dec 2013)
* Battle &quot;E&quot; (2007, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015)
* Spokane Trophy Award (2006)
* Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Energy Conservation Award (Afloat category) (2015)
* Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Ship-Helicopter Safety Award – (2015)

==In popular culture==
The construction of USS &quot;Chafee&quot; and , from initial steel cutting to sea trials, was documented in the Discovery Channel television special &quot;Destroyer: Forged in Steel&quot;. The destroyers were not referenced by name, but their numbers were visible on their bows.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
A white anchor on a background of blue surrounded by a thin wavy white border, and then surrounded by a red border that is marked with thirteen gold stars.

The anchor—at the center of the shield—is borrowed from the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s Flag, in reference to John Chafee&#x27;s time in that position. The thirteen stars is a reference to Rhode Island, Chafee&#x27;s home state. The wavy border symbolizes the sea and Navy. The color white represents integrity. Blue and gold are the traditional colors of the navy, and the colors denote the sea the excellence, respectively. While the color red denotes courage.

=== Crest ===
In gold, an eagle is holding a red serpent with its beak. The eagle is clutching arrows with its talons, and it is perched on a representation of the Senate Chamber of the Capitol Building. Behind the eagle, a Naval Officer&#x27;s sword and a Marine Corps mameluke in saltire points upwards. A laurel wreath serves as a back ground and encircles the eagle. The base of the crest is a blue and white decorative rope.

The two swords signify Chafee&#x27;s military service in two wars, specifically the mameluke symbolizes his time in the Marine Corps. The laurel wreath is a symbol Chafee&#x27;s honor and achievement during his time as a marine, Secretary of the Navy, senator and governor. The eagle is a reference to the senator&#x27;s time as the Secretary of the Navy. As mentioned before, the color gold and red represents excellence and courage, respectively.

=== Motto ===
Commanding the Seas.

=== Seal ===
The coat of arms is the shield that topped with the crest. The coat of arms is then placed on a white background, and is surrounded by a dark blue oval that is bordered by a gold chain. The ship&#x27;s name is inscribed at the top of the oval, and the hull number is inscribed at the bottom.

<doc id="528092" wikidata="Q450770" url="?curid=528092" title="Fulda Gap">
<text>The Fulda Gap (), an area between the Hesse-Thuringian border, the former Inner German border, and Frankfurt am Main, contains two corridors of lowlands through which tanks might have driven in a surprise attack by the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies to gain crossings of the Rhine River. Named for the town of Fulda, the Fulda Gap became seen as strategically important during the Cold War of 1947–1991. The Fulda Gap roughly corresponds to the route along which Napoleon chose to withdraw his armies after defeat (16–19 October 1813) at the Battle of Leipzig. Napoleon succeeded in defeating a Bavarian-Austrian army under Wrede in the Battle of Hanau (30–31 October 1813) not far from Frankfurt. From there he escaped back to France.

From 1815, the area appeared of minimal strategic importance, as it lay deep within the borders of the German Confederation and from 1871 of the German Empire. German military planning presumed any war would be effectively lost, long before an enemy reached that far into the homeland. The route became important again at the end of World War II when the U.S. XII Corps used it in their advance eastward in late March and early April 1945. The U.S. advance had little consequence for Germany&#x27;s strategic position, which was hopeless by that point, but it allowed the Americans to occupy vast swaths of territory which the Yalta Conference of February 1945 had assigned to the Soviet occupation zone. This did much to compel the Soviets to honor the Yalta Conference agreement, meaning that Western Allies got access to Berlin. In exchange, the U.S. Army withdrew in July 1945 from Thuringia and Saxony, to the line agreed upon in Yalta.

During the Cold War, the Fulda Gap offered one of the two obvious routes for a hypothetical Soviet tank attack on West Germany from Eastern Europe, especially from East Germany. The other route crossed the North German Plain. A third, less likely, route involved travelling up through the Danube River valley through neutral Austria. The concept of a major tank battle along the Fulda Gap became a predominant element of NATO war planning during the Cold War. With such an eventuality in mind, weapons were evolved such as nuclear tube and missile artillery, the nuclear recoilless gun/tactical launcher Davy Crockett, Special Atomic Demolition Munitions, the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, and A-10 ground attack aircraft.

==Strategic location during the Cold War==
The northern route through the Gap passes south of the Knüllgebirge and continues around the northern flank of the Vogelsberg Mountains. The narrower southern route passes through the Fliede and Kinzig Valleys, with the Vogelsberg to the north and the Rhön mountains and Spessart mountains to the south. More importantly, on emerging from the western exit of the Gap, encounters flat terrain from there to the river Rhine, which would have counted in favour of Soviet attempts to reach and cross the Rhine before NATO could prevent this. The intervening Main River would have been less of an obstacle.

The Fulda Gap route was less suitable for mechanized troop movement than the North German Plain, but offered an avenue of advance direct to Frankfurt am Main. Furthermore the capital of the Federal Republic in Bonn, was situated only 200 km to the west. A rapidly advancing Soviet or Warsaw Pact attack through the Fulda Gap, along the lines of Seven Days to the River Rhine, could have also potentially cut the territory of West Germany in two parts, making the long-term existence of a West German state untenable.

==Strategic responses to the geographic feature==
Strategists on both sides of the Iron Curtain understood the Fulda Gap&#x27;s importance, and accordingly allocated forces to defend and attack it. The defense of the Fulda Gap was a mission of the U.S. V Corps. The actual Inner German border in the Fulda Gap was guarded by reconnaissance forces, the identification and structure of which evolved over the years of the Cold War.

From June 1945 until July 1946, reconnaissance and security along the border between the U.S. and Soviet zones of occupation in Germany in the area north and south of Fulda was the mission of elements of the U.S. 3rd and 1st Infantry Divisions. By July 1946, the 1st, 3rd, and 14th Constabulary Regiments, arranged from north to south, had assumed responsibility for inter-zonal border security, in an area that later became famous as the Cold War Fulda Gap. The U.S. Constabulary as a headquarters was subsequently drawn down.

Individual constabulary regiments were retitled &quot;armored cavalry regiments&quot;. This coincided with the 1951 upgrade of the U.S. Army&#x27;s mostly administrative and occupation responsibilities in Germany to a combat army, via the arrival of four combat divisions from the United States. Thus, from 1951 until 1972, the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) patrolled the Fulda Gap. After the return of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment from Vietnam in 1972, the 11th ACR relieved the 14th ACR, and took over the reconnaissance mission in the Fulda Gap until the end of the Cold War.

The mission of the armored cavalry (heavy, mechanized reconnaissance units equipped with tanks and other armored vehicles) in peacetime was to watch the East-West border for signs of pre-attack Soviet army movement. The armored cavalry&#x27;s mission in a war, was to delay a Soviet attack until other units of the U.S. V Corps could be mobilized and deployed to defend the Fulda Gap.

The armored cavalry would have also served as a screening force in continuous visual contact with the Warsaw Pact forces, reporting on their composition and activities, and forcing advancing Warsaw Pact forces to deploy while the cavalry fought delaying actions. In order to defend the Fulda Gap and stop a Warsaw Pact advance, as opposed to conducting screening and delaying actions, U.S. V Corps planned to move two divisions, one armored and one mechanized, forward from bases in the Frankfurt and Bad Kreuznach areas.

From 1947 until 1951, the 1st Infantry Division was the sole U.S. division in Germany, although the various Constabulary units taken together were equivalent in size to another division. U.S. Army forces in Germany were increased in 1951 as a result of President Truman&#x27;s 10 December 1950 declaration of a national emergency as a result of the Korean War, with four divisions arriving from CONUS. This included the 4th Infantry Division, which was stationed in the Frankfurt area, and the 2nd Armored Division, which was located with its headquarters at Bad Kreuznach to the west of the Rhine River. Both of those were the divisions assigned to the newly activated V Corps. In May/June 1956, the 3rd Armored Division (3rd AD) arrived, and was stationed around Frankfurt. In December 1957, the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized) (8th ID) arrived, and was stationed in the Bad Kreuznach area. The two replaced divisions returned to the United States.

The following is a summary of US Cold War history in Germany from the 1950s. US Forces were headquartered at Frankfurt and therefore had an orientation that included the Fulda Gap. The 19th Armored Cav Group activated at Frankfurt on 2 January 1953. On 1 October 1953, the 19th Armd Cav Gp was redesignated as the 19th Armor Group. On 1 July 1955, the 19th Armor Group was replaced by the 4th Armor Group. 

The Seventh Army troop list of 30 June 1956 shows 4th Armor Group attached to V Corps, along with the U.S. divisions, 2d Armored Div, 3d Armored Div, and 10th Infantry Div. USAREUR Troop Lists dated 30 June 1958 show V Corps as containing 3rd Armored Div.(HQ Frankfurt), 8th Infantry Div. (HQ Bad Kreuznach), 4th Armor Group (HQ Frankfurt), and 3rd Infantry Div., which was headquartered at Würzburg. 

After the 1963 ROAD reorganization, the 4th Armor Group was inactivated, and the 3rd Infantry Division headquartered at Würzburg was reassigned to VII Corps. The deployment of the 3rd Armored Division and the 8th Infantry Division to V Corps remained stable until the end of the Cold War. In practice, it was unknown how effective V Corps would have been in the event of war, due to the vast numbers of tanks and infantry that the Soviets were able to field. In response to the quantitative superiority of the Soviet forces, the U.S. deployed Atomic Demolition Mines for many years in the Fulda Gap. 

In the early &#x27;60s, the Fulda Gap was also protected by V Corps Artillery units equipped with the medium-range MGM-5 Corporal guided missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads. In 1962, the more reliable solid fuel MGM-29 Sergeant missile was deployed and remained in use until 1973 when it was replaced by the MGM-52 Lance missile.

For many years, V Corps&#x27; principal adversary was the Soviet 8th Guards Army, which was to be followed by additional armies, including the four armored divisions and one mechanized infantry division of the Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army, making the Fulda Gap a key entry route for the Soviet Bloc to western Europe in any hypothetical battle in Cold War Europe. Both armies were well equipped, and held high-priority for receiving new equipment.

Beginning in 1975, the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategy for attacking Western Europe involved the use of operational manoeuvre groups to outflank NATO defensive positions such as the Fulda Gap.

From 1976 to 1984, the 4th Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division was garrisoned in Wiesbaden and also subordinated to U.S. V Corps.

From 1979 onwards, the first V Corps unit detailed to reinforce the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in the Fulda Gap in the event of hostilities was the 8th Infantry Division&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment (1-68 Armor), stationed at Wildflecken to the south of the Gap. The mission of 1-68 Armor was to establish a defensive line across part of the Gap, providing a shield behind which other V Corps units could advance and defend. Also located in Wildflecken was the 108th Military Intelligence (MI) Btn, to which Delta Company Rangers was assigned. The Rangers&#x27; mission was to strike at the supply lines and command structures of any invading Soviet forces. 

144th Ordnance Company was in charge of much of the ammunition slated for the 8th Infantry Division and the 3rd Armor Division, as well as operating ASP #3 in Wildflecken. 144th Ord. was also responsible for chemical and nuclear ammunition for the Fulda Gap sector, operating ASP #3 and multiple Forward Storage and Transportation Sites. The 54th Engineer Battalion (United States), also garrisoned at Wildflecken, was tasked with destroying critical bridges, roads, and other channels to impede any Soviet advance through the Fulda Gap, as well as provide critical engineering services to enable 1-68th Armor to ease the engagement of Soviet forces.

In September 1980, the 533rd Military Intelligence (MI) Battalion was reactivated in Frankfurt and assigned to the 3rd Armored Division. The 533rd MI Battalion deployed assets in the Fulda Gap to provide electronic warfare capability for the 3rd AD Commander. The missions of the MI battalion were to identify and target invading forces for artillery and air strikes, and to intrude on enemy radio networks using radio jamming and deceptive communications by Defense Language Institute trained Russian and German linguists. The 3rd Armored Division was reinforced with an organic attack helicopter wing, and was the first military unit to deploy the attack helicopter McDonnell Douglas, later Boeing, AH-64 Apache in 1987.

<text>The Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC; formerly the Inuit Circumpolar Conference) is a multinational non-governmental organization (NGO) and Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Organization (IPO) representing the 180,000 Inuit and Yupik (sometimes referred to as Eskimo) people living in Alaska (United States), Canada, Greenland (Kingdom of Denmark), and the Chukchi Peninsula (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia). ICC was accredited by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and was granted special consultative status (category II) at the United Nations in 1983.

The Conference, which first met in June 1977 in Barrow, Alaska (now Utqiaġvik), initially represented indigenous circumpolar peoples from Canada, Alaska and Greenland. In 1980 the charter and by-laws of ICC were adopted. The Conference agreed to replace the term Eskimo with the term Inuit. This has not however met with widespread acceptance by some groups, most pre-eminently the Yupik (see Background section below). The goals of the Conference are to strengthen ties between Arctic people and to promote human, cultural, political and environmental rights and polities at the international level.

ICC holds a General Assembly every four years. ICC is one of the six Arctic indigenous communities to have the status of Permanent Participant on the Arctic Council.

==Background==
The Inuit population includes the following groups and regions:
*Canada: Inuit Nunangat: Central Inuit (Nunavut), Inuvialuit (Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Northwest Territories), Nunavimmiut (Nunavik, Nord-du-Québec), and Nunatsiavummiut or Labradormiut (Nunatsiavut, Labrador) 
*United States (Alaska): Iñupiat, Yup&#x27;ik (Central Yup’ik &amp; Cup’ik), and Siberian Yupik (St. Lawrence Island Yupik)
*Greenland: Greenlandic Inuit: Kalaallit, Inughuit, and Tunumiit
*Russia: Siberian Yupik (Chukchi Peninsula, Chukotka)

All of these peoples are sometimes collectively referred to by the exonym, Eskimo, the use of which is frowned upon by many of the Inuit, especially in eastern Canada. ICC uses the term &quot;Inuit&quot; to refer to them all, which has its own problems. One of those is administrative: an Inuk in the United States could be considered &quot;Native American,&quot; &quot;Alaskan Native&quot; or &quot;Aboriginal American.&quot; The Yupik of both Alaska and Russia generally prefer being called Yupik. Inuit is currently used in Alaska but it is not a word in the Yupik languages, nor a word which they traditionally used to describe themselves. Eskimo, which was formerly used in Alaska is generally dying out.

==Structure and functions==
The main goals of the organization are to strengthen unity among Inuit, to promote their human (Indigenous and Linguistic) rights and interests, and to ensure the development of Inuit culture.

Structurally, the organization is made up of four separate offices in each of the four Inuit homelands, chartered individually under their national rules. The Presidents of ICC Chukotka, ICC Alaska, ICC Canada, and ICC Greenland, along with one Executive Council Member elected from each of the nations, make up the eight-member ICC Executive Council. The Executive Council is presided over by an International Chair (formerly International President—the title was changed in 2002).

ICC holds a General Assembly every four years, bringing together Inuit from across the northern circumpolar region to discuss issues of international importance to their communities, provide direction for the work of the organization over the next four years, and divide responsibility for issue areas between the national offices. Assembly delegates appoint an international chair from the General Assembly host-country, along with the members of the Executive Council, and develop policies and resolutions for the coming term.

The General Assembly, and thus the International Chair position, rotates between the four Inuit nations quadrennially at the General Assemblies. At the 2002 General Assembly in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik, Canada, the Chair passed from Greenland, where it had been held for the previous seven years by Aqqaluk Lynge, now a member of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, to Canada, where Sheila Watt-Cloutier, formerly the President of ICC Canada, took the position.

In 2006, the Chair passed to ICC Alaska at the General Assembly in Barrow, and was then occupied by Patricia L. Cochran, formerly executive director of the Alaska Native Science Commission. At that Assembly, ICC also voted to change its name to Inuit Circumpolar Council as there has been perennial confusion over an organizational name that sounds more like a past meeting.

==Leadership==
The leadership of the ICC was initially organized with one president and three regional vice presidents. A fourth vice-president was added when Russia/Chukotka joined the ICC. The president later came to be unknown as chairperson or international chairperson.

<text>Pula (), also known as Pola (; ; ; ; ), is the largest city in Istria County, Croatia, and the seventh-largest city in the country, situated at the southern tip of the Istrian peninsula in western Croatia, with a population of 52,220 in 2021. It is known for its multitude of ancient Roman buildings, the most famous of which is the Pula Arena, one of the best preserved Roman amphitheaters. The city has a long tradition of wine making, fishing, shipbuilding, and tourism. It was the administrative centre of Istria from ancient Roman times until superseded by Pazin in 1991.

== History ==
=== Pre-history ===
Evidence of the presence of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; one million years ago has been found in the cave of Šandalja near Pula. Pottery from the Neolithic period (6000–2000 BC), indicating human settlement, has been found around Pula. In the Bronze Age (1800–1000 BC), a new type of settlement appeared in Istria, called &#x27;gradine&#x27;, or hill-top fortifications. Many late Bronze Age bone objects, such as tools for smoothing and drilling, sewing needles, as well as spiral bronze pendants, have been found in the area around Pula. The type of materials found in Bronze Age sites in Istria connects these with sites along the Danube. The inhabitants of Istria in the Bronze Age are known as Proto Illyrians.

Greek pottery and a part of a statue of Apollo have been found, attesting to the presence or influence of Greek culture. Greek tradition attributed the foundation of &quot;Polai&quot; to the Colchians, mentioned in the context of the story of Jason and Medea, who had stolen the golden fleece. The Colchians, who had chased Jason into the northern Adriatic, were unable to catch him and ended up settling in a place they called &quot;Polai&quot;, signifying &quot;city of refuge&quot;.

=== Ancient period ===
In classical antiquity, it was inhabited by the Histri, a Venetic or Illyrian tribe.
Strabo, Pomponius Mela and Lycophron wrote that it was inhabited by Colchians.
The Istrian peninsula was conquered by the Romans in 177 BC, starting a period of Romanization. The town was elevated to colonial rank between 46 and 45 BC as the tenth region of the late Roman Republic, under Julius Caesar. During that time the town grew and had at its zenith a population of about 30,000. It became a significant Roman port with a large surrounding area under its jurisdiction.

During the civil war of 42 BC of the triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus against Caesar&#x27;s assassins Brutus and Cassius, the town took the side of Cassius, since the town had been founded by Cassius Longinus, brother of Cassius. After Octavian&#x27;s victory, the town was demolished. It was soon rebuilt at the request of Octavian&#x27;s daughter Iulia and was then called &quot;Colonia Pietas Iulia Pola Pollentia Herculanea&quot;. The colony was part of Venetia et Histria, a region of Roman Italy. Great classical constructions were built of which a few remain.

A great amphitheatre, Pula Arena, was constructed between 27 BC and 68 AD, much of it still standing to this day. The Romans also supplied the city with water and sewage systems. They fortified the city with a wall with ten gates. A few of these gates remain: the triumphal Arch of the Sergii, the Gate of Hercules (in which the names of the founders of the city are engraved), and the Twin Gates. During the reign of the emperor Septimius Severus the name of the town was changed to &quot;Res Publica Polensis&quot;. The town was the site of an execution of two reigning &quot;caesares&quot;, Crispus in 326 AD and Constantius Gallus in 354 AD. In 425 AD the town became the centre of a diocese, attested by the remains of foundations of a few religious buildings.

=== Middle Ages ===


After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city and region were attacked by the Ostrogoths, Pula being virtually destroyed by Odoacer, a Germanic &quot;foederati&quot; general in 476 AD. The town was ruled by the Ostrogoths from 493 to 538 AD. When their rule ended, Pula came under the rule of the Exarchate of Ravenna (540–751). During this period Pula prospered and became the major port of the Byzantine fleet and an integral part of the Byzantine Empire. The Basilica of Saint Mary Formosa was built in the 6th century.

From 788 onwards, Pula was ruled by the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne, with the introduction of the feudal system. Under the Franks it was part of the Kingdom of Italy. Pula became the seat of the elective counts of Istria until 1077. The town was taken in 1148 by the Venetians and in 1150 Pula swore allegiance to the Republic of Venice, thus becoming a Venetian possession. For centuries thereafter, the city&#x27;s fate and fortunes were tied to those of Venetian power. It was conquered by the Pisans in 1192 but soon reconquered by the Venetians.

In 1238 Pope Gregory IX formed an alliance between Genoa and Venice against the Empire, and consequently against Pisa too. As Pula had sided with the Pisans, the city was sacked by the Venetians in 1243. It was destroyed again in 1267 and again in 1397 when the Genoese defeated the Venetians in a naval battle. Pula then slowly went into decline. This decay was accelerated by the infighting of local families: the ancient Roman Sergi family and the Ionotasi (1258–1271) and the clash between Venice and Genoa for the control of the city and its harbour (late 13th and 14th centuries). In 1291, by the Peace of Treviso, Patriarch Raimondo della Torre gained the city as part of the secular realm of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, only to lose it to Venice in 1331, which then held it until its downfall in 1797.

Pula is quoted by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, who had visited Pula, in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;: &quot;Sì come a Pola, presso del Carnaro, ch&#x27;Italia chiude e i suoi termini bagna&quot; or &quot;As Pola, along the Quarnero, that marks the end of Italy and bathes its boundaries&quot;.

=== Venetian, Napoleonic and early Habsburg rule ===
The Venetians took over Pula in 1331 and would rule the city until 1797. During the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, Pula was attacked and occupied by the Genoese, the Hungarian army and the Habsburgs; several outlying medieval settlements and towns were destroyed. In addition to war, the plague, malaria and typhoid ravaged the city. By the 1750s there were only 3,000 inhabitants left in ancient city, an area now covered with weeds and ivy.

With the collapse of the Venetian Republic in 1797 following Napoleon&#x27;s Treaty of Campo Formio, the city became part of the Habsburg monarchy. It was invaded again in 1805 after the French had defeated the Austrians. It was included in the French Empire of Napoleon as part of the Kingdom of Italy, then placed directly under the French Empire&#x27;s Illyrian Provinces.

=== Austrian Littoral province and union with Italy ===

In 1813, Pola (with Istria) came back to the Austrian Empire. Under the compromise of 1867, the town – under the original Italian name, Pola – remained in Austria-Hungary until the latter&#x27;s defeat and dissolution in 1918. Under Austrian rule, Pola regained prosperity. Its large natural harbour became Austria&#x27;s main naval base and a major shipbuilding centre. It was chosen for the base in 1859 by Hans Birch Dahlerup, a Danish admiral in the service of Austria. Subsequently, Pola grew from a fading provincial town into an industrial city. The island of Brioni (in Croatian renamed Brijuni) to the North West of Pola became the summer vacation resort of Austria&#x27;s Habsburg royal family. In World War I, the port was the main base for Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts and other naval forces of the Empire. During this period many inhabitants were Italian speaking. The 1910 Austrian census recorded a city population of 58,562 (45.8% Italian speaking; 15.2% Croatian, the rest were mostly German-speaking military).

Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Pola and the whole of Istria, except the territory of Castua/Kastav, went to Italy. Pola became the capital of the Province of Pola. The decline in population after World War I was mainly due to economic difficulties caused by the withdrawal of Austro-Hungarian military and bureaucratic facilities and the dismissal of workers from the shipyard. Under the Italian Fascist government of Benito Mussolini, non-Italians, especially Croatian residents who came to Pola under Austro-Hungarian rule, faced stringent political and cultural repression because they had now to integrate themselves into the Kingdom of Italy and learn the Italian language. Many left the city and went back to the newly created Yugoslavia. After the collapse of Fascist Italy in 1943, the city was occupied by the German Wehrmacht and remained a base for U-boats. Consequently, the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing from 1942 to 1944. In the last phase of the war, Pola saw the arrest, deportation, and execution of people suspected of aiding the Axis, by the partisans who together with the Yugoslav communists killed many soldiers and civilians, in the first episodes of what would have been named, later on, the Foibe massacres.
=== Post–World War II and modern era ===
After World War II, the Istrian Italians of Pula left Yugoslavia towards Italy (Istrian-Dalmatian exodus). For two years after 1945, Pola was administered by the Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMG). Pola formed an enclave within south Istria that was occupied by Yugoslavia since 1945 with the help of Churchill. The AMG was occupied by a company of the United States 351st Infantry and a British battalion of the 24th Guards Brigade. Istria was partitioned into occupation zones until the region became officially united with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia) on 15 September 1947, under terms of the Paris Peace Treaties. The city became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, a federal state within SFR Yugoslavia, upon the ratification of the Paris Peace Treaties on 15 September 1947 – which also created the Free Territory of Trieste. Initially, Pola&#x27;s population of 45,000 was largely made up of ethnic Italians, however, between December 1946 and September 1947, the vast majority of Italians fled to Italy. Subsequently, the city&#x27;s Croatian name, Pula, became the official name. Today the city of Pula or Pola is officially bilingual, Croatian and Italian, hence both Pula and Pola are official names. Since the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991, Pula has been part of the Republic of Croatia.

== Geography and climate ==

The city lies on and beneath seven hills on the inner part of a wide gulf and a naturally well-protected port (depth up to ) open to the northwest with two entrances: from the sea and through Fažana channel.

Today, Pula&#x27;s geographical area amounts to , on land and at sea, bounded from the north by islands Sv. Jerolim and Kozada, city areas Štinjan/Stignano, Veli Vrh/Monte Grande and Sianna with its &#x27;Kaiserwald&#x27; forest; from the east area Monteserpo, Valmade, Busoler and Valdebek; from the south with the old gas works, commercial port Veruda and island Veruda; and from the west Verudela, Lungomare and Musil.

Protected from the north by the mountain chain of Alps as well the inner highland, the climate is humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;), with the highest air temperature averaging during July and August and lowest averaging , in January and February. Summers are usually quite hot, although some unusual heat wave patterns are also common.

Normally, it is humid. Temperatures above last for more than 240 days a year. There are two different kinds of winds here – the bora brings cold and clear weather from the north in winter, and the southern Sirocco bringing rain in summer. The &#x27;Maestral&#x27; is a summer breeze blowing from the inland to the sea.

Like the rest of the region Pula is known for its mild climate and tame sea with an average of sunny days of 2,316 hours per year or 6.3 hours a day, with an average air temperature of ( in February to in July and August) and sea temperature from to .

== Population ==
Pula is the largest city in Istria County, with a metropolitan area of 90,000 people. The city itself has 57,460 residents (census 2011), while the metropolitan area includes Barban/Barbana (2,802 residents), Fažana/Fasana (3,050 residents), Ližnjan/Lisignano (2,945 residents), Marčana/Marzana (3,903 residents), Medulin/Medolino (6,004 residents), Svetvinčenat/Sanvicenti (2,218 residents) and Vodnjan/Dignano (5,651 residents). Its population density is , ranking Pula fifth in Croatia.

In 1910 Pula had a total of 58,562 inhabitants, of which 45.8% were Istrian Italians, 15.2% Croatians, while the rest of the population was mostly ethnic Germans. The number of Istrian Italians in Pula decreased drastically following the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which occurred from 1943 to 1960.

Its birth rate is 1.795 per cent and its mortality rate is 1.014 per cent (in 2001 466 people were born and 594 deceased), with a natural population decrease of −0.219 per cent and vital index of 78.45. The majority of its citizens are Croats representing 75.88% of the population (2021 census). The largest ethnic minorities are: 2,661 Serbs (5.10 per cent), 1,860 local Italians (3.56 per cent), 1,479 Bosniaks (2.83 per cent), 440 Albanians (0.84 per cent), 357 Slovenians (0.68 per cent).
== Sights ==
The city is best known for its many surviving ancient Roman buildings, the most famous of which is its 1st-century amphitheatre, which is among the six largest surviving Roman arenas in the world and locally known as the Arena. This is one of the best-preserved amphitheatres from antiquity and is still in use today during summer film festivals. During the World War II Italian fascist administration, there were attempts to dismantle the arena and move it to mainland Italy, which were quickly abandoned due to the costs involved.

Two other notable and well-preserved ancient Roman structures are the 1st-century BC triumphal arch, the Arch of the Sergii and the co-eval Temple of Augustus, built in the 1st century AD on the forum during the reign of the Roman emperor Augustus.

The Twin Gates (Porta Gemina) is one of the few remaining gates after the city walls were pulled down at the beginning of the 19th century. It dates from the mid-2nd century, replacing an earlier gate. It consists of two arches, columns, a plain architrave, and a decorated frieze. Closeby are a few remains of the old city wall.

The Gate of Hercules dates from the 1st century. At the top of the single arch, one can see the bearded head of Hercules, carved in high-relief, and his club on the adjoining voussoir. A damaged inscription, close to the club, contains the names of Lucius Calpurnius Piso and Gaius Cassius Longinus who were entrusted by the Roman senate to found a colony at the site of Pula. Thus it can be deduced that Pula was founded between 47 and 44 BC.

The Augustan Forum was constructed in the 1st century BC, close to the sea. In Roman times it was surrounded by temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. This Roman commercial and administrative centre of the city remained the main square of classical and medieval Pula. It is still the main administrative and legislative centre of the city. The temple of Augustus is still preserved today. A part of the back wall of the temple of Juno was integrated into the Communal Palace in the 13th century.

Two Roman theatres have withstood the ravages of time: the smaller one (diameter c. 50 m; 2nd century AD) near the centre, the larger one (diameter c. 100 m; 1st century AD) on the southern edge of the city.

The city&#x27;s old quarter of narrow streets, lined with Medieval and Renaissance buildings, are still surfaced with ancient Roman paving stones.

The Byzantine chapel of Santa Maria del Canneto (or St. Mary Formosa) was built in the 6th century (before 546) in the form of a Greek cross, resembling the churches in Ravenna. It was built by Maximianus of Ravenna, then a deacon, but later Archbishop of Ravenna. It was, together with another chapel, part of a Benedictine abbey that was demolished in the 16th century. The floors and the walls are decorated with 6th-century mosaics. The decoration bears some resemblance to the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna. The wall over the door contains a Byzantine carved stone panel. The 15th-century wall paintings may be restorations of Early Christian paintings. When the Venetians raided Pula in 1605, they removed many treasures from this chapel and took them to Venice, including the four columns of oriental alabaster that stand behind the high altar of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica.

The Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was built in the 6th century, when Pula became the seat of a bishopry, over the remains of the original site where the Christians used to gather and pray in Roman times. It was enlarged in the 10th century. After its destruction by Genoese and Venetian raids, it was almost completely rebuilt in the 15th century. It got its present form when a late Renaissance façade was added in the early 16th century. The church still retains several Romanesque and Byzantine characters, such as some parts of the walls (dating from the 4th century), a few of the original column capitals and the upper windows of the nave. In the altar area and in the room to the south one can still see fragments of 5th- or 6th-century floor mosaics with memorial inscriptions from worshippers who paid for the mosaics. The windows of the aisles underwent reconstruction in Gothic style after a fire in 1242. The belfry in front of the church was built between 1671 and 1707 using stones from the amphitheatre. There also used to stand a baptistery from the 5th century in front of the church, but it was demolished in 1885.

The Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas with its Ravenna-style polygonal apse originally dates from the 6th century, but was partially rebuilt in the 10th century. In 1583 it was assigned to the Orthodox community of Pula, mainly immigrants from Cyprus and Nauplion. The church owns several icons from the 15th and the 16th century and an iconostasis from the Greek artists Tomios Batos from the 18th century.

The star-shaped castle with four bastions is situated on top of the central hill of the old city. It was built, over the remains of the Roman capitolium, by the Venetians in the 17th century, following the plans of the French military architect Antoine de Ville. Since 1961 it houses the Historical Museum of Istria. Close by, on the north-eastern slopes, one can see the remains of a 2nd-century theatre.

The Church of St. Francis dates from the end of the 13th century. It was built in 1314 in the late Romanesque style with Gothic additions such as the rose window. The church consists of a single nave with three apses. An unusual feature of this church is the double pulpit, with one part projecting into the street. A 15th-century wooden polyptych from an Emilian artist adorns the altar. The west portal is decorated with shell motifs and a rose window. The adjoining monastery dates from the 14th century. The cloisters display some antique Roman artefacts.

The &quot;Archaeological Museum of Istria&quot; is situated in the park on a lower level than the Roman theatre and close to the Twin Gates. Its collection was started by Marshall Marmont in August 1802 when he collected the stone monuments from the temple of Augustus. The present-day museum was opened in 1949. It displays treasures from Pula and surroundings from prehistory until the Middle Ages. The building was constructed under Austro-Hungarian rule and was the former k.u.k. &quot;Staatsgymnasium&quot;, the Austrian high school.
The Aquarium Pula is the biggest aquarium in Croatia, located in the Austro-Hungarian fortress Verudela, which was built in 1886 on the peninsula from the centre of the city of Pula. Transforming the fortress into the aquarium has been in progress since 2002. The installation encompasses about 60 tanks on the ground floor, the moat, and the first floor of the fortress. In an area of approximately , visitors can view inhabitants of the Northern and Southern Adriatic Sea, tropical marine and freshwater fish, and representatives of European rivers and lakes. From the roof of the fort, visitors may view the entire city of Pula. It is also possible to see the first marine turtle rescue centre in Croatia.

Fort Bourguignon is one of many fortresses in Pula that the Austrian empire erected to protect the port for its navy.

Nesactium is an ancient hill fort settlement, which is considered to be the oldest urban settlement in Istria. The town is settled about 10 km north of Pula, next to Valtura and Pula Airport. The site itself is located above Bay of Budava, and it is well protected by its steep hills. Nesactium is first mentioned as the main settlement of the Histri, the oldest people on the peninsula, which was the eponym for Istria. Livy was the first who mentioned Nesactium, and the altar dedicated to Emperor Gordian from the 3rd century, where &quot;Res Republica Nesactiensium&quot; is mentioned, confirmed the actual existence of this city. The search for the city began in 1900, when Pietro Kandler first put together the toponym Vizače with ancient Nesactium.

As a result of its rich political history, Pula is a city with a cultural mixture of people and languages from the Mediterranean and Central Europe, ancient and contemporary. Pula&#x27;s architecture reflects these layers of history. Residents are commonly fluent in both Croatian and Italian but also in foreign languages like German and English. From 30 October 1904 to March 1905 Irish writer James Joyce taught English at the Berlitz School; his students were mainly Austro-Hungarian naval officers who were stationed at the Naval Shipyard. While he was in Pola he organised the local printing of his broadsheet &quot;The Holy Office&quot;, which satirised both William Butler Yeats and George William Russell.

== Tourism ==
Pula&#x27;s surrounding natural environment, countryside and the turquoise water of the Adriatic have made the city popular summer holiday destination. The pearl nearby is Brioni island or Brijuni national park visited by numerous world leaders since it was the summer residence of Josip Broz Tito. Roman villas and temples still lie buried among farm fields and along the shoreline of the dozens of surrounding fishing and farming villages. The coastal waters offer beaches, fishing, wreck dives to ancient Roman galleys and World War I warships, cliff diving, and sailing to unspoiled coves and islands large and small.

Pula is the end point of the EuroVelo 9 cycle route that runs from Gdańsk on the Baltic Sea through Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia.

It is possible to track dinosaur footprints on the nearby seashores; certain more important finds have been made at an undisclosed location near Bale.

== Transport ==
Pula had an electric tramway system in the early 20th century. It was built in 1904 as a part of Pula&#x27;s economic crescendo during the Austro-Hungarian rule. After World War I, during the Fascist rule, the need for tram transportation declined and it was finally dismantled in 1934.

Pula Airport is located north-east of Pula, and serves both domestic and international destinations. Similarly to nearby Rijeka Airport, it is not a major international destination. However, this has changed over recent years as low-cost airline Ryanair started scheduled flights to Pula in November 2006. Easyjet offers many flights to UK airports. Jet2 also offers flights from Newcastle, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds-Bradford, Belfast, Manchester, and East Midlands Airports. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) operates scheduled flights from Stockholm and Copenhagen during summertime. Nearby international airports include Trieste, Zagreb and Ljubljana. There are direct flights into Pula airport from London during the whole year and several other large airports in Western Europe during summer.

On 9 April 2015 European Coastal Airlines established a daily seaplane service from the downtown seaplane terminal at the city&#x27;s main waterfront. Destinations as of April 2015 are Rijeka, the island of Rab and Mali Lošinj. The airline ceased operation in 2016.

A train service operates north from Pula through to Slovenia, however, the line remains disconnected from the rest of the Croatian Railways network. Plans to tunnel the &#x27;missing link&#x27; between this line and from Rijeka have existed for many years, and despite work commencing on this project previously, have never seen completion. People traveling to Rijeka or Zagreb by train must get off in Lupoglav and take a bus to Rijeka.

Pula Bus Terminus/Terminal is the main hub for Istria and is located on the edge of town just west of the Amphitheatre. From there, excellent service to a wide range of local, domestic, and international locations is available throughout the year. Several bus companies operate from this Terminus including the local service run by Pulapromet. There is also a guaranteed direct line from Pula to Trieste/Venice, especially into spring/summertime.

Passenger ferries also operate from the port area to nearby islands, and also to Venice and Trieste in Italy from June to September.

<text>E! Entertainment Television is an American basic cable television network. It is owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group division of Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal. The channel focuses primarily on pop culture, celebrity based reality shows and movies.

, E! is available to approximately 71,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households.

==History==

===Movietime===
E! was originally launched on July 31, 1987, as Movietime, a service that aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national barker channel. The channel was founded by Larry Namer and Alan Mruvka. Early Movietime hosts included Greg Kinnear, Katie Wagner, Julie Moran, Suzanne Kay (daughter of Diahann Carroll), Mark DeCarlo, Sam Rubin and Richard Blade.

===E!===

Controlling ownership was originally held by a consortium of five cable television providers (Comcast, Continental Cablevision, Cox Cable, TCI, and Warner Cable), HBO/Warner Communications, and various founding shareholders, with HBO directly programming and managing the network. In 1989, after Time Inc. bought Warner Communications to fend off a takeover bid by Paramount, the new Time Warner company held four of the eight major ownership positions and took over management control of Movietime and renamed the network as E!: Entertainment Television on June 1, 1990 based in Los Angeles; this name change was made to emphasize its widening coverage of the celebrity–industrial complex, contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.

In 1997, Comcast, one of the minority partners, teamed up with Disney/ABC Cable Networks to buy the channel after Time Warner had exercised their put agreement. Comcast increased the ownership stakes in the network through mergers with forerunners of TCI and Continental under various circumstances. In November 2006, Comcast acquired Disney&#x27;s 39.5% share of E! for $1.23 billion to gain full ownership of the network as part of a broader programming carriage agreement between Disney/ABC and Comcast.

In January 2011, Comcast Entertainment Group, the company&#x27;s television unit, became a division of the NBCUniversal Television Group, after Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake in NBCUniversal from General Electric. E!&#x27;s only sister networks prior to the NBC Universal merger were the now-defunct channels Style Network (then Esquire Network), PBS Kids Sprout and G4, along with Comcast&#x27;s sports networks: Versus, Comcast SportsNet and Golf Channel. In the case of Versus, E! staff produced that network&#x27;s &quot;Sports Soup&quot; and G4&#x27;s &quot;Web Soup&quot;, while the Orlando-based Golf Channel featured no crossovers with E! at all due to incompatible audiences and operations. Versus and Golf Channel were taken under the direct control of the NBC Sports division, with the former being renamed NBC Sports Network in January 2012, and are no longer connected to their former sister networks beyond advertising and in-house operations.

On July 9, 2012, the channel introduced a revised logo (the first change to its logo since the network rebranded as E! in 1990), removing the exclamation mark background behind the &quot;E&quot; but keeping the exclamation point underneath, along with a new slogan &quot;Pop of Culture&quot;, which coincided with the launch of the new series &quot;Opening Act&quot;. The network also started the process of introducing scripted programming (the first series, &quot;The Royals&quot;, premiering in March 2015), in addition to its existing reality and documentary series. The changes were announced during E!&#x27;s programming upfront presentation on April 30, 2012.

==Programming==
===News===

E! is one of the few U.S. general-entertainment cable channels that broadcasts a daily news program; its flagship entertainment news program is &quot;E! News&quot;, which debuted on September 1, 1991. The weekday program (which also has an hour-long weekend edition) features stories and gossip about celebrities, and the film, music and television industries, and has been broadcast under various formats since its launch, even being aired live for a time during the mid-2000s. It was first hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. Steve Kmetko was a host from 1994 to 2002. It has been hosted by Terrence Jenkins and Giuliana Rancic since 2012 and 2006, respectively, with Ryan Seacrest (who co-anchored the program from 2006 to 2012) serving as managing editor of the news operation.

&quot;E! News&quot; was the only entertainment news show on the channel for much of its history until 2006, when the channel launched &quot;The Daily 10&quot;, hosted by Sal Masekela and Catt Sadler (Debbie Matenopoulos also co-hosted from the show&#x27;s inception until 2008); the series was cancelled in September 2010 after E! announced that the weekday editions of &quot;E! News&quot; would be expanded to one hour starting on October 25, 2010.

E! also carried a simulcast of business news channel Bloomberg Television from 2004 to January 2009, when the latter network had expanded its cable and satellite carriage to a level that allowed the discontinuation of the simulcast.

Outside &quot;E! News&quot; telecasts, the channel runs an &quot;E! News&quot;–branded news ticker displaying entertainment news headlines each half-hour during regular programming; fast-breaking entertainment headlines (such as a celebrity arrest or death) may also be displayed on a ticker, during any program when warranted.

On August 5, 2020, E! canceled both New York-based shows, along with &quot;In The Room&quot;, one of the first of many program and employee cuts and staff realignments announced across NBCUniversal that week due to the pandemic. The news operation continued to maintain the &quot;E! News&quot; website, and its social media presences.
Two years later, E! announced that &quot;E! News&quot; would be revived as a late-night entertainment news program and would return to the E! network after a two-year hiatus, with Adrienne Bailon-Houghton and Justin Sylvester (the latter of whom returned to the show for the revival) serving as co-hosts; it premiered on November 14, 2022.

===Original series===
The network was known early on for its daily video simulcast of the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot;, which aired from June 20, 1994, until July 8, 2005, weeknights in a truncated half-hour form, airing three times in late night. The program was discontinued several months after Stern moved to Sirius Satellite Radio and sold the video rights to his show to pay-per-view provider In Demand as a monthly pay offering (video rights are now held by Sirius XM).

E! is known for its live red carpet pre-shows for the industry&#x27;s three prominent award shows, the Primetime Emmy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, and the Academy Awards, and were famous for their fashion critiques by Joan Rivers; Rivers also hosted post-awards specials under the title &quot;Fashion Police&quot;, which became a regular weekly series in September 2010. In April 2017, it was announced that E! had acquired the People&#x27;s Choice Awards, which will move to the network from CBS in 2018 with a new November scheduling. The network promoted that the show would be given an &quot;end-to-end&quot; experience that will leverage its existing experience in awards show coverage. As ratings declined across all of cable television overall, the People&#x27;s Choice returned to broadcast television in 2021, with E! simulcasting the ceremony with NBC.

The network also produces many documentary and biographical series, most notably &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;; many of E!&#x27;s original specials are entertainment-related ranging from light fare (such as &quot;25 Cutest Child Stars All Grown Up&quot;) to serious fare (such as &quot;15 Most Unforgettable Hollywood Tragedies&quot;). It also produces specials centering on investigative and crime stories including &quot;E! Investigates&quot;, which features topical investigative reports on subjects ranging from child prostitution to teenage pregnancy.

In recent years, the network has become known for its reality television programs. Its most popular series for over a decade has been &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;, which spawned eight spin-off series and countless specials. Other original reality programming airing on the network currently includes &quot;Total Divas&quot;–a series featuring the WWE&#x27;s Bella Twins, &quot;Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry&quot;, the plastic surgery repair series &quot;Dr. 90210&quot; and &quot;Botched&quot;, along with &quot;Very Cavallari&quot; with Kristin Cavallari and her (later ex-) husband Jay Cutler, &quot;Ladygang–&quot;a television version of the popular podcast, and dating show &quot;Dating #NoFilter&quot;,

E! has had five comedy programs: the late night talk show &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;, hosted by comedian Chelsea Handler, its scripted/improvised spin-off &quot;After Lately&quot;, and &quot;The Soup&quot; (based on the popular 1991–2002 E! series &quot;Talk Soup&quot;), featuring clips of the previous week&#x27;s TV shows with humorous commentary delivered by the host, actor/comedian Joel McHale. Handler also produced &quot;Love You, Mean It&quot;, a weekly comedic look at pop culture hosted by Whitney Cummings, and a nightly talk show from actress Busy Philipps, &quot;Busy Tonight&quot;. &quot;The Soup&quot; returned in February 2020, with new host Jade Catta-Preta, though it, and many of E!&#x27;s in-studio shows, were cancelled in the last quarter of 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic hampering production.

On September 8, 2020, it was announced the network&#x27;s most popular series &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; would be ending with season 20 in 2021.

===Acquired series and films===
Over the years, E! has occasionally run acquired programming including reruns of &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot; lifestyle-based interview shows from ABC (since removed under NBCUniversal ownership), and edited 60-minute versions of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, though fewer of these programs currently air. The only programming currently airing on E! that it does not produce are broadcast standards-edited reruns of the former HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; originally carried by HBO&#x27;s sister network TBS, and feature films that air under the banner &quot;Movies We Love&quot;; the latter was part of a since-abandoned initiative by the network to use films to increase the network&#x27;s ratings, though the branding remains, and low and mid-grossing female-focused films from the Universal Pictures library usually receive their basic cable premiere on E!, with higher-grossing films premiering on USA Network. The network has aired same-week runs of NBC series (such as &quot;The Voice&quot;, &quot;Fashion Star&quot;, &quot;Whitney&quot;, and &quot;Are You There, Chelsea?&quot;), and in the past aired previews of G4 programming to give that network an extended promotional platform due to their lowered carriage when it was removed from DirecTV in November 2010. The network also airs selected shows from the Peacock streaming service (which E!&#x27;s parent company NBCUniversal owns).

=== Sports programming ===
Since Comcast&#x27;s acquisition of NBCUniversal, E! has infrequently aired sporting events as an overflow outlet for NBC Sports. It has participated in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Championship Sunday&quot; effort to broadcast all matches on the final matchday of the Premier League soccer season. In January 2022—amid the shutdown of long-time sister channel NBCSN—E! was incorporated into NBC Sports&#x27; coverage of two figure skating events ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics, the 2022 European Figure Skating Championships and Four Continents Figure Skating Championships. E! would be involved in NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics.

==E! HD==
E! HD is a high definition simulcast feed of E! launched on December 8, 2008, in Comcast&#x27;s default 1080i resolution format. Currently, the network&#x27;s entire original programming roster post-2010 is carried in high definition, along with most films. Available on the vast majority of pay television providers, it is downscaled at the provider headend level to provide a standard definition equivalent for those systems.

During E!&#x27;s run as a broadcast service in Canada, the &quot;E! Ontario&quot; version of the service until the December 2008 discontinuation of the E! broadcast television system was available in HD over Hamilton, Ontario-based CHCH-TV (channel 11) on its channel 18 ATSC digital signal, though the majority of E!&#x27;s programming outside American primetime series before the shutdown of the television system was not available in the format.

==&quot;E! Online&quot;==
&quot;E! Online&quot; is the online arm of E!, featuring live updates on entertainment news stories; the website includes an online-only entertainment news bulletin titled &quot;E! News Now&quot;, which is updated each weekday. The website also provides live streaming video of major red carpet events including movie premieres and award shows such as the Academy Awards and the Emmys, along with some blogs involving shows such as &quot;The Soup&quot;. Columnists featured on the website include Kristin dos Santos (the &quot;Watch with Kristin&quot; television blog), Ted Casablanca (&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; gossip blog), and Marc Malkin (writer of an eponymous gossip blog and host of a daily video blog on the site).. The website was ranked among the best of 1998 by Entertainment Weekly.

As part of the rebrand of the cable channel on July 9, 2012, EOnline.com was redesigned for HTML5, including tablet and mobile devices.

Some of E!&#x27;s programs were brought to the Philippines and remade in a local version, one of which was &quot;Wild On! Philippines&quot;.

<text>Esquire Network was an American pay television network that was a 50/50 joint venture between NBCUniversal and the Hearst Corporation. Launched on October 1, 1998 as Style Network, a spin-off of E!, the channel initially consisted of fashion, design, and urban lifestyle-themed programming. In 2008, Style shifted its programming towards personality-centric reality shows. The network was relaunched as Esquire Network on September 23, 2013; said rebrand was supposed to be on G4, but that was given to Style due to G4&#x27;s low ratings. As Esquire Network, the channel focused on travel, cooking, sports and fashion, and also aired reruns of popular sitcoms and dramas.

Due to low ratings and subsequent carriage decline by cable providers, Esquire Network ceased operations as a cable channel on June 28, 2017, to become an online-only brand; no further comments have been made about the online-only model since.

==History==
===Style Network===
The channel was originally launched as Style Network (although on-air promotions typically referred to it as simply &quot;Style&quot;) on October 1, 1998, serving as a spin-off of E!. It was intended to leverage E!&#x27;s coverage of fashion and to provide an expanded venue for shows such as &quot;Fashion Emergency&quot;. The network focused on fashion, design, interior decoration and urban lifestyle-related programming. Style provided coverage of events like New York Fashion Week and showcased various designers. Early programming included: &quot;The Look for Less&quot;, &quot;Shabby Chic with Rachel Ashwell&quot;, &quot;Glow: The Beauty Show&quot;, &quot;Vogue Takes...&quot;, &quot;Stylemaker&quot;, &quot;Model&quot;, &quot;Runway&quot;, &quot;Dining with Style&quot;, and &quot;Homes with Style&quot;. Around 2003, the channel began airing a variety of &quot;makeover&quot; shows. The home makeover show &quot;Clean House&quot; lasted for ten seasons on the network; &quot;How Do I Look?&quot; lasted eight seasons.

Starting around 2008, Style shifted its focus to personality-based reality programing such as &quot;Jerseylicious&quot;, &quot;Tia &amp; Tamera&quot;, and &quot;Big Rich Texas&quot;, along with a female-focused spin-off of &quot;The Soup&quot; known as &quot;The Dish&quot;. On June 25, 2012, Style Network was rebranded with a revised logo and a new slogan: &quot;Work it. Love it. Style it.&quot; In 2013, the channel launched two real estate related shows: &quot;Hot Listings: Miami&quot; and &quot;Built&quot;, which featured male models remodeling houses.

===Esquire Network transition===
In December 2012, NBCUniversal signed a brand licensing deal with the Hearst Corporation, owner of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, to relaunch G4 into Esquire Network, which would air shows aimed at a metrosexual audience about travel, cooking, fashion and other male-targeted programming that is not sports related, including the addition of acquired and archived program content from the NBCUniversal library such as &quot;Party Down&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; and week-delayed episodes of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

The rebranding was scheduled to take place on April 22, 2013, but was moved to an unspecified date in the summer on April 15, 2013, as network general manager Adam Stotsky stated the rebranding was pushed back in order to have a broader slate of original series to launch than would have been available for the April launch. In May 2013, the launch date was pushed to September 23, 2013, with its first program being an 80th anniversary special on &quot;Esquire&quot; which was rebroadcast later in primetime.

On September 9, 2013, NBCUniversal announced that it would replace Style Network with Esquire Network, leaving G4 &quot;as is for the foreseeable future, though it&#x27;s highly unlikely the company will invest in more original programming&quot; according to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. One of the factors was likely Style&#x27;s distribution on DirecTV, giving Esquire more homes at launch with the Style channel slot than they would have had with G4 (G4 had earlier been dropped by DirecTV in 2010 due to the channel&#x27;s low viewership and had never been able to come to terms on a new carriage agreement). 

This forced last-second changes to Esquire Network&#x27;s planned schedule outside of primetime. Cable-edited reruns of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (a series which took heavy criticism from &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine during its original run) remained on its schedule until December 2013 (when the rights were shifted to E!), with most of Style&#x27;s series quietly shelved, or transferred to E!, Bravo and Oxygen. International versions of Style Network continued to exist several years after, as the Esquire brand license was restricted solely to the United States. The original iteration of G4 ceased on December 31, 2014.

The sudden change in networks surprised both viewers and providers, who had already shifted or expected the G4 channel space to a more appropriate place among other men&#x27;s networks, and now had to deal with shifting Esquire&#x27;s channel position away from women&#x27;s networks, along with having to answer customer inquiries about the sudden demise of the Style Network and its programming. More privately, talent which had been brought on for Style programming, including the Mowry twins, reacted angrily to seeing their projects cancelled without notice or be shifted among other networks with different programming priorities, and NBCUniversal would have to deal with the repercussions of ending a network&#x27;s life with only two weeks&#x27; notice.

Style made no mention of the oncoming rebranding until September 18, when a 60-second farewell clip was posted on its YouTube channel serving as a retrospective of the network&#x27;s history and ending with a thanks to the channel&#x27;s audience for their viewership. Other social media platforms for individual Style programs also began to mention the end of the network on that day. The last program to air on Style on September 22, 2013, was an overnight repeat of the &quot;Tia &amp; Tamera&quot; season finale episode &quot;Twerkin&#x27; 9 to 5&quot; (which became its de facto series finale as Tia and Tamera Mowry opted not to continue with the series) at 2 a.m. Eastern Time, with the nightly three-hour paid programming block leading into the Esquire Network launch special after a 30-second abbreviated version of the Style farewell clip aired on the channel space. The changeover occurred on September 23, 2013, at 6 a.m. Eastern Time.

===2016–2017 carriage decline===
Throughout 2015 and into 2016, the majority of the original programs produced for Esquire Network ended up being low-rated, with only the youth football reality series &quot;Friday Night Tykes&quot; and the network&#x27;s Men in Blazers–produced live broadcasts of Pamplona&#x27;s running of the bulls receiving any critical acclaim or notice. The rest of its lineup was criticized for depending on derivative and &quot;copycat&quot; formats of better programming, which was often found on other networks or produced for free consumption independently and uploaded to streaming video providers such as YouTube and Vimeo. After only several months, the network stopped airing repeats of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; after its February 2014 end, immediately upon his move to the higher-profile &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, which NBC refused to dilute the value of with cable repeats.

&quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;, which had started on G4, was expected to be a linchpin of Esquire Network&#x27;s lineup, but with the delay of the network&#x27;s launch to the fall of 2013, NBCUniversal did not want to wait to launch the season, and the program had success airing on NBC during the summer as repeats in previous seasons. The show&#x27;s sixth season, which had been taped expecting to air as part of Esquire Network and visually featured its logo in prominent places, then moved to NBC for the 2014 summer season, and airing as a new season on the broadcast network, proved the show&#x27;s worth with great ratings. NBCUniversal decided to move the series permanently to NBC, leaving Esquire Network with repeats rather than new episodes, and even before its launch, removing one of the network&#x27;s G4-era critical series from being used to promote its other content.

Though it did receive a spin-off as consolation, &quot;Team Ninja Warrior&quot;, Esquire Network had no other compatible programming to promote it, and it never cracked the top 100 cable shows in any of its first season airings. It was moved to USA Network for its second season and beyond.

Press attention for the network&#x27;s programming soon was limited to the bookends of their premieres, then to their eventual notice of cancellation, including little to no promotion from &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine itself due to a lack of compatible promotion. The magazine, which under the brand licensing deal was expected to be used to source new series ideas or its writers participating in factual programming such as countdowns, was also severely underutilized, with most of the content developed for the network ending up being from traditional talent pipelines used by NBCUniversal, rather than the magazine itself.

Due to these multiple issues, the network began to carry more repeats of existing library comedy and drama series (many of which were seen over-the-air for free on sister networks Cozi TV, LXTV, and NBC&#x27;s streaming apps, along with other NBCU networks), which again brought the network towards the same issues befalling G4, Chiller, and Cloo, where little original content being produced made it a network viewers and providers claimed provided little value for its monthly carriage fees.

On October 1, 2016, Dish Network removed the channel from the lineup. As with their earlier dropping of Cloo, the provider stated that most of the network&#x27;s rerun-centric programming was duplicative of that available on other networks and streaming services. The only notice of the dropping was through the provider&#x27;s monthly billing statement. AT&amp;T then gave notice that Esquire Network would be dropped from U-verse and DirecTV on December 15, 2016, a move that cut the network&#x27;s availability by 25% and removed almost all consumer-based satellite service availability outside of niche C-Band consumers. Charter Communications through its Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Spectrum subsidiaries removed the channel from their lineup nationwide on April 25, 2017 (the same day they removed Chiller from their lineup, also nationwide), leaving Verizon FiOS and Google Fiber as a few of the last cable providers to carry Esquire Network until its demise; online access to the network&#x27;s TV Everywhere live feed was maintained by Charter until the network&#x27;s termination.

===End of operations===
On January 18, 2017, it was announced that the network would end all pay television distribution in the summer of 2017 and convert to an online-only model. The network went off the air on June 28 at noon Eastern time. The network programmed a final marathon of &quot;Friday Night Tykes&quot; that day, ending with the season one finale, &quot;Finish What We Started&quot;. After the episode ended, a &quot;thank you&quot; slide was shown with the network&#x27;s web address (which shortly thereafter was turned into a redirect to the main Esquire website). No further comment was made in regards to the supposed online-only version of the network, and Esquire&#x27;s &quot;TV&quot; section on their website now contains the general features and behind-the-scenes footage prevalent on most magazine sites. The network&#x27;s final two projects, &quot;Edgehill&quot; (a true crime series about the Murder of Suzanne Jovin) and &quot;Borderland USA&quot; (a reality series about the U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit) were promised to air on the new digital version of the network, but have since been abandoned.

By coincidence, G4&#x27;s Canadian network outlived both its mother American network and the Esquire Network, ending operations on August 31, 2017, two months longer than Esquire.

G4 would relaunch in the United States in a new hybrid cable-digital form on November 16, 2021, after a year of lead-up promotions and announcements, though it ended operations itself on November 18, 2022.

Hearst has since re-established &quot;Esquire&quot;-branded programming through the stations of Hearst Television and its streaming network Very Local beginning in 2021, with &quot;In Transit&quot;, a tourism travelogue series hosted by Dave Holmes.

==Programming==
==International==

Internationally, Style Network was launched in the Arab world in December 2007 on Showtime Arabia, across Southern and Western Africa during back in November 2007 on DStv, in the United Kingdom and Ireland on June 10, 2008, in Japan on World on Demand, Australia in November 2009, and Poland in August 2011. The network was also launched in CEE, from February 19, 2011, until May 1, 2014

Style Network continues to air in international markets, though its British/Irish version ceased operations on December 9, 2013, while its African version ceased operations on March 31, 2015. The brand licensing agreement with Hearst for Esquire Network was exclusive to the United States, and NBCU and Hearst never pursued any international versions for Esquire Network.

In 2014, the Australian version of the Style Network made its first local commission, &quot;Fashion Bloggers&quot;, after its American counterpart rebranded. Style Australia shut down on 17 December 2019 as part of a restructuring of NBCU&#x27;s Australian operations and a broad re-map of Foxtel&#x27;s channel lineup.

<doc id="528115" wikidata="Q4150814" url="?curid=528115" title="Formation skydiving">
<text>Formation skydiving is a skydiving event where multiple skydivers attach themselves to one another by grabbing each other&#x27;s limbs or by the use of &quot;grippers&quot; on their jumpsuit while free falling through the sky. The goal of this skydiving program is to build a formation of multiple divers arranged in a geometric pattern.

==Sub-categories==

Formation skydiving can be further divided into several sub-categories, so named for the number of members in a team:
*4-way sequential
*4-way vertical sequential (VFS, Vertical Formation Skydiving)
*8-way sequential
*16-way sequential
*10-way speed
*Large formations (Big-ways)

==Competitive format==

A competition in 4-way formation skydiving (FS-4) takes place like this:

There are two kinds of formations, called randoms and blocks. The randoms are singular formations with full separation of all grips both before and after building the formation. The blocks are double formations with a special designated movement pattern in between, called an inter. The start formation may, or may not be similar to the ending formation. The inters are differently performed. Here are some examples:

Inter 1: The grips are released between some of the flyers, so they become two pieces of two team members. they both do a 270 degree turn, and reconnect to a different formation

Inter 2: Three people stay connected, and do a 360 turn, while the last person, flies alone.

Inter 15: All grips are released and everyone does a 360 turn back to the original formation.

Blocks are designated by numbers, while randoms got letters. Blocks are worth one point for each correct formation, that makes 2 points, and randoms count as 1 point. There are 22 blocks and 16 randoms.

competition consists of up to 10 rounds, and each round consists of 5 or 6 points, which the teams are to repeat as many times as they can within the working time of 35 seconds. The score judging are based on the videographers material.

A competition draw may look like this:
*1: C-E-B-13
*2: 14-20-8
*3: 15-16-H
*4: J-O-1-D
*5: 6-18-19
*6: 5-F-21
*7: 10-K-G-M
*8: 22-3-P
*9: 12-9-4
*10:11-17-Q

The winning team will be the team that has collected most points, by completing the most correct formations within time after the final round is ended. In case of weather or technical problems, or other causes, a competition will be valid as long as all teams has completed at least one round.

A recent sub-category of formation skydiving is vertical formation skydiving (VFS). Skydivers build formations using higher-speed body positions normally associated with freeflying, such as head down and sitflying.

==World record==

*BIG-WAY:
The current FAI world record for largest free-fall formation is a 400-way, set on February 8, 2006, in Udon Thani, Thailand by the World Team. It was held for 4.3 seconds. With the support of the Thai government, they used five C-130 Hercules airplanes and exited from an altitude of 25,400 feet. In April 2013 the World Team tried to break the record for the largest 2-point formation dive in skydiving history. All 222 members came together and made a formation, broke apart, and then reformed to make a completely different formation. The team attempted the jump many times and came very close to breaking the record, but were unsuccessful each time. The World Team has not made anymore official statements about attempting the record again. 

Longest sequence in one round:
*4-Way
Set by the Belgian team(NMP-PCH Hayabusa), at the World Meet 2018 in round 6, where they posted 62 points in working time (35 seconds)
*8-Way
Set by the U.S. (GKXP8) national team, at the World Meet 2024 , in round 9, where they posted 37 points in working time (50 seconds)

<doc id="528116" wikidata="Q3521397" url="?curid=528116" title="The Integral Trees">
<text>The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by American writer Larry Niven (first published as a serial in &quot;Analog&quot; in 1983). Like much of Niven&#x27;s work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, &quot;The Smoke Ring&quot;, was published in 1987.

It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1984, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1985.

==Setting==
The story occurs around the fictional neutron star Levoy&#x27;s Star (abbreviated &quot;Voy&quot;). The gas giant Goldblatt&#x27;s World (abbreviated &quot;Gold&quot;) orbits this star just outside its Roche limit and therefore its gravity is insufficient to keep its atmosphere, which is pulled loose into an independent orbit around Voy and forms a ring that is known as a gas torus. The gas torus is huge—one million kilometers thick—but most of it is too thin to be habitable. The central part of the Gas Torus, where the air is thicker, is known as the Smoke Ring. The Smoke Ring supports a wide variety of life.

No &quot;ground&quot; exists in the Smoke Ring; it consists entirely of sky. Furthermore, the Smoke Ring is in orbit and therefore in free fall: there is no &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. Most animals have trilateral symmetry that allows them to see in all directions. The majority of Smoke Ring animals have evolved to fly on at least an occasional basis—even the fish. The Smoke Ring contains numerous &quot;ponds&quot;, globs of water of various sizes which float free like everything else. While there are aquatic and amphibious animals in the Smoke Ring that live the majority of their lives in such ponds, these animals may find their habitat unsuitable at any moment. Whether their home pond drifts too far out of the habitable center of the Smoke Ring and into the gas torus, becomes too large and breaks up due to tidal forces, or impacts a large object such as an integral tree, aquatic animals must be able to propel themselves through the air sometimes in order to find a new place to live.

Most plants in the Smoke Ring are quite fragile because they do not need to support their own weight. A notable exception to this rule are the eponymous Integral Trees, which can grow up to 100 kilometers long. Tidal locking causes them to be radially oriented, with one end pointing in toward Voy while the other points toward space. The ends of the tree feel a tidal force of up to on the largest trees. Each end of a tree is a green, leafy tuft.

An integral tree tuft is up to 50 kilometers from the tree&#x27;s center of mass. Thus, a tuft is either orbiting too slowly (the &quot;in&quot; tuft) or too quickly (the &quot;out&quot; tuft) compared to the atmosphere, which is in orbit at all points. The ends of the tree are therefore subject to a constant gale-force wind that causes the ends to curve into the shape of an integral symbol ∫ and pushes water and food onto the tufts, or (less forcefully) onto the trunk, where the gravity-like tidal forces pull the material out towards the tufts.

Each tuft serves several main purposes for the tree. First, the green foliage is photosynthetic, providing the tree with energy from sunlight; second, the tufts are where the tree produces its seeds; and third, various plants, animals, and sundry other objects can become trapped in the tighter branches, which gradually migrate toward the &quot;treemouth&quot;. The treemouth, a pit at the top of each tuft on the lee side of the trunk, is the integral tree&#x27;s root; water collected along the trunk flows down due to tidal forces and is ingested by the treemouth. Tuft branches catch and capture various things and animals in the wind and gradually, over the course of years, migrate to the treemouth, where they and their catch are absorbed by the tree for nourishment. Many other large Smoke Ring plants have a scavenger/carnivore aspect similar to this, though with somewhat different mechanisms.

==Plot summary==

Twenty astronauts aboard an interstellar &quot;ramship&quot; colonized the Smoke Ring five hundred years before the story begins. Their descendants have adapted their cultures to the free-fall environment. Without gravity, even those who live in integral tree tufts are much taller than Earth-average humans, having grown up in much weaker tides. Many people are able to use their longer, prehensile toes as another set of fingers. The small number of devices left from the original crew are coveted items in Smoke Ring societies.

Quinn Tribe inhabits the &quot;in tuft&quot; of Dalton-Quinn tree. They normally subsist on the tree&#x27;s cottony foliage, augmented by hunting and a flock of domesticated turkeys. But since the tree passed near Gold six earth years ago it has been falling toward Voy, nearly dropping out of the Smoke Ring. As a result, the tribe suffers a severe drought. The tribe&#x27;s leader, the chairman, decides to send a party of nine up the tree, ostensibly to hunt and re-cut tribal markings into the trunk. The group consists mostly of people with disability and people the chairman dislikes, including the chairman&#x27;s son-in-law (and rival) Clave, and Jeffer, the Scientist&#x27;s apprentice.

When they approach the midpoint they notice that the tribal markings are different; upon reaching it, they are attacked by members of the Dalton-Quinn tribe who live at the other end of the tree. During the battle a massive tremor splits the tree in half, causing the in tuft to fall farther toward Voy (killing its inhabitants) and allowing the out tuft to find a new equilibrium that is closer to the Smoke Ring&#x27;s median. The seven surviving members of the Quinn Tribe and one of the attackers jump clear of the shattered tree and are left adrift in the sky with only a few &quot;jet pods&quot; (high pressure seed cases that provide a temporary thrust when opened) as their only method of propulsion.

Before dying of thirst, they hook a passing &quot;moby&quot; (a flying whale-like creature) which takes them to a &quot;jungle&quot;, which is a floating mass of plant life. They cut loose, crash, and find themselves in the middle of a battle between the Carther States, who live in the jungle, and slave-runners from London Tree. The group is split when six of them are captured by the slavers; the other two remain in the jungle.

Carther States counter-attacks some weeks later, and the Quinn Tribe group is reunited. During the battle they steal London Tree&#x27;s CARM (Cargo And Repair Module), a small spacecraft—a relic of the original settlers. The CARM is still functional due to careful management and its robust design; its solar panels provide electricity to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen, which it stores automatically and then burns for propulsion as needed. London Tree&#x27;s &quot;Navy&quot;, bow- and spear-armed warriors, use the CARM to conduct long-distance military actions and slave raids on a scale impossible for wingless humans in a zero-g environment.

Not fully understanding how to pilot the CARM, the Quinn and Carther warriors engage its main rocket motor, which accelerates the ship at several &quot;g&quot;, enough to prevent the crew from reaching the controls to turn the motor off. The CARM is propelled up into the thinnest part of the gas torus before running dangerously low on fuel. As a result, they become the first Smoke Ring inhabitants in centuries to see the naked stars.

Unknown to any of the inhabitants of the Smoke Ring, &quot;Discipline,&quot; the ship in which their ancestors arrived, remains in orbit, and its AI autopilot, Kendy, has been attempting to watch their progress. When Kendy sees the CARM dangerously far from the habitable area of the Ring he contacts them. With help from the on-board computer and after some interaction with Kendy, the occupants of the CARM eventually safely return to the Smoke Ring. Unable to reach any of the trees that they know, they decide to settle on a new tree, which they dub &quot;Citizens&#x27; Tree&quot;.

<doc id="528121" wikidata="Q1759969" url="?curid=528121" title="Lunar Lander (video game genre)">
<text>Lunar Lander is a genre of video games loosely based on the 1969 landing of the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon. In Lunar Lander games, players control a spacecraft as it falls toward the surface of the Moon or other astronomical body, using thrusters to slow the ship&#x27;s descent and control its horizontal motion to reach a safe landing area. Crashing into obstacles, hitting the surface at too high a velocity, or running out of fuel all result in failure. In some games in the genre, the ship&#x27;s orientation must be adjusted as well as its horizontal and vertical velocities.

The first Lunar Lander game was a text-based game published under many names, including the &quot;Lunar Landing Game&quot;, written in the FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim Storer while a high school student in the fall of 1969. Several other versions were written soon after by other programmers in FOCAL and BASIC. The original &quot;Lunar Landing Game&quot; was converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl, who included three versions in his 1973 book &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot;. By the end of the decade, the type of game was collectively known as a &quot;lunar lander&quot; game.

In 1973, DEC commissioned the creation of a real-time, graphical version of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals. The game, written by Jack Burness and named &quot;Moonlander&quot;, was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. In 1979, Atari released a vector graphics arcade video game version of the concept as &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;. It has a fuel-for-money system allowing the player to purchase more fuel to continue their current game.

Lunar Lander games were a popular concept for home computer systems. Commodore published a version called &quot;Jupiter Lander&quot; for their VIC-20 in 1981. That same year, &quot;Electronic Games&quot; wrote that &quot;sometimes it seems as though every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme.&quot;

==Text games==

The original Lunar Lander game was a 1969 text-based game published under many names, including the &quot;Lunar Landing Game&quot;. It was originally written in the FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim Storer while a student at Lexington High School in the fall of 1969, and uploaded to the system library as &quot;Rocket&quot; after Christmas break. His computer teacher submitted the game under the name &quot;FOCAL Lunar Landing Simulation (APOLLO)&quot; to the DEC users&#x27; newsletter, which distributed the source code to readers under the name &quot;Apollo&quot;. Different versions of the game were later submitted by other authors, including &quot;Apollo II&quot; and &quot;Apollo 12&quot;. DEC published a book of FOCAL-8 programs in 1970 and included the game as &quot;Lunar Module&quot;. Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called &quot;Rocket&quot; was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and another BASIC version, &quot;LEM&quot;, was written by William Labaree II, among others.

The text-based games require the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the Moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original &quot;Lunar&quot;, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing ten seconds of travel time. &quot;Rocket&quot; added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while &quot;LEM&quot; added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, &quot;Lunar&quot; and &quot;Hamurabi&quot;, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.

In 1973, Ahl released the book &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot;, which contained the source code of computer games written in BASIC. The games included were written by both Ahl and others and included both games original to the language and games ported from other languages such as FOCAL. &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; was a landmark title in computer games programming and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies sold. Its second edition in 1978, titled &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;, was the first million-selling computer book. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe computer games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games. Included in the book were all three versions of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). Ahl and Steve North then converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC and published them in &quot;Creative Computing&quot; magazine and the &quot;Best of Creative Computing&quot; collection in 1976; they were reprinted in the 1978 edition of &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot; as &quot;Lunar&quot;, &quot;LEM&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&quot; as the most popular of the existing versions of the game.

The first known use of the name &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; for a video game of this type was in the 1975 book &quot;What to Do After You Hit Return&quot;, a collection of BASIC computer games by the People&#x27;s Computer Company similar to Ahl&#x27;s book, which included versions named &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;. Prior to that, in 1970, the name was used for an electro-mechanical arcade game by former Atari, Inc. employees operating as Cointronics, in which the player uses a joystick to land a lunar lander model on targets, though it is unclear if the game was inspired by the video games or solely by the actual lunar lander. Another &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; video game was commercially distributed for some programmable calculators such as in 1975 for the Hewlett-Packard HP-25. With the advent of home computers in 1977, the game concept soon moved to those systems as well, with &quot;Moon Lander&quot; (1977) for the MK14 computer kit, which displayed the lander&#x27;s speed, height, and fuel consumption on an eight-character calculator-style display, as an early example. While Ahl did not list a common name for the three similar titles in his book, the style of game was collectively seen as its own subgenre, with &quot;InfoWorld&quot; referring to &quot;LEM&quot; in February 1979 as &quot;a lunar lander&quot; and &quot;Antic&quot; terming the set of text-based games as &quot;Lunar Landers&quot; in 1986.

==Graphical games==

In 1973, DEC commissioned the creation of a real-time, graphical version of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant and former employee, and named &quot;Moonlander&quot;; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, &quot;Moonlander&quot; is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land an Apollo Lunar Module on the surface of the Moon using the game&#x27;s telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module&#x27;s landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the Moon&#x27;s surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness completed the game on February 25, 1973, after spending ten days developing it plus one day visiting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which had co-designed the actual Apollo Lunar Module. There, he got the actual specifications for the lander, which he used to create the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original &quot;Lunar&quot;, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. A few months prior to making the game, he attended the December 6 launch of the Apollo 17 Moon landing mission, which may have inspired the creation of the game.

&quot;Moonlander&quot; was the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander gets close to the Moon, the view changes to a close-up view of the surface and lander. If the player successfully lands the spaceship, an astronaut climbs out to stand on the surface—the first depiction of a human in a video game and possibly the first cutscene in a video game. &quot;Moonlander&quot; was also the first video game to include an easter egg; if the player flies their ship horizontally enough in the close-up view, they encounter a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant which the astronaut will visit upon landing and which the player can destroy by crashing the lander into it. Modified versions of &quot;Moonlander&quot; were made, with at least one renaming it to a variant of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; such as &quot;RT-11 Lunar Lander&quot;, and another removing the McDonald&#x27;s, as seen in a 1979 Dutch short film &quot;Mens en computer&quot; (&quot;Human and Computer&quot;). A port for the iPad was released for free by Paradigm Systems in 2013.

In August 1979, Atari, Inc. produced an arcade video game version of the concept as &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;. It uses monochrome vector graphics and allows the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters via proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like &quot;Moonlander&quot;, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface as well as a text readout of the ship&#x27;s speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; was Atari&#x27;s first vector graphics game. The vector engine was inspired by &quot;Space Wars&quot; (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Wendi Allen,&quot;&quot; who developed &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Allen, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely &quot;Moonlander&quot;, a few years prior; Atari employees had also seen &quot;Moonlander&quot; years prior at the NASA Ames Research Center and attempted to create an arcade version with raster graphics in 1975. Another arcade game based on the &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; concept from around the same time is &quot;Lunar Rescue&quot; (1979) by Taito.

Graphical Lunar Lander games have been produced for other systems. Although some were named &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, many were not; regardless, the name of the type of game continued to be &quot;lunar landers&quot;. Bill Budge developed &quot;Tranquility Base&quot; for the Apple II in 1980. Commodore published &quot;Jupiter Lander&quot;, a raster version of the game, in 1981 for the VIC-20 and 1982 for the Commodore 64. IBM released &quot;Rocket Lander&quot; for the IBM PC in 1982. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; magazine published a BASIC version of the game for the Commodore 64 in April 1984. Tom Hudson wrote &quot;Retrofire&quot;, a more elaborate version of the lander concept for Atari 8-bit computers in 1983; it uses a 3D isometric view, so there are three velocities to control (along the X, Y, and Z axes). Other games include &quot;Apollo 11&quot; (1983) for the ZX Spectrum, &quot;Marslander&quot; (1983) for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro, and versions of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; for the Commodore PET and TRS-80.

&quot;Lunar Rescue&quot; (1988) for the Macintosh combines Lunar Lander gameplay with an economic model and trade simulation. George Moromisato developed &quot;Lander&quot; for Windows 3.1x in 1990, Nintendo released a version of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; for the Game Boy that same year, and Psygnosis released a 3D, commercial version for Microsoft Windows in 1999 titled &quot;Lander&quot;. Modern versions and remakes have been made for computers, consoles such as the Wii U, iOS, Android, mobile phones, and browsers.

==Reception==
In the 1978 edition of &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;, David Ahl described the text-based version of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; as &quot;by far and away the single most popular computer game&quot; of the time. &quot;Moonlander&quot; was similarly popular among users of DEC graphics terminals. The &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; arcade game proved popular and commercially successful, selling approximately 4,700 cabinets. Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) became so much more popular, however, that 300 &quot;Asteroids&quot; games were released in &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; cabinets.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; in 1982 as one of the first fun programs entry level programmers start with and continually improve upon as they improve their skills. By 1973, there were numerous versions of the text-based game, and so many versions of the graphical game existed by 1981 that &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, in a review of a version by Scott Adams for Atari 8-bit computers and the TRS-80, claimed it was &quot;yet another entry in a field as crowded as the category of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; imitators. Sometimes it seems as though every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme.&quot; &quot;Moon Lander&quot; for the MK14 was one of the first three commercial games in Britain for home computers. At least one metagame exists; &quot;Antic&quot; in March 1986 published &quot;Lunar Lander Construction Set&quot; for Atari 8-bit, in which the player constructs a custom graphical Lunar Lander. In &quot;Science Fiction Video Games&quot; (2014), while discussing the games&#x27; lack of science fiction concepts like aliens or unrealistic physics, Neal Roger Tringham described the series as &quot;one of the few video games to be based on a real space program, as opposed to the many games inspired by fictional forms of space exploration&quot;.

<doc id="528126" wikidata="Q2045695" url="?curid=528126" title="Shock rock">
<text>Shock rock is the combination of rock music or heavy metal music with highly theatrical live performances emphasizing shock value. Performances may include violent or provocative behavior from the artists, the use of attention-grabbing imagery such as costumes, masks, or face paint, or special effects such as pyrotechnics or fake blood. Shock rock also often includes elements of horror.

==History==
Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins has been seen as a pioneer for shock rock. After the success of his 1956 hit &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, Hawkins began to perform a recurring stunt at many of his live shows: he would emerge from a coffin, sing into a skull-shaped microphone and set off smoke bombs. Another artist who performed similar stunts was the British singer-songwriter Screaming Lord Sutch.
The 1960s brought several proto-shock rock artists. In the UK, the Who often destroyed their instruments, the Move did the same to television sets, and Arthur Brown wore vivid makeup and a flaming headpiece. In the US, Jimi Hendrix set his guitar alight at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Detroit musician Iggy Pop of the Stooges adopted a violent, erratic onstage persona which drew widespread recognition, as Pop would often throw his body about the stage, frequently injuring his band members. Pop was known to wear a dog collar during some performances, along with arm length silver lamé gloves, exemplifying both shock and glam rock sensibilities. At at least one show in 1970, Pop smeared peanut butter on his body and threw it into the crowd as well.

On seeing Arthur Brown, Alice Cooper, often described as &#x27;The Godfather of Shock rock&#x27;, stated, &quot;Can you imagine the young Alice Cooper watching that with all his make-up and hellish performance? It was like all my Halloweens came at once!&quot;

The Plasmatics were an American punk rock band formed by Yale University art school graduate Rod Swenson with Wendy O. Williams. The band was a controversial group known for wild live shows. In addition to chainsawing guitars, blowing up speaker cabinets and sledgehammering television sets, Williams and the Plasmatics blew up automobiles live on stage. Williams was arrested in Milwaukee by the Milwaukee police before being charged with public indecency. Jim Farber of &quot;Sounds&quot; described the show: &quot;Lead singer/ex-porn star/current weight lifter Wendy Orleans Williams (W.O.W. for short) spends most of the Plasmatics&#x27; show fondling her family size breasts, scratching her sweaty snatch and eating the drum kit, among other playful events&quot;.

From the late 1970s to his death in 1993, GG Allin was known less for his music than for his wildly transgressive antics, which included indecent exposure (stripping and performing naked was one of Allin&#x27;s most common rituals), on-stage defecation, coprophagia, self-mutilation, and attacking audience members.

In the 1980s in Richmond, Virginia, Gwar formed as a collaboration of artists and musicians. The band members make their own lavish monster costumes, which they claim are inspired by many of the creatures from H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s literary multiverse, the Cthulhu Mythos. Gwar frequently incorporates extravagant theatrics into their shows, such as mock jousts and pretending to murder each other.

The Mentors cultivated a shock-rock image by wearing executioners&#x27; hoods in concert and making deliberately outlandish statements to the press. In the 1990s, vocalist Eldon Hoke also began incorporating onstage sex acts into the band&#x27;s repertoire.
In the 1990s and 2000s, Marilyn Manson became perhaps the most notable and well known act in shock rock. He was once dubbed by former US Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn) as &quot;perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.&quot; Manson&#x27;s stage antics, such as burning the American flag and ripping pages out of the Bible, have been the focus of protests throughout his career. Manson argued that every artist has their means of presentation and that his visual and vocal styles are merely a way for him to control the angle that his audience and the general public view and interpret what he is trying to convey artistically.

<doc id="528128" wikidata="Q975100" url="?curid=528128" title="Nick Fury">
<text>Colonel Nicholas Joseph &quot;Nick&quot; Fury Sr. is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer/artist Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee, he first appeared in &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; #1 (May 1963), a World War II combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping man as leader of an elite U.S. Army Ranger unit.

The modern-day character, initially a CIA agent, debuted a few months later in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #21 (December 1963). In &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #135 (August 1965), the character was transformed into a James Bond-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel books as the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D., and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the United Nations and various superheroes. It is eventually revealed that he takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being nearly a century old, later leading to him becoming The Unseen, herald of Uatu the Watcher, and forming a new team of Exiles.

Nick Fury appears in several Marvel series set in alternate universes, as well as multiple animated films, television shows, and video games based on the comics. The character was first portrayed in live-action by David Hasselhoff in the television film &quot;Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (1998), with Andre Braugher portraying General Hager, a character based on Fury, in &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; (2007). Jeff Ward also portrayed Deke Shaw, a character based on the original Fury, from the fifth to the seventh season of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (2017–20).

A version of the character appearing in Marvel&#x27;s 2001 Ultimate Marvel imprint was based on Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s appearance and screen persona. When the character was introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot;, Jackson was cast in the role, which he has played in eleven films, the first season of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (2013–14), and the Disney+ series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021) and &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; (2023). The recognizability of the character portrayed by Jackson in the films later led Marvel in 2012 to retire the original character from his role with S.H.I.E.L.D., replacing him with his son Nick Fury Jr., who is also patterned on Jackson.

== Publication history ==
=== Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos ===

Fury first appeared in the World War II combat series &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot;, as the cigar-chomping NCO who led a racially and ethnically integrated elite unit. The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 – December 1981), though only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974). Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, penciller Dick Ayers began his long stint on what would be his signature series; John Severin later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed team. Roy Thomas succeeded Lee as writer, followed by Gary Friedrich, who became a signature series as well. Annuals featured the &quot;Howlers&quot; called back to fight in the Korean War and Vietnam War.

The Howling Commandos encountered Office of Strategic Services agent Reed Richards (later Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) in #3 (September 1963) and fought alongside Captain America and Bucky in #13 (December 1964).

=== &quot;Strange Tales&quot; and solo series ===

In &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #135 (August 1965), Fury, now a colonel, became a James Bond-esque Cold War spy, with Marvel introducing the covert organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division) and its nemesis Hydra.

The 12-page feature was initially created by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the Helicarrier – an airborne aircraft carrier – as well as human-replicant LMDs (Life Model Decoys), and even automobile airbags. Lee recalled in 2005:

Writer-penciller-colorist Jim Steranko began on the feature in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #151 (December 1966), initially over Kirby layouts. He quickly became one of comic books&#x27; most acclaimed and influential artists. In some of the creative zeniths of the Silver Age, Steranko established the feature as one of comic books&#x27; most groundbreaking and innovative. He popularized in comic books such art movements of the day as psychedelia and op art; built on Kirby&#x27;s longstanding work in photomontage; and created comic books&#x27; first four-page spread. All the while, he spun plots of intense intrigue, barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness—and supplied his own version of Bond girls, pushing what was allowable under the Comics Code at the time.

The 12-page feature ran through &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #168 (sharing that &quot;split book&quot; with the occult feature &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; each issue), after which it was spun off into its own series, titled &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D&quot;. This ran 15 issues (June 1968 – November 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (November 1970 – March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1–3 and #5 and drew the covers of #1–7.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; to &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In 1972, &quot;Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos&quot; celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the squad, sponsored by Stan Lee and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comic books professionals, has made occasional cameos in his own books, in a tradition going back to the 1940s Golden Age of Comic Books). The matter of Fury apparently not aging significantly since his term of service in World War II was justified in &quot;Assignment: The Infinity Formula&quot; by the writer Jim Starlin and artist Howard Chaykin in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #31 (December 1976), revealing Fury&#x27;s age-retarding medication treatment.

A six-issue miniseries, &quot;Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (June–November 1988) was followed by &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; vol. 2. The latter series lasted 47 issues (September 1989 – May 1993); its pivotal story arc was &quot;the Deltite Affair&quot;, in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with Life Model Decoys in a takeover attempt.

A year after that series ended, the one-shot &quot;Fury&quot; (May 1994), using retroactive continuity, altered the events of those previous two series. The &quot;Fury&quot; one-shot had cast them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of HYDRA head Baron von Strucker. The following year, writer Chaykin and penciller Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four-issue miniseries &quot;Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (April–July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury&#x27;s solo adventures, such as the graphic novels and one-shots &quot;Wolverine/Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection&quot; (1989), &quot;Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising&quot; (October 1994), &quot;Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty&quot; and &quot;Captain America and Nick Fury: Blood Truce&quot; (both February 1995), and &quot;Captain America and Nick Fury: The Otherworld War&quot; (October 2001). He starred in the 2004–2005 &quot;Secret War&quot; miniseries.

In the 2018 &quot;Exiles&quot; series &quot;The Unseen&quot; will recruit characters to combat an unknown galactic threat.

In May 2023 Marvel published a double sized one-shot &quot;Fury&quot; made to commemorate the character&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Early life and wartime ===
Nicholas Joseph Fury is the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury in New York City. His father is a United States citizen who enlists in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Jack enlists in 1916 and is stationed in France. He shoots down Manfred von Richthofen early in his flying career and is a highly decorated combat aviator by the end of the war in 1918.

Discharged after the war, Jack returns home, marries an unnamed woman, and becomes the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the late 1910s or early 1920s, is followed by his brother Jake Fury (later the supervillain Scorpio who co-founded the Zodiac cartel), and their sister Dawn.

All three children grow up in the neighborhood known as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan, New York. Nick is an amateur boxer through the New York City Police Athletic League, where he also learns marksmanship. As a teenager in 1937, he went overseas for the first time to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was on leave in Guernica when the fascists bombed it.

After he returns to America, Fury and his friend Red Hargrove leave the neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing walking and parachuting act. In the early 1940s, their death-defying stunts catch the attention of Lieutenant Samuel &quot;Happy Sam&quot; Sawyer, who was then training with the British Commandos, who enlists them for a special mission in the Netherlands. Nick and Red later join the U.S. Army, with Fury undergoing basic training under Sergeant Bass. Nick and Red are stationed together at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii when the Imperial Japanese Navy ambushes the base on December 7, 1941. Red is among the many killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor, with Fury swearing vengeance against both the Japanese and the Nazis.

Sawyer, now a captain, assigns Fury command of the First Attack Squad, a unit of U.S. Army Rangers, who are awarded the honorary title of commandos by Winston Churchill after their first missions. They are nicknamed the &quot;Howling Commandos&quot; and stationed at a military base in the United Kingdom to fight specialized missions, primarily but not exclusively in the European Theatre of World War II. During this period, Fury falls in love with a British nurse, Lady Pamela Hawley, who dies in a bombing raid on London before he can propose to her.

=== C.I.A. ===
At the end of World War II in Europe, Fury is severely injured by a land mine in France, and is found and healed by Berthold Sternberg, who uses him as a test subject for his Infinity Formula. After making a full recovery, Fury begins working for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Six months into his service, he learns the extent of Sternberg&#x27;s life-saving operation: the Infinity Formula has stopped his aging, but if he does not receive annual doses, he will age rapidly and die. The doctor begins a 30-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange for the injections.

Fury segues into the CIA as an espionage agent, gathering information in Korea. During this time the Howling Commandos are reformed, and Fury receives a battlefield commission to lieutenant. He later reaches the rank of colonel. During this time, he recommends the recruitment of married agents Richard and Mary Parker, who will go on to become the parents of Fury&#x27;s occasional superhero ally Spider-Man. Much later, the CIA uses him as a liaison to various super-powered groups that have begun appearing, including the Fantastic Four, whom CIA agent Fury first encounters in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #21 (Dec. 1963).

During his time with the CIA, Fury begins wearing his trademark eyepatch. &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot; #27 (Feb. 1966) revealed that he had taken shrapnel to one eye during World War II, which caused him to slowly lose sight in it over the course of years.

=== S.H.I.E.L.D. ===
Fury becomes the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. as its public director. The ultimate authority of S.H.I.E.L.D. is revealed to be a cabal of 12 mysterious men and women who give Fury his orders and operational structure, leaving Fury to manage the actual implementation of these orders and stratagems. The identities of these people have never been revealed; they appear only as shadowy figures on monitors. Initially, his organization&#x27;s primary nemesis is the international terrorist organization Hydra, created by Fury&#x27;s worst enemy of World War II, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (after retconning of the original continuity). Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grows into one of the world&#x27;s most powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments and forming strategic alliances with the Avengers and other superhero groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. Fury soon becomes the superhero community&#x27;s main contact when government-related information is required in order to deal with a crisis.

After years at the helm, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra have both fallen under the control of a group of sentient Life Model Decoy androids known as Deltites. Betrayed, Fury goes underground and is hunted by his fellow agents, many of whom are later revealed to have been replaced with Deltites. Although Fury ultimately exposes and overcomes the Deltite threat, the conflict is so destructive to S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s personnel and infrastructure, and leaves Fury so disillusioned, that he disbands the agency to prevent it from again being subverted from within.

Fury rebuilds S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up, initially as a more streamlined agency small enough for him to personally oversee and protect from being corrupted. This new incarnation changed the acronym to stand for &quot;Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate&quot;.

Sometime later, Frank Castle, the vigilante known as the Punisher, is captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D. escort. During a hypnosis session with Doc Samson, a character named Spook interferes with the session and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury is responsible for the murder of the Punisher&#x27;s family. An escaped Punisher eventually kills Fury, who is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The Fury that the Punisher has &quot;killed&quot; is later revealed to have been a highly advanced Life Model Decoy android.

Returned to his post as S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury independently enlists the superheroes Captain America, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine, Daredevil, and the Black Widow to launch a covert assault on the leadership of Latveria, which is plotting a massive attack on the U.S. One year afterward, Latveria launches a counterattack that results in Fury&#x27;s removal as S.H.I.E.L.D. commander, forcing him again into hiding with numerous international warrants out for his arrest. His successors as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. are first Maria Hill and then Tony Stark. Both Hill and Stark, keeping Fury&#x27;s disappearance secret from the S.H.I.E.L.D. rank and file, use Life Model Decoys to impersonate Fury on occasion.

Fury is the only &quot;33rd-degree&quot; S.H.I.E.L.D. officer (meaning he is the only member of S.H.I.E.L.D., present or past, to know of the existence of 28 emergency, covert bases scattered across the globe) secretly providing the anti-registration faction in the subsequent superhuman civil war with bases where they can rally their forces without worrying about their Pro-Registration enemies finding them.

=== Secret Invasion ===

During the time Fury spends in hiding, he learns that Valentina Allegra de Fontaine has been plotting to extract S.H.I.E.L.D. passcodes from him and kill him. Fury kills her first, after which she reverts to the form of an extraterrestrial shapeshifter from the hostile Skrull race, which has mounted an invasion of Earth. He recruits Spider-Woman to be his mole inside both Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D., and to watch for further Skrull impostors. Unbeknownst to him, she&#x27;s replaced shortly after by Skrull Queen Veranke herself. He later instructs former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson to recruit superpowered children of various heroes and villains to help combat the Skrull invasion; these include Phobos, the 10-year-old son of Ares and himself the young god of fear; Yo-Yo, a misunderstood mutant speedster; Hellfire, a relative of Phantom Rider with supernatural powers; Druid, a magician and son of Doctor Druid; and Stonewall, a young man who can grow bigger at will and has super strength. Fury dubs them his &quot;Commandos&quot;.

Soon after the attack on Earth, Fury and his new team are seen counter-attacking the Skrull attack in Times Square, Manhattan. They manage to repel and kill the invaders in the area significantly, whilst saving the downed cadets and the Young Avengers. He, along with his team and the rescued heroes, are next seen working and planning their next move in one of the scattered 28 covert S.H.I.E.L.D. bases. He has been seen talking to Deadpool, while Deadpool was on a Skrull ship after pretending to join them. It is revealed that Fury hired Deadpool to infiltrate Skrull ranks by pretending to defect, with the intention of obtaining biological information of the Skrulls that Fury can use to stop them. When Deadpool attempts to transmit the data, it is intercepted by Norman Osborn.

Fury leads the survivors of the Young Avengers and Initiative back to the fight in New York, where they are joined by Thor, the new Captain America, the New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers, the Hood&#x27;s gang, and the Thunderbolts, to take on Veranke&#x27;s army of Super Skrulls.

=== Dark Reign and Secret Warriors ===
During an infiltration and elimination of a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Chicago, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is, and always has been, secretly controlled by Hydra. A distraught Fury now plans to use his Secret Warriors to combat the renewed Hydra threat, spearheaded by his old nemesis, Baron Strucker. He hires the new Howling Commandos, a private military company formed by 1200 former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who refused to join Norman Osborn&#x27;s H.A.M.M.E.R., to employ them in his fight against Hydra and Osborn. He has a number of inside men to assist in his raids, including Natasha Romanova posing as Yelena Belova who is in command of the Thunderbolts. Eventually, he and his men commandeer decommissioned Helicarriers, as well as forcing the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents at the dock to follow him. Natasha brings Songbird to Fury, but she is followed and the three are captured by the Thunderbolts. Osborn then shoots Fury in the head. It was not the real Fury who was shot, but a Life Model Decoy in his image, which the Fixer reveals to Songbird and Black Widow later after they escape the Thunderbolts.

On a solo mission soon after, Fury teams with Norman Osborn to interrogate a lower-level H.A.M.M.E.R. agent. The conversation (and materials obtained afterwards) reveal there may be an organization much like Hydra, installed in the upper levels of world governments, called &quot;Leviathan&quot;. This organization appears to have been founded by the Soviet government for reasons as yet unclear. Fury later introduces Daisy Johnson to prominent members of the Howling Commandos including Alexander Pierce, leader of the second caterpillar team, and Mikel, Fury&#x27;s son and leader of the &quot;gray&quot; team.

=== Siege ===
Fury and the Secret Warriors are later summoned by Captain America to his hideout along with the New and Young Avengers, when Rogers, seeking to aid his long-time comrade Thor in his plight during the Siege of Asgard launched by Norman Osborn, gathered all his allies to strike back against Osborn and rescue Thor whilst simultaneously ending Osborn&#x27;s Dark Reign. Fury insists on Phobos remaining behind due to an unwillingness for him to battle his father Ares and his youth, and later opens a wormhole aboard an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. jet which brings the combined forces of the three teams to Oklahoma. They then intercept Norman Osborn&#x27;s siege and with the help of Iron Man, who receives a variation of his suit from Speed, they shut down Norman&#x27;s suit. Their victory is cut short when Sentry, now fully possessed by the Void, begins attacking them. Loki attempts to help Fury and the other heroes by empowering them with the Norn Stones, but Void kills him before long. Iron Man then uses the ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier as a bullet on the Void. Robert Reynolds regains control of his body and begs the Avengers to kill him. Thor refuses but ends up killing him anyway when Void begins to take over again. The Avengers are reunited, and the press declares that a new &quot;Heroic Age&quot; has begun.

=== Heroic Age ===
While Fury remains underground, allowing Steve Rogers to take official command of the super-spy side of things, he remains in contact with Earth&#x27;s heroes and monitors their activities. He provides the New Avengers with a special serum, created as a combination of the Super-Soldier serum and the Infinity Formula, to help Mockingbird when she was shot during a raid on a H.A.M.M.E.R. base. Fury later expends the last sample of the Infinity Formula to save Bucky&#x27;s life. He remains immortal due to trace amounts of the formula in his body.

=== Battle Scars ===
In 2012, the six-part series &quot;Battle Scars&quot; introduces Nick Fury&#x27;s secret son, Sgt. Marcus Johnson who is an African American and ends up losing one eye in the series. The character has been described as looking like Samuel L. Jackson, just as the Nick Fury of the Ultimate Universe does. Nick Fury retires at the end of the series, and his son joins S.H.I.E.L.D. Upon joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Johnson changes his name to his original birth name of Nick Fury Jr., as he and Agent Coulson appear on the Helicarrier in the final page.

=== Original Sin ===

During the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, Nick Fury is called upon to help investigate the murder of Uatu the Watcher. Fury is attacked and beheaded by the Winter Soldier. When the investigating teams – including Black Panther, Emma Frost, Doctor Strange and the Punisher – attempt to pursue Bucky, they find a space station of unknown origin. &quot;Fury&quot; is revealed to be a highly advanced Life Model Decoy, with the space station containing the real, elderly, Nick Fury and several LMDs. Fury relates an account from 1958, when as a member of U.S. Army Intelligence, he encountered an invasion of alien Tribellians in Kansas. He witnessed Woodrow McCord destroying the home planet of the aliens, before himself being fatally injured. When McCord&#x27;s partner Howard Stark arrived on the scene, he decided to recruit Fury to continue his work as defender of the planet. Nick Fury accepted and explains that over the decades he defended the Earth against threats through virtually any means whatsoever, including systematic torture against aliens, genocide against planetary civilizations, and warmongering spanning entire galaxies. The corpses discovered recently by the superhero investigators were threats that Fury had neutralized. Fury reveals that he has rapidly grown elderly and is dying because the Infinity Formula in his body has been depleted. He explains that he chose each of the heroes assembled so that one of them can replace him. His refusal to answer the Black Panther&#x27;s demand for an explanation of what happened to Uatu leads to a battle between the heroes and the LMDs, during which Fury activates Uatu&#x27;s eyes. Fury fights off most of the attacking heroes – including revealing an undisclosed secret to Thor that causes him to lose the ability to wield his hammer. Fury confesses that he killed Uatu in potential self-defense after Doctor Midas and the Orb had first attacked him. Fury took one of Uatu&#x27;s eyes, needing to know who mounted the assault and Uatu&#x27;s oath preventing him from revealing that information directly. After killing Midas, Fury is shown wandering the Moon in chains and wearing long robes that hide his face from view and unable to interfere as &quot;The Unseen&quot;, becoming Uatu&#x27;s replacement while the Winter Soldier takes his place as Earth&#x27;s &quot;Man on the Wall&quot;.

===The Unseen===

Following the continuity-changing events of the 2015 miniseries &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Fury returned as &quot;the Unseen&quot;, advising Odinson of the existence of another hammer. He muses later that, while he is essentially another person from Nick Fury now, he still retains Fury&#x27;s regret at destroying Thor with a whisper, hoping that the news of the new hammer will help Odinson recover what he once was. Odinson also admits that the secret that made him unworthy was &quot;Gorr was right&quot;, referencing how Gorr the God-Butcher believed that no gods were worthy of worship, although Odinson&#x27;s ally Beta Ray Bill assures him that his willingness to continue fighting for others proves that this does not apply to Odinson.

Later while the Unseen still cannot interfere with the events he is observing, he is able to summon Blink to him and tells her of things going on in the greater multiverse, terrible creatures that are destroying time, space and dimension, and tells her that she is chosen by the device to act as protector of the very fabric of the multiverse. However, due to this interference in the timestream, a faction of Watchers assaulted him with the objective of ending his involvement, even if it means the end of the multiverse.

He has also continued Uatu&#x27;s tradition of observing parallel universes, including observing a reality where Flash Thompson became Spider-Man only to turn himself in after accidentally killing Peter Parker. It is also revealed that the Maker is aware of the Unseen&#x27;s existence.

After the &quot;Empyre&quot; event, the Unseen observes as the Avengers, Fantastic Four, Kree/Skrull Alliance, and Cotati end the oldest war in the universe. As Quoi is held captive, Wolverine detects a presence nearby, and Thor notes that they are being watched. Later, the Unseen retrieves ancient weapons from the First Race, predating the Elders of the Universe, Asgardians, and Celestials. Examining them, the Unseen discovers their origin and is overwhelmed with energy as the one-eyed Uatu is resurrected. Uatu only says, &quot;There shall be...a reckoning&quot; when asked how he came back to life.

===Reckoning War===
While reconstructing his home, Uatu learns of how Nick Fury became Unseen by tapping into the Cyclopedia Universum. It revealed that three of Uatu&#x27;s brothers and sisters broke their non-interference vow by judging Nick Fury and fusing what&#x27;s left of Uatu with Nick Fury making him a human/watcher hybrid that they chained to a rock. After viewing some of the good things that Unseen did and the weapons used by the Cotati which caused Uatu to be revived, he states that the technology did not belong to the Cotati. While he cannot commute Nick Fury&#x27;s sentence, he does release him from his punishment by removing the chains on him since he needs an operative to get the job done and makes Nick Fury his herald. The first war is coming and Uatu states that everything and everyone is in peril as Nick Fury accepts his offer to aid him.

During the &quot;Reckoning War&quot; storyline, Nick Fury and Uatu meet up with Mister Fantastic to inform them about the Reckoning. When Uatu tries to appeal to the other Watchers for help, he is condemned to watch the &quot;What If&quot; scenario he never looked at himself in the form of a world where he never interfered by alerting the FF to the coming of Galactus, which ended with the team suffering serious injuries but driving Galactus back and reverse-engineering Galactus&#x27;s technology to create a new power source for Earth. Uatu is left condemned to watch this world in a loop for the rest of his life as punishment for his interference, but Nick Fury followed the Watchers and managed to release Uatu from the chair. At the same time, Fury was able to reveal to Uatu that the vision he was being shown ended just before it was revealed that Reed&#x27;s new energy generator would overload and erase the universe, leaving Uatu shaken but assured that his interference was right after all.

In the conclusion, Uatu builds a new Watchtower for Fury and entrusts him to secure the Ultimate Nullifier as the Unseen and humanity&#x27;s shield.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
According to the comic books, Nick Fury&#x27;s aging has been slowed greatly by the Infinity Formula, a serum created by Dr. Berthold Sternberg. Fury was first inoculated with the serum in the 1940s. Fury took the serum annually for many years. Originally Fury had to take the formula annually or the effects would be reversed, allowing his body to reach its actual chronological age. Nick Fury is depicted as an active athletic man despite his advanced chronological age, though writers have sometimes portrayed Fury as being past his prime despite the Infinity Formula as in the &quot;Fury and Wolverine&quot; graphic novel. As of the &quot;Original Sin&quot; story arc, it is revealed that at some point the Infinity Formula stopped working for him and Fury has only pretended to stop aging by using LMDs.

Fury&#x27;s injured left eye, though initially minimally affected by a grenade blast during World War II, has over the decades resulted in a 95% loss of vision in this eye. Despite some comments to the contrary, Fury has not had the eye removed, nor bionically enhanced, and he merely covers it with a cosmetic eye-patch to prevent depth perception distortion. He has explained that when needing to disguise himself, he only needs to remove the eyepatch, slip in a contact lens and darken his hair, as everyone always looks for a one-eyed man.

Fury is a seasoned unarmed and armed combat expert, was a heavyweight boxer in the army (during World War II) and holds a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a brown belt in Jiu Jitsu. He has further honed his unarmed combat skills sparring with Captain America. The character is a combat veteran of three wars, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, as well as numerous &quot;military adviser&quot; missions and clandestine operations (&quot;a dozen conflicts you&#x27;ve never even heard of&quot;). He is trained as a paratrooper, Ranger, a demolitions expert, vehicle specialist (including aircraft and seagoing vessels), and a Green Beret.

Fury has access to a wide variety of equipment and weaponry designed by S.H.I.E.L.D. technicians. He wears a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform made of 9-ply Kevlar (able to withstand ballistic impact up to .45 caliber bullets) and a Beta cloth (type C), a fire-resistant material, which has a kindling temperature of . Fury uses various types of handguns, including a .15 caliber needle gun, a government issue .45 caliber automatic, a captured German Luger in 9mm Parabellum, a modified semi-automatic Walther PPK in 9 mm Parabellum, and the Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol in .45 ACP.

As the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury has access to the entire S.H.I.E.L.D. highly advanced arsenal of weaponry; various air, land, and sea craft provided by S.H.I.E.L.D.; and numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. paraphernalia, including a radio-link tie and a bulletproof suit. Due to his high-ranking status, even when S.H.I.E.L.D. is directed by Tony Stark, Norman Osborn and Steve Rogers, Fury retains access to several S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouses and paraphernalia that are unknown to anyone else but him.

After his transformation into The Unseen, Nick Fury now possesses the same Cosmic Awareness as the Watchers, which grants him the ability to observe different timelines, allowing him to see the past, present and even possible futures of every alternate timeline.

He met Philip Sheldon, who asked for an interview for a book he was writing. Fury assaulted Sheldon thinking he was a political writer, and insisted that he had no connection with the recently-deceased Avengers, then telling him that it was Captain America that introduced him to eating human meat during World War II. After shooting a rabid dog, Fury sat on the corpse until approached and solicited by Jean Grey, a prostitute. Killing her, then igniting a nearby car, he told Sheldon he needed to take a short nap, then put the gun under his chin and pulled the trigger.

Fury and Dum Dum Dugan appear in the alternate universe toy-license series &quot;The Transformers&quot; #3 (Jan. 1985).

=== Ultimate Marvel ===

In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, General Nick Fury is African American born in Huntsville, Alabama, with his look and personality closely tailored after actor Samuel L. Jackson who eventually went on to play the live-action adaptation of Nick Fury within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Nicholas Fury fought for the United States in World War II. During the invasion of Sicily, he, along with Private Fisk (the grandfather of Wilson Fisk) and Canadian paratrooper Corporal Howlett, attempted to loot a house. American military police arrived to arrest them, and all three were subdued. Fisk was grazed by a bullet, while Fury was imprisoned in an unknown location alongside several other black men, and Howlett, despite protests that he was Canadian, was also shipped to an unknown location. Fury was selected to be the next test subject for Project: Rebirth, as his blood work most closely matched that of subject #22, the most successful of the previous test subjects. He was injected with a serum that gave him super-strength, which he used to free himself and the other prisoners, who then escaped. The scientists who were working on him let him escape, deciding that they have all the information that they needed for now.

After attending college in India, Fury enlisted in the U.S. military, where he was deployed into various conflicts such as the Kosovo War. He was later assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Weapon X program in the original Gulf War. While transporting the mind-wiped Wolverine in an adamantium cage, an Iraqi guerrilla ambushed and killed his team, inadvertently freeing Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and re-imprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed. The next day, Fury, already mostly healed, was confronted by General Thaddeus Ross. The general had discovered much was unusual about Fury and questioned him at length, prompting him to reexamine where he was going in life.

Years later, the X-Men were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by Wraith, who had previously staged a coup against General Ross. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the Brotherhood of Mutants, Wraith was about to kill Nightcrawler, but was shot dead by Fury.

Fury is summarily promoted to general and resumes the duties of the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle posthuman threats and resurrecting the supersoldier program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the Ultimates. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with the revived World War II hero Captain America and billionaire genius Iron Man. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring superhumans who are not affiliated with the U.S. military, including Peter Parker and the X-Men.

Nick Fury lost his right arm in a battle against the Liberators in &quot;The Ultimates 2&quot;. He replaced it shortly thereafter with a bionic one.

Nick Fury has also been involved in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; comics. In them, he meets Peter after Norman Osborn returns. He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the OZ spider biting Peter, as well as Doctor Octopus screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail. Nick Fury has been watching Peter and informs him that, due to his illegal genetically-altered status, he will become the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns eighteen. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed because the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury&#x27;s relationship became strained after the &quot;Hobgoblin&quot; arc. Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why Harry Osborn became the Hobgoblin. At that point, Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about OZ and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his spider powers. This follows on to the &quot;Ultimate Clone Saga&quot;, in which it is revealed by Fury that the Tinkerer&#x27;s Spider-Slayers were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane. Mary Jane Watson, upon discovering Fury&#x27;s intentions, tells him that Peter looks up to him like a father. This convinced Fury to let Peter keep his powers, and he apologizes to Peter, stating that in his line of work he&#x27;s been trained to expect someone in Peter&#x27;s position to crack under stress.

During &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;, Fury was judged to be at least partially responsible for the devastation of much of Earth-31916 along with Emil Burbank. Burbank had sought a means to defeat the Hyperion of that universe. An alien organism, unleashed in an attempt to achieve this, spread throughout the United States, causing widespread devastation. A probe sent by Reed Richards provided evidence that an &quot;invasion from another universe&quot; was responsible. The Squadron Supreme was dispatched to the Ultimate Universe in order to arrest Richards so that he could stand trial for his &quot;crimes&quot;. A lengthy battle ensued between the Squadron on one side and the Ultimates, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four on the other. Richards, believing himself to be responsible when the squadron produced his probe as evidence, surrendered himself. Fury was unwilling to accept this and convinced Thor to create a bridge to Earth-31916, through which the helicarrier was able to travel. Once there, another battle between the squadron and the Ultimate Universe heroes began. Spider-Man learns that Fury had an ulterior motive - the retrieval of the probes and their data, and had conspired with Doctor Doom to do so. In addition, Fury had brought insurance in the form of the Hulk. It took the combined power of the Ultimate Universe heroes, the Earth-31916 Squadron Supreme, and their counterparts from Earth-712 to defeat the Hulk, but Doom had proven to be simply a Doombot. To stop the fighting, the Ultimates agreed to turn over Fury to the Earth-31916 squadron and to allow Power Princess to return with them to their universe. Fury tries to convince them that they are making a mistake, but his pleas are ignored.

Fury is seen still stranded in Earth-31916 in &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; (Vol. 2) #1. He has apparently fulfilled the prophecy made by Hyperion in &quot;Ultimate Power&quot; #9.

Fury returns to the Ultimate Universe in &quot;Ultimatum&quot; #4 and is instrumental in defeating Magneto. Jean Grey telepathically relays the information discovered by Fury in &quot;Ultimate Origins&quot; that mutants are not the next stage in human evolution, but are in fact the result of experimentation done by humans. This revelation causes Magneto to reverse the damage done to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles.

Following the events of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Fury is informed by Hawkeye about how Captain America discovered the secret of the Red Skull. Fury asks head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Carol Danvers for permission to start up a &quot;death squad&quot; in order to catch the Red Skull and Cap, which he then carries out with the help of Hawkeye, Dr. Gregory Stark, and the rest of the Ultimate Avengers.

In &quot;Ultimate Comics: Avengers&quot; Fury returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. again. After learning that Captain America went rogue after discovering that the Red Skull was his biological son, Fury reactivated &quot;Project Avenger&quot; and recruited a team of questionable super humans to find Captain America. Following Captain America&#x27;s capture, Fury briefed the Avengers of AIM&#x27;s purpose of creating the Cosmic Cube to build their visioned utopia and readied his team to thwart the organization&#x27;s plans.

Fury guided his team of Avengers from headquarters, with the secret intent to go ahead with &quot;plan B&quot;, which is to detonate a nuclear warhead that was built into War Machine&#x27;s armor by Gregory Stark in case the mission failed.

Captain America managed to arrive at the location of the battle between the Red Skull and the Avengers and teleported the jet to the exact location where the Red Skull was standing, impaling him through the chest with one of the rods that protrudes from its nose. The Red Skull was taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for Gail, his mother, to say her goodbyes. Red Skull explained to Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was turn back time and prevent Steve Rogers from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life, rather than the one he was given. Petra Laskov, dressed as a doctor, then entered the room and shot Red Skull in the head, killing him.

A short time later, Fury is fixing his damaged prosthetic arm while speaking with Gregory Stark. Gregory concludes that it was in fact Fury himself who hired the Red Skull to come out of retirement, in some sort of plot to resurrect Project Avengers, securing him a position in S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s employment and eventually regaining his old title as Director. Fury told him that was how he got the job the first time, and expects the same outcome this time as well. Fury and his Avengers later faced threats from the Ghost Rider and a vampiric menace. In &quot;Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates&quot;, Stark would end up framing Fury for selling information to North Korea and stealing his position as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director and charging Fury&#x27;s ex-assistant Carol Danvers&#x27; New Ultimates to apprehend him, ending in a standstill when Stark caught Fury, revealing he was manipulating both. Fury and his Avengers take down Stark&#x27;s forces with Thor landing a strike from his hammer, killing Gregory.

In &quot;Ultimate Enemy&quot;, approximately six months after Ultimatum, Fury is black ops and is &quot;off the grid&quot;. He was enjoying a meal while under cover when the restaurant he was at was attacked by a creature with energy powers. Fury manages to hold the creature at bay until Spider-Man and Human Torch arrive at the scene to investigate. The creature vanishes after a short battle with the three of them. Peter is surprised to see Fury alive, as he has not seen him for months.

Nick breaks into the Triskelion and confronts Carol Danvers in the ladies&#x27; room and points a gun to her head, exclaiming that she is the only person who knew he was alive and would have motive to have him killed. The two fight before being interrupted by a female S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, informing Danvers that an attack has been made in Queens, which Fury knows is where the Parker residence is located. Simultaneously, the two order a battalion of Hulkbuster agents to get to Queens to intercept the attacker, where they succeed in apprehending the monster attacking superhumans.

Attempting to atone for his mistakes with Peter, Fury has taken on a more direct mentor role for Miles Morales as the new Spider-Man.

When the Peter Parker of Earth-616 is sent to the Ultimate Universe, Fury interrogates him for information about his presence in this universe, accepting Peter&#x27;s story that he came from another universe as nobody would come up with something that insane as a lie. Peter also notes that Ultimate Nick Fury is a lot cooler than the version Peter knows. Attempting to atone for his mistakes with his Peter, Fury allows the other Peter to visit his counterpart&#x27;s family, and is satisfied when Peter gives Miles his blessing to become that world&#x27;s new Spider-Man.

Nick joined HYDRA using a bio-camouflage to change his appearance under the name of &quot;Scorpio&quot; (resembling his classic mainstream look), stating that his motivations were to destroy the government that took everything away from him, although he still had a different agenda apart from Hydra&#x27;s. The Ultimates managed to track him and tried to capture him, believing he was the traitor who provided Hydra with S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons. During an attack to Hydra&#x27;s Death&#x27;s Head camp, it was revealed Nick Fury was trying to destroy Hydra from the inside, while the S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor was actually Hydra leader Commander Crimson who used an Infinity Gem to battle her enemies, until a burst of energy made her disappear along with the artifact.

In the aftermath of the battle, Nick told Monica Chang he was planning to create his own team, the Howling Commandos, to battle Hydra the way the Ultimates couldn&#x27;t, along ex-Hydra agent Abigail Brand. Before leaving, Chang told Fury he would be under her supervision.

As the final Incursion of Earth-1610 and Earth-616 begins, the Maker (Reed Richards of Earth-1610) urges Fury to defend his world by attacking Earth-616. Despite not trusting the Maker, Fury sends every weapon and hero in his arsenal against the Marvel Universe&#x27;s heroes. His invasion fails against the might of the defending forces, but it buys time for the Maker to launch his doomsday weapon.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Nick Fury is depicted as the Director of H.A.N.D. (short for Heroic Anomaly Neutralization Directorate), implied to be a reorganized S.H.I.E.L.D after a takeover of The Hand. One year after the Maker&#x27;s imprisonment inside The City, Fury oversees the termination of a suspected &quot;terrorist&quot; named Keith Kincaid, who was merely a ordinary man with faint sympathies towards the Ultimates. He proceeds to meet with The Maker&#x27;s Council, his current superiors, giving reports of the current efforts to eliminate the current wave of super-dissidents. While internally composing his last confession, Fury recalls his early idealistic days during World War II, and the atrocities committed by him in the name of the Maker, such as the Inhuman Genocide, the murder of his friend Dum Dum Dugan, the killing of several heroes and the accident that caused Hank Pym&#x27;s brain damage, while perceiving some of his memories as &quot;blurry&quot;. When Fury decides to stop killing innocents, he activates the self-destruct override code on &quot;The Beast&quot;, H.A.N.D&#x27;s flag-ship Cumulo-Carrier, in order to take Council with him. This fails as it is revealed such events have happened before. After Emmanuel da Costa kills Fury, he&#x27;s shown to be only a Life Model Decoy as Emmanuel and Henri Duggary end up having to download new information into another Nick Fury LMD on Hulk&#x27;s orders, on the reasoning that the expandable nature of the Director position helps ward off potential traitors within H.A.N.D, while the fate of the original Fury is left unknown.

== Reception ==
In 2011, Fury was ranked 33rd in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot;, and 32nd in their list of &quot;The Top 50 Avengers&quot;.

<text>Åmmeberg is a locality situated in Askersund Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with 590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated at an estuary by a fjord of lake Vättern. It existed as early as the 12th century and had a mill owned by the convent in Riseberga. It was the regional centre of trade until the founding of Askersund.

The first Swedish female aviator, Elsa Andersson, died at age 24 outside Åmmeberg during a parachute jump 22 January 1922 (her third ever).

According to local tradition Queen Christina of Sweden was to confer upon Åmmeberg city privileges, but her carriage broke down in Askersund, and the queen who preferred not travel any further decided that Askersund was to have the city rights.

It was the port of the mining industry in Zinkgruvan, an industry started by a Belgian company Vieille Montagne 1857. The mine belongs to Lundin Mining since June 2004.

It is the summerhome of former Sweden&#x27;s ambassador to Switzerland, the novelist Jan Mårtenson, and has a small harbour and a seaside-golf course.

== Riksdag elections ==
Åmmeberg is forming an electoral ward with nearby Zinkgruvan. While historically the area has been left-wing with an industrial and mining heritage, this has gradually been eroded in the 21st century, with the electoral ward going to the right-leaning parties for the first time in 2018.

<doc id="528135" wikidata="Q2655890" url="?curid=528135" title="NKVD prisoner massacres">
<text>The NKVD prisoner massacres were a series of mass executions of political prisoners carried out by the NKVD, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union, across Eastern Europe, primarily in Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states and Bessarabia. After the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, NKVD troops were supposed to evacuate political prisoners to the interior of the Soviet Union, but the hasty retreat of the Red Army, a lack of transportation and other supplies, and general disregard for legal procedures often led to prisoners being simply executed.

Estimates of the death toll vary by location; nearly 9,000 in the Ukrainian SSR, 20,000–30,000 in eastern Poland (now part of Western Ukraine), with the total number reaching approximately 100,000 extrajudicial executions in the span of a few weeks.

==Background==

Operation Barbarossa surprised the NKVD, whose jails and prisons in territories annexed by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were crowded with political prisoners. In occupied eastern Poland, the NKVD was given responsibility for liquidating or evacuating over 140,000 prisoners (NKVD evacuation order No. 00803). In Ukraine and Western Belorussia, 60,000 people were forced to evacuate on foot. The official Soviet count had more than 9,800 reportedly executed in prisons, 1,443 executed in the process of evacuation, 59 killed for attempting to escape, 23 killed by German bombs and 1,057 deaths from other causes.

&quot;It was not only the numbers of the executed&quot;, wrote historian Yury Boshyk, who was quoted by Orest Subtelny, of the murders, &quot;but also the manner in which they died that shocked the populace. When the families of the arrested rushed to the prisons after the Soviet evacuation, they were aghast to find bodies so badly mutilated that many could not be identified. It was evident that many of the prisoners had also been tortured before death; others were killed en masse&quot;.

Approximately two thirds of the 150,000 prisoners were murdered; most of the rest were transported into the interior of the Soviet Union, but some were abandoned in the prisons if there was no time to execute them, and others managed to escape.

The NKVD killed prisoners in many places from Poland to Crimea. Immediately after the start of the German invasion, the NKVD started to execute large numbers of prisoners in most of their prisons, and it evacuated the remainder in death marches. Most of them were political prisoners, who were imprisoned and executed without a trial. The massacres were later documented by the occupying German authorities and were used in anti-Soviet and anti-Jewish propaganda. After the war and in recent years, the authorities of Germany, Poland, Belarus, and Israel identified no fewer than 25 prisons whose prisoners were killed and a much larger number of mass execution sites.

===Belarus===
* Berezwecz-Taklinovo Death Road in Berezwecz (present-day part of Hlybokaye): on the night of June 23–24 the NKVD executed at least several dozen inmates. The next day, the remaining prisoners were rushed towards Vitebsk. During the 120-kilometer march, they died en masse due to exhaustion, hunger and thirst, as well as at the hands of the guards. The last stop on the &#x27;road of death&#x27; was the Taklinovo kolkhoz (present-day Mikalajeva), where on June 28, the Soviets executed almost all the prisoners. Approximately 1-2 thousand people were murdered in the evacuation of the prison in Berezwecz.
* Chervyen massacre near Minsk: in late June, the NKVD started evacuating all prisons in Minsk. Between June 24 and June 27, at least 1,000 people were killed in Chervyen and in the death marches.
* Hrodna (Grodno in pre-war Poland): on June 22, 1941, the NKVD executed several dozen people at the local prison. Execution of the remaining 1,700 prisoners was not possible due to the advance of the German army and hurried retreat of the NKVD executioners.
* Vileyka-Barysaw Death Road: on June 24, 1941, the NKVD executed at least 28 prisoners held in Vileyka (Wilejka in pre-war Poland). Remaining prisoners, over 1,000 men and women, were forcibly marched eastward towards Barysaw. During the march, an estimated 500 to 800 prisoners died at the hands of guards.
* Valozhyn-Tarasovo Death Road: in late June, the NKVD evacuated prisoners from Valozhyn (Wołożyn in pre-war Poland). After marching on foot for two days, approximately 100 prisoners were executed by the NKVD near the village of Tarasovo.

===Estonia===

* Tartu massacre: on July 9, 1941, 193 detainees were shot in Tartu prison.

===Lithuania===
* Vilnius (Wilno in pre-war Poland): after the German invasion, the NKVD murdered a large number of prisoners of the infamous Lukiškės Prison.
* Rainiai massacre near Telšiai: up to 79 political prisoners were killed on June 24 and 25.
* Pravieniškės prison near Kaunas: in June 1941, the NKVD murdered 260 political prisoners and all Lithuanian personnel in the prison.
* Lithuanian prisoners were evacuated to Belarus and some of them were murdered, e.g., in the Chervyen massacre and near Bigosovo.

===Poland===
By 1941, much of the ethnically Polish population living under Soviet rule in the eastern half of Poland had already been deported to remote areas of the USSR. Others, including a large number of Polish civilians of other ethnicities (mostly Belarusians and Ukrainians), were held in provisional prisons in the region, where they awaited deportation either to NKVD prisons in Moscow or to the Gulag. It is estimated that out of 13 million people living in eastern Poland, roughly half a million were jailed, and more than 90% of those were men. Thus approximately 10% of adult males were imprisoned at the time of the German offensive. Many died in prisons from torture or neglect. Methods of torture included scalding victims and cutting off their ears, noses and fingers. Timothy Snyder estimates that the NKVD shot some 9,817 imprisoned Polish citizens following the German invasion of the USSR in 1941.
* NKVD massacre sites in pre-war Poland are now in Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.

===Ukraine===

In Soviet-occupied western Ukraine, under the threat of German invasion NKVD committed various mass murders of prison inmates, including:
* Berezhany massacre (Brzeżany in pre-war Poland): between June 26 and 30 June 1941 the crew of the NKVD prison executed from 174 to 300 Polish citizens. Among them were many Ukrainians.
* Chortkiv (Czortków in pre-war Poland): in the last days of June 1941 the Soviets executed an estimated 100 to 200 prisoners held in the local prison. The remaining prisoners were evacuated further east, either by train or on foot, while hundreds died due to the inhumane conditions of transport or at the hands of guards. At the end of July 1941, 767 prisoners evacuated from Chortkiv were executed by Soviets in Uman (the Evacuation of Chortkiv Prison).
* Donetsk Rutchenkovo Field
* Dubno massacre (in pre-war Poland): between 23 and 25 June 1941, the Soviets executed an estimated 500 to 550 prisoners held in the Dubno prison. Only a few individuals survived the massacre.
* Ivano-Frankivsk (Stanisławów in pre-war Poland): Over 500 Polish prisoners (including 150 women and dozens of children) were shot by the NKVD and buried in several mass graves at Dem&#x27;ianiv Laz.
* Kharkiv tragedy: 1,200 prisoners were burned alive.
* Lutsk massacre (Łuck in pre-war Poland): After the prison was hit by German bombs, Soviet authorities promised amnesty to all political prisoners to prevent escapes. As they lined up outside they were machine-gunned by Soviet tanks. They were told: &quot;Those still alive get up.&quot; Some 370 stood up and were forced to bury the dead, after which they were murdered as well. The Nazi foreign ministry claimed 1,500 Ukrainians were killed while the SS and Nazi military intelligence claimed 4,000.
* Lviv (Lwów in pre-war Poland, Executions in Lviv (June 1941)): the massacres in this city began immediately after the German attack, on June 22, and continued until June 28. The NKVD executed several thousand inmates in a number of provisional prisons. Among the most common methods of extermination were shooting prisoners in their cells, throwing grenades into the cells or starving them to death in the cellars. Some were simply bayoneted to death. It is estimated that over 4000 people were murdered that way, while the number of survivors is estimated at 270. A Ukrainian uprising briefly forced the NKVD to retreat, but it soon returned to kill the remaining prisoners in their cells. In the aftermath, medical students described the scene at one of the prisons:
&quot;From the courtyard, doors led to a large space, filled from top to bottom with corpses...Among them were many women. On the left wall, three men were crucified, barely covered by clothing from their shoulders, with severed male organs. Underneath them on the floor in half-sitting, leaning positions – two nuns with those organs in their mouths...most were stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet. Some were naked or almost naked, others in decent street clothes. One man was in a tie, mostly likely just arrested.&quot;These massacres were followed by the Lviv pogroms, committed by the German military and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists after the German takeover of the city. Jewish residents of the city were targeted by German soldiers, OUN members, and local citizens. In some instances, the pogroms and violence against Jewish residents was framed as justified revenge for the murders committed by the NKVD.
* Sambir massacre (Sambor in pre-war Poland): in the last days of June 1941 the Soviets executed an estimated 500 to 700 prisoners in the Sambir prison. During the latter stage of the massacre, some prisoners actively resisted, which resulted in saving their lives.
* Simferopol: on October 31, the NKVD shot a number of people in the NKVD building and the city prison.
* Yalta: on November 4, the NKVD shot all the prisoners in the city prisons.
* Zolochiv massacre (Złoczów in pre-war Poland): in the last days of June 1941 the Soviets executed all inmates at Zolochiv prison, an estimated 650 to 720 individuals.

Soviet statistics for 78 Ukrainian prisons:
* evacuated 45,569 
* killed inside the prisons 8,789
* killed runaways 48 
* killed &quot;legally&quot; 123
* killed &quot;illegally&quot; 55
* left alive 3,536

===Russia===
* Oryol: In September 1941, over 150 political prisoners (among them Christian Rakovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Olga Kameneva, and Dmitri Pletnyov) were executed in Medvedevsky Forest near Oryol.
* Kuybyshev: On 28 October 1941, 20 high ranking ex-Red Army officers and party officials were shot without trial in the village of Barbysh, Kuybyshev.

<text>A Perl module is a discrete component of software for the Perl programming language. Technically, it is a particular set of conventions for using Perl&#x27;s package mechanism that has become universally adopted.
A module defines its source code to be in a &quot;package&quot; (much like a Java package), the Perl mechanism for defining namespaces, e.g. &quot;CGI&quot; or &quot;Net::FTP&quot; or &quot;XML::Parser&quot;; the file structure mirrors the namespace structure (e.g. the source code for &quot;Net::FTP&quot; is in &quot;Net/FTP.pm&quot;). Furthermore, a module is the Perl equivalent of the class when object-oriented programming is employed.

A collection of modules, with accompanying documentation, build scripts, and usually a test suite, composes a distribution. The Perl community has a sizable library of distributions available for search and download via CPAN.

Perl is a language allowing many different styles of programming. A developer is as likely to find a module written in a procedural style (for example, Test::Simple) as object-oriented (e.g. XML::Parser), both are considered equally valid according to what the module needs to do. Modules might also be used to mixin methods (DBIx::Class) or be a pragma (strict.pm) which has an effect immediately upon being loaded. Modules can even be used to alter the syntax of the language. The effect of Perl modules are usually limited to the current scope in which it was loaded.

It is common for Perl modules to have embedded documentation in Perl&#x27;s Plain Old Documentation format. POD imposes little structure on the author. It is flexible enough to be used to write articles, web pages and even entire books such as Programming Perl. Contrast with javadoc which is specialized to documenting Java classes. By convention, module documentation typically follows the structure of a Unix man page.

The language of Perl is defined by the single implementation (referred to as &quot;perl&quot;) and is added to (and in rare occasions taken away from) each new release. For this reason it is important for a module author to be aware what features they&#x27;re making use of and what the minimum required version of perl is. The code on this page requires perl 5.6.0 which is considered rather old by now.

== Examples ==

What follows are examples of &quot;Hello, World&quot; implemented in different styles of modules. It must be understood that a module is not necessary in Perl; functions and code can be defined and used anywhere. This is just for example purposes. Contrast with Java where a class is always necessary. A real &quot;Hello, World&quot; function would be written like so:

sub hello { &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot; }
print hello();

or simply printed in one line:

print &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
===Procedural example===
Here is &quot;Hello, World&quot; implemented as a procedural module with a customizable target for the greeting, just to make things interesting. Also included is a short script to illustrate the module&#x27;s use.

====&quot;hello_world.pl&quot;====
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Loads the module and imports any functions into our namespace 
# (defaults to &quot;main&quot;) exported by the module. Hello::World exports
# hello() by default. Exports can usually be controlled by the caller.
use Hello::World;

print hello(); # prints &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;
print hello(&quot;Milky Way&quot;); # prints &quot;Hello, Milky Way!\n&quot;
====&quot;Hello/World.pm&quot;====

# &quot;package&quot; is the namespace where the module&#x27;s functionality/data resides. 
# It dictates the name of the file if you want it to be &quot;use&quot;d.
# If more than one word, it constrains the location of the module.

package Hello::World;

# By default Perl allows you to use variables without declaring 
# them. This may be convenient for short scripts and one-liners.
# But in a longer unit of code such as a module it is wise to declare 
# your variables both to catch typos and to constrain their 
# accessibility appropriately from outside the module. The strict pragma
# forces you to declare your variables.
use strict;
# Similarly, Perl does not issue most compiler or run-time warnings by default.
# More complicated scripts, such as most modules, will usually find them very 
# helpful for debugging. The warnings pragma turns on optional warnings.
use warnings;
# A module&#x27;s version number is stored in $ModuleName::VERSION; certain 
# forms of the &quot;use&quot; built-in depend on this variable being defined.

our $VERSION = &#x27;1.00&#x27;;

# Inherit from the &quot;Exporter&quot; module which handles exporting functions.
# Most procedural modules make use of this.

use base &#x27;Exporter&#x27;;

# When the module is invoked, export, by default, the function &quot;hello&quot; into 
# the namespace of the using code.

our @EXPORT = qw(hello);

# Lines starting with an equal sign indicate embedded POD 
# documentation. POD sections end with an =cut directive, and can 
# be intermixed almost freely with normal code.

=head1 NAME

Hello::World - An encapsulation of a common output message

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Hello::World;
 print hello();
 print hello(&quot;Milky Way&quot;);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a procedural module which gives you the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
message, and it’s even customizable!

=head2 Functions

The following functions are exported by default

=head3 hello

 print hello();
 print hello($target);

Returns the famous greeting. If a C&lt;$target&gt; is given it will be used,
otherwise &quot;world&quot; is the target of your greeting.

=cut

# define the function hello().

sub hello {
 my $target = shift;
 $target = &#x27;world&#x27; unless defined $target;
 return &quot;Hello, $target!\n&quot;;

=head1 AUTHOR

Joe Hacker &lt;joe@joehacker.org&gt;

=cut

# A Perl module must end with a true value or else it is considered not to
# have loaded. By convention this value is usually 1 though it can be
# any true value. A module can end with false to indicate failure but
# this is rarely used and it would instead die() (exit with an error).
1;

Since Hello/World.pm is not in your @INC path, you must specify . on the command line to run the above example:

perl -I. hello_world.pl

===Object-oriented example===
Here&#x27;s an example of the same thing done in an object-oriented
style. The advantage of an OO module is that each object can be configured
independently from other objects.

====&quot;hello_world.pl&quot;====

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Hello::World;
my $hello = Hello::World-&gt;new;

==Perl packages and namespaces==
A running Perl program has a built-in namespace called &quot;codice_1&quot;, which is the default name. For example, a subroutine called codice_2 can be called as codice_3 or codice_4. With a variable the appropriate sigil is placed in front of the namespace; so a scalar variable called codice_5 can also be referred to as codice_6, or even codice_7. Other namespaces can be created at any time.

package Namespace1;
$var1 = 1; # created in namespace Namespace1, which is also created if not pre-existing
our $var2 = 2; # also created in that namespace; our required if use strict is applied
my $var3 = 3; # lexically-scoped my-declared - NOT in any namespace, not even main

$Namespace2::var1 = 10; # created in namespace Namespace2, also created if not pre-existing
our $Namespace2::var2 = 20; # also created in that namespace
my $Namespace2::var3 = 30;#compilation error:my-declared variables CAN&#x27;T belong to a package
Package declarations apply package scope till the next package declaration or the end of the block in which the declaration is made.

our $mainVar = &#x27;a&#x27;;
package Sp1;
our $sp1aVar = &#x27;aa&#x27;;
print &quot;$main::mainVar\t$sp1aVar\n&quot;; # note mainVar needs qualifying
package Sp2;
our $sp2aVar = &#x27;aaa&#x27;;
print &quot;$main::mainVar\t$Sp1::sp1aVar\t$sp2aVar\n&quot;;# note mainVar and sp1aVar need qualifying
package main;
print &quot;$mainVar\t$Sp1::sp1aVar\t$Sp2::sp2aVar\n&quot;; # note sp1aVar and sp2aVar need qualifying

$mainVar = &#x27;b&#x27;;
 # NOTE previously created packages and package variables still accessible
 package Sp1;
 our $sp1bVar = &#x27;bb&#x27;;
 print &quot;$main::mainVar\t$sp1aVar\t$sp1bVar\n&quot;; # note mainVar needs qualifying
 package Sp2;
 our $sp2bVar = &#x27;bbb&#x27;;
 print &quot;$main::mainVar\t$Sp1::sp1aVar$Sp1::sp1bVar\t$sp2aVar$sp2bVar\n&quot;;
 } # note mainVar and sp1...Var need qualifying
 print &quot;$main::mainVar\t$sp1bVar$sp1aVar\t$Sp2::sp2bVar$Sp2::sp2aVar\n&quot;;
} # note package Sp1 applies by default
# main applies again by default; all package variables still accessible as long as qualified
print &quot;$mainVar\t$Sp1::sp1aVar$Sp2::sp2bVar\n&quot;;
===Packages and modules===
Conventionally, namespaces are associated with modules; in practice, there is usually one namespace per module and vice versa, but that&#x27;s not mandated by the language. For example, the &#x27;standard&#x27; module CGI.pm has the following declaration at its top:

package CGI;

This module, and its functionality, would commonly be invoked as follows:

use CGI (&#x27;:standard&#x27;); # imports many functions, including b()
print b(&#x27;Hello, world&#x27;); # outputs &lt;b&gt;Hello, world&lt;/b&gt;

A &#x27;missing&#x27; subroutine &quot;could&quot; be added from the using program&#x27;s namespace.

sub CGI::bi { # define target namespace (CGI) and sub name (bi)
 return b(i($_[0]));

and invoked as below:

print CGI::bi(&#x27;Hello, world&#x27;); # outputs &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hello, world&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

However, though technically feasible, that would be dubious programming practice. You might just as well define the sub in the calling namespace, and call it from that namespace.

<doc id="528144" wikidata="Q5864" url="?curid=528144" title="G-type main-sequence star">
<text>A G-type main-sequence star (spectral type: G-V), also often, and imprecisely, called a yellow dwarf, or G star, is a main-sequence star (luminosity class V) of spectral type G. Such a star has about 0.9 to 1.1 solar masses and an effective temperature between about . Like other main-sequence stars, a G-type main-sequence star converts the element hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion. The Sun, the star in the center of the Solar System to which the Earth is gravitationally bound, is an example of a G-type main-sequence star (G2V type). Each second, the Sun fuses approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium in a process known as the proton–proton chain (4 hydrogens form 1 helium), converting about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Besides the Sun, other well-known examples of G-type main-sequence stars include Alpha Centauri, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.

==Description==
The term &quot;yellow dwarf&quot; is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellowish for less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. The Sun is in fact white, but it can often appear yellow, orange or red through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere due to atmospheric Rayleigh scattering, especially at sunrise and sunset. In addition, although the term &quot;dwarf&quot; is used to contrast G-type main-sequence stars with giant stars or bigger, stars similar to the Sun still outshine 90% of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely much dimmer orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs which are much more common, the latter being stellar remnants).

A G-type main-sequence star with the mass of the Sun will fuse hydrogen for approximately 10 billion years, until the hydrogen element is exhausted at the center of the star. When this happens, the star rapidly expands, cooling and darkening as it passes through the subgiant branch and ultimately expanding into many times its previous size at the tip of the red giant phase, about 1 billion years after leaving the main sequence. After this, the star&#x27;s degenerate helium core abruptly ignites in a helium flash fusing helium, and the star passes on to the horizontal branch, and then to the asymptotic giant branch. Expanding even further as helium starts running out as it pulses violently, the star&#x27;s gravity is not sufficient to hold its outer envelope, resulting in significant mass loss and shedding. The ejected material remains as a planetary nebula, radiating as it absorbs energetic photons from the photosphere. Eventually, the core begins to fade as nuclear reactions cease, and becomes a dense, compact white dwarf, which cools slowly from its high initial temperature as the nebula fades.

==Spectral standard stars==
The revised Yerkes Atlas system (Johnson &amp; Morgan 1953) listed 11 G-type dwarf spectral standard stars; however, not all of these still exactly conform to this designation.

The &quot;anchor points&quot; of the MK spectral classification system among the G-type main-sequence dwarf stars, i.e. those standard stars that have remained unchanged over years, are Chara (G0V), the Sun (G2V), Kappa1 Ceti (G5V), 61 Ursae Majoris (G8V). Other primary MK standard stars include HD 115043 (G1V) and 16 Cygni B (G3V). The choices of G4 and G6 dwarf standards have changed slightly over the years among expert classifiers, but often-used examples include 70 Virginis (G4V) and 82 Eridani (G6V). There are not yet any generally agreed upon G7V and G9V standards.

== Habitability ==

G-type main sequence stars can provide habitability for life to develop, such as the Sun with life on Earth. They also live long enough to give life enough time to develop, between 7.9 and 13 billion years. Our Sun’s lifetime is about 10 billion years.

==Planets==
Besides the Sun and its planets, some of the nearest G-type stars known to have planets include 61 Virginis, HD 102365, HD 147513, Chalawan, Cervantes and Tau Ceti.

<doc id="528146" wikidata="Q652062" url="?curid=528146" title="Constitution of Russia">
<text>The Constitution of the Russian Federation () was adopted by national referendum on 12 December 1993 and enacted on 25 December 1993. The latest significant reform occurred in 2020, marked by extensive amendments that altered various sections, including presidential terms, social policies, and the role of Russian law over international ones. (See 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia).

Russia&#x27;s constitution came into force on 25 December 1993, at the moment of its official publication, and abolished the Soviet system of government. The 1993 Constitution is one of the longest-standing constitutions in Russian history, second only to the Soviet Union’s 1936 Constitution, which was in effect until 1977.

The text was drafted by the 1993 Constitutional Conference, which was attended by over 800 participants. Sergei Alexeyev, Sergey Shakhray, and sometimes Anatoly Sobchak are considered as the primary co-authors of the constitution. The text was inspired by Mikhail Speransky&#x27;s constitutional project and the current French constitution. The USAID-funded lawyers also contributed to the development of the draft. 

It replaced the previous Soviet-era Constitution of 12 April 1978, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (which had already been amended in April 1992 to reflect the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the sovereignty of the Russian Federation), following the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis.

==Structure==
The constitution is divided into two sections. Overall it creates a system of crown-presidentialism (see Partlett 2022 for details), which affords vast power to the office of the president to dominate executive, legislative, and judicial power. 

===Preamble===
We, the multinational people of the Russian Federation, united by a common fate on our land, establishing human rights and freedoms, civic peace and accord, preserving the historically established state unity, proceeding from the universally recognized principles of equality and self-determination of peoples, revering the memory of ancestors who have conveyed to us the love for the Fatherland, belief in the good and justice, reviving the sovereign statehood of Russia and asserting the firmness of its democratic basic, striving to ensure the well-being and prosperity of Russia, proceeding from the responsibility for our Fatherland before the present and future generations, recognizing ourselves as part of the world community, adopt the Constitution of Russian Federation.

===Section One===
#The Fundamentals of the Constitutional System ()
#Rights and Freedoms of Man and Citizen ()
#The Federal Structure ()
#The President of the Russian Federation ()
#The Federal Assembly ()
#The Government of the Russian Federation ()
#Judicial Power and Procuracy ()
#Local Self-Government ()
#Constitutional Amendments and Review of the Constitution ()

===Section Two===
#Concluding and Transitional Provisions

==Provisions==
Especially on human rights and fundamental freedoms, the Constitution provides for human rights and freedoms of citizens according to the universally recognised principles and norms of international law as well as to their listing in the Constitution. (It affirms that the listing in the Constitution of the Russian Federation of the fundamental rights and freedoms shall not be interpreted as a rejection and derogation of other universally recognised human rights and freedoms.)

===Executive===

The Constitution of the Russian Federation specifies that the President is the Russian head of state, setting domestic and foreign policy and representing Russia both within the country and internationally [Article 80]. While the original constitution stipulated a four-year term and a maximum of two terms in succession, the current constitution decrees a six-year term. The four-year term was in effect while Vladimir Putin served his first and second terms; with the two-term limit, he was barred from the presidency in 2008. Instead, he served as Prime Minister while Dmitry Medvedev served as president for four years. Putin was re-elected to his third term in 2012; with the six-year term, he was elected to his fourth term in 2018. Article 81 specifies the method of election, including a secret ballot; Articles 82–93 detail powers, responsibilities, and limitations of the presidency. The constitution provides for a &quot;strong presidency&quot;; not only is the president the &quot;Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation&quot;, the president also has the power to dissolve the State Duma.

===Legislative branch===

The legislature is the Federal Assembly of Russia, which consists of two chambers: the State Duma (the lower house) and the Federation Council (the upper house). The two chambers possess different powers and responsibilities: the State Duma is of more significance, as it carries the main responsibility for passing federal laws. Although a bill may originate in either legislative chamber (or be submitted by the President, government, local legislatures, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, or High Arbitration Court), it must be first considered by the State Duma and be adopted by a majority vote before being turned over to the Federation Council, which has 14 days to take a vote on it. If the bill is adopted by the Federation Council, it must be signed by the President to become law. If rejected by the Federation Council, the bill will be returned to the State Duma, which can then override the council&#x27;s rejection by passing it again with a two-thirds vote in the same form. The President has a final veto, but the State Duma and Federation Council also have an overriding power by passing with a two-thirds vote. 

===Judiciary===
While the Russian Federation Constitution enumerates a strong and independent judicial branch, the reality is a question of debate. The constitution provides for judicial immunity, lifetime appointments/&quot;irremovable&quot; justices, the supremacy of the courts to administer justice, and affirms that judges need only submit to the constitution and the federal law. Additionally, Article 123 provides for open and fair trials, as well as equal application of the law. The Constitution originally delineated three main courts: the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and the Supreme Arbitration Court. However, the Supreme Arbitration Court was dissolved in 2014, and its jurisdiction was transferred to the Supreme Court. Judges for each court are appointed by the Federation Council, based on proposals made by the President of Russia. This appointment process includes formal vetting but remains subject to executive influence The Constitution requires 19 judges for the Constitution Court, but does not specify the number of justices for the other courts. As of 2002, the Supreme Court has 115 members; due to the expansion of duties in 2014, the number of seats was increased to 170. In September 2014, the Institute of Modern Russia reported that the Russian Federation&#x27;s Supreme Arbitration Court had been dissolved and that judicial matters previously under its authority had been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

==Amending the Constitution==
The procedure for amending the Constitution is outlined in Chapter Nine. Proposals on amendments to and revision of the provisions of the Constitution of the Russian Federation may be submitted by the President of the Russian Federation, the Council of Federation, the State Duma, the Government of the Russian Federation, legislative (representative) bodies of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, and by groups consisting of not less than one fifth of the members of the Council of Federation or of the deputies of the State Duma. 

Article 137 covers updating the provisions of Article 65 of the Constitution of Russia. An update regarding the change of the name of the subject of the Russian Federation is carried out by a decree of the President of Russia on bringing the name of the subject of the Russian Federation in the text of the Constitution of the Russian Federation in accordance with the decision of the subject of the Russian Federation. An update regarding changes in the subject composition of the Russian Federation is carried out in accordance with the federal constitutional law on the admission to the Russian Federation and the formation of a new constituent entity of the Russian Federation, on changes in the constitutional and legal status of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, which should contain an indication of the inclusion of relevant changes or additions to Article 65 of the Constitution of Russia.

Article 136 covers updating the provisions of chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Constitution of Russia. An update is carried out in the form of a special act: a law of the Russian Federation on amendments to the Constitution, which is adopted by the parliament similarly to the federal constitutional law, but then also requires ratification by the legislative bodies of the constituent entities of the Federation. Moreover, one law of the Russian Federation on the amendment to the Constitution covers interrelated changes to the constitutional text; the law itself receives a name reflecting the essence of this amendment.

Article 135 covers updating the provisions of chapters 1, 2, and 9 of the Constitution of Russia. An update to any of these chapters is considered a revision of the Constitution&#x27;s fundamental provisions, which is possible only through the adoption of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation by the Russian Constitutional Assembly or by popular vote.

=== 2008 amendments ===

The amendments of 2008, which were proposed in November 2008 and came into force on 31 December 2008, are the first substantial amendments to the Constitution of Russia of 1993 and extended the terms of the President of Russia and the State Duma from four to six and five years, respectively. Earlier only minor adjustments concerning the naming of the federal subjects or their merging were made, which require a much simpler procedure.

=== February 2014 amendments ===
=== July 2014 amendments ===

On 21 March 2014, Federal Constitutional Law No. 6 «On the Adoption of the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and the Formation of New Subjects within the Russian Federation - the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol» was adopted.

=== 2020 amendments ===

The amendments of 2020 remove the &quot;in a row&quot; clause from the article regulating the maximum number of presidential terms, discounting previous presidential terms before the amendment enters into force. Other changes are recognition of Russia as a successor to the Soviet Union in relation to international organizations, treaties, and assets of the USSR stipulated by international treaties outside the territory of the Russian Federation, banning ceding Russian territory, diminishing the accomplishments by the &quot;defenders of the fatherland&quot; and their role in World War II is no longer allowed, and enshrining God and heterosexual marriage in the constitution. Other amendments would enshrine the role of the Russian language as that of &quot;state forming people&quot;, a constitutional reference to God and giving statutory backing to the State Council. 

From 25 June to 1 July 2020, a nationwide vote took place, with 78% of voters voting in favor of the amendments with a turnout of 65%, according to official results.

Putin signed an executive order on 3 July 2020 to officially insert the amendments into the Russian Constitution; they took effect on 4 July 2020.

=== 2022 annexations ===
After the signing of &quot;treaties of annexation&quot; with Russian occupation authorities during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the text of the constitution was updated to include the Donetsk People’s Republic, Kherson Oblast, Luhansk People’s Republic, and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. As of December 2022, none of these territories is fully controlled by Russian forces, and Russian law does not define their borders: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia will &quot;continue consultations with the residents&quot; as to the oblast borders, and that the people’s republics are annexed &quot;in the 2014 borders&quot;, but high-level Russian collaborator Oleg Tsariov stated that &quot;there are no 2014 borders&quot;.

==Differences between the Constitution and the laws==
The Constitution of Russia:

* defines the state system, basic rights and freedoms, the form of the state and the system of supreme state authorities
* has the highest legal force
* has direct effect (the provisions of the constitution must be implemented regardless of whether other acts contradict them)
* is characterized by stability due to a special, complicated order of acceptance and change
* is the basis for the current legislation.

==Numismatics==
On December 10, 2018, a commemorative coin made of copper-nickel alloy with a nominal value of 25 rubles &quot;The 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of the Russian Federation&quot; was issued. On the reverse of the coin there is a relief image of an open book with a drawing of the coat of arms of the Russian Federation on the left page and the inscription &quot;КОНСТИТУЦИЯ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ&quot; on the right page. The commemorative coin was issued in a circulation of 1,000,000 and is a legal means of cash payment in the territory of the Russian Federation.

<text>In electronics, a common collector amplifier (also known as an emitter follower) is one of three basic single-stage bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier topologies, typically used as a voltage buffer.

In this circuit, the base terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the emitter is the output, and the collector is &quot;common&quot; to both (for example, it may be tied to ground reference or a power supply rail), hence its name. The analogous field-effect transistor circuit is the common drain amplifier and the analogous tube circuit is the cathode follower.

== Basic circuit ==

The circuit can be explained by viewing the transistor as being under the control of negative feedback. From this viewpoint, a common-collector stage (Fig. 1) is an amplifier with full series negative feedback. In this configuration (Fig. 2 with β = 1), the entire output voltage &quot;V&quot;out is placed contrary and in series with the input voltage &quot;V&quot;in. Thus the two voltages are subtracted according to Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law (KVL) (the subtractor from the function block diagram is implemented just by the input loop), and their difference &quot;V&quot;diff = &quot;V&quot;in − &quot;V&quot;out is applied to the base–emitter junction. The transistor continuously monitors &quot;V&quot;diff and adjusts its emitter voltage to equal &quot;V&quot;in minus the mostly constant &quot;V&quot;BE (approximately one diode forward voltage drop) by passing the collector current through the emitter resistor RE. As a result, the output voltage &quot;follows&quot; the input voltage variations from &quot;V&quot;BE up to &quot;V&quot;+; hence the name &quot;emitter follower&quot;.

Intuitively, this behavior can be also understood by realizing that &quot;V&quot;BE is very insensitive to bias changes, so any change in base voltage is transmitted (to good approximation) directly to the emitter. It depends slightly on various disturbances (transistor tolerances, temperature variations, load resistance, a collector resistor if it is added, etc.), since the transistor reacts to these disturbances and restores the equilibrium. It never saturates even if the input voltage reaches the positive rail.

The common-collector circuit can be shown mathematically to have a voltage gain of almost unity:
: formula_1

A small voltage change on the input terminal will be replicated at the output (depending slightly on the transistor&#x27;s gain and the value of the load resistance; see gain formula below). This circuit is useful because it has a large input impedance
: formula_2
so it will not load down the previous circuit, and a small output impedance
: formula_3
so it can drive low-resistance loads.

Typically, the emitter resistor is significantly larger and can be removed from the equation:
: formula_4

== Applications ==
The common collector amplifier&#x27;s low output impedance allows a source with a large output impedance to drive a small load impedance without changing its voltage. Thus this circuit finds applications as a voltage buffer. In other words, the circuit has current gain (which depends largely on the &quot;h&quot;FE of the transistor) instead of voltage gain. A small change to the input current results in much larger change in the output current supplied to the output load.

One aspect of buffer action is transformation of impedances. For example, the Thévenin resistance of a combination of a voltage follower driven by a voltage source with high Thévenin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the voltage follower (a small resistance). That resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source. Conversely, a voltage follower inserted between a small load resistance and a driving stage presents a large load to the driving stage—an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a small load.

This configuration is commonly used in the output stages of class-B and class-AB amplifiers. The base circuit is modified to operate the transistor in class-B or AB mode. In class-A mode, sometimes an active current source is used instead of &quot;R&quot;E (Fig. 4) to improve linearity and/or efficiency.

== Characteristics ==
At low frequencies and using a simplified hybrid-pi model, the following small-signal characteristics can be derived. (Parameter formula_5 and the parallel lines indicate components in parallel.)

Where formula_6 is the Thévenin equivalent source resistance.

===Derivations===
Figure 5 shows a low-frequency hybrid-pi model for the circuit of Figure 3. Using Ohm&#x27;s law, various currents have been determined, and these results are shown on the diagram. Applying Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law at the emitter one finds:
: formula_7
Define the following resistance values:
: formula_8
Then collecting terms the voltage gain is found:
: formula_9
From this result, the gain approaches unity (as expected for a buffer amplifier) if the resistance ratio in the denominator is small. This ratio decreases with larger values of current gain β and with larger values of formula_10.
The input resistance is found as
: formula_11
The transistor output resistance formula_12 ordinarily is large compared to the load formula_13, and therefore formula_13 dominates formula_10. From this result, the input resistance of the amplifier is much larger than the output load resistance formula_13 for large current gain formula_17. That is, placing the amplifier between the load and the source presents a larger (high-resistive) load to the source than direct coupling to formula_13, which results in less signal attenuation in the source impedance formula_19 as a consequence of voltage division.

Figure 6 shows the small-signal circuit of Figure 5 with the input short-circuited and a test current placed at its output. The output resistance is found using this circuit as
: formula_20

Using Ohm&#x27;s law, various currents have been found, as indicated on the diagram. Collecting the terms for the base current, the base current is found as
: formula_21
where formula_10 is defined above. Using this value for base current, Ohm&#x27;s law provides
: formula_23
Substituting for the base current, and collecting terms,
: formula_24
where || denotes a parallel connection, and formula_25 is defined above. Because formula_25 generally is a small resistance when the current gain formula_17 is large, formula_25 dominates the output impedance, which therefore also is small. A small output impedance means that the series combination of the original voltage source and the voltage follower presents a Thévenin voltage source with a lower Thévenin resistance at its output node; that is, the combination of voltage source with voltage follower makes a more ideal voltage source than the original one.

<text>Pi Beta Phi (), often known simply as Pi Phi, is an international women&#x27;s fraternity founded at Monmouth College, in Monmouth, Illinois on April 28, 1867, as I. C. Sorosis, the first national secret college society of women to be modeled after the men&#x27;s Greek-letter fraternity.

Pi Phi&#x27;s headquarters are located in Town and Country, Missouri. Since its founding, the fraternity has installed over 200 chapters and more than 300 alumnae organizations across the United States and Canada. Most of the fraternity&#x27;s official philanthropies fall under the category of education/literacy programs or the preservation of traditional arts and crafts. Pi Beta Phi is one of 26 international sororities which are members under the umbrella organization of the National Panhellenic Conference.

==History==
Pi Beta Phi was founded as a secret organization under the name of I. C. Sorosis on at Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois. Pi Beta Phi is regarded as the first national women&#x27;s fraternity, although Kappa Alpha Theta was the first Greek-letter fraternity known among women in 1870. The founders were:
 The organization was formed &quot;to enjoy the benefits of a secret society similar to those formed by collegiate men.&quot; They planned their society at a home where two of the women rented a room, choosing I. C. Sorosis as the name and &quot;Pi Beta Phi&quot; as the motto.

Shortly after the founding, the sisters had a jeweler design their official badge: a golden arrow with the letters &quot;I. C.&quot; on the wings. When the name was changed to &quot;Pi Beta Phi,&quot; the Greek letters replaced &quot;I. C.&quot; on the wings. At the Yellowstone Convention of 1934, they voted to limit the links in the badge&#x27;s chain; there are 12, one for each of the founders.

The first fraternity convention was held in 1868 at the home of Fannie Thomson in Oquawka, Illinois. The fraternity&#x27;s second chapter was established that same year at Iowa Wesleyan University in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. The expansion made Pi Beta Phi the first national (multi-chapter) women&#x27;s secret society.

=== Name change and NPC membership ===
At the 1882 convention, the society officially adopted its motto as well as the fraternity colors of wine and silver blue. It began to use Greek letters as its name six years later in 1888, when the name was changed from I. C. Sorosis to Pi Beta Phi. In 1893, with the number of alumnae members growing, the fraternity organized a national alumnae department. Cooperation among women&#x27;s fraternities and sororities was formalized in 1902 with the founding of the National Panhellenic Conference, of which Pi Beta Phi was a founding member. Meanwhile, chapter expansion continued, and in 1908 the fraternity&#x27;s first Canadian chapter was established at the University of Toronto.

The fraternity&#x27;s first philanthropy, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, was organized in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in 1912. In 1913, the fraternity created local Alumnae Advisory Committees to support its chapters individually. Central Office, the fraternity headquarters, was established in 1925.

In the 1960s, G. William Domhoff, writing in &quot;Who Rules America?&quot;, listed Pi Beta Phi as one of &quot;the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.&quot;

==Symbols==

The official symbol of Pi Beta Phi is the arrow, and the official flower is the wine carnation. The fraternity colors are wine and silver blue. The unofficial mascot is the angel, nicknamed &quot;Angelica&quot;. Pi Beta Phi does not have an official gemstone.

The crest is a lozenge emblazoned with the crest of the Brownlee family, two of whom were founders of the fraternity. The badge (pin) is a golden arrow. The pledge pin is a golden arrowhead with the Greek letter Βeta.

The Kansas Alpha chapter began publication of &quot;The Arrow&quot; in 1885; it would eventually become a quarterly magazine published by the international fraternity for all its members. Today, dues-paying alumnae receive &quot;The Arrow&quot; by mail, while others receive it annually and can access it online at the fraternity&#x27;s web site year round.

== Chapters and alumnae clubs ==
Pi Beta Phi alumnae, initiated members in good standing who have graduated or otherwise left their college or university, can organize into local alumnae clubs which are recognized by the fraternity. Like collegiate chapters, alumnae clubs are grouped geographically into regions, which is led by an Alumnae Regional Director.

== Governance ==
The international fraternity is governed by a Grand Council, elected at each biennial convention and comprising a Grand President and six Grand Vice Presidents (Alumnae, Collegians, Finance/Housing, Community Relations, Fraternity Growth, and Member Experience). Also elected biennially are seven international Directors (Alumnae, Operations, Finance/Housing, Community Relations, Recruitment, Risk Management and Member Experience) and two Directors for each region (Collegiate Regional Director and Alumnae Regional Director). The work of Directors is supervised by a member of Grand Council.

In addition to the elected officers, there are several appointed international officers assigned certain functions, such as an archivist and a fraternity historian.

== Philanthropies ==
Like many sororities and fraternities, Pi Beta Phi members take part in a number of philanthropy programs. Over the fraternity&#x27;s history, philanthropies have included education, literacy, and the preservation of regional arts and crafts.

In 1990, Pi Beta Phi created the Pi Beta Phi Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.

=== Read &gt; Lead &gt; Achieve ===

Pi Phi&#x27;s philanthropy is called Read&gt;Lead&gt;Achieve and is centered around children&#x27;s literacy. Pi Phi&#x27;s believe in unlocking the power of reading to create a more literate and productive society. In order to do so, Pi Phi has started a reading enrichment program for students in pre school through third grade called, &quot;Champions are Readers&quot;. This program is funded through the Pi Beta Phi foundation and provides students with all materials needed for the program. Additionally, members can join a virtual book club to share their love of reading with their sisters.

===Educational and cultural philanthropies===
Pi Beta Phi opened the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in 1912 to provide education, economic opportunity, and health care to the rural area. Over the years, as the community took over childhood education, Settlement School began to adapt by offering arts and crafts classes in an effort to preserve and promote the region&#x27;s crafts tradition. An extension of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School called the Craft Work Shop was begun in 1945 in cooperation with the University of Tennessee. Now an independent nonprofit organization known as the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, it is one of the oldest arts and crafts centers in the South.

== Notable members ==
==Local chapter or member misconduct==
In 2005, the chapter at the University of California, Los Angeles was penalized for hazing pledges.

In 2010, the chapter at Cornell University received national attention after the release of a seven-page email sent to members of the chapter to address what is acceptable and unacceptable attire for recruitment. The tone of the e-mail—with lines such as &quot;No muffin tops or camel toe&quot; and &quot;I will not tolerate any gross plastic shizz [jewelry]&quot;—drew criticism from the Huffington Post and many online young adult forums.

In 2010, the chapter at the Miami University was suspended for one year after underage drinking, vomiting, littering, and damaging Lake Lyndsay Lodge in Hamilton, Ohio. In August 2017, the organization closed its chapter at Miami, saying that &quot;... the decision was made because the membership experience has routinely fallen below Fraternity expectations, particularly in regards to risk management and the lack of commitment to Pi Beta Phi&#x27;s core values.&quot;

In 2012, the chapter at Bucknell University was suspended for at least three years for violation of the international chapter&#x27;s policy and position statements regarding event planning-management and alcohol use. The chapter has since closed permanently.

In 2013, the chapter at the University of Nevada at Reno was banned from campus until the last active member graduated due to repeated hazing violations.

In 2013 and 2014, sorority women from multiple chapters at the University of Alabama – including Pi Beta Phi, Kappa Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, and Alpha Gamma Delta – alleged that either active members or some of their alumnae had prevented them from offering membership to black candidates because of their race. An anonymous Pi Beta Phi member told the university newspaper, &quot;The Crimson White&quot;, that alumnae threatened to cut financial support from the chapter if they offered membership to a black candidate the chapter had wanted to recruit. Students held a campus march to integrate Greek life on campus, and following media and national outcry, the university held a second round of recruitment in hopes of offering membership to more women, including black women.
In 2021, Emory University&#x27;s chapter faced allegations of racism and sexual assault cover-ups.

<text>The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary () colloquially Church of St. Mary () is a Brick Gothic church adjacent to the Main Market Square in Kraków, Poland. Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century and serve as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing 80 m (262 ft) tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss &quot;(Wit Stwosz)&quot;. Some of its monumental polychrome murals were designed by Poland&#x27;s leading history painter, Jan Matejko (1838–1893). In 1978 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Kraków.

On every hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, a trumpet signal—called the Hejnał mariacki—is played from the top of the taller of Saint Mary&#x27;s two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous 13th century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time &quot;hejnał&quot; is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by Polish Radio Jedynka.
Saint Mary&#x27;s Basilica also served as an architectural model for many of the churches that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly those like Saint Michael&#x27;s and Saint John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the Polish Cathedral style.

The church is familiar to many English-speaking readers from the 1928 book &quot;The Trumpeter of Krakow&quot; by Eric P. Kelly.

== History ==
According to chronicler Jan Długosz, Saint Mary&#x27;s Basilica in the Main Square in Kraków was founded in by the Bishop of Kraków, Iwo Odrowąż. The building was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Poland. Between 1290 and 1300 the new early Gothic church was built on the remaining foundations. It was consecrated twenty years later, in 1320.

The church was completely rebuilt during the reign of Casimir III the Great between 1355 and 1365 with substantial contributions from wealthy restaurateur Mikołaj Wierzynek. The presbytery was elongated and tall windows added. The main body of the church was completed in 1395–97 with the new vault constructed by master Nicholas Wernher from Prague. However, the vault over the presbytery collapsed in 1442 due to a possible earthquake, which has never happened before nor since in Kraków.

In the first half of the 15th century, the side chapels were added. Most of them were the work of master Franciszek Wiechoń. At the same time the northern tower was raised and designed to serve as the watch tower for the entire city. In 1478 carpenter Maciej Heringh (or Heringk) funded a helmet for the tower. A gilded crown was placed on it in 1666, which is still present today. At the end of the 15th century, Saint Mary&#x27;s church was enriched with a sculptural masterpiece, an Altarpiece of Veit Stoss (Ołtarz Mariacki Wita Stwosza) of late Gothic design.

In 1536/37, King Sigismund I. declared that the sermons in the church should be changed from German to Polish. The large German community of Kraków were relocating their place of worship to the smaller Saint Barbara&#x27;s church.

In the 18th century, by the decision of vicar Jacek Augustyn Łopacki, the interior was rebuilt in the late Baroque style. The author of this work was Francesco Placidi. All 26 altars, equipment, furniture, benches and paintings were replaced and the walls were decorated with polychrome, the work of Andrzej Radwański. In the years immediately before 1730 the Venetian painter Giambattista Pittoni painted five altarpieces for the side altars of the central nave: The Annunciation, The Adoration of the Magi, Madonna and Child with St. Philip Neri, Mary Magdalene, St. Sebastian.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the city decided that a cemetery near the basilica was to be shut down and replaced by a public square. Today, it is known as &quot;Plac Mariacki&quot; (Marian Square). In the years 1887–1891, under the direction of Tadeusz Stryjeński, the neo-Gothic design was introduced into the basilica. The temple gained a new design and murals painted and funded by Jan Matejko, who worked with Stanisław Wyspiański and Józef Mehoffer - the authors of stained glass in the presbytery.

In the 1990s, the church was renovated, ending with the replacement of the roof in 2003.

On 18 April 2010, in Saint Mary&#x27;s Basilica, a funeral ceremony for Polish president Lech Kaczyński and his wife Maria was held. The coffins were later transported and buried in one of the crypts of Wawel Cathedral.

<text>Brothers Keepers is a German-based transnational anti-racism project, bringing together hip hop, reggae and soul musicians, headed primarily by Afro-Germans. Their debut single, &quot;Adriano-Letzte Warnung&quot;, was written in response to the murder of Alberto Adriano by Neo-Nazis. It remains their most popular release, with more than 6 million views on YouTube.

==History==
The idea for the project took root when a German of Mozambiquan origin, named Alberto Adriano, was brutally killed by neo-Nazis in Dessau in 2000. A group of musicians decided to organize and fight back.

The following quote is about Adriano&#x27;s death and its effect.

Original: 

English: 

Brothers Keepers has local groups active in information campaigns, presenting teach-ins at schools etc. However the project primarily gained prominence in Germany through the collaborative album, &quot;Lightkultur&quot;. The title is a pun on conservative politician Günther Beckstein’s term &quot;deutsche Leitkultur&quot; (&quot;German leading culture&quot;), demanding that foreigners subject themselves to the supposed standards of German culture. The album features German musicians such as Torch, Samy Deluxe, Afrob, Denyo from the Beginner and D-Flame. The proceeds of this album went to charity.

==Politicization/Critique==
Brothers Keepers faced much criticism and disapproval despite being one of the first groups of Afro-German hip-hop artists that broke into the mainstream while addressing the struggles behind the Afro-German racial identity. On the one hand, the rappers are denounced for being &quot;too German.&quot; As described by Fatima El-Tayeb, &quot;Black Germans’ attempt to make their country their home by creating a space for themselves on its imaginary map – a step which, if successful, would mean a dramatic reconfiguration of ‘Germanness’ – is held against them by exactly those white Germans who most decry the nation&#x27;s anachronistic and exclusionary concept of identity.&quot; On the other hand, they are also criticized, mostly by white German liberals, for being too Black, racially exclusive, and anti-multicultural. They also received charges for perpetuating male dominance and masculinity that undermines the notable role that women and feminism asserted during the early stages of the Hip Hop movement. The main concern is that while they have made significant contributions to the protest against racial divides and essentialization for the Afro-German community in large, they might have done so in a way that fails to subvert gender stereotypes and is quite often offensive, if not hostile, towards women.

===Gender dynamics===
Brothers Keepers presented themselves and delivered their message in traditionally masculine ways. Their presentation was heavily influenced by the Black masculinity of mainstream American Hip-Hop, but maintained a distinctly Afro-German identity and spoke to Afro-German issues. Especially in lyrics and videos that were explicitly against Nazism and anti-Blackness in Germany, they formed a confrontational masculine collectivity. This was reaffirmed by their exclusion of women from their music and videos, an absence which they claimed was due to female performers being pregnant or on maternity leave. Some of the female performers in question, Sisters Keepers, contrasted with that masculinity with a rhetoric of peace and coalition-building rather than direct confrontation. In fact, in the music video for Sisters Keepers&#x27;s &quot;Liebe und Verstand,&quot; members of Brothers Keepers make visual and auditory cameos, giving the song a gendered authenticity. Although Brothers Keepers sought to reaffirm Afro-German identity with a masculinist perspective, it is important to note that the formation of the Afro-German identity was done largely by Afro-German women.

Black Lesbian feminist theorist and poet Audre Lorde can be identified as instrumental in facilitating contemporary articulations of Black Germanness. In 1984, Lorde visited Berlin and met with Black German women (such as Maya Ayim, Katharina Oguntoye, and Ika Hügel-Marshall) and coined the term &quot;Afro-German&quot;. Following the consolidation of terminology, a movement emerged led by the publication of &quot;Farbe bekennen&quot; (translated as &quot;Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out&quot;). Then, several organizations coalesced to critique the racism of the German feminist movement, including Initiative Schwarze Deutsche&quot; (ISD), and &quot;Afro-deutsche Frauen&quot; (ADEFRA). These organizations&#x27; early activities involved publishing magazines and organizing the first Black History Month celebrations in Berlin. They were foundational for community building along gendered and racialized lines in Germany and elsewhere, and they were pioneered by Afro-German women.

As hip-hop became means of forwarding Afro-German activism, Brother Keepers’ select historical consciousness demonstrates how &quot;the strong presence of women – articulate, feminist, often lesbian – in the first decades of the Afro-German struggle has been hard for young male MCs to stomach, given that they generally model themselves after images of black masculinity that are often deeply sexist and homophobic&quot;. In other words, &quot;By relegating female performers to the margins... Brothers Keepers runs counter to the strong presence of women and feminism in the history of Afro-German political organizing&quot;. Brother Keepers’ female counterpart, Sisters Keepers, emerged as an ostensible afterthought, and in their collaboration, Sisters Keepers were relinquished to the background as apolitical and demure sidekicks. This representation is a far cry from the true role Afro-German women have played in activism. Sisters Keepers later diverged from Brother Keepers, renaming themselves to &quot;Sisters&quot; and releasing the more radical record &quot;Gender Riots&quot; in 2008.

==Song lyrics==
The lyrics on the album are influenced by Black Power rhetoric and are militantly anti-Nazi, proposing solutions to racism ranging from education to violence. The militancy is especially well illustrated in the German Top 10 hit &quot;Adriano&quot;, a seven-minute &quot;tour de force&quot; produced by DJ Desue, featuring the &quot;crème&quot; of German rap. Its video shows a procession of rappers, marching as a united front and the chorus, sung by South African-descended R&amp;B star Xavier Naidoo, goes thus:

The project is not limited to Germany. It focuses on manifestations of the African diaspora throughout the world and is supported by international artists such as Jamaican reggae musician Ziggy Marley and Senegalese mbalax musician Youssou N&#x27;Dour. There is a UK Brothers Keepers, which, while lacking the organizational superstructure of its German counterpart, contributed a track to &quot;Lightkultur&quot;.

There is also a female version of this Movement/Band called the Sisters Keepers consisting of Nadja Benaissa, Ayọ, Kaye, Nicole Hadfield (), and Tamika, along with Tesiree, Lisa, Mamadee, Pat and Meli (, ) with Onejiru (Pielina Schindler).

<text>Wingsuit flying (or wingsuiting) is the sport of skydiving using a webbing-sleeved jumpsuit called a wingsuit to add webbed area to the diver&#x27;s body and generate increased lift, which allows extended air time by gliding flight rather than just free falling. The modern wingsuit, first developed in the late 1990s, uses a pair of fabric membranes stretched flat between the arms and flanks/thighs to imitate an airfoil, and often also between the legs to function as a tail and allow some aerial steering.

Like all skydiving disciplines, a wingsuit flight almost always ends by deploying a parachute, and so a wingsuit can be flown from any point that provides sufficient altitude for flight and parachute deployment – a drop aircraft, or BASE-jump exit point such as a tall cliff or mountain top. The wingsuit flier wears parachuting equipment specially designed for skydiving or BASE jumping. While the parachute flight is normal, the canopy pilot must unzip arm wings (after deployment) to be able to reach the steering parachute toggles and control the descent path.

Wingsuits are sometimes referred to as &quot;birdman suits&quot; (after the brand name of the makers of the first commercial wingsuit), &quot;squirrel suits&quot; (from their resemblance to flying squirrels&#x27; wing membrane), and &quot;bat suits&quot; (due to their resemblance to bat wings or perhaps the aptly named DC Comics superhero Batman and his signature costume).

==History==

An early attempt at wingsuit flying was made on 4 February 1912 by a 33-year-old tailor, Franz Reichelt, who jumped from the Eiffel Tower to test his invention of a combination of parachute and wing, which was similar to modern wingsuits. He misled the guards by saying that the experiment was going to be conducted with a dummy. He hesitated quite a long time before he jumped, and died when he hit the ground head first, opening a measurable hole in the frozen ground.

A wingsuit was first used in the US in 1930 by a 19-year-old American, Rex G Finney of Los Angeles, California. The goal was to increase horizontal movement and maneuverability during a parachute jump. These early wingsuits used materials such as canvas, wood, silk, steel, and whalebone. They were not very reliable, although some &quot;birdmen&quot;, such as Clem Sohn and Leo Valentin, claimed to have glided for miles.

Batwings, a precursor to wingsuits, were showcased in the 1969 film, &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot;, starring Burt Lancaster and Gene Hackman.

In the mid-1990s, the modern wingsuit was developed by Patrick de Gayardon of France, adapted from the model used by John Carta. In 1997, the Bulgarian Sammy Popov designed and built a wingsuit that had a larger wing between the legs and longer wings on the arms. He tested his prototype in a vertical wind tunnel in Las Vegas at Flyaway Las Vegas. Popov&#x27;s wingsuit first flew in October 1998, but never went into commercial production. In 1998, Chuck &quot;Da Kine&quot; Raggs built a version that incorporated hard ribs inside the wing airfoils. Although these more rigid wings were better able to keep their shape in flight, this made the wingsuit heavier and more difficult to fly. Raggs&#x27; design also never went into commercial production. Flying together for the first time, Popov and Raggs showcased their designs side by side at the World Free-fall Convention at Quincy, Illinois, in August 1999. Both designs performed well. At the same event, jumpers performed formation wingsuit skydives with de Gayardon&#x27;s, Popov&#x27;s, and Raggs&#x27; suits.
===Commercial era===
In 1999, Jari Kuosma of Finland and of Croatia teamed up to create a wingsuit that was safe and accessible to all skydivers. Kuosma established Bird-Man International Ltd. the same year. BirdMan&#x27;s &quot;Classic&quot;, designed by Pečnik, was the first wingsuit offered to the general skydiving public. BirdMan was the first manufacturer to develop an instructor program. Created by Kuosma, the instructor program&#x27;s aim was to remove the stigma that wingsuits were dangerous and to provide wingsuit beginners (generally, skydivers with a minimum of 200 jumps) with a way to safely enjoy what was once considered the most dangerous feat in the skydiving world. With the help of Birdman instructors Scott Campos, Chuck Blue, and Kim Griffin, a standardized program of instruction was developed that prepared instructors. Wingsuit manufacturers Squirrel Wingsuits, TonySuits Wingsuits, Phoenix-Fly, Fly Your Body, and Nitro Rigging have also instituted coach training programs.

==Technique==
===Launch===
A wingsuit pilot enters free fall wearing both a wingsuit and parachute equipment. The details of a wingsuit launch depend on whether it is a skydive from an aircraft or a BASE jump from a fixed object.

Exiting an aircraft in a wingsuit requires skills that differ depending on the location and size of the door. These techniques include the orientation relative to the aircraft and the airflow while exiting. It is also important that wingsuit pilots spread their legs and arms at the proper time to avoid hitting the tail or becoming unstable. The wingsuit immediately starts to fly upon exiting the aircraft in the relative wind generated by the forward speed of the aircraft.

Exiting from a BASE jumping site, such as a cliff, requires a different technique. In these situations, a vertical drop using the forces of gravity generates the airspeed that wingsuits need to generate lift. This is also the case when exiting from a helicopter, a paraglider, or a hot air balloon. Unlike when exiting an airplane, it takes time to build up airspeed to inflate the wingsuit and provide aerodynamic control. So exiting the cliff in a proper orientation is critical.

===Glide===
A wingsuit modifies the body area exposed to wind to increase the desired amount of lift and drag generated by the body. With training, wingsuit pilots can achieve sustained glide ratio of 3:1 or more. This means that for every meter dropped, three meters are gained moving forward. By adjusting the body configuration, fliers can alter both their forward speed and fall rate. The pilot manipulates these flight characteristics by changing the shape of the torso, de-arching and rolling the shoulders and moving hips and knees, and by changing the angle of attack in which the wingsuit flies in the relative wind, and by the amount of tension applied to the fabric wings of the suit. The absence of a vertical stabilizing surface results in little damping around the yaw axis, so poor flying technique can result in a spin that requires active effort on the part of the skydiver to stop.
A typical skydiver&#x27;s terminal velocity in belly to earth orientation ranges from 180 to 225 km/h (110 to 140 mph). A wingsuit can reduce these speeds dramatically. A vertical instantaneous velocity of 40 km/h (25 mph) has been recorded. However, the speed at which the body advances horizontally through the air is still much higher (up to 100 km/h [62 mph]).

The glide ratios of older wingsuits made in the 1990s through the early 2010s were closer to 2:1. It was possible for expert flyers to achieve a 3:1 ratio but this was very difficult. However, advancements in modern wingsuits allow flyers to achieve a 3:1 ratio much more easily, allowing for higher speeds.

=== Flare ===

Wingsuits can perform a flare in which airspeed is exchanged for additional lift. By first diving to build up speed, modern wingsuits can flare enough to gain altitude, but only for a short time.

=== Deployment ===

At a planned altitude above the ground in which a skydiver or BASE jumper typically deploys the parachute, wingsuit fliers will also deploy their parachutes. Before deployment, pilots adjust their flight configuration by flaring to reduce their air speed. The pilot then reaches back and throws a pilot chute to initiate the parachute deployment sequence. The parachute is flown to a controlled landing at the desired landing spot using typical skydiving or BASE jumping techniques.

=== Record-keeping ===
Wingsuit pilots often use tools including portable GPS receivers to record their flight path. This data can be analyzed later to evaluate flight performance in terms of fall rate, speed, and glide ratio. When jumping for the first time at a new location, BASE jumpers will often evaluate terrain using maps and laser range finders. By comparing a known terrain profile with previously recorded flight data, jumpers can objectively evaluate whether a particular jump is possible.
BASE jumpers also use landmarks, along with recorded video of their flight, to determine their performance relative to previous flights and the flights of other BASE jumpers at the same site.

== Suit design ==

Modern wingsuits use a combination of materials in order to create an airfoil shape. The main surface is typically made from ripstop nylon, with various materials used to reinforce the leading edge, and reduce drag.
* The tri-wing wingsuit has three individual ram-air wings attached under the arms and between the legs.
* The mono-wing wingsuit design incorporates the whole suit into one large wing.

Beginner wingsuits have less surface area and lower internal pressure. This makes them easier to control and less likely to go unstable in flight. Less fabric material makes it easier to deploy the pilot chute at the end of the flight. With experience, pilots can choose to upgrade to more advanced suits that have more surface area and increased glide performance.

The air foil shape is formed by pressure inside the wing and the construction of the suit. Internal ribs help form the shape. Having a smooth leading edge is especially important as it is the source of most lift and most drag. Reducing inlet drag while maintaining high internal suit pressure is also important in modern wingsuit design. The number of air inlets and their positions vary on different suit designs. Suits that are focused on freestyle flights often have inlets on the back surface of the suit to maintain internal pressure when pilots are &quot;back flying&quot; in a face-up orientation.

A 2010 redesign tested in a wind tunnel by the 8th Conference of the International Sports Engineering Association (ISEA) found that adding material to the wingsuit between the head/helmet area and connecting it to the wrist, thus increasing upper wings&#x27; size, would &quot;...lower lift-to-drag ratio in most testing scenarios. The decrease in lift-to-drag ratio was due to the combination of an increased lift and a higher increased drag.&quot; Other innovations in the late 2000s and early 2010s helped increase the glide ratio further.

==Wingsuit BASE==

As compared to skydiving from an airplane, BASE jumping involves jumping from a &quot;fixed object&quot; such as a cliff. BASE jumping in its modern form has existed since at least 1978, but it was not until 1997 that Patrick de Gayardon made some of the first-ever wingsuit BASE jumps combining the two disciplines. Compared to normal BASE jumping, wingsuit BASE jumping allows pilots to fly far away from the cliffs they jumped from, and drastically increase their freefall time before deploying a parachute. Since 2003, many BASE jumpers have started using wingsuits, giving birth to wingsuit BASE.

A wingsuit BASE jump begins by jumping from a cliff. Within seconds, air inflates the suit into a semi-rigid airfoil shape. By holding a proper body position, the wingsuit flier is able to glide forward at a ratio of 3:1, meaning that they are moving forward three meters for every meter of descent.

As suit technology and pilot skill have improved, wingsuit BASE jumpers have learned to control their flight so that they can fly within several meters of terrain. “Proximity flying” is the practice of flying a wingsuit close to the faces and ridges of mountains. Flying near terrain gives a greater sense of speed due to having a close visual reference. Loic Jean-Albert of France is one of the first proximity flyers, and his pioneering flying brought many BASE jumpers into the sport. In November 2012, Alexander Polli became the first wingsuit BASE jumper to successfully strike a wingsuit target. Polli died August 22, 2016, in a wingsuit accident, after crashing into a tree.

Wingsuit BASE jumping carries additional risk beyond a wingsuit skydive. Jumping from a fixed object means starting with low airspeed which requires different flying positions and skills. During the flight, hazards exist such as trees, rocks and the ground which must be avoided. While skydivers typically carry two parachutes, a main and a reserve, wingsuit BASE jumpers typically only carry one BASE-specific parachute.

Wingsuit BASE jumping is an unregulated sport. But to perform the activity safely requires jumpers to be an experienced skydiver, wingsuit pilot, and BASE jumper. It takes hundreds of practice jumps to achieve skill in each of these disciplines before considering wingsuit BASE.

== Further technical developments ==

=== Jet-powered wingsuits ===
As of 2010, there have been experimental powered wingsuits, often using small jet engines strapped to the feet or a wingpack setup to allow for even greater horizontal speeds and even vertical ascent.

On 25 October 2009, in Lahti, Finland, Visa Parviainen jumped from a hot air balloon in a wingsuit with two small turbojet engines attached to his feet. The engines provided approximately of thrust each and ran on JET A-1 fuel. Parviainen achieved approximately 30 seconds of horizontal flight with no noticeable loss of altitude. Parviainen continued jumping from hot air balloons and helicopters, including one for the &quot;Stunt Junkies&quot; program on Discovery Channel.

Christian Stadler from Germany invented the &quot;VegaV3 wingsuit system&quot; that uses an electronic adjustable hydrogen peroxide rocket. The rocket provides of thrust and produces no flames or poisonous fumes. His first successful powered wingsuit jump was in 2007, when he reached horizontal speeds of over 255 km/h (160 mph).

=== Electric wingsuit ===
In November 2020, professional BASE jumper Peter Salzmann completed the first electric wingsuit flight, using a wingsuit developed by BMW&#x27;s BMW i division.

=== Wingpack ===
Another variation on which studies are being focused is the wingpack, which consists of a strap-on rigid wing made of carbon fibre.

==Training==
Flying a wingsuit can add considerable complexity to a skydive. According to the Skydivers&#x27; Information Manual, the United States Parachute Association requires that any jumper have a minimum of 200 freefall skydives before completing a wingsuit first jump course and making a wingsuit jump. Requirements in other nations are similar. Wingsuit manufacturers offer training courses and certify instructors, and also impose the minimum jump numbers required before purchasing a wingsuit. Wingsuit pilots start on smaller wingsuits with less surface area. With practice, pilots can learn to fly larger suits with more surface area, which allow for increased glide and airtime. Within the sport of wingsuit flying, there are many sub-disciplines that participants may pursue, including: acrobatic flying, performance flying, and wingsuit BASE jumping.

==Records==

=== Wingsuit formation records ===
Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the world governing airsports body, established judging criteria for official world record wingsuit formations in February 2015. The rules are available on the FAI website.

Prior to this, the largest wingsuit formation recognized as meeting the criteria for a national record consisted of 68 wingsuit pilots, which set a U.S. national record at Lake Elsinore, California, on 12 November 2009. The largest global record was a diamond formation involving 100 wingsuit pilots at Perris, California, on 22 September 2012. These records have since been retired as they do not meet the current rules.

Two World Records have been set since the rules update. A 42-person formation over Moorsele, Belgium, set an FAI record on 18 June 2015. This was broken on 17 October 2015, when 61 wingsuit pilots set the current FAI world record over Perris Valley Airport near Perris, California.

The current U.S. national record includes 43 wingsuit pilots. It was set on 5 October 2018 in Rosharon, Texas, at Skydive Spaceland-Houston.

=== Wingsuit BASE jump records ===
====Highest altitude====
On 23 May 2006, the Australian couple Heather Swan and Glenn Singleman jumped from off Meru Peak in India, setting a world record for highest wingsuit BASE jump.
This record was broken on 5 May 2013, by the Russian Valery Rozov, who jumped from on Mount Everest&#x27;s North Col.
Rozov broke his own record by jumping from on Cho Oyu in 2016.

====Longest====
The longest verified wingsuit BASE jump is by the American Dean Potter on 2 November 2011. Potter jumped from the Eiger mountain and spent 3 minutes and 20 seconds in flight, descending of altitude.

====Biggest====
The biggest wingsuit BASE jump as measured from exit to landing was performed on 11 August 2013 by Patrick Kerber with a height of off the Jungfrau in Switzerland.

=== Wingsuit flight records ===
====Fastest====
On 22 May 2017, British wingsuit pilot Fraser Corsan set world records for the fastest speed reached in a wingsuit of .

====Greatest average horizontal speed====
The current world record for greatest average horizontal speed within the performance competition rules, i.e. within of vertical distance, was set by Travis Mickle (US) with a speed of 325.4 km/h (202.19 mph) 6 November 2017. American Ellen Brennan is considered the fastest flying woman in the world.

====Longest time====
On 20 and 21 April 2012, Colombian skydiver Jhonathan Florez set Guinness World Records in wingsuit flying. The jumps took place in La Guajira in Colombia. The longest (duration) wingsuit flight was 9 minutes, 6 seconds

The current world record for longest time in flight within the performance competition rules, i.e. within of vertical distance, was set on 28 Aug 2018 by Chris Geiler (US) with a time of 100.2 sec (1.67 min)

====Highest altitude====
The highest altitude wingsuit jump is , and was achieved by Aaron Smith above Whiteville, Tennessee, US, on 1 July 2023.

====Farthest====
, the Guinness World Record for &quot;greatest absolute distance flown in a wing suit&quot; is 32.094 km (19.94 mi) set by Kyle Lobpries (US) in Davis, California, on 30 May 2016.

The current world record for longest horizontal distance covered within the performance competition rules, i.e. within of vertical distance, was set on 27 May 2017 by U.S. wingsuit pilot Alexey Galda with a distance of 5.137 km (3.19 mi)

==== Highest Flare ====
The highest recorded flare ever achieved so far is in altitude from lowest to highest point, set by Daniel Ossio (CH) in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland on 3 May 2022.

The flare was made after exiting a tail gate aircraft at high speed.

==== Highest Flare (conventional) ====
The highest conventional flare ever made so far is performed by Luke Rogers (AUS), performed in Ramblers, Australia on 9 September 2018.

The flare was made after diving and accelerating the wingsuit from altitude.

====Landing====
On 23 May 2012, British stuntman Gary Connery safely landed a wingsuit without deploying his parachute, landing on a crushable &quot;runway&quot; (landing zone) built with thousands of cardboard boxes.

==Safety==
Recent statistics reflect the growing safety of the wingsuit activity to being comparable to similar flying activities such as hang gliding, with BASE jumpers in the United States seeing a fatality rate of 2 in 1000 participants as compared to hang gliding&#x27;s fatality rate of 1 in 1000 participants. A 2012 University of Colorado study found that in wingsuit BASE jumping, there was approximately one severe injury for every 500 jumps undertaken.

A detailed study on wingsuit deaths completed primarily by the University of Colorado found that out of 180 studied fatalities, 97% launched from cliffs and another 1% from buildings. The vast majority of these deaths were related to the use of the wingsuit, not to do with external sources. This makes aircraft descending a much less deadly form of wingsuit flying, though deemed less extreme by fans of the sport.

==Legality==
Wingsuit flying is broadly allowed and lightly regulated in countries such as Brazil, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, New Zealand, Iceland, India, Russia, Georgia, Mexico, and Venezuela. While the small French city of Chamonix once banned wingsuit flying, the ban has since been reverted.

<text>Solar radius is a unit of distance used to express the size of objects in astronomy relative to the Sun. The solar radius is usually defined as the radius to the layer in the Sun&#x27;s photosphere where the optical depth equals 2/3:

formula_1

 is approximately 10 times the average radius of Jupiter, 109 times the radius of the Earth, and 1/215th of an astronomical unit, the approximate distance between Earth and the Sun. The solar radius to either pole and that to the equator differ slightly due to the Sun&#x27;s rotation, which induces an oblateness in the order of 10 parts per million.

==Measurements==

The uncrewed SOHO spacecraft was used to measure the radius of the Sun by timing transits of Mercury across the surface during 2003 and 2006. The result was a measured radius of .

Haberreiter, Schmutz &amp; Kosovichev (2008) determined the radius corresponding to the solar photosphere to be . This new value is consistent with helioseismic estimates; the same study showed that previous estimates using inflection point methods had been overestimated by approximately .

== Nominal solar radius ==

In 2015, the International Astronomical Union passed Resolution B3, which defined a set of nominal conversion constants for stellar and planetary astronomy. Resolution B3 defined the &quot;nominal solar radius&quot; (symbol formula_2) to be equal to &quot;exactly&quot; . The nominal value, which is the rounded value, within the uncertainty, given by Haberreiter, Schmutz &amp; Kosovichev (2008), was adopted to help astronomers avoid confusion when quoting stellar radii in units of the Sun&#x27;s radius, even when future observations will likely refine the Sun&#x27;s actual photospheric radius (which is currently only known to about an accuracy of ±).

==Examples==
Solar radii as a unit are common when describing spacecraft moving close to the sun. Two spacecraft in the 2010s include:

*Solar Orbiter (as close as )
*Parker Solar Probe (as close as )

<text>Bo Xilai (; born 3 July 1949) is a Chinese former politician who was convicted on bribery and embezzlement charges. He came to prominence through his tenures as Mayor of Dalian and then the governor of Liaoning. From 2004 to November 2007, he served as Minister of Commerce. Between 2007 and 2012, he served as a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Party Secretary of Chongqing, a direct-administered municipality under the central government. He was generally considered the main political opponent of Xi Jinping before Xi became the paramount leader of China.

He is the son of former Chinese Vice Premier Bo Yibo. He cultivated a casual and charismatic image in a marked departure from Chinese political convention. In Chongqing, Bo initiated a campaign against organized crime, increased spending on welfare programs, maintained consistent double-digit percentage GDP growth, and campaigned to revive Cultural Revolution-era &quot;red culture&quot;. Bo&#x27;s promotion of egalitarian values and the achievements of his &quot;Chongqing model&quot; made him the champion of the Chinese New Left, composed of both Maoists and social democrats disillusioned with the country&#x27;s market-based economic reforms and increasing economic inequality. However, the perceived lawlessness of Bo&#x27;s anti-corruption campaigns, coupled with concerns about the personality cult, made him a controversial figure.

Bo was considered a likely candidate for promotion to the elite CCP Politburo Standing Committee at the 18th Party Congress in 2012. However, his political fortunes came to an abrupt end following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu. Wang claimed to have information about the involvement of Bo and his wife Gu Kailai in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, who allegedly had close financial ties to the two. In the fallout, Bo was removed as the CCP Committee secretary of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. He was later stripped of all his positions and lost his seat at the National People&#x27;s Congress and eventually expelled from the party. In 2013, Bo was found guilty of corruption, stripped of all his assets and sentenced to life imprisonment. He is incarcerated at Qincheng Prison.

== Family background ==
Bo Xilai&#x27;s father was the Communist revolutionary Bo Yibo, one of the Eight Great Eminent Officials, who served as Minister of Finance in the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China but who fell from favor in 1965 for supporting more open trade relations with the West. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Bo Yibo, labeled a &quot;rightist&quot; and &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot;, was purged from his posts and spent the ensuing twelve years in prison. Bo Xilai&#x27;s mother, Hu Ming, was abducted by Red Guards in Guangzhou, and was either beaten to death or committed suicide.

Bo Yibo had seven children. Aside from his eldest daughter, Bo Xiying, born to his first wife, Li Ruming, the rest were born to his second wife, Hu Ming. They are: eldest son Bo Xiyong, second son Bo Xilai, third son Bo Xicheng, fourth son Bo Xining, second daughter Bo Jieying, and youngest daughter Bo Xiaoying. Except for Xiaoying, a historian at Peking University, Bo Xilai&#x27;s other siblings are active in politics and business. As of 2012, reports estimated the Bo family&#x27;s total assets were worth between $136 million and $160 million.

== Early life ==
Bo Xilai was seventeen years old when the Cultural Revolution began, and at the time attended the prestigious Beijing No. 4 High School. In the early years of the Cultural Revolution, Bo Xilai is reported to have been an active member of the &quot;liandong&quot; Red Guard organization and may have at one point denounced his father.

As the political winds of the Cultural Revolution shifted, Bo Xilai and his siblings were either imprisoned or sent to the countryside, and Bo Xilai was locked up for five years. After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the chaos of the Cultural Revolution was officially attributed to the Gang of Four, and Bo&#x27;s father was released. Bo Yibo was politically rehabilitated, and, in 1979, became vice premier.

After his release, Bo Xilai worked at the Hardware Repair Factory for the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau. He was admitted to the Peking University when the &quot;gaokao&quot; was reinstated in 1977. Unlike many of his contemporaries in the Chinese leadership who studied engineering, Bo majored in world history. In his second year at Peking University, after the graduate school examination was reinstated, Bo was admitted to a master&#x27;s program in international journalism at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, allegedly through backdoor channels despite not meeting the required exam scores, and graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in 1982. He joined the Communist Party in October 1980.

==Early career==
During the 1980s, the Bo family regained its political influence. Bo Yibo served successively as vice premier and vice-chairman of the Central Advisory Commission. The elder Bo came to be known as one of the &quot;Eight Elders&quot; or &quot;Eight Immortals&quot; of the Communist Party and was instrumental in the implementation of market reforms in the 1980s. Although he favored more liberal economic policies, the elder Bo was politically conservative, and endorsed the use of military force against demonstrators during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After the 1989 crackdown, Bo Yibo helped ensure the ascent of Jiang Zemin to succeed Deng Xiaoping as the leader of the Party and helped Jiang consolidate power in the 1990s. Bo Yibo remained a prominent figure in the party until his death in 2007 and was influential in shaping his son&#x27;s career.

After the graduate school, Bo Xilai was assigned to Zhongnanhai, where he worked with the research office of the CCP Central Committee Secretariat and CCP Central Committee General Office. In the early 1980s, Bo requested a transfer away from Beijing, a move masterminded by his father for both political and personal reasons. Politically, Bo, inspired by the protagonist Li Xiangnan in the popular Chinese television drama &quot;New Star&quot; (1986)—adapted from a novel by Ke Yunlu, which was partly based on Xi Jinping, then deputy party secretary in Zhengding County, Hebei—aspired to gain grassroots experience and credentials to climb the CCP&#x27;s political ladder. Personally, Bo was engaged in a four-year legal battle to divorce his first wife, Li Danyu, which was finalized in 1984. Facing persistent complaints and petitions from Li, who jepordized his career by publicly accusing him of having an extramarital affair with his Peking University schoolmate Gu Kailai, Bo relocated to Dalian to avoid the controversy.

==Dalian and Liaoning==

=== Dalian ===
In 1984, Bo was appointed deputy party secretary of Jin County, now Jinzhou District of Dalian, where Cui Ronghan, an old comrade-in-arms of Bo Yibo, was the municipal party secretary. Bo subsequently became deputy secretary and then secretary of the party committee of the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone and secretary of the Jinzhou party committee. Rising again in rank within the party, he became a member of the Standing Committee of the Dalian Municipal CCP Committee, the city&#x27;s top decision-making body, and became the Vice-mayor of Dalian in 1990. In 1993, Bo became deputy party secretary and mayor of Dalian. He remained mayor until 2000. Bo served as Dalian&#x27;s deputy party secretary from 1995. Bo was promoted to CCP Committee Secretary in 1999 and served in that position until 2000.

Bo&#x27;s tenure in Dalian was marked by the city&#x27;s phenomenal transformation from a drab port city to a modern metropolis, a &#x27;showcase&#x27; of China&#x27;s rapid economic growth. In the early 1990s, Bo took some credit for the construction of the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway, China&#x27;s first controlled-access freeway, winning accolades for the rapid expansion of infrastructure and for environmental work. Since Bo&#x27;s time in office, Dalian became known as one of the cleanest cities in China, having won the UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award in 1999. In addition, Bo was an advocate for free enterprise and small businesses, and successfully courted foreign investment from East Asian neighbours such as South Korea and Japan, as well as Western countries. In contrast to his colleagues, he held press conferences during the Chinese New Year, and developed a reputation among foreign investors for &quot;getting things done&quot;.

Bo spent seven years in the city of Dalian, a lengthy term in comparison to colleagues of the same rank, who are often transferred to different locales throughout their careers. Despite the accompanying economic growth and rise in living standards, Bo&#x27;s tenure in Dalian has sometimes been criticized as having been too focused on aesthetic development projects such as expansive boulevards, monuments, and large public parks. To make way for his large-scale projects, Bo&#x27;s administration moved large numbers of local residents from downtown areas into new homes in the city&#x27;s outskirts. Dalian&#x27;s greenery was dubbed &quot;Xilai Grass&quot;. In addition, he spearheaded the construction of a &quot;huabiao&quot; in the city. In 2000, Bo was frontrunner for the post of Mayor of Shenzhen, based on his success in making Dalian the &quot;Hong Kong of the North&quot;. However it was suggested that Bo was too independent and outspoken for the post. The post went to Yu Youjun instead.

===15th Party Congress===
During the 15th Party Congress in 1997, Bo Xilai&#x27;s family launched an unsuccessful campaign to secure his promotion to become a member of the Central Committee of the CCP. Although nepotism was generally frowned upon in China, Bo Yibo&#x27;s ambitions for his son were well-known. Bo Yibo advanced the idea that revolutionary elders should &#x27;nominate&#x27; their children to become high officials, and Bo Xilai was selected as his family&#x27;s &#x27;representative&#x27; over his older brother Bo Xicheng, ostensibly because of Xilai&#x27;s superior academic credentials, which included attendance at the elite Peking University and a master&#x27;s degree.

In order to secure Bo Xilai&#x27;s selection for promotion during the 15th Party Congress, the family launched a nationwide campaign to publicize his son&#x27;s &quot;achievements&quot; as mayor of Dalian. They commissioned author Chen Zufeng to pen a report portraying Bo as a man who is &quot;as statesman-like as Henry Kissinger, as environmentally conscious as Al Gore, and almost as beloved by the public as Princess Diana.&quot; Despite the publicity campaign, Bo Xilai failed even to gain a seat in the Liaoning provincial delegation to the Party Congress. Ultimately, Bo Yibo helped him gain a seat with the Shanxi delegation, but the younger Bo was unable to secure a promotion.

In addition, Bo Xilai placed second-last in the confirmation vote for membership in the 15th CCP Central Committee. As he placed in the bottom 5% of candidates, Bo Xilai was denied entry into the elite council, suffering a major political embarrassment. Bo&#x27;s failure to get elected was attributed to a general opposition to nepotism within the Party. Moreover, during his tenure in Dalian, Bo caused resentment for the amount of &#x27;special favours&#x27; that he procured for the coastal city at the expense of the rest of the province. His perceived partisan interests locked Bo&#x27;s kin in a factional struggle against Li Tieying, one of China&#x27;s central leadership figures, who may have created obstacles to his promotion.

===Provincial Governor===
In 2001, a corruption scandal involving former Liaoning governor Zhang Guoguang provided an opportunity for Bo&#x27;s advancement. Prior to the 15th Party Congress, Bo Yibo and Bo Xilai assisted then-party general secretary Jiang Zemin in preparing to force political rival Qiao Shi into retirement. The Bo family also supported Jiang&#x27;s &quot;Three Stresses&quot; (&quot;San Jiang&quot;) campaign in 1997, which was intended to strengthen ideological conviction and promote internal unity in the Communist Party; however, the campaign was generally seen as lacklustre by observers and not universally embraced even inside the party leadership. The Bos&#x27; unwavering support for Jiang was said to have worked in Bo Xilai&#x27;s favour when the vacancy for Governor of Liaoning opened. Bo became acting governor in 2001 after the dismissal and arrest of Zhang Guoguang, and was officially confirmed as governor in 2003. In his position as governor, which he held until 2004, Bo gained membership to the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

During his tenure in Liaoning, Bo played a critical role in the promotion of the Northeast Area Revitalization Plan. Adopted in 2003 by party authorities, the policy aimed to strengthen economic development in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang. Bo Xilai was particularly enthusiastic about the policy, stating his desire to see the Northeast become &quot;China&#x27;s fourth economic engine&quot; (the others being the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and the Bohai Economic Region).

The Northeast was at one time known as the &quot;cradle of industrialization&quot; of China. In 1980, industrial output for Liaoning alone was twice that of the Guangdong. However, the northeast was left behind amidst market reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, while Guangdong and other provinces along the South and East China Sea coasts prospered. Its economy—still largely tied to state-owned enterprises—stagnated relative to other regions, with high unemployment rates. The revitalisation plan aimed to address this by reviving the region&#x27;s traditional industries, strengthening trade ties with and encouraging investment from South Korea and Japan, and experimenting with free trade zones in select cities. In 2004, official media reported that foreign direct investment in Liaoning had nearly doubled since the launch in 2003 of the northeastern rejuvenation strategy.

Although Bo established a reputation as a comparatively clean politician during his tenures in Dalian and as governor of Liaoning, he was not immune to corruption allegations. In particular, Bo was the subject of critical investigative reports by Liaoning journalist Jiang Weiping, the whistleblower in the &quot;Mu and Ma&quot; corruption case in Liaoning – a scandal that Bo benefited from politically. While Bo was not directly involved in the scandal, Jiang accused Bo of providing political cover for his friends and relatives. Jiang was initially sentenced to eight years in prison on trumped-up charges, for which Bo was criticized, but was released after five years under international pressure.

Yang Rong, the founder and former chief executive of China&#x27;s largest automaker Brilliance China Automotive, accused Bo of interfering in his judicial proceedings in Beijing. Yang had made a bid to locate a Brilliance factory in Ningbo, China. In his attempt Yang incurred the wrath of Bo, as Bo demanded that Yang locate the factory in Liaoning, and Yang refused. In 2002, Bo seized Yang&#x27;s stake of $700 million in Brilliance. Bo also accused Yang of embezzlement, and had an arrest warrant issued against him, precipitating Yang&#x27;s flight from China in July 2002; since then Yang has been living in exile in the United States.

In addition, Bo openly clashed with Wen Shizhen, then-party secretary in Liaoning who was technically Bo&#x27;s superior. Wen reportedly criticized Bo for &quot;developing China&#x27;s cities like Europe and its countryside like Africa,&quot; and even held a party to celebrate Bo&#x27;s departure from Liaoning in 2004.

Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong allegations that Liaoning was the epicenter of organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, suggested that he may have used his involvement as a way of building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, claimed Bo may have played a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity. In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong based on those allegations.

===16th Party Congress===
At the 16th Party Congress in 2002, Bo&#x27;s age, regional tenures, and patronage links fit the profile for a potential candidate to be groomed for the &quot;5th generation of leaders&quot; that would assume power in 2012. His chief competitors were seen as Xi Jinping, then party secretary of Zhejiang, and Li Keqiang, a populist &quot;Tuanpai&quot; candidate who was the Governor of Henan. As with the 15th Party Congress five years earlier, the elder Bo lobbied for his son&#x27;s promotion. The Bo family enjoyed the patronage of Jiang Zemin. However, Bo Xilai&#x27;s unequivocal support for Jiang strengthened the reluctance of his political opponents to support his nomination. Ultimately, although Bo Xilai remained a top contender for higher promotion, Xi and Li remained the main candidates to succeed Hu Jintao as paramount leader.

==Minister of Commerce==
When Hu Jintao succeeded Jiang Zemin as CCP General Secretary in late 2002, Bo&#x27;s career as a local official ended with his appointment to Minister of Commerce in Premier Wen Jiabao&#x27;s cabinet to replace Lü Fuyuan, who retired for health reasons. Bo also earned a seat on the 16th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Bo&#x27;s stint as Minister of Commerce significantly raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in his approach to problems, Bo&#x27;s rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a &quot;political star&quot;. Bo&#x27;s political persona was considered a departure from the generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo&#x27;s political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.

Bo presided over a continued rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By the time that he became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo was one of the few ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington, D.C. On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.

Bo also oversaw the restructuring of the Ministry, formed from the amalgamation of the National Economics and Commerce Bureau and the Department of International Trade. Bo sought to balance the amount of attention given to foreign investors and domestic commercial institutions. He began tackling the imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to that point was largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries&#x27; competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.

===17th Party Congress===
At the 17th Party Congress in October 2007, Bo gained a seat on the 25-member Politburo, effectively China&#x27;s ruling council. He was then tipped to leave the Ministry of Commerce and take over as CCP Committee secretary of Chongqing. Bo&#x27;s predecessor, political rival Wang Yang, was reassigned as party secretary of Guangdong.

At the time, Chongqing was reeling from problems such as air and water pollution, unemployment, poor public health, and complications from the Three Gorges Dam. According to analysts, Hu Jintao wanted to transfer his ally Wang Yang out of Chongqing before these problems intensified. Bo was initially reluctant to go to Chongqing and was reportedly unhappy with his new assignment. He had hoped to become vice premier instead, but Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier Wu Yi argued against Bo&#x27;s promotion to vice-premiership. In particular, Wu was critical of Bo&#x27;s penchant for self-promotion, and Wen cited international lawsuits against Bo by Falun Gong adherents as a barrier to his holding higher office.

Bo took up the Chongqing post on 30 November, a month following the conclusion of the Congress, even though Wang Yang had vacated the position on 13 November. Whilst some saw this transfer as a &#x27;banishment&#x27; from the central government to the hinterlands to keep Bo&#x27;s perceived arrogance and high-profile antics out of Beijing&#x27;s view, others considered it a promotion since being the party secretary in one of the four direct-administered municipalities came with an &quot;ex officio&quot; seat on the Politburo.

==Chongqing==
===The Chongqing model===

Although Bo was initially unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved to use his new position as a staging ground for a return to higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the CCP Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving as the head of the party&#x27;s security apparatus.

In Chongqing, Bo pioneered a new style of governance dubbed the &quot;Chongqing Model&quot; – a set of social and economic policies intended to address diverse challenges facing modern China following economic reforms. This made him the champion of the Chinese New Left, composed of both Maoists and social democrats disillusioned with the country&#x27;s market-based economic reforms and increasing economic inequality.

The Chongqing model was characterized in part by increased state control and the promotion of a neo-leftist ideology. Along with his police chief Wang Lijun, Bo launched a sweeping campaign against organized crime, and increased the security and police presence in the city. Critics noted these policies were accompanied by the erosion of the rule of law, and allegations surfaced of political and personal rivals being victimized amidst Bo&#x27;s anti-corruption drive. As a means of addressing declining public morality, Bo launched a &quot;red culture&quot; movement to promote Maoist-era socialist ethics. On the economic front, he actively courted foreign investment—much as he had done in Liaoning. The Chongqing model was also characterized by massive public works programs, subsidized housing for the poor, and social policies intended to make it easier for rural citizens to move to the city, thus reaping the benefits of urban status.

The Chongqing model provided an alternate development paradigm that diverged from the policies preferred by those in the national leadership seen as favouring further reform such as Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. Bo&#x27;s leadership in Chongqing dramatically raised his profile, both nationally and internationally. In 2010, he was named as one of the &#x27;World&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in 2010&#x27; by &quot;Time&quot;. Observers noted that, in China&#x27;s non-electoral political system, Bo&#x27;s high-profile presence and bold political maneuvers essentially amounted to a public &#x27;election campaign&#x27; for the top leadership. However, he drew the ire of some of the country&#x27;s leaders; President Hu and Premier Wen were reluctant to acknowledge Bo publicly, ostensibly due to a discomfort over his leadership style.

====Organized crime====

Bo&#x27;s tenure in Chongqing was dominated by a protracted war against organized crime and corruption known as &quot;&quot; (). Between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries. The campaign was overseen by Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning.

Wen Qiang, one of the most prominent figures implicated in the trials, had been a prominent municipal official since the days of party secretaries He Guoqiang and Wang Yang. Wen, the former executive deputy commissioner of the Chongqing police force Public Security for 16 years, was tried and convicted of a litany of crimes and sentenced to death in a sensational headline-grabbing trial. Contrary to the popular perception at the time that the campaign was part of Bo&#x27;s perceived penchant for self-promotion, China observer Willy Lam suggested that such a large-scale crackdown will have received approval from central authorities, including Hu Jintao, and that Bo became careful to not let Chongqing appear to be trying to &#x27;set an example&#x27; for the rest of the country so he could benefit from the success politically.

The &quot;dahei&quot; campaign earned Bo national recognition and widespread popularity in Chongqing—all the more because of the city&#x27;s historical reputation as a center for criminal activity. In contrast to often colourless and orthodox politicians, Bo gained the reputation as a party boss that &quot;got things done&quot;. The apparent success of &quot;dǎhēi&quot; earned Bo &#x27;rock star status&#x27;, and resulted in calls to replicate the campaign on a nationwide scale. Through the campaign, Bo gained the support of a number of powerful members of the Politburo Standing Committee, including Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping and Zhou Yongkang, all of whom visited Chongqing or praised Bo&#x27;s achievements sometime between 2010 and 2011.

However, Bo&#x27;s campaign was criticized for running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labour. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and in at least one case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo&#x27;s popular social housing programs. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that US$11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive as a result of a land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that US$700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.

====Red culture movement====

During his time in Chongqing, Bo initiated a series of Maoist-style campaigns to revive &#x27;red culture&#x27; and improve public morale, known as &quot;&quot; (). The initiative included the promotion of Maoist quotes, &#x27;red&#x27; songs, revolutionary television programming and operas, and initiatives to encourage students to work in the countryside, akin to the way students were required to do during the Down to the Countryside Movement of the Cultural Revolution. As part of the movement, Bo and the city&#x27;s Media Department initiated a &quot;Red Songs campaign&quot; that demanded every district, government department, commercial enterprise, educational institution, state radio and TV stations begin singing &#x27;red songs&#x27; praising the achievements of the Communist Party. Bo pledged to reinvigorate the city with the Marxist ideals reminiscent of the Mao era.

Prior to the 60th Anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China celebrations, for instance, Bo sent out &#x27;red text messages&#x27; to the city&#x27;s 13 million mobile phone users. According to &quot;Xinhua&quot;, Bo&#x27;s text messages were usually quotes from Mao&#x27;s Little Red Book, and include phrases such as &quot;I like how chairman Mao puts it: The world is ours, we will all have to work together,&quot; and &quot;responsibility and seriousness can conquer the world, and the Chinese Communist Party members represent these qualities.&quot; Bo and his team of municipal administrators also erected new Mao statues in Chongqing, while providing &#x27;social security apartments&#x27; to the city&#x27;s less well-off. Some scholars have characterized this as an example of the revival of Maoism in the Chinese Communist ethos.

Reactions to the red culture movement were divided. Bo&#x27;s revival of Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within much of the middle to lower income strata of Chongqing society, and made Bo a star with both conventional Marxists and neo-leftists. Bo won praise for returning the city to what some called China&#x27;s &#x27;true socialist heritage&#x27; by de-emphasizing material wealth, and evoked nostalgia to the social egalitarianism that existed during Mao&#x27;s time. Some retirees were particularly inspired and said they wanted to pass on &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; to their children, while others participated as a means to praise the Communist Party for the country&#x27;s economic progress.

The campaign also had many detractors. Some intellectuals and reformers criticized the campaign for being regressive, akin to &quot;being drowned in a red sea&quot;, and bringing back painful memories from the Cultural Revolution. Several mid-level officials in the city committed suicide due to overwhelming pressure to organize events for the red songs campaign. Bo&#x27;s critics derisively referred to him as &quot;little Mao&quot;.

====Social policies====
A cornerstone of Bo&#x27;s Chongqing model involved a series of egalitarian social policies aimed to lessen the gap between rich and poor, and ease the rural-urban divide. Bo promoted the notion of pursuing &quot;red GDP&quot;—an economic model embodying communist egalitarianism—and suggested that, if economic development were analogous to &#x27;baking a cake&#x27;, then the primary task should be to divide the cake fairly rather than building a larger cake.

To that end, the city reportedly spent $15.8 billion on public apartment complexes for use by recent college graduates, migrant workers and low-income residents. In 2007, the cities of Chongqing and Chengdu were selected to run pilot projects intended to mitigate the rural-urban divide and ease integration of rural residents into the cities. Under China&#x27;s &quot;hukou&quot; registration system at the time, citizens were classified as either rural or urban—a distinction that affected educational opportunities, health benefits, and social welfare, effectively making rural &quot;hukou&quot; holders &quot;second class citizens&quot;. Of Chongqing&#x27;s 32 million residents, only 27% held urban &quot;hukou&quot; as of 2007. The 2007 project made it easier for rural residents to obtain urban status, a policy intended not only to help balance inequality, but also to enable the government to develop underused rural land. Under Bo&#x27;s leadership, Chongqing established &quot;land exchanges&quot; where rural villages could earn credits for maximizing farmland.

Bo&#x27;s approach to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers take to the streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labour unrest on criminal instigation. Bo&#x27;s government instead held a televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling of the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.

====Economic policies====
Another major component of Bo&#x27;s Chongqing model concerned the city&#x27;s economic policies. Just as he had done in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.

Bo&#x27;s model of economic growth won national and international praise for seamlessly combining foreign investment and state-led growth. However, Bo&#x27;s critics called the model of &quot;red GDP&quot; – subsidized infrastructure, housing and public works projects – unsustainable and a drain on the city&#x27;s budget. Some civil servants complained that they were not getting salaries on time. Chongqing received a disproportionately high share (some US$34 billion) of stimulus money from Beijing in 2008. Political rivals such as Bo&#x27;s predecessor Wang Yang also suggested that economic figures in Chongqing were &quot;rigged&quot;—artificially inflated through unnecessary construction and public works projects.

===Leadership style===
Although many of Bo&#x27;s campaigns earned popular support, especially from the city&#x27;s poor, his leadership style has been described as &quot;propagandistic&quot;, &quot;ruthless&quot;, and &quot;arrogant&quot; by subordinates and city officials, academics, journalists, and other professionals. He cultivated a casual and charismatic image in a marked departure from Chinese political convention. Michael Wines of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that although Bo was possessed of &quot;prodigious charisma and deep intelligence&quot;, these qualities were offset by a &quot;studied indifference to the wrecked lives that littered his path to power... Mr. Bo&#x27;s ruthlessness stood out, even in a system where the absence of formal rules ensures that only the strongest advance.&quot; Bo placed onerous demands on government officials in the city, requiring them to be available to work all day and all night, seven days a week. He reportedly called subordinates to late-night meetings, publicly criticized and humiliated those with whom he disagreed, and even hit underlings who failed to meet his demands. According to a psychologist quoted by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, since Bo Xilai assumed power, &quot;depression, burn out and suicides have all risen among officials... Officials now make up the largest share of patients [seeking] counselling in the city.&quot;

In late 2009, a popular investigative television show on China Central Television aired a critical story on Bo&#x27;s anti-crime drive, expressing concern over the apparent disregard for legal due process. In response, Bo used his connections to have the show&#x27;s host temporarily banned from the airwaves, and its producer moved to another program. Others who opposed Bo&#x27;s initiatives were also met with retribution. Li Zhuang, a defense lawyer from Beijing, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison (later reduced to 18 months) in 2009 for attempting to defend one of the high-profile targets of Bo&#x27;s crackdown. Cheng Li, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said that &quot;Nobody really trusts [Bo]: a lot of people are scared of him, including several princelings who are supposed to be his power base.&quot;

===Alleged eavesdropping operations===
As part of Bo&#x27;s efforts to fight crime and maintain social and political stability in Chongqing, he initiated a major electronic surveillance operation. Wang Lijun, Chongqing&#x27;s police chief, served as the architect of the state-funded project, which was described in official media as a &quot;comprehensive package bugging system covering telecommunications to the Internet.&quot; The system involved wiretaps, eavesdropping, and monitoring of internet communications, and was designed with the help of cybersecurity expert Fang Binxing, known for his pivotal role in the construction of China&#x27;s Great Firewall.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the eavesdropping operations did not only target local criminals, but also the communications of top Chinese leaders, including those of President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing to better understand what they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo&#x27;s orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and played a role in the falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo&#x27;s downfall in 2012.

===Death of Neil Heywood===
On 14 November 2011, British citizen Neil Heywood was found dead in his Chongqing hotel room. At the time, local authorities declared he had died from alcohol over-consumption. The official cause of death was not scrutinized until several months later, when revelations emerged that Heywood&#x27;s death was a homicide, and Bo Xilai was implicated.

Heywood served as an intermediary linking Western companies to powerful Chinese politicians. He was a long-time associate of the Bo family: he reportedly shared a close personal relationship with Bo&#x27;s wife, Gu Kailai. Even though it was confirmed that Fido Vivien-May, a volunteer at Royal British Legion whom Gu had met through Bo Guagua&#x27;s language school in Bournemouth, introduced and helped Bo Guagua&#x27;s application to Harrow School, after Bo Xilai&#x27;s fall, it was widely misreported that Heywood, a Harrow alumnus, had helped Bo Guagua earn admission to Harrow School, when Heywood in fact did not know the Bo family at the time. Heywood later served as a middleman for the family, helping them move and manage properties overseas.

In October 2011, Heywood reportedly had a business dispute with Gu Kailai, which escalated when Heywood threatened to reveal the family&#x27;s business dealings and &quot;destroy&quot; Bo Guagua, who was studying in the US. Heywood was then poisoned by Gu and her aide Zhang Xiaojun. In August 2012, Gu was convicted of the murder and receive a suspended death sentence, which was commuted to life imprisonment in 2015. Meanwhile, Zhang was sentenced to nine years&#x27; jail for acting as an accomplice in the poisoning. His sentence was reduced by a total of 26 months on three occasions—in 2014, 2015, and 2017—due to good behavior, which scheduled his release for May 2019. However, he was released earlier, at an unknown date no later than January 2018, as he joined the Bo family at a memorial event for Bo Yibo at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing on January 17, 2018.

==Downfall==

===Wang Lijun incident===

In early 2012, the party&#x27;s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection bolstered its presence within Chongqing as the city&#x27;s leaders came under investigation. Much of the attention focused on Bo&#x27;s police chief, Wang Lijun, who may have been under investigation for his role in a corruption case in Liaoning. Growing scrutiny over the city&#x27;s wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang. Although details are scarce, several sources have suggested that Wang&#x27;s resentment against Bo grew amidst the investigations—resentment that was compounded when Wang realized that he and his wife had also been targets of wiretapping under Bo&#x27;s orders.

Moreover, Wang was privy to details of Neil Heywood&#x27;s death, and had reportedly attempted to voice his concerns to Bo about alleged poisoning. Around 16 January, Wang is believed to have confronted Bo over evidence that implicated Bo&#x27;s wife in the murder. Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations. Wang was abruptly demoted on 2 February to the far less prestigious position of Vice-mayor overseeing education, science, and environmental affairs. Bo placed Wang under surveillance, and several of his close associates were reportedly taken into custody. Some reports allege that Bo may have been plotting to have Wang assassinated.

On 6 February 2012, apparently fearing for his life, Wang traveled to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu, bringing evidence implicating Bo and his family in the Neil Heywood murder. Wang sought and was denied asylum in the United States. He remained in the consulate for approximately 24 hours before leaving &quot;of his own volition&quot; and being taken into the custody of state security officials dispatched from Beijing. Local media in Chongqing announced that he was on a mental health-related sick leave.

A day after Wang&#x27;s leave, several overseas Chinese-language news websites posted an open letter allegedly penned by Wang, which sharply criticized Bo as a &quot;hypocrite&quot; and &quot;the greatest gangster in China&quot; and accused Bo of corruption. Without knowing what incriminating material Wang may have held against Bo, even Bo&#x27;s supporters in China&#x27;s top leadership were reluctant to vouch for him. Bo responded in an unusually open press conference during the 2012 National People&#x27;s Congress, acknowledging &quot;negligent supervision&quot; of his subordinates, saying he may have &quot;relied upon the wrong person&quot;.

===Removal from posts===
On 15 March 2012, Bo was dismissed as Chongqing party secretary and its related municipal posts, while temporarily retaining a seat on the Politburo. Due to the potentially destructive effects Bo&#x27;s dismissal would have on party unity, party elders were consulted on the matter. The decision was reportedly made at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, which Bo had been expected to gain a position on in the future, on 7 March. Secretary of the CPLC Zhou Yongkang cast a lone dissenting vote. On 14 March, Bo was reprimanded by Premier Wen Jiabao during the Premier&#x27;s annual press conference. Wen called the achievements of Chongqing &quot;significant&quot;, but the result of &quot;multiple administrations&quot;, i.e., not just Bo himself. Wen also made numerous allusions to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution, an indirect rebuke of Bo&#x27;s efforts to revive &quot;red culture&quot;. Addressing high-level political changes by a Premier to an open public forum was unprecedented. Political observers believe that Wen&#x27;s remarks and Bo&#x27;s downfall represented a consensus within the central leadership that Bo not only needed to shoulder the responsibility for the Wang Lijun scandal, but also represented a political triumph for the &#x27;liberal reformer&#x27; wing of the Communist Party.

On 10 April 2012, Bo was suspended from the CCP Central Committee and Politburo, pending investigation for &quot;serious disciplinary violations&quot;. Bo&#x27;s wife, Gu Kailai, was named a prime suspect in the inquiry into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. The announcement, carrying criminal implications, was the death knell for Bo&#x27;s political career.

On 28 September 2012, the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party adopted a decision to expel him from the party. The decision was ratified by a full plenary session of the Central Committee on 4 November. He was accused of major disciplinary violations and corruption charges during his tenure in Dalian, the Ministry of Commerce and Chongqing, including in relation to the Gu Kailai case. On 26 October 2012, the Standing Committee of the 11th National People&#x27;s Congress expelled him as a deputy to the national legislature, removing his final public post and setting the stage for his trial.

=== Public reactions ===
Bo&#x27;s downfall elicited strong reactions among the Chinese public and with commentators across the political spectrum. Leftist websites such as &quot;Utopia&quot;, &quot;Red China&quot;, and &quot;Maoflag&quot; were full of angry commentary over Bo&#x27;s dismissal. These websites were shut down for a period of &quot;maintenance&quot; shortly after. Leftist commentators voiced support for Bo: Kong Qingdong called Bo&#x27;s dismissal &quot;a plot by enemies of the state&quot;; Sima Nan said associating Bo with the Cultural Revolution was a &quot;smear campaign&quot;; Sima&#x27;s pro-Bo microblogs were censored. Large numbers of sympathetic posts for Bo appeared in microblogs from Chongqing, and Dalian, where Bo was once mayor. The nationalist tabloid &quot;Global Times&quot; also wrote a sympathetic editorial. Liberal media reacted positively, believing Bo&#x27;s style of &quot;personality-based rule&quot; was dangerous and regressive, and claiming his downfall signified a &quot;correct orientation&quot; to China&#x27;s future development. The liberal Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group editor Yan Lieshan remarked that Bo correctly identified China&#x27;s problems but prescribed the wrong solution. Businesspeople whose assets were seized by Bo&#x27;s administration in Chongqing also reacted positively.

Bo&#x27;s dismissal caused political shockwaves unseen since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and exposing internal conflicts within the Communist Party. In the weeks following 15 March, party authorities deliberated on Bo&#x27;s case. In the absence of official reports of the proceedings, microblogs churned out a flood of speculation, including rumours of a coup. In response, the authorities instructed newspapers and websites to strictly report only official releases, and arrested six people accused of &quot;rumourmongering&quot;.

Aware of its potentially divisive impact, authorities carefully controlled media coverage of Bo&#x27;s removal from office. State media reported &#x27;pledges of loyalty&#x27; to the party&#x27;s decision to disgrace Bo, including statements from the new Chongqing party authorities, Beijing municipal organs, and grassroots party members rallying to the party line. The party&#x27;s mouthpiece &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; issued a front-page editorial calling for unity behind the &quot;correct decision&quot;. The military held &#x27;political education&#x27; sessions on short notice, stressing unity and loyalty to the Party under the leadership of Hu Jintao. Bo&#x27;s downfall also affected his ally Zhou Yongkang, who had reportedly relinquished his operational control over Chinese security institutions and lost the right to influence who would succeed him at the 18th Party Congress.

=== Trial ===
In July 2013, Chinese prosecution authorities charged Bo with bribery, abuse of power and corruption, paving the way for his trial. In the build-up to the trial, Song Yangbiao, a prominent leftist supporter of Bo was detained by police after he urged people to protest against the trial. The verdict and sentence brought to close one of the most lurid political scandals in the history of China under Communist rule. A few days before the trial, Wang Xuemei, a prominent forensic scientist who was vice director of the Chinese Forensic Medicine Association and of the Supreme Court&#x27;s Prosecutorial Research Center, resigned from her positions. Wang had publicly questioned the forensic evidence used in the trial of Bo&#x27;s wife Gu Kailai. Defense counsel for Bo was Beijing-based DeHeng Law Offices, a corporate law firm with deep political connections to the state. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; article on the law firm&#x27;s role in the trial described it as acting as an &quot;intermediary&quot; that facilitated between Bo, his relatives and prosecutors the negotiation of &quot;an outcome acceptable to all sides in the run-up to the trial—and to help ensure that the trial itself goes according to plan&quot;.

Beginning on 22 August 2013, the Jinan Intermediate People&#x27;s Court heard Bo&#x27;s case. Bo faced three charges: bribery, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The prosecutors alleged that Bo received the equivalent of some 21.79 million yuan (US$3.56 million) in bribes from businessmen Xu Ming and Tang Xiaolin. At the trial Xu testified that he gave Bo&#x27;s wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa &quot;Fontaine St-Georges&quot; in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua&#x27;s travel and credit card bills. Bo Xilai cross-examined Xu and denied knowledge of many of the payments. Bo&#x27;s trial also featured a testy exchange between Bo and his former lieutenant Wang Lijun, during which Bo claimed that his knowledge of Wang&#x27;s crush on Gu was the real reason for Wang&#x27;s defection to the U.S. consulate.

The proceedings of the trial were relayed in real time via the court&#x27;s Weibo account, but parts of Bo&#x27;s testimony, particularly those regarding the threats and mistreatment he experienced during the investigation and his emotional remarks about his wife, were censored. Some details omitted from the trial transcript on Weibo include Bo&#x27;s testimony that he had been interrogated hundreds of times and had fainted 27 times, and that he had confessed to one bribery charge the previous year only after being warned that his wife could face the death penalty and his son, Bo Guagua, who had just graduated from Harvard University, could be issued a Red Notice and brought back to China. &quot;I felt like there were two other lives tethered to mine,&quot; Bo said.

Eventually, at his trial, Bo recanted a series of confessions he had made during the investigation, denying all charges against him. On 22 September, the court found him guilty on all counts, including accepting bribes and abuses of power, stripped him of all his personal assets, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

=== Aftermath ===
Not long after the trial, on 6 November, citizen activist Wang Zheng established the Zhi Xian Party, which supports Communist Party rule but criticizes it failing to uphold the constitution. Bo Xilai was elected the party&#x27;s &quot;Chairman for life&quot;. Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau banned Zhi Xian Party on 2 December 2013 and Wang Zheng was later arrested in 2017.

Chinese authorities attempted but failed to confiscate Bo&#x27;s €6.95 million villa in Cannes, a key piece of evidence in his bribery charges, which had been purchased by Xu Ming and held by Xu&#x27;s girlfriend, former CCTV host Jiang Feng Dolby, a British citizen, as an intermediary for the Bo family. The villa was sold in 2015, but the identities of both the seller and the buyer remain unknown.

After Bo&#x27;s fall, Xi Jinping&#x27;s accession to power resulted in a series of major political changes with significant consequences. Bo&#x27;s former supporter Zhou Yongkang retired in 2012, but was caught up in Xi Jinping&#x27;s anti-corruption dragnet in 2013, detained for investigation, and eventually sentenced to life in prison. In addition, Zhou was unable to select the successor to his office, possibly as a result of his role in the Bo Xilai scandal. The head of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which Zhou headed, no longer held a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee following the 18th Party Congress, as the number of seats on the body were reduced from nine to seven. The anti-corruption campaign following the 18th Party Congress became the biggest of its kind in the history of China under Communist rule. By 2014, Bo had been branded by some media outlets outside of China as part of a so-called &quot;New Gang of Four&quot; composed of disgraced officials Zhou Yongkang, Xu Caihou, and Ling Jihua.

Bo&#x27;s chief ideological rival, former Guangdong party secretary Wang Yang, went on to become Vice-Premier in 2013 and eventually joined the Politburo Standing Committee in 2017, the party&#x27;s top leadership council. Wen Jiabao, who was seen as Bo&#x27;s foremost critic in the top leadership, suffered significant public embarrassment himself over a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about his family&#x27;s vast empire of wealth whose release coincided closely with Bo&#x27;s dismissal. Huang Qifan, the mayor of Chongqing long seen as an ally of Bo, continued serving in his position as Mayor of Chongqing until his resignation in 2016. Wang Lijun was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for defection, corruption, and abuse of power.

==Political alignment and affiliations==
In the course of his career, Bo Xilai was the beneficiary of considerable patronage from former Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin. He is thus associated with Jiang&#x27;s faction, sometimes referred to as the &quot;elitists&quot;, that is generally known to favor a model that emphasizes free trade, economic development in the coastal regions, and export-led growth. It is a coalition composed largely of &quot;princelings&quot; (the children of high-ranking former party leaders), business people, leaders of coastal cities, and members of the erstwhile &quot;Shanghai clique&quot;. By contrast, the &quot;populist&quot; coalition of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao advocated more balanced economic development and improvements to China&#x27;s social safety net. The populist faction comprised rural leaders, socialist intellectuals, and several leaders who rose to prominence through their connections with the Communist Youth League.

While Bo was initially identified with the elitist bloc during his time in Liaoning and as Minister of Commerce, during his tenure in the interior city of Chongqing, he adopted a number of populist policies typically associated with the conservative left. Namely, he implemented social housing programs, gave residency status (and therefore the associated social welfare benefits) to rural migrant workers, and emphasized a need for a more balanced distribution of wealth. Although Bo relentlessly pursued technology, capital, and business opportunities, he also spearheaded a large number of government programs to help the working class and disadvantaged groups. Bo&#x27;s campaigns against corruption also allegedly seized the assets of private entrepreneurs, in turn allegedly funneling these funds into his own personal wealth, as well as (more publicly) state projects and welfare programs, effectively re-asserting state control over wealth. He also sought to promote &quot;red culture&quot;, and mandated the revival of Mao-era slogans and songs, evoking memories that were romantic to the conservative left, but painful to the liberal right of Chinese politics.

Bo&#x27;s policies in Chongqing ultimately made him a prominent figure among neo-Maoists and leftists, and a representative of the conservative wing of the Communist Party. Although Bo did not favor the discontinuation of market economics or a return to Mao-era policies, he was seen to advocate a strong role for the state in peoples&#x27; lives. Bo&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign, in particular, earned him a reputation for heavy-handedness and authoritarian methods in crime and punishment. Bo&#x27;s policies put him in opposition to the more liberal and reform-oriented faction, particularly Premier Wen Jiabao and Guangdong party secretary Wang Yang, who favored the strengthening of rule of law and a continuation of political reform. To observers, Bo and Wang&#x27;s verbal jousting over the future direction of development marked an increasing polarization of Chinese politics into leftist and reformer camps.

==Personal life==

=== First marriage ===
Bo&#x27;s first wife was Li Danyu, an army surgeon and daughter of the Chinese politician Li Xuefeng. The two met in 1975, when Bo was working as a manual laborer at a factory in Beijing. They wed in September 1976 and had a son the following year, Li Wangzhi, born Bo Wangzhi, who also goes by Brendan or Brandon Li, and Li Xiaobai.

In 1978, the &quot;gaokao&quot; was re-instated and Bo Xilai was admitted to Peking University, where Gu Kailai was also a student. On their son&#x27;s fourth birthday, June 20, 1981, Bo surprised Li by asking for a divorce. Li refused, but moved out of their home at Zhongnanhai. The case went to court and the divorce was completed in 1984. Gu, in a book she wrote, said she met Bo in 1984 in Dalian, but Li claimed in their divorce case that Bo had been in an affair with Gu after the two met at Peking University. After the divorce, Li did not stay in contact with Bo and insisted that their son change his surname from Bo to Li.

In 1990, when Bo Yibo retired, Li Wangzhi moved into Zhongnanhai to live with his grandfather; he rarely saw his father, Bo Xilai, and barely associated with him during the latter&#x27;s political heyday. In 1996, Li graduated from Peking University Law School with an LLB degree and in 2003 from Columbia University&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs with a master&#x27;s degree in international affairs. He was then hired by Citigroup, before becoming a businessman, active in Dalian and Beijing. He founded an investment company named &quot;Chong&#x27;er&quot; and adopted the pseudonym &quot;Xiaobai&quot;. Historically, Chong&#x27;er, the son of Duke Xian of Jin during the Spring and Autumn period, fled his home after being persecuted by his father&#x27;s concubine and her son, both of whom eventually died in court infighting and Chong&#x27;er returned to take power as Duke Wen of Jin. Xiaobai, the brother of Duke Xiang of Qi during the same era, also fled his home to avoid the chaos under his brother&#x27;s rule. After Duke Xiang of Qi was assassinated by a minister, Xiaobai returned for the throne, becoming Duke Huan of Qi.

In early 2007, Gu Kailai fainted at Bo Yibo&#x27;s funeral, which Li Wangzhi also attended. Doctors later informed her that the cordyceps capsules she had been taking were poisoned by lead and mercury. Gu was convinced that Li Wangzhi poisoned her and reported to the Beijing police, only to be dismissed. In late 2007, Xu Ming recommended Wang Lijun to Gu to handle the case, which became known as &quot;12/06 Special Case&quot; as on December 6, 2007, Wang established a task force, which soon arrested Gu&#x27;s driver and another staff member, both were detained in Shenyang for five years without trial and were only released after the Neil Heywood case came to light. In October 2011, Bo Xilai relayed Gu&#x27;s suspicions that his eldest son had poisoned her to Li Danyu&#x27;s older brother, Li Xiaoxue, who is married to Gu&#x27;s older sister. Li Xiaoxue dismissed the suspicions, and Bo was reassured. Both Li Danyu and her son denied the allegations of poisoning Gu. Besides the &quot;12/06 Special Case&quot;, after Li Wangzhi married the daughter of a Dalian entrepurneur, Gu reportedly pressured Bo to undermine the company of Li&#x27;s father-in-law and revoke its import-export rights.

Li remarked publicly that his father&#x27;s arrest &quot;destroyed his life&quot;. In August 2013, he attended the opening session of Bo&#x27;s trial, while Bo&#x27;s second son, Bo Guagua, was absent, remaining in the United States. It was the first time Li saw his father after the feneral of his grandfather in 2007. At the trial, Bo referred to his eldest son as &quot;Bo Wangzhi&quot;: &quot;Gu Kailai went to great lengths to convince me that Bo Guagua was capable, while Bo Wangzhi was not.&quot; Bo also expressed regret over their six-year alienation caused by the &quot;12/06 Special Case&quot;, during which he was unaware that Li had gotten married and had a child.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2015, Li Wangzhi published a post on Weibo, which was censored afterwards, revealing his father&#x27;s condition in prison: &quot;His health is okay; despite the limited conditions, he can receive treatment when needed.&quot; Li also shared: A year ago, around this time, my father and I spoke face-to-face for the first time in seven years. His first words to me were: &quot;The materials accusing you of poisoning Kailai and me are in the cabinet behind me, this thick (gesturing about a foot). I never believed any of it.&quot; I couldn&#x27;t hold back my tears.

But it was this fabricated so-called &quot;12/06 Special Case&quot; that implicated numerous individuals from the Beijing and Chongqing Public Security Bureaus, as well as the Central Guard Bureau, separating father and son as if between life and death. To this day, the case remains unresolved, with no one held accountable. Those who created and spread the case have neither clarified the truth nor apologized. Aren&#x27;t both my father and I victims of this case?

In 2014, remarkably, I saw him more often than in any other year I can recall in the past 30 years, which brought me great warmth. I took every opportunity to visit him, and I hope, within the bounds of the law, to have more chances to do so. After all, life is short. Sometimes I reflect: if I don&#x27;t see him at a funeral, it&#x27;s in a courtroom or a prison. Is that a blessing or a tragedy? One can&#x27;t help but feel at the mercy of fate.

=== Second marriage ===
Bo&#x27;s second wife is Gu Kailai, a prominent lawyer. Gu&#x27;s father, Gu Jingsheng, was a Communist revolutionary. Her mother, Fan Chengxiu, was a descendant of the renowned Song dynasty chancellor and poet Fan Zhongyan. Bo and Gu were schoolmates at Peking University, and according to Li Danyu, Bo&#x27;s first wife, Bo had an affair with Gu at the time. According to Gu, however, she first met Bo in Dalian in 1984. The two married in 1986 and had a son, Bo Guagua, in 1987, after which Gu founded the Kailai Law Firm in Dalian. In 1995, the firm relocated its headquarters to Beijing and closed its Dalian branch in 1999. In 2001, it was renamed Beijing Angdao Law Firm.

The couple drew criticism for using Bo&#x27;s political clout to further the interests of his wife and her law firm. Jiang Weiping claimed that Gu served as Bo&#x27;s &quot;gatekeeper&quot; when Bo was the mayor of Dalian, regularly accepting gifts and bribes from property developers seeking access to him, and from party officials seeking government appointments. Bo denied that his wife had profited from his position, saying that his wife had retired her legal practice while the couple lived in Dalian in the 1990s. Gu left for Britain with their son in December 1999, out of spite after discovering that Bo had an affair. She lived there primarily until 2007 and reportedly experienced a change in temperament after returning to China, staying at home without working and becoming increasingly paranoid and isolated. According to Bo Guagua, Wang Lijun secretly poisoned Gu &quot;to keep her in a weakened state&quot; in Chongqing. There was also speculation that Bo may have attempted to interfere with a corruption investigation into his wife prior to the Wang Lijun incident, which led to the downfall of the couple. In August 2012, Gu was convicted of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood after a dispute over money which purportedly escalated until he threatened her son&#x27;s life. She was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, which was commuted to life imprisonment in 2015.

Bo and Gu&#x27;s son, Bo Guagua, attended Harrow School from 2001 to 2006, before going on to gain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Balliol College, Oxford in 2010, a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Harvard Kennedy School in 2012, and a JD degree from Columbia Law School in 2016. Bo Guagua&#x27;s high-profile and privileged lifestyle attracted media attention in China and beyond. Both Guagua and his father had repeatedly denied allegations that Guagua was the &quot;playboy&quot; that he was often portrayed. Asked how he could afford his son&#x27;s tuition fees on his estimated annual salary of $22,000, Bo replied that his son received &quot;full scholarships&quot; from the respective institutions. However, the veracity of this assertion has been questioned by several sources.

From around 2010 to late 2011, Bo Guagua dated Sabrina Chen Xiaodan, the granddaughter of Chen Yun. Bo Guagua has not returned to China since his parents&#x27; arrests in 2012, but his passport was renewed by the Chinese government in 2016. After law school, he has lived in Canada. From late 2016 to early 2021, he worked as a business analyst for the Power Corporation owned by the Desmarais family, who have maintained close ties to the Bo family. In 2024, he married Deffany Hsu Hui-yü, his schoolmate at Columbia University and the granddaughter of Hsu Wen-cheng, a Kuomintang politician and the founder of Luodong Bo-ai Hospital in Yilan County, Taiwan. The couple held a wedding banquet in Hsinchu County, Taiwan in November of that year. At the wedding, he paid tribute to his parents for &quot;making sacrifices for the people and the greater good&quot; and &quot;endur[ing] fabricated crimes with grace.&quot;

=== Affairs ===
Bo has a reputation of a womanizer, who is said to have had more than 100 girlfriends, favouring celebrities and television hosts. His womanising is said to push his wife, Gu, into relying on a circle of close confidants, including Patrick Henri Devillers, Larry Cheng, Neil Heywood, and Wang Lijun, usually leading to speculation about romantic relationships. In September 2012, Xinhua News Agency&#x27;s official announcement of Bo&#x27;s expulsion from the CCP cited, among other charges, that &quot;Bo had affairs and maintained improper sexual relationships with a number of women.&quot; In 2013, Bo admitted during his trial that he had been unfaithful to his wife, which drove her to take away their son, Bo Guagua, to England.

According to Jiang Weiping, during Bo&#x27;s time in Dalian in the 1990s, he was said to maintain two high-end hotel rooms for liaisons with his mistresses, who were compensated with jobs and favors. Taiwanese-American businessman Larry Cheng, a confidant of Gu, revealed that when Bo was having an affair with Zhang Weijie, a hostess at Dalian TV, Gu once called Cheng, saying she couldn&#x27;t sleep and was weeping uncontrollably. Zhang, one of Bo&#x27;s best-known mistresses, disappeared in the late 1990s and has since become the subject of gossip and urban legend, with some speculating that Gu murdered her after Zhang became pregnant with Bo&#x27;s child. Jiang Weiping instead claimed that Zhang was forced out of Dalian by Gu and financially compensated by Wu Wenkang, Bo&#x27;s secretary at the time, after which she studied at the Beijing Film Academy and eventually emigrated overseas.

Bo was romantically linked to actress Ma Xiaoqing, who had admitted in interviews prior to Bo&#x27;s fall that she had been in a relationship with a high-ranking official. In 2012, an American website Boxun baselessly reported that movie star Zhang Ziyi was paid $100 million to sleep with Bo and other top Chinese officials, a claim that was widely reposted. Zhang sued Boxun in a US court for defamation. In December 2013, Boxun settled the case with Zhang and issued an apology. Zhang also sued Next Media in Hong Kong and Taiwan over the similar reports by the group&#x27;s two titles, both citing Boxun. She won the case in Hong Kong but lost in Taiwan.

== Popular culture ==
In the Chinese TV series &quot;Uphold Justice in America&quot; (2002), based on the book of the same name by Gu Kailai, Bo is played by Pu Cunxin.

In the US film &quot;The Laundromat&quot; (2019), Bo is played by Jesse Wang.

<text>Lucida Sans Unicode is an OpenType typeface from the design studio of Bigelow &amp; Holmes, designed to support the most commonly used characters defined in version 1.0 of the Unicode standard. It is a sans-serif variant of the Lucida font family and supports Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Hebrew scripts, as well as all the characters used in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

It is the first Unicode encoded font to include non-Latin scripts (Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew). It was designed by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow in 1993, and was first shipped with the Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 operating system.

The font comes pre-installed with all Microsoft Windows versions since Windows 98. A nearly identical font, called Lucida Grande, shipped as the default system font with Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X operating system, until switching to Helvetica Neue in 2014 with OS X Yosemite; Lucida Grande added support for Arabic and Thai scripts.

Letters in the International Phonetic Alphabet, particularly upside down letters, are aligned for easy reading upside down. Thus, the font is among the most ideal for upside-down text, compared to other Unicode typefaces, which have the turned &quot;t&quot; and &quot;h&quot; characters aligned with their tops at the base line and thus appear out of line.

The typeface has a flaw in the combining low line character (U+0332) and the combining double low line character (U+0333), which are rendered as a blank or as a simple tiny underline when font-size is less than 238 point or so in word processors.

Other well-known Unicode fonts include Code2000, Arial Unicode MS, and the various Free software Unicode typefaces.

<doc id="528163" wikidata="Q123630" url="?curid=528163" title="Law of Russia">
<text>The primary and fundamental statement of laws in the Russian Federation is the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Statutes, like the Russian Civil Code and the Russian Criminal Code, are the predominant legal source of Russian laws.

==Hierarchy==
===Constitutionism===
Adopted by national referendum on 12 December 1993 with 54.5% of the vote, the Constitution took effect on the day it was published – 25 December of the same year. It set out the fundamentals of government as well as proclaiming the rule of law, the ideological neutrality of the state, political pluralism, competitive elections and a separation of power, guaranteeing fundamental human rights to the Russian people. The Constitution establishes a semi-presidential system that encompasses strong executive power and increased independence for the president. Since its adoption in a 1993 referendum the Russian Constitution is considered to be the supreme law of the land. Article 15 of the Constitution reads that it &quot;shall have supreme legal force and have direct effect, and shall be applicable throughout the entire territory of the Russian Federation.&quot; Courts are guided by the Constitution and it trumps federal and local laws.

====Amendments====
Few amendments have been made to the Constitution since its adoption. The most significant of these was made in 2008. It concerned the term of office to be held by the President of the Russian Federation, which was increased from four to six years.

== Presidential System of the Russian Federation ==
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation came into being as an independent state in 1991 and it is described as a &quot;democratic, federal, rule-based republic&quot; in its constitution which is adopted in 1993, includes many universal principles such as human rights and freedoms, free elections, political and ideological pluralism and judicial independence. According to the Constitution of Russia, the President of Russia is head of the state, and of a multi-party system with executive power exercised by the government, headed by the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the President with the parliament&#x27;s approval. Legislative power is vested in the two houses of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, while the President and the government issue numerous legally binding by-laws. However, even some academics who accept that Russia has a constitutional semi-presidential model, describe the system as &quot;presidential&quot; and even &quot;super presidential&quot; due to the strong and central position of the president.

===Constitutional laws===
Constitutional laws cannot become part of the constitution or amend parts of it absent a special legal act on constitutional amendment. They are typically enacted in important areas of constitutional law, such as Article 56 which allows for the passage of the constitutional laws necessitated by a state of emergency

===Statutes===
Statutes are the predominant legal source of Russian law, and may only be enacted through the legislative process. Codes are the basis for law on a matter, and they are usually supplemented with legislation to develop certain provisions. There are gaps in some of the codes, but even so the judges will find a basis for deciding the case in a given code. Codes are interpreted flexibly, and interpretation may be based on enumeration of &quot;general principles&quot; of the codes. General principles are usually articulated at the beginning of the codes in the first chapter to outline the reason for the legislation. Reasoning by analogy is also allowed.

The Civil Code of Russia is the &quot;constitution&quot; of the market economy, and is special in the hierarchy of codes, since it will supplant contradictory text in other codes. New codes and laws supersede old ones, unless a statute expressly preserves the old law.

The Criminal Code of Russia (UGKRF, 63-ФЗ) is the penal statute. It lays out conduct impermissible in Russia. The first and most recent UGKRF came into force on 1 January 1997. On 8 January 1997, President Yeltsin signed the Criminal Correctional Code to regulate the conditions of the sentences. The new Criminal Code replaced the Soviet analogue of 1960. The main changes deal with economic crimes and property crimes.

===Sub-laws===
====Presidential decrees and directives====
The President has power to issue normative and non-normative decrees, provided they do not contravene the constitution and federal laws. &quot;On the basis and for the sake of implementation of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, federal laws, normative decrees of the President of the Russian Federation&quot; Government may also issue directives having &quot;normative&quot; character.

====Agency regulations====
Agencies may enact regulations through their general competency, but these are limited to the extent of the constitution and relevant codes. If these limits are not strictly defined, then the president may use agencies to get around the legislative process. Consequently, agencies may have their powers limited by statutes. The Civil Code purposely authorizes supplementary rules by &quot;statute&quot; rather than the broader term &quot;legislation&quot; which could encompass other secondary law.

===Judicial decisions, judicial practice and explanations of supreme courts===
Russia is a civil law country; and, strictly speaking, decisions rendered by courts are not binding on other courts. However, the lower courts generally follow the principles established by the supreme courts. Moreover, according to Art.308.8 of the Code of Procedure in Commercial Courts, the Supreme Court can set aside a decision of a lower court on the grounds that this decision contravenes uniformity in interpretation of law as established by case law. In practice, but not in theory, precedents of the higher courts are becoming an important Russian law.

===Judicial explanations of law===
The Russian Supreme Court has no authority to issue general &quot;explanations&quot; of the substantive law and procedural issues, absent a relevant &quot;case or controversy&quot; in front of them. Legal scholars also take part in these discussions, and the opinions of the judges and commentators are published and used as persuasive authority. This process is somewhat analogous to the discussion that scholars take in &quot;American Law Reports&quot; or in law reviews. The judges and scholars may codify what is practice, or more importantly address new issues of law to the lower courts and instruct them how to interpret these issues. The texts of the explanations of the law are published, and cited by many courts. In contrast, only selected judicial opinions are published. It is not clear which explanations are binding to lower courts, as there is a tension between the Constitution and federal law versus guiding explanatory principles. Still, lower courts that ignore relevant explanations will probably get reversed.

===Judicial review of laws for constitutionality by the constitutional court===
Judicial Review allows courts to declare unconstitutional laws void. Constitutional Courts are therefore negative legislators. The interpretations of the constitution in the decisions of the Constitutional Court are also authoritative and binding on the political branches. The ordinary or lower courts may also apply judicial review. Courts of general jurisdiction may decline to apply (1) any law that violates the Constitution and (2) any normative regulations, in particular subordinate regulations that contravene statutes. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation has jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of regulations issued by government agencies. The Supreme Court has held that lower courts must evaluate the contents of applicable laws or other normative acts for their conformity to the constitution, and to apply the constitution where they conflict.

===Other sources===
====USSR legislation====
USSR legislation fills gaps as the new system is being put in place, and is purely transitional until the Russian parliament can add new laws. It cannot contradict legislative acts of RF.

====Analogy====
Judges often reason by analogy, using the general principles of the law the codes to interpret provisions broadly.

====Legal consciousness, natural law, good faith and general principles====
Judges don&#x27;t rely on natural law, but rather legal positivism combined with general principles of law. They may rely on &quot;the requirements of good faith, reasonableness, and justice since Civil Code and other codes tell specific principles within the code. Other principles are equity and fairness, general principles of law, etc.

====Custom====
The Russian Civil Code explicitly mentions custom as a separate source of law. Traditions may establish rules of decision where there is no dispositive language in statute or other written law.

====Academic commentary====
Individual scholars may be influential by drafting legislation or debating proposed legislation. Unlike in some civil-law systems, academic treatises or learned commentary is not considered a separate source of law or cited by judges, but judges and attorney rely on it for their arguments.

====International law====
All international law and the international treaties of the Russian Federation are part of Russian domestic legal system. Domestic law gives way to international law according to Article 15 of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has the greatest expertise in applying international law.

==Type of legal system==
During the Soviet period, Russian law was considered to be socialist law. Since the fall of the Soviet Union that is no longer the case, and most scholars have classified the Russian legal system as a civil law system. However, there are problems with this new classification (similar to the ones that plagued Russia&#x27;s classification as a socialist law country). Some legal branches could be considered as the mix of civil law and common law. For, example civil procedural law is considered by Dmitry Maleshin as a mix of civil law and common law.

==Publications==
The Constitution of Russia instructs the president either to reject the laws passed by parliament, or to sign and publish them.

The Constitution of Russia and the Federal Law &quot;On the Procedure for the Publication and Entry into Force of Federal Constitutional Laws, Federal Laws, Acts of the Chambers of the Federal Assembly&quot; dated 14.06.1994 No. 5-FZ establish that laws that have not been officially published are not applied.

Federal laws, federal constitutional laws and acts (usually resolutions) of the chambers of Parliament are subject to publication. International treaties ratified by the Parliament are published together with the laws on ratification.

Laws are published within 7 days after being signed by the President and come into force after another 10 days, unless otherwise provided in the law itself.

The official publication of the law in Russia is the first publication of the full text:

* in the &quot;Parliamentary Newspaper&quot; () — the official printing body of the Federal Assembly;
* in Rossiyskaya Gazeta () — the official publication of the government;
* in the &quot;Collection of Legislation of the Russian Federation&quot; ();
* on the Official Internet portal of legal information (www.pravo.gov.ru) () (since 2011).

==Legal education==
Legal education has traditionally begun with the specialist degree in law ().

<doc id="528175" wikidata="Q6412798" url="?curid=528175" title="Kingmaker scenario">
<text>In game theory, a kingmaker scenario in a game of three or more players is an situation where a player who is unable to win has the capacity to determine which player among others will win. This player is referred to as the &quot;kingmaker&quot; or &quot;spoiler&quot;. No longer playing for themselves, they may make game decisions to favor a player who played more favorably (to them) earlier in the game. Except in games where interpersonal politics, by design, play a decisive role, this is undesirable.

==Gladiator example==

Consider this simple game: Three gladiators are playing, with strengths 3, 4, 5. In each turn, each gladiator must &quot;engage&quot; another, and they begin &quot;combat&quot;. The result of combat is that the weaker player is eliminated, and the stronger player loses strength equal to that of the weaker player. (For example, if &quot;5&quot; attacks &quot;3&quot;, &quot;3&quot; will die and &quot;5&quot; will have strength 2.) The winning gladiator is the last one standing.

Each round of combat eliminates one gladiator, so there will be two rounds of combat. The first round of combat will eliminate one participant and weaken the other to a strength no greater than 2. The nonparticipant&#x27;s strength is at least 3, so they are guaranteed to win the second round of combat, and the entire contest. Therefore, the game collapses: The winning gladiator is the one not involved in the first battle.

Hence, the gladiator whose turn comes first is the kingmaker. They must be involved in the first battle, hence cannot win, but with the liberty of choosing their opponent in that battle, can elect either of the other two players to be the winner of the contest.

==In practice==

Because they allow the outcome of the game to be determined by a player of (presumably) inferior strategy, kingmaker scenarios are usually considered undesirable, although to some extent they may be unavoidable in strategy games. Of course the argument can be made that this means the winner, chosen by the kingmaker, played with the additional restriction of not annoying the other players as much, presumably a more difficult task. In these games, the game mechanics, players&#x27; outcomes and strategies are often so interconnected that to eliminate all possibilities of this situation is almost impossible.

In tournament situations where, for instance, only a few teams proceed to the next round, a player who is already guaranteed to proceed can experience a situation similar to a kingmaker.
They can sometimes influence who of the remaining players comes in second (when 2 players proceed). For such a player it can be profitable to make sure the weakest player proceeds, because this reduces his competition in subsequent rounds. However, this is often seen as undesirable because it conflicts with the concept that the strongest few are allowed to proceed to the next round.

Different games deal with the kingmaker problem in different ways:

* In the 2002 board game &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, players conceal their victory point totals. This makes it unclear (unless players are especially attentive) which player is in the lead.
* By introducing randomness, games can make sure that everyone in the game still has a chance of winning the game, no matter how bad their situation may be. Obscuring victory points can also accomplish this, for not knowing whether one can still win can have the same effect as still having a chance to win. For example, in the group stages of tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, the final set of games in the group are often played at the same time. This results in fewer situations where one team has no chance of proceeding.
* Games can have rules that eliminate players who have no chance of winning the game, so they can not influence the game further (poker and Risk are examples of this).
* Games, especially in a tournament setting, can attribute value to places other than the first place. The potential kingmaker would be able to play for their own benefit even if they can no longer win. In the example of the gladiators, if the gladiator with strength 4 has to be involved in the first round, they will choose the gladiator with strength 3 as opponent instead of being indifferent.
* Most games prohibit—with penalties greater than match loss (for example, ostracism, disqualification)—questionable or unsportsmanlike conduct geared toward effecting a kingmaker scenario.
** Stalling, or intentionally slowing game play in timed games, for personal advantage or to that of a currently leading player, is normally treated as unsportsmanlike conduct.
** The use of revokes, or intentional rules violations, in trick-taking card games, to void a round and effect a kingmaker scenario is discouraged by use of severe penalties. In tournaments, doing this can be classified as cheating.
*In the later rounds of a tournament, the rules permit a player to concede defeat for any reason other than bribery. Many players follow a practice of conceding to &quot;anyone&quot; who has a strong chance of winning one of the eight playoff spots, thereby avoiding as far as possible even the appearance of engaging in unsportsmanlike collusion with any party in preference over any other.
*In chess, the FIDE handbook recommends drawing lots such that players of the same national chess federation do not meet in the last few rounds. In the Candidates Tournament for example, players of the same national federation are made to play each other in the first round.

Other games may explicitly encourage a kingmaker scenario. An example of this is the television series Survivor, where the last seven to ten contestants voted out form a jury that chooses a winner from the final two contestants.

Game designer Cole Wehrle has defended the practice of kingmaking, arguing that kingmaking offers a &quot;powerful narrative tool.&quot; Wehrle argues that since the practice of kingmaking encourages players to consider their relationship with other factions in the game, it allows players to tell complex stories and consider the broader consequences of their actions--for instance, a player must consider whether betraying another faction would lead to that faction choosing another player to win later. Wehrle acknowledges that this goes against typical notions of fairness that are expected in games, but argues that storytelling may take precedence over fairness in some designs. Wehrle used these ideas in several of his designs, including Root, John Company, and Oath.

<doc id="528180" wikidata="Q2188266" url="?curid=528180" title="Freeter">
<text>In Japan, a is a person aged 18 to 34 who is unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise lacks full-time paid employment. The term excludes housewives and students.

Freeters do not start a career after high school or university, but instead earn money from low-paid jobs.

The word &quot;freeter&quot; or &quot;freeta&quot; is thought to be a portmanteau of the English word &quot;free&quot; (or perhaps &quot;freelance&quot;) and the German word &quot;Arbeiter&quot; (&quot;labourer&quot;). &quot;Arubaito&quot; is a Japanese loanword from &quot;Arbeiter&quot;, and perhaps from &quot;Arbeit&quot; (&quot;work&quot;). As German (along with English) was used in Japanese universities before World War II, especially for science and medicine, &quot;arubaito&quot; became common among students to describe part-time work for university students.

This term was coined by part-time job magazine &quot;From&quot; &quot;A&quot; editor Michishita Hiroshi in 1987 and was used to depict a &quot;free&quot; worker that worked less hours, earned pay hourly instead of a monthly paycheck like regular full time workers, and received none of the benefits of a regular full time worker (holiday pay, sick pay, bonus pay, paid leave).

The meaning of the term switched connotations from positive to negative after the Japanese asset price bubble broke resulting in a recession in the 1990s. In the 1980s, the term was seen in a positive light signifying the freedom to explore other alternative options for employment for fun when the economy of Japan was prosperous with many different job opportunities. In the 1990s and 2000s, the term switched to a negative connotation and Freeters were seen as burdens on society.

==History==
The increase of Freeters in the 1990s and 2000s is associated with the subsequent rapid changes that the nation has undergone since the bursting of the economic bubble at the beginning of the 1990s and the increasing neoliberalization of the economy. The almost two decade recession urged companies to change their workforce policies to stay relevant in the global market. Companies halted hiring graduates for permanent employment, rolled back bonuses, incentivized senior employees to retire, and created a strong policy of hiring temporary staff for more flexibility and company savings with over a third of the workforce moving onto contractual work.

The relaxation of protective labor laws and the deregulation of recruitment practices in 1998 allowed companies to employ larger numbers of flexible workers for longer periods of time.

The increase in private secondary schools is leading to a lower number of public school students getting enrolled into elite universities resulting in more demand for part-time work as full-time work is becoming less available to public school graduates.

About 10% of high school and university graduates could not find steady employment in the spring of 2000, and a full 50% of those who could find a job left within three years after employment. The employment situation is worse for the youngest freeters.

From 2000 to 2009, the number of freeters increased rapidly. In 1982 there were an estimated 0.5 million freeters in Japan, 0.8 million in 1987, 1.01 million in 1992 and 1.5 million in 1997. The number for 2001 is 4.17 million freeters according to one estimate, and 2 million in 2002 according to another estimate.

Many Japanese people worry about the future impact of freeters on society. If they work at all, freeters often work at convenience stores, supermarkets, fast food outlets, restaurants, and other low paying jobs. According to a survey by the Japan Institute of Labor in 2000, the average freeter works 4.9 days per week and earns ¥139,000 per month (ca. $1,300 U.S.). Two thirds of freeters have never had a regular, full-time job.

The rise of internet business has allowed some freeters to work from home and be self-employed. Some experts predict that Japan&#x27;s aging population will create a labor shortage that will increase career options for freeters.

==Causes==
The Japan Institute of Labor classifies freeters into three groups: the &quot;&quot;moratorium&quot; type&quot; that wants to wait before starting a career, the &quot;&quot;dream pursuing&quot; type&quot;, and the &quot;&quot;no alternative&quot; type&quot;. 
*The &quot;moratorium&quot; type of freeter wants to enjoy life, and deliberately chooses not to join the rat race of the Japanese work environment.
*The &quot;dream pursuing&quot; type has specific dreams incompatible with a standard Japanese career.
*The &quot;no alternative&quot; type could not find a decent job before high school or university graduation in the system called , which is unique to Japanese society. Those left behind by &quot;Shinsotsu-Ikkatsu-Saiyō&quot; are forced to take low paying irregular jobs. This usually has to do with their dropout status from previous educational institutes. Those who dropped out of high school have the worst prospects.

==Effects==

===Difficulties starting their own household===
Many freeters live for free with their parents as what is described by some media outlets as parasite singles. Parents in Japan usually do not force their offspring out of the house. Once the parents die, the children will have to pay for their housing themselves. Even if they inherit the house or apartment, they still have to bear the costs of ownership.

Japanese housing is compact, and is too small for two families. If freeters want to marry, then they have to find their own housing, usually at their own expense.

Women have fewer financial incentives to marry (such as salary increases) than men do, and women are traditionally seen as the caregivers of older family members, which is becoming increasingly difficult due to the growing number of senior citizens. If women marry, then the burden gets doubled with them having to take care of their parents, spouse&#x27;s parents, husband, and potential children. These issues, along with wanting to work for money and not marrying may lead to stigmas of being not only parasite singles but also &quot;unfeminine&quot;.

Work and marriage are seen as the two main identifiers for adulthood and are the normative ideals of masculinity. Men deal with comparisons to the salaryman, also known as a &quot;corporate warrior&quot;, the idolized ideal job for men during economic growth from the 1960s associated with Japan&#x27;s rebuilding of its nation and economy after WWII. The dominant masculine hegemonic discourse of the 1960s and after of the ideal man being self-sacrificing for work and the bread winner of the family has created a stigma where male freeters are seen less masculine and have a harder time with relationships, marriage, and eventually finding full-time work. Many men have seen their fathers in salaryman positions and do not want to fulfill that role because they want to spend more time with family and focus on hobbies.

===Difficulties starting a career===
Starting a career becomes more difficult the longer somebody is a freeter, as Japanese companies prefer to hire new workers fresh out of high school or university. While the employment situation is changing, large traditional companies still see a new employee as a lifetime investment. They much prefer to hire a young person who offers a longer period of service, and who will be easier to mold.

Often the only option left for freeters is to continue working at low income part-time jobs, making it difficult to establish their own household. Some join the many homeless in Japan.

===Health and pension insurance===
Part-time jobs usually do not include any health or retirement benefits. Freeters&#x27; low income makes payment of medical expenses onerous.

The biggest problem for freeters is that the Japanese pension system is based on the number of years a person has paid into the system. The freeter usually has little or no pension insurance or savings, which may force him or her to work beyond the usual retirement age.

Japan faces the problem of an aging population. The pension system will be under increasing strain as the ratio of pensioners to workers increases.

===Freedom of choice===
The advantage of being a freeter is that one has more freedom of choice, and more time for hobbies, volunteering, and community service. If they are living with their parents, they can spend their entire income on themselves.

===Effect on Japanese society===

Freeters lack the benefits of union membership, which would give them some legal protection against firing.

While they are young, freeters commonly live with their parents and have disposable income that would otherwise go towards rent. Their spending helps the manufacturing sector of the Japanese economy.

By living in the same house as their parents and often not owning a car, freeters have a much lower impact on the natural environment than &quot;high consumption&quot; members of society owning cars.

Large numbers of workers trying to start careers in their thirties may have a significant impact on the current corporate culture of Japan. It may change hiring and employment practices, particularly since demographers predict a future labor shortage due to the Japan&#x27;s aging population.

Many male freeters have difficulties marrying because of their low income. They may thus have children later in life, or not at all. This will further aggravate the low birth rate in Japan and compound social and economic problems related to the aging population, such as underfunding of the Japanese pension system. As of today, freeters pay little or no money into the pension system.

The Japanese government has established a number of offices called &quot;Young Support Plaza&quot; to help young people find jobs. These offices offer basic training for job hunting: teaching young people how to write a résumé, and how to conduct themselves during interviews. The demand for their services has been fairly low so far.

== Freeters in popular culture and mass media ==
Starting in the 1980s, television shows romanticized the role of Freeters in programs like &quot;Shomuni&quot;. Freeters in popular culture are mainly depicted as women and the jobs shown are of more prestigious freelance work like anime illustrating or software development, largely ignoring men, fast food workers, and other service-oriented jobs.

Mass media either portrays Freeters as lazy and irresponsible youth or casualties of the economic problems of corporate restructuring and recession. These issues are still being disputed among various media platforms.

<doc id="528186" wikidata="Q56655" url="?curid=528186" title="Lygon Street">
<text>Lygon Street is located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, running through the inner northern suburbs of Carlton, Carlton North, Princes Hill and Brunswick East. Lygon Street is synonymous with the Italian community of Melbourne, forming the nexus point of Little Italy. It is home to many Italian restaurants and alfresco cafés.

==Geography==

Lygon Street runs north–south through the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne. At its southernmost end, it connects to Russell Street in the Hoddle Grid; it then proceeds northward, through Carlton, Carlton North, and Brunswick East, to its intersection with Albion Street. Although the roadway itself continues, it is renamed Holmes Street for the stretch between Albion Street and Moreland Road, and later renamed again to Nicholson Street for the stretch between Moreland Road and the street&#x27;s terminus at Bell Street. (Note that this is not continuous with the Nicholson Street which runs through the Melbourne CBD, Fitzroy, Carlton and Brunswick East.) North of Park Street, the street numbers restart at 1.

Tram routes 1 and 6 run along Lygon Street between Elgin Street, Carlton, and Albion Street, Brunswick East.

==Italian restaurant district==

The Italian restaurant district synonymous with Lygon Street occupies the few blocks between Queensberry Street and Elgin Street in Carlton. It is populated by the Italian families which migrated here in the 1950s, and holds the record of being the first place to install an espresso machine in Australia. It is also considered the birthplace of the &#x27;Aussie&#x27; pizza. The area is heavily European in nature, and is the home of the yearly Lygon Street Festa, one of Australia&#x27;s largest outdoor street festivals. The La Mama Theatre and Courthouse Theatre are also in this area, as is the heritage-listed neon sign at Borsari&#x27;s Corner, named after Italian cyclist Nino Borsari, on the corner of Grattan Street. Toto&#x27;s Pizza House, the first pizzeria established in Australia, has been located at the southern end of Lygon Street continuously since its opening in 1961.

==Cinema Nova==

Cinema Nova is an independent cinema with 16 screens, that shows Australian, indie, and arthouse films. It was established in 1992, when the Longford Cinema in South Yarra and the Valhalla Cinema in Richmond and Westgarth collaborated to open it as a twin cinema. The cinema hosts film festivals such as Melbourne Queer Film Festival, Monster Fest, Melbourne Documentary Film Festival, and Transitions Film Festival.

Cinema Nova formerly sponsored the Cinema Nova Award for Best Fiction Short Film, an AACTA-accredited award worth cash, at the Melbourne International Film Festival, but the cinema has since dropped that sponsorship.

==Other points of interest==
The two blocks running between Grattan Street and Elgin Street are known for shopping and boutiques.

Melbourne Trades Hall occupies the corner of Lygon Street and Victoria Street.

Melbourne General Cemetery is situated on the western side of Lygon Street in North Carlton, between Cemetery Road and Macpherson Street.

The East Brunswick Club opened its doors as a music venue at the northern end of the street in May 2006.

Lygon Street was the main headquarters of an Italian Australian criminal organisation called The Carlton Crew.

<doc id="528190" wikidata="Q3372216" url="?curid=528190" title="Paul Soles">
<text>Paul Robert Soles (August 11, 1930 – May 26, 2021) was a Canadian character actor, voice artist and television personality. He voiced the title character in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1967), and portrayed Hermey in the 1964 television special &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;; Soles was one of the last surviving participants of the special&#x27;s voice cast.

Soles first screen appearance was on CFPL in 1953, and he continued to perform over 60 years later, performing as of 2016 in the comedy web series &quot;My 90-Year-Old Roommate&quot; on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s online comedy channel, CBC Comedy.

==Early life==
Soles was born in Toronto, the son of Lillian (Goodfellow) and Arthur L. Soles. His family were Jewish emigrants from Poland and Lithuania. He had two siblings.

Soles is the cousin of Bernard &quot;Bunny&quot; Cowan, and they both worked on the original 1960s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series and the 1967 children&#x27;s series &quot;Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse&quot;.

==Career==
===Acting roles===
Soles was the voice of Hermey the misfit elf in Rankin/Bass&#x27; &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; from 1964. He also voiced Marvel superhero Spider-Man and various characters in the original animated television series also from the 1960s, and he played &quot;The Lawbreaker&quot; on the CBC panel quiz show &quot;This Is the Law&quot; in the 1970s, and played Costas Stavros on the Canadian soap opera &quot;Riverdale&quot;. In 2001, Soles took over the role of Shylock the Jew in the Stratford Festival of Canada production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; after Al Waxman, who was originally scheduled to play the part, died. Soles played Stanley the pizza shop owner in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), and his other film appearances have included roles in &quot;Ticket to Heaven&quot; (1981), &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Gunrunner&quot; (1989) opposite Kevin Costner. He also played Danny, the Montreal Customs House janitor in the 2001 crime thriller &quot;The Score&quot;.

Soles won a 2006 Gemini Award for his role in the television series &quot;Terminal City&quot;, and a 2017 Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Digital Production for &quot;My 90-Year-Old Roommate&quot;. On the appointed evening of the awards ceremony, the ever-humble Soles was so overcome with emotion that he had to contain himself more than once on the way to the stage, resulting in another thunderous applause from the audience, before he accepted the trophy and gave his speech. 

===Voice work===
Soles also did voices on various animated television shows and films such as &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Smokey Bear Show&quot;, &quot;The Little Brown Burro&quot;, &quot;King of the Beasts&quot;, &quot;The Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, the original &quot;Spider-Man&quot; cartoon, &quot;The Trolls and the Christmas Express&quot;, &quot;Take Me Up to the Ball Game&quot;, &quot;Willy McBean and His Magic Machine&quot;, &quot;Festival of Family Classics&quot;, &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Circus&quot;, &quot;The Reluctant Dragon &amp; Mr. Toad Show&quot;, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Animals&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;The King Kong Show&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Woman&quot;.

Soles was also the narrator of &quot;The Wonderful Stories of Professor Kitzel&quot;, the voice of The Commissioner in the 2005 animated television series &quot;Funpak&quot; and has also supplied the voice of Dr. Reboux in the 2005 animated film version of the Johanna Spyri novel &quot;Heidi&quot;.

Soles also voiced the Academy Award-nominated animated documentary &quot;The Colours of My Father: A Portrait of Sam Borenstein&quot;.

In 2011, Soles started voicing the recurring character Maxwell Finnwich on &quot;Detentionaire&quot; and he voiced a character, Barnabas Dinklelot, in the 2017-2018 animated series, &quot;Mysticons&quot;.

===Television hosting===
He was the host of the short-lived CBC Television late-night comedy talk show &quot;Canada After Dark&quot;, and co-hosted the public affairs show &quot;Take 30&quot; for 18 seasons with hosts such as Anna Cameron and Adrienne Clarkson. He also hosted the CFPL television game show &quot;Take Your Choice&quot; for one year in the early 1960s.

===Documentary producer===
Paul Soles was also a producer of documentaries while he was an on-air talent at CFPL-TV in London, Ontario. He worked on a series called, &quot;The World Around Us&quot;, and travelled with film crews in Great Britain in the early 1960s, filming many aspects of British life. He even got on a soap-box in Hyde Park in London to speak his mind. Soles has worked with people like Dennis Goulden (a long-time documentarian who still produces television specials in the States) and Jim Plant and Tom Ashwell and Jon Boynton.

==Death==
Soles died of natural causes in his sleep at his home in Toronto, Ontario, on May 26, 2021, at the age of 90.

<doc id="528195" wikidata="Q966462" url="?curid=528195" title="North American T-2 Buckeye">
<text>The North American T-2 Buckeye was the United States Navy&#x27;s intermediate training aircraft, intended to introduce U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps student naval aviators and student naval flight officers to jets. It entered service in 1959, beginning the replacement process of the Lockheed T2V SeaStar, and was itself replaced by the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk in 2008.

==Design and development==
In 1956, the US Navy issued a requirement for a jet-powered basic trainer to replace its T-28 piston-engined aircraft. (Primary training for the US Navy remained the responsibility of the piston-engined Beechcraft T-34 Mentor while the jet-powered Lockheed T2V SeaStar provided more advanced training). North American Aviation won the US Navy&#x27;s competition for the new training aircraft in mid-1956 with its NA-241 design. North American&#x27;s design, designated the T2J-1 by the US Navy, was a mid-winged monoplane with trainee and instructor sitting in tandem on North American-built ejection seats, with the rear (instructor&#x27;s) seat raised to give a good view over the trainee&#x27;s head. The aircraft&#x27;s unswept wing&#x27;s structure was based on that of the FJ-1 Fury, while its control system was based on the T-28C. It was powered by a single Westinghouse J34-WE-46/48 turbojet, rated at . While it had no built-in armament, the T2J-1 could accommodate two .50-inch gun pods, practice bombs, or 2.75-inch rockets beneath the wings. The T-2&#x27;s performance was between that of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Cessna T-37 Tweet and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s TA-4J Skyhawk.

The first T2J-1 flew on 31 January 1958, and the type entered service with Basic Training Group Seven, soon to become VT-7 at Naval Air Station Meridian in 1959. A second training group, VT-9 formed at Meridian in 1961.

The first version of the aircraft entered service in 1959 as the T2J-1. It was redesignated the T-2A in 1962 under the joint aircraft designation system. The aircraft was subsequently redesigned, and the single engine was replaced with two Pratt &amp; Whitney J60-P-6 turbojets in the T-2B. The T-2C was fitted with two thrust General Electric J85-GE-4 turbojets. The T-2D and T-2E were export versions for the Venezuelan Air Force and Hellenic Air Force, respectively. The T-2 Buckeye (along with the TF-9J Cougar) replaced the T2V-1/T-1A SeaStar, though the T-1 continued in some uses into the 1970s.

All T-2 Buckeyes were manufactured by North American at Air Force Plant 85, located just south of Port Columbus Airport in Columbus, Ohio. A total of 609 aircraft were built during the production run. The name Buckeye refers to the state tree of Ohio, as well as the mascot of Ohio State University.

Every jet-qualified Naval Aviator and virtually every Naval Flight Officer from the late 1950s until 2004 received training in the T-2 Buckeye, a length of service spanning over four decades. The aircraft first exited the Naval Aviator strike pipeline (where it saw its final carrier landings) in 2004, and the Naval Flight Officer tactical jet pipeline in 2008. In the Naval Aviator strike pipeline syllabus and the Naval Flight Officer strike and strike fighter pipeline syllabi, the T-2 has been replaced by the near-sonic McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk (the U.S. Navy version of the BAE Systems Hawk), which is more comparable to other high-performance, subsonic trainers, or the supersonic U.S. Air Force Northrop T-38 Talon. More recently, the T-2 has been used as a director aircraft for aerial drones. Several T-2 Buckeyes, although still retaining their USN markings, are now registered as civilian-owned aircraft with FAA &quot;N&quot; numbers; they regularly appear at airshows.

<doc id="528199" wikidata="Q1316721" url="?curid=528199" title="Lychakiv Cemetery">
<text>Lychakiv Cemetery (; ), officially State History and Culture Museum-Preserve &quot;Lychakiv Cemetery&quot; (), is a historic cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine.

==History==
Since its creation in 1787 as Łyczakowski Cemetery, it has been the main necropolis of the city&#x27;s (at the time named Lemberg) intelligentsia, middle and upper classes. Initially the cemetery was located on several hills in the borough of Lychakiv, following the imperial Austro-Hungarian (the city was located in Austria-Hungary at the time) edict ordering that all cemeteries be moved outside of the city limits. The original project was prepared by , the head of the Lviv University botanical garden.

In mid-1850s the cemetery was expanded significantly by Tytus Tchórzewski, who created the present network of alleys and round-abouts. It then became the main city cemetery, and soon most other cemeteries were closed. The two largest that remained were the Yanivskiy Cemetery (), with many working class graves and the adjacent New Jewish Cemetery. Lychakivskiy Cemetery was used by all Christian sects in the city: in addition to Roman Catholics, it also included Eastern Rite Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox.

After World War II the city (at the time named Lwów) was annexed (from the Second Polish Republic) by the Soviet Union to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The majority of the surviving pre-war inhabitants of the city were expelled to the former German areas awarded to Poland after the Yalta Conference. This started a period of devastation of historical monuments located at the cemetery. Up to 1971 many of the sculptures were destroyed. However, in 1975 the cemetery was declared a historical monument and the degradation ended. Since the late 1980s, the cemetery has seen constant rebuilding and refurbishment and continues to be one of the principal tourist attractions of Lviv.

In late 2006 the city administration announced plans to transfer the tombs of Stepan Bandera, Yevhen Konovalets, Andriy Melnyk and other key leaders of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) / Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) to a new area of the cemetery dedicated to the Ukrainian national liberation struggle.

== Cemetery sections ==


=== Ukrainian National Army Memorial ===
The Ukrainian National Army Memorial (Number 8 on the plan) is devoted to the Ukrainian National Army soldiers buried in the cemetery, including soldiers of the SS Division &quot;Galicia&quot;. It was established due to the efforts of Ukrainian national-patriotic organizations and the Ukrainian emigrant veterans&#x27; movement. It was established with the special effort of , a division veteran, Ukrainian emigrant veterans&#x27; movement social activist and Plast (National Scout Organization of Ukraine) veteran who took an active part in the creation of memorials to the SS Division Galicia on the mountain and near the village of .

=== Field of Mars ===
On the north side of the Cemetery is situated &quot;Field of Mars&quot; (No. 1 on the plan), a war memorial built in 1974. This war memorial originally the graves of 3,800 Soviet soldiers who died in the battles against the Nazi occupiers during World War II) (named &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; in Soviet ideology) and against units of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) (acting up to the mid-1950s). On the wall of the memorial was written a verse: Poetic writing in honor of the Soviet soldiers was eliminated at the direction of urban authorities in 1990s.

The Field of Mars has been used as a burial site for Ukrainians soldiers who died during the Russo-Ukrainian War due to the lack of space at the Ukrainian National Army Memorial within the walls of the Lychakiv Cemetery, according to the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church&#x27;s Military Chaplaincy Center. The Lviv Oblast Council announced on May 20, 2022 that it would hold an architectural contest in order to select the design for a war memorial at the site, which has been described as part of the decommunization process in Ukraine. On August 19, 2022, Lviv authorities approved the exhumation of the remains of Soviet soldiers from the location. The exhumation proceedings uncovered remains dating back to the First World War and belonging to soldiers of the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and Russian armies, which are set to be moved into a dedicated section within the planned memorial, as well as World War II and post-War Soviet burials, which will be transferred to the Holoskiv Cemetery in Lviv.


=== Lwów Defenders&#x27; Cemetery ===

The &quot;Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwów (Cemetery of Eaglets, )&quot; is a memorial and a burial place for the Poles and their allies who died in Lviv during the hostilities of the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918−1919) and Polish-Soviet War (1919−1921).

The complex is a part of the city&#x27;s historic Lychakiv Cemetery. There are about 3000 graves in that part of the cemetery; some from the Lwów Eaglets young militia volunteers, after whom that part of the cemetery is named. It was one of the most famous necropolises of the interwar Poland. Lviv was a city in interwar Poland and at the time named Lwów.

In 1925, the ashes of one of the unknown defenders of Lwów were transferred to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw. After that was built the «Polish mausoleum» (Lwów Eaglets Memorial).

After World War II the cemetery of Lwów Eaglets was completely destroyed and turned into a truck depot and at one time Eaglets Cemetery was damaged with a bulldozer.

Due to the history of complex Polish-Ukrainian relations, the Polish Eaglets Cemetery was neglected because the Ukrainian authorities did not want to rebuild this monument of young Polish soldiers defending the city in 1920s. Though in the late 1980s, workers of a Polish company which were working in Khmelnytskyi started to redecorate and rebuild the necropolis from its ruins (which was not always legal according to Ukrainian law). Although the Ukrainian authorities tried to stop the works several times, the Poles managed to renovate this important memorial of great Lvovians.

Since 1999 there is also a monument to the Sich Riflemen located just outside the Polish mausoleum.

Since the fall of communism, the cemetery had been rebuilt and refurbished. It was finally reopened on 24 June 2005.

=== 1863 January rebels&#x27; hill ===
In the back part of the cemetery (No. 6 on the plan) on a separate field indicated original steel crosses, located «1863 rebels&#x27; hill». Buried here are members Polish January Uprising of 1863, of which a member of the Polish Central National Committee Bronisław Szwarce, the famous zoologist Benedykt Dybowski, cornet Vitebsk land, resting under the central monument rebels , etc.

===Other veterans&#x27; sections===
There are also numerous parts of the cemetery in which veterans of most wars of 19th and 20th centuries are buried, including the quarters of veterans of:
* November Uprising (1830−1831)
* World War I
* Polish Defensive War (1939)
* Victims of the NKVD (1941)
*World War II
==Notable people==

<text>Rasos Cemetery (; , , ) is the oldest and most famous cemetery in the city of Vilnius, Lithuania. It is named after the Rasos district where it is located. It is separated into two parts, the old and the new cemeteries, by a narrow Sukilėliai Street. The total area is 10.8 ha. Since 1990 new burials are allowed only to family graves.

==History==
The year 1769 is cited in many sources as the date when the cemetery was founded. However, some historians believe it is a typo and the real date should be 1796. On April 24, 1801, the new cemetery was consecrated. Two days later Jan Müller, the mayor of Vilnius, became the first person to be buried there. A formal document was signed in July 1801. It specified that the cemetery received of land and that the cemetery will be free of charge to all city residents. It was the first cemetery in Vilnius not located next to a church.

In 1802–1807 two columbariums were built. They reached up to five stories in height and were joined at a right angle. At the end of the 19th century the columbariums began deteriorating. In between the columbariums, a neo-Gothic red brick chapel was built in 1844–50. In 1888 a matching belltower was added to the chapel. At first the cemetery was surrounded by a wooden fence, but it burned down in 1812. A brick fence was rebuilt in 1820 and portions of it survive to this day.

In 1814 the cemetery was expanded as authorities bought additional land from a city resident. The addition is now known as the Hill of the Literati (Lithuanian: &quot;Literatų kalnelis&quot;). In 1847, members of the Eastern Orthodox church opened their own cemetery next to Rasos. It was used to bury soldiers from a nearby monastery hospital and poor city residents. Therefore, it became known as the Cemetery of Orphans (Lithuanian: Našlaičių kapinės).

After World War II, the Soviet authorities demolished the right columbarium and in the 1970s razed the left columbarium. The whole necropolis was to be destroyed in the 1980s as the Soviet authorities planned a major motorway to be built directly through the cemetery. Due to a press campaign led by the Polish-language &quot; &quot; (Red Banner) newspaper and economic difficulties, the destruction was halted. After Lithuanian independence (1990) and the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), Lithuanian and Polish authorities collaborated in a restoration of the cemetery.

==Polish war cemetery==
In 1920 a war cemetery was built near the entrance for 164 Polish soldiers who fell in the city during the Polish–Soviet War and Polish–Lithuanian War. It was rebuilt in 1935–1936 by Wojciech Jastrzębowski, who also designed the tombstone where the heart of Józef Piłsudski is enshrined.

Until September 18, 1939, when the Red Army entered the city, an honorary guard of three soldiers stood there at all times. Three unknown soldiers who refused to give up their arms to the Soviets in 1939 were shot on the spot and are now buried next to Marshal Piłsudski&#x27;s heart. Part of the cemetery contains graves of Polish Home Army soldiers, who fell during the Wilno Uprising. Their graves, demolished after World War II, were rebuilt by the funds of the Republic of Poland in 1993.

<text>The National Anthem of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted in 1990, replacing the previous anthem used during the rule of Ruhollah Khomeini. It was composed by Hassan Riyahi, and the lyrics were written by Sayed Bagheri. It is the fourth national anthem of Iranian overall.

==History==

Due to the death of Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran adopted its current anthem after a competition the following year. At the time of its adoption, it was the second shortest anthem in the world; the first being Japanese national anthem &quot;Kimigayo&quot; of seven lines.

:Your message, O Imam, independence
:and freedom on our souls engraved
:O martyrs, your fervent cries
:resound every generation
:Enduring, lasting and eternal

<doc id="528202" wikidata="Q654062" url="?curid=528202" title="De Havilland Tiger Moth">
<text>The de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth is a 1930s British biplane designed by Geoffrey de Havilland and built by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. It was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and other operators as a primary trainer aircraft. In addition to the type&#x27;s principal use for &quot;ab initio&quot; training, the Second World War had RAF Tiger Moths operating in other capacities, including maritime surveillance and defensive anti-invasion preparations; some aircraft were even outfitted to function as armed light bombers.

The Tiger Moth remained in service with the RAF until it was replaced by the de Havilland Chipmunk during the early 1950s. Many of the military surplus aircraft subsequently entered into civilian operation. Many nations have used the Tiger Moth in both military and civilian applications, and it remains in widespread use as a recreational aircraft. It is still occasionally used as a primary training aircraft, particularly for pilots wanting to gain experience before moving on to other tailwheel aircraft. Many Tiger Moths are now employed by companies offering trial lesson experiences. The de Havilland Moth club, founded in 1975, is now an owners&#x27; association offering a mutual club and technical support.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
Geoffrey de Havilland, the company&#x27;s owner and founder, had sought to produce a light aircraft superior to two of his previous designs, the de Havilland Humming Bird and de Havilland DH.51. From earlier experience, de Havilland knew the difficulty and importance of correctly sizing such an aircraft to appeal to the civilian market, such as touring, trainer, flying club, and private aviation customers; the firm had great success with a scaled-down version of the DH.51, the de Havilland DH.60 Moth.

The starting point for the DH.82 Tiger Moth was the de Havilland DH.71 Tiger Moth. De Havilland had developed successively more capable Gipsy engines, and the company had produced a new low-winged monoplane aircraft to test them. This aircraft became the first aircraft to be referred to as the &quot;Tiger Moth&quot;. Improvements made on the Tiger Moth monoplane were incorporated into a military trainer variant of the DH.60 Moth, the DH.60T Moth – the &quot;T&quot; standing for both &#x27;Tiger&#x27; and &#x27;Trainer&#x27;.

The DH.60T Moth had several shortcomings, thus was subject to several alterations, such as the adoption of shortened interplane struts to raise the wingtips after insufficient ground clearance was discovered while it was undergoing trials at RAF Martlesham Heath. As a result of the Martlesham trials, a favourable report for the type was produced, which in turn led to the type soon being formally adopted as the new basic trainer of the Royal Air Force (RAF). A single prototype, designated the DH.82 Tiger Moth, was ordered by the British Air Ministry under Specification 15/31, which sought a suitable &quot;ab initio&quot; training aircraft.

One of the main changes from the preceding Moth series was improved access to the front cockpit, since the training requirement specified that the front-seat occupant had to be able to escape easily, especially when wearing a parachute. Access to the front cockpit of the Moth&#x27;s predecessors was restricted by the proximity of the aircraft&#x27;s fuel tank, directly above the front cockpit, and the rear cabane struts for the upper wing. The solution adopted was to shift the upper wing forward but sweep the wings back to maintain the same centre of lift. Other changes included a strengthened structure, fold-down doors on both sides of the cockpit, and a revised exhaust system.

On 26 October 1931 the first &#x27;true&#x27; Tiger Moth, the prototype &quot;E6&quot;, made its maiden flight at Stag Lane Aerodrome, Edgware, London, flown by de Havilland Chief Test Pilot Hubert Broad . Shortly thereafter construction of the first 35 production aircraft for the RAF, designated &quot;K2567-K2601&quot;, began following the issuing of Specification T.23/31; in addition two float-equipped seaplanes, &quot;S1675&quot; and &quot;S1676&quot;, were built according to Specification T.6/33.

===Design===
The de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth is a single-engined, biplane, taildragger aircraft with two seats in tandem configuration. It was developed principally to be used by private touring customers as well as for pilot instruction for both military and civilian operators. It is typically powered by a de Havilland Gipsy III 120 hp engine; later models are often fitted with more powerful models of this engine, while some have been re-engined by third-party companies.

One characteristic of the Tiger Moth design is its differential aileron control setup. The ailerons (on the lower wing only) on a Tiger Moth are operated by an externally mounted circular bell crank, which lies flush with the lower wing&#x27;s fabric undersurface covering. This circular bell crank is rotated by metal cables and chains from the cockpit&#x27;s control columns, and has the externally mounted aileron pushrod attached at a point 45° outboard and forward of the bell crank&#x27;s centre when the ailerons are both at their neutral position. This results in an aileron control system operating with barely any travel down at all on the wing on the outside of the turn, while the aileron on the inside travels a large amount upwards to counteract adverse yaw.

From the outset, the Tiger Moth proved to be an ideal trainer, simple and cheap to own and maintain, although control movements required a positive and sure hand as a slowness to control inputs existed. Some instructors preferred these flight characteristics because of the effect of &quot;weeding out&quot; the inept student pilot.

===Production===

The Tiger Moth quickly became a commercial success, and examples were sold to more than 25 air forces. In addition to the military demand, aircraft were also produced for the civilian market. At one point, the flow of orders for the Tiger Moth effectively occupied almost the entirety of de Havilland&#x27;s capacity to manufacture aircraft, and little capacity could be spared to accommodate domestic customers. In 1932, de Havilland also developed an affordable air taxi from the Tiger Moth, using many of the main components of the former with a new plywood fuselage seating four people in an enclosed cabin; it was marketed as the de Havilland Fox Moth. Following the end of all manufacturing, third parties occasionally rebuilt Tiger Moths to a similar configuration to the Fox Moth, such as the Thruxton Jackaroo.

In late 1934, 50 Tiger Moths of a more refined design, sometimes referred to as the Tiger Moth II, were delivered to the RAF; these aircraft adopted the de Havilland Gipsy Major engine, capable of generating 130 HP, and the use of plywood decking on the rear fuselage in place of fabric . Throughout the period 1934–1936, production activity was centred upon meeting the demand for military trainers, including several contracts having been placed by the RAF to Specification T.7/35, along with export orders by seven overseas operators. Civil examples were also being produced at this time, both for British private customers and to export customers in countries such as Ceylon, Greece, Lithuania, Rhodesia, Peru, and Switzerland.

After 1936, the gradual rate of acceleration of Tiger Moth manufacturing had reached the point where production capacity finally became able to exceed the demands from military customers alone. By the outbreak of the Second World War a total of 1,424 Tiger Moths had been completed by both domestic and overseas manufacturing efforts. In 1941 de Havilland transferred principal manufacturing activity for the Tiger Moth from its Hatfield factory to Morris Motors Limited at their facility in Cowley, Oxford.

In 1945, British Tiger Moth production was ended; by this point, Morris Motors had completed a total of 3,433 Tiger Moths.

Overseas manufacturing of the type commenced in 1937; the first such overseas builder was de Havilland Canada at its facility in Downsview, Ontario. In addition to an initial batch of 25 Tiger Moths that were built for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Canadian firm began building fuselages, which were exported to the UK for completion. Canadian-built Tiger Moths featured modifications to better suit the local climate, along with a reinforced tail wheel, hand-operated brakes (built by Bendix Corporation), shorter undercarriage radius rods, and the legs of the main landing gear legs being raked forwards as a safeguard against tipping forwards during braking. In addition, the cockpit had a large sliding canopy fitted along with exhaust-based heating; various alternative undercarriage arrangements were also offered. By the end of Canadian production, de Havilland Canada had manufactured a total of 1,548 of all versions, including the DH.82C and American Menasco Pirate-engined variants (with opposing &quot;right-hand&quot;/&quot;counter-clockwise&quot; rotation to the left-hand/clockwise-running Gipsy Major) known as the Menasco Moth; this also included 200 Tiger Moths that were built under wartime United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Lend-Lease orders, which were designated for paperwork purposes as the PT-24, before being delivered onwards to the RCAF.

Additional overseas manufacturing activity also occurred, most of which took place during wartime. de Havilland Australia assembled an initial batch of 20 aircraft from parts sent from the United Kingdom prior to embarking on their own major production campaign of the DH.82A, which resulted in a total of 1,070 Tiger Moths being constructed in Australia. In late 1940, the first Australian-assembled Tiger Moth conducted its first flight at Bankstown, Sydney. Most Australian aircraft were delivered to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), but several batches were exported, including 18 for the USAAF and 41 for the Royal Indian Air Force.

In New Zealand, 132 Tiger Moths were completed by de Havilland Aircraft of New Zealand; 23 were built in Sweden as the Sk.11&#x27; by AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning, 91 were built in Portugal by OGMA, and another 38 in Norway by Kjeller Flyfabrikk (some sources say 37 so the first may have been assembled from a kit) in addition to a large number of aircraft that were assembled from kits shipped from the UK.

==Operational history==
===Introduction===

The RAF ordered 35 dual-control Tiger Moth Is, which had the company designation DH.82. A subsequent order was placed for 50 aircraft powered by the de Havilland Gipsy Major I engine (130 hp) which was the DH.82A or to the RAF Tiger Moth II. The Tiger Moth entered service at the RAF Central Flying School in February 1932. During the prewar years, increasing numbers of Tiger Moths were procured for the RAF and by overseas customers; by 1939, nearly 40 flying schools operating the type had been established, nine of which operated civilian-register models, as well.

From 1937 onwards, the Tiger Moth was made available to general flying clubs, production having been previously occupied by military customers. The type was used to replace older aircraft in the civilian trainer capacity, such as the older de Havilland Cirrus Moth and Gipsy Moth. By the start of the Second World War, the RAF had around 500 Tiger Moths in service. In addition, nearly all civilian-operated Tiger Moths throughout the Commonwealth were quickly impressed into their respective air forces to meet the wartime demand for trainer aircraft.

===Training===
The Tiger Moth became the primary trainer throughout the Commonwealth and elsewhere. It was the principal type used in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, where thousands of military pilots got their first taste of flight in a Tiger Moth. The RAF found the Tiger Moth&#x27;s handling ideal for training fighter pilots. Generally docile and forgiving in the normal flight phases encountered during initial training, when used for aerobatic and formation training, the Tiger Moth required skill and concentration to perform well; a botched manoeuvre could cause the aircraft to stall or spin. From 1941 onwards, all military and many civilian Tiger Moths were outfitted with antispin strakes positioned on the junction between the fuselage and the leading edge of the tailplane, known as Mod 11&#x27;; later on, the aileron mass balances were removed for improved spin recovery performance.

===Gunnery target drone===
In 1935, the DH.82 Queen Bee, a pilotless, radio-controlled variant of the Tiger Moth, appeared for use in training antiaircraft gunners. Use of the word drone, as a generic term for pilotless aircraft, apparently originated from the name and role of the Queen Bee (i.e. the word drone is a reference to the male bee, which makes one flight in search of the female queen bee and then subsequently dies). The DH.82 had a wooden fuselage, based on that of the DH.60 Gipsy Moth (with appropriate structural changes related to cabane strut placement) and the wings of the Tiger Moth II. Queen Bees retained a normal front cockpit for test-flying or ferry flights, but had a radio-control system in the rear cockpit to operate the controls using pneumatically driven servos.

In total, 400 were built by de Havilland at Hatfield and a further 70 by Scottish Aviation. There were nearly 300 in service at the start of the Second World War.

===Coastal patrol===
In December 1939, owing to a shortage of maritime patrol aircraft, six flights of Tiger Moths were operated by RAF Coastal Command for surveillance flights over coastal waters, known as &quot;scarecrow patrols&quot;. The aircraft operated in pairs and were armed only with a Very pistol. The intention was to force any encroaching U-boat to dive; one aircraft would then remain in the vicinity while the other would search for a naval patrol vessel that could be led back to the spot. Because they were not radio equipped, each aircraft also carried a pair of homing pigeons in a wicker basket to call for help in case of a forced landing at sea. A 25-lb (11.5 kg) bomb was sometimes carried, but no record shows one being dropped in action.

===Anti-invasion preparations===
In the aftermath of Britain&#x27;s disastrous campaign in France, in August 1940 three proposals for beach defence systems were put forward; 350 Tiger Moths were fitted with bomb racks to serve as light bombers as a part of Operation Banquet. A more radical conversion involved the &quot;paraslasher&quot;, a scythe-like blade fitted to a Tiger Moth and intended to cut parachutists&#x27; canopies as they descended. Flight tests proved the idea, but it was not officially adopted. The Tiger Moth was also tested as a dispenser of Paris green rat poison for use against ground troops, with powder dispensers located under the wings.

===Postwar===


In the postwar climate, impressed Tiger Moths were restored to their former civilian operations and owners. Accordingly, large numbers of Tiger Moths were made available for sale to flying clubs and individuals. Relatively few new light aircraft being manufactured at the time to take its place. Due to the type being inexpensive to operate and the aforementioned factors, the Tiger Moth was met with an enthusiastic reception across the civilian market. Additionally, it was put to use for new roles, including aerial advertising, aerial ambulance, aerobatic performer, crop dusting, and glider tug work.

In the air-racing market, Tiger Moths were converted to a single-seat configuration, often temporarily. Several aircraft were extensively modified for greater speed; these changes included alterations such as the removal of the centre-section fuel tank, alternative fuel tank configurations, all-new elevators, custom-designed fuel injectors, and the recovering of the fuselage with lighter-weight fabric. Three particular aircraft, &quot;G-APDZ&quot;, &quot;G-ANZZ&quot; and &quot;G-ANMZ&quot;, were accordingly rebuilt and were used in international competitions; the design changes led to substantially improved performance during inverted flight.

Ex-RAF examples were imported to the Netherlands during the postwar era and used to equip the Dutch National Flying School at Ypenburg. These aircraft were required by the Dutch civil aviation authorities to be fitted with a larger dorsal fin, incorporating an extended forward fillet to the fin, to provide for additional area; this requirement was also extended to privately owned Tiger Moths in the Netherlands.

The Tiger Moth might be confused at first glance with the Belgian-designed Stampe SV.4 aerobatic aircraft, which had a very similar design layout; both aircraft made use of a similar main landing gear configuration, a slightly sweepback wing, and an alike engine/cowling design. Several Tiger Moths were converted during the 1950s to a &quot;Coupe&quot; standard, which involved the installation of a sliding canopy over both crew positions, not unlike the Canadian-built Fleet Finch biplane trainers that had worked beside the Tiger Moth in RCAF service as trainers in Canada during the type&#x27;s wartime years.

After the development of aerial topdressing in New Zealand, large numbers of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force Tiger Moths built in that country and in the United Kingdom were converted into agricultural aircraft; at the time, this was a pioneering use for aircraft. In this role, the front seat was commonly replaced with a hopper to hold superphosphate for aerial topdressing. A large number were also used to deploy insecticide in the crop-sprayer role, for which several alternative arrangements, including perforated piping being installed underneath the mainplanes or the placement of rotary atomisers on the lower mainplane, were used.

Royal Navy Tiger Moths used as target tugs and &quot;air experience&quot; machines became the last military examples when that service purchased a batch of refurbished ex-civilian examples in 1956. One became the last biplane to land on an aircraft carrier () in the English Channel during the summer of 1967. On takeoff, the wind over the deck allowed the aircraft to fly, but it was slower than the carrier, which turned hard to starboard to avoid a possible collision. These planes remained in service until the early 1970s.

The Tiger Moth (and to a lesser extent, the similar Belgian Stampe-Vertongen SV.4) had been often used as a stand-in for rarer aircraft in films, sometimes having been extensively modified to outwardly resemble the aircraft it was depicting. Three aircraft were converted by Croydon-based Film Aviation Services Ltd for use in the filming of the 1962 movie &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;; one Tiger Moth became a replica of a Fokker D.VII, while two aircraft resembled the Rumpler C.V to depict these types for the film. Several Tiger Moths were used in the crash scenes in &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot;, standing in for the Curtiss JN-1. Due to the popularity of the design and the rising cost of flyable examples, a number of replicas (scale and full-sized) have been designed for the homebuilder; these include the Fisher R-80 Tiger Moth and the RagWing RW22 Tiger Moth.

==Flying characteristics==

The Tiger Moth responds well to control inputs and is fairly easy to fly for a tail-dragger. Its big &quot;parachute&quot; wings are very forgiving, and it stalls at a speed as slow as 25 knots with power. Its stall and spin characteristics are benign. It has some adverse yaw and therefore requires rudder input during turns. The Tiger Moth exhibits the fundamental requirements of a training aircraft, in being &quot;easy to fly, but difficult to fly well&quot;; the aircraft&#x27;s benign handling when within its limits make it easy for the novice to learn the basic skills of flight. At the same time techniques such as coordinated flight must be learnt and used effectively, and the aircraft will show up mishandling to an observant instructor or attentive pupil. As training progresses towards more advanced areas, especially aerobatics, the skill required on the part of a Tiger Moth pilot increases. The aircraft will not, like some training aircraft, &quot;fly its way out of trouble&quot; but will instead stall or spin if mishandled. However the stall and spin remain benign, again showing up deficient piloting without endangering the aircraft or the crew. These characteristics were invaluable to military operators, who must identify between pilots with the potential to go on to fly fighter aircraft, those more suited to lower-performance machines and those who must be relegated to non-pilot aircrew positions.

Because the Tiger Moth has no electrical system, it must be started by hand. Being a tail-dragging biplane, taxiing also requires care. The pilot cannot see directly ahead, so the lower wing can hit obstructions, and it is susceptible to gusts of wind on its inclined, large, upper wing.

The takeoff is uneventful, and it has a reasonable rate of climb. However full power should not be maintained for more than a minute to avoid damaging the engine.

The Tiger Moth&#x27;s biplane design makes it strong, and it is fully aerobatic. However it has ailerons only on its bottom wing, which makes its rate of roll relatively slow for a biplane; and, as stated previously, the ailerons on a Tiger Moth normally operate with a heavy degree of designed-in differential operation (mostly deflecting up, hardly at all downwards) to avoid adverse yaw problems in normal flight. Most manoeuvres are started at about 90 to 110 knots, and it has a Velocity Never Exceeded (VNE) of 140 knots. It is important to lock the automatic slats (leading edge flaps) during aerobatic manoeuvres.

There are two methods of landing. &quot;Wheeler&quot; landing involves pushing the plane on to the runway at a moderate speed with just the main wheels on the ground, with the tail held up until speed reduces. It does not tend to bounce. Unlike most taildraggers, slow speed three-point landings are quite difficult because there is not enough elevator authority to bring the tail down to the correct three-point attitude. This means that the tail needs to be brought down sharply at just the right speed in order for the angular momentum to carry it down sufficiently.

The open cockpit allows pilots to move their heads over the side to see the runway during approach and landing. As the aircraft is a tail dragger, it is essential to land it straight with no sideways movement, to avoid ground loops.

One often undocumented feature is that the carburettor de-icing mechanism is activated automatically when the throttle is reduced. This means that when an engine is running poorly due to ice the pilot must reduce power even further and then wait for the ice to melt.

==Variants==
;DH.60T Moth Trainer/Tiger Moth
:Military training version of the De Havilland DH.60 Moth. First eight prototype DH.82 configuration aircraft were named Tiger Moth.
;DH.82 Tiger Moth (Tiger Moth I)
:Two-seat primary trainer aircraft. Powered by a 120 hp (89 kW) de Havilland Gipsy III piston engine; renamed &quot;Tiger Moth I&quot; in RAF.

;DH.82A Tiger Moth (Tiger Moth II)
:Two-seat primary trainer aircraft. Powered by a 130 hp (97 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine and fitted with a hood over the rear cockpit for blind flying instruction. Named &quot;Tiger Moth II&quot; in RAF.

;DH.82B Tiger Moth III
:Improved variant with a de Havilland Gipsy Major III engine, it had a wider fuselage and larger fin. First flown on 1 October 1939 only one was built. In some references the designation is erroneously applied to the Queen Bee.

;DH.82C Tiger Moth
:Cold weather operations version for the RCAF. Fitted with sliding perspex canopies, cockpit heating, brakes, tail wheels and metal struts. Wheels were moved forwards by 9.75&quot; to compensate for the installation of brakes by changing the angle of the undercarriage legs. Powered by a 145 hp (108 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine. 1,523 built (including Menasco Moths and PT-24).

;DH.82C-2 Menasco Moth I
:DH.82C fitted with Menasco D-4 Super Pirate 125 hp inline inverted 4-cylinder engine due to shortages of Gipsy Major engines. Because of the reduction in power, they were used primarily as radio trainers. Externally distinguishable from 82C by opposite rotation of propeller and reversal of the cowling openings. 10 built.

;DH.82C-4 Menasco Moth II
:As DH.82C-2 but with reduced fuel capacity and further detail alterations. One example survives and is on display at Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. 125 built.

;DH.82C-4 Menasco Moth III
:Fitted with American AT-1/AR-2 radio and intended as a radio trainer from outset but project cancelled when shortages of British radios and engines was resolved. The sole example, RCAF 4934 was converted from Menasco Moth II.

;DH.82 
:A target drone for anti-aircraft gunnery training. It could be flown unmanned under radio-control, but was also fitted with a cockpit so it could be flown by a pilot. Tiger Moth wings were used and, to reduce cost, a wooden fuselage based on that of the DH.60 Moth (but with the structural changes associated with the cabane struts having been relocated as per the standard Tiger Moth) was used. Between 1935 and 1943, 412 were built in float and wheeled versions. As of 2008, the sole remaining airworthy Queen Bee resided at RAF Henlow, England.

;PT-24 Moth
:United States military designation for the DH.82C ordered for Lend-Lease to the Royal Canadian Air Force; 200 were built by de Havilland Canada.
;Thruxton Jackaroo

:Four-seat cabin biplane, modified from existing DH.82A airframes by widening the gap between the fuselage longerons. 19 were converted in the United Kingdom.

;DH.83 Fox Moth
:Used many Tiger Moth components including wings (rerigged to remove sweep), tail and undercarriage with a new fuselage featuring an enclosed cabin for the passengers, and an open cockpit for the pilot. Built in both the United Kingdom before the Second World War and in Canada after the war.

Privately owned Tiger Moths, type if known, and any history of the airframe:
*William N. Thibault of Newport Beach, CA owns a registered 1935 Tiger Moth DH82A with a Gypsy Moth engine. There are confirmed sightings of the aircraft at the Watsonville Municipal Airport in CA and Gillespie Field in El Cajon CA. The most recent photos of the aircraft have it flying out of the Santa Ynez CA airport. It might have been previously owned by the Royal Air Force of the UK and Fuerza Aerea Uruguaya, the Uruguayan Air force. However, the Uruguayan Air Force wrote it off as a total loss in 1941, only for it to resurface in 1971 when it was issued a certificate of airworthiness after 30 years.

<text>Neptune Orient Lines Limited (NOL) was a Singaporean container shipping company. It was founded in 1968 as Singapore&#x27;s national shipping line, but was later sold as a subsidiary to French shipping company CMA CGM in 2016. On 1 October 2020, NOL was restructured into a regional hub and was renamed to CMA CGM Asia Pacific Limited.

==History==
In December 1968, Neptune Orient Lines was started as Singapore&#x27;s national shipping line. Wholly owned by the Singapore Government, it was formed in an effort to develop and support Singapore&#x27;s economy.

===Containerization===
In the 1970s, containerization was introduced. In the mid-1970s, NOL&#x27;s managing director was Goh Chok Tong, who went on to become Singapore&#x27;s second Prime Minister.

In 1975, NOL then entered the Asia-Europe trade as part of the ACE Group consortium with partners OOCL, K Line, COSCO and Franco-Belgian Services, known as the &quot;third force&quot; in the container-shipping world. Meanwhile, it entered the key Trans-Pacific Trade with a standalone service.

===Merger with APL===
In 1997, NOL made a US$825 million acquisition of American President Lines (APL), whose heritage dates back to 1848. Following the merger, the APL name was adopted as the public brand name. The NOL name was retained for the holding company, which was listed on the Singapore Exchange and was well known to its investors. The company focused on managing global supply chains in 2001 when APL Logistics was established as a separate business unit.

In 1998, during the Asian economic crisis, NOL saw losses mount to US$460 million, while its debt was more than US$4 billion. The company sold off assets to clear the debt and by 1999 was profitable again.

In 2003, NOL completed the divestment of its tankering businesses AET and NAS, to concentrate on the company&#x27;s core container shipping and logistics services.

On 1 October 2011, Ng Yat Chung was appointed as CEO of NOL, replacing Ron Widdows.

On 17 February 2015, APL Logistics was sold to Kintetsu World Express, Inc. for US$1.2 billion.

===Sale of NOL to France&#x27;s CMA CGM===
On 9 June 2016, it was announced that Temasek will tender its NOL shares to shipping company CMA CGM. CMA launched an all-cash voluntary conditional general offer for outstanding NOL shares at SG$1.30 a piece. The deal is worth SG$3.38 billion and eventually will be delisted from the Singapore Exchange.

The company announced in May 2016 reported net losses of US$105.1 million (SG$142 million) for the first quarter ended 31 March, higher than the US$10.8 million a year earlier. Former CEO Ng Yat Chung acknowledged that the company had been &quot;a bit slow and reluctant to change&quot;.

On 28 June 2016, CMA CGM said it will proceed to delist NOL, after it crossed the 90 per cent ownership threshold in the company and NOL was subsequently delisted on 5 September 2016.

In May 2017, less than a year after the NOL acquisition, CMA reported turning a net profit of $26 million from the NOL business in the first quarter of the year.

=== Restructuring to CMA CGM Asia Pacific Limited ===
On 7 July 2020, CMA CGM announced a restructuring of its services in the Asia-Pacific region. NOL and CMA&#x27;s regional office was reorganized into a regional hub and renamed to CMA CGM Asia Pacific Limited on 1 October 2020.

<text>The Cadbury Report, titled &quot;Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance&quot;, is a report issued by &quot;The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance&quot; chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of Cadbury, that sets out recommendations on the arrangement of company boards and accounting systems to mitigate corporate governance risks and failures. 

In 1991 the London Stock Exchange set up the Cadbury committee and the report was published in draft version in May 1992. Its revised and final version was issued in December of the same year. The report&#x27;s recommendations have been used to varying degrees to establish other codes such as those of the OECD, the European Union, the United States, the World Bank etc.

==Background==
Sridhar Arcot and Valentina Bruno in their article called &quot;In Letter but not in Spirit: An Analysis of Corporate Governance in the UK&quot; explain the background to the Cadbury Committee. Although wrong on the historical facts, as Robert Maxwell died on 5 November 1991 and &quot;The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance&quot; known as &quot;The Cadbury Committee&quot; was set up in May 1991 for other reasons than the Maxwell case, it gives an interesting reading of the situation at the time:

==History lesson: Cadbury 1992==
Lessons from the report according to The National Computing Centre, 2010:

* Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance
* Division of top responsibilities:
** No one individual has powers of decision
** Majority of independent non-executive directors
** At least three non-executives on the audit committee (oversee accounting/financial reporting)
** Majority of non-executives on the remuneration committee
** Non-executives to be selected by the whole board

<text>Lissycasey () is a village in County Clare, Ireland. It forms one half of the parish of Clondegad-Kilchrist. The village straddles the N68 Ennis-Kilrush road for some 3.5 km. The area stretches east–west from Caherea to Crown and north–south from Frure North to Cloncolman. Lissycasey were Clare county champions in football in 2007 and won the Cusack Cup that year.

The Roman Catholic parish of Ballynacally (Clondegad) encompasses Ballynacally, Lissycasey and Ballycorick, and is part of the Diocese of Killaloe.

==Sword of O&#x27;Neill==
In 1881, foreign publications reported that two men digging a drain near Lissycasey discovered an iron clasped chest laying on which was a large sword engraved with the name &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot;. The men assumed it to be a coffin and reported the discovery to the police. The box was opened by the police and found it was full of gold coins of an ancient date.

<text>Mister Sinister (Dr. Nathaniel Essex) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont, the character was first mentioned as the employer behind the team of assassins known as the Marauders in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #212 (December 1986), and later seen in silhouette in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #213, with both issues serving as chapters of the 1986 &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; crossover. Mr. Sinister then made his first full appearance in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #221 (September 1987). His appearance was designed by artist Marc Silvestri.

A villain who usually prefers to act through agents and manipulation, Mr. Sinister was born Nathaniel Essex in Victorian London. A human scientist, Essex is inspired by the work of his contemporary Charles Darwin and becomes obsessed with engineering humanity into a perfect race of superhumans. As he learns about mutants (superhuman beings born with the X-gene), Essex encounters the mutant villain Apocalypse. The two become allies and Apocalypse uses alien Celestial technology to transform the British scientist into Mr. Sinister, an ageless man with super-powers. Later on, Sinister increases his power through self-experimentation. In the modern day, Sinister develops a great interest and protective attitude towards the mutant heroes Cyclops and Jean Grey, believing their DNA can create the ultimate mutant. This and other factors lead him to have repeated clashes with the X-Men (a group Cyclops and Jean Grey helped found) and related teams. Through clones, Sinister has managed to cheat his death repeatedly and even acquire a mutant gene. 

Making frequent appearances in the &quot;X-Men&quot; comics and related spin-off titles, Mr. Sinister has also featured in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, toys, trading cards, and video games. IGN&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time&quot; ranked Sinister as #29. The character was exposed to a wider audience with his television debut on &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; voiced by Christopher Britton, as well as an appearance in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; voiced by Clancy Brown.

==Publication history==
Writer Chris Claremont conceived Sinister as a new villain for the X-Men. Having felt &quot;tired of just going back to Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and the same old same old&quot; Claremont recalled:

Mister Sinister was first mentioned by the assassin Sabretooth as the employer behind the team of assassins known as the Marauders in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #212 (December 1986), which was part of the 1986 &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; storyline, in which Sinister ordered the Marauders to kill the Morlocks living beneath New York City. In the next issue, drawn by Alan Davis, Mr. Sinister is first glimpsed as a generic silhouette when the telepathic X-Man Psylocke scans Sabretooth&#x27;s mind. Mister Sinister appeared unobscured for the first time on the opening splash page of issue #221 (September 1987), drawn by Marc Silvestri. The character is one of the major antagonists in the 1989 &quot;Inferno&quot; storyline, where it is revealed he created the character Madelyne Pryor, estranged wife of Scott Summers (the mutant hero Cyclops), by cloning Scott&#x27;s former lover Jean Grey, who was believed dead at the time. Sinister sent Madelyne into Scott&#x27;s life in the hopes that the combined DNA of Grey and Summers would result in the birth of a powerful mutant. Soon after &quot;Inferno&quot;, Sinister is also revealed to have manipulated Cyclops&#x27; life since early childhood and who at times has influenced his behavior from afar. After a battle with the X-Men and X-Factor, the villain is apparently destroyed by Cyclops&#x27; optic beam, leaving behind only bones.

Months after his apparent death, backup stories by Claremont published in the reprint series &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #41–42 (December 1989) detailed the role Mister Sinister played in Cyclops&#x27; early life at an orphanage in Nebraska. The stories feature a boy named Nate who is roommates with the young Scott Summers. Despite Scott saying he does not particularly like Nate, the boy appears to be unhealthily attached to him and is aggressively protective, blocking Scott from having other friends. Claremont intended Nate to actually be Mister Sinister, revealing this was his true form and the armored villain was an illusion he used to threaten others. However, Claremont left the X-Men comics before this origin was revealed to readers. Fans later considered &quot;Nate&quot; to be Sinister in disguise as a boy, whereas his adult, armored appearance was his true form. The 2009 series &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; (vol. 2) showed an alternate timeline, beginning at roughly the same point where Chris Claremont left as head writer of the X-Men years before. Written by Claremont, the series revealed how he would have continued the stories and what revelations he would have made about different characters. The 2010 sequel series, &quot;X-Men Forever 2&quot; features Mr. Sinister as a character who is over a century old yet still physically an adolescent boy, using a robot called Mr. Sinister to act as a proxy.

Despite his apparent death in 1989, Sinister appeared again in &quot;X-Factor&quot; in 1992, now leader of the Nasty Boys team and displaying the ability to regenerate from damage. He played a major role in the 1992-1993 crossover storyline &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, unwittingly helping to unleash the Legacy Virus on the world. In &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #22-23 (1993), Sinister reveals his seeming death in 1989 was a &quot;ruse&quot; so he could retreat rather than fight the combined X-Men and X-Factor teams. The same story depicts Sinister willing to protect Cyclops from other villains.

By 1994 Mister Sinister was popular enough that Chef Boyardee used him to advertise its pasta. In &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) Annual 1995, flashbacks reveal Sinister living in Los Angeles in the 1930s as &quot;Nathan Essex&quot; and depict him as an adult man during that era. In the 1996 limited series &quot;The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix&quot;, writer Peter Milligan (with artists John Paul Leon and Klaus Janson) establishes Sinister&#x27;s origin, revealing he was originally a Victorian-era scientist named Nathaniel Essex who later gained superhuman powers from Apocalypse, thus abandoning Claremont&#x27;s idea that he was an immortal trapped in the form of a child.

The 2006 mini-series &quot;X-Men: Colossus Bloodline&quot; revealed that Mr. Sinister&#x27;s powers were weakening and he hoped to restore them. Before he can restore his full power, Sinister is killed in &quot;New X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #46 (2008). The same year, a contingency plan in &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; #214-215 involves him attempting to take a new host body, but fails. In &quot;X-23&quot; (vol. 3) #5-6 (2011), another resurrection contingency plan led to the creation of Miss Sinister and to Mr. Sinister&#x27;s mind inhabiting a clone body of himself. In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #544 (2011), it is revealed that Sinister is now an entire colony of Sinister clones co-existing, each with minor differences. In subsequent battles, the leader Sinister and other clones were killed, only to be replaced by new clones with the same consciousness and improved genetics. The community of Sinister clones is destroyed in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #16 (2012). In issue #17 (2012), reveals that one copy of Mr. Sinister&#x27;s mind survived, however, planting himself in the mind of X-Men public relations manager Kate Kildare. The surviving Sinister mind kills her and creates a new clone body to inhabit.

In the 2019 mini-series &quot;Powers of X&quot;, it is revealed that several years before the present-day, one of the Sinister clones created possessed an X-gene, making him a mutant like the X-Men. This mutant Sinister assumed leadership of the community of Sinister clones and seems to be the surviving version who operates today. The same mini-series involved Mr. Sinister joining the new mutant community of the island Krakoa, and joining its ruling Quiet Council alongside Magneto, Professor X, Apocalypse, and others.

The 2023 series &quot;Immortal X-Men&quot; established that the original Nathaniel Essex died in 1895 on being murdered by Sherlock Holmes / Mystique. Before his death he created four clones to research paths to Machine Dominionhood independent of one another, whom Mystique&#x27;s wife Destiny (Irene Adler) ensured would survive to adulthood. The clone branded with (♦️) continued to operate as Minister Sinister, while two others, branded with (♣️) and (♠️) respectively, became Doctor Stasis who researched various ways to post-Humanity and Orbis Stellaris who abandoned Earth and ventured into space to research alien technologies. The fourth clone with the (♥️) was of his late wife Rebecca who became a magical user called Mother Righteous. The male clones were unaware of one another for a long time, and each believed themselves to be the original Nathaniel, with no memory of dying and being cloned. In different possible futures, each had eventually succeeded in ascending to categorical godhood as a Dominion, only to be blocked and had their progress harvested by the A.I. imprint of the original Essex, who thus retroactively brought itself into existence as Enigma, a universal-level godlike intelligence existing outside space and time.

==Fictional character biography==
===19th century===
Born in Milbury House in Victorian London, Nathaniel Essex is the son of Admiral Erasmus Essex and Mary Essex. Earning a full scholarship to the University of Oxford, Essex becomes a biologist in 1859 and marries his wife Rebecca. A contemporary of Charles Darwin, Essex becomes highly interested in research regarding evolution and &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; He concludes humanity is undergoing increasing mutation due to what he calls &quot;Essex Factors&quot; in the human genome. After the loss of his four-year-old son Adam due to birth defects, Essex becomes more obsessed with his research in perfecting and improving the human race. Arguing that science is beyond morality, his questionable research methods and ideas lead to suspicion, mockery, and finally ousting from the Royal Society and the scientific community. Angry and bitter, Essex accepts that being a &quot;monster&quot; in the eyes of others may be necessary to achieve his goals.

Essex later hires the criminal Cootie Tremble and his gang, known as the Marauders. The Marauders kidnap homeless people off the streets of London as test subjects for Essex&#x27;s experiments, including a man named Daniel Summers (whose descendant Scott Summers will one day be the hero called Cyclops). Two years after Adam Essex&#x27;s death, Nathaniel Essex learns that some humans are born with mutant genetics that make them superhuman and discovers that one called En Sabah Nur (&quot;The First One,&quot; known in later years as Apocalypse) is in hibernation. The Marauders awaken En Sabah Nur who then offers Essex an alliance, believing they have similar goals in perfecting the world and humanity.

Nur then intends to conquer 19th-century England but is confronted by Cyclops and Phoenix, heroes from the future who arrive via time travel. Nur defeats the two heroes, leaving them for Essex to experiment on. Hoping to stop Apocalypse and possibly the origin of Mr. Sinister, Phoenix tells Essex that continuing his work with Nur will lead to worldwide destruction. Sensing truth in her words, Essex releases the heroes and decides to rededicate himself to family, as his wife Rebecca is pregnant again. Meanwhile, Rebecca Essex discovers Nathaniel&#x27;s imprisoned human test subjects and his lab where he has experimented on the remains of their son. After freeing the prisoners and reburying her son, Rebecca goes into premature labor and her second child dies in stillbirth. Nathaniel then finds Rebecca, who is now dying from blood loss, and asks for forgiveness. Rebecca refuses, saying with her dying breath, &quot;To me, you are... utterly... and contemptibly... sinister!&quot; Following Rebecca&#x27;s death, Essex continues his alliance with En Sabah Nur, becoming the villain&#x27;s first &quot;prelate.&quot; Apocalypse reveals he has alien technology belonging to the Celestials (god-like beings who manipulated humanity in the past, resulting in the creation of the Eternals and the Deviants, as well as humanity&#x27;s genetic potential for superhumans). With the Celestial machines, Apocalypse subjects Essex to a painful genetic transformation, turning him into an ageless being with chalk-white skin and a form of telekinesis. En Sabah Nur tells the transformed scientist to shed his past identity and choose another, and Essex renames himself &quot;Sinister.&quot; Although he claims his humanity is gone, Essex continues to carry Rebecca&#x27;s photo until 1882.

When Apocalypse demands Sinister create a plague that will wipe out much of humanity, leaving only &quot;the strong&quot; alive, the scientist refuses, arguing that cruelty without purpose is ignorance and the enemy of science. Appreciating Sinister has shown strength through defiance, Apocalypse returns to his hibernation state, promising that when he returns he and Sinister will reshape the world. Following the death of Charles Darwin, Sinister travels to America and assumes the identity of obstetrician &quot;Nathan Milbury&quot; (taking the name of his ancestral home), head of the Essex Clinic in New York in the 1890s. There he continues secret experiments on people. He comes to understand more and more that mutants are human beings born with an &quot;X-factor gene&quot; or &quot;X-gene&quot;, causing powers, traits, and abilities that often manifest during puberty or trauma. One early test subject is a mutant with a long lifespan named Amanda Mueller. To study how the X-gene may pass on to children in different ways, Sinister arranges for Amanda to marry his former test subject Daniel Summers (who recently became the first of his family to immigrate to America). On several occasions when Amanda is pregnant, Sinister pays her to feign miscarriage and then secretly bring him the child for study. Seeing great potential in the Summers genetic line, Sinister decides to monitor the family.

Around this same time, Sinister encounters two other mutants traveling from the future: Gambit and Courier. After experimenting with a cell sample from the latter man, Sinister gains complete control over his physical form, allowing him regenerative abilities and shape-shifting, while leaving Courier trapped in the form of a woman. Before the two time travelers leave, Sinister sees evidence of his own surgical techniques on Gambit.

In 1899, Apocalypse emerges from hibernation again and is pleased with Sinister&#x27;s work, including the development of a deadly techno-organic virus. Sinister then injects the virus into Apocalypse, but it only weakens the villain. As Apocalypse returns to hibernation to heal, he promises to kill Sinister when next they meet. Sinister decides to engineer a mutant who can kill Apocalypse.

===20th century===
In 1907, Sinister works at the Ravencroft Institute and employs the mutant killer and mercenary Sabretooth as an agent. Sabretooth brings him the mutant called Logan for experimentation, but the man is then freed by coworker Dr. Claudia Russell (ancestor of the werewolf Jack Russell). Sinister leaves Ravencroft afterward. In 1912, Sinister encounters Grigori Rasputin and encourages him to father many children, promising they will have superhuman potential. Rasputin&#x27;s descendants later include siblings Colossus, Magik, and Mikhail Rasputin. A few years after meeting Rasputin, Sinister grants shape-shifting abilities to Jacob Shaw (father of the X-Men villain Sebastian Shaw). It is possible that during the 1920s, Sinister also gave Dr. Herbert Edgar Wyndham information regarding how to map and break the human genetic code. Wyndam, a student of the Inhuman scientist Phaeder, later becomes the master geneticist called the High Evolutionary.

During the 1920s, Sinister lives in Los Angeles as &quot;Nathan Essex&quot; and befriends radio comedian Faye Livingstone. Realizing Faye&#x27;s potential to have mutant children, Sinister temporarily imprisons and experiments on her. After her release, Faye never has children and develops cancer. As her mind and health deteriorate, she becomes a hospital patient in San Diego for the rest of her life, her treatment provided by Sinister himself, who visits annually in his human guise of Nathan Essex.

During World War II, Sinister works with the Nazi Josef Mengele. Several Nazis who encounter Sinister nickname him &quot;Nosferatu.&quot; A young Max Eisenhardt (who will grow to be Magneto) encounters him at this time and realizes Sinister is experimenting on children, killing those he deems failures or no longer needed. During these experiments, Sinister sometimes plays a favorite piece by Franz Schubert. During his work with the Nazis, Sinister creates a clone of Namor named N2. This clone is defeated by Captain America. Soon afterward, Sinister leaves the Nazis, concluding they will lose the war. Mr. Sinister&#x27;s research during World War II is later recovered and used by the Weapon X project.

Following World War II, Sinister adopts the name &quot;Dr. Nathan Milbury&quot; again and works on Project: Black Womb with Dr. Kurt Marko (the father of Juggernaut), Dr. Alexander Ryking (who, like Marko, is a friend and colleague of Brian Xavier, father of Charles Xavier), and the precognitive mutant Irene Adler. They conduct research on many mutant children and take note of several families that may produce mutant children later, allowing Sinister to monitor these bloodlines for decades. Concerned his own physical death may be inevitable, Sinister uses the Cronus Device to implant his own hidden cells of his genetic information into the DNA strands of the Marko, Ryking, Shaw, and Xavier family lines. In time, their descendants can act as hosts for Sinister&#x27;s consciousness.

During the Vietnam War, Mr. Sinister sets up a lab in Saigon and has his agent Scalphunter bring him soldiers and civilians for experimentation. Locals refer to Sinister as the &quot;White Devil.&quot; In 1968, Sabretooth investigates Sinister&#x27;s operation but is then bribed and blackmailed to not interfere. He is told Sinister may have use for him in the future. Some years later, as &quot;Dr. Milbury&quot;, Mr. Sinister becomes a professor at the University of Oxford. His students include Moira MacTaggert and the mutant telepath Charles Xavier, who realizes he cannot sense Milbury&#x27;s thoughts.

Years after Sinister&#x27;s time back at Oxford, and during the time that Charles Xavier is first befriending Magneto while both are living in Israel, a version of the heroic mutant Hank McCoy from an alternate timeline (known as the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;) enters the mainstream Marvel reality. Known as the Dark Beast, this corrupt version of McCoy is former student and employee of his reality&#x27;s Sinister. Dark Beast eventually makes his way to New York City and experiments on many mutants, using techniques his Sinister taught him. Several of his surviving test subjects become deformed or disabled by their own abilities as a result, choosing to hide underground and join a sewer-dwelling mutant community known as the &quot;Morlocks&quot; (taking the name from the subterranean race of the novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;). Years later, Dark Beast&#x27;s experiments indirectly lead to Sinister ordering the &quot;Mutant Massacre.&quot;

===Jean Grey and Scott Summers===
Returning to America, Sinister creates an orphanage to monitor some of the children of families he first observed during Project: Black Womb. The State Home for Foundlings in Omaha, Nebraska hides a high-tech, underground laboratory. Later, young Jean Grey&#x27;s mutant telepathy prematurely activates when she witnesses the death of her best friend. Becoming aware of Jean&#x27;s power, Mr. Sinister plans to kill her parents and bring her to the orphanage, only to learn the Greys have already contacted the now adult Charles Xavier for help, due to his background as a leading geneticist and psychological expert in trauma cases. Not wishing to be detected by Xavier, who at this point has already fought terrorists and superhuman menaces, Sinister decides to keep his distance after acquiring a DNA sample from Jean.

Soon afterward, Sinister discovers a recently orphaned mutant boy named Scott Summers (descendant of Daniel Summers) released the same type of optic blasts displayed by the time-traveling hero Cyclops. Sinister tracks down Scott and his younger brother Alex, both of whom survived an airplane explosion that seemingly killed their parents. Scott awakens in the hospital and accidentally releases another optic blast, unable to shut off his power (perhaps due to brain-damage suffered during the fall). To experiment on the boy in a controlled environment, Sinister causes Scott to slip into a coma then arranges for him and his brother to be entrusted to the State Home for Foundlings. Mr. Sinister allows Alex to be adopted by people he can easily monitor, then spends the next year conducting experiments on the comatose Scott. Concluding the boy will never be able to fully control his power, Sinister learns the kinetic force blasts can be blocked by ruby quartz lenses. After placing temporary mental blocks in Scott, Sinister allows the boy to awaken. Scott experiences migraines until he is given ruby quartz glasses.

Scott spends a few years in the care of the State Home for Foundlings. Hoping to make Cyclops an isolated warrior who can be easily manipulated, Sinister takes on the guise of Nate, another orphan who acts as Scott&#x27;s overly territorial friend while sometimes bullying him. As part of his long-term plan, Sinister allows Scott Summers to be adopted by a criminal named Jack Winters who abuses the boy and forces him to help with crimes. Rather than bend to his abusive guardian, Scott resists and is discovered by Professor Charles Xavier and his ally FBI agent Fred Duncan. With Duncan&#x27;s help, Scott becomes Xavier&#x27;s ward and the first official recruit of the original X-Men, a team of mutant heroes trained to stop mutant terrorists. Jean Grey joins this same team weeks later. Sinister continues to monitor Scott somewhat but keeps his distance so the telepathic Xavier and the other X-Men don&#x27;t become aware of and interfere with his plans. Not long afterward, Mr. Sinister hires the villains Blob and Kraven the Hunter to fight and wound each of the X-Men. This results in a battle that draws the attention of the teenage hero Spider-Man. Kraven then brings the blood samples of the X-Men and Spider-Man back to Sinister for study, even providing a sample of his own DNA.

Mr. Sinister concludes that offspring of Jean Grey and Scott Summers could represent the ultimate stage of mutant potential, possibly a mutant capable of destroying Apocalypse. Using Jean Grey&#x27;s cell sample, Mr. Sinister creates a clone who is rapidly aged. When the clone shows no sign of the X-gene, Sinister leaves her in a hibernation chamber. Years later, Jean Grey suffers catastrophic radiation poisoning but is saved by the cosmic Phoenix Force, who desires her to be a host. With her increased power, Jean creates a new body for her consciousness and the cosmic Phoenix Force to occupy, while creating a healing cocoon to repair the damage done to her original body. As &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Jean becomes a more powerful hero. She is later temporarily corrupted, causing the Phoenix Force itself to become a corrupt and deadly entity. The new &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; asserts control, burying Jean&#x27;s personality. Jean&#x27;s personality later resumes control and she eventually kills herself rather than allow Dark Phoenix to rise again and destroy more lives. Without a host, the Phoenix Force reverts to its original nature and feels remorse for its role in Jean&#x27;s death. To make amends, it restores Jean&#x27;s consciousness to her original body, now fully healed. Simultaneously, the Phoenix Force causes a spark of life in the Jean Grey clone Sinister created.

===Madelyne Pryor and Nathan Summers===
Deciding his clone may be useful after all, Sinister names her Madelyne Pryor (a joke on the fact that she was birthed from a &quot;prior existence&quot;, a cell sample taken from a previously existing person). Mr. Sinister gives &quot;Maddie&quot; false memories and documentation of a life where she is a pilot who survived a plane crash that occurred at the same time Jean Grey killed herself. After influencing her personality to be one that will appeal to Scott Summers and will also fall in love with him, Sinister arranges for Maddie to have a job working alongside Scott&#x27;s grandfather in Alaska. Unaware of her own true nature, Maddie meets Scott at a Summers family reunion. Seeing Maddie&#x27;s resemblance to Jean and hearing about the timing of her experience in a plane crash, Scott wonders if Pryor is somehow his first love reborn. Maddie admits to having feelings for Cyclops but insists she is her own person and must be seen as such rather than as a copy of Jean Grey. Scott concedes and over time the two fall in love, deciding to marry soon afterward. They have a son, Nathan Summers. While Christopher was Scott&#x27;s father&#x27;s name and Charles was Professor Xavier&#x27;s first name, it is later said that Sinister influenced Scott and Maddie to name their son Nathan Summers after him as well. Scott decides to leave behind the dangerous world of the X-Men so he can raise his family in peace in Anchorage, Alaska, nearby his own grandparents.

Studying the sewer-dwelling community known as the Morlocks, Mr. Sinister decides these mutants should not be allowed the chance to mix with the gene pool of other mutants and humans. His studies also reveal that several Morlocks bear signs of genetic manipulation based on his own research (due to Dark Beast&#x27;s experiments). Enraged that someone has used his &quot;signature&quot; without his permission, Sinister decides to wipe out the mutant Morlocks living beneath Manhattan. He hires the mutant thief Gambit (who has not yet time traveled and so considers this to be his first meeting with Sinister) to recruit a new team of Marauders who will work with Sabretooth and Scalphunter. In exchange, Mr. Sinister performs surgery on Gambit to correct a defect that would have ensured the mutant thief would one day lose control of his powers.

Before sending his Marauders against the Morlocks, Sinister learns the Avengers have discovered Jean Grey is alive and well in her cocoon. Sinister decides to seize the opportunity and at last kidnap Nathan Summers for experimentation. When Scott Summers learns of Jean&#x27;s reappearance, Sinister mentally influences him to immediately leave Alaska to see for himself that it&#x27;s actually her, leaving his family behind and without protection. Sinister then continues his mental influence, causing Scott to abandon his family and remain in New York City with Jean and the other original X-Men recruits. The group of old friends decide to create a new team together called X-Factor. With Cyclops gone and occupied, Sinister sends his newly formed Marauders to attack the now vulnerable Summers house in Alaska. The Marauders attack Maddie and leave her for dead, then take Nathan Summers to the State Home for Foundlings. Meanwhile, Sinister erases all records of Maddie and arranges for the furniture from the house in Anchorage to be removed. Unbeknownst to Sinister, Maddie is taken to a hospital and survives, though she slips into a coma.

===&quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot;===
Returning to New York, the Marauders are finally sent after the Morlocks. Using his stealth and tracking skills, Gambit leads the group to the Morlock community but abandons the group when he learns they intend murder. The Marauders dismiss Gambit and begin their slaughter, causing the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; event, a series of battles that include the X-Men, the new X-Factor team, and other heroes such as Thor. Some of the Marauders are killed in action. Scanning the mind of Sabretooth, the X-Man called Psylocke learns the massacre was ordered by someone called &quot;Sinister&quot;, alerting the X-Men to his presence for the first time.

Soon afterward, Cyclops returns to Alaska to make amends with Maddie and be a father. Discovering the house is completely empty, he concludes Maddie left with Nathan, deliberately leaving no trace of where she might be. He is then confronted by Master Mold, the robot whose primary task is to create mutant-hunting Sentinels. During the battle, Master Mold refers to Cyclops as one of &quot;the Twelve&quot; who must be destroyed. Later on, Master Mold explains the Twelve are &quot;The dozen mutant humans who will one day rise up and lead all of mutantkind in war against &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in the twilight of Earth.&quot;

Months after Nathan&#x27;s kidnapping, Maddie awakes from her coma, amnesiac. After regaining her memory, she contacts and reunites with the X-Men. Now bitter and increasingly desperate regarding her missing child, Maddie believes Scott completely abandoned them and never cared enough to contact her or look for her. She later joins forces with the demons S&#x27;ym and N&#x27;Astirh who take advantage of her state of mind and corrupt her, turning her into the Goblyn Queen and leading into the &quot;Inferno&quot; storyline. During this storyline, the mutant precog Irene Adler (now calling herself Destiny) sends the X-Factor team to Sinister&#x27;s lab where they discover and rescue Nathan along with other children. The Goblyn Queen then arrives and retrieves Nathan and several other babies to use as sacrifices for a demonic ritual.

Sinister reforms his Marauders, even resurrecting the fallen ones through his now perfected cloning technology. He then confronts Madelyne and reveals her true origins. At the end of Inferno, Maddie dies and her life-force and memories merge with Jean Grey&#x27;s. As the X-Factor and X-Men teams fight Sinister, the villain reveals his many manipulations of Scott Summers over the years, how he mentally influenced Scott to abandon his family, and his quest to create offspring from his and Jean&#x27;s DNA. After realizing the villainous scientist may be vulnerable to his power, Cyclops releases a high-intensity blast that seems to atomize Mr. Sinister, leaving only charred bones. The battle over, Scott and Jean decide to raise the baby Nathan together. In truth, Mr. Sinister is alive, having decided to fake his death so he can retreat rather than continue to battle both X-Factor and the X-Men single-handedly.

Later on, Nathan is fatally infected by a techno-organic virus. Rather than watch his son die, Cyclops sends him into the future where treatment exists. Soon afterward, Gambit joins the X-Men team after having befriended the X-Man called Storm. His connection to Sinister and the Mutant Massacre is not revealed for some time. Many months after Nathan Summers is sent into the future, the X-Men learn he grew up to become Cable, a powerful mutant time traveler and one of Apocalypse&#x27;s most persistent enemies. This also makes the mutant terrorist Stryfe a son of Cyclops in his own way, as he is a clone of Cable.

===1990s===
Sinister recruits a new team of agents called the Nasty Boys and allies with Stryfe, now leader of the terrorist Mutant Liberation Front. During this time, he establishes a new cover identity of &quot;Mike Milbury&quot;, a neighbor to Scott Summers&#x27; grandparents. During the storyline &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, Stryfe gives Sinister a canister he claims contains a sample of his own genetic material, in exchange for a service. When Sinister opens the container, he is angered to find it seemingly empty. He later realizes that he unknowingly unleashed the Legacy Virus, a pathogen engineered by Stryfe that targets mutants. Not long afterward, Scott Summers meets Mike Milbury, who then reveals himself to be Mr. Sinister, still alive. Sinister warns of the Legacy Virus and also hints that there is a third Summers brother unknown to either Scott or Alex. When the villainous Dark Riders arrive to attack Cyclops, Sinister declares the mutant hero under his own protection. Not long afterward, Scott and Jean Grey marry while Sinister monitors from afar, interested in the possible offspring that may result. Some time later, he recruits a new agent named Threnody, a mutant who can sense the dying and draw energy from them.

Not long after Scott and Jean&#x27;s wedding, the X-Men learn that due to an alteration to history, their reality is about to be replaced by another. Believing they are about to die, the X-Man Rogue kisses her teammate Gambit, something she had not done before due to the risk that her energy absorbing abilities could harm him. During the kiss, she sees his memories and learns of his past relationship with Mr. Sinister. The alteration to the timeline is due to Xavier&#x27;s powerful mutant son Legion traveling back in time to kill Magneto before the X-Men have even formed, but accidentally killing Charles Xavier instead. This creates a new &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality where Apocalypse conquers much of the Western hemisphere and Magneto forms his own team of X-Men rebels, naming them in honor of his fallen friend Charles. In this reality, Sinister helps Apocalypse rule, adopts both Alex and Scott Summers as his personal soldiers, and recruits Henry McCoy (Dark Beast) as his lab assistant. Believing Apocalypse will ultimately destroy the Earth in his quest to eliminate the weak, Sinister still works to create a living weapon against him using DNA from Scott Summers and Jean Grey. The result is a powerful teenage mutant named Nate Grey.

Later on, the timeline is restored. Rogue is disturbed by Gambit&#x27;s connection to Sinister, which is later revealed to the rest of the X-Men. This drives a wedge between them and Gambit for some time.

The Age of Apocalypse reality is seemingly erased but some of its inhabitants are transported to the original timeline. Dark Beast is transported to the past and experiments on several Morlocks. Nate Grey winds up in the modern day Marvel Universe, appearing on Earth only days after the X-Men thought their world would wink out of existence. Learning of Nate Grey and his similarity to Cable, Sinister assigns Threnody to earn the young man&#x27;s trust. When Threnody develops genuine friendship with Nate and decides to leave Sinister&#x27;s employ, the Marauders are sent after her. Nate Grey intervenes, killing the entire team except for Prism (though Sinister later clones the fallen again).

===2000s===
Apocalypse gathers the Twelve, now revealed to be twelve powerful mutants he can use to ascend to a god-like state of power, with Nate Grey acting as a new host. After this plan fails, Sinister takes on the appearance of an elderly man, &quot;Dr. Essex&quot;, and visits the High Evolutionary. He influences the powerful geneticist to use his advanced space station to remove the powers of all mutants on Earth, causing widespread injury and several deaths, including most of the community of evolved mutants known as the Neo. Sinister then reveals his true nature and takes over the High Evolutionary&#x27;s satellite, intending to use it to alter the genetics of people at his discretion, making Earth a giant lab where he could create the ultimate race of superhumans. Sinister&#x27;s plan is then stopped by the X-Men, who restore mutant powers to all of those with the X-gene. The surviving Neo then hunt Sinister to avenge their fallen members, killing 17 clone doppelgangers. Sinister later resurfaces as Dr. Robert Windsor, experimenting on mutants again, with Scalphunter acting as his bodyguard. Later on, an encounter with Colossus and the hero&#x27;s brother Mikhail Rasputin reveals that Sinister&#x27;s powers are weakening and he is becoming desperate to find a way to restore them.

Due to the event known as M-Day, most mutants lose their powers overnight and it seems there are no new mutant births occurring on Earth. Later on, a mutant named Joe Buggs is murdered by a mysterious mutant hunter. His friend Ed seeks the X-Men for help, claiming the killer is Kraven the Hunter (believed dead at the time). The X-Men consult with Spider-Man, Kraven&#x27;s greatest enemy, and the heroes discover the true killer is Sinister&#x27;s later creation, Xraven, a telepathic hunter. Realizing Xraven believes he is Sinister&#x27;s &quot;favorite son,&quot; Cyclops invites the hunter to read his own mind. Seeing Cyclops&#x27; memories of Sinister&#x27;s obsession with him and learning the scientists treats all of his soldiers and creations like pawns, Xraven flees but takes DNA samples of the X-Men Shadowcat, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine. Later, Mister Sinister tells Xraven he plans to create a new generation of mutants through cloning. Realizing Sinister will enslave these mutants, Xraven destroys the samples and causes the destruction of Sinister&#x27;s lab and hideout. Sinister survives, but Xraven&#x27;s fate is unknown. During the storyline Blinded by the Light, Sinister sends the Marauders and Acolytes to murder all those who have knowledge of the future. 

Some time later, the first new mutant since M-Day is born. Sinister sends agents to kidnap the child in the storyline &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex.&quot; Later, Sinister (whose powers are still weakened) is confronted by Mystique, who presses the villain&#x27;s face against an unconscious Rogue. Rogue&#x27;s energy absorption abilities are amplified at the time, causing her skin-to-skin contact with Sinister to kill the villain almost instantaneously.

====Miss Sinister====

Thanks to using the Cronus Device decades earlier to implant his own genetic information into the Marko, Ryking, Shaw, and Xavier family lines, Sinister&#x27;s consciousness is able to inhabit Charles Xavier&#x27;s body following his death at Mystique&#x27;s hands. Sebastian Shaw and Gambit destroy the machine, enabling Xavier to drive out Sinister&#x27;s consciousness. A fail-safe plan allows Sinister&#x27;s consciousness to then activate within former test subject Claudine Renko, whose body then transforms to mimic Sinister&#x27;s powers and genetics but with female sex characteristics. Although she gains some of Sinister&#x27;s memories and his knowledge of science, Renko&#x27;s personality remains intact and resists Sinister&#x27;s personality. Seeing herself as a different person rather than a host or a clone, Renko takes the name Miss Sinister.

Gambit and Laura Kinney, a young woman known as X-23, who was cloned from Wolverine&#x27;s DNA, encounter a girl named Alice, who introduces them to her owner/adoptive mother, Miss Sinister. Renko explains Alice is also a clone, the fourth of a series created by Essex as one of several experiments involving children held in a desert lab. Renko explains Sinister&#x27;s mind is like a virus attempting to overtake her. She hopes to maintain her own mind by switching bodies with X-23. The plan backfires when Essex&#x27;s mind telepathically takes control of X-23 and uses her to mortally wound Renko. Laura overcomes Essex&#x27;s presence, then escapes the lab with Alice and Gambit, freeing the other children test subjects in the process. In the wreckage left behind, Claudine Renko lives, looked over by a fifth Alice clone who now contains Mr. Sinister&#x27;s consciousness in her mind.

Miss Sinister is next seen in the company of the reality displaced X-Men of a now-dead universe. One member of this team, Jimmy Hudson, has a genetic anomaly that could enable Renko to create and control spontaneous mutation. Over the following months, Renko further researches this anomaly, calling it Mothervine, for the purpose of controlling mutant childbirths, causing further evolution in natural-born mutants, and triggering mutation in non-mutants. Though she realizes the secondary and primary mutations caused by such tampering are debilitating to the point of being lethal, Renko works with Bastion, Emma Frost, and Havok to unleash Mothervine on a global scale.

Mothervine bombs containing the catalyst are launched into a dozen major American cities resulting in the emergence of primary mutations in people that didn&#x27;t possess the X-Gene, as well as the appearance of secondary and tertiary enhancements in mutants. The time-displaced X-Men attack but are quickly defeated and captured. Seeing the damage done by Mothervine and realizing all mutants may become enslaved to Miss Sinister, Emma Frost telepathically forces the New Marauders to fight Renko. Miss Sinister activates genetic implants in the New Marauders, killing them instantly. Emma Frost frees Jimmy Hudson from his metal restraints, and he seemingly slays Miss Sinister. The effects of Mothervine are then contained and reversed by Magneto and Elixir.

===2010s===

Mister Sinister is eventually able to fully possess the fifth clone of Alice, returning in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #544. Now dressed in Victorian-era garb and using knowledge gained from Apocalypse, he merges with the alien giant known as the Dreaming Celestial, gaining great power. Sinister turns San Francisco&#x27;s residents into doppelgangers of himself and attempts to create a society resembling 19th century England, which he claims to now see as a perfect culture. His true plan is to gain the attention of the alien Celestials so they might deem humanity too chaotic and then eradicate the species, leaving him to rebuild the planet with a better version of humanity. The X-Men restore San Francisco and defeat Sinister, who loses his enhanced power.

Foreseeing the Phoenix Force will one day return to Earth, Sinister tells the young mutant Hope Summers about its existence, knowing she will be its choice for a new host. In truth, he intends to steal the Phoenix energy by using a group of Madelyne Pryor clones. When the Phoenix Force arrives on Earth during the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, its power is divided between five people, including Cyclops. The Phoenix Five track down Mister Sinister, learning he has built his own city (based on Victorian-era London) within Subterranea that is inhabited by clones of himself, several of his agents, and some acquaintances. Sinister orders his clones to war against the Phoenix Five. After help arrives, the Phoenix Five kill each and every clone of Sinister present.

In the aftermath of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men,&quot; Sinister visits Cyclops and explains that some time ago he killed the X-Men public relations manager Katie Kildare, placing his own personality in the woman&#x27;s mind while a secondary Sinister clone was left in charge of the city. While his clones and resources are gone, he still lives and will strike again. Sinister, now again in a cloned body of his old form, then infiltrates the X-Men&#x27;s original mansion home, recently renamed the Jean Grey School, through its student Ernst. Ernst provides Sinister access to DNA samples from the mutants within the school in exchange for providing her friend Martha Johannesen with a new body. His efforts are ultimately foiled by the students and Spider-Man, who was asked by Wolverine to help locate the school&#x27;s mole. Sinister escapes but his new DNA samples are destroyed.

===All New, All Different===
When the Inhuman city of Attilan is under attack, its leader Black Bolt releases Terrigen Mist across Earth, the same mutagenic agent derived from Terrigen crystals that unlock an Inhuman&#x27;s superhuman potential. This causes many humans with latent Inhuman genes (due to an ancestor) to discover new powers. It also proves deadly to mutants after sustained exposure. Mister Sinister experiments on unwilling subjects to see if Inhuman and mutant DNA together can create a genetically superior species. His tests prove such a species would be unstable. After witnessing the death of a test subject that is a copy of Cyclops, Sinister is defeated by the X-Men and taken to the authorities.

During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Mister Sinister&#x27;s cell samples of Logan are stolen by a thief who attempts to auction them off. Sinister attacks the thief but is then fought by X-23, who forces him to retreat. The auction attendees are evacuated to South Korea&#x27;s National Intelligence Service Helicarrier as Iron Man, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, and X-23 interrogate the seller Declan Fay. He directs them to the Kerguelen Islands where Mister Sinister has collected the genetic make-up of every person on Earth. Sinister reveals a kill team recently stole his work. The heroes then destroy his database before leaving. Soon after this, Sinister becomes highly interested in Iceman&#x27;s increased power and control.

===The Quiet Council===
In the 2019 &quot;Powers of X&quot; series, it is revealed that at some point in the past, Sinister created his first clone community on an island in the South Pacific, calling it Bar Sinister. While here, he is approached by Professor Xavier and Magneto regarding his collection of DNA samples. Xavier asks Sinister to prioritize cataloging mutant DNA to create a comprehensive database that would be safe, secure, and redundant. In exchange, he offers to provide samples Sinister would have trouble getting on his own. The lead Mister Sinister clone is not interested in the deal but is suddenly killed by another Sinister clone who has a functional X-gene, making him a mutant too. This Sinister clone becomes leader of the community and agrees to have his memories of this deal and encounter telepathically repressed until the day Xavier and Magneto tell him to remember.

It is apparently this version of Sinister, or another X-gene clone with his memories, who survived the slaughter of the Phoenix Five. This meeting between the mutant Sinister clone, Magneto, and Xavier may have taken place soon before the first X-Men team was formed (in which case, the mutant Sinister has been the primary version the X-Men have fought over the years), or during the early 1980s era of X-Men stories (during which time Magneto and Xavier sometimes acted as allies again and before Xavier regained the ability to walk from 1983 to 1991), or during the early or late 1990s era of stories (indicated by Xavier using a Shi&#x27;ar hover chair he started using in 1991, Moira MagTaggert&#x27;s journal claiming the meeting happened before her apparent death in 2001, and Magneto operating openly as he did from 1990 to 1991 and from 1997 to 2001, whereas he was believed dead from 1992 to 1993, was catatonic from 1993 to 1995, and was operating in secret as Erik the Red from 1995 to 1997). The existence of this mutant version of Sinister helps explain why the villain is classified as an &quot;Alpha-level mutant&quot; in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #94 (1999) despite previous stories establishing Nathaniel Essex was born a human without an X-gene and was granted powers by Apocalypse using alien technology.

Sometime later, along with other mutants, the X-gene Sinister is welcomed to the new mutant community existing on the island Krakoa. At the invitation of Xavier, Magneto and Apocalypse, he joins the Quiet Council that governs Krakoa, agreeing to not continue his schemes to harvest the DNA of mutants. In Marvel&#x27;s 2019 relaunch of its X-Men franchise, &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, Sinister finds himself already bored with his new status on Krakoa, and decides to resume his schemes by utilizing a loophole in the Quiet Council rules. To begin, he starts a file concerning Franklin Richards, the mutant son of Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman.

===The Moira Engine===
After the Quiet Council became aware of Moira&#x27;s secret alliance with Professor X and Magneto, and her mutant power to reincarnate and reset the timeline upon her death with all the knowledge of all her past lives, Mister Sinister created another top-secret lab unbeknownst to his fellow Council members, where he&#x27;s still meddling with cloning technology. Interested in exploiting Moira&#x27;s power, he created several clones of Moira MacTaggert. After extracting all knowledge from the clones and a way to activate the X-Gene in them, he can now, when something goes wrong, upload all of his knowledge of what happened and then kills a Moira clone, resetting the timeline to the moment the clone was created and deliver that information to his earlier self. Sinister checks in on the Moira clones, every day, to see if any of them have new information uploaded. Basically, if his future self reset the timeline, the Moira he made will have new information for him because she reset back to the time he made her. Due to the sophistication of Moira&#x27;s mutant ability, each clone could only be used up to 10 times. He says he has done this 25 times, so we are on the 26th life of clone Moira.

====Essex genetic templates====
&quot;Immortal X-Men&quot; #8 (January 2023), which opens in 1895 London, shows that the powers that Apocalypse gave Essex were slowly deteriorating and killing him, and to survive he needed to feast upon the flesh of innocent people who he killed, prompting two long-lived mutants, Mystique (Sherlock Holmes/Raven Darkhölme) and Destiny (Irene Adler) to confront and imprison him. Essex told the two women that Apocalypse did grant him the power to see the future, including major developments in the 20th and 21st centuries such as the escalation of the scale of war and the rise of the machines as the dominant beings on the planet. After Mystique secretly kills Essex in his cell, covering up her crime in her Holmes form, Destiny finds in a basement level, four human-sized tanks, each one marked with one of the four suits found on playing cards, smashed open and empty. As it turns out, Essex had envisioned four possible routes that could be explored as a solution to the ascension of the artificial intelligence: the potential of mankind itself, the wonders of space beyond the stars, the mystical knowledge beyond the understanding of machine mind and the Essex-men themselves.

===Sins of Sinister===
By using Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s mutant gift to reset reality repeatedly, Sinister continuously tried and attack the Quiet Council. After many tries, he finally manages to kill Charles Xavier, Hope, Exodus, and Emma Frost, and the next stage of his plan is put into motion. As the four council members who died were resurrected, its revealed that Sinister had actually corrupted the resurrection process and they are now under the control of Sinister. Slowly, Sinister manipulates the council to give the gift of immortality to the world by giving people an X-Gene. Through this X-Gene, they could be resurrected but also fall under the control of Sinister. Over the next few years, the mutants of Krakoa dismantle Orchis, the Avengers, and even the living tree of Krakoa but Storm realizes something is amiss. Since she deleted her resurrection protocols, she was not subjected to Sinister&#x27;s manipulation. Retreating to Arakko, she prepared for war, which she ultimately lost but is still at large. Sinister continues his science experiments and creates mutant chimeras to increase his army. However, the council is worried about alien forces trying to take them out, especially with Storm at large. Sinister decides to redo the timeline and heads to his lab to use Moira&#x27;s mutant gene, only to find his lab missing.

===Fall of X and the Enigma Dominion===
While Sinister was trapped within the Pit, the genetic code he had implanted into the assassinated council members was nullified by Forge, with one key exception; Professor X, whom Sinister had experimented on as a child. As Krakoa was destroyed by Orchis, with mutantkind scattered, the part of Sinister within Xavier began looking for ways to overcome its host, and began piloting his body while he slept, simultaneously working on a way to fight the Sinister Dominion. After Xavier discovered the truth, Sinister revealed himself to him. He opened his mind to Xavier and managed to convince him not to kill himself and to work together with Sinister to stop the Dominion.

Xavier and Sinister eventually discover the truth behind the four Nathaniel Essex Sinister clones; they were all created to absorb data, leading to the birth of a 5th &quot;child&quot; of Nathaniel Essex: an &quot;apex AI&quot; called Enigma, the same force revealed that stands above all creation, and is coming to end Eternity, the personification of the Multiverse.

In truth, years ago, Essex decided the only way to defeat the coming machine supremacy was to join them, creating his own all-powerful artificial intelligence, which is where Enigma comes in. Enigma - using a Crown symbol similar to a card deck&#x27;s King - is the 5th &quot;child&quot; of Essex, an AI that was able to reach Dominion outside time and space after all four clones attempted to reach said status, got incredibly close, and then failed to ascend.

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of undergoing genetic engineering at the hands of Apocalypse, the original Mister Sinister gained, as revealed in &quot;Immortal X-Men&quot; #8, precognitive powers that granted him the power to see the future, including major developments in the 20th century such as the escalation of the scale of war. However these powers were slowly killing him. By the late twentieth century, Sinister&#x27;s mind had been copied into the bodies of others, as well as clones of his own creation. Since no clone is completely perfect on a cellular level, some differences emerged in their biology and personality. At least one clone of Mr. Sinister developed the X-gene in his DNA. This mutant version of Mr. Sinister became the leader of the many versions of the clone community in the 2019 &quot;Powers of X&quot; miniseries, and has been the primary Sinister to encounter the X-Men since.

Mister Sinister has the ability to shape-shift from a humanoid form to an amorphous one.

Sinister is an expert at genetic manipulation and a skilled surgeon.

On rare occasions, Mister Sinister has exhibited the ability to teleport, but it was indicated that this was not an inherent power and was accomplished through the technology of his tesseract headquarters.

==Clones of Mister Sinister==
Nathaniel Essex cloned himself, and members of his original family, many times. In addition to countless Mister Sinister variations are several unique clones.

===Doctor Stasis===
Doctor Stasis is a clone of Mister Sinister with a suit of clubs on his forehead, who dedicated his life to unlocking the full potential of humans rather than mutants. Flashbacks reveal that he was involved in experiments leading to the origins of Captain America, Hulk and Spider-Man, among others. Like Sinister, Stasis heavily employs clones, using animal chimeras as servants and having dinners with disposable clones of his late wife and sons. In the present day, he became the director of the Orchis Petal of Human Resources. As a precaution to protect himself from psychic attacks, Doctor Stasis wears a full mask over his head.

===Orbis Stellaris===
Orbis Stellaris is a clone of Mister Sinister with a suit of spades on his forehead who became an intergalactic arms dealer and used alien technology to prolong his life. He took over the World Farm and later clashed with S.W.O.R.D.

===Enigma===
First mentioned as a force that stands above all creation and a serious threat to the Marvel Universe which forced the Beyonders to orchestrate the destruction of the Seventh Cosmos through the Molecule Man and the Incursions. A glimpse of the Enigma was first seen by Loki after he survived the destruction of the Seven Cosmos, and before he landed in Taaia&#x27;s Sixth Cosmos. The God of Stories describes it as &quot; the Crown Above All Things,&quot; a menace from beyond the threshold of time, beyond the Multiverse itself. Enigma is actually Nathanial Essex&#x27;s 5th &quot;child&quot;, an &quot;apex AI&quot; which used the other four Nathaniel Essex clones to achieve Dominion.

===Mother Righteous===
Unlike the previously mentioned entities, Mother Righteous is not a clone of Essex himself, but of his deceased wife Rebecca. She is a supremely skilled magic-user and collector of magical artefacts. and a vicious dealer for sorcerous favors with persons like Margali Szardos and Selene.

==Reception==

In 2017, &quot;WhatCulture&quot; ranked Mister Sinister 4th in their &quot;10 Most Evil X-Men Villains&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Mister Sinister 4th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline of the 1995–96 &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, Nathaniel Essex is one of Apocalypse&#x27;s Four Horsemen, making him one of the ruling council that oversees the villain&#x27;s dominion. He calls himself simply &quot;Sinister&quot; rather than &quot;Mr. Sinister.&quot; In this world where Earth&#x27;s general population became aware of the power and abundance of mutants over a decade earlier than they would have otherwise, Sinister does not bother with manipulating Alex and Scott Summers from the shadows via his orphanage. Instead, he adopts them directly after they are orphaned, becoming their foster father, encouraging their training as warriors and teaching them that their mutant genes place them above the non-mutant &quot;flat scans&quot; who inhabit the Earth. Scott becomes Sinister&#x27;s obvious favorite son, creating great resentment and animosity in Alex. Later on, Sinister recruits the amoral scientist Hank McCoy, the Dark Beast, as his lab assistant. Though impressed with Dark Beast&#x27;s abilities, Sinister is disturbed and at times angry with McCoy&#x27;s habit of enhancing and altering mutations just for the enjoyment of seeing the results, rather than having a true purpose or benefit for his research.

As the years go on, Cyclops comes to doubt the path of Apocalypse. Though publicly he enforces Sinister&#x27;s will, fighting criminals and rebels such as that timeline&#x27;s X-Men, in secret he aids humans and others who need to escape Apocalypse&#x27;s territory or Sinister&#x27;s holding pens. Unknown to Cyclops, his &quot;father&quot; Sinister is disillusioned with Apocalypse&#x27;s empire, convinced the mutant conqueror&#x27;s actions will simply cause the destruction of Earth eventually, leaving no possibility for a master race to live. Wishing a living weapon he can use against Apocalypse, Sinister clones a powerful mutant from the combined genetic codes of Scott Summers and the X-Man rebel named Jean Grey. Sinister names the genetically engineered boy &quot;Nathan Grey&quot;, deciding that while Jean Grey was the boy&#x27;s mother, he himself was the father. Sinister accelerates Nathan&#x27;s aging and the boy quickly becomes a teenager, his mutant X-gene granting him incredible telekinetic and telepathic power. Realizing the boy&#x27;s raw power could easily burn out his life and body prematurely, Sinister becomes desperate to gain full control of Nathan&#x27;s mind and abilities to use him as a weapon. One night, not knowing the boy&#x27;s intended purpose or their connection to each other, Cyclops finds and frees Nathan Grey from Sinister&#x27;s secret lab in the Blightlands. Before Cyclops can lead him to safety, the impulsive teenager immediately unleashes his power and leaves on his own, eventually meeting a group of traveling entertainers called the Outcasts, led by the mutant inventor Forge. The Outcasts accept &quot;Nate&quot; into their ranks.

Realizing his creation has fled, Sinister abandons his labs to quickly recapture Nate before he is discovered and killed, knowing Apocalypse will consider his sudden departure a sign of betrayal regardless. Changing his appearance and calling himself simply &quot;Essex,&quot; Sinister joins the Outcasts and is present when they are attacked by Apocalypse&#x27;s assassin Domino. When Forge realizes that Essex has a dark plan for Nate, Sinister kills him and reveals himself. Sinister explains Nate&#x27;s origin and purpose to be the destroyer of Apocalypse. Nate defeats and dismisses Sinister, choosing to be an individual rather than a weapon. He then leaves to face Apocalypse on his own which then leads to Nate Grey being transported into the original timeline of the mainstream Marvel Universe.

In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; 10th anniversary limited series, Sinister collected the seemingly dead Jean Grey after discovering that it was her connection to the Phoenix Force that saved the world from annihilation. When Magneto was credited with saving the planet, Sinister confronted him and revealed the truth. With Magneto now the head of the Department of Mutant Affairs, Sinister blackmailed him to keep his X-Men away even though Sinister was wanted for war crimes.

The X-Men still attempted to hunt down Sinister, unaware that their leader was secretly avoiding this outcome. The truth came out when Paige Guthrie, an X-Man abandoned by her mentors during a mission, attempted to get her revenge on them. Her dying words exposed Magneto&#x27;s duplicity. After explaining the situation to his X-Men, Magneto and the others found Sinister hidden on Liberty Island. He faced the X-Men with his minions the Sinister Six, which included Cloak and Dagger, Sonique, Sauron, Blob and Jean Grey herself.

In the final battle, Jean broke free from Sinister&#x27;s control and bombarded him with the Phoenix energy, heavily charing his body. Sinister was impaled by both Weapon X and Kirika, slaying him.

===Mutant X===
In the alternate universe of the series &quot;Mutant X&quot;, Mr. Sinister is responsible for Christopher Summers and his wife Katherine Anne Summers meeting, ensuring that the powerful mutants Cyclops and Havok would be born. Sinister joins forces with a villainous Xavier and clashes with this reality&#x27;s version of Apocalypse, who becomes allies with Jean Grey and Magneto. Sinister and Xavier create the clone Madelyne Pryor, guiding her to meet and fall in love with Havok, leading to a son named Scotty. Sinister also creates another Summers clone called X-Man (a version of Nate Grey). He and Xavier hope to control the evolution of humanity, but Sinister turns on Xavier when he realizes the telepath has his own agenda. Xavier kills Sinister but his plans are then stopped by that reality&#x27;s heroes and the Havok of the mainstream Marvel timeline.

===X-Men: The End===
A trilogy of mini-series under the banner &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; was published from 2004 to 2006, taking place in a possible future timeline, roughly &quot;fifteen years&quot; forward from where the X-Men stories were in 2004. Sinister is featured in the first mini-series, and then in the second mini-series he blackmails Gambit into bringing him the children of Scott Summers and Emma Frost as well as his own children that he conceived with Rogue. Sinister reveals Gambit is not a natural-born mutant but actually a clone of himself with some of Cyclops&#x27;s DNA imprinted into his code. The purpose had been to create a &quot;son&quot; with Cyclops&#x27;s abilities. Knowing Sinister&#x27;s plan to transplant his own mind into this potentially powerful mutant form, Apocalypse arranged for the boy to be kidnapped and then sent to be raised by the Thieves Guild in New Orleans.

Growing up, Gambit only developed a variation of Scott&#x27;s powers, giving him red eyes and the ability to charge things with explosive force instead of releasing great kinetic force from his body. Taking on Gambit&#x27;s appearance, Sinister kills Rogue when she arrives to rescue the children. In the end, Rogue&#x27;s adopted mother Mystique murders Sinister in vengeance.

===Earth X===
In &quot;Paradise X&quot;, an alternate universe first introduced in the 1999 miniseries &quot;Earth X&quot;, an older Colossus reveals that he was Mister Sinister all along. After years with the X-Men, he fell in love with Jean Grey and then traveled back in time to learn how to preserve her as a clone, leading to his transformation into the psychopathic geneticist Mr. Sinister who then fought the X-Men, including his younger self.

===Ultimate Marvel===

In the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; series, taking place in the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Nathaniel Essex is reimagined as a heavily tattooed street thug nicknamed &quot;Sinister&quot; due to his tattoo. He is a former OsCorp scientist who experiments on himself after failing to perfect his formula on stealth and mind-altering drugs to create a super-soldier who could evade any form of detection and hypnotically persuade others. He seemingly suffers from hallucinations of a being called &quot;Lord Apocalypse&quot; who orders him to kill a number of mutants to complete his transformation. After committing suicide in the Triskelion, Sinister returns to life and transforms into the Ultimate Marvel version of Apocalypse himself, battling an armored Cable and Professor X in his Onslaught form. However, the Phoenix Force appears and destroys his form.

After the &quot;Ultimatum Wave&quot;, he reforms his body and gets a job at Roxxon as part of their &quot;brain trust&quot;. He then allies with Layla Miller and the two embark on a mission to find four specific mutants, at least one of whom is Alex Summers. Their mission and full agenda never come into fruition, as the entire Ultimate Universe soon ends due to a universal incursion depicted in the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event.

===X-Men Forever===

The 2009 series &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; (vol. 2) featured stories and canon Chris Claremont would have established had he continued working on the X-Men comics after 1991. In the 2010 sequel series &quot;X-Men Forever 2&quot;, Nathaniel Essex is a mutant who is over a century old but stuck in the body of a ten-year-old child. Reasoning that no one would be intimidated by his true appearance, Essex uses creates the robot Mr. Sinister, using it as an avatar to command the Marauders.

In this timeline, mutants do not live long lives (with rare exceptions) because their mutant abilities cause &quot;burn-out&quot; in their bodies, leading to death later on (which happens earlier if more power is used as they approach middle age). Essex&#x27;s genetic research and interest in the X-Men is because he believes they may be a key to finding a cure for X-gene burn-out.

Sinister&#x27;s Mauraders attack Cyclops&#x27;s family in Alaska, including his son Nate. In this reality, Sabretooth joins the X-Men after Wolverine is killed, but Sinister then clones both of them to create Marauder versions loyal to him. After the Marauders are defeated, Cyclops and Nate befriend a new neighbor named Robyn, who is actually one of Sinister&#x27;s agents. The series ends before resolving this storyline.

===1602===
In the &quot;1602&quot; reality, Lord Nathaniel Essex is a former advisor to King James II, revealed to be a witchbreed murderer of women. He was caught by witch hunters Angela and Lady Serah.

<text>Richard Baer (9 September 1911 – 17 June 1963) was a German SS officer who, among other assignments, was the final commandant of Auschwitz I concentration camp from May 1944 to January 1945, and right after, from February to April 1945, commandant of Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Following the war, Baer lived under an assumed name to avoid prosecution but was recognized and arrested in December 1960. He died in detention before he could stand trial.

== Life ==
Born in Floss, Bavaria in 1911, Baer grew up in a Protestant family. In 1925, he moved to Weiden in der Oberpfalz, where he performed a three-year apprenticeship to become a pastry chef. After completing his vocational training, Baer toured Bavaria for several years as a journeyman. Eventually, in the winter of 1932, he returned to the pastry company of his apprenticeship and worked there until he resigned in March 1933.

Baer signed on with the Nazi Party in 1930, and on 1 July 1932, he became a member of the Allgemeine SS.
In the local SS post in Weiden, he met the future concentration camp commandant Martin Gottfried Weiss. Under the direction of Weiss, a small SS gang offered protection to speakers at weekend public meetings of the Nazi Party in the surrounding villages.
Baer later stated that he had joined the Allgemeine SS because he liked the &quot;soldier discipline&quot; and the &quot;joy of playing soldiers&quot;.

After the Nazis came to power, most of the SS men in Weiden served as auxiliary police officers locally and, as early as mid-April 1933, they were assigned as guards to the Dachau concentration camp, where Baer was subject to military drills, Nazi ideological indoctrination, and hard training in systematic techniques for the terrorisation of prisoners. His teacher was Theodor Eicke, the camp commandant since June 1933 and shaper of the so-called &quot;Dachau Model&quot; of the Nazi concentration camp system. Baer described the training for guard duty in Dachau as being &quot;very strict&quot; and &quot;sharply polished&quot;: &quot;The more we were polished, the more proud we were of it&quot;.

From December 1934 to end-March 1935, Baer performed guard duty at the infamous Gestapo prison &quot;Columbia-Haus&quot; in Berlin. He was later assigned to the SS-Death&#x27;s Head (SS-TV) 2nd regiment &quot;Brandenburg&quot;, which in 1936 was involved in the build up of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After taking a platoon commander course in Oranienburg concentration camp, Baer served from March to September 1938 with the SS-TV 3rd regiment &quot;Thuringen&quot; in Buchenwald concentration camp. In September 1938, Baer was promoted to SS-second lieutenant (&quot;Untersturmführer&quot;) and, at the end of the same year, he headed the first group of guards in the newly established Neuengamme concentration camp, then still a sub-camp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In September 1940, he became a commando overseer.At the end of 1940, Baer asked to join the front line and, after completing a course to become a company commander, he was sent to the Eastern front. In December 1941, as a result of a wound, he was transferred back to Neuengamme concentration camp.

In 1942, Baer was appointed adjutant to the commandant of the Neuengamme concentration camp. At Neuengamme, he participated in the killing of Soviet prisoners-of-war in a special gas chamber and in the selection of prisoners for the so-called Operation 14f13 in the T4 Euthanasia Program.From November 1942 to May 1944, Baer was adjutant to Oswald Pohl, then chief of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. In November 1943, he took over the office DI (Central Office) in the Department D &quot;Concentration camps Inspectorate&quot;. He succeeded Arthur Liebehenschel, considered by Himmler to be too &quot;soft&quot; with the prisoners, as the third and final commandant of Auschwitz I from 11 May 1944, until the final dissolution of the camp in early 1945. 

From November 1943 until the end of 1944, Fritz Hartjenstein and Josef Kramer were responsible for the extermination camp in Auschwitz II-Birkenau, so Baer was only Commandant of that part of the camp from the end of 1944 until February 1945. Near the end of the war, having replaced Otto Förschner as commandant of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in Nordhausen, Baer was responsible for the mass execution of Soviet prisoners by hanging. His final rank was SS Major.

== Post-war ==
Baer returned to his home county at the end of the war and eventually settled near Hamburg, living as Karl Egon Neumann, a forestry worker. In the course of investigation during the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, a warrant for his arrest was issued in October 1960 and his photograph was printed in newspapers.

The story of Baer&#x27;s arrest is vividly recounted by Devin Pendas in his book &quot;The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial&quot;. After seeing a wanted picture in the tabloid newspaper &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;, a co-worker on &quot;Fürst&quot; von Bismarck&#x27;s estate reported that Baer was working as a forester there. When officials confronted &quot;Neumann&quot; on the early morning of 20 December 1960, he at first denied everything. Having already addressed Baer as her &quot;husband&quot;, the woman in the house subsequently gave her name as &quot;Frau Baer&quot;, but still claimed that Baer was named &quot;Neumann&quot;. However, Baer finally admitted his true identity. On the advice of his lawyer, Baer refused to testify. He died of a heart attack while in pre-trial detention in 1963.

<doc id="528218" wikidata="Q51782" url="?curid=528218" title="Calusa">
<text>The Calusa ( , Calusa: *ka(ra)luš(i)) were a Native American people of Florida&#x27;s southwest coast. Calusa society developed from that of archaic peoples of the Everglades region. Previous indigenous cultures had lived in the area for thousands of years.

At the time of European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries, the historic Calusa were the people of the Caloosahatchee culture. They developed a complex culture based on estuarine fisheries rather than agriculture. Their principal city of Calos was probably at Mound Key, and their territory reached from Charlotte Harbor to Cape Sable, all of present-day Charlotte, Lee, and Collier counties, and may have included the Florida Keys at times. They had the highest population density of South Florida; estimates of total population at the time of European contact range from 10,000 to several times that, but these are speculative.

Calusa political influence and control also extended over other tribes in southern Florida, including the Mayaimi around Lake Okeechobee, and the Tequesta and Jaega on the southeast coast of the peninsula. Calusa influence may have also extended to the Ais tribe on the central east coast of Florida. European contact caused their extinction, through disease and violence.

==Culture==
Early Spanish and French sources referred to the tribe, its chief town, and its chief as &quot;Calos&quot;, &quot;Calus&quot;, &quot;Caalus&quot;, and &quot;Carlos&quot;. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a Spaniard held captive by the Calusa in the 16th century, recorded that &quot;Calusa&quot; meant &quot;fierce people&quot; in their language. By the early 19th century, Anglo-Americans in the area used the term &quot;Calusa&quot; for the people. It is based on the Mvskoke and Mikasuki (languages of the present-day Seminole and Miccosukee nations) ethnonym for the people who had lived around the Caloosahatchee River (also from the Creek language).

Juan Rogel, a Jesuit missionary to the Calusa in the late 1560s, noted the chief&#x27;s name as Carlos, but wrote that the name of the kingdom was Escampaba, with an alternate spelling of &quot;Escampaha&quot;. Rogel also stated that the chief&#x27;s name was &quot;Caalus,&quot; and that the Spanish had changed it to &quot;Carlos.&quot; Marquardt quotes a statement from the 1570s that &quot;the Bay of Carlos ... in the Indian language is called Escampaba, for the cacique of this town, who afterward called himself Carlos in devotion to the Emperor&quot; (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor). &quot;Escampaba&quot; may be related to a place named &quot;Stapaba,&quot; which was identified in the area on an early 16th-century map.

==Origins==

Paleo-Indians entered what is now Florida at least 12,000 years ago. By around 5000 BC, people started living in villages near wetlands. Favored sites were likely occupied for multiple generations. Florida&#x27;s climate had reached current conditions, and the sea had risen close to its present level by about 3000 BC. People commonly occupied both fresh and saltwater wetlands. Because they relied on shellfish, they accumulated large shell middens during this period. Many people lived in large villages with ceremonial earthwork mounds, such as those at Horr&#x27;s Island. People began firing pottery in Florida by 2000 BC.

By about 500 BC, the Archaic culture, which had been fairly uniform across Florida, shifted into more distinct regional cultures. Some Archaic artifacts have been found in the region later occupied by the Calusa, including one site classified as early Archaic, and dated before 5000 BC. There is evidence that the people intensively exploited Charlotte Harbor aquatic resources before 3500 BC. Undecorated pottery belonging to the early Glades culture appeared in the region around 500 BC. Pottery distinct from the Glades tradition developed in the region around AD 500, marking the beginning of the Caloosahatchee culture. This lasted until about 1750, and included the historic Calusa people. By 880, a complex society had developed with high population densities. Later periods in the Caloosahatchee culture are defined in the archaeological record by the appearance of pottery from other traditions.

The Caloosahatchee culture inhabited the Florida west coast from Estero Bay to Charlotte Harbor and inland about halfway to Lake Okeechobee, roughly covering what are now Charlotte and Lee counties. At the time of first European contact, the Caloosahatchee culture region formed the core of the Calusa domain. Artifacts related to fishing changed slowly over this period, with no obvious breaks in tradition that might indicate a replacement of the population.

Between 500 and 1000, the undecorated, sand-tempered pottery that had been common in the area was replaced by Belle Glade Plain pottery. This was made with clay containing spicules from freshwater sponges (&quot;Spongilla&quot;), and it first appeared inland in sites around Lake Okeechobee. This change may have resulted from the people&#x27;s migration from the interior to the coastal region, or may reflect trade and cultural influences. Little change in the pottery tradition occurred after this. The Calusa were descended from people who had lived in the area for at least 1,000 years prior to European contact, and possibly for much longer than that.

==Society==

The Calusa had a stratified society, consisting of &quot;commoners&quot; and &quot;nobles&quot; in Spanish terms. While no evidence shows that the Calusa had institutionalized slavery, studies show they used captives for work or even sacrifice. A few leaders governed the tribe. They were supported by the labor of the majority of the Calusa. The leaders included the paramount chief or &quot;king&quot;, a military leader (&quot;capitán general&quot; in Spanish), and a chief priest. The capital of the Calusa, and from where the rulers administered, was Mound Key, near present day Estero, Florida. An eyewitness account from 1566 mentioned a &quot;king&#x27;s house&quot; on Mound Key that was large enough for &quot;2,000 people to stand inside.&quot; In 1564, according to a Spanish source, the priest was the chief&#x27;s father and the military leader was his cousin. The Spanish documented four cases of known succession to the position of paramount chief, recording most names in Spanish form. Senquene succeeded his brother (name unknown), and was in turn succeeded by his son Carlos. Carlos was succeeded by his cousin (and brother-in-law) Felipe, who was in turn succeeded by another cousin of Carlos, Pedro. The Spanish reported that the chief was expected to take his sister as one of his wives. The contemporary archeologists MacMahon and Marquardt suggest this statement may have been a misunderstanding of a requirement to marry a &quot;clan-sister&quot;. The chief also married women from subject towns and allied tribes. This use of marriages to secure alliances was demonstrated when Carlos offered his sister Antonia in marriage to Spanish explorer Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in 1566.

===Diet===
The Calusa diet at settlements along the coast and estuaries consisted primarily of fish, in particular pinfish (&quot;Lagodon rhomboides&quot;), pigfish (redmouth grunt), (&quot;Orthopristis chrysoptera&quot;), and hardhead catfish (&quot;Ariopsis felis&quot;). These small fish were supplemented by larger bony fish, sharks and rays, mollusks, crustaceans, ducks, sea turtles and land turtles, and land animals. When Pedro Menéndez de Avilés visited in 1566, the Calusa served only fish and oysters to the Spanish. An analysis of faunal remains at one coastal habitation site, the Wightman site (on Sanibel Island), showed that more than 93% of the energy from animals in the diet came from fish and shellfish, less than 6% of the energy came from mammals, and less than 1% came from birds and reptiles. By contrast, at an inland site, Platt Island, mammals (primarily deer) accounted for more than 60% of the energy from animal meat, while fish provided just under 20%.

Some authors have argued that the Calusa cultivated maize and &quot;Zamia integrifolia&quot; (coontie) for food, but Widmer argues that the evidence for maize cultivation by the Calusa depends on the proposition that the Narváez and de Soto expeditions landed in Charlotte Harbor rather than Tampa Bay, which is now generally discounted. No &quot;Zamia&quot; pollen has been found at any site associated with the Calusas, nor does &quot;Zamia&quot; grow in the wetlands that made up most of the Calusa environment. Marquardt notes that the Calusa turned down the offer of agricultural tools from the Spanish, saying that they had no need for them. The Calusa gathered a variety of wild berries, fruits, nuts, roots, and other plant parts. Widmer cites George Murdock&#x27;s estimate that only some 20% of the Calusa diet consisted of wild plants that they gathered. While no evidence of plant food was found at the Wightman site, archeological digs on Sanibel Island and Useppa Island revealed evidence that the Calusa did in fact consume wild plants such as cabbage palm, prickly pear, hog plum, acorns, wild papaya, and chili peppers. Also, evidence indicates that as early as 2,000 years ago, the Calusa cultivated a gourd of the species &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; and the bottle gourd, which were used for net floats and dippers.

===Tools===

The Calusa caught most of their fish with nets. Nets were woven with a standard mesh size; nets with different mesh sizes were used seasonally to catch the most abundant and useful fish available. The Calusa made bone and shell gauges that they used in net weaving. Cultivated gourds were used as net floats, and sinkers and net weights were made from mollusk shells. The Calusa also used spears, hooks, and throat gorges to catch fish. Well-preserved nets, net floats, and hooks were found at Key Marco, in the territory of the neighboring Muspa tribe.

Mollusk shells and wood were used to make hammering and pounding tools. Mollusk shells and shark teeth were used for grating, cutting, carving, and engraving. The Calusa wove nets from palm-fiber cord. Cord was also made from cabbage palm leaves, saw palmetto trunks, Spanish moss, false sisal (&quot;Agave decipiens&quot;), and the bark of cypress and willow trees. The Calusa also made fish traps, weirs, and fish corrals from wood and cord. Artifacts of wood that have been found include bowls, ear ornaments, masks, plaques, &quot;ornamental standards&quot;, and a finely carved deer head. The plaques and other objects were often painted. To date, no one has found a Calusa dugout canoe, but such vessels could have been constructed from cypress or pine, as used by other Florida tribes. The process of shaping the boat was achieved by burning the middle and subsequently chopping and removing the charred center, using robust shell tools. In 1954, a dugout canoe was found during excavation for a middle school in Marathon, Florida. Not conserved and in poor shape, the canoe is now displayed at the Crane Point Museum and Nature Center in Marathon and is tentatively attributed to the Calusa.

===Housing===
The Calusa lived in large communal houses, which were two stories high. When Pedro Menéndez de Avilés visited the capital in 1566, he described the chief&#x27;s house as large enough to hold 2,000 without crowding, indicating it also served as the council house. When the chief formally received Menéndez in his house, the chief sat on a raised seat surrounded by 500 of his principal men, while his sister-wife sat on another raised seat surrounded by 500 women. The chief&#x27;s house was described as having two big windows, suggesting that it had walls. Five friars who stayed in the chief&#x27;s house in 1697 complained that the roof let in the rain, sun, and dew. The chief&#x27;s house, and possibly the other houses at Calos, were built on top of earthen mounds. In a report from 1697, the Spanish noted 16 houses in the Calusa capital of Calos, which had 1,000 residents.

===Clothing and personal decoration===

The Calusa wore minimal clothing. The men wore deerskin breechcloths. The Spanish left less description about Calusa women&#x27;s attire. At the time, most Indigenous women of Florida wore skirts made from Spanish moss. The Calusa painted their bodies on a regular basis, but did not tattoo themselves. The men wore their hair long. The missionaries recognized that having a Calusa man cut his hair upon converting to Christianity (and European style) would be a great sacrifice. Little was recorded of jewelry or other ornamentation among the Calusa. During Menéndez de Avilés&#x27;s visit in 1566, the chief&#x27;s wife was described as wearing pearls, precious stones, and gold beads around her neck. The heir of the chief wore gold in an ornament on his forehead and beads on his legs.

Ceremonial or other artistic masks have been discovered and were previously described by the Spanish who first encountered the Calusa. Some of these masks had moving parts that used pull strings and hinges so that a person could alter the look of a mask while wearing it.

===Beliefs===
The Calusa believed that three supernatural beings ruled the world, that people had three souls, and that souls migrated to animals after death. The most powerful ruler governed the physical world, the second-most powerful ruled human governments, and the last helped in wars, choosing which side would win. The Calusa believed that the three souls were the pupil of a person&#x27;s eye, his shadow, and his reflection. The soul in the eye&#x27;s pupil stayed with the body after death, and the Calusa would consult with that soul at the graveside. The other two souls left the body after death and entered into an animal. If a Calusa killed such an animal, the soul would migrate to a lesser animal and eventually be reduced to nothing.

Calusa ceremonies included processions of priests and singing women. The priests wore carved masks, which were at other times hung on the walls inside a temple. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, an early chronicler of the Calusa, described &quot;sorcerers in the shape of the devil, with some horns on their heads,&quot; who ran through the town yelling like animals for four months at a time.

The Calusa remained committed to their belief system despite Spanish attempts to convert them to Catholicism. The &quot;nobles&quot; resisted conversion in part because their power and position were intimately tied to the belief system; they were intermediaries between the gods and the people. Conversion would have destroyed the source of their authority and legitimacy. The Calusa resisted physical encroachment and spiritual conversion by the Spanish and their missionaries for almost 200 years. After suffering decimation by disease, the tribe was destroyed by Creek and Yamasee raiders early in the 18th century.

Evidence shows that the Calusa buried their dead in mounds. After death, a body was placed in a charnel house to let the flesh fall away naturally, or in some cases, a medicine man with long fingernails would scrape the flesh from bone. Afterwards, the bones were gathered up, placed in a basket, and buried in a mound. These mounds were both for burials and religious ceremonies, as the Calusa gathered atop them on &quot;Holy Days to sacrifice aromatic plants and honey&quot;.

==Language==
==European contact==
The first recorded contact between the Calusa and Europeans was in 1513, when Juan Ponce de León landed on the west coast of Florida in May, probably at the mouth of the Caloosahatchee River, after his earlier discovery of Florida in April. The Calusa knew of the Spanish before this landing, however, as they had taken in Native American refugees from the Spanish subjugation of Cuba. The Spanish careened one of their ships, and Calusas offered to trade with them. After 10 days, a man who spoke Spanish approached Ponce de León&#x27;s ships with a request to wait for the arrival of the Calusa chief. Soon, 20 war canoes attacked the Spanish, who drove off the Calusa, killing or capturing several of them. The next day, 80 &quot;shielded&quot; canoes attacked the Spanish ships, but the battle was inconclusive. The Spanish departed and returned to Puerto Rico. In 1517, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba landed in southwest Florida on his return voyage from the Yucatán. He was also attacked by the Calusa. In 1521, Ponce de León returned to southwest Florida to plant a colony, but the Calusa drove the Spanish out, mortally wounding Ponce de León.

The Pánfilo de Narváez expedition of 1528 and the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1539 both landed in the vicinity of Tampa Bay, north of the Calusa domain. Dominican missionaries reached the Calusa domain in 1549, but withdrew because of the hostility of the tribe. Salvaged goods and survivors from wrecked Spanish ships reached the Calusa during the 1540s and 1550s. The best information about the Calusa comes from the &quot;Memoir&quot; of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, one of these survivors. Fontaneda was shipwrecked on the east coast of Florida, likely in the Florida Keys, about 1550, when he was thirteen years old. Although many others survived the shipwreck, only Fontaneda was spared by the tribe in whose territory they landed. Warriors killed all the adult men. Fontaneda lived with various tribes in southern Florida for the next 17 years before being found by the Menendez de Avilés expedition.

In 1566, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, founder of St. Augustine, made contact with the Calusa. He struck an uneasy peace with their leader Caluus, or Carlos. Menéndez married Carlos&#x27; sister, who took the baptismal name Doña Antonia at conversion. Menéndez left a garrison of soldiers and a Jesuit mission, &quot;San Antón de Carlos,&quot; at the Calusa capital. Hostilities erupted, and the Spanish soldiers killed Carlos, his successor Felipe, and several of the &quot;nobles&quot; before they abandoned their fort and mission in 1569.

For more than a century after the Avilés adventure, little contact happened between the Spanish and Calusa. Re-entering the area in 1614, Spanish forces attacked the Calusa as part of a war between the Calusa and Spanish-allied tribes around Tampa Bay. A Spanish expedition to ransom some captives held by the Calusa in 1680 was forced to turn back; neighboring tribes refused to guide the Spanish, for fear of retaliation by the Calusa. In 1697, Franciscan missionaries established a mission to the Calusa, but left after a few months.

After the outbreak of war between Spain and England in 1702, slaving raids by Uchise Creek and Yamasee Indians allied with the Province of Carolina began reaching far down the Florida peninsula. The Carolinan colonists supplied firearms to the Creek and Yemasee, but the Calusa, who had isolated themselves from Europeans, had none. Ravaged by new infectious diseases introduced to the Americas by European contact and by the slaving raids, the surviving Calusa retreated south and east.

In 1711, the Spanish helped evacuate 270 Indians, including many Calusa, from the Florida Keys to Cuba (where almost 200 soon died). They left 1,700 behind. The Spanish founded a mission on Biscayne Bay in 1743 to serve survivors from several tribes, including the Calusa, who had gathered there and in the Florida Keys. The mission was closed after only a few months.

After Spain ceded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1763, the remaining tribes of South Florida were relocated to Cuba by the Spanish, completing their removal from the region. While a few Calusa individuals may have stayed behind and been absorbed into the Seminole, no documentation supports that. Cuban fishing camps (&quot;ranchos&quot;) operated along the southwest Florida coast from the 18th century into the middle of the 19th century. Some of the Spanish Indians (often of mixed Spanish-Indian heritage) who worked at the fishing camps likely were descended from Calusa.
