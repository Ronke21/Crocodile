<text>Warren Anderson Mathis (born March 6, 1977), better known by his stage name Bubba Sparxxx, is an American rapper. His 2001 single, &quot;Ugly&quot; (featuring Timbaland) peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and led him to sign with Timbaland&#x27;s Beat Club Records, an imprint of Interscope Records to release his debut studio album, &quot;Dark Days, Bright Nights&quot; (2001). Met with critical and commercial success, it peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

His second album, &quot;Deliverance&quot; (2003) was met with further critical acclaim, while his third, &quot;The Charm&quot; (2006)—released by Big Boi&#x27;s Purple Ribbon Records, an imprint of Virgin Records—yielded the single &quot;Ms. New Booty&quot; (featuring Ying Yang Twins and Mr. Collipark), which peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This marked final release on a major label, and his subsequent releases delved further into country rap.

== Early life ==
Mathis grew up in Troup County, Georgia in a rural area near LaGrange, Georgia. He is of French descent. His father was a school bus driver and his mother was a grocery store cashier. His closest neighbor, who lived half a mile (0.8 km) away, introduced him to rap music through mixtapes mailed from New York City. The music of 2 Live Crew was his introduction to hip hop; he began listening to West Coast gangsta rap such as N.W.A and Too Short and the Atlanta duo Outkast. With rapping as a hobby, he was a tight end and linebacker for his high school&#x27;s football team and earned All-Region honors in his senior year. Steve Herndon, a former offensive lineman for the NFL&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos, played football with him during high school, according to an interview with &quot;Down-South.com&quot;. In 2007, he moved to Tampa, Florida.

== Career ==

In 1996, he moved to Athens, Georgia where he met industry veteran Bobby Stamps. Stamps noticed him rapping after a University of Georgia football game and later introduced him to Atlanta producer Shannon Houchins.
For two years, Houchins and Stamps worked together to produce Sparxxx&#x27;s first commercial release, &quot;Dark Days, Bright Nights&quot;, which released in 2001. The debut album saw some success in Georgia and caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records. Sparxxx signed to Interscope and began working with record producers Timbaland and Organized Noize, as well as continuing to work with Shannon Houchins. The major-label reissue of &quot;Dark Days, Bright Nights&quot;, released via Timbaland&#x27;s Beat Club Records imprint and which now included five collaborations with Timbaland and two with Organized Noise, debuted at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2002, he had a minor hit being featured on Archie Eversole&#x27;s &quot;We Ready&quot;, which became popular for being played at sporting events, such as American football and basketball games. In late 2003, he returned with his second album, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, which was critically acclaimed but sold poorly.

Sparxxx signed a recording contract with Virgin Records in 2004; under Virgin, Sparxxx released &quot;The Charm&quot; with singles &quot;Ms. New Booty&quot; and &quot;Heat It Up&quot;.
He left Virgin to establish his own label, New South Entertainment, which is distributed by E1 Records. In 2007, he released a mixtape with DJ Burn One titled &quot;Survive Till Ya Thrive&quot;.

In 2012, he signed to Backroad Records, a subsidiary of the independent label Average Joes Entertainment owned by Shannon Houchins and Colt Ford, and recorded the song &quot;Country Boy Coolin&#x27;&quot; which was featured on Mud Digger Vol. 3, a compilation album released by Average Joe&#x27;s on June 12, 2012. He stated in an interview that he planned on releasing an album to be called &quot;Miracle on Gamble Road&quot;, in 2012.

In January 2013, Sparxxx released the video &quot;Splinter&quot; which featured Crucifix. In July 2013, a video for his single &quot;Country Folks&quot;, which features Danny Boone of the band Rehab and Colt Ford and produced by Houchins, was released. The album &quot;Pain Management&quot; was released on October 15, 2013.

In March 2016, Sparxxx signed to Yelawolf&#x27;s Slumerican records imprint. On October 7, 2016, Sparxxx released his first release under Slumerican &quot;The Bubba Mathis EP&quot;. Sparxxx released &quot;Rapper From The Country&quot; on September 16, 2018, through New South Entertainment (E1).

On November 11, 2020, Sparxxx released an EP, &quot;Crickets&quot; with Hosier. On December 4, 2020, Sparxxx released his seventh album &quot;King of Crap&quot; through New South Entertainment which had the single &quot;Bird Dawg&quot;. In May 2021, WORLDSTARHIPHOP released a video for &quot;Bird Dawg&quot;.

<doc id="514960" wikidata="Q3888374" url="?curid=514960" title="Pablo Cruise">
<text>Pablo Cruise is an American pop/rock band from San Francisco currently composed of David Jenkins (guitar and vocals), Cory Lerios (keyboards and vocals), Sergio Gonzalez (drums), Larry Antonino (bass and vocals), and Robbie Wyckoff (vocals and percussion). Formed in 1973, the band released seven studio albums over the next decade, during which time five singles reached the top 25 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The group underwent several personnel changes and split up in 1986. The original lineup—Jenkins, Lerios, Price and Bud Cockrell—reunited briefly in 2004, and the group continues to tour today with two out of the original four members present.

==History==
Pablo Cruise began in San Francisco in 1973 with former members of Stoneground (Cory Lerios on keyboards and vocals, David Jenkins as vocalist and on guitar and Steve Price on drums) and It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day (Bud Cockrell on bass and vocals). Lerios had formed a band, Together, while at Palo Alto High School. His classmate, Steve Price, signed on as a roadie (because he owned a van) then joined the group on drums when their drummer left. They were eventually to find their way into Stoneground, where they were joined by Jenkins (originally from Ypsilanti, Michigan).

Initially, many fans assumed that Pablo Cruise was the name of one of the members of the band. When asked the question, the band, which is a quartet, would answer, &quot;He&#x27;s the guy in the middle.&quot; When asked what Pablo Cruise meant, the band would say that &quot;Pablo represents an honest, real, down-to-earth individual and Cruise depicts his fun-loving and easygoing attitude towards life.&quot; Casey Kasem claimed that the band&#x27;s name originated with a drifter.

With the help of their new manager, Bob Brown (who would later steer Huey Lewis and the News to stardom), the band signed to A&amp;M Records and released its first album in May 1975, a minor success self-titled &quot;Pablo Cruise&quot;, and their second album in March 1976, titled &quot;Lifeline&quot;. Their second album achieved slightly greater success than their first but still only managed to chart at No. 139 in the United States. The instrumental &quot;Zero to Sixty in Five&quot; from &quot;Lifeline&quot; was used as theme music for various sports television shows. That success encouraged the band to try their hand at more film and TV scoring.

1977&#x27;s &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; was the turning point in the band&#x27;s career as they finally entered the mainstream music scene with hit singles &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do?&quot; (No. 6) and the title track &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (No. 42), the album peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard 200.

==Further success and lineup changes==
In the middle of 1977, Bud Cockrell left to form a duo with his wife and former It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day bandmate Pattie Santos and was replaced by Bruce Day (who had played in a band with Carlos Santana before his Santana days).

Day&#x27;s first album with the band was the RIAA platinum-selling 1978 album &quot;Worlds Away&quot;, which spawned the hits &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Live Without It&quot;. It also featured a cover of Australian singer-songwriter Peter Allen&#x27;s hit single &quot;I Go to Rio&quot; and the follow-up album was 1979&#x27;s &quot;Part of the Game&quot; that spawned the hit &quot;I Want You Tonight&quot;. Also that year, Pablo Cruise contributed the song &quot;Reach For The Top&quot; to the movie &quot;Dreamer&quot; and the following year, they placed &quot;What&#x27;ve You Got To Lose&quot; with the film &quot;Inside Moves&quot;.

Day&#x27;s tenure was short-lived and after he left the band in 1980, he was replaced by the session bassist John Pierce who, alongside newly added second guitarist Angelo Rossi, debuted on the 1981 album &quot;Reflector&quot;, and it spawned the band&#x27;s last Top 40 hit &quot;Cool Love&quot;.

In mid-1981, Price left suddenly and was initially succeeded by Donny Baldwin, who had played with Elvin Bishop and would move on to Jefferson Starship by the summer of 1982. David Perper was next to take over the drum throne and Angelo Rossi was replaced by Stef Birnbaum (aka Stef Burns) after just one album.

In 1983 the group released &quot;Out of Our Hands&quot;, which featured a change of sound to a more &quot;&#x27;80s pop keyboard direction&quot; with Lerios bringing in more synthesizers and downplaying the piano, which had until then been a characteristic of the group&#x27;s sound and Price played drums on two songs. The band then toured again that year with another new member, Jorge Bermudez, on vocals and percussion. Mostly due to the rising popularity of new wave, the album struggled with sales. But by the end of 1984, Pierce, Birnbaum and Bermudez had left and the group&#x27;s contract with A&amp;M had come to an end.

==1985 attempted reunion and hiatus==
In 1985 the four original members, Jenkins, Lerios, Price and Cockrell, reunited hoping to score a new record deal. It was not to be, however, and the group called it quits in 1986.

Jenkins moved on to join country rockers Southern Pacific in 1987, alongside former Doobie Brothers members Keith Knudsen and John McFee and Creedence Clearwater Revival bass player Stu Cook. After leaving Southern Pacific in 1989, Jenkins relocated to Hawaii where he was introduced to Hawaiian artist Kapono Beamer and began writing music with him. This eventually led to their album &quot;Cruisin&#x27; On Hawaiian Time&quot; (2006), a collection of songs dedicated to the Hawaiian Islands.

In the meantime, Cory Lerios worked on movie and television scores, providing the music for the popular 1990s series &quot;Baywatch&quot;, among many others.

==1996 partial reunion==
Around 1996, Jenkins and Cockrell reunited once again as Pablo Cruise, but Lerios and Price were unable to rejoin at the time. Keyboardist Kincaid Miller and drummer Kevin Wells (ex-Clover) were brought in to replace them, and percussionist James Henry also appeared with the band as an occasional special guest from 1999 to 2008. Additionally, second guitarist Kenny Emerson (replacing Stef Burns, who had briefly returned to the band in 1998) and two additional backup singers, Regina Espinoza and Carolyn, were also recruited (from 1999 to 2002) for added stage attraction. Drummer Billy Johnson (ex-Santana) frequently sat in for Wells during this same time.

Former bassist Bruce Day died on June 30, 1999, in Windsor, California, from unknown causes at the age of 48.

==2004 to present==
In June 2004 all four original Pablo members were back together playing again at Steve Price&#x27;s wedding. This led to three of the four—Jenkins, Lerios and Price—deciding to reconvene permanently. Cockrell was not involved this time and George Gabriel joined on bass and vocals. During his time away from Pablo Cruise, Price went on to become a leading figure in providing E-learning and also formed his own aerial photography company. Gabriel left Pablo Cruise in November 2009 and was replaced by veteran bassist Larry Antonino (who has worked with Air Supply, Jeff Beck, Ronnie Laws and many others) in 2010.

Bud Cockrell died on March 6, 2010, after complications from diabetes. He was 59.

On November 8, 2011 Pablo Cruise released their first live album, &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be Live&quot;, on the Red Recording label. The package included both a live CD and DVD. The live performances were taken from concerts performed at the Blue Goose in Loomis, CA on July 9 and 10, 2010. The CD also featured new versions of their songs &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (featuring fellow Red Recording artist Katrina) and &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; (with Ty Taylor of Vintage Trouble).

In 2015 Cory Lerios released an EP, &quot;If I Could Change Anything It Would Be You!&quot;, under the name Cory Charles.

In 2017 the band was joined by singer/percussionist Robbie Wyckoff who had appeared with Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters on his The Wall Live tour.

In February 2020 the band finished the Rock and Romance Cruise, which turned out to be their final shows for 2020. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the band worked on a new single, &quot;Breathe&quot;, via Skype, with new drummer Sergio Gonzalez in place of Steve Price, who had retired from the group due to health issues.

The band resumed playing shows in the summer of 2021 and continues to tour, mainly in and around California.

<text>The Big Sandy River (also called Big Sandy Creek) is a tributary of the Green River in Wyoming in the United States.

==Course==
It rises in eastern Sublette County, on the west side of the continental divide in the southern Wind River Range, in the Bridger Wilderness Area of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.

It flows south, southwest, southeast, then southwest, past the town of Farson and joins the Green in western Sweetwater County.

Above Farson, it is dammed to form the Big Sandy Reservoir.

<text>Shikumen (, Shanghainese: &quot;zaq⁸ khu¹ men⁶,&quot; IPA: ) is a traditional Shanghainese architectural style combining Western and Chinese elements that first appeared in the 1860s.

The term 石库门 is derived from the Shanghainese dialect 石箍门, 箍 meaning &quot;to frame or encase.&quot; 石箍门 referred to the characteristically &quot;stone-framed door&quot; of the tenement houses. At the height of their popularity, there were 9,000 shikumen-style buildings in Shanghai, comprising 60% of the total housing stock of the city; however, the proportion is currently much lower, as most Shanghainese live in large apartment buildings. Shikumen is classified as one type of &quot;lilong&quot; residences, sometimes translated as &quot;lane houses&quot; in English.

In 2010, &quot;construction techniques of shikumen &quot;lilong&quot; architecture&quot; was recognised by the Chinese government on the national non-physical cultural heritage register (no. VIII-210).

Shikumen houses were also introduced to other port cities in China. For example, many were built in the foreign concessions of Hankou (now part of Wuhan), and some can still be seen there today. Shikumen terraces can even be found as far afield as Beijing, where the two shikumen lanes Huakang Li and Tai’an Li, dating from the 1920s, are undergoing restoration.

==Structure==
Shikumens are two or three-story structures resembling Western terrace houses or townhouses, distinguished by high brick walls enclosing a narrow front yard. The name &quot;stone gate&quot; references these strong gateways.

Each residence abuts another and all are arranged in straight side alleys called longtang (, Shanghainese: &quot;lon⁶ daon⁶&quot;, IPA: , sometimes written as 衖堂). The entrance to each alley is usually surmounted by a stylistic stone arch.

The shikumen is a cultural blend of the elements found in Western architecture with traditional Lower Yangtze architecture and social behavior. Traditional Chinese dwellings had a courtyard, and the Shikumen was no exception. Yet, to compromise with its urban nature, it was much smaller and provided an interior haven to the commotions in the streets, allowing for raindrops to fall and vegetation to grow freely within a residence. The courtyard also allowed sunlight and improved ventilation into the rooms.

==History==
===Origin===

This style of housing originally developed when local developers adapted Western-style terrace houses to Chinese conditions. Migrant labourers from surrounding provinces entered Shanghai in large numbers with the establishment of Shanghai as a treaty port in 1843. The 1853 Small Swords Rebellion and the Taiping Revolution drove more migrants and refugees into Shanghai. With the upsurge in demand, property developers began to build a large number of residential buildings for the new Chinese residents of the city. At first, these tended to be wooden buildings that were cheap and quick to build. These wooden buildings were built as terraces, and usually name with &quot;&quot;Li&quot; (, Shanghainese: &quot;li⁶&quot;) as suffix. These were the first &quot;lilong&quot;&quot; buildings in Shanghai. Within 10 months from 1853, 800 dwellings of this type were built.

Because of their flammability, this type of construction was banned by concession authorities in Shanghai. However, with a burgeoning property development market in Shanghai, developers adapted these wooden terraces into the Shikumen. They used the traditional Chinese &quot;litie&quot; technique of wooden frame and load-bearing brick veneer construction, and for each residence used the traditional three-sided courtyard or four-sided courtyard layouts commonly found in the Jiangnan region.


===Development===
Shikumen residences had a much smaller footprint than traditional courtyard residences, and were accessed by narrow lanes. They were also cheaper to build than Western-style houses. Although more expensive to build than the wooden terraces they replaced, they were sturdier and so attracted higher rents. They were first built in the British concession (later part of the International Settlement; and still later, the pre-merger Huangpu District), but quickly became popular throughout the Old City and Chinese zones, and came to become the predominant form of residential construction in Shanghai. The high profit attracted a whole swathe of property companies to enter the shikumen market.

From the 1910s, various innovations were made to the shikumen in response to social change. With a burgeoning middle class, designers increased the width of lanes between terraces, but the width of each dwelling decreased - from a three-bay hall and two side wings (as was standard in the 19th century) to a two-bay or one-bay hall, and one side wing. Decorations became more elaborate: the main doors of the houses acquired the characteristic elaborate lintels, featuring architraves, archivolts and pediments. By around 1919, increasing population pressures and an increasing wealth gap encouraged the development of smaller, but better equipped, &quot;new type&quot; shikumen. &quot;New type&quot; shikumen were three storeys tall instead of two, and were equipped with modern sanitary equipment. Great emphasis was placed on natural lighting, with most shikumen orientated towards the south, and an internal staircase skylight or atrium to supplement the front and back courtyards. Developments became larger, with a trunk lane leading off the street, and branch lanes leading off the trunk lane. Cars became more popular, so the trunk lanes were typically designed to accommodate cars.

===Later history===
The heyday of the &quot;new type&quot; shikumen was in the 1920s. From the 1930s they were replaced by newer building types, including newer types of &quot;lilong&quot; residences, as well as larger modern apartment buildings, before the civil war and the Second Sino-Japanese War completely disrupted the property market in Shanghai.

It was common for families who could not afford the rent on a whole house to sub-let some of the rooms. They were known as &quot;second landlords&quot; (, &quot;èr fángdōng&quot;) (as opposed to the head-landlord (, &quot;dà fángdōng&quot;)). &quot;Second landlords&quot; often lived in the same shikumen residence with their tenants. The phenomenon blossomed after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War: with refugees rushing into the unoccupied concessions from the Chinese zones in Hongkou and Zhabei, and further afield, there was dramatically increased demand for housing in the concessions. &quot;Second landlords&quot; used increasingly creative ways to sub-divide rooms and build add-ons and lean-tos in the courtyards and on the terraces. Shikumen residences became known for being crowded and disorderly. It was not uncommon for a single shikumen residence to be inhabited by dozens of families. A famous satirical comedy of the time, set in one of these houses, was called &quot;The 72 Tenant Families&quot; ().

===Use===
Although designed to be residential, other types of enterprises often operated from shikumen buildings as well, hidden within &quot;longtang&quot; developments. These include money lenders, traders, scribes, factories, entertainment venues and even schools. For example, one larger shikumen development, &quot;Xingren Li&quot;, featured more than 20 money lenders. Often, traders would use the ground floor rooms for storage, and live in the upper floors. Chemical and dye dealers were common. Even light industry was found within shikumen communities, such as sock factories and cosmetics factories. Even more common (and common even today in surviving and renovated shikumen lanes) are grocers, restaurants, inns and bath houses.

Densely populated shikumen neighbourhoods provided camouflage for revolutionaries. The Chinese Communist Party held its first conference in a shikumen residence in &quot;Shude Li&quot;, and its second conference in another shikumen residence in the French Concession. The Communist Youth League first operated out of a shikumen residence on Avenue Joffre.

Shikumen neighbourhoods were also often used for less salubrious trades. The lanes &quot;Huile Li&quot; and &quot;Qunyu Fang&quot;, on Foochow Road (now Fuzhou Road), formed the epicentre of Shanghai&#x27;s red light district before 1949. Gambling and opium dens commonly appeared in shikumen neighbourhoods, along with fortune tellers.

===Demise===
By the late 1930s, shikumen buildings were already on their way out, overtaken by newer styles of &quot;lilong&quot; residences, and large apartment buildings. Commercial property development in Shanghai virtually ceased during the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War that followed it. After the end of the war 1949, shikumen construction ceased completely, replaced with planned construction of residential buildings on collectivist principles. In the early 1950s, it was calculated that there were more than 9000 shikumen buildings, comprising 65% of residential housing stock by area in Shanghai. While constructions of new residential buildings decreased this percentage over time, most shikumen neighbourhoods remained unchanged in their crowded state until economic reforms in the 1980s and 90s began the wave of demolition and reconstruction which, by the early 21st century, has left only a few shikumen developments intact. In Xuhui District alone, it has been calculated that shikumen residences had decreased from 2.68 million square metres in 1949, to 0.25 million square metres by the late 1990s. The forced demolition of crowded and stable shikumen communities gave rise to controversies, such as a 2005 incident where a developer resorted to arson to persuade residents to leave, resulting in the death of two elderly residents.

==Classification and architecture==
Architectural historians classify shikumen into two types, the &quot;old type&quot; and the &quot;new type&quot;. The old type was predominantly built from the 1860s until the end of the First World War, while the new type prevailed from after the First World War until the development of shikumen ceased after 1949. Old type shikumen is further divided into an early period and a late period.

The defining characteristic of a shikumen building is the prominent main gate - which also gives rise to the name &quot;shikumen&quot;. Typically, this gate is located on the central axis of each dwelling, with twin doors made of heavy wood, painted glossy black. Typical width is around 1.4 metres, with a height of around 2.8 metres. The doors usually possess brass or iron knockers. The original documented name for such buildings was &quot;shigumen&quot; (, Shanghainese: &quot;zaq⁸ ku¹ men⁶&quot;), which in Shanghainese Wu meant &quot;gate framed with stone&quot;, but over time corrupted into the similar-sounding &quot;shikumen&quot;. Each individual dwelling displays typical characteristics of traditional Jiangnan architecture, while the layout of the development as a whole is adopted from Western terrace houses.

===Old type===

====Early period====

Early period old type shikumen were built between 1869 and 1910. They retained more of the style of traditional Chinese houses, but with a much condensed footprint. There are typically 3 to 5 bays to each dwelling, and two storeys. They used the traditional &quot;litie&quot; () (or &quot;brick nogging&quot;) style of brick veneer for load-bearing walls. The houses possessed walls of equal height at the front and back, so that each dwelling (despite being part of a terrace) was an enclosed whole, separated from the outside world. This made them popular with the upper end of the residential property market.

The early period shikumen also possessed more features of traditional Chinese architecture: on the external façade of the terrace there are often typically Chinese &quot;matou&quot; (&quot;horse head&quot;) style or &quot;Guanyin dou&quot; (&quot;Guanyin hood&quot;) style gables; the main hall uses floor-to-ceiling windows; decorative boards below eaves; and grid windows on the side wings. However, in contrast to later shikumen buildings, the gates of early period shikumen were not elaborately decorated, and were simply framed in stone. In terms of layout, the shikumen of this period were arranged in lanes of about 3 metres wide - narrower than later buildings - and the attention to orientation, and organization of trunk lanes and branch lanes, both features of later shikumen, were also absent.

In terms of internal lay-out, immediately within the main gate is the front courtyard (&quot;tianjing&quot; ), flanked by wings (&quot;xiangfang&quot; ) of the house on the left and right. At the centre, facing the courtyard is the hall, or &quot;ketang jian&quot; (). This large room typically has an area of about 12 square metres, and is used like a modern sitting room or living room. On either side of the hall are the &quot;cijian&quot; () or &quot;secondary rooms&quot;. Stairs to reach the first floor are located behind the &quot;cijian&quot;. Behind the hall and the &quot;cijian&quot; is the back courtyard (&quot;houtianjing&quot; ), which is about half the size of the front courtyard. The well, which provided water for the house, was located here (though later houses were connected to tap water instead). At the back of the back courtyard are back buildings, usually used as the kitchen, toilet and storage room. On the whole, each dwelling preserved the main features required for traditional Chinese day-to-day living, while saving the land required.

Most early period old style shikumen have been demolished or rebuilt. Representative examples include the &quot;Xingren Li&quot;, built in 1872 (demolished 1980), and &quot;Mianyang Li&quot; and &quot;Jixiang Li&quot;, both located near the &quot;Shiliupu&quot; dock area.

====Late period====

Late period shikumen were mostly built between 1910 and 1919. The three-bay wide frontage with two side wings was reduced to one- or two-bay wide, with one side wing. The back courtyard was reduced, but more attention was paid to natural lighting, and the laneways were widened. More Western architectural details found favour: bannisters, doors and windows, staircase, pillar capitals and arch buttresses all used Western decorative styles. The lintel of the main gate also became increasingly elaborate, decorated with semicircular archivolts, triangular pediments or rectangular architraves.

Late period old type shikumen are far better preserved than early period examples. Representative examples include the west and east &quot;Siwen Li&quot; (in the process of being demolished), north &quot;Shude Li&quot;, and &quot;Daqing Li&quot;, built in 1915. One of the few old type shikumen developments to be preserved largely intact is &quot;Bugao Li&quot;, or &quot;Cité Bourgogne&quot; (built in the 1930s), in the former French Concession.

===New type===
New type shikumen were typically built from 1919 to the 1930s. They were also called &quot;reformed style&quot; shikumen residences. The main structural difference between new type and old type shikumen is that new style buildings are three storeys high. They were built of reinforced concrete, rather than brick veneer. Some were equipped with modern sanitary equipment, and natural lighting became a key concern. Developments are typically laid out with a main, trunk lane, with houses arranged along branch lanes leading from the trunk lane. With the advent of motor cars, the trunk lanes were usually built wide enough to accommodate cars. Instead of one lane with one or two rows of houses, new style shikumen were typically developed in large blocks. Standard triangular gables and party walls replaced the more elaborate &quot;matou&quot; or &quot;Guanyin dou&quot; styles, with concrete tops. Exposed brick was used for external walls. The main gate frame also switched from stone to brick and painted stone cladding. The architectural style became far more Westernised overall.

Each dwelling was one to two bays wide. Two-bay wide houses &quot;inherited&quot; only one side wing, while one-bay wide houses discarded wings completely. Stairs became less steep. The new second floor typically contained bedrooms, along with a front and a back terrace (&quot;shaitai&quot;, ). The ground floor were equipped with kitchens (&quot;zaopi jian&quot; ). At the back of the house, a &quot;back wing&quot; was added, as well as the &quot;tingzi jian&quot; () or &quot;pergola room&quot;, located above the kitchen and below the terrace. This was typically small, with low ceilings, and faced north, making it the least attractive room in the house. They were usually used for storage, or as living quarters for servants.

Numerous new type shikumen have survived. Some well known examples include &quot;Jianye Li&quot; (now revamped into an upmarket hotel, commercial and residential complex), &quot;Siming Cun&quot;, and &quot;Mingde Li&quot; located on Avenue Joffre.

==Names==
In Chinese, shikumen developments are typically named with a suffix of &quot;Li&quot; (, &quot;neighbourhood&quot;), &quot;Fang&quot; (, &quot;ward&quot;), &quot;Long&quot; (, &quot;lane&quot;) or &quot;Cun&quot; (, &quot;village&quot;). The first two are traditional suffixes for names of urban precincts, in common use since at least the Tang dynasty. Where an English name was used, &quot;Terrace&quot; was a common suffix.

The first part of the name typically derives from one of three sources. The first kind takes the name of the freeholder or related party: for example &quot;Siming Cun&quot; is named after the Chinese name (&quot;Siming Bank&quot;) of the project&#x27;s main sponsor, the Ningpo Commercial &amp; Savings Bank; similarly, &quot;Meilan Fang&quot; takes one syllable from each of the two owners&#x27; names - brothers Wu &quot;Mei&quot;xi and Wu Si&quot;lan&quot;. The second kind takes the name of a nearby road or landmark, for example &quot;Bao&#x27;an Fang&quot; is named after the nearby Temple to the Bao&#x27;an Situ. The third type uses an auspicious words: such as &quot;Jixiang Li&quot; (&quot;auspicious&quot;), &quot;Ruyi Li&quot; (&quot;happiness&quot;) and &quot;Ping&#x27;an Li&quot; (&quot;safety&quot;). The Chinese name for &quot;Cité Bourgogne&quot;, &quot;Bugao Li&quot;, is both phonetically similar to the French name and has an auspicious meaning of &quot;stepping upwards&quot;.

The names are typically inscribed, along with the year of construction, on the arch above the lane entrance.

==Notable shikumen neighbourhoods today==

Few old type shikumen neighbourhoods survive. &quot;Xingren Li&quot;, built in 1872, was regarded as a characteristic old type shikumen development. It was located on East Beijing Road, and composed of 24 two-storey residences, which varied in size between three-bay wide and five-bay wide styles. The main lane was 107.5 metres long, and the end walls featured &quot;Guanyin dou&quot;-style gables. It was demolished in 1980.

Another notable now-demolished development was &quot;Siwen Li&quot;, located on Xinzha Road. This late period old type shikumen development occupied 4.66 hectares, with 48,000 square metres of floor space. There were a total of 706 residences of two or three storeys. Most of these buildings were one-bay wide, without modern sanitary equipment. The house gates were noted for intricate baroque style lintels. Originally a middle-class neighbourhood, the area became dense slums due to the influx of refugees in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The entire neighbourhood was razed progressively in 2012–2014.

&quot;Cité Bourgogne&quot; (&quot;Bugao Li&quot;), located on South Shanxi Road, is a typical old type shikumen development despite being built in the 1930s. The neighbourhood includes 87 two-storey brick veneer residences with a red brick exterior. The trunk lane is about 2.5 wide, and there are numerous branch lanes. The lanes are noted for their main gateways, modeled after traditional Chinese &quot;pailou&quot; gates. &quot;Cité Bourgogne&quot; is well preserved &quot;in situ&quot; as a municipal heritage site, and remains mostly residential.

The largest shikumen neighbourhood which survives in a mostly original state is &quot;Jianye Li&quot; (), also heritage protected. A new type development located on West Jianguo Road and Yueyang Road, the development is composed of 260 residences, all of which are two storey red brick buildings. This development is noted for its use of traditionally Chinese &quot;matou&quot; gables, and arched doorways. In 2003, the original residents were relocated, and the buildings were somewhat controversially renovated to become serviced apartments and to house restaurants and other commercial uses.

&quot;Shangxian Fang&quot; (), located on the site of the main hall of the International Institute of China of Gilbert Reid, is another heritage protected shikumen precinct, which is now being renovated to become &quot;shikumen hotels&quot;. Other re-developed shikumen precincts include Xintiandi, where the buildings were extensively reconstructed, and Tianzi Fang, which has been redeveloped for small businesses with an artistic bent, while largely preserving the fabric of the buildings. All of these redevelopment projects have been controversial.

Other than &quot;Cité Bourgogne&quot;, &quot;Shangxian Fang&quot; and &quot;Jianye Li&quot;, other heritage protected shikumen precincts are &quot;Siming Cun&quot;, &quot;Meilan Fang&quot; and &quot;Rongkang Li&quot;.

<text>The diplomonads (Greek for &quot;two units&quot;) are a group of flagellates, most of which are parasitic. They include &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot;, which causes giardiasis in humans. They are placed among the metamonads, and appear to be particularly close relatives of the retortamonads.

==Morphology==
Most diplomonads are double cells: they have two nuclei, each with four associated flagella, arranged symmetrically about the body&#x27;s main axis. Like the retortamonads, they lack both mitochondria and Golgi apparatuses. However, they are now known to possess modified mitochondria, in the case of &quot;G. duodenalis&quot;, called mitosomes. These are not used in ATP synthesis the way mitochondria are, but are involved in the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins.
==Possible sexual reproduction in &quot;Giardia&quot;==
The common intestinal parasite &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; (synonyms &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;, &quot;G. intestinalis&quot;) was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex. However, researchers found &quot;G. duodenalis&quot; to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes. These results suggested that &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; is capable of meiosis and thus sexual reproduction. Furthermore, Cooper et al. found direct evidence in &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; for infrequent meiotic recombination, indicative of sexual reproduction between individuals. Lasek-Nesselquist et al. also detected molecular signatures consistent with meiotic sex. The possibility of sexual reproduction is still debated.

&quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; contains two functionally equivalent nuclei that are inherited independently during mitosis. In the giardial cyst these nuclei fuse (karyogamy) and undergo homologous recombination facilitated by meiosis gene homologs. The recombination associated with karyogamy may primarily function to repair DNA damage.

&quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; is divided into eight assemblages based on host specificities and genetic divergence of marker genes. Although recombination can occur infrequently within assemblages, Xu et al. found that recombination between individuals from different assemblages is very rare. They suggested that the assemblages are genetically isolated lineages, and thus could be viewed as separated &quot;Giardia&quot; species.

<doc id="515000" wikidata="Q3889699" url="?curid=515000" title="Elliott Roosevelt (general)">
<text>Elliott Roosevelt (September 23, 1910 – October 27, 1990) was an American aviation official and wartime officer in the United States Army Air Forces, reaching the rank of brigadier general. He was a son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

As a reconnaissance commander, Roosevelt pioneered new techniques in night photography and meteorological data-gathering, but his claims to a distinguished record on combat missions have been largely discounted. After the war ended, he faced an investigation by the United States Congress on charges of corruption, including accusations that he had recommended the purchase of the experimental Hughes XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft ahead of a Lockheed model that was believed to be superior. Ultimately, he was found blameless. Roosevelt published a book about his attendance at several major Allied war conferences and a controversial exposé of his parents&#x27; private life. He also wrote 22 mystery novels. His career also embraced broadcasting, ranching, politics and business. He served as the 24th mayor of Miami Beach, Florida from 1965 to 1967.

==Early life==
Elliott Roosevelt was a son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882–1945) and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962). He was named after his maternal grandfather, Elliott Roosevelt (1860–1894). His siblings were Anna (1906–1975), James (1907–1991), Franklin Jr. (1914–1988), and John (1916–1981).

An older brother, Franklin, died in 1909 as an infant.

Roosevelt attended the Hun School of Princeton and went to Groton School, as did his brothers. He refused to attend Harvard College. Instead, he worked a series of briefly held jobs, beginning with advertising and settling in broadcasting in the 1930s, including a management position in the Hearst radio chain.

==Military service==
Roosevelt had always been interested in flight, and in 1933 he briefly served as general manager of Gilpin Airlines of Glendale, California, a small airline owned by Rep. Isabella Greenway (D-AZ), a close friend of the family. Later that year he became aviation editor for the William Randolph Hearst newspapers. After controversial involvement in the Air Mail Scandal and a secret attempt to sell bombers in civilian disguise to the USSR, he was hired as vice president of the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce (see Aerospace Industries Association), a post he held until 1935. That year, he moved to Fort Worth, Texas and became involved in broadcasting and farming.

Roosevelt received a captain&#x27;s commission in the United States Army Air Corps on 23 September 1940, his 30th birthday. His appointment in the middle of the 1940 election campaign caused a furious political row, although General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of the Air Corps, asserted that there was no pressure or nepotism involved. After brief service at Wright Field, Ohio, he took an intelligence course and served with the 21st Reconnaissance Squadron at the new U.S. facility in Gander, Newfoundland.

In the summer of 1941, Roosevelt searched for and located air base sites in Labrador, Baffin Island, and Greenland and reported on conditions in Iceland and along the rest of the embryonic North Atlantic ferry route. During this time, he coordinated closely with FDR, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and General Arnold. Elliott Roosevelt was the first to interest Churchill in American bases in Africa (including Bathurst in the Gambia), a step for which his father was not yet ready. He served as a procurement specialist, navigator, and intelligence and reconnaissance officer and rose to brigadier general by January 1945. Despite having poor eyesight and being classified 4-F (unfit), he also became a pilot and reportedly flew 89 combat missions by the time of his inactivation from the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in August 1945.

While Roosevelt operated from Gander in August 1941, FDR detached him and his brother Franklin Jr. to attend the Atlantic Conference (Atlantic Charter) in Argentia between Churchill and FDR, which was nearby. In January 1943, Roosevelt accompanied FDR as a military attaché to the Casablanca meeting and the subsequent Cairo and Tehran Conferences in November–December 1943. At a dinner during the Tehran Conference, Joseph Stalin proposed to round up and shoot some 50,000 German officers and technicians after the war in order to permanently incapacitate Germany. Roosevelt spoke in favor of the proposal which earned him Stalin&#x27;s cheers and the vocal and lasting hostility of Churchill who said &quot;I would rather be taken out into the garden here and now and be shot myself&quot;.

Following a navigator/bombardier course in the fall of 1941 and a brief stint on antisubmarine patrol duty with the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron at Muroc AAB, Roosevelt received a top-secret assignment to carry out clandestine reconnaissance flights over the Sahara Desert, with emphasis on French West Africa, with which the United States was not at war. Having been successful with this (Project Rusty), he was given command of the new 3d Reconnaissance Group at Colorado Springs. From Gibraltar and then Oran, Algeria, he led this unit in Operation Torch, the invasion of Northwest Africa in early November 1942. Roosevelt (with a pilot) flew the first U.S. reconnaissance missions over the theater in a borrowed RAF de Havilland Mosquito. This led to a long campaign for the U.S. adoption of this British aircraft, as Roosevelt held the American counterparts (modified Boeing B-17Cs and early Lockheed P-38s) to be inadequate and unlikely to survive in contested airspace.

From Maison Blanche, Algeria, and after the fall of Tunis, La Marsa near ancient Carthage, Roosevelt pioneered new tactics, including night aerial photography and obtained before and after imagery of Rome during that city&#x27;s first heavy bombing on 19 July 1943.

After his detachment to investigate reconnaissance issues in the United States (see the Hughes scandal section below), Roosevelt received command of the 8th Air Force&#x27;s reconnaissance wing in England: the 8th Provisional RW, later renamed the 325th Reconnaissance Wing. During this period, Roosevelt worked on the shuttle-bombing project with the USSR, and participated in the May 1944 mission to the USSR which inspected the new American bases at Poltava, Mirgorod, and Piryatin. His units also supported the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the bombing campaign against V-weapon sites.

Following threats of resignation and pressure from &quot;very high topside,&quot; in January 1945 General Arnold ordered General Carl Spaatz in England to appoint Roosevelt a rated pilot, and the president submitted his son&#x27;s name to the Senate for promotion to brigadier general. By standard rules, Roosevelt was eligible for the rank, but not for the pilot&#x27;s wings. Roosevelt continued in that rank in Europe until his father&#x27;s death on April 12, 1945. After VE-Day, the Air Forces could no longer find a &quot;suitable vacancy&quot; for him, and he was on leave and had staff duties in the United States. By coincidence, his last day of service was VJ-Day.

Roosevelt commanded the following units:

* 3d Reconnaissance Group, 11 July – 13 August 1942 at the rank of major; 30 September 1942 – 1 March 1943 ending at the rank of colonel
*: Assigned to Twelfth Air Force and flew aboard numerous aircraft types during reconnaissance missions for the North Africa campaign in Algeria and Tunisia
* Northwest African Photographic Reconnaissance Wing, February 1943 – November 1943, as lieutenant colonel and colonel. This was a composite unit with U.S., British, South African, and French squadrons.
* 90th Photographic Wing, 22 November 1943 – 25 January 1944 at the rank of colonel.
*: Assigned to Twelfth Air Force, command and control organization that provided photographic reconnaissance to both the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces. Operationally controlled both 3d and 5th Reconnaissance Groups in Tunisia. The 90th&#x27;s subordinate units reconnoitered airdromes, roads, marshaling yards, and harbors in Italy after the Allied landings at Salerno.
* 325th Photographic Wing, 9 August 1944 – 17 January 1945 at the rank of colonel; 22 January – 13 April 1945 ending at the rank of brigadier general.
*: Assigned to Eighth Air Force, command and control organization that through subordinate units, flew reconnaissance over the waters adjacent to the British Isles and the European continent to obtain meteorological data. Wing aircraft collected weather information needed in planning operations; flew night photographic missions to detect enemy activity; and provided daylight photographic and mapping missions. The wing also flew photographic missions over the Netherlands in support of Operation Market Garden in September 1944 and operated closely with tactical units in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944 – February 1945).

Roosevelt stated that he flew 89 combat missions and 470 combat hours prior to being called back for his father&#x27;s funeral in April 1945 (he did not return to active theaters). His decorations included the Distinguished Flying Cross. He also received the Order of the British Empire, the Croix de Guerre and Legion d&#x27;Honneur, the Moroccan Order of Ouissam Alaouite, and the U.S. Legion of Merit. He ended the war holding the Air Medal with reportedly eleven clusters. As a chase pilot for the Operation Aphrodite flights in 1944, Roosevelt said he witnessed the death of Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. over Blythburgh, England (there is no evidence in Aphrodite files that Roosevelt participated in this project, nor did he fly as chase pilot and witness the death of Joseph P. Kennedy).

After the war, Roosevelt no longer played a significant role in aviation, although he maintained a private pilot&#x27;s license and owned a small aircraft. He briefly served as the president of short-lived Empire Airlines of New York (1946), citing his influence with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which, however, did not result in route awards. Reported attempts to assist Howard Hughes&#x27;s TWA in obtaining air routes to the USSR also did not succeed.

===Warplanes purchasing scandal===
In August 1943, Colonel Roosevelt was asked by the Chief of the Army Air Forces, General Henry H. Arnold, to investigate several reconnaissance aircraft under development to select a successor to the Lockheed P-38 Lightning (F-4 and F-5 in the recon version), but the reason for Arnold&#x27;s choice of Roosevelt was not made public. Roosevelt assembled a group of five air officers, including veteran RAF reconnaissance pilot Wing Commander D.W. Steventon. Upon their arrival in Los Angeles, Roosevelt and his group were met by eight limousines arranged by John W. Meyer, a publicist and former nightclub owner who was employed by Hughes Aircraft Company. On his first day in town, Roosevelt was taken by Meyer to the Hollywood film studio of Warner Bros. and introduced to Faye Emerson, an actress with whom Roosevelt was linked romantically (the two would eventually marry). Over the next three days, Roosevelt and his group were seen with Meyer in Hollywood nightclubs and at parties in luxurious mansions in the company of aspiring actresses paid $100–400 per night by Meyer, the higher figure equivalent to $ in current value.

On August 11, Howard Hughes showed the group his Culver City aircraft factory, then personally flew them to see the private-venture Hughes D-2, an experimental twin-engine wooden aircraft then being test-flown at a Hughes facility at Harper Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert. The aircraft had already been turned down ten months earlier by Chief of Army Air Forces Material Division Oliver P. Echols, for being inadequate for military service; it was considered unlikely to become successful for numerous reasons, wooden construction and Hughes&#x27;s limited facilities among them. Roosevelt and his committee, however, fervently recommended the D-2. When Roosevelt returned to the East Coast of the United States, Meyer hosted another round of parties and nightclub outings in Manhattan and arranged for Faye Emerson to accompany Roosevelt. Among many favors, Meyer gave Emerson $132 worth of nylon stockings, a rare treat during wartime rationing.

On August 20, Roosevelt sent a report to General Arnold recommending immediate purchase of the D-2. On September 1, Arnold ordered Echols to contract with Hughes for an all-metal reconnaissance aircraft &quot;against my better judgment and the advice of my staff.&quot; During these two weeks, Arnold, Elliott Roosevelt, and FDR conferred frequently at the White House, and it is documented that Elliott Roosevelt complained to his father about Arnold&#x27;s reluctance to order the F-11.

Major General Charles E. Bradshaw wrote to Arnold to suggest that the Lockheed Lockheed XP-58 Chain Lightning was much farther along in development and could outperform the D-2 in every important aspect, but was unsuccessful in halting the Hughes contract. Implicating Roosevelt and United States Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. Jones, Assistant Secretary of War Robert A. Lovett noted to Major General Bennett E. Meyers that &quot;Hughes has got powerful friends here in Washington&quot; and that, if the background of the contract were uncovered, &quot;there&#x27;s going to be an awful smell.&quot; Nonetheless, Hughes was given $43 million (worth $ in dollars) to build 100 all-metal aircraft to be designated the Hughes XF-11.

In 1947, Roosevelt telephoned Hughes to warn him that a United States Senate subcommittee (the &quot;Brewster Committee&quot;, formerly the &quot;Truman Committee&quot;) intended to call them both to account for financial irregularities regarding the XF-11 as well as for Hughes&#x27; H-4 Hercules, popularly known as the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;. As part of the ongoing &quot;Investigation of the National Defense Program&quot;, on August 4, 1947, the subcommittee called Roosevelt and Meyer to testify about the Hollywood and Manhattan parties and women that Meyer had arranged and paid for. Meyer&#x27;s extensive financial records during such parties showed him paying $200 for &quot;presents for four girls&quot; and $50 for &quot;girls at the hotel (late)&quot;. At one point, Roosevelt asked Meyer: &quot;Any of those girls who were paid, were they procured for my entertainment?&quot; Meyer responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t like the word &#x27;procured,&#x27; because a girl who attends a party and is given a present is not necessarily &#x27;procured&#x27;.&quot; The committee found that Meyer had spent at least $1,000 in picking up Roosevelt&#x27;s hotel bills as well as his nightclub and party checks, and Faye Emerson&#x27;s bets at Agua Caliente Racetrack, and that Meyer had arranged for weekends in Palm Springs, California and Washington, D.C. for Roosevelt and Emerson, who eventually married in December 1944 after Roosevelt divorced his second wife in March 1944. The wedding at the Grand Canyon was also paid for by Meyer.

All told, Meyer reported to the committee that he had spent $5,083.79 ($ in dollars) on entertainment for Roosevelt. In his own defense, Roosevelt testified that he never heard of the XF-11 until General Arnold let him know about it, and that several of the parties appeared to have taken place on days when he was out of the country on active duty. Roosevelt said: &quot;If it is true that for the price of entertainment I made recommendations which would have in any way endangered the lives of the men under me...that fact should be made known to the public.&quot;

==Later life==
After FDR&#x27;s death in 1945, Roosevelt and his family moved to Top Cottage to be near his mother, who considered him her favorite child. She gave him financial assistance throughout her life. In 1947, Eleanor bought from the FDR estate Val-Kill farms, the home she lived in after FDR&#x27;s death, and deeded the property to Elliott Roosevelt. After he moved to Miami Beach and Havana with his fourth wife in 1952, his brother John bought the Hyde Park tract. Later, the property became the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site.

Roosevelt pursued many different careers during his life, including owning a pre-war radio station network (Texas State Network) in Texas and living as a rancher. He again moved to Florida and was elected mayor of Miami Beach in 1965, then was unseated two years later. After a business career marked by ties to organized crime, he was investigated by the Senate&#x27;s &quot;Jackson Committee&quot; in 1973.

In 1973 during the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings on corruption, Roosevelt was accused of involvement in an assassination plot on the Bahamanian prime minister. In 1968, he and an &quot;alleged mobster front man,&quot; Michael J. McLaney, offered Louis Mastriana (equivalent to $ in ) to assassinate Prime Minister Lynden Pindling. Mastriana was paid (equivalent to $ in ) up front, most of which came from Elliott Roosevelt (as proved by a signature on a check for the money). The assassination plot was conceived after Prime Minister Pindling&#x27;s failure to issue a gambling license to an associate of Meyer Lansky, (whom Michael J. McLaney worked for until his conviction in 1971). It was uncovered by Mastriana; he taped all of his conversation with Elliott Roosevelt, allegedly using equipment from the U.S. Postal Service. Roosevelt maintained that this was a lie until his death.

Roosevelt emigrated to Portugal in 1972, but left for England after Portuguese Carnation Revolution in 1974. He moved back to the United States, living in Bellevue, Washington; Indian Wells, California; and Scottsdale, Arizona. As Roosevelt approached his eightieth year, his final ambition was to &quot;outlive James.&quot; However, Roosevelt died at age 80 of heart and liver failure. Brother James died 10 months later in August 1991.

==Author and biographer==
Elliott authored numerous books, including a mystery series in which his mother, Eleanor Roosevelt, is the detective, as Murder and the First Lady (1984). 
Roosevelt described his experiences with his father during five important war conferences in his best-selling book &quot;As He Saw It&quot;. He also edited &quot;FDR: His Personal Letters&quot;, published after the war in four volumes. With James Brough, Roosevelt wrote a highly personal book about his parents called &quot;The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story&quot;, in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father&#x27;s relationships with mistress Lucy Mercer and secretary Marguerite (&quot;Missy&quot;) LeHand as well as graphic details surrounding the 1921 paralytic illness that crippled his father. Published in 1973, the biography also contains valuable insights into FDR&#x27;s run for vice-president, his rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly with the help of Louis McHenry Howe. A sequel to &quot;An Untold Story&quot; with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled &quot;A Rendezvous With Destiny&quot;, carried the Roosevelt saga to the end of World War II. &quot;Mother R.: Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s Untold Story&quot;, also with Brough, was published in 1977; &quot;The Conservators&quot;, a political book, in 1982. &quot;Eleanor Roosevelt, with Love: A Centenary Remembrance&quot;, came out in 1984.

==Marriages and children==
Roosevelt was married five times:

* On January 16, 1932, he married Elizabeth Browning Donner (1911–1980), daughter of William Henry Donner. They had one son, William Donner Roosevelt (1932–2003), an investment banker and philanthropist. On July 17, 1933, Donner filed a cross petition charging Roosevelt with &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; to a court at Minden, Nevada, and they were divorced.
* On July 22, 1933, in Burlington, Iowa, he married Ruth Josephine Googins (1908–1974). They had three children: Ruth Chandler Roosevelt (1934–2018), Elliott Roosevelt, Jr. (b. 1936), a Texas oilman, and David Boynton Roosevelt (1942–2022). Roosevelt and Googins were divorced in March 1944. She married Harry T. Eidson on June 23, 1944.
* On December 3, 1944, at the Grand Canyon in Arizona, he married actress Faye Emerson. They were divorced on January 17, 1950. She died of stomach cancer in 1983 in Spain.
* On March 15, 1951, in Miami Beach, Florida, he married Minnewa Bell (Gray Burnside Ross). They were divorced in 1960. Minnewa died in 1983.
* On November 3, 1960, in Qualicum Beach, British Columbia, he married Patricia Peabody Whitehead. Her four children, James M. Whitehead, Ford Whitehead, Gretchen Whitehead, and David Macauley Whitehead, were all adopted by Roosevelt. The couple&#x27;s only child together, Livingston Delano Roosevelt, died in 1962 as an infant.

<text>Thomas (Tom) Cavalier-Smith, FRS, FRSC, NERC Professorial Fellow (21 October 1942 – 19 March 2021), was a professor of evolutionary biology in the Department of Zoology, at the University of Oxford.

His research has led to discovery of a number of unicellular organisms (protists) and advocated for a variety of major taxonomic groups, such as the Chromista, Chromalveolata, Opisthokonta, Rhizaria, and Excavata. He was known for his systems of classification of all organisms.

==Life and career==
Cavalier-Smith was born on 21 October 1942 in London. His parents were Mary Maude (née Bratt) and Alan Hailes Spencer Cavalier Smith.

He was educated at Norwich School, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (MA) in Biology and King&#x27;s College London (PhD) in Zoology. He was under the supervision of Sir John Randall for his PhD thesis between 1964 and 1967; his thesis was entitled &quot;&quot;Organelle Development in&quot; Chlamydomonas reinhardii&quot;.

From 1967 to 1969, Cavalier-Smith was a guest investigator at Rockefeller University. He became Lecturer of biophysics at King&#x27;s College London in 1969. He was promoted to Reader in 1982.
From the early 1980s, Smith promoted views about the taxonomic relationships among living organisms. He was prolific, drawing on a near-unparalleled wealth of information to suggest novel relationships.
In 1989 he was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of British Columbia.
In 1999, he joined the University of Oxford, becoming Professor of evolutionary biology in 2000.

Thomas Cavalier-Smith died in March 2021 following the development of cancer.

===Taxonomy===
Cavalier-Smith was a prolific taxonomist, drawing on a near-unparalleled wealth of information to suggest novel relationships. His suggestions were translated into taxonomic concepts and classifications with which he associated new names, or in some cases, reused old names.
Cavalier-Smith did not follow or espouse an explicit taxonomic philosophy but his approach was closest to evolutionary taxonomy. He and several other colleagues were opposed to cladistic approaches to taxonomy arguing that the goals of cladification and classification were different; his approach was similar to that of many others&#x27; broad-based treatments of protists.

The scope of Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s taxonomic propositions was grand, but the numbers and composition of the components (taxa), and, often, their relations were not stable. Propositions were often ambiguous and short-lived; he frequently amended taxa without any change in the name. His approach was not universally accepted: Others attempted to underpin taxonomy of protists with a nested series of atomised, falsifiable propositions, following the philosophy of transformed cladistics. However, this approach is no longer considered defensible.

Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s ideas that led to the taxonomic structures were usually first presented in the form of tables and complex, annotated diagrams. When presented at scientific meetings, they were sometimes too rich, and often written too small, for the ideas to be easily grasped. Some such diagrams made their way into publications, where careful scrutiny was possible, and where the conjectural nature of some assertions was evident. The richness of his ideas, their continuing evolution, and the transition into taxonomies that gave Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s investigations into evolutionary paths (phylogeny) and the resulting classifications, its distinctive character.

==Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s narrative style==
Cavalier-Smith was courageous in his adherence to the earlier traditionalist style characterized by Charles Darwin, that of relying on narratives. One example was his advocacy for the Chromista that united lineages that had plastids with chlorophylls a and c (primarily chrysophytes and other stramenopiles, cryptophytes, and haptophytes) despite clear evidence that the group corresponded to a clade.

It was Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s claim that there was a single endosymbiotic event by which chlorophyll a and c containing plastids were acquired by a common ancestor of all three groups, and that the differences (such as cytological components and their arrangements) among the groups were the result of subsequent evolutionary changes. This interpretation that chromists were monophyletic also required that the heterotrophic (protozoan) members of all three groups had arisen from ancestors with plastids.

The alternative hypothesis was that the three chromophytic lineages were not closely related (to the exclusion of other lineages) (i.e. were polyphyletic), likely that all were ancestrally without plastids, and that separate symbiotic events established the chlorophyll a/c plastids stramenopiles, cryptomonads and haptophytes. The polyphyly of the chromists has been re-asserted in subsequent studies.

Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s lack of an objective and reproducible methodology that translated evolutionary insights into taxa and hierarchical schemes, was often confusing to those who did not follow his publications closely. Many of his taxa required his frequent adjustment (as illustrated below). In turn this led to confusion as to the scope of taxa that a taxonomic name was applied to.

Cavalier-Smith also reused familiar names (such as Protozoa) for innovative taxonomic concepts. This created confusion because Protozoa was and still is used in its old sense, alongside its use in the newer senses. Because of Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s tendency to publish rapidly and frequently change his narratives and taxonomic summaries, his approach and claims were frequently debated.

Palaeos.com described his writing style as follows: 
Prof. Cavalier-Smith of Oxford University has produced a large body of work which is well regarded. Still, he is controversial in a way that is a bit difficult to describe. The issue may be one of writing style. Cavalier-Smith has a tendency to make pronouncements where others would use declarative sentences, to use declarative sentences where others would express an opinion, and to express opinions where angels would fear to tread. In addition, he can sound arrogant, reactionary, and even perverse. On the other [hand], he has a long history of being right when everyone else was wrong. To our way of thinking, all of this is overshadowed by one incomparable virtue: the fact that he &quot;will&quot; grapple with the details. This makes for very long, very complex papers and causes all manner of dark murmuring, tearing of hair, and gnashing of teeth among those tasked with trying to explain his views of early life. See, [for example], Zrzavý (2001) [and] Patterson (1999). Nevertheless, he deals with all of the relevant facts.

==Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s contributions==


Cavalier-Smith wrote extensively on the taxonomy and classification of all life forms, but especially protists. One of his major contributions to biology was his proposal of a new kingdom of life: the Chromista, even though it is not widely accepted to be monophyletic (see above).

He also introduced new taxonomic groupings group for eukaryotes such as the Chromalveolata (1981), Opisthokonta (1987), Rhizaria (2002), and Excavata (2002). Though well known, many of his claims have been controversial and have not gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community. His taxonomic revisions often influenced the overall classification of all life forms.

===Eight kingdoms model===
Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s first major classification system was the division of all organisms into eight kingdoms. In 1981, he proposed that by completely revising Robert Whittaker&#x27;s Five Kingdom system, there could be eight kingdoms: Bacteria, Eufungi, Ciliofungi, Animalia, Biliphyta, Viridiplantae, Cryptophyta, and Euglenozoa.

In 1983, he revised his system particularly in the light of growing evidence that Archaebacteria were a separate group from Bacteria, to include an array of lineages that had been excluded from his 1981 treatment, to deal with issues of polyphyly, and to promote new ideas of relationships. In addition, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered. As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were given special status as a protozan subkingdom Archezoa, that he later elevated to kingdom status. This was later referred to as the Archezoa hypothesis. In 1993, the eight kingdoms became: Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Archezoa, Protozoa, Chromista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia.

The kingdom Archezoa went through many compositional changes due to evidence of polyphyly and paraphyly before being abandoned. He assigned some former members of the kingdom Archezoa to the phylum Amoebozoa.

===Six kingdoms models===
By 1998, Cavalier-Smith had reduced the total number of kingdoms from eight to six: Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae (including Glaucophyte, red and green algae), Chromista, and Bacteria. Nevertheless, he had already presented this simplified scheme for the first time on his 1981 paper and endorsed it in 1983.
Five of Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s kingdoms are classified as eukaryotes as shown in the following scheme: 
*&quot;Eubacteria&quot;
*Neomura
**&quot;Archaebacteria&quot;
**Eukaryotes
***Kingdom Protozoa
*** Unikonts (heterotrophs)
****Kingdom Animalia
****Kingdom Fungi
*** Bikonts (primarily photosynthetic)
****Kingdom Plantae (including red and green algae)
****Kingdom Chromista

The kingdom Animalia was divided into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa, and Bilateria (all other animal phyla).

He created three new animal phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, and gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids), and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tardigrades)
and recognised a total of 23 animal phyla.

Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s 2003 classification scheme:
* Unikonts
** protozoan phylum Amoebozoa (ancestrally uniciliate)
** opisthokonts
*** uniciliate protozoan phylum Choanozoa
*** kingdom Fungi
*** kingdom Animalia
* Bikonts
** protozoan infrakingdom Rhizaria
*** phylum Cercozoa
*** phylum Retaria (Radiozoa and Foraminifera)
** protozoan infrakingdom Excavata
*** phylum Loukozoa
*** phylum Metamonada
*** phylum Euglenozoa
*** phylum Percolozoa
** protozoan phylum Apusozoa (Thecomonadea and Diphylleida)
** the chromalveolate clade
*** kingdom Chromista (Cryptista, Heterokonta, and Haptophyta)
*** protozoan infrakingdom Alveolata
**** phylum Ciliophora
**** phylum Miozoa (Protalveolata, Dinozoa, and Apicomplexa)
** kingdom Plantae (Viridaeplantae, Rhodophyta and Glaucophyta)

===Seven kingdoms model===
Cavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised the classification in 2015, and published it in &quot;PLOS ONE&quot;. In this scheme they reintroduced the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms, Bacteria (previously &#x27;Eubacteria&#x27;) and Archaea (previously &#x27;Archebacteria&#x27;). This is based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) and the Catalogue of Life.

===Proposed root of the tree of life ===
In 2006, Cavalier-Smith proposed that the last universal common ancestor to all life was a non-flagellate Gram-negative bacterium (&quot;negibacterium&quot;) with two membranes (also known as diderm bacterium).

==Awards and honours==
Cavalier-Smith was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (FLS) in 1980, the Institute of Biology (FIBiol) in 1983, the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in 1987, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in 1988, the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in 1997, and the Royal Society of London (FRS) in 1998.

He received the International Prize for Biology from the Emperor of Japan in 2004, and the Linnean Medal for Zoology in 2007. He was appointed Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) between 1998 and 2007, and Advisor of the Integrated Microbial Biodiversity of CIFAR. He won the 2007 Frink Medal of the Zoological Society of London.

<doc id="515019" wikidata="Q2393839" url="?curid=515019" title="Japanese military aircraft designation systems">
<text>The Japanese military aircraft designation systems for the Imperial period (pre-1945) had multiple designation systems for each armed service. This led to the Allies&#x27; use of code names during World War II, and these code names are still better known in English-language texts than the real Japanese names for the aircraft. A number of different schemes were simultaneously in use.

==Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service==

The used several different aircraft designation systems simultaneously. Between 1931 and 1945, aircraft had &quot;Shi&quot; numbers designating the specification they were designed to. They also had a long form of Type and Model Number system used between 1920 and 1943, a short designation system akin to that of the United States Navy in use between the late 1920s and 1945, a system of popular names introduced to replace type numbers from 1943 through 1945.

===Specification &quot;Shi&quot; numbers===

Japanese Navy specifications from 1931 were given an experimental, or &quot;Shi&quot; (試) number, based on the year of the Emperor&#x27;s reign the specification was issued in. Since multiple specifications could be issued in a year, the number was disambiguated with the aircraft purpose.

During the period this designation system was in use, the Emperor in question was Hirohito, the &quot;Showa Emperor&quot;, thus the years of &quot;Showa&quot; were those used, which began in 1926.

Thus, the Mitsubishi Zero was designed to meet the 1937 specification called &quot;12-shi carrier fighter&quot;.

===Long Type and Model Number system===

After 1929, aircraft types were given a type number based on the last two digits of the Japanese imperial year (which is counted from the mythical founding of Japan in 660BC by Emperor Jimmu). Added to this was a brief description of the aircraft&#x27;s function. The Mitsubishi Zero was so-called because entered service in 1940 which was the Japanese year 2600, thus it was designated &quot;Type 0 Carrier Fighter&quot;.

Model numbers were added to show subtypes. By the late 1930s these were two digits, the first being airframe revisions, the second engine revisions.

The system was abandoned in 1943, when it was decided that it gave away too much information about the aircraft.

===Short system===
In the late 1920s a short designation scheme was adopted, which was similar to the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system. This scheme used a letter or two letters to designate a type of aircraft, a number to indicate the Navy Design Request Number in that type of aircraft, and finally a letter to designate the manufacturer. Unlike the US Navy system, the Japanese system did not have a different number series for each manufacturer, and did not omit the number &quot;1&quot;.

Thus, the Zero&#x27;s type in this designation system was A6M, which meant the sixth type of carrier fighter under this designation system, and that it was built by Mitsubishi.

Variants were indicated by an additional number at the end; repurposing an aircraft was indicated by a dash and then the new type letter.

Sometimes two aircraft were ordered from different manufacturers to the same specification at the same time, generally as insurance against the primary design not working out. In this case, the same series number was used for both.
&quot;Data from:&quot;Japanese Military Aircraft Designations
===Official names===

After July 1943, names were given to Navy aircraft instead of type designations. These names were given according to a scheme based on the aircraft&#x27;s role. These were official names, in contrast to Army aircraft whose names were popular nicknames.

* Fighters: Weather and meteorological names
** Carrier fighters and seaplane fighters: Wind names usually ending with &quot;pu&quot; or &quot;fu&quot; (風)
** Interceptors: Lightning names ending in &quot;den&quot; (電)
** Night fighters: Light names ending in &quot;ko&quot; (光)
* Attack planes: Mountains names ending in &quot;zan&quot; (山)
* Bombers: Star or constellation names usually ending in &quot;sei&quot; (星)
* Patrol: Sea or ocean names ending in &quot;kai&quot; (海) or &quot;yo&quot; (洋)
* Reconnaissance: Cloud names ending in &quot;un&quot; (雲)
* Trainers: Trees, plants and flowers
* Transports: Sky names ending in &quot;ku&quot; (空)
* Miscellaneous: Landscape names
* Purpose-built kamikaze aircraft: Flower names ending in &quot;ka&quot; (花)

Special cases include aircraft that employed non-conventional (i.e. non-propeller-driven) propulsion scheme like rocket-powered interceptor Shūsui (poetic term meaning &quot;Sharp Sword&quot;) and aircraft used for non-conventional deployments such as Special Attacker Seiran (&quot;Mountain Haze&quot;; deployed from submarines to strike targets behind the frontline and expected to be ditched upon returning to motherships).

==Imperial Japanese Army Air Service==

The (IJAAS) used a straightforward system based on year of service and type, nearly identical to the Navy&#x27;s long type and model number system. This system was used from 1927, replacing an earlier system in which a manufacturer type code from a Japanese Kanji ordinal from the Heavenly stems was assigned to the aircraft from each company, as well as a type number. With additional types being added, this system quickly became cumbersome. Assigned letters included 甲 (Ko) for Nieuport, 乙 (Otsu) for Salmson, 丙 (Hei) for SPAD, 丁 (Tei) for Farman, 戊 (Bo) for Caudron, and 己 (Ki) for Hanriot.
The &quot;Ki&quot; (キ; abbreviation of &quot;kitai&quot; = airframe) designation was also used and became prominent in later years.

===Long Type and Model Number system===
The first part of the designation was a two-digit type number based on the Japanese year in which the aircraft entered service. A minor exception was the year 1940 (2600), for which the type number 100 rather than zero was used. This was followed by a description of the aircraft&#x27;s function. If there were two or more aircraft with the same type and function, the latter was enhanced to further differentiate them. An example is the Type 2 single-seat fighter (the Nakajima Ki-44) and the Type 2 two-seat fighter (Kawasaki Ki-45).

Major modifications (such as a different engine) were indicated with a subtype number, officially in kanji but often in Roman numerals. Small-scale modifications (such as armament) are indicated with a Japanese Kanji ordinal from the Heavenly stems:- ko (甲), otsu (乙), hei (丙), tei (丁), bo (戊), ki (己), which equate to:- a (first), b (second), c (third), d (fourth), e (fifth), but are NOT direct translations. The character &quot;kai&quot;(改) was used if the modifications were large but not enough for a new type number.

===Short designation (&quot;Ki&quot; number)===

The &quot;Ki&quot; airframe designation indicates the project number (written in Arabic numerals), and was assigned in sequence to all projects regardless of manufacturer or type.

===Popular names===
Popular names such as &quot;Hayabusa&quot; (the Nakajima Ki-43) were not part of the official designation.

==Calendars and Type numbers==
&quot;Data from:&quot; 

Type numbers were assigned by both the Army and Navy followed the Taisho number sequence, the number of years the Emperor Taisho had been on the throne until Emperor Showa replaced him on 25 December 1926, which started the Showa sequence, at which time, the numbering was matched to the last two, or later one digit of the Imperial Japanese calendar year. The Navy began assigning Shisaku numbers to denote experimental types being evaluated by the Navy, whose numbering matched those of the Showa sequence. As no new designs were assigned Type numbers between 26 December 1926 and the end of the year, no aircraft was designated Type 86 under the Showa sequence. The Taisho/Showa sequences were used for almost all equipment developed for both Army and Navy (including weapons, equipment, vehicles and even ships), so there can be many unrelated pieces of equipment covered under a single Type number.

<text>Métal hurlant (; literal translation: &quot;Howling Metal,&quot; &quot;Screaming Metal&quot;) is a French comics anthology of science fiction and horror comics stories. Originally created in 1974, the anthology ceased publication in 1987, but was revived between 2002 and 2004 in multilingual editions, and then again in 2020.

Emphasizing complex graphics, cinematic imagery and surreal storylines, &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; was highly influential throughout the world as one of the first mature expressions of &quot;adult&quot; comic book making. Apart from comics, the original &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; contained articles about science fiction books and movies, as well as music and videogame reviews. 

==History==
&quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; was created in December 1974 by comics artists Jean Giraud (better known as &quot;Mœbius&quot;) and Philippe Druillet together with journalist-writer Jean-Pierre Dionnet and financial director Bernard Farkas. The four were collectively known as &quot;Les Humanoïdes Associés&quot; (United Humanoids), which became the name of the publishing house releasing &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;. 

Content from &quot;Metal Hurlant&quot; was republished in English in the United States by National Lampoon under the title &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. It was published in Germany under the title &quot;Schwermetall&quot;.

The magazine was originally released quarterly; it consisted of 68 pages, of which only 16 were in colour. Contributors included Moebius and Druillet, depicting such characters as Arzach and Lone Sloane. Later issues featured Richard Corben, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Enki Bilal, Caza, Serge Clerc, Alain Voss, Berni Wrightson, Nicole Claveloux, Milo Manara, Frank Margerin, Masse, Chantal Montellier, and many others.

The magazine went bankrupt in 1980 but managed to keep publishing. It became bi-monthly with issue #7 and monthly with #9. 

&quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; ceased publication in July 1987.

===2002 revival===
&quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; began publishing again in July 2002 by Humanoids Publishing, with a French, English, Spanish and Portuguese version, under the French name. As a &quot;two-headed&quot;, transatlantic (France-US) magazine, led by Fabrice Giger in Los Angeles, it published original short stories, sometimes related to existing or to be published comic books. Its aim was to discover young creators and promote the products from the publisher. This incarnation of the magazine ceased publication with issue #14, dated November/December 2004.

===2021 revival===
Vincent Bernière launched &quot;Metal Hurlant&quot; for 2021. This third volume of &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; was launched via crowdfunding, on the KissKissBankBank platform. The first issue was published 29 September, with four issues a year (two with new content and two with classic content) planned. The third issue was published in March 2022, and included the story &quot;Aquarium&quot; by French author Léo Quievreux.

A Polish edition of the relaunched magazine, overlapping with reprints of classic issues, premiered in December 2021.

=== 2024 revival ===
In November 2024, Humanoids announced that they would be relaunching an English version of the magazine, and began a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the first issue on November 13, 2024.

==Stories==
Stories that were published in the original &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; include:

==Adaptations==
Some of their titles have gone on to be adapted into other media.

In November 2009, a film based on Stefano Raffaele&#x27;s &quot;Fragile&quot; was in development.

A live-action TV series based on &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; titled &quot;Métal Hurlant Chronicles&quot; was released in France in 2012–2014. A French-United Kingdom co-production, the series consists of 12 half-hour episodes over two seasons. Featured actors include Rutger Hauer, Scott Adkins, Michael Jai White, Karl E. Landler, Joe Flanigan, David Belle, Matt Mullins and James Marsters. In the United States, the series began airing on the Syfy Channel on 14 April 2014.

<text>Lundu (also spelled landu or landum) is a style of Afro-Brazilian music and dance with its origins in the African Bantu and Portuguese people.

==History==

The interconnectedness of Lusophone countries dates back to the Atlantic Slave Trade, between Portugal, Brazil and regions of Africa. In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the primary exporters of African slaves to the Americas, and with slaves came their musical traditions. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a massive Brazilian presence in Angola, enabling a cultural exchange between the two Portuguese colonies. This exchange enabled subtle amalgamations of musical styles between Angola, Brazil and other African slave trade countries. The establishment of a creole population in Brazil led to further cultural developments in language, religion and art. In 1859, French journalist Charles Ribeyrolles described Afro-Brazilian free practices on a &quot;fazenda&quot; in Rio de Janeiro province:

==Dissemination==

Records from the inquisition of the 18th century reveal that the Europeans initially considered gandus and lundus to be witchcraft. Many slave-owning Europeans in Brazil tolerated the dance in an attempt to avoid slave rebellion. Eventually, the style became attractive to Europeans in Brazil for its sexualized quality and its believed effectiveness in reversing witchcraft. de Mattos was disgruntled by the blurring by dance and drums of strict racial and cultural boundaries in Brazil.

Gradually, the lundu style grew in popularity among the elite population in Brazil. In 1749, Brazilian musician Manuel de Almeida Botelho immigrated to Lisbon, bringing with him the modinha and lundu musical styles. By the 19th century, lundu had become the music of choice for the Luso-Brazilian bourgeoisie. Historians have even called the style the “…most characteristic late 18th century [genre] of dance and song in Portugal and Brazil”.

==Style==

Lundus are characterized by varying structure, the interplay of tonic and dominant harmony, and strummed chords layered atop a syncopated rhythm reminiscent of traditional West African music. Limited recordings are available of traditional lundus style. Usually a flirtatious ritual of a couple dance, accompanied by a guitar, or sometimes a thumb piano or drums, Lundu is related to the Spanish fandango and other new-world dances like the Argentine Zamba, the Peruvian Zamacueca and the Cuban Bolero - they all involve, to some degree, handkerchiefs, castanets, and holding one&#x27;s arms above one&#x27;s head. In the 19th century, the lundu was one of the sources of the Choro, the Maxixe and the Samba.

<text>GNE (originally GNUPedia) was a project to create a free-content online encyclopedia, licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License, under the auspices of the Free Software Foundation. The project was proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000 and officially started in January 2001. It was moderated by Héctor Facundo Arena, an Argentine programmer and GNU activist.

== History ==
Immediately upon its creation, GNUPedia was confronted by confusion with the similar-sounding Nupedia project led by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, and controversy over whether this constituted a fork of the efforts to produce a free encyclopedia. In addition, Wales already owned the gnupedia.org domain name. The GNUPedia project changed its name to GNE (an abbreviation for &quot;GNE&#x27;s Not an Encyclopedia&quot;, a recursive acronym similar to that of the GNU Project) and switched to a knowledgebase. GNE was designed to avoid centralization and editors who enforced quality standards, which they viewed as possibly introducing bias. Jonathan Zittrain described GNE as a &quot;collective blog&quot; more than an encyclopedia. Stallman has since lent his support to Wikipedia.

In &quot;The Wikipedia Revolution&quot;, Andrew Lih explains the reasons behind the demise of GNE:
Richard Stallman who inspired the free software and free culture movement also proposed his own encyclopedia in 1999 and attempted to launch it in the same year that Wikipedia took off. Called Gnupedia it coexisted confusingly in the same space as Bomis&#x27;s Nupedia, a completely separate product. Keeping with tradition Stallman renamed his project GNE – GNE&#x27;s not an encyclopedia. But in the end Wikipedia&#x27;s lead and enthusiastic community was already well established and Richard Stallman put the GNE project into inactive status and put his support behind Wikipedia.

The GNU Project offers the following explanation about GNE:
Just as we were starting a project, GNUpedia, to develop a free encyclopedia, the Nupedia encyclopedia project adopted the GNU Free Documentation License and thus became a free commercial project. So we decided to merge GNUpedia project into Nupedia. Now, the Wikipedia encyclopedia project has adopted the philosophy of Nupedia and taken it even further. We encourage you to visit and contribute to the site.

<text>The three-striped night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), also known as northern night monkey or northern owl monkey, is one of several species of owl monkeys currently recognised. It is found in Venezuela and north-central Brazil.

Until 1983, all the owl monkeys were regarded as subspecies of &quot;Aotus trivirgatus&quot;, and all were referred to as douroucoulis. The use of the name douroucouli exclusively for the three-striped night monkey is not universally accepted; some authors use it for the entire genus, or for the grey-necked group of species within it (to which &quot;A. trivirgatus&quot; belongs).

Like other owl monkeys, the three-striped night monkey lives in woodlands including rain forest. It is mainly black, with striking white markings on its face. Its body size is 27–48 cm, and its tail is about the same length again. Adults weigh up to 1 kg. It has very large eyes, and is most active on moonlit nights, feeding on fruit, nuts, leaves, insects and other small invertebrates, and birds&#x27; eggs.

The three-striped night monkey forms pair bonds which are broken only by the death of one partner. It lives in family groups, with the immature young staying with their parents until sexual maturity at the age of 3 or 4. Normally only one infant is born, after a gestation period of a little over 4 months.

<doc id="515046" wikidata="Q657345" url="?curid=515046" title="Ticket machine">
<text>A ticket machine, also known as a ticket vending machine (TVM), is a vending machine that produces paper or electronic tickets, or recharges a stored-value card or smart card or the user&#x27;s mobile wallet, typically on a smartphone. For instance, ticket machines dispense train tickets at railway stations, transit tickets at metro stations and tram tickets at some tram stops and in some trams.  Token machines may dispense the ticket in the form of a token which has the same function as a paper or electronic ticket. The typical transaction consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a payment method of either cash, credit/debit card or smartcard. The ticket(s) are then printed on paper and dispensed to the user, or loaded onto the user&#x27;s smartcard or smartphone.

==Ticket and fare formats==
For most of the twentieth century, ticket machines issued paper tickets, or tokens worth one fare each. Later, fare value was loaded onto stored-value cards (first paper, later smart cards). Passengers could load any amount within a range; it did not necessarily have to correspond to any particular single fare. The cards could be reloaded until their expiration date, again with any monetary amount within a given range.

To encourage usage of ticket machines and reduce the need for salespersons, machine prices may in some cases be lower than those at a ticket counter.

==Timeline==
*1904: first self-service ticket machines on the Central London Railway, now part of London Underground
* 1954: Toronto Subway opens and has tokens in machines from day one
*1977: San Diego–based airline PSA introduces vending machines for airline tickets

== Staff-operated machines ==

Mechanical ticket machines were used by bus drivers and conductors since the late 1920s. Their functions may include printing tickets, recording of sales and payments. Some manufacturers are MicroFx, Almex, Setright, AEG, CAMP (Compagnie d&#x27;Ateliers Mecaniques de Precision), Gibson GFI Genfare, Parkeon, Xerox, Beckson and Corvia (Ticketer).

Since the 1970s (jobs), electronic computer terminals and printers are used.

Handheld ticket machines are used on buses in India to sell tickets, validate smart cards and renew passes. These machines replaced the earlier manual fare collection system where tickets were often punched to indicate journey and fare stages.

==Enforcement==
In many countries where trains and urban transport tickets operate largely on the honor system (with enforcement by roving inspectors or conductors), there are also machines in stations (or in vehicles) for validating tickets. This is for the situation where one buys a ticket in advance and decides to use it later. Usually, the ticket is time-stamped to determine its validity period. A common problem is forgetting to validate and then being fined as if one had no ticket at all. Such machines are generally not used in the United States. Nearly all American mass transit networks operating on the honor system expect their users to buy tickets immediately before use; regular riders can avoid that inconvenience by buying period passes in advance (often from the same machines that sell daily or one-time tickets). Recently, however, a handful of commuter rail systems like Metrolink have adopted the use of validation machines for at least some ticket types.

==Issues==

Ticket machines that are out of service or accept &#x27;exact change only&#x27; result in losses for transport providers.

==Applications==
Ticket machines are also often used for amusement parks, cinemas (in those cases sometimes called ticketing kiosks), car parking (see pay and display), as well as those that issue free tickets—for example, those for virtual queueing.

Japan uses ticket machines in restaurants, cafes and other establishments. Customers select an item on the machine, insert money into the machine then receive a voucher that can be exchanged for their order, unlike a vending machine where the customer would receive their item. Some ticket machines are standalone machines while other versions of the machine are located at the counter.

<doc id="515052" wikidata="Q2887556" url="?curid=515052" title="Lake Eyre basin">
<text>The Lake Eyre basin ( ) is a drainage basin that covers just under one-sixth of all Australia. It is the largest endorheic basin in Australia and amongst the largest in the world, covering about , including much of inland Queensland, large portions of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and a part of western New South Wales. The basin is also one of the largest, least-developed arid zone basins with a high degree of variability anywhere. It supports only about 60,000 people and has no major irrigation, diversions or flood-plain developments. Low density grazing that sustains a large amount of wildlife is the major land use, occupying 82% of the total land within the basin. The Lake Eyre basin of precipitation (rain water) to a great extent geographically overlaps the Great Artesian Basin underneath.

The basin began as a sinking landmass mostly covered by forest and contained many more lakes than now. The climate has changed from wet to arid over the last 60 million years. Most of the rivers in the Lake Eyre basin are now slow flowing, flat and completely dry for lengthy periods. When the country north of the basin floods, floodwaters drain via the main rivers of the basin, Cooper Creek, Georgina River and Diamantina River southwards towards Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, the country&#x27;s lowest point at below sea level. The water overflows the river banks, across the floodplains, filling waterholes and wetlands and carving new channels, giving rise to the name Channel Country. Most of the rain which falls in the north never reaches the lake 1,000 km away, which only fills occasionally.

Management of the area has been problematic as it is covered by four different states&#x27; jurisdictions. As the ecological significance of the basin has become known and mismanagement of another Australian basin, the Murray-Darling Basin, became apparent during several drought cycles, it became clear that ongoing management issues had to be resolved. In 2001 the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was signed, which was set up to ensure the sustainability of the Lake Eyre Basin river systems.

In 2014, the Queensland Government changed the laws protecting the rivers and floodplains. there are fears that mining for coal seam gas could be very detrimental to the fragile environment of the floodplains.

==Geology==

The basin began to form in the early Paleogene (about 60 million years ago) when south-eastern South Australia started to sink and rivers began to deposit sediment into the large, shallow basin. A remnant of an old oceanic plate is currently sinking in the mantle beneath the basin. The suction effect of this sinking likely caused both the Lake Eyre Basin as well as the Murray-Darling basin to form. The basin is still gradually sinking, and still gradually accumulating sediment. For many millions of years, the Lake Eyre Basin was well supplied with water and largely forested. About 20 million years ago, large shallow lakes formed, covering much of the area for about 10 million years. From that time on, as Australia drifted further north and the climate became gradually more arid, the lakes and floodplains started to dry. Only in the last 2.6 million years did the onset of the ice ages bring about the present climatic regime and the consequent fairly rapid desertification of the area.

The basin covers just under one-sixth of all Australia and is the largest endorheic basin in Australia and amongst the largest in the world, covering about , including much of inland Queensland, large portions of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and a part of western New South Wales.

== Geography ==
During years of especially high rainfall, all the riverbeds in this vast, mostly flat, arid and semi-arid area lead inland (not towards the sea) towards Lake Eyre in central South Australia.

Lake Eyre itself lies approximately below sea level, and usually contains only salt. In flood years, it fills and, for a short time, undergoes a period of rapid growth and fertility: long-dormant marine creatures multiply and large flocks of waterfowl arrive to feed and raise their young before the waters evaporate once more. The annual mean runoff in the Lake Eyre Basin is lowest of any of the world&#x27;s major drainage basins.

None of the creeks and rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin are permanent: they flow only after heavy rain – a rare to very rare event in the arid interior of Australia. Average annual rainfall in the area surrounding Lake Eyre is , and the pan evaporation rate is . Annualised average figures are misleading: since 1885 annual rainfall over the of the Lake Eyre Basin has ranged from about in 1928 to over in 1974. Most of the water reaching Lake Eyre comes from the river systems of semi-arid inland Queensland, roughly to the north.

To provide a sense of scale, the Lake Eyre Basin is about the size of France, Germany and Italy combined. It is slightly larger than the Murray-Darling basin (which drains inland eastern Australia and is responsible for a large proportion of the continent&#x27;s agricultural productivity) but has vastly less water. Nevertheless, the entire flow of the Murray-Darling would be insufficient to fill Lake Eyre, merely keeping pace with evaporation. (In contrast, the flow of the Mississippi could fill Lake Eyre in 22 days, that of the Amazon in just three days.)

Other lakes in the basin include Lake Frome, Lake Yamma Yamma and Lake Hart.

The basin is also one of the largest, least-developed arid zone basins with a high degree of variability anywhere. It supports about 60,000 people and a large amount of wildlife, and has no major irrigation, diversions or flood-plain developments.

=== Rivers ===

The Cooper Creek, Finke River, Georgina River and Diamantina River are the four main rivers of the basin. Other desert rivers include the Hale River, Plenty River and Todd River that flow from the south east of the Northern Territory, south. In the western parts of the basin the Neales River and Macumba River flow into Lake Eyre.

Rivers within the basin have a low gradient, slow flow rate and a naturally turbid water quality. Several of the major Lake Eyre Basin river systems are well-known. Because the Lake Eyre Basin is almost flat, rivers flow slowly and frequently split up into floodplains or multiple braided channels. Water is lost to evaporation, to seepage, and in the many ephemeral wetland systems, with the result that downstream flows are typically smaller than upstream flows. Only in exceptional years is there sufficient upstream rain to provide a flow into Lake Eyre itself.

The Finke River, starting roughly west of Alice Springs is thought to be the oldest riverbed in the world and although it flows for only a few days a year (in many years it does not flow at all) is home to seven species of fish, two of which are found nowhere else. The waters of the Finke disappear into the sands of the Simpson Desert and are not definitely known to ever make it as far south as Lake Eyre, although the story is told that this happened once early in the 20th century. In extreme events, water from the Finke River flows into the Macumba River, which empties into Lake Eyre, a total distance from headwater streams of around . Major tributaries include Ellery Creek, and the Palmer and Hugh Rivers.

The Georgina River system originates on the Barkly Tableland, near the Northern Territory-Queensland border, north-west of Mount Isa and not far south of the Gulf of Carpentaria. In this relatively humid northern area, rainfall can be as high as per year and evaporation as low as . The Georgina flows through innumerable channels leading south through far-western Queensland for over , eventually reaching Goyder Lagoon in the north-eastern corner of South Australia.

Australia&#x27;s early bush poets immortalised the Diamantina River, making it a symbol of the remote outback. It too rises in northern Queensland, roughly between Mount Isa and Winton, flowing 800 kilometres south and west through Birdsville and the Channel Country to join the Georgina at Goyder Lagoon (and then, if there is sufficient flow, down Warburton Creek towards Lake Eyre).

Of all the Lake Eyre Basin river systems, however, Cooper Creek is by far the most famous, in particular because it was along Cooper Creek that the explorers Burke and Wills met their deaths. It rises in the form of two central Queensland rivers, the Thomson between Longreach and Charters Towers, and the Barcoo in the area around Barcaldine, about inland from Rockhampton. Cooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of meandering ephemeral channels, making its way roughly south into the far south-west corner of Queensland before turning due west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre. It takes almost a year for water to reach Lake Eyre from the headwaters. In most years, none does: it is absorbed into the earth, goes to fill channels and the many permanent waterholes, or simply evaporates. Water from Cooper Creek reached Lake Eyre in 1990 and then not again until 2010.

=== Deserts ===
The deserts that have formed in the basin, including Sturt Stony Desert, Tirari Desert and the Strzelecki Desert, are most probably the southern hemisphere&#x27;s largest source of airborne dust.

==Fauna==
A total of 27 individual species of fish are found in Lake Eyre basin, with 13 of them being endemic. The largest fish species is the Macquaria, reaching a maximum weight of about .

==Traditional owners==
&quot;Wangkangurru (&quot;also known as &quot;Arabana/Wangkangurru, Wangganguru, Wanggangurru, Wongkangurru)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Wangkangurru country. It is closely related to Arabana language of South Australia. The Wangkangurru language region was traditionally in the South Australian-Queensland border region taking in Birdsville and extending south towards Innamincka and Lake Eyre, including the local government areas of the Shire of Diamantina as well as the Outback Communities Authority of South Australia.

==Management==
Indigenous Australians have lived with the cycles of the land for thousands of years and traditional owners are protective of its natural systems.

Management of the area has been problematic as it is covered by four different states&#x27; jurisdictions. As the ecological significance of the basin has become known and mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin became apparent during several drought cycles, it became clear that ongoing management issues had to be resolved. In 2001 the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was signed, and the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was set up to ensure the sustainability of the Lake Eyre Basin river systems, particularly to avoid or eliminate cross-border impacts. The Lake Eyre Basin Ministerial Forum was established as the decision making body responsible for overseeing of the Agreement. The Ministerial Forum created a Community Advisory Committee to provide advice and facilitate community participation and a Scientific Advisory Panel to advise on scientific and technical issues. On 7 September 2018 the Lake Eyre Basin Ministerial Forum agreed to release the second review of the agreement.

===Land use and mining===
Low density grazing is the major land use, occupying 82% of the total land within the basin. Significant minerals deposits such as oil and natural gas, including Australia&#x27;s most significant onshore petroleum reserves, are found within the basin. The mining and petroleum industries account for the greatest economic activity in the Lake Eyre Basin. Opals, coal, phosphate, gypsum and uranium are also mined from the basin.

In 2009, the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that heavy metals from mining operations near Mount Isa had entered the upper reaches of the Georgina River. The spill has the potential to contaminate parts of the basin as far south as Lake Eyre.

In 2014, the Queensland Government changed the laws protecting the rivers and floodplains, which, according to environmentalists, could lead to shale gas mining or fracking in the area.

 there are fears that mining for coal seam gas could be very detrimental to the fragile environment of the floodplains.

===Protected areas===
The Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park, Strzelecki Regional Reserve, Witjira National Park, Sturt National Park, Diamantina National Park, and Simpson Desert National Park are among a number of protected areas established within the Lake Eyre Basin.

===River diversion schemes===

The Bradfield Scheme was an ambitious proposal by Dr John Bradfield in 1938. It would use large pipes, tunnels, pumps and dams to divert water from the monsoon-fed Tully, Herbert and Burdekin rivers into the Thomson River, Queensland. After a critical review in 1947 support for the scheme fell through. However, in the 2010s interest in various updated or amended Bradfield schemes have increased among various politicians.

Other less-developed diversion schemes have been proposed to divert river or sea water into the Lake Eyre Basin from time to time.

<doc id="515053" wikidata="Q185134" url="?curid=515053" title="Tlemcen">
<text>Tlemcen (; ) is the second-largest city in northwestern Algeria after Oran and is the capital of Tlemcen Province. The city has developed leather, carpet, and textile industries, which it exports through the port of Rachgoun. It had a population of 140,158, as of the 2008 census.

A major centre of the Central Maghreb, the city is a mix of Arab, Berber, &#x27;Āndalusī, Ottoman, and Western influences. From this mosaic of influences, the city derives the title of capital of Andalusian art in Algeria. Various titles are attributed to the city including &quot;the Pearl of the Maghreb&quot;, &quot;the African Granada&quot; and &quot;the Medina of the West&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name Tlemcen (&quot;Tilimsān&quot;) was given by the Zayyanid King Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan. One possible etymology is that it comes from a Berber word &quot;tilmas&quot;, meaning &quot;spring, water-hole&quot;, or from the combination of the Berber words &quot;tala&quot; (&quot;fountain&quot;), the preposition &quot;m-&quot;, and &quot;sān&quot; (&quot;two&quot;), thus meaning &quot;two fountains&quot;. Another proposed etymology is from the Zanata words &quot;talam&quot; (&quot;junction&quot;) and &quot;sān&quot; (&quot;two&quot;), referring to the town&#x27;s geographic position which links the desert regions to the south with the mountainous regions to the north.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The areas surrounding Tlemcen were inhabited during the Neolithic period, as evidenced by the discovery of polished axes in the caves of Boudghene by Gustave-Marie Bleicher in 1875.

There are three important prehistoric sites in the region: lake Karar, located one kilometer south of Remchi; the rock shelters of Mouilah, 5 km north of Maghnia; and the deposit called &quot;d&#x27;Ouzidan&quot;, 2 km west of Aïn El Hout. The shelters found at the Mouilah and Boudghene show evidence of long periods of pre-historic human habitation.

===Antiquity===
In AD 17, Tacfarinas led the Gaetuli to revolt against the Romans.

Tlemcen became a military outpost of Ancient Rome in the 2nd century CE under the name of Pomaria. It was then an important city in the North Africa see of the Roman Catholic Church, where it was the center of a diocese. Its bishop, Victor, was a prominent representative at the Council of Carthage (411), and its bishop Honoratus was exiled in 484 by the Vandal king Huneric for denying Arianism.

It was a center of a large Christian population for many centuries after the city&#x27;s Arab conquest in 708 AD.

=== Early Islamic period ===
In the later eighth century and the ninth century, the city became a Kingdom of Banu Ifran with a Sufri Kharijite orientation. These same Berber Kharijis also began to develop various small Saharan oases and to link them into regular trans-Saharan caravan routes terminating at Tlemcen, beginning a process that would determine Tlemcen&#x27;s historical role for almost all of the next millennium. In the late 8th century a settlement named Agadir existed on the site of former Roman Pomaria. Idris I founded a congregational mosque here, the Great Mosque of Agadir, circa 790 (no longer extant).

In 1081 or 1082 the Almoravid leader Yusuf ibn Tashfin founded the city of Tagrart (&quot;encampment&quot; in Berber language), just west of Agadir. The fusion of the two settlements of Tagrart and Agadir over time became what is now Tlemcen. At the same time as he founded Tagrart, Ibn Tashfin founded its congregational mosque, known today as the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, which was expanded in 1126 by his son and successor &#x27;Ali Ibn Yusuf. He built a governor&#x27;s residence next to it, known after as the &quot;Qasr al-Qadim&quot; (&quot;Old Palace&quot;).

Control of the region passed from the Almoravids to the Almohad Caliphate in the mid-twelfth century. After its conquest, the Almohad ruler &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min surrounded the city with a wall in 1145 and built a new citadel. However, in the early thirteenth century, &#x27;Abdallah ibn Ghaniya attempted to restore Almoravid control of the Maghreb. In about 1209, the region around Tlemcen was devastated by retreating Almoravid forces, not long before their final defeat by the Almohads at the Battle of Jebel Nafusa in 1210. Despite the destruction of Tlemcen&#x27;s already-feeble agricultural base, Tlemcen rose to prominence as a major trading and administrative center in the region under the ensuing reign of the Almohads.

===Zayyanid period===

After the end of Almohad rule in the 1230s, Tlemcen became the capital of one of the three successor states, the Zayyanid Kingdom of Tlemcen (1236–1554). The Zayyanid ruler Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan succeeded in merging Agadir and Tagrart into a single city and gave it the name Tlemcen. Initially, Yagmurasen resided in the &quot;Qasr al-Qadim&quot; but he soon moved the seat of power to a new citadel, the Mechouar, towards the mid 13th century. The city was thereafter ruled for centuries by successive Zayyanid sultans. During this era it was one of the most important economic and cultural centers in the region, alongside other political capitals like Fez, Tunis, and Granada. During the Middle Ages, Tlemcen not only served as a trading city connecting the &quot;coastal&quot; route across the Maghreb with the trans-Saharan caravan routes, but also housed a European trading center, or funduk which connected African and European merchants. African gold arrived in Tlemcen from south of the Sahara through Sijilmasa or Taghaza and entered European hands. Consequently, Tlemcen was partially integrated into the European financial system. For example, Genoese bills of exchange circulated there, at least among merchants not subject to (or not deterred by) religious prohibitions.

At the peak of its success in the first half of the fourteenth century, Tlemcen was a city of perhaps 40,000 inhabitants. It housed several well-known madrasas and numerous wealthy religious foundations, and became the principal centers of culture in the central Maghreb. The Zayyanids were the first to sponsor of the construction of madrasas in this part of the Maghreb, and among the most famous in Tlemcen was the Tashfiniya Madrasa founded by Abu Tashfin I (r. 1318–1337). At the souk around the Great Mosque, merchants sold woolen fabrics and rugs from the East, slaves and gold from across the Sahara, local earthenware and leather goods, and a variety of Mediterranean maritime goods &quot;redirected&quot; to Tlemcen by corsairs—in addition to imported European goods available at the funduk. Merchant houses based in Tlemcen, such as the al-Makkari, maintained regular branch offices in Mali and the Sudan.

Later in the fourteenth century, the city twice fell under the rule of the Marinid sultan, Abu al-Hasan Ali (1337–1348) and his son Abu &#x27;Inan. Both times the Marinids found that they were unable to hold the region against local resistance. Nevertheless, these episodes appear to have marked the beginning of the end. Over the following two centuries, Zayyanid Tlemcen was intermittently a vassal of Ifriqiya (then governed by the Hafsid dynasty), Maghrib al-Aqsa (then governed by the Marinid dynasty), or Aragon. When the Spanish took the city of Oran from the Zayyanids in 1509, continuous pressure from the Berbers prompted the Spanish to start a campaign against Tlemcen in 1543, which ended in the capture of the city and in the installation of a vassal king on the throne.

The ruler of Tlemcen is reported to have been advised by a Jewish viceroy named Abraham, who, in the time of the Inquisition of Torquemada, opened the gates of Tlemcen to Jewish and Muslim refugees fleeing Spain. Abraham is said to have supported them with his own money and with the tolerance of the king of Tlemcen.

===Later years===
In 1551, Tlemcen came under Ottoman rule after the Campaign of Tlemcen. Tlemcen and the Algerian provinces regained effective independence in their own affairs in 1671, although Tlemcen was no longer a government seat as before. The Spanish were evicted from Oran in 1792, but thirty years later, they were replaced by the French, who seized Algiers. A French fleet bombarded Algiers in 1830, at which point the dey capitulated to French colonial rule; a broad coalition of natives continued to resist, coordinated loosely at Tlemcen.

Tlemcen was a vacation spot and retreat for French settlers in Algeria, who found it far more temperate than Oran or Algiers. The city adapted and became more cosmopolitan, with a unique outlook on art and culture, and its architecture and urban life evolved to accommodate this new sense. In the independence movements of the mid-twentieth century, it was relatively quiet, reflecting the city&#x27;s sense of aloofness from the turbulence of Algiers. In 1943 Tlemcen was little more than a railway halt. On January 13 a British and American train patrol engaged in a skirmish with the retreating troops of the Afrika Korps. As the US Army marched eastwards from its Moroccan landing grounds, the British 8th Army drove west, forcing the Germans into an evacuation pocket at Tunis. Between 1942–1943, before embarking for Italy, the US Army Medical Corps established two fixed hospitals at Tlemcen: 9th Evacuation (as station), 12–26 December 1942. Seven hundred and fifty beds and 32d Station, 28 February – 28 November 1943, 500 beds.

The most important place for pilgrimage of all religions into Tlemcen was the Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of town. Up to 10,000 people worldwide made the journey to the site. Nonetheless, despite religious freedoms, their community had never numbered more than 5,000–6,000 in the 20th century, and discriminatory laws of had been in force since 1881. After Algerian independence in 1962, most of the small Jewish population evacuated to metropolitan France. The Berber tribes historically professed Judaism. During the colonial period they served in the French Army. French Jews of the Alliance Israélite Universelle paid for a local Jewish school, which closed in 1934, perhaps owing to the rise of Fascism. In 2009 Jordanian sources reported that the Algerian government intended to restore the damaged Jewish tombs at the historic cemetery.

==Climate==
Tlemcen has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;).
== Culture ==
Its centuries of rich history and culture have made the city a center of a unique blend of music and art. Its textiles and handcrafts, its elegant display of Andalusi culture, and its cool climate in the mountains have made it an important center of tourism in Algeria. It is home to a tomb—that of Sidi Boumédiène, whose tomb adjoins a mosque. The Great Mosque of Tlemcen was completed in 1136 and is said to be the most remarkable remaining example of Almoravid architecture.

<doc id="515055" wikidata="Q3631559" url="?curid=515055" title="The Man-eaters of Tsavo">
<text>The Man-eaters of Tsavo is a semi-autobiographical book written by Anglo-Irish military officer and hunter John Henry Patterson. Published in 1907, it recounts his experiences in East Africa while supervising the construction of a railroad bridge over the Tsavo river in Kenya, in 1898. It is titled after a pair of man-eating lions that terrorized the undertaking for nine months until they were shot by Patterson. His recounting of this incident projected him to fame, and it remains the subject of debate to this day. It has also been the basis of numerous films, the best known being &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996), starring Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas.

== Overview ==
Following the death of the lions, the book tells of the bridge&#x27;s completion in spite of additional challenges (such as a fierce flood) as well as many stories concerning local wildlife (including other lions) local tribes, the discovery of the maneaters&#x27; cave and various hunting expeditions.

An appendix contains advice to sportsmen visiting British East Africa. The book also includes photographs taken by Patterson at the time which include the railway construction; the workers; local tribes; scenery and wildlife; and the man-eaters.

Several publications about and studies of the man-eating lions of Tsavo have been inspired by Patterson&#x27;s account. The book has been adapted to film three times: a monochrome, British film of the 1950s, a 1952 3-D film titled &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, and a 1996 color version called &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, where Val Kilmer played the daring engineer who hunts down the lions of Tsavo.

== Historicity of the account of the man-eaters ==
The Victorian style of the prose may appear today as overwritten; however, the editor&#x27;s note to the 1986 reprint claims that the facts suggest that some aspects were actually downplayed, such as the death of Haslem, about which more grisly facts are known. The book describes attacks by two man-eating lions on workers building the Uganda Railway through British East Africa in 1898 and how the pair were eventually killed by Patterson. It was remarkable that 135 people were killed by the man-eaters in less than a year before Patterson managed to kill them (although this number is contested, it is not disproven).

Patterson&#x27;s 1907 book itself states that &quot;between them [the lions] no less than 28 Indian coolies, in addition to scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was kept&quot; were killed. Later accounts exaggerated this number: 135 &#x27;Indian and African artisans and labourers&#x27; (Patterson, 1925), &#x27;135 armed men&#x27; (Patterson &amp; Neiburger, 2000) and 140 (Caputo, 2000). In 2001, Julian Kerbis Peterhans and Tom Gnoske published their definitive paper on man-eating behavior among lions with special reference to the Tsavo situation. They documented between 28 and 31 victims. This lesser number was confirmed in Dr. Bruce Patterson&#x27;s definitive book &quot;The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa&#x27;s Notorious Man-Eaters.&quot; He showed that the greater toll attributed to the lions resulted from a pamphlet written by Colonel Patterson in 1925, stating &quot;these two ferocious brutes killed and devoured, under the most appalling circumstances, 135 Indian and African artisans and laborers employed in the construction of the Uganda Railway.&quot;

The skins of the lions may be found at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.

== Setting ==
The book is set in East Africa. The nearest large city to the man-eater attacks is Mombasa, the largest city then and second largest city now in Kenya. The Tsavo man-eater attacks occurred while working on the Uganda Railway. The railway reached Lake Victoria at Port Florence, now Kisumu, which at that time was in Uganda territory. It was separate from railway developments elsewhere in East Africa, for instance in German-run Tanganyika.

The railway project was controversial and the British Press referred to it as &quot;The Lunatic Express&quot;, as critics considered it a waste of funds, while supporters argued it was necessary for transportation of goods.

== Plot ==
Colonel John Patterson is to build a bridge in East Africa (later Kenya). While he is working on this, two man-eating lions show up. They will stop at nothing for a bite of human flesh and the first attempts to stalk, capture or keep them out of the camp fail. They attack the camp hospital and kill a patient. Even after the hospital is moved, one lion penetrates the thick, thorn fence called a boma built to protect it and drags the water carrier away to his death. In the course of hunting these lions, Patterson encounters a red spitting cobra, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a pack of wild dogs, a wildebeest that faked dying, and a herd of zebra, of which he captured six. He also shoots a new type of antelope, T. oryx pattersonianus. Eventually, the first lion is defeated by baiting it with a tethered donkey while Patterson keeps watch from an elevated stand – though for a few tense moments Patterson himself becomes the hunted. Patterson and Mahina hunt the second lion on the plains. When they find and shoot it, the lion charges them and it takes repeated shots to bring it down.

The lions are not the only challenge to completing the bridge project. Tensions between native workers and Sikhs brought in from British East India to work on the project (coolies) threaten to stop the project. At one point, Patterson meets a danger far greater than the lions – a fierce flood. It wipes out the supply bridges and wraps iron girders around tree trunks like wire. Uprooted tree trunks act like battering rams trying to annihilate the bridge. But the well-built bridge stays intact. This challenge proves that the year spent working on the bridge has not been wasted.

Some time after Patterson completes the bridge, he learns of the death of his friend, Railway Police Superintendent Charles H. Ryall. Ryall had learned of a man-eating lion preying on railway staff at Kima station, notably an incident where it had tried to break through the station&#x27;s roof. In response, he went to Kima with two companions, intending to shoot the lion before it attacked again. Ryall set up an ambush from his personal railway carriage, but saw nothing, and, perhaps deciding that the lion would not appear, retired for the night. Later that night, the man-eater broke into Ryall&#x27;s carriage. The three hunters were in the main compartment, and an uncertain number of coolies in the adjoining one. The lion went for Ryall immediately, standing on one of his companions in order to get to him. The third man, in an effort to get to the other section, leapt onto the lion&#x27;s back, and tried desperately to open the door. The coolies, who had been holding the door shut with their turbans, opened it just wide enough for him to get through, and then tied it shut again. Immediately afterwards, the lion leapt out the window with Ryall, leaving the remaining hunter to seek refuge in the station. Some time later, a member of the railway staff trapped the lion, which was displayed alive for several days, then shot.

Another close encounter with a lion occurs when a lion is aboard a gharri, a means of transportation in Kenya similar to a small trolley. Another time, on the way back to the train station, Patterson converses with a friend who has never shot a lion. A couple of hundred yards away, Patterson points out a pair of lions and encourages the friend to shoot them. One runs off at the first shot, but he successfully bags the other lion. The end of the book includes a photo of the lion that the friend killed.

When the time comes for Patterson to leave, some of the coolies and the natives want to go with him. However, Patterson knows that they do not have the immune defense system to combat the diseases outside of Africa. So he politely says no and leaves Africa for some years. (He later returns to Africa, but this part of his life is not recorded in this book.)

<text>Diabetic neuropathy includes various types of nerve damage associated with diabetes mellitus. The most common form, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, affects 30% of all diabetic patients. Symptoms depend on the site of nerve damage and can include motor changes such as weakness; sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or pain; or autonomic changes such as urinary symptoms. These changes are thought to result from a microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum). Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include distal symmetric polyneuropathy; third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsy; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; and autonomic neuropathy.

==Signs and symptoms==

Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.

===Sensorimotor polyneuropathy===

Longer nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve&#x27;s length. In this syndrome, decreased sensation and loss of reflexes occur first in the toes on each foot, then extend upward. It is usually described as a glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, dysesthesia and nighttime pain. The pain can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull. A pins and needles sensation is common. Loss of proprioception, the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. These patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are developing a callus from an ill-fitting shoe. Consequently, they are at risk of developing ulcers and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to amputation. Similarly, these patients can get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint. Loss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, contractures of the toes, and loss of the interosseous muscle function that leads to contraction of the digits, so-called hammer toes. These contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand where the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal. The loss of muscular function is progressive.

===Autonomic neuropathy===

The autonomic nervous system is composed of nerves serving the heart, lungs, blood vessels, bone, adipose tissue, sweat glands, gastrointestinal system and genitourinary system. Autonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems. One commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetics is orthostatic hypotension, or becoming dizzy and possibly fainting when standing up due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. In the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, it is due to the failure of the heart and arteries to appropriately adjust heart rate and vascular tone to keep blood continually and fully flowing to the brain. This symptom is usually accompanied by a loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia – the usual change in heart rate seen with normal breathing. These two findings suggest autonomic neuropathy.

Gastrointestinal manifestations include gastroparesis, nausea, bloating, and diarrhea. Because many diabetics take oral medication for their diabetes, absorption of these medicines is greatly affected by the delayed gastric emptying. This can lead to hypoglycemia when an oral diabetic agent is taken before a meal and does not get absorbed until hours, or sometimes days later when there is normal or low blood sugar already. Sluggish movement of the small intestine can cause bacterial overgrowth, made worse by the presence of hyperglycemia. This leads to bloating, gas and diarrhea.

Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and retention. Again, because of the retention of urine, urinary tract infections are frequent. Urinary retention can lead to bladder diverticula, kidney stones, and reflux nephropathy.

===Cranial neuropathy===
When cranial nerves are affected, neuropathies of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve #3 or CNIII) are most common. The oculomotor nerve controls all the muscles that move the eye except for the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. It also serves to constrict the pupil and open the eyelid. The onset of a diabetic third nerve palsy is usually abrupt, beginning with frontal or pain around the eye and then double vision. All the oculomotor muscles innervated by the third nerve may be affected, but those that control pupil size are usually well-preserved early on. This is because the parasympathetic nerve fibers within CNIII that influence pupillary size are found on the periphery of the nerve (in terms of a cross-sectional view), which makes them less susceptible to ischemic damage (as they are closer to the vascular supply). The sixth nerve, the abducens nerve, which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye (moves the eye laterally), is also commonly affected but fourth nerve, the trochlear nerve, (innervates the superior oblique muscle, which moves the eye downward) involvement is unusual. Damage to a specific nerve of the thoracic or lumbar spinal nerves can occur and may lead to painful syndromes that mimic a heart attack, gallbladder inflammation, or appendicitis. Diabetics have a higher incidence of entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

==Pathogenesis==
The following processes are thought to be involved in the development of diabetic neuropathy:

===Microvascular disease===

Vascular and neural diseases are closely related. Blood vessels depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depend on adequate blood flow. The first pathological change in the small blood vessels is narrowing of the blood vessels. As the disease progresses, neuronal dysfunction correlates closely with the development of blood vessel abnormalities, such as capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished oxygen tension and hypoxia. Neuronal ischemia is a well-established characteristic of diabetic neuropathy. Blood vessel opening agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors, α1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow, with corresponding improvements in nerve conduction velocities. Thus, small blood vessel dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.

===Advanced glycated end products===

Elevated levels of glucose within cells cause a non-enzymatic covalent bonding with proteins, which alters their structure and inhibits their function. Some of these glycated proteins have been implicated in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy and other long-term complications of diabetes.

===Polyol pathway===

Also called the sorbitol/aldose reductase pathway, the polyol pathway appears to be implicated in diabetic complications, especially in microvascular damage to the retina, kidney, and nerves.

==Diagnosis==
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations. Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely. Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition. Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy.

=== Classification ===
Diabetic neuropathy encompasses a series of different neuropathic syndromes which can be categorized as follows:
* Focal and multifocal neuropathies:
** Mononeuropathy which affects one nerve
** Amyotrophy or radiculopathy such as proximal diabetic neuropathy, affecting a specific pattern of nerves
** Multiple lesions, affecting nerves that don&#x27;t follow a specific pattern, also called &quot;mononeuritis multiplex&quot;
** Nerve damage from entrapment (e.g. median, ulnar, peroneal)
* Symmetrical neuropathies:
** Sensory
** Autonomic
** Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN), the diabetic type of which is also known as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) (most common presentation)

==Prevention==

Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications. Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.

==Treatment==
===Blood glucose management===
Treatment of early manifestations of sensorimotor polyneuropathy involves improving glycemic control. Tight control of blood glucose can reverse the changes of diabetic neuropathy if the neuropathy and diabetes are recent in onset. This is the primary treatment of diabetic neuropathy that may change the course of the condition as the other treatments focus on reducing pain and other symptoms.

===Topical agents===
Capsaicin applied to the skin in a 0.075% concentration has not been found to be more effective than placebo for treating pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions for more concentrated forms of capsaicin, clonidine, or lidocaine applied to the skin. About 10% of people who use capsaicin cream have a large benefit.

=== Medications ===
Medication options for pain control include antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

A systematic review concluded that &quot;tricyclic antidepressants and traditional anticonvulsants are better for short term pain relief than newer generation anticonvulsants.&quot; A further analysis of previous studies showed that the agents carbamazepine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and amitriptyline were more effective than placebo, but that comparative effectiveness between each agent is unclear.

The only three medications approved by the United States&#x27; Food and Drug Administration for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) are the antidepressant duloxetine, the anticonvulsant pregabalin, and the long-acting opioid tapentadol ER (extended release). Before trying a systemic medication, some doctors recommend treating localized diabetic peripheral neuropathy with lidocaine patches.

====Antiepileptic drugs====
Multiple guidelines from medical organizations such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Academy of Neurology, European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend AEDs, such as pregabalin, as first-line treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy. Pregabalin is supported by low-quality evidence as more effective than placebo for reducing diabetic neuropathic pain but its effect is small. Studies have reached differing conclusions about whether gabapentin relieves pain more effectively than placebo. Available evidence is insufficient to determine if zonisamide or carbamazepine are effective for diabetic neuropathy. The first metabolite of carbamazepine, known as oxcarbazepine, appears to have a small beneficial effect on pain. A 2014 systematic review and network meta-analysis concluded topiramate, valproic acid, lacosamide, and lamotrigine are ineffective for pain from diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The most common side effects associated with AED use include sleepiness, dizziness, and nausea.

====Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors====
As above, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) duloxetine and venlafaxine are recommended in multiple medical guidelines as first or second-line therapy for DPN. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded there is moderate quality evidence that duloxetine and venlafaxine each provide a large benefit in reducing diabetic neuropathic pain. Common side effects include dizziness, nausea, and sleepiness.

====Tricyclic antidepressants====
TCAs include imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, and nortriptyline. They are generally regarded as first or second-line treatment for DPN. Of the TCAs, imipramine has been the best studied. These medications are effective at decreasing painful symptoms but lead to multiple side effects that are dose-dependent. One notable side effect is cardiac toxicity, which can lead to fatal abnormal heart rhythms. Additional common side effects include dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, and sedation. At low dosages used for neuropathy, toxicity is rare, but if symptoms warrant higher doses, complications are more common. Among the TCAs, amitriptyline is most widely used for this condition, but desipramine and nortriptyline have fewer side effects.

====Opioids====
Typical opioid medications, such as oxycodone, appear to be no more effective than placebo. In contrast, low-quality evidence supports a moderate benefit from the use of atypical opioids (e.g., tramadol and tapentadol), which also have SNRI properties. Opioid medications are recommended as second or third-line treatment for DPN.

===Medical devices===
Monochromatic infrared photo energy treatment (MIRE) has been shown to be an effective therapy in reducing and often eliminating pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. The studied wavelength of 890 nm is able to penetrate into the subcutaneous tissue where it acts upon a specialized part of the cell called the cytochrome C. The infrared light energy prompts the cytochrome C to release nitric oxide into the cells. The nitric oxide in turn promotes vasodilation which results in increased blood flow that helps nourish damaged nerve cells. Once the nutrient rich blood is able to reach the affected areas (typically the feet, lower legs and hands) it promotes the regeneration of nerve tissues and helps reduce inflammation thereby reducing and/or eliminating pain in the area.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential current (IFC) use a painless electric current and the physiological effects from low frequency electrical stimulation to relieve stiffness, improve mobility, relieve neuropathic pain, reduce oedema, and heal resistant foot ulcers.

===Physical therapy===
Physical therapy may help reduce dependency on pain relieving drug therapies. Certain physiotherapy techniques can help alleviate symptoms brought on from diabetic neuropathy such as deep pain in the feet and legs, tingling or burning sensation in extremities, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, sexual dysfunction, and diabetic foot.

Gait training, posture training, and teaching these patients the basic principles of off-loading can help prevent and/or stabilize foot complications such as foot ulcers. Off-loading techniques can include the use of mobility aids (e.g. crutches) or foot splints. Gait re-training would also be beneficial for individuals who have lost limbs, due to diabetic neuropathy, and now wear a prosthesis.

Exercise programs, along with manual therapy, will help to prevent muscle contractures, spasms and atrophy. These programs may include general muscle stretching to maintain muscle length and a person&#x27;s range of motion. General muscle strengthening exercises will help to maintain muscle strength and reduce muscle wasting. Aerobic exercise such as swimming and using a stationary bicycle can help peripheral neuropathy, but activities that place excessive pressure on the feet (e.g. walking long distances, running) may be contraindicated. Exercise therapy has been shown to increase the blood flow to the peripheral nerves, can improve gait function.

Heat, therapeutic ultrasound, hot wax are also useful for treating diabetic neuropathy. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can improve sexual dysfunction caused by neuropathy. Electric stimulation of the plantar aspect of the foot showed improved balance and sensation when performed daily.

=== Surgery ===
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) with superimposed nerve compression may be treatable in the limbs with multiple nerve decompressions. The theory behind this procedure is that DPN predisposes patients to nerve compression at anatomic areas of narrowing, and that a majority of symptoms of DPN are actually attributable to nerve entrapment, a treatable condition. Multiple systematic reviews have found that nerve decompression surgery for DPN is associated with lower pain scores, higher two-point discrimination (a measure of sensory improvement), lower rate of ulcerations, fewer falls (in the case of lower extremity decompression), and fewer amputations. Multiple nerve decompression surgery is unusual in that it can reverse some symptoms (e.g. lower pain and increased sensation), while also providing protection against serious foot complications (e.g. ulcers and amputations).

===Other===
Low-quality evidence supports a moderate-large beneficial effect of botulinum toxin injections. There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions for the utility of the cannabinoids nabilone and nabiximols.

==Prognosis==
The mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy are poorly understood. At present, treatment alleviates pain and can control some associated symptoms, but the process is generally progressive.

As a complication, there is an increased risk of injury to the feet because of loss of sensation (see diabetic foot). Small infections can progress to ulceration and this may require amputation.

==Epidemiology==
Globally diabetic neuropathy affects approximately 132 million people as of 2010 (1.9% of the population).

Diabetes is the leading known cause of neuropathy in developed countries, and neuropathy is the most common complication and greatest source of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. A systematic review has found that diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects 30% of diabetes patients. Diabetic neuropathy is implicated in 50–75% of nontraumatic amputations.

The main risk factor for diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia. In the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, 1995) study, the annual incidence of neuropathy was 2% per year but dropped to 0.56% with intensive treatment of Type 1 diabetics. The progression of neuropathy is dependent on the degree of glycemic control in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Duration of diabetes, age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, height, and hyperlipidemia are also risk factors for diabetic neuropathy.

<text>Galactosemia (British galactosaemia, from Greek γαλακτόζη + αίμα, meaning galactose + blood, accumulation of galactose in blood) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects an individual&#x27;s ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. Galactosemia follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that confers a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for adequate galactose degradation.

Friedrich Goppert (1870–1927), a German physician, first described the disease in 1917, with its cause as a defect in galactose metabolism being identified by a group led by Herman Kalckar in 1956. Galactosemia was the second disorder found to be detectable through newborn screening methods by Robert Guthrie.

Its incidence is about 1 per 60,000 births for people of European ancestry. In other populations the incidence rate differs. Galactosemia is about one hundred times more common (1:480 births) in the Irish Traveller population.

== Symptoms and signs==

=== Adults ===
Galactosemia is generally diagnosed in neonates after symptoms are shown or during routine newborn screening. However, there have been rare cases of undiagnosed galactosemia in adults, usually presenting with developmental delay in addition to numerous other symptoms.
Adults with galactosemia are at higher risk for cataracts (See: Galactosemic Cataract), with a prevalence of 1 in 5. Adults with galactosemia are at a much greater risk for an anxiety disorder (prevalence of 1 in 2, or 50 percent) and a slightly elevated risk of depression (prevalence of 3 in 25, or 12 percent). They may also suffer from ADHD, tremors, seizures or other neurological or psychological problems.

=== Infants ===
Infants may appear asymptomatic at birth; however, upon ingestion of galactose a few days later (via breast and/or formula feeding), children start to experience life-threatening symptoms, which include:
* poor feeding, and weight gain
* vomiting and diarrhea
* hepatocellular damage
* lethargy, and hypotonia

Progression of this acute neonatal toxicity syndrome may include the development of sepsis, cataracts, and even &quot;pseudotumor cerebri&quot; (which may cause a bulging of fontanelle).

=== Children ===

In children, untreated galactosemia can lead to cataracts, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, speech difficulties, fine and gross motor difficulties, kidney disease, liver failure, sepsis, and premature ovarian insufficiency. While a child is being treated for galactosemia, they may continue to experience speech delays, learning disabilities, behavioral issues, ataxia, tremors, and hormone deficiencies.

Lactose in food (such as dairy products) is broken down by the enzyme lactase into glucose and galactose. In individuals with galactosemia, the enzymes needed for further metabolism of galactose (Galactokinase and galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase) are severely diminished or missing entirely, leading to toxic levels of galactose or galactose 1-phosphate (depending on which enzyme is missing) in various tissues as in the case of classic galactosemia, resulting in hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), cirrhosis, kidney failure, cataracts, vomiting, seizure, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), lethargy, brain damage, and ovarian failure. Without treatment, mortality in infants with galactosemia is about 75%.

Galactosemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning a child must inherit one defective gene from each parent to show the disease. Heterozygotes are carriers, because they inherit one normal gene and one defective gene. Carriers show no symptoms of galactosemia.

==Accumulation of galactose==

===Reduction to galactitol===
In galactosemic patients, the accumulation of galactose becomes the substrate for enzymes that catalyze the polyol pathway of carbohydrate metabolism. The first reaction of this pathway is the reduction of aldoses, types of sugars including galactose, to sugar alcohols. Recent data suggests that aldose reductase is the enzyme responsible for the primary stage of this pathway. Therefore, aldose reductase reduces galactose to its sugar alcohol form, galactitol. Galactitol, however, is not a suitable substrate for the next enzyme in the polyol pathway, polyol dehydrogenase. Thus, galactitol accumulates in body tissues and is excreted in the urine of galactosemic patients. Many of the negative effects of galactosemia have been attributed to accumulation of galactitol, and high concentrations of galactitol have been found in people with classic galactosemia (GALT deficiency or galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency), galactokinase deficiency, and epimerase deficiency with glucose.

===Oxidation to galactonate===
Accumulated galactose can also undergo an alternative reaction: Oxidation to galactonate. The mechanism of galactonate formation is still unclear. However, recent studies suggest that galactose dehydrogenase is responsible for converting galactose to galactonolactone, which then spontaneously or enzymatically converts to galactonate. Once formed, galactonate may enter the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, oxidation to galactonate serves as an alternate pathway for metabolizing galactose. This oxidative pathway renders accumulated galactonate less harmful than accumulated galactitol.

== Diagnosis ==
In many states throughout the world, infants routinely undergo newborn screening (NBS) for galactosemia. This allows a diagnosis to be made while the person is still an infant. Affected children can have serious, irreversible effects or even die within days from birth. Infants affected by galactosemia typically present with symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and jaundice. None of these symptoms are specific to galactosemia, often leading to diagnostic delays. If the family of the baby has a history of galactosemia, doctors can test prior to birth by taking a sample of fluid from around the fetus (amniocentesis) or from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling or CVS). Galactosemia is normally first detected through newborn screening which if available, is able to diagnose the majority of affected infants.

A galactosemia test is a blood test (from the heel of the infant) or urine test that checks for three enzymes that are needed to change galactose sugar that is found in milk and milk products into glucose, a sugar that the human body uses for energy. A person with galactosemia does not have one of these enzymes. This causes high levels of galactose in the blood or urine.

Galactosemia can be detected through NBS before any ingestion of galactose-containing formula or breast milk. Detection of the disorder through NBS does not depend on protein or lactose ingestion, and, therefore, it should be identified on the first specimen unless the infant has been transfused. A specimen should be taken prior to transfusion. The enzyme is prone to damage if analysis of the sample is delayed or exposed to high temperatures. The routine NBS is accurate for detection of galactosemia. Two screening tests are used to screen infants affected with galactosemia—the Beutler&#x27;s test and the Hill test. The Beutler&#x27;s test screens for galactosemia by detecting the level of enzyme of the infant. Therefore, the ingestion of formula or breast milk does not affect the outcome of this part of the NBS, and the NBS is accurate for detecting galactosemia prior to any ingestion of galactose.

Duarte galactosemia is a milder form of classical galactosemia and usually has no long term side effects.

=== Types ===
Galactose is converted into glucose by the action of three enzymes, known as the Leloir pathway. There are diseases associated with deficiencies of each of these three enzymes:


== Treatment ==

The only treatment for classic galactosemia is eliminating lactose and galactose from the diet (e.g. exclusion of dairy products containing lactose).

Lactose-restricted diet is efficient in resolving acute complications; however, it is not sufficient to prevent long-term complications affecting the brain and female gonads. Some individuals may experience long-term complications such as speech difficulties, learning disabilities, neurological impairment (e.g. tremors, etc.), and ovarian failure.

Symptoms that have not been associated with Duarte galactosemia, and many individuals with Duarte galactosemia, do not need to restrict their diet at all. However, research corroborates a previously overlooked theory that Duarte galactosemia may lead to language developmental issues in children with no clinical symptoms. Infants with classic galactosemia cannot be breast-fed due to lactose in human breast milk which consists of both galactose and glucose and are usually fed a soy-based formula.

Galactosemia is sometimes confused with lactose intolerance, but galactosemia is a more serious condition. Lactose intolerant individuals have an acquired or inherited shortage of the enzyme lactase, and experience abdominal pains after ingesting dairy products, but no long-term effects. In contrast, a galactosemic individual who consumes galactose can have serious complications including:
* Speech deficits
* Ataxia
* Dysmetria
* Diminished bone density
* Premature ovarian failure
* Cataract

<doc id="515068" wikidata="Q6649122" url="?curid=515068" title="Little Birdy">
<text>Little Birdy was an Australian alternative rock band formed in Perth, Western Australia, in 2002 by singer and guitarist Katy Steele, drummer Matt Chequer, guitarist and keyboardist Simon Leach, and bass guitarist Scott O&#x27;Donoghue. They gained public attention when their single &quot;Relapse&quot; gained popularity on alternative radio stations such as Triple J, leading them to be signed by the record label . They released three studio albums (all three of which entered the top ten in the ARIA charts), two EPs, and ten singles.

== Early history ==
Katy Steele&#x27;s father Rick Steele is a local blues musician in various cover bands, and her brothers Jesse and Luke were both members of The Sleepy Jackson. Jesse left the band in 2000. Steele was the singer-songwriter and guitarist in her band, The Plastik Scene. A friend of Luke&#x27;s, Simon Leach, heard Steele singing at her brother&#x27;s 21st birthday party. &quot;Katy was always there... She was around 15 when I saw her sing. Three years later, Katy and I were playing together.&quot; Steele left her band and, with Leach as drummer, they performed several gigs as a duo. Scott (&#x27;Barney&#x27;) O&#x27;Donoghue later offered to play bass guitar. Leach became tired of percussion and began playing guitar when Matt Chequer joined on drums. In 2002 Little Birdy was formed, named after the Ween song of the same name.

A demo, leaked to radio, was played on alternative stations. A friend of the band dropped a copy at band manager Phil Stevens&#x27; home (manager of The Waifs, John Butler Trio and The Flairz). Stevens offered his management services. The band supported Placebo, Morcheeba, and The Superjesus in Perth concerts. A home recording of one of their songs won a WAMi Award for &quot;Indie-Alternative Song of the Year&quot;. Triple J, a national radio station, started playing an early version of &quot;Relapse&quot;, while local Perth radio station Nova 93.7 aired a demo of &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. As a result of independent media coverage and radio playing demos, Australian labels sought to sign the band. Little Birdy opted for the independent label with distribution through Virgin Records-EMI. Steele, along with Leach, who was a graphic designer, quit their jobs and became full-time musicians after the signing.

== Recording career ==
Little Birdy released their self-titled debut EP &quot;Little Birdy&quot; in October 2003, which peaked at No. 27 on the ARIA Singles Chart. &quot;Relapse&quot; reached No. 16 on the Triple J Hottest 100 and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; attained No. 25. In September, Steele, in an interview on Whammo.com.au, described the band&#x27;s progress: &quot;I think we&#x27;ve already written a lot of the first album already. A lot of songs we play live would be awesome if they were recorded&quot;. The band played gigs in London and New York City later that year, with interest from international record companies.

Their second EP, &quot;This Is a Love Song&quot;, was issued in March 2004 and debuted at No. 22. Also in that month, Steele won the inaugural Jessica Michalik Contemporary Music Award, presented by The Big Day Out. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, &quot;Relapse&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Breakthrough Artist - Single&#x27;.

In October, the band released their debut album, &quot;BigBigLove&quot;, which was produced and engineered by Paul McKercher (The Cruel Sea, Spiderbait, Augie March) and peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It contains new versions of &quot;Beautiful&quot; (renamed &quot;Beautiful to Me&quot;) and &quot;Relapse&quot;, and includes &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Known&quot; with its original title of &quot;Andy Warhol&quot;. The album received generally positive critical reviews. Two tracks reached the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2004, &quot;Beautiful to Me&quot; at No. 8 and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; at No. 78. Another track, &quot;This Is a Love Song&quot;, taken from their &quot;This Is a Love Song&quot;, attained No. 40.

In 2005, at the WAMi Awards, Steele won &#x27;Best Female Vocalist&#x27; and &quot;Beautiful to Me&quot; won &#x27;Most Popular Music Video&#x27;. Additional nominations were, Leach for &#x27;Best Guitarist&#x27;, the band for &#x27;Best Popular Act&#x27;, &#x27;Most Popular Commercial Pop Act&#x27; and &#x27;Best Indie/Pop Act&#x27;, and &quot;BigBigLove&quot; as &#x27;Most Popular Album&#x27;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2005, &quot;BigBigLove&quot; was nominated in four categories: &#x27;Breakthrough Artist - Album&#x27;, &#x27;Best Rock Album&#x27;, &#x27;Producer of the Year&quot; (McKercher), and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27; (McKercher). Also that year, Little Birdy&#x27;s version of &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot; from the tribute album, &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot;, of Neil and Tim Finn songs performed by female Australian and New Zealand musicians, reached No. 96 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of 2005.

During 2006, the band recorded tracks for their second album, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, which peaked at No. 9 in October. The first single was &quot;Come on Come on&quot;, in September, which reached No. 18 – the group&#x27;s highest-charting single to date. It was placed 11th on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006.

In 2008, the band relocated to Melbourne and started recording a third album, &quot;Confetti&quot;, which they released in May 2009 and peaked at No. 6. A website was created for previews of new recordings and videos of studio sessions. The album was self-produced and the band worked with engineer-mixer Steven Schram. It was nominated for &#x27;Best Adult Contemporary Album&#x27; and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27; (Schram) at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009. In February, they issued a music video for the first song, &quot;Brother&quot;. The song features Paul Kelly on backing vocals and harmonica.

&quot;Confetti&quot;&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Summarize&quot;, was released in April, it was followed by &quot;Hairdo&quot; and &quot;Stay Wild&quot;. In February 2010, Chequer announced on the band&#x27;s website that Steele moved to New York and expected to work on her debut solo album, Leach was working on solo material, O&#x27;Donoghue was working with other bands, and Chequer himself was doing production work. Steele trialled some solo material at four Australian concerts in May.

== Touring ==
Little Birdy undertook its own concerts throughout Australia in 2004 and 2005. They supported R.E.M. during the Australian leg of their world tour in 2005. Little Birdy appeared at national festivals in 2007, including Falls Festival, Big Day Out, Sonic Bloom Festival, Southbound (in Busselton, Western Australia), and Great Escape Festival (Sydney).

Little Birdy appeared at Sound Relief at the Sydney Cricket Ground in March 2009, which was a benefit concert for victims of Victorian bush fires and Queensland floods.

<text>Destination Games was an American computer game development company created in April 2000 by Richard Garriott, Robert Garriott and Starr Long, following their departure from Origin Systems. (&quot;Destination&quot; is a play on &quot;Origin&quot;, the company the Garriotts founded nearly two decades earlier.)

Destination was founded in Austin, Texas to develop massively multiplayer online role-playing games. At E3 2001, Richard Garriott announced a partnership making Destination the United States headquarters of South Korean MMORPG giant NCSOFT. As NCSOFT Austin, Destination has mainly focused on developing and supporting the North American version of NCSOFT&#x27;s &quot;Lineage&quot; games.

In 2007 Destination Games released its first game, &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, a sci-fi MMORPG. The game did not sell as well as was hoped, Richard Garriott left NCSOFT in 2008, and the game service closed in February 2009. The Destination Games website was taken down when NCsoft moved its United States headquarters from Austin to Seattle—calling it NCSOFT West—in 2008.

NCSOFT Austin employed five people to run the casual MMOG &quot;Dungeon Runners&quot;, but announced in 2009 that support for this game will be ending in early 2010 due to low subscription numbers. As of October 2009, NCSOFT employs about 150 people in the former Destination Games office in Austin mainly working in server operations, quality assurance, and customer support for various NCSOFT MMO titles, however development operations have moved completely to other NCSSOFT subsidiaries on the West Coast. The trademark &quot;Destination Games&quot; remains a property of NCSOFT.

<text>A besom () is a broom, a household implement used for sweeping. The term is mostly reserved for a traditional broom constructed from a bundle of twigs tied to a stout pole. The twigs used could be broom (i.e. &quot;Genista&quot;, from which comes the modern name &quot;broom&quot; for the tool), heather or similar. The song &quot;Buy Broom Buzzems&quot; from Northern England refers to both types of twig. From the phrase &quot;broom besom&quot; the more common &quot;broom&quot; comes. In Scotland and Bulgaria, besoms are still occasionally to be found at the edge of forests where they are stacked for use in early response to an outbreak of fire.

==Description==
As a result of its construction around a central pole, the brush of the besom is rounded instead of flat. The bristles can be made of many materials including, but not limited to straw, herbs, or twigs. Traditionally, the handle is of hazel wood and the head is of birch twigs. Modern construction uses bindings of wire and string (instead of the traditional split withy) and the head is secured by a steel nail instead of a wooden dowel.

==Cultural associations==

===Besoms and flying ointments in early modern witchcraft===


A number of different recipes for &quot;flying ointments&quot; have survived from the early modern period, some of the constituents of which not only have hallucinogenic properties but are fat-soluble and could have been absorbed transdermally. Certain researchers have speculated that the stereotypical image of the witch &quot;flying&quot; astride the broomstick of a besom may derive from traditions concerning the use of broomsticks or other staves by women to apply psychotropic ointments to their vaginal or anal mucosa. The active ingredients in flying ointments were primarily plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae, most commonly &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot; (deadly nightshade) and &quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot; (henbane), belonging to the tropane alkaloid-rich tribe Hyoscyameae. Other tropane-containing, nightshade ingredients included the famous mandrake (&quot;Mandragora officinarum&quot;), &quot;Scopolia carniolica&quot; and &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;, the thornapple.
The alkaloids atropine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine present in these solanaceous plants are not only potent (and highly toxic) hallucinogens of the deliriant class, but are also fat-soluble and capable of being absorbed through unbroken human skin.
Another ingredient listed frequently in the various flying ointment recipes is the even more toxic &quot;Aconitum napellus&quot;, which has (among others) the English common name &quot;wolfsbane&quot; (i.e. &quot;slayer of wolves&quot;).

===In Russia and Ukraine===

In Russian culture, the besom or &quot;venik&quot; () has historically had both good and bad connotations. It was seen as a place behind or under which a domovoy would hide, and similarly to the broom it was sometimes associated with the occult. However, it also sometimes served as a protective amulet, as well as a tool for fortune-telling. A venik was also often not thrown away, instead being ceremonially burned during Maslenitsa. The venik&#x27;s cultural significance extends outside Russia: in Odesa Oblast, Ukraine, a large venik statue (six metres tall) was erected to commemorate the 620th anniversary of the foundation of Savran, a settlement in the area, which was recognized as the largest venik monument in the world.

<text>Circus Oz is a contemporary circus company based in Australia, collectively owned by its Membership, founded in 1978. Its shows incorporate theatre, satire, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and a uniquely Australian humour.

==History==
===Early years===
Circus Oz received the Certificate of Incorporation of Public Company on the February 9th 1978 in Melbourne and funded by the Australian Performing Group, with its first performance season in March 1978. Circus Oz was the amalgamation of two already well-known groups: the New Ensemble Circus (a continuation of the New Circus, established in Adelaide in 1973); and the Soapbox Circus, a roadshow set up by the Australian Performing Group in 1976.

The founding members were: Sue Broadway, Tony Burkys, Tim Coldwell, John ‘Jack’ Daniel, Laurel Frank, Kelvin Gedye, Jon Hawkes, Ponch Hawkes, Robin Laurie, John Pinder, Michael Price, Alan Robertson, Jim Robertson, Pixie Roberstson, Helen Sky, Jim Conway, Mic Conway, Rick Ludbrook, Peter Mulheisen, Gordon McLean, Steve Cooney and Colin Stevens.

Significant developments in Circus Oz&#x27;s early years included: a 32-week season in 1979 at the Last Laugh Theatre Restaurant in Melbourne; the company&#x27;s first international tour in 1980 (including London&#x27;s Roundhouse, Belgium and New Guinea); the &quot;Nanjing Project&quot; (Chinese acrobatic master classes); and the group&#x27;s relations with The Flying Fruit Fly Circus. As part of its international touring, Circus Oz has been to 29 countries and 210 cities all over the world, including New York City, London and Jerusalem.

Originally founded as a collective governed company, Circus Oz developed into a triumvirate by the late 1990s by having a Triple Executive who all equally ran and organised the company. The Triple Executive included Co-CEO Linda Mickleborough who became general manager of Circus Oz in 1993. During her time at the helm she was responsible for the development of Circus Oz Classes, High Flying Teams and Indigenous programs, and laid the preparations for a move to new premises at Collingwood. She resigned effective from 31 December 2012. The Executive team also included Co-CEO Mike Finch who was artistic director (1997-2015), and founding member Tim Coldwell. The company is owned by the Company Membership (the stakeholders) and is governed by a Board of Directors. Chairs of the Board have included: Trish Caswell; Vic Marles; and Wendy McCarthy.

==The company==
===Values===
The founders wanted to create a &quot;contemporary circus&quot; (words used in their show programme &quot;history&quot; as early as 1980), with elements of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, popular theatre and satire. The company had an ongoing social justice agenda and was open about supporting humanitarian causes. Over the years this has included women&#x27;s rights, land rights for indigenous Australians and strong feelings about the plight of asylum seekers. The company had an ongoing social justice agenda and have generally been open about supporting humanist causes. Over the years this has included women&#x27;s rights, land rights for First Nations Australians and strong opposition to the indefinite detention of asylum seekers.

===Shows===
One of the first &quot;new&quot; or &quot;contemporary&quot; circuses without animals (it predates Cirque du Soleil by several years), Circus Oz made shows with only 12 multi-skilled performers who all performed the entire show, doing &quot;a bit of everything&quot;, from acrobatics and clowning to music and aerial work. The shows were usually comic and character-driven. The cast comprised a diverse mix of body shapes and ages, with an equal number of men and women. Their style was generally cheeky, anarchic and subversive.

Circus Oz performed in at least 27 countries across five continents, including four seasons on 42nd Street in New York City, a number of seasons at Queen Elizabeth and Royal Festival Halls in London, a refugee camp in the West Bank, Indigenous communities in the Australian desert and a glass opera house in the Brazilian rainforest. Shows were translated and performed in many languages, including Hindi, Catalan and Danish. The troupe broke box office records at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and represented Australia at many international festivals.

With the exception of &quot;Waiter, There&#x27;s a Circus in My Soup&quot; (1979), Circus Oz did not name their seasons or tours until 2006, with the &quot;Laughing at Gravity&quot; tour. Each subsequent tour was then named until 2017 when Artistic Director, Rob Tannion (AD from 2016-2019), developed the company into a multi-show model.

===Ensemble===
Until 2017, the company employed a full-time ensemble of 12 performers (an equal number of men and women), plus a technical crew, production and artistic departments. Apart from touring nationally and internationally with their various shows, other parts of Circus Oz included:

*BLAKFlip, a programme connecting Australian Aboriginal performers and artists with the circus, including masterclasses, casting, performances, traineeships and guest artists;
*Circus Classes, public circus classes for the general public, adults, schools, and community groups to learn circus skills; 
*The Melba Spiegeltent, a venue with a programme of cabaret, innovative performance, and local community events;
*SideSault, a Sector Support Programme, providing access to space for a selected series of small/medium-sized local performance groups (primarily using a circus vocabulary);
*High Flying Teams, a corporate team-building and training programme using circus as a skill-base for corporate training

==Notable Events==
===&quot;New&quot; premises===
In late 2013 Circus Oz relocated to a new custom-built home base in Collingwood, an inner suburb of Melbourne. The Victorian Government owns the facility, but was designed specifically to Circus Oz&#x27;s requirements. This location includes a permanent Spiegeltent, large rehearsal spaces, outdoor areas, and workshop and props-making facilities. The buildings are approximately half of an abandoned college campus, the remainder of which was converted by Arts Victoria into a multi-arts and community precinct known as Collingwood Yards, which opened in March 2021.

===The closure that never came ===
In December 2021, it was announced by the Board and CEO at the time that a decision had been taken to close the company, after its main funding body the Australia Council had given the choice of reforming its structure or losing its funding. The proposal involved recreating its board and membership with a reduced proportion of artists and former employees (a move that would be fundamentally against the company&#x27;s ethos). The results of an anonymous online poll showed that 62 out of 81 votes chose to reject the new model. During 2021, the company had been the subject of an independent review, commissioned jointly by Creative Victoria and the Australia Council, which had concluded that &quot;systemic issues [were] holding back the company&quot;, and recommended that membership criteria be broadened that the board should be made up entirely of members based on their skills and qualifications. Company members were shocked by the sudden announcement. , their website announced a change of use for the Circus Oz venue. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on Wednesday 16th February 2022, the members voted unanimously to continue the operations of the company regardless of the implications for funding, and accept the resignations of the then Board members.

<doc id="515090" wikidata="Q2762009" url="?curid=515090" title="The Infinity Gauntlet">
<text>The Infinity Gauntlet is an American comic book storyline published by Marvel Comics. In addition to an eponymous, six-issue limited series written by Jim Starlin and pencilled by George Pérez and Ron Lim, crossover chapters appeared in related comic books. Since its initial serialization from July to December 1991, the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions.

The series&#x27; events are driven by Thanos, a nihilist character created for Marvel by Starlin in 1973. When Starlin began writing &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; in 1990, he and Lim began a new plot with Thanos that developed over sixteen monthly issues and a spin-off limited series before concluding in &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. Pérez was brought in to draw &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; because he had more name recognition among fans and because Lim already had a full schedule. However, after completing three issues and part of the fourth, his own busy schedule and dissatisfaction with the story led to him being replaced by Lim.

At the start of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, the character Thanos has collected all six Infinity Gems and attached them to his gauntlet. With their combined power, he becomes &quot;like a god&quot; and sets out to win the affection of Mistress Death, the living embodiment of death in the Marvel Universe. When Thanos uses his powers to instantly erase half of the life in the universe from existence, Adam Warlock leads Earth&#x27;s remaining heroes against him. After the Infinity Gauntlet is stolen by Thanos&#x27; villainous granddaughter Nebula, Thanos aids the remaining heroes in defeating her.

The series was a top seller for Marvel during publication and was followed by two immediate sequels, &quot;The Infinity War&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot; (1993). The story&#x27;s events continued to be referenced in other Marvel comics for decades. &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; remained popular among fans, warranting multiple reprint editions and merchandise, with its themes and plot elements adapted into video games and animated cartoons. Most notable among later adaptations was the &quot;Infinity Saga&quot; of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which incorporated elements of the original comic story into a saga that spanned across almost two dozen connected films.

==Publication history==
===Background===
Artist and character creator Jim Starlin introduced Thanos, the antagonist for the storyline, in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #55 (Feb. 1973). After providing artwork for &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; #24-25 (Jan. 1973 &amp; March 1973), Starlin co-wrote #26 (May 1973) with Mike Friedrich, which featured Thanos (albeit in shadow) on a Marvel cover for the first time and marked the beginning of what was later coined the &quot;First Thanos War&quot;. After collaborating with Friedrich for #27-28 (July &amp; Sept. 1973), Starlin then assumed sole writing duties for the remainder of the sweeping cosmic saga from #29-33 (Nov. 1973 - July 1974). Starlin completed one final issue, #34 (Sept. 1974), laying the groundwork for the eventual death of hero Mar-Vell before leaving the title.

In 1975, Starlin began writing and illustrating &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, in which he made significant changes to Adam Warlock and developed the concept of the Infinity Gems. He reintroduced Thanos first as Warlock&#x27;s ally, then as his opponent in a storyline known as the &quot;Second Thanos War&quot; that ran until 1977. Because of their close publications dates, the two Thanos Wars are sometimes considered to be one storyline. Both are considered &quot;cosmic&quot; stories and led to Starlin being known as a &quot;cosmic&quot; writer.

Starlin stopped doing regular work for Marvel after concluding the Second Thanos War, but occasionally returned for short projects like &quot;The Death of Captain Marvel&quot; graphic novel and creator-owned work such as the cosmic-themed &quot;Dreadstar&quot; through the 1980s. He also did high-profile work for DC Comics, such as &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot;. In a 1990 interview, Starlin described himself as the only writer who had been allowed to &quot;play&quot; with Thanos, although other writers had scripted some tie-in chapters of the First Thanos War.

Artist George Pérez was known for drawing comics featuring large casts. He came to prominence in the 1970s while working on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot; before leaving the company to work for DC on comics such as &quot;New Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. In 1984, Pérez entered into an exclusive contract with DC.

===Development===

In 1988, Steve Englehart was writing &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; and one of his storylines involved the Infinity Gems and Mistress Death. He asked to do a follow-up story in which Mistress Death uses Thanos to get revenge on her enemies, but editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco did not know who Thanos was. After the character was explained to him, DeFalco liked the idea so much he wanted to save it for a big summer crossover instead. At the time, he indicated he wanted to format it like &quot;The Evolutionary War&quot;, a 1988 crossover spread across the annuals of several continuing series instead of being contained in a limited series.

Because of his ties to Thanos, Starlin was invited back to Marvel to write the story. He returned because work for him at DC declined following his controversial &quot;Batman&quot; story &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; (1988). Inspired by the work he had recently read from Wilhelm Reich, Carlos Castaneda, and Roger Zelazny, Starlin wanted to purposely add multiple layers to his characters instead of letting them be one-dimensional. He started writing with the expectation that this would be the last Thanos story &quot;at least for a while&quot; and was midway through the story before deciding to make Thanos an antihero. He began writing &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; with #34, cover dated February 1990. To organize various plot and character points, Starlin made notes on 3-by-5 cards and pinned them to a large piece of plywood hung on his wall.

His first four issues reintroduced Thanos and was seen as the first act of the new Thanos storyline. Initially, Starlin and editor Craig Anderson planned for the story to remain contained within the pages of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;. However, Marvel had recently been purchased and the new owners mandated all intellectual property be exploited to maximum potential. To capitalize on the excitement surrounding Thanos&#x27; return, the start of the second act was spun off into the two-issue limited series &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot;, released in September–October 1990. The plot then continued in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; beginning with #44. In &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #46, Starlin reintroduced Adam Warlock and his supporting cast. He included these characters because the editors told him a different writer wanted to use them, and they would let him unless Starlin wanted to use them first. Starlin was not impressed by the other writer&#x27;s work, so he wrote Warlock into his &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; story. Again, Starlin and Anderson planned to conclude the story in the pages of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, but the sales of &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot; were high enough to warrant another spin-off. After &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #50, the plot moved to &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. Because of the time required to write the double-length issues of the limited series and coordinate tie-ins, Starlin had to leave the &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; series at #52.

The editorial staff did not oppose Starlin&#x27;s plans to kill major characters, which he believes was partly because Anderson did not share many of the details with his peers. They did, however, limit which of &quot;their&quot; characters could have roles in the story. For example, X-Men editor Bob Harras only allowed Cyclops and Wolverine to appear. The rest of the X-Men cast were said to have died off-panel or were otherwise omitted. This hesitancy was due in part to the relative newness of summer crossover events.
Early in 1990, Marvel writer/artist Jim Valentino learned Pérez&#x27;s contract with DC Comics was going to lapse in August. He contacted Pérez by phone to see if he would ink a cover to &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, a comic Valentino was currently writing and penciling. Pérez agreed, and Valentino told Anderson, who was his editor as well. Anderson passed the information to Starlin, who called Pérez and asked him to pencil &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. After working out the terms with Starlin and Anderson, Pérez agreed to the job. In a 1991 interview, Pérez speculated that he was asked because &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; and &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot; penciller Ron Lim was too busy.

Although Pérez had been a writer as well as an artist at DC, he agreed to work from full scripts on &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; because he was not familiar with the current state of Marvel&#x27;s characters. From the start, Pérez found this to be &quot;a little aggravating, unnerving&quot; because of the limits it placed on him. Starlin gave Pérez a suggested layout with each script to use as a reference, but Pérez ignored them with Starlin&#x27;s blessing. He exercised this freedom by giving some scenes more space, even moving some scenes to different pages. Early in the collaboration, he asked Starlin to increase the number of characters appearing in the story so his return to Marvel would &quot;knock fans&#x27; socks off&quot;.

Before he had finished the interior art for the first issue, Pérez completed the pencils for the covers of the first four issues so they could be used as promotional material. Some characters however, like Thor and Quasar, were wearing outdated costumes on the cover of issue three and had to be redrawn, which frustrated Pérez. Starlin, who wrote the scripts months in advance, also had to make minor adjustments to account for changes in these characters and the Hulk.

During production, Pérez was also pencilling &quot;War of the Gods&quot; for DC Comics, a Wonder Woman miniseries he described as a &quot;highly stressful&quot; project. When he began to fall behind schedule on both projects, he wanted to quit &quot;War of the Gods&quot; but was contractually bound to complete it. Partly because of this stress and partly because he had become used to writing as well as drawing, he became overly critical of Starlin&#x27;s scripts for &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. Specifically, he felt Starlin&#x27;s story could be told in fewer pages. His lack of enthusiasm caused him to work slower, and he began to fall further behind schedule. In a 1994 interview, Starlin claimed Pérez was also acting at the time, and that it was a bigger contributor to the scheduling problems than the comic workload.

When it became clear Pérez would not be able to meet the deadline for the fourth issue, DeFalco asked regular &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; penciler Ron Lim to complete issue #4. DeFalco suggested to Pérez that he let Lim finish the rest of the series, and Pérez agreed. Pérez understood the decision, and later said he felt Lim should have been the artist from the beginning. He inked Lim&#x27;s covers for the remainder of the series to show he bore no ill will to the change. Although Marvel&#x27;s management had feared sales would fall with Pérez&#x27;s departure, sales rose with each issue Lim penciled.

To replace Pérez, Lim had to leave his regular work on the monthly &quot;Captain America&quot; title. He cites Pérez as an influence and found it &quot;nerve-wracking&quot; to supplant him. Furthermore, the large cast made it the most challenging book he had done at that point in his career. Still, he said it was &quot;fun&quot; to work on the design aspect of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;.

When he saw sales figures for &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, Pérez realized he probably lost &quot;tens of thousands of dollars&quot; in royalty payments by leaving the series, but he was glad he left when he learned a sequel was in development. Like Starlin, Pérez had begun the project believing it would be the last Thanos story, but management asked Starlin to write a sequel midway through &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. By then, Starlin had already conceived follow-up concepts and knew it would be a trilogy.

===Publication===
Marvel&#x27;s marketing department &quot;mega-hyped&quot; the event in the months leading up to its release according to journalist Sean Howe. One aspect of the promotion was sending direct market retailers a kit that included a letter explaining details of the series, a sign to put by their cash register, and a poster 18 inches wide by 36 inches tall. Marvel&#x27;s promotional magazine &quot;Marvel Age&quot; featured a cover story on &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot; and a Starlin interview in issue #91 (August 1990), followed by a 7-page preview of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1 in &quot;Marvel Age&quot; #99 (April 1991). The limited series was the cover feature on &quot;Comics Interview&quot; #94 in March 1991, which included an 8-page interview with Pérez, and Starlin was interviewed about the series in &quot;Comics Scene&quot; #19 in June 1991.

Marvel initially planned to release a new issue every two weeks, but deadline problems caused it to be released monthly. Issues had cover dates between July and December 1991. Each one was available in both comic specialty stores and newsstand outlets, which included supermarkets and department stores. Although the cover artwork was identical, the edition sold in comic stores featured additional artwork celebrating Marvel&#x27;s 30th anniversary in place of the barcode found on the newsstand edition. Each issue was 48 pages and cover priced at $2.50 at a time when the average Marvel comic was $1.00 and 24 pages.

===Tie-ins===

To emphasize the connected nature of Marvel&#x27;s comic books, some ongoing series starring characters seen in &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; had contemporary issues showing the main plot from a different point of view or explored consequences of certain events. These issues featured a triangle in the top right corner of their covers with the text &quot;An Infinity Gauntlet Crossover&quot;. These tie-in issues did not impact the plot of the limited series and could be skipped by readers without creating plot holes. &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #36 was set after the events of the crossover and featured a triangle with the text &quot;An Infinity Gauntlet Epilogue&quot;.

Unlike other crossovers such as &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; (the competing 1991 crossover from DC Comics) which featured tie-ins from a large majority of their publisher&#x27;s comics, &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; only had tie-ins from titles which were obviously connected to the event or from series which needed a boost in sales. According to Pérez, Marvel&#x27;s stance toward the tie-ins for its low-selling titles was &quot;do it or else&quot;. Starlin remained uninvolved, allowing writers to choose for themselves which story elements they wished to use.

===Collected editions and reprints===
The miniseries was collected in a single softcover edition released in 1992, a time when publishers only collected popular storylines, to coincide with the release of &quot;The Infinity War&quot;. It featured new cover artwork by Pérez and was enhanced with a foil logo. Later printings of this edition had alternate cover artwork from different artists and no enhancement. The suggested retail price was $19.95, five dollars more than the total retail cost of the individual issues it contained.

In June 2006, Marvel issued a second softcover collected edition to coincide with Keith Giffen and Andrea Di Vito&#x27;s &quot;Annihilation&quot;, another cosmic-level crossover starring Thanos and the Silver Surfer. This edition used the cover art from issue #1 and had a trade dress matching the first edition collections of &quot;The Infinity War&quot; and &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot; which were released shortly thereafter. The month of release, it sold approximately 2,500 copies and was the 33rd best-selling comic collection according to Diamond Distribution. Marvel also released a &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; collection subtitled &quot;The Rebirth of Thanos&quot; in 2006 which included four of the lead-in issues of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; and both issues of &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot;.

A hardcover edition was released in July 2010 as the 46th entry in the &quot;Marvel Premiere Classic&quot; line. Like other volumes in this line, it was available with two covers. The standard cover featured a cutout of Thanos from the cover of issue #4 on a black matte background with the title in metallic red ink. The variant cover, available only to comic specialty stores, featured the cover art for issue #1 reduced 50% against a black and red background. The variant edition identifies itself as #46 on its spine.

In 2011, a third edition softcover was released. The first printing reused the artwork from the standard cover of the &quot;Premiere Classic&quot; edition. Later printings reverted to the cover of issue #1. Sales of the collection spiked after Thanos appeared in a post-credits scene of the 2012 film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, causing &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; to be the highest selling graphic novel in 2018.

In July 2014, Marvel released a 1,248 page omnibus edition of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. In addition to the limited series, the hardcover also included the lead-up issues of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot;, and the marketed tie-ins. It also included additional issues of &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Quasar&quot;, &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; which had not been advertised as tie-ins, but were connected to the story. Comic book stores and the book market both offered a regular edition featuring the cover to &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1, but comic shops could also order a variant edition with cover art by Starlin.

The first issue of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; was included in the initial wave of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;True Believers&quot; line in April 2015. Consisting solely of reprints offered at a discount price, comic books in this line are meant to introduce newer readers to the most popular titles in Marvel&#x27;s history. A new printing was paired with a &quot;True Believers&quot; reprint of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #34 in April 2018.

In March 2018, Marvel released an &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; slipcase set of 12 hardcover books. Material began with &quot;Infinity Gauntlet Prologue&quot; and included all three &quot;Infinity&quot; crossovers, their tie-ins, intervening material, and a 528-page &quot;companion&quot; hardcover. The &quot;Infinity Gauntlet Prologue&quot; was released independently of the set at the same time.

A deluxe paperback was released in February 2019. It contained the miniseries and additional content discussing the creation of the series.

==Plot==
Resurrected by Mistress Death to correct a perceived imbalance between life and death, the Mad Titan Thanos first encounters the Silver Surfer, and subsequently fakes his own death to proceed without interference. Thanos decides to reacquire the six Infinity Gems that he had previously used as a simple weapon. After defeating several of the Elders of the Universe and the In-Betweener, Thanos regains the gems and now has control over the six aspects of existence: Time, Space, Mind, Soul, Reality and Power. Ironically, now that Thanos is in possession of his &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, Death must advise him via an intermediary - she cannot speak directly to him as he is now her superior.

When the Silver Surfer learns that Thanos is still alive and confronts him, Thanos traps the Silver Surfer&#x27;s soul inside the Soul Gem. On &quot;Soul World&quot;, the Silver Surfer encounters former enemy of Thanos, Adam Warlock. Warlock returns the Surfer to his body and promises to help defeat Thanos. The Surfer races to Earth to warn super-team the Avengers about the coming threat. Demonic entity Mephisto senses the power in the Infinity Gauntlet and offers to instruct Thanos in its use, while secretly waiting for an opportunity to steal it for himself.

Angry at Mistress Death&#x27;s rejection, Thanos creates a shrine in her image, and then traps and burns Nebula – who pretended to be his &quot;grand-daughter&quot; – as an offering. When still rejected, Thanos in a fit of rage destroys several stars and then remembers the reason Mistress Death wanted him. With only the snap of his fingers, Thanos eliminates half of all living beings in the universe. The Surfer warns Doctor Strange about Thanos and encourages him to summon Earth&#x27;s heroes. Cosmic entities Galactus and Epoch seek the source of the sudden imbalance, while Warlock and companions Gamora and Pip the Troll leave Soul World and occupy recently dead humans on Earth, reviving and altering the bodies to match their former appearance. Warlock appears before Doctor Strange and claims Thanos can only be defeated if Earth&#x27;s remaining heroes unite under his command.

Warlock meets with a group of cosmic entities, who, despite the reluctance and withdrawal of the Living Tribunal and Eternity, agree to attack Thanos. The combined heroes attack while Warlock and the Surfer observe, with Thanos almost defeated after heeding Mephisto&#x27;s advice to limit his power to demonstrate his devotion to Death, until Doctor Doom, a part of the team working against Thanos, arrogantly tries and fails to steal the gauntlet, to which Thanos then knocks Doom throughout all of space and kills most of the heroes.

After the heroes fail, the cosmic entities attack, with Mephisto and Mistress Death also joining in the assault on Thanos. Thanos, however, traps all the entities in stasis and changes the shrine to feature himself instead of Mistress Death. Believing he has defeated all of his enemies, Thanos separates his consciousness from his body and assumes an astral form taking the place of Eternity. Nebula uses this opportunity to steal the now-discarded Infinity Gauntlet. After restoring herself, Nebula banishes Thanos to drift through interstellar space, but he is rescued and brought to Earth by Doctor Strange. Warlock advises Thanos that whilst in Soul World he was able to examine the Titan&#x27;s soul. Courtesy of his bond with the Soul Gem, Warlock knew Thanos would eventually lose the Infinity Gauntlet because, at his core, Thanos felt himself unworthy of the power. Overwhelmed by this revelation, Thanos agrees to help Warlock, Doctor Strange, and the Silver Surfer oppose Nebula.

Thanos tricks Nebula into restoring the universe to its prior condition, inadvertently reverting into a burn victim in the process. Nebula wills herself back to health before Thanos can retrieve the gauntlet, but during this distraction Warlock returns to Soul World and uses his connection to the gem to create disharmony between the other gems. This causes Nebula to remove the gauntlet, which an emerging Warlock claims for himself. Preferring death to imprisonment, Thanos apparently dies in a suicide bomb blast. The heroes have reservations about Warlock keeping the gauntlet, but he returns them to Earth. Warlock then travels 60 days into the future to visit an unnamed planet where Thanos is living as a farmer. Thanos advises Warlock he has given up his quest for power and plans to lead a quiet, introspective life.

==Reception==
===At release===
&quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; was an instant success and became one of the most influential storylines in comics from the 1990s. Both of the nationwide comic distributors at the time (Diamond Distribution and Capital City Distribution) reported each issue was one of their top ten sellers for the month of its release. When Capital City released their top 100 best selling single issues of 1991, &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; issues fell between the 42nd and 64th positions. Aside from the first issue of &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot;, all of the higher ranked entries were issues of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Robin II: The Joker&#x27;s Wild!&quot;, or the X-Men franchise. &quot;Wizard&quot;, a comic magazine known for embracing speculation in the comic market, listed &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1 as the ninth &quot;Hottest Book&quot; in September 1991, and two lead-in issues of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; were ranked sixth and tenth. The first issue&#x27;s resale value rose above its $2.50 cover price in the back issue market, plateauing around $9 or $10 in late 1992.

The debut issue of the follow-up series, &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot;, was the top recommendation from &quot;Wizard&quot; for December 1991. It led directly into the first sequel, &quot;The Infinity War&quot;, which began in June 1992. The next sequel, &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot;, began in June 1993. The tie-ins to &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; also sold well, leading the editors who had put limits on characters appearing in &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; to request their books tie in to its sequels. Although both sequels sold well, they were viewed by critics like &quot;Wizard&quot;″s Pat McCallum as being motivated by sales rather than storytelling because of their excessive tie-ins and slow narratives.

===In later years===
By the end of the decade, interest in the continuing story dwindled, with sequels poorly received by fans, and &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; canceled in 1995. The same year, Marvel moved the Infinity Gems from their main continuity to an alternate universe called the Ultraverse, a property Marvel acquired when it bought Malibu Comics. The Ultraverse comics were then canceled in 1996. By 1998, &quot;Wizard&quot; was no longer listing &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; in its monthly price guide. The first edition of the paperback collection saw its last printing in 1999.

The iconography of the gauntlet remained popular, however. When Marvel partnered with fellow Disney subsidiary ESPN to create promotional images for the 2010–11 NBA season, the October 22, 2010 issue of &quot;&quot; included an advertisement showing Kobe Bryant wearing the gauntlet. When IGN released an unranked list of the all-time best comic book events in 2011, &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; was included and was noted for being &quot;a template on which all future cosmic events were based&quot;. Its lasting appeal is often attributed to Pérez&#x27;s artwork and Starlin&#x27;s unusual treatment of classic heroes.

When Thanos made a cameo appearance in the 2012 film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, there was renewed interest in &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. This was further heightened in October 2014 when the title of the third and fourth &quot;Avengers&quot; films were revealed to be &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. As the 2018 release of &quot;Infinity War&quot; neared, several comic news websites produced articles explaining the storyline and speculating on which elements would be included in the adaptation. The renewed attention from the films made the paperback collection of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; the best-selling graphic novel in 2018.

Not all evaluations were positive – in a 2013 review for &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, Drew Bradley felt the story was &quot;only great&quot; if read in its entirety. At the time of his article, the collected edition of Act One was out of print, with much of Act Two not been reprinted in any form. Bradley felt the story would not live up to its hype if readers skipped the lead-in material. Writing for &quot;Digital Spy&quot;, Hugh Armitage complained about the comic&#x27;s lack of real consequences, calling it &quot;essentially [...] a really bizarre love story&quot;.

===Legacy in comics===
Aside from its immediate spin-off and sequels, the events of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; have impacted storylines in later comics, including &quot;Thanos&quot; in 2003, &quot;Avengers&quot; (vol. 4) in 2011, and &quot;Secret Wars&quot; in 2016. Several of these later stories have downplayed the power of the gauntlet, often showing someone possessing it being beaten by a more powerful opponent.

The storyline from &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; has been revisited by other comic books in the years since its release. The series &quot;What If...?&quot;, which explores alternate outcomes to important events in the Marvel Universe, featured several issues in which different characters stole the gauntlet from Thanos or obtained it in another fashion. Beginning in August 2010, writer Brian Clevinger and artist Brian Churillathe retold the story for a younger audience in the four-issue limited series &quot;Avengers and the Infinity Gauntlet&quot; as part of the Marvel Adventures imprint. He used the basic framework of the story, but purposefully wrote it in a fashion that did not invite comparisons to the original, with which he did not believe he could compete. During the 2015 crossover &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, a five-issue limited series by Gerry Duggan and Dustin Weaver reused the title and featured similar elements.

==Merchandise==
During initial publication, Tenacity Incorporated offered a licensed black T-shirt featuring cover artwork from the series. It was available exclusively through ads placed in Marvel comics. The front side had the cover artwork from issue four, and the back had the cover artwork from issue three.

Although no contemporary toys were created for the series, several Thanos action figures have been created in the years since that include the Infinity Gauntlet either as an accessory or as part of the sculpt, such as the 12 inch Marvel Select toy and the 2 inch Super Hero Squad toy. In 2011, a Marvel Universe toyline two-pack included Thanos, Warlock, an Infinity Gauntlet accessory for Warlock, and a reprint of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #3. Some toy sets have incorporated the series logo on their packaging, such as the 2009 Minimate set with Thanos, Warlock, Mephisto, and Drax the Destroyer or the San Diego Comic-Con exclusive set with Marvel Universe editions of Thanos, Mistress Death, Eros, Nebula, and a wearable Infinity Gauntlet made of foam.

A variety of licensed merchandise shaped the like Infinity Gauntlet has been created as well, including a coin bank and earrings from Think Geek, a bottle opener from Diamond Select Toys, a coffee mug from Entertainment Earth, and an oven mitt from Loot Crate.

==Adaptations==
Capcom adapted the storyline into two video games shortly after its release. The first, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, was a fighting game released as an arcade game in 1995 before being ported to Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1997. The second, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes In War of the Gems&quot;, was a beat &#x27;em up released in 1996 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

After the animated television series &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; introduced an &quot;Infinity Sword&quot; in its first season, its second season (2010–2011) loosely adapted &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. Griptonite Games released a tie-in video game, &quot;Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, for several platforms in 2010.

In October 2011, WizKids announced they would adapt &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; into an organized play tournament for their collectible miniatures game &quot;Heroclix&quot; in 2012. Vendors who wanted to participate qualified for free game kits by purchasing a minimum amount of new Heroclix booster packs. It began in January and a new round was held once a month through August. At each round, players received a special game piece for participating and winners received limited edition pieces based on characters from the storyline. The eight participation pieces could be combined to create Thanos&#x27; shrine to Death and featured all of the gems. At the time of release, it was the largest Heroclix tournament.

In 2014, the early episodes of the second season of the animated cartoon &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; adapted the storyline. It also included elements from the Thanos-centric 2013 crossover comic series &quot;Infinity&quot; written by Jonathan Hickman and penciled by Jim Cheung, Jerome Opeña, and Dustin Weaver, such as Thanos&#x27; allies, the Black Order.

Capcom released &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in September 2017. While it features elements from the series, it is not a direct adaptation. To coincide with the game&#x27;s release, Capcom held a global tournament series called &quot;Battle for the Stones&quot;. The winner of the tournament received a cash prize and a light-up Infinity Gauntlet trophy.

An Infinity Gauntlet prop with gems was included in the 2011 film &quot;Thor&quot; as an Easter egg for fans before Marvel Studios decided the &quot;Avengers&quot; films would adapt &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. A post-credits scene in &quot;&quot; (2015) showed Thanos with a gauntlet without gems, and the one from &quot;Thor&quot; was stated to have been a fake in &quot;&quot; (2017).&lt;ref name=&quot;/FilmFeige&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 film &quot;&quot; drew inspiration from &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; and depicts Thanos collecting the Infinity Stones and using them to kill half of the universe. Its 2019 sequel, &quot;&quot;, focuses on the Avengers&#x27; attempts to undo Thanos&#x27; actions.

<text>Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human decision-making, the ability to process multiple alternatives and to follow through on a plan of action. It studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can guide models of economics.

It combines research from neuroscience, experimental and behavioral economics, and cognitive and social psychology. As research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from theoretical biology, computer science, and mathematics. Neuroeconomics studies decision-making by using a combination of tools from these fields so as to avoid the shortcomings that arise from a single-perspective approach. In mainstream economics, expected utility (EU) and the concept of rational agents are still being used. Neuroscience has the potential to reduce the reliance on this flawed assumption by inferring what emotions, habits, biases, heuristics and environmental factors contribute to individual, and societal preferences. Economists can thereby make more accurate predictions of human behavior in their models.

Behavioral economics was the first subfield to emerge to account for these anomalies by integrating social and cognitive factors in understanding economic decisions. Neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscience and psychology to understand the root of decision-making. This involves researching what occurs within the brain when making economic decisions. The economic decisions researched can cover diverse circumstances such as buying a first home, voting in an election, choosing to marry a partner or go on a diet. Using tools from various fields, neuroeconomics works toward an integrated account of economic decision-making.

== History ==

In 1989, Paul Glimcher joined the Center for Neural Science at NYU. Initial forays into neuroeconomic topics occurred in the late 1990s thanks, in part, to the rising prevalence of cognitive neuroscience research. Improvements in brain imaging technology suddenly allowed for crossover between behavioral and neurobiological enquiry. At the same time, critical tension was building between neoclassical and behavioral schools of economics seeking to produce superior predictive models of human behavior. Behavioral economists, in particular, sought to challenge neo-classicists by looking for alternative computational and psychological processes that validated their counter-findings of irrational choice. These converging trends set the stage for the sub-discipline of neuroeconomics to emerge, with varying and complementary motivations from each parent discipline.

Behavioral economists and cognitive psychologists looked towards functional brain imaging to experiment and develop their alternative theories of decision-making. While groups of physiologists and neuroscientists looked towards economics to develop their algorithmic models of neural hardware pertaining to choice. This split approach characterised the formation of neuroeconomics as an academic pursuit - not without criticism however. Numerous neurobiologists claimed that attempting to synchronise complex models of economics to real human and animal behavior would be futile. Neoclassical economists also argued that this merge would be unlikely to improve the predictive power of the existing revealed preference theory.

Despite the early criticisms, neuroeconomics grew rapidly from its inception in the late 1990s through to the 2000s. Leading many more scholars from father fields of economics, neuroscience and psychology to take notice of the possibilities of such interdisciplinary collaboration. Meetings between scholars and early researchers in neuroeconomics began to take place through the early 2000s. Important among them was a meeting that took place during 2002 at Princeton University. Organized by neuroscientist Jonathan Cohen and economist Christina Paxson, the Princeton meeting gained significant traction for the field and is often credited as the formative beginning of the present-day Society for Neuroeconomics.

The subsequent momentum continued throughout the decade of the 2000s in which research was steadily increasing and the number of publications containing the words &quot;decision making&quot; and &quot;brain&quot; rose impressively. A critical point in 2008 was reached when the first edition of Neuroeconomics: Decision Making and the Brain was published. This marked a watershed moment for the field as it accumulated the growing wealth of research into a widely accessible textbook. The success of this publication sharply increased the visibility of Neuroeconomics and helped affirm its place in economic teachings worldwide.

== Major research areas ==
The field of decision-making is largely concerned with the processes by which individuals make a single choice from among many options. These processes are generally assumed to proceed in a logical manner such that the decision itself is largely independent of context. Different options are first translated into a common currency, such as monetary value, and are then compared to one another and the option with the largest overall utility value is the one that should be chosen. While there has been support for this economic view of decision-making, there are also situations where the assumptions of optimal decision-making seem to be violated.

The field of neuroeconomics arose out of this controversy. By determining which brain areas are active in which types of decision processes, neuroeconomists hope to better understand the nature of what seem to be suboptimal and illogical decisions. While most of these scientists are using human subjects in this research, others are using animal models where studies can be more tightly controlled and the assumptions of the economic model can be tested directly.

For example, Padoa-Schioppa &amp; Assad tracked the firing rates of individual neurons in the monkey orbitofrontal cortex while the animals chose between two kinds of juice. The firing rate of the neurons was directly correlated with the utility of the food items and did not differ when other types of food were offered. This suggests that, in accordance with the economic theory of decision-making, neurons are directly comparing some form of utility across different options and choosing the one with the highest value. Similarly, a common measure of prefrontal cortex dysfunction, the FrSBe, is correlated with multiple different measures of economic attitudes and behavior, supporting the idea that brain activation can display important aspects of the decision process.

Neuroeconomics studies the neurobiological along with the computational bases of decision-making. A framework of basic computations which may be applied to Neuroeconomics studies is proposed by A. Rangel, C. Camerer, and P. R. Montague. It divides the process of decision-making into five stages implemented by a subject. First, a representation of the problem is formed. This includes analysis of internal states, external states and potential course of action. Second, values are assigned to potential actions. Third, based on the valuations, one of the actions is selected. Fourth, the subject evaluates how desirable the outcome is. In the final stage, learning, includes updating all of the above processes in order to improve future decisions.

=== Decision-making under risk and ambiguity ===
Most of our decisions are made under some form of uncertainty. Decision sciences such as psychology and economics usually define risk as the uncertainty about several possible outcomes when the probability of each is known. When the probabilities are unknown, uncertainty takes the form of ambiguity. Utility maximization, first proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, is used to explain decision-making under risk. The theory assumes that humans are rational and will assess options based on the expected utility they will gain from each.

Research and experience uncovered a wide range of expected utility anomalies and common patterns of behavior that are inconsistent with the principle of utility maximization – for example, the tendency to overweight small probabilities and underweight large ones. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky proposed prospect theory to encompass these observations and offer an alternative model.

There seem to be multiple brain areas involved in dealing with situations of uncertainty. In tasks requiring individuals to make predictions when there is some degree of uncertainty about the outcome, there is an increase in activity in area BA8 of the frontomedian cortex as well as a more generalized increase in activity of the mesial prefrontal cortex and the frontoparietal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is generally involved in all reasoning and understanding, so these particular areas may be specifically involved in determining the best course of action when not all relevant information is available.

The Iowa Gambling Task developing in 1994, involved picking from 4 decks of cards where 2 decks were riskier, containing higher payoffs accompanied by much heftier penalties. Most individuals realise after a few rounds of picking cards that the less risky decks have higher payoffs in the long run due to the small losses, however individuals with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex continue picking from the riskier decks. These results suggested the ventromedial prefrontal region of the brain in strongly associated with recognising the long term consequences of risky behavior as patients with damage to the region struggled to make decisions that prioritised the future over the potential for immediate gain.

In situations that involve known risk rather than ambiguity, the insular cortex seems to be highly active. For example, when subjects played a &#x27;double or nothing&#x27; game in which they could either stop the game and keep accumulated winnings or take a risky option resulting in either a complete loss or doubling of winnings, activation of the right insula increased when individuals took the gamble. It is hypothesized that the main role of the insular cortex in risky decision-making is to simulate potential negative consequences of taking a gamble. Neuroscience has found the insular is activated when thinking about or experiencing something uncomfortable or painful.

In addition to the importance of specific brain areas to the decision process, there is also evidence that the neurotransmitter dopamine may transmit information about uncertainty throughout the cortex. Dopaminergic neurons are strongly involved in the reward process and become highly active after an unexpected reward occurs. In monkeys, the level of dopaminergic activity is highly correlated with the level of uncertainty such that the activity increases with uncertainty. Furthermore, rats with lesions to the nucleus accumbens, which is an important part of the dopamine reward pathway through the brain, are far more risk averse than normal rats. This suggests that dopamine may be an important mediator of risky behavior.

Individual level of risk aversion among humans is influenced by testosterone concentration. There are studies exhibiting correlation between the choice of a risky career (financial trading, business) and testosterone exposure. In addition, daily achievements of traders with lower digit ratio are more sensitive to circulating testosterone. A long-term study of risk aversion and risky career choice was conducted for a representative group of MBA students. It revealed that females are in average more risk averse, but the difference between genders vanishes for low organizational and activational testosterone exposure leading to risk-averse behavior. Students with high salivary testosterone concentration and low digit ratio, disregarding the gender, tend to choose risky career in finance (e.g. trading or investment banking).

==== Serial and functionally localized model vs distributed, hierarchical model ====

In 2017 March, Laurence T. Hunt and Benjamin Y. Hayden argued an alternative viewpoint of the mechanistic model to explain how we evaluate options and choose the best course of action. Many accounts of reward-based choice argue for distinct component processes that are serial and functionally localized. The component processes typically include the evaluation of options, the comparison of option values in the absence of any other factors, the selection of an appropriate action plan and the monitoring of the outcome of the choice. They emphasized how several features of neuroanatomy may support the implementation of choice, including mutual inhibition in recurrent neural networks and the hierarchical organization of timescales for information processing across the cortex.

===Loss aversion===
One aspect of human decision-making is a strong aversion to potential loss. Under loss aversion, the perceived cost of loss is experienced more intensely than an equivalent gain. For example, if there was a 50/50 chance of either winning $100 or losing $100, and a loss occurred, the accompanying reaction would emulate losing $200; that is the sum of both losing $100 and the possibility of winning $100. This was first discovered in Prospect Theory by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. 
One of the main controversies in understanding loss aversion is whether the phenomenon manifests in the brain, perhaps as increased attention and arousal with losses. Another area of research is whether loss aversion is evident in sub-cortices, such as the limbic system, thereby involving emotional arousal.

A basic controversy in loss aversion research is whether losses are actually experienced more negatively than equivalent gains or merely predicted to be more painful but actually experienced equivalently. Neuroeconomic research has attempted to distinguish between these hypotheses by measuring different physiological changes in response to both loss and gain. Studies have found that skin conductance, pupil dilation and heart rate are all higher in response to monetary loss than to equivalent gain. All three measures are involved in stress responses, so one might argue that losing a particular amount of money is experienced more strongly than gaining the same amount. On the other hand, in some of these studies, there was no physiological signals of loss aversion. That may suggest that the experience of losses is merely on attention (what is known as loss attention); such attentional orienting responses also lead to increased autonomic signals.

Brain studies have initially suggested that there is increased medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex rapid response following losses compared to gains, which was interpreted as a neural signature of loss aversion. However, subsequent reviews have noticed that in this paradigm individuals do not actually show behavioral loss aversion casting doubts on the interpretability of these findings.
With respect to fMRI studies, while one study found no evidence for an increase in activation in areas related to negative emotional reactions in response to loss aversion another found that individuals with damaged amygdalas had a lack of loss aversion even though they had normal levels of general risk aversion, suggesting that the behavior was specific to potential losses. These conflicting studies suggest that more research needs to be done to determine whether brain response to losses is due to loss aversion or merely to an alerting or orienting aspect of losses; as well as to examine if there are areas in the brain that respond specifically to potential losses .

=== Intertemporal choice ===
In addition to risk preference, another central concept in economics is intertemporal choices which are decisions that involve costs and benefits that are distributed over time. Intertemporal choice research studies the expected utility that humans assign to events occurring at different times. The dominant model in economics which explains it is discounted utility (DU). DU assumes that humans have consistent time preference and will assign value to events regardless of when they occur. Similar to EU in explaining risky decision-making, DU is inadequate in explaining intertemporal choice.

For example, DU assumes that people who value a bar of candy today more than 2 bars tomorrow, will also value 1 bar received 100 days from now more than 2 bars received after 101 days. There is strong evidence against this last part in both humans and animals, and hyperbolic discounting has been proposed as an alternative model. Under this model, valuations fall very rapidly for small delay periods, but then fall slowly for longer delay periods. This better explains why most people who would choose 1 candy bar now over 2 candy bars tomorrow, would, in fact, choose 2 candy bars received after 101 days rather than the 1 candy bar received after 100 days which DU assumes.

Neuroeconomic research in intertemporal choice is largely aimed at understanding what mediates observed behaviors such as future discounting and impulsively choosing smaller sooner rather than larger later rewards. The process of choosing between immediate and delayed rewards seems to be mediated by an interaction between two brain areas. In choices involving both primary (fruit juice) and secondary rewards (money), the limbic system is highly active when choosing the immediate reward while the lateral prefrontal cortex was equally active when making either choice. Furthermore, the ratio of limbic to cortex activity decreased as a function of the amount of time until reward. This suggests that the limbic system, which forms part of the dopamine reward pathway, is most involved in making impulsive decisions while the cortex is responsible for the more general aspects of the intertemporal decision process.

The neurotransmitter serotonin seems to play an important role in modulating future discounting. In rats, reducing serotonin levels increases future discounting while not affecting decision-making under uncertainty. It seems, then, that while the dopamine system is involved in probabilistic uncertainty, serotonin may be responsible for temporal uncertainty since delayed reward involves a potentially uncertain future. In addition to neurotransmitters, intertemporal choice is also modulated by hormones in the brain. In humans, a reduction in cortisol, released by the hypothalamus in response to stress, is correlated with a higher degree of impulsivity in intertemporal choice tasks. Drug addicts tend to have lower levels of cortisol than the general population, which may explain why they seem to discount the future negative effects of taking drugs and opt for the immediate positive reward.

=== Social decision-making ===
While most research on decision-making tends to focus on individuals making choices outside of a social context, it is also important to consider decisions that involve social interactions. The types of behavior that decision theorists study are as diverse as altruism, cooperation, punishment, and retribution. One of the most frequently utilized tasks in social decision-making is the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

In this situation, the payoff for a particular choice is dependent not only on the decision of the individual but also on that of another individual playing the game. An individual can choose to either cooperate with his partner or defect against the partner. Over the course of a typical game, individuals tend to prefer mutual cooperation even though defection would lead to a higher overall payout. This suggests that individuals are motivated not only by monetary gains but also by some reward derived from cooperating in social situations. 
This idea is supported by neural imaging studies demonstrating a high degree of activation in the ventral striatum when individuals cooperate with another person but that this is not the case when people play the same prisoner&#x27;s dilemma against a computer. The ventral striatum is part of the reward pathway, so this research suggests that there may be areas of the reward system that are activated specifically when cooperating in social situations. Further support for this idea comes from research demonstrating that activation in the striatum and the ventral tegmental area show similar patterns of activation when receiving money and when donating money to charity. In both cases, the level of activation increases as the amount of money increases, suggesting that both giving and receiving money results in neural reward.

An important aspect of social interactions such as the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is trust. The likelihood of one individual cooperating with another is directly related to how much the first individual trusts the second to cooperate; if the other individual is expected to defect, there is no reason to cooperate with them. Trust behavior may be related to the presence of oxytocin, a hormone involved in maternal behavior and pair bonding in many species. When oxytocin levels were increased in humans, they were more trusting of other individuals than a control group even though their overall levels of risk-taking were unaffected suggesting that oxytocin is specifically implicated in the social aspects of risk taking. However this research has recently been questioned.

One more important paradigm for neuroeconomic studies is ultimatum game. In this game Player 1 gets a sum of money and decides how much he wants to offer Player 2. Player 2 either accepts or rejects the offer. If he accepts both players get the amount as proposed by Player 1, if he rejects nobody gets anything. Rational strategy for Player 2 would be to accept any offer because it has more value than zero. However, it has been shown that people often reject offers that they consider as unfair. Neuroimaging studies indicated several brain regions that are activated in response to unfairness in ultimatum game. They include bilateral mid-anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial supplementary motor area (SMA), cerebellum and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). It has been shown that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of DLPFC increases the likelihood of accepting unfair offers in the ultimatum game.

Another issue in the field of neuroeconomics is represented by role of reputation acquisition in social decision-making. Social exchange theory claims that prosocial behavior originates from the intention to maximize social rewards and minimize social costs. In this case, approval from others may be viewed as a significant positive reinforcer - i.e., a reward. Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence supporting this idea – it was shown that processing of social rewards activates striatum, especially left putamen and left caudate nucleus, in the same fashion these areas are activated during the processing of monetary rewards. These findings also support so-called &quot;common neural currency&quot; idea, which assumes existence of shared neural basis for processing of different types of reward.

===Sexual decision-making===
Regarding the choice of sexual partner, research studies have been conducted on humans and on nonhuman primates. Notably, Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1990, Deaner et al. 2005, and Hayden et al. 2007 suggest a persistent willingness to accept fewer physical goods or higher prices in return for access to socially high-ranking individuals, including physically attractive individuals, whereas increasingly high rewards are demanded if asked to relate to low-ranking individuals.

Cordelia Fine is most well known for her research on gendered minds and sexual decision-making. In her book &quot;Testosterone Rex&quot; she critiques sex differences in the brain and goes into detail on the economic cost and benefits of finding a partner, as interpreted and analysed by our brains. Her work showcases an interesting sub-topic of neuroeconomics.

The neurobiological basis for this preference includes neurons of the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), which is related to eye movement, and which is operative in situations of two-alternative forced choices.

==Methodology==
Behavioral economics experiments record the subject&#x27;s decisions over various design parameters and use the data to generate formal models that predict performance. Neuroeconomics extends this approach by adding states of the nervous system to the set of explanatory variables. The goal of neuroeconomics is to help explain decisions and to enrich the data sets available for testing predictions.

Furthermore, neuroeconomic research is being used to understand and explain aspects of human behavior that do not conform to traditional economic models. While these behavior patterns are generally dismissed as &#x27;fallacious&#x27; or &#x27;illogical&#x27; by economists, neuroeconomic researchers are trying to determine the biological reasons for these behaviors. By using this approach, researchers may be able to find explanations for why people often act sub-optimally. Richard Thaler provides a prime example in his book &quot;Misbehaving&quot;, detailing a scenario where an appetiser is served before a meal and guest accidentally fill up of it. Most people need the appetiser to be completely hidden in order to stop themselves from the temptation, where as a rational agent would simply stop and wait for the meal. Temptation is just one of the many irrationalities that have been ignored due to difficulties of studying them

===Neurobiological research techniques===
There are several different techniques that can be utilized to understand the biological basis of economic behavior. Neural imaging is used in human subjects to determine which areas of the brain are most active during particular tasks. Some of these techniques, such as fMRI or PET are best suited to giving detailed pictures of the brain which can give information about specific structures involved in a task. Other techniques, such as ERP (event-related potentials) and oscillatory brain activity are used to gain detailed knowledge of the time course of events within a more general area of the brain. If a specific region of the brain is suspected to be involved in a type of economic decision-making, researchers may use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt that region, and compare the results to when the brain was allowed to function normally. More recently, there has been interest in the role that brain structure, such as white matter connectivity between brain areas, plays in determining individual differences in reward-based decision-making.

Neuroscience does not always involve observing the brain directly, as brain activity can also be interpret by physiological measurements such skin conductance, heart rate, hormones, pupil dilation and muscle contraction known as electromyography, especially of the face to infer emotions linked to decisions.
===Neuroeconomics of addiction===

In addition to studying areas of the brain, some studies are aimed at understanding the functions of different brain chemicals in relation to behavior. This can be done by either correlating existing chemical levels with different behavior patterns or by changing the amount of the chemical in the brain and noting any resulting behavioral changes. For example, the neurotransmitter serotonin seems to be involved in making decisions involving intertemporal choice while dopamine is utilized when individuals make judgments involving uncertainty. Furthermore, artificially increasing oxytocin levels increases trust behavior in humans while individuals with lower cortisol levels tend to be more impulsive and exhibit more future discounting.

In addition to studying the behavior of neurologically normal individuals in decision-making tasks, some research involves comparing that behavior to individuals with damage to areas of the brain expected to be involved in decision-making. In humans, this means finding individuals with specific types of neural impairment. These case studies may have things like amygdala damage, leading to a decrease in loss aversion compared to controls. Also, scores from a survey measuring prefrontal cortex dysfunction are correlated with general economic attitudes, like risk preferences.

Previous studies investigated the behavioral patterns of patients with psychiatric disorders, or neuroeconomics of addiction, such as schizophrenia, autism, depression,to get the insights of their pathophysiology. In animal studies, highly controlled experiments can get more specific information about the importance of brain areas to economic behavior. This can involve either lesioning entire brain areas and measuring resulting behavior changes or using electrodes to measure the firing of individual neurons in response to particular stimuli.

==Notable theorists==
==Experiments==
As explained in Methodologies above, in a typical behavioral economics experiment, a subject is asked to make a series of economic decisions. For example, a subject may be asked whether they prefer to have 45 cents or a gamble with a 50% chance to win one dollar. Many experiments involve the participant completing games where they either make one-off of repeated decisions and psychological responses and reaction time is measured. For example, it is common to test peoples relationship with the future, known as future discounting, by asking them questions such as &quot;would you prefer $10 today, or $50 in a year from today?&quot; The experimenter will then measure different variables in order to determine what is going on in the subject&#x27;s brain as they make the decision.
Some authors have demonstrated that neuroeconomics may be useful to describe not only experiments involving rewards but also common psychiatric syndromes involving addiction or delusion.

==Criticisms==
From the beginnings of neuroeconomics and throughout its swift academic rise, criticisms have been voiced over the field&#x27;s validity and usefulness. Glenn W. Harris and Emanuel Donchin have both criticized the emerging field, with the former publishing his concerns in 2008 with the paper &#x27;Neuroeconomics: A Critical Reconsideration&#x27;.
 Harris surmises that much of the neuroscience-assisted insights into economic modelling is &quot;academic marketing hype&quot; and that the true substance of the field is yet to present itself and needs to be seriously reconsidered. He also mentions that methodologically, many of the studies in neuroeconomics are flawed by their small sample sizes and limited applicability.

A review of the learnings of neuroeconomics, published in 2016 by Arkady Konovalov, shared the sentiment that the field suffers from experimental shortcomings. Primary among them being a lack of analogous ties between specific brain regions and some psychological constructs such as &quot;value&quot;. The review mentions that although early neuroeconomic fMRI studies assumed that specific brain regions were singularly responsible for one function in the decision-making process, they have subsequently been shown to be recruiting in multiple different functions. The practice of reverse inference has therefore seen much less use and has hurt the field. Instead, FMRI should not be a standalone methodology, but rather be collected and connected to self-reports and behavioral data. The validity of using functional neuroimaging in consumer neuroscience can be improved by carefully designing studies, conducting meta-analyses, and connecting psychometric and behavioral data with data from neuroimaging.

Ariel Rubinstein, an economist at the University of Tel Aviv, spoke about neuroeconomic research, saying &quot;standard experiments provide little information about the procedures of choice as it is difficult to extrapolate from a few choice observations to the entire choice function. If we want to know more about human procedures of choice we need to look somewhere else&quot;. These comments echo a salient and consistent argument of traditional economists against the neuroeconomic approach that the use of non-choice data, such as response times, eye-tracking and neural signals that people generate during decision-making, should be excluded from any economic analysis.

Other critiques have also included claims that neuroeconomics is &quot;a field that oversells itself&quot;; or that neuroeconomic studies &quot;misunderstand and underestimate traditional economic models&quot;.

==Applications==

Currently, the real-world applications and predictions of neuroeconomics are still unknown or under-developed as the burgeoning field continues to grow. Some criticisms have been made that the accumulation of research and its findings have so far produced little in the way of pertinent recommendations to economic policy-makers. But many neuroeconomists insist that the potential of the field to enhance our understanding of the brain&#x27;s machinations with decision-making may prove highly influential in the future.

In particular, the findings of specific neurological markers of individual preferences may have important implications for well-known economic models and paradigms. An example of this is the finding that an increase in computational capacity (likely related to increased gray matter volume) could lead to higher risk tolerance by loosening the constraints that govern subjective representations of probabilities and rewards in lottery tasks.

Economists are also looking at neuroeconomics to assist with explanations of group aggregate behavior that have market-level implications. For example, many researchers anticipate that neurobiological data may be used to detect when individuals or groups of individuals are likely to exhibit economically problematic behavior. This may be applied to the concept of market bubbles. These occurrences are majorly consequential in modern society and regulators could gain substantial insights into their formulation and lack of prediction/prevention.

Neuroeconomic work has also seen a close relationship with academic investigations of addiction. Researchers acknowledged, in the 2010 publication &#x27;Advances in the Neuroscience of Addiction: 2nd Edition&#x27;, that the neuroeconomic approach serves as a &quot;powerful new conceptual method that is likely to be critical for progress in understanding addictive behavior&quot;.

German neuroscientist Tania Singer spoke at the World Economic Forum in 2015 about her research in compassion training. While economics and neuroscience are largely spilt, her research is an example of how they can meld together. Her study revealed a preference change toward prosocial behavior after 3 months of compassion training. She also demonstrated a structural change in the grey matter of the brain indicating new neural connections had formed as a result of the mental training. She showed that if economists utilised predictors other than consumption, they could model and predict a more diverse range of economic behaviors. She also advocated that neuroeconomics could vastly improve policymaking as we can create contexts that predictably lead to positive behavioral outcomes such as prosocial behavior when caring emotions are primed. Her research demonstrates the impact neuroeconomics could have on our individual psyches, our societal norms and political landscapes at large.

Neuromarketing is another applied example of a distinct discipline closely related to neuroeconomics. While broader neuroeconomics has more academic aims, since it studies the basic mechanisms of decision-making, neuromarketing is an applied sub-field which uses neuroimaging tools for market investigations. Insights derived from brain imaging technologies (fMRI) are typically used to analyse the brain&#x27;s response to particular marketing stimuli.

Another neuroscientist, Emily Falk contributed to the neuroeconomics and neuromarketing fields by researching how the brain reacts to marketing aimed at evoking behavioral change. Specifically, her paper on anti-smoking advertisements highlighted the disparity between what advertisements we believe will be convincing and what the brain responds to most positively. The advertisement the experts and trial audience agreed on as being the most effective anti-smoking campaign actually elicited very little behavioral change in smokers. Meanwhile, the campaign ranked least likely to be effective by the experts and audience, generated the strongest neural response in the medial prefrontal cortex and resulted in the largest number of people deciding to quit smoking. This revealed that often our brains may know better than us when it comes to what motivators lead to behavioral change. It also emphasises the importance of integrating neuroscience into mainstream and behavioral economics to generate more wholistic models and accurate predictions. This research could have impacts in promoting healthier diets, more exercise, or encouraging people to make behavioral changes that benefit the environment and reduce climate change.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, a canonical, normal, or standard form of a mathematical object is a standard way of presenting that object as a mathematical expression. Often, it is one which provides the simplest representation of an object and allows it to be identified in a unique way. The distinction between &quot;canonical&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; forms varies from subfield to subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a &quot;unique&quot; representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero. More generally, for a class of objects on which an equivalence relation is defined, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example:

*Jordan normal form is a canonical form for matrix similarity.
*The row echelon form is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an invertible matrix.

In computer science, and more specifically in computer algebra, when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a canonical form is a representation such that every object has a unique representation (with canonicalization being the process through which a representation is put into its canonical form). Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms.

Despite this advantage, canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), which introduce difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, &quot;normal form&quot; is a weaker notion: A normal form is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.

Canonical form can also mean a differential form that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.

==Definition==
Given a set &quot;S&quot; of objects with an equivalence relation &quot;R on S&quot;, a canonical form is given by designating some objects of &quot;S&quot; to be &quot;in canonical form&quot;, such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in &quot;S&quot; represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test equality on their canonical forms.
A canonical form thus provides a classification theorem and more, in that it not only classifies every class, but also gives a distinguished (canonical) representative for each object in the class.

Formally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;S&quot; is a mapping &quot;c&quot;:&quot;S&quot;→&quot;S&quot; such that for all &quot;s&quot;, &quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2 ∈ &quot;S&quot;:
#&quot;c&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;(&quot;c&quot;(&quot;s&quot;))   (idempotence),
#&quot;s&quot;1 &quot;R&quot; &quot;s&quot;2 if and only if &quot;c&quot;(&quot;s&quot;1) = &quot;c&quot;(&quot;s&quot;2)   (decisiveness), and
#&quot;s&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;c&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)   (representativeness).

Property 3 is redundant; it follows by applying 2 to 1.

In practical terms, it is often advantageous to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; to its canonical form &quot;s&quot;*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in modular arithmetic, the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives, and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.
The uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, such as allowing for reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem. For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;x&quot; + 30 than &quot;x&quot; + 30 + &quot;x&quot;2, although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of Jordan canonical form for a matrix is a deep theorem.

==History==
According to OED and LSJ, the term &quot;canonical&quot; stems from the Ancient Greek word &quot;kanonikós&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;regular, according to rule&quot;) from &quot;kanṓn&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;rod, rule&quot;). The sense of , , or archetype has been used in many disciplines. Mathematical usage is attested in a 1738 letter from Logan. The German term &quot;kanonische Form&quot; is attested in a 1846 paper by Eisenstein, later the same year Richelot uses the term &quot;Normalform&quot; in a paper, and in 1851 Sylvester writes:

In the same period, usage is attested by Hesse (&quot;Normalform&quot;), Hermite (&quot;forme canonique&quot;), Borchardt (&quot;forme canonique&quot;), and Cayley (&quot;canonical form&quot;).

In 1865, the Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art defines canonical form as:

==Examples==
Note: in this section, &quot;up to&quot; some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.

===Large number notation===
Standard form is used by many mathematicians and scientists to write extremely large numbers in a more concise and understandable way, the most prominent of which being the scientific notation.

===Number theory===
*Canonical representation of a positive integer
*The canonical form of a continued fraction for representing a number is the simple continued fraction

===Linear algebra===
===Algebra===
===Geometry===
In analytic geometry:
*The equation of a line: &quot;Ax&quot; + &quot;By&quot; = &quot;C&quot;, with &quot;A2&quot; + &quot;B&quot;2 = 1 and &quot;C&quot; ≥ 0
*The equation of a circle: formula_1

By contrast, there are alternative forms for writing equations. For example, the equation of a line may be written as a linear equation in point-slope and slope-intercept form.

Convex polyhedra can be put into canonical form such that:
*All faces are flat,
*All edges are tangent to the unit sphere, and
*The centroid of the polyhedron is at the origin.

===Integrable systems===
Every differentiable manifold has a cotangent bundle. That bundle can always be endowed with a certain differential form, called the canonical one-form. This form gives the cotangent bundle the structure of a symplectic manifold, and allows vector fields on the manifold to be integrated by means of the Euler-Lagrange equations, or by means of Hamiltonian mechanics. Such systems of integrable differential equations are called integrable systems.

===Dynamical systems===
The study of dynamical systems overlaps with that of integrable systems; there one has the idea of a normal form (dynamical systems).

===Three dimensional geometry===
In the study of manifolds in three dimensions, one has the first fundamental form, the second fundamental form and the third fundamental form.

===Functional analysis===
===Classical logic===

*Negation normal form
*Conjunctive normal form
*Disjunctive normal form
*Algebraic normal form
*Prenex normal form
*Skolem normal form
*Blake canonical form, also known as the complete sum of prime implicants, the complete sum, or the disjunctive prime form

===Set theory===
*Cantor normal form of an ordinal number

===Game theory===
*Normal form game

===Proof theory===
*Normal form (natural deduction)

===Rewriting systems===

The symbolic manipulation of a formula from one form to another is called a &quot;rewriting&quot; of that formula. One can study the abstract properties of rewriting generic formulas, by studying the collection of rules by which formulas can be validly manipulated. These are the &quot;rewriting rules&quot;—an integral part of an abstract rewriting system. A common question is whether it is possible to bring some generic expression to a single, common form, the normal form. If different sequences of rewrites still result in the same form, then that form can be termed a normal form, with the rewrite being called a confluent. It is not always possible to obtain a normal form.

===Lambda calculus===
*A lambda term is in beta normal form if no beta reduction is possible; lambda calculus is a particular case of an abstract rewriting system. In the untyped lambda calculus, for example, the term formula_2 does not have a normal form. In the typed lambda calculus, every well-formed term can be rewritten to its normal form.

===Graph theory===

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, graph canonization is the problem of finding a canonical form of a given graph &quot;G&quot;. A canonical form is a labeled graph Canon(&quot;G&quot;) that is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;, such that every graph that is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot; has the same canonical form as &quot;G&quot;. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of graph isomorphism: to test whether two graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(&quot;G&quot;) and Canon(&quot;H&quot;), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

===Computing===
In computing, the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called &quot;data normalization&quot;.

For instance, database normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency.

In the field of software security, a common vulnerability is unchecked malicious input (see &quot;Code injection&quot;). The mitigation for this problem is proper input validation. Before input validation is performed, the input is usually normalized by eliminating encoding (e.g., HTML encoding) and reducing the input data to a single common character set.

Other forms of data, typically associated with signal processing (including audio and imaging) or machine learning, can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.

In content management, the concept of a single source of truth (SSOT) is applicable, just as it is in database normalization generally and in software development. Competent content management systems provide logical ways of obtaining it, such as transclusion.

<text>The Committee on Armed Services, sometimes abbreviated SASC for Senate Armed Services Committee, is a committee of the United States Senate empowered with legislative oversight of the nation&#x27;s military, including the Department of Defense, military research and development, nuclear energy (as pertaining to national security), benefits for members of the military, the Selective Service System and other matters related to defense policy. The Armed Services Committee was created as a result of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 following the U.S. victory in World War II. The bill merged the responsibilities of the Committee on Naval Affairs, established in 1816, and the Committee on Military Affairs, also established in 1816.

Considered one of the most powerful Senate committees, its broad mandate allowed it to report some of the most extensive and revolutionary legislation during the Cold War years, including the National Security Act of 1947. The committee tends to take a more bipartisan approach than other committees, as many of its members formerly served in the military or have major defense interests located in the states they come from. The committee&#x27;s regular legislative product is the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which has been passed by Congress and signed into law annually since 1962.

The current chair is Republican Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and the Ranking Member is Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island.

==Jurisdiction==
According to the Standing Rules of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects are referred to the Armed Services Committee:

# Aeronautical and space activities pertaining to or primarily associated with the development of weapons systems or military operations.
# Common defense.
# Department of Defense, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force, generally.
# Maintenance and operation of the Panama Canal, including administration, sanitation, and government of the Canal Zone.
# Military research and development.
# National security aspects of nuclear energy.
# Naval petroleum reserves, except those in Alaska.
# Pay, promotion, retirement, and other benefits and privileges of members of the Armed Forces, including overseas education of civilian and military dependents.
# Selective service system.
# Strategic and critical materials necessary for the common defense.

<doc id="515104" wikidata="Q197869" url="?curid=515104" title="Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection">
<text>Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection is an idea about genetic variance in population genetics developed by the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. The proper way of applying the abstract mathematics of the theorem to actual biology has been a matter of some debate, however, it is a true theorem.

It states:
:&quot;The rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time.&quot;

Or in more modern terminology:
:&quot;The rate of increase in the mean fitness of any organism, at any time, that is ascribable to natural selection acting through changes in gene frequencies, is exactly equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time&quot;.

== History ==
The theorem was first formulated in Fisher&#x27;s 1930 book &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot;. Fisher likened it to the law of entropy in physics, stating that &quot;It is not a little instructive that so similar a law should hold the supreme position among the biological sciences&quot;. The model of quasi-linkage equilibrium was introduced by Motoo Kimura in 1965 as an approximation in the case of weak selection and weak epistasis.

Largely as a result of Fisher&#x27;s feud with the American geneticist Sewall Wright about adaptive landscapes, the theorem was widely misunderstood to mean that the average fitness of a population would always increase, even though models showed this not to be the case. In 1972, George R. Price showed that Fisher&#x27;s theorem was indeed correct (and that Fisher&#x27;s proof was also correct, given a typo or two), but did not find it to be of great significance. The sophistication that Price pointed out, and that had made understanding difficult, is that the theorem gives a formula for part of the change in gene frequency, and not for all of it. This is a part that can be said to be due to natural selection.

Due to confounding factors, tests of the fundamental theorem are quite rare though Bolnick in 2007 did test this effect in a natural population.

<text>Bill &quot;Herman&quot; Hamilton (born 12 February 1945) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s. Known as Herman by teammates after his resemblance to popular television character Herman Munster, he played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership as a front rower for the Manly-Warringah and North Sydney clubs, winning the 1972 and 1973 premierships with the Sea Eagles. He also gained selection for the Australia on the 1973 Kangaroo Tour though he only played in eight minor matches and didn&#x27;t play a test.

Unwanted by Manly at the end of 1974, he went on to captain the North Sydney Bears, bringing much needed discipline to a club regarded as &#x27;easybeats&#x27;. Hamilton captain-coached the club to their last major trophy the Channel 10 Challenge Cup in 1978.

In 2010 he was named at prop forward in Kurri Rugby League Club&#x27;s team of the century.

A retired policeman, Bill Hamilton lives in Tea Gardens on the NSW Mid North Coast where he has given a lot of his time to the Men of League Foundation.

<text>The Poodle, called the in German () and the in French, is a breed of water dog. The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10–18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.

The Poodle likely originated in Germany, although the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI, International Canine Federation) and a minority of cynologists believe it originated in France. Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century. Larger Poodles were originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club (AKC) soon after the clubs&#x27; founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed enormous popularity as pets and show dogs – Poodles were the AKC&#x27;s most registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI&#x27;s third most registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.

== History ==

Most cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany in the Middle Ages, from a dog similar to today&#x27;s Standard Poodle. The Poodle was Germany&#x27;s water dog, just as England had the English Water Spaniel, France the Barbet, Ireland the Irish Water Spaniel and the Netherlands the Wetterhoun. Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or &quot;Pudel&quot; in German, which is derived from the Low German word &quot;puddeln&quot;, meaning &quot;to splash&quot;. Numerous works by various German artists from as early as the 17th century depict dogs of recognisably Poodle type. Some cynologists believe the Poodle originated in France, where it is known as the &quot;Caniche&quot; and that the breed descends from the Barbet. This view is shared by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI, International Canine Federation). Others argue that the breed originated in Russia, Piedmont or Northwest Africa.

Whatever the Poodle&#x27;s country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle&#x27;s ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.

=== Size variants ===
Due to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks poodles were frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France. In French circuses poodles were selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the miniature poodle, which was known as the toy poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus. As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.

The Toy Poodle was created at the beginning of the 20th century when breeders again bred Miniature Poodles down in size to create a popular companion dog. Initially, these efforts resulted in disfigured or misshapen pups, as well as pups with behavioural problems, as a result of irresponsible breeding for dwarfed size only. As new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy-sized replica of the original. Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.

The last of the Poodle varieties to be recognised was the Medium Poodle, which in size is mid way in between the Standard and the Miniature Poodle. Not universally recognised by the world&#x27;s kennel clubs, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs. One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety may have been a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at conformation shows.

=== Recent history ===
The Poodle was recognised by the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom in 1874, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, soon after the founding of both clubs. In the United States, poodles were unpopular until 1935, when the Poodle Nunsoe Duc de la Terrace won best in show at Westminster. Afterwards, they rapidly gained prominence, becoming the AKC&#x27;s most registered breed from 1960 to 1982. Since 1935, Poodles have won best in show at Westminster 10 times, the second-most of any breed. As of 2012, the Poodle was the third-most popular FCI registered breed worldwide, after the Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd, with 118,653 new dogs registered per year from the 25 countries surveyed.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the varieties differing mostly by size. The FCI&#x27;s breed standard states the Standard Poodle stands between , the Medium Poodle between , the Miniature Poodle between and the Toy Poodle .

The kennel clubs which do not recognise the Medium Poodle variety typically have the Standard Poodle between and Miniature Poodle between , with the toy variety remaining unchanged.

A healthy adult Standard Poodle typically weighs between , a Medium Poodle between , a Miniature Poodle between and a Toy Poodle between .

==== Coat ====
Poodles have thick, curly coats with harsh fur. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a Poodle every four to eight weeks.

Poodles are often cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual Poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. However, researchers have generally not found a difference in allergens across breeds.

====Clips and grooming ====

The FCI and AKC allows Poodles to be shown in the Puppy, Continental (Lion in the FCI standard), English Saddle, or Sporting (Modern) clip. The FCI additionally recognizes the Scandinavian clip. The most popular in the show ring is the Continental clip, where the face and rear end of the body are clipped, leaving tufts on the hocks and tip of the tail and rosettes on the hips. A similar clip was historically used to prevent the poodle from getting weighted down by their fur when swimming to retrieve a bird, while still leaving their joints and vital organs covered. Pet poodles are most often clipped similarly to the Sporting clip —evenly over their entire body, with the face and paws cut shorter.

In most cases, whether a Poodle is in a pet or show clip, the hair is completely brushed out. Poodle hair can also be &quot;corded&quot; with rope-like mats similar to those of a Komondor or human dreadlocks. Though once as common as the curly Poodle, corded Poodles are now rare. Corded coats are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing. Corded Poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows.

==== Colours ====
The Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, café au lait, silver beige, cream, apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, sable, brindle and phantom. Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, fawn, brindle, black&amp;fawn, brown&amp;fawn, bicolor and tricolor. Recognition of multi-colored Poodles varies by registry. They were common historically, but became less popular in the early 1900s, and are excluded from many registries. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured and multi-colored coats; however, only solid-colored poodles may compete in conformation.

A parti-Poodle has patches of any other solid colour over a primarily white coat. When a parti-coloured Poodle has black-and-white markings that resemble those of a tuxedo, it is called a &quot;tuxedo&quot; Poodle. An abstract Poodle is primarily solid-coloured, with patches of white. Phantom Poodles have a solid main color with a lighter colour appearing on their &quot;eyebrows&quot;, muzzle and throat, legs and feet and below their tail. Phantom Poodles may also have a full face of the secondary color.

=== Temperament ===
Poodles are a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. A 1994 book by Stanley Corey ranked them second out of 130 breeds in &quot;working and obedience intelligence&quot;, a measure of their ability to learn from humans. Shyness or sharpness is considered a serious fault in the breed.

== Health ==
The life expectancy of the Poodle varies based on size, as smaller dogs live longer than larger dogs. A study in Japan found the Toy Poodle to have a life expectancy of 12.7 years. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2005 Swedish study found 25% of miniature and toy Poodles died by the age of 10, less than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

Poodles suffer from a number of hereditary diseases. The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles. Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are the skin disease sebaceous adenitis (estimated prevalence 2.7%) and Addison’s disease, an endocrine system disorder. Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid breeding aimed at producing good show dogs. The breeding focused on a small number of popular bloodlines, creating a genetic bottleneck. One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling village dogs.

The Poodle is predisposed to the following dermatological conditions: allergic skin disease, alopecia X or follicular arrest, injection site alopecia, otitis externa, melanoma, and sebaceous adenitis.

The Poodle is predisposed to hypothyroidism and Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

The Poodle is one of the more commonly affected breeds for progressive rod-cone degeneration. An autosomal recessive mutation in the PRCD gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

==Work and sport==
Poodles were originally bred for waterfowl hunting. Despite this history, they are currently classified as companion dogs by the FCI. Since the late 1980s, some breeders in the United States and Canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting, with some success. Poodles are highly trainable dogs that typically excel in obedience training. Historically, they were a popular circus dog. In addition to hunt tests, they do well in agility and rally. They are among the most popular service dog breeds.

Poodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century, most likely because of their highly intelligent, trainable nature. Their background as a hunting dog makes them suitable to battlefields, and they can be trained to ignore gunfire. During the English Civil War, Prince Rupert of the Rhine had a famous hunting Poodle who would ride into battle with his master on horseback. Napoleon Bonaparte wrote in his memoirs about the faithfulness of a grenadier&#x27;s pet Poodle who stayed with the body of his master at the Battle of Marengo.

==Cultural references==
The perceived passive and obedient nature of the breed has led to use in politics of &quot;poodle&quot; as a political pejorative to assert the sycophancy of a politician who obediently or passively follows the lead of others. It is considered to be equivalent to &quot;lackey&quot;. The term was used as a label to criticise British Prime Ministers who are perceived to be too close to the United States. During the 2000s, it was used against Tony Blair with regard to his close relationship with George W. Bush and the involvement of the United Kingdom in the Iraq War. The singer George Michael used it in his song &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot; in July 2002, the video of which showed Blair as the &quot;poodle&quot; on the lawn of the White House. Romanian-Israeli politician Colette Avital unsuccessfully tried to have the term&#x27;s use banned from the Knesset in June 2001. By extension, the phrase &quot;attack poodle&quot; has been used to denote a particularly vociferous but servile defender of a given political leader, party, or faction. It gained popular currency in 2002 when Paul Marsden a member of the British Parliament who ran afoul of the Labour party Chief Whip Hilary Armstrong charged that Prime Minister Tony Blair was setting out &quot;one of his attack poodles&quot; to bring him or her into line. The term was further popularized by the American culture critic James Wolcott in his 2004 book, &quot;Attack Poodles and Other Media Mutants&quot;.

<doc id="515122" wikidata="Q3622440" url="?curid=515122" title="New Zealand National Front">
<text>The New Zealand National Front was a small white nationalist organisation in New Zealand.

==History==
===First formation in 1967===
Mirroring developments in the UK, a group called the National Front evolved from the New Zealand branch of the League of Empire Loyalists in 1967. It was led by Brian Thompson; another notable member was Roger Clare who would later become an activist with the League of St George. It published a magazine called &quot;Counter-attack&quot;. This group dissolved by the beginning of the 1970s. Thompson remained an overseas supporter of the UK National Front.

===Recreation of the late 1970s===

The National Front of New Zealand, commonly known as the &quot;New Zealand National Front&quot; (NZNF), was an initiative of John Tyndall of the British National Front formed in 1977. Sister organisations were also formed in Australia and South Africa at the same time.

The party&#x27;s first chairman was David Crawford, aided by Brian Thompson. Kerry Bolton joined in 1978. It distributed &quot;large numbers of Holocaust denial pamphlets and books&quot;. Thompson represented the party at the march in Lewisham in 1977. The party encouraged its activists to infiltrate mainstream parties such as the National Party. From June 1978 the party jointly published a magazine called &quot;Frontline&quot; with the National Front of Australia. After the end of the Australian group in 1984, the magazine continued until March 1987 in support of a more general non-party &quot;nationalist cause&quot;.

The organisation became close to ending during the early 1980s; many of its members left to form the &#x27;New Force&#x27; which Bolton formed in 1981.

===Later activity ===
In 1989 Anton Foljambe sought to revive the &quot;Frontline&quot; title for his &quot;Conservative Front&quot; grouping. This led to the reformation of the NZNF with Foljambe as leader. It published a magazine, edited by Foljambe, called &quot;Viewpoint&quot;. Foljambe resigned as leader in 1997 and established the rival National Democrats Party in 1999. Kyle Chapman, who said he had been interested in right-wing politics since the age of 12, then led the party until he resigned as leader in 2005. Bolton rejoined the party in 2004. From 2008, Colin Ansell led the group. Ansell stated that the group was to be a &quot;broad spectrum nationalist movement&quot; with a &quot;strong view on immigration&quot;.

On 23 October 2004, the National Front held a protest in Wellington to support retaining the current New Zealand flag, which was attended by an estimated 45 people. An 800-strong counter-demonstration was organised by the MultiCultural Aotearoa coalition and anarchists to expose the sympathies of the National Front. According to &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, Chapman complained the following day of &quot;insufficient police protection&quot;. This &quot;Flag Day Rally&quot; has now become an annual event, with NF members and protesters squaring off outside parliament.

In October 2017, a handful of National Front members protested outside Parliament. They were met by &quot;a sea&quot; of counter-protesters. Fights came close to breaking out and police attended the event.

After the Christchurch mosque shootings of 2019, the National Front like other far-right groups &quot;publicly shut up shop&quot; and largely went underground. An RNZ documentary of April 2019 described them as &quot;the old guard of the far-right&quot; in comparison to new movements with more sophisticated networks and use of technology.

== As a political party ==

The National Front has described itself as a political party, in 2010. Leader Kyle Chapman contested the 2004 Christchurch mayoral election, receiving 1,665 votes (1.9%) and coming fifth out of ten candidates. In a blog post, then-former-leader Kyle Chapman declared the National Front would be joining with the National Democrats and another international organisation, the &#x27;New Right&#x27; to contest the 2008 election under the name &quot;Nationalist Alliance&quot;. This did not occur; no candidates contested the 2008 election under that name.

==Policies==
According to &quot;Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand&quot;, the discernible policies of the National Front are &quot;homophobia, racism and patriotic nationalism.&quot;

<text>Vadodara (), formerly Baroda, is a major city in the Indian state of Gujarat. It serves as the administrative headquarters of the Vadodara district and is situated on the banks of the Vishwamitri River, from the state capital of Gandhinagar. The railway line and National Highway 8, which connect Delhi with Mumbai, pass through Vadodara. The city is named for its abundance of banyan (&quot;vad&quot;) trees. Vadodara is also locally referred to as the &quot;Sanskrutik Nagari&quot; () and &quot;Kala Nagari&quot; () of India.

The city is prominent for landmarks such as the Laxmi Vilas Palace, which served as the residence of the Maratha royal Gaekwad dynasty that ruled over Baroda State. It is also the home of the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.

==Etymology==
The city was once called Chandanavati after Raja Chandan of the Dodiya Rajputs. The capital was also known as Virakshetra (Land of Warriors). Later, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodará, and according to tradition, is a corrupt form of the Sanskrit word &quot;vatodara&quot;, meaning &quot;in the belly of the banyan tree&quot;. It is, as of 2009, almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; early English travelers and merchants of the 15th century mention the town as Baroda, and it is from this, that the name Baroda is derived; in 1974 (well after independence), the official name of the city was changed to Vadodara.

==History==
===Prehistory===
At Akota, now a suburb of Vadodara, excavations have found rich microlith deposits, providing early evidence of habitation in the area. These prehistoric people took part in hunting and fishing and lived no later than 1000 BCE.

===First millennium CE===
By the first centuries CE, Akota was the site of a commercial town with far-reaching trade links. Known in antiquity as &quot;Aṅkoṭṭaka&quot;, it had well-built houses made from burnt bricks. Two re-struck coins of the early Western Satraps have been found here, along with artifacts possibly of Greco-Roman origin. A Gupta-era coin has also been found here.

Akota flourished under the Maitraka dynasty, although it experienced periodic severe flooding. A huge hoard of Jain bronzes, largely dating from this period, was found at Akota&#x27;s old site, indicating that the city was a centre of Jainism. The bronzes include images of various tirthankaras as well as an elephant-shaped incense burner. Many of them have inscriptions that have been used to indicate when they were made.

In the 6th century, the town&#x27;s inhabitants shifted away from the river to a new site near Akota&#x27;s modern centre. At Kothi, which also now forms part of Vadodara, evidence of habitation also first emerges during this period.

An early mention of Vadodara itself is in an 812 copper-plate grant of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. It records Karka Suvarṇavasha, second ruler of the Lata branch of the Rashtrakutas, giving the village of &quot;Vaḍapadraka&quot;, in the province of Aṅkoṭṭaka and identified with present-day Vadodara, to a Brahmin from Valabhi. Meanwhile, Akota continued to flourish during this period.

===Chaulukya period: from village to city===
By the 11th century, under the Chaulukya dynasty, Vadodara appears to have gained in importance. A plate dated to 1077 mentions a battle on the bank of the Vishvamitri river in the vishaya of &quot;Vaṭapadraka&quot;, which had evidently replaced the earlier province of Aṅkoṭṭaka. The Akota bronzes continue until the 11th century but cease thereafter. The main centre of Jainism in the area shifted to Vadodara. By this period, Vadodara is referred to as a &quot;pura&quot;, or city, rather than just a village.

A manuscript of the Panchavastuka written at Vadodara in 1123 indicates that the province of Lāṭa was then governed by Santūka, a minister of the Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja. At some point, Santūka organised a rathayatra, or chariot procession, at &quot;Vaṭapadraka&quot;. Several other manuscripts from Vadodara are known from this period, including a Prakrit work composed by Chandraprabhasuri in 1128 along with two copies of Jain works made in 1156 and 1168 respectively. Another manuscript, although copied at Dabhoi, was written by a scribe named Vosari whose father was a pandit named Kesava who came from Vadodara.

During this period, merchants from Vadodara contributed to the temples at the Chaulukya capital of Patan. At some point, the minister Tejpal, returning from a victory at Godhra, stopped at Vadodara for several days and renovated the local shrine of Parshvanatha. Around 1264, shrines to Mahavira and Adishvara were built at Vadodara by one Pethad Shah.

===Delhi Sultanate===
Under the Delhi Sultanate, Vadodara was home to a group of Afghan amirs known collectively as the &quot;Amir-i Sadgan&quot;, or &quot;the nobles of the hundred&quot;, because each one commanded a force of 100 cavalry. In 1344, during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq, they revolted. Led by one Qazi Jalal, they defeated Muqbil, the sultan&#x27;s main deputy in Gujarat, in a decisive battle near Dabhoi. They went on to occupy a large territory stretching from Kadi in the north to Bharuch in the south, and from Khambhat in the west to the hill country in the east. In 1345, Muhammad bin Tughluq led an army to Gujarat to put down the rebellion and, after initially camping at Pandu Mewas, defeated them in battle at Bharuch.

===Gujarat Sultanate===
Muzaffar Shah I, founder of the Gujarat Sultanate, appointed his son Firuz Khan as governor of Vadodara at some point. After Muzaffar Shah&#x27;s death in 1411, he was succeeded by his grandson Ahmad Shah I (Firuz&#x27;s nephew). Firuz immediately laid claim to the throne. Because the sultanate&#x27;s central authority in central and southern Gujarat was weak at this point, Firuz had little trouble assembling an army at Vadodara. He then marched to Nadiad and then to Bharuch, which he seized by force. Ultimately, the rebellion dissipated without a pitched battle: internal tensions had already arisen among Firuz Khan&#x27;s main allies, and when Ahmad Shah offered them amnesty in return for standing down, they readily complied. Firuz Khan was forgiven and given Navsari as a jagir, thus giving up his position as governor of Vadodara.

In 1451, Vadodara was sacked by troops under Mahmud Khalji, ruler of the Malwa Sultanate. Later, during the reign of Mahmud Begada, a major re-foundation of Vadodara took place. A new city called &quot;Daulatabad&quot; was built, close to the old site. The Muslim name evidently did not stick, but the city itself did, and this new foundation became the basis for the modern city of Vadodara. A later atlas by John Ogilby refers to people moving from the old town to the new one.

===Mughal Empire===
After Akbar conquered Gujarat in 1573, he gave Vadodara to one Nawab Aurang Khan. There was an administrative reform under Akbar&#x27;s reign, and Raja Todar Mal conducted a land survey of parts of Gujarat. Vadodara, however, does not seem to have been included in this survey.

In the late 1600s, Gujarat was increasingly attacked by Maratha and Koli raids. One raid, by the Kolis, hit Vadodara in 1705; they looted the city for two days.

===Baroda State===

The city is located on the fertile plain between the Mahi and Narmada Rivers. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the cosmopolis falls under seismic zone-III, on a scale of I to V (in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes).

===Climate===

Vadodara features a borderline tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) that despite the roughly of rain that the city receives annually is due to the area&#x27;s high potential evapotranspiration very close to being classified as a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;). There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is dry. The weather is hot during March to July, when the average maximum is , and the average minimum is . From November to February, the average maximum temperature is , the average minimum is , and the climate is extremely dry. Cold northerly winds are responsible for mildly chilly days in January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average rainfall is , but infrequent, torrential rains cause the river to flood like the 2005 Gujarat flood or the 2008 Indian floods, which were catastrophic.

The highest recorded temperature was on 11 May 1960 crossed with on 19 May 2016, while the lowest recorded temperature was on 15 January 1935.

Vadodara has been ranked 6th best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India.

The taxes include general taxes, conservancy taxes, and water taxes, whereas the nontax or service revenue can include water charges, rent from municipal properties, public service charges, etc. The VMC budget for the year 2020–2021 against the proposed budget of Rs 3,554 crore last year, stood at Rs 3,770 crore this year.

===Petrochemicals===
Since the discovery of oil and natural gas in the area, Vadodara has become the site of various petrochemical industries. These are concentrated in the peri-urban areas to the northwest and south of the city proper.

In 1963, construction began on Gujarat Refinery outside of Vadodara, on a 1800-acre tract surrounded by the villages of Koyali, Ranoli, Karachia, and Dhanora. Jawaharlal Nehru ceremonially laid the foundation. The refinery&#x27;s first trial production was in October 1965. As of 1973 it was producing 4.3 million tonnes of various products per year and it employed some 1,450 people. It was the third public-sector refinery to be built in India.

Among the refinery&#x27;s products as of 1979 were gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, jet fuel, and various industrial materials such as benzene, toluene, and naphtha. Crude was piped in from Ankleshwar and from northern Gujarat (around Kalol and Vadagam), and condensate was also supplied from the Khambhat gas fields.

In early 1978, two new petrochemical plants began operation in Vadodara: a naphtha cracking plant in March and a low-density polyethylene plant with an 80,000-tonne capacity in April. Both were operated by Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited (now part of Reliance Industries) and both were also the first plant of their kind in Gujarat. In March 1979, IPCL also formally commissioned a major petrochemical complex at Vadodara that included an aromatics plant (producing dimethyl terephthalate and two types of xylene), an oil refinery, and seven other downstream facilities. The 7 downstream facilities were: 1. acrylonitrile, 2. synthetic rubber, 3. low-density polyethylene, 4. polypropylene, 5. ethylene glycol, 6. detergent alkylate, and 7. acrylic fibre. There were also plans in the works for a polyester yarn plant as part of the complex with a capacity of 3,500 to 7,000 tonnes per year.

==Government and politics==

The Vadodara city&#x27;s municipal corporation or Maha Nagar Palika is a part of the Vadodara district. The district is set up in three distinct levels of administration, which are the collectorate - the district falls under the jurisdiction of a collector; the prant offices which take care of the affairs of taluka and other state government offices and the mamlatdar or taluka offices.

== Civic services ==

Three civic service departments are under the municipal corporation - the engineering department, the health department, and the support or administration department.

These departments together provide services, infrastructure, and management for the entire city. The engineering department manages infrastructure and services provided through cells or subdepartments such as bridge cell, drainage project, town development, streetlight, electrical sewerage, mechanical sewerage, building project, solid-waste management, road, storm-water drainage, water work, land, and estate. The health department takes care of public health-related issues and services through its solid-waste management, health, and ICDS subdepartments.

The support department handles all IT and administration-related issues and services, with cells such as IT, accounts audit, census, PRO, election, real estate (acquisition), shops and establishment, assessment, and UCD-NULM departments.

=== Urban planning ===
The two main institutions involved in planning and development in Vadodara are VMSS and the Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA). The responsibilities of both these agencies are demarcated clearly not only physically but also functionally. The governing acts for both institutions differ. The principal responsibility of VUDA is to ensure a holistic development of the Vadodara agglomeration covering an area of , whereas VMSS is involved in the development of area of .

Vadodara&#x27;s population grew the fastest during the decade between 1961 and 1971. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation drew up the first official urban plan for the city&#x27;s growth in 1970, the Vadodara Development Plan. The VUDA was formed in 1980. The second Development Plan, developed in 1984, included decentralising the city&#x27;s infrastructure. During the mid-late 70s early 80s, development on the city&#x27;s outskirts focused on building cheap, low-income housing for industrial workers. By the 1990s, the focus had shifted to mixed-density, &quot;self-sustainable settlements&quot; in peri-urban areas, especially on the west and southwest sides of town. Farmland was purchased from nearby villages to provide space for these new developments, which caused a large drop in cultivated acreage and overall agricultural produce in the area.

Initially, major industrial development happened on the city&#x27;s north side; the east side also saw plenty of development because of its location near the old city core. The south and west were relatively less populated in comparison.

Various unplanned slum areas have been formed by rapid immigration from rural areas that outpaced formal city planning. These slum areas consist largely of temporary (&quot;kachcha&quot;) structures with communal toilets or none at all. They are often found in less-desired areas along river banks and nallahs or in other low-lying spots. Sanitation in these developments is generally poor.

A low of relatively lower-income, blue-collar workers live in industrial housing developments on Vadodara&#x27;s outskirts. Economically Weaker Section (EWS) housing and slums are located especially on the northwest, northeast, and east sides of the city. In recent decades (as of 2021), major industrial development has taken place along the NH-8 corridor. Religious institutions like temples and ashrams have especially developed on the east side of town, while the Transport Nagar development is located on the northeast.

=== Solid waste management ===

The municipal corporation under its health department provides the solid waste management for the Vadodara city. All zonal asst. municipal commissioners, zonal health officers, ward officers, sanitary inspectors are part of the solid waste management committee who need to be present during the weekly SWM coordination meetings. The department takes care of the sweeping, cleaning and maintenance along with complaint redressal. All zonal chief, assistant municipal commissioners, zonal health officers and other sanitary staff are expected to work on field between 7am to 11am on weekdays. The solid waste management also has a litter prevention system which carries out litter patrol and charges fines as administrative fees from the defaulters.

=== Water supply ===
An average of 53.2 million gallon (240 million litres) of water per day, or 38 gallon (190 litres) per person per day is provided the city daily to meets its daily water requirement. The water supply is provided by the water works department of the municipal corporation along with other agencies like the Sardar Sarovar Narmada limited who directly supply water to VMC which is looked after the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board, and the Water and Sanitation Management Organization. The city receives its drinking water supply from 16 high rise water tanks and one busting station located within the city.

The Sardar Sarovar Dam which is one of the drinking water sources for the city, had halted supply temporarily in 2019 after receiving complains about the high sulphur content from the Narmada river, but the water supply was restarted again after a few days. The other sources of water are the Mahi River for which the water is obtained from a French well that has naturally purified water through layers of sand. The Ajwa Sarovar is another source of drinking water and is filtered at Nimeta Water Purification Plant.

In January 2019, VUDA and GWSSB joined hands to reduce the acute shortage of drinking water for residential societies near close to the Vadodara city. A quantity of 3 MLD water per day for three years will be provided as a temporary measure until water from the Timbi pond and Narmada canal reaches these residences.

=== Drainage and sewage ===
The drainage is provided under the Engineering department&#x27;s drainage projects or the Public Health Engineering Laboratory (PHEL). The department provides planning, designing, estimating, tendering, executing and operating and maintaining the sewerage systems like the sewerage network, sewage pumping stations, sewage pumping mains, sewage treatment and effluent disposal works.

The sewage as of 2001 covered 55% area and 65% of the present population when the VMC limits extended to . The Public Health Engineering Laboratory (PHEL) has been working on a comprehensive sewerage system Master Plan for of sewers and nine sewage treatment works. The plan master plan is designed for the year 2021 where the project aims to increase the sewage coverage from 55% to 95% by area and 65% to 93% by population for an area of .

=== Electricity ===
Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited (MGVCL) is the main electricity provision company for the Gujarat state and Vadodara. Hydroelectricity is additionally being generated by water from Sardar Sarovar Dam with six units of river bed power houses of 200 megawatt each.

=== Fire and emergency ===

<doc id="515131" wikidata="Q1430504" url="?curid=515131" title="Flight of the Earls">
<text>On 14 September 1607, Irish earls Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O&#x27;Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, departed Rathmullan in Ireland for mainland Europe, accompanied by their families, household staff, followers and fellow Irish nobles, numbering about ninety people. The earls were patriarchs of the two most powerful clans in Ulster (the O&#x27;Neill and O&#x27;Donnell clans), and their permanent exile is seen to symbolise the end of Gaelic Irish society. This event is now known as the Flight of the Earls (), though historians such as Micheline Kerney Walsh have criticised that name.

Both earls fought against the English Crown in the Nine Years&#x27; War, which ended with their surrender in 1603. Although the earls managed to retain their lands and titles, hostility towards them from English politicians gradually increased over time. The flight was seemingly a snap decision; its exact motivation is unclear and is the subject of debate. The earls intended to reach Habsburg Spain, which had allied with the Irish confederacy during the war, but were turned away by Philip III for fear of violating the recent Treaty of London. The refugees spent time in Leuven in the Spanish Netherlands, where many of the passengers left their young children to be educated at St Anthony&#x27;s College. The earls arrived in Rome on 29 April 1608, and were granted small pensions by Pope Paul V. Tyrconnell died of a fever three months later. Tyrone repeatedly discussed plans to return to Ireland and retake his lands, but he became ill and died in 1616 before doing so. Most of the passengers on the flight never returned to Ireland. The flight was declared as treasonous by James VI and I and the earls&#x27; titles were forefeited, which led to the acquisition of the earls&#x27; lands as part of the Plantation of Ulster.

==Name==
The event was first named as a &quot;flight&quot; in an 1868 book by Reverend Charles Patrick Meehan. In Irish, the neutral term &quot;Imeacht&quot; is usually used i.e. the &quot;Departure of the Earls&quot;. The term &#x27;Flight&#x27; is translated &#x27;Teitheadh na nIarlaí&#x27; and is sometimes seen.

Historians disagree to what extent the earls wanted to start a war with Spanish help to re-establish their positions, or whether they accepted exile as the best way of coping with their recent loss of status since the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603. Meehan argued that the earls&#x27; tenants wanted a new war: &quot;Withal, the people of Ulster were full of hope that O&#x27;Neill would return with forces to evict the evictors, but the farther they advanced into this agreeable perspective, the more rapidly did its charms disappear.&quot;

==Background to the exile==
From 1593, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell of Tyrconnell led an Irish confederacy in resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland—this conflict is known as the Nine Years&#x27; War. After the confederacy&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1601, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell traveled to Spain to seek support from Philip III. Unsuccessful, he died in Spain from a sudden illness and was succeeded by his younger brother Rory O&#x27;Donnell.The O&#x27;Neills and O&#x27;Donnells retained their lands and titles, although with much-diminished extent and authority. However, the countryside was laid bare in a campaign of destruction in 1602, which induced famine in 1603. Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, was pardoned under the terms of the Treaty of Mellifont in March 1603 and submitted to the crown.

When King James VI and I took the English throne in 1603, he quickly proceeded to issue pardons for the Irish lords and their rebel forces. Already reigning as king of Scotland, he had a better understanding of the advantages from working with local chiefs in the Scottish Highlands. However, as in other Irish lordships, the 1603 peace involved O&#x27;Neill losing substantial areas of land to his cousins and neighbors, who would be granted freeholds under the English system, instead of the looser arrangements under the former Brehon law system. This was not a new policy but was a well-understood and longstanding practice in the Tudor conquest of Ireland.

On 10 September 1602, the Prince of Tyrconnell had already died, allegedly assassinated, in Spain, and his brother succeeded him as 25th Chieftain of the O&#x27;Donnell clan. He was later granted the Earldom of Tyrconnell by King James I on 4 September 1603 and restored to a somewhat diminished scale of territories in Tyrconnell on 10 February 1604.

In 1605, the new Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester, began to encroach on the former freedoms of the two Earls and The Maguire, enforcing the new freeholds, especially that granted in North Ulster to the O&#x27;Cahan chief. The O&#x27;Cahan had formerly been important subjects of the O&#x27;Neills and required protection; in turn, Chichester wanted to reduce O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s authority. O&#x27;Cahan had also wanted to remove himself from O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s overlordship. An option was to charge O&#x27;Neill with treason if he did not comply with the new arrangements. The discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in the same year made it harder for Catholics to appear loyal to both the crown and the papacy. A lengthy legal battle however found in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s favor.

By 1607, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s allies the Maguires and the Earl of Tyrconnell were finding it hard to maintain their prestige on lower incomes. They planned to seek Spanish support before news of the Battle of Gibraltar arrived. When their ship dropped anchor, O&#x27;Neill seems to have joined them on impulse. He had three options:
* Flee with his friends and hope for a reinvasion by Spain
* Go to London and stay at court until his grievances were redressed
* Do nothing and live on a reduced income as a large landowner in Ulster.

Fearing arrest, they chose to flee to Continental Europe, where they hoped to recruit an army for the invasion of Ireland with Spanish help. However, earlier in 1607 the main Spanish fleet in Europe had been defeated by the Dutch in the Battle of Gibraltar. But the oft-repeated theory that they were all about to be arrested contradicts writer Tadhg Ó Cianáin, the main historical source on the Flight, who said at the start of his account that O&#x27;Neill heard news of the ship anchored at Rathmullen on Thursday 6 September, and &quot;took his leave of the Lord Justice (Chichester) the following Saturday&quot;. They had been meeting at Slane for several days, and there is no proof that warrants for his arrest had been drawn up, nor was it a hurried departure.

As the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) had been ended by the Treaty of London in 1604, King Philip III of Spain wanted to remain at peace with England under its new Stuart dynasty. As a part of the peace proposals, a Spanish princess was to marry James&#x27; son, Henry, though this never happened. Spain had also gone bankrupt in 1598. Tyrone ignored all these realities, remained in Italy, and persisted with his invasion plan until his death in exile in 1616.

==End of the old Gaelic order==

The earls left from the town of Rathmullan with some of the leading Gaelic families in Ulster; they traveled down Lough Swilly on a French ship. Their departure was the end of the old Gaelic order, in that the earls were descended from Gaelic clan dynasties that had ruled their parts of Ulster for centuries. The Flight of the Earls was a watershed event in Irish history, as the ancient Gaelic aristocracy of Ulster went into permanent exile. Despite their attachment to and importance in the Gaelic system, the Earls&#x27; ancestors had accepted their Earldoms from the English-run Kingdom of Ireland in the 1540s, under the policy of surrender and regrant (under this policy, Anglo-Irish and Gaelic Irish rulers were to surrender themselves and their lands to Henry VIII, and he would grant their land back to them along with an English title). Some historians argue that their flight was forced upon them by the fallout from the Tudor conquest of Ireland, while others that it was an enormous strategic mistake that cleared the way for the Plantation of Ulster.

From 1616, a number of bards outside Ulster had a poetic debate in the &quot;Contention of the bards&quot; and one of the arguments celebrated King James&#x27;s Gaelic-Irish Milesian ancestry through Malcolm III of Scotland. So it is debatable whether the Gaelic order had ended or was evolving.

==Journey==
The Earls set sail from Rathmullan, a village on the shore of Lough Swilly in County Donegal, accompanied by ninety followers, many of them Ulster noblemen, and some members of their families. Several left their wives behind, hoping either to return or retrieve them later. The late Tomás Ó Fiaich, Archbishop of Armagh, gave a lecture at Rathmullan in September 1988 and recounted that the Earl of Tyrone allegedly “had a gold cross which contained a relic of the True Cross, and this he trailed in the water behind the ship, and according to O’Ciainain, it gave some relief from the storm” during the crossing to Quillebeuf-sur-Seine in Normandy, France. They finally reached the Continent on 4 October 1607. This supposed relic of the True Cross was probably a minor relic taken from that kept at Holy Cross Abbey, which they had previously visited en route to Kinsale in 1601.

Their destination was Spain, but they disembarked in France. The party proceeded overland to Spanish Flanders, some remaining in Leuven, while the main party continued to Italy. Tadhg Ó Cianáin (sometimes quoted by historians as O&#x27;Keenan) subsequently described the journey in great detail. While the party was welcomed by many important officials in the Spanish Netherlands, he makes no mention of any negotiations or planning between the earls and the Spanish to start a new war to regain the earls&#x27; properties.

Ó Cianáin&#x27;s diary is important as the only continuous and contemporaneous account of the Flight. Its original title, &quot;Turas na dTaoiseach nUltach as Éirinn&quot; – the departure of the Chiefs of Ulster from Ireland – has been changed since the creation of the more dramatic phrase &quot;Flight of the Earls&quot; to the latter&#x27;s modern literal translation, &quot;Imeacht na nIarlaí&quot;; and, according to Professor Ó Muraíle, &quot;turas&quot; can also mean a religious pilgrimage.

==Attainders==

King James issued &quot;A Proclamation touching the Earles of Tyrone and Tyrconnell&quot; on 15 November 1607, describing their action as treasonous, and therefore preparing the ground for the eventual forfeiture of their lands and titles. No reply that is known of was made to the proclamation.

Their titles were attainted in 1614, although they continued to be recognized on the Continent. The attainders were not considered legitimate in continental Catholic countries of the day. Even within the context of English and colonial Irish rule, the attainder came about six years after Rory, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, had already died. As accused, for him to have been properly tried, he should have been tried by his peers in the Peerage of Ireland, under the presiding authority of the Lord High Steward of Ireland. However, he was already dead, unable to stand in his own defense, and his title already inherited by his son Hugh “Albert” O&#x27;Donnell; therefore in order to attain the title, the trial would have to have been of Hugh “Albert”, who had in fact committed no crime. The 6-year delay in hearing the attainders was unavoidable, as his peers in the Irish House of Lords next sat in 1613, and dealt with the matter in the usual manner.

The attainder was however considered a travesty of justice by his supporters, and was considered null and void by many on the Continent. The succession of the Earl of Tyrconnell&#x27;s son, Hugh Albert O&#x27;Donnell, as 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell (1st creation) was therefore recognized as valid in the Spanish Empire, and he was given the same status under a new Spanish title &quot;Conde de Tirconnel&quot;.

Under the Common law, the title granted by King James and accepted by the earl had potentially lapsed as soon as the Earl embarked on the ship without his king&#x27;s permission to leave Ireland, and when it lapsed it could not then pass down to his descendants without some special waiver. Assuming that Hugh Albert was being punished for a crime he did not commit, and was not being given a hearing, misses the whole point of the law of attainder. Hugh Albert was never issued a Writ of Summons to sit in the Irish House of Lords as his father&#x27;s heir. Hugh Albert also never came to Dublin in 1614 to argue his case for a waiver, so far as is known, and never accepted James I as his king. Until he did so, his title and his claim to nobility were considered to be &quot;in abeyance&quot;.

These attainders had a much greater impact on the people of Ulster. The 1603 peace arrangement with the three lords was ended, as they had broken its conditions by leaving the kingdom without permission, and their remaining freehold lands were confiscated. Chichester proposed a new plantation of settlers from England, Wales and Scotland, sponsored in part by the City of London merchants, which became known as the Plantation of Ulster. This had an enormous negative impact on the lower class Gaelic-culture inhabitants of Ulster.

==Change in Spanish policy==
In the papal bull &quot;&quot; of 1555, the Pope had conferred the title King of Ireland on King Philip II of Spain when he was married to Queen Mary. Philip II made no claim to the kingship of Ireland after Mary&#x27;s death in 1558. He engaged in a lengthy war from 1585 with her sister Elizabeth I, and he and his successor Philip III supported the Irish Catholic rebels up to the siege of Kinsale in 1601. He had been offered the kingship in 1595 by O&#x27;Neill and his allies but turned it down. Given this lengthy support, it was reasonable for O&#x27;Donnell and O&#x27;Neill to imagine that they might solicit help from Philip III, but Spanish policy was to maintain the 1604 Treaty with England, and its European fleet had been weakened from several conflicts, including the Battle of Gibraltar by the Dutch over four months earlier.

Therefore, by mid-1607 Spain had neither the desire nor the means to assist an Irish rebellion. While the Flight is often described as a first step in arranging a new war, this must be seen as an emotional and false conclusion, as there were no plans or proposals at all from the Spanish side to support the earls. Spanish policy in the 1590s had been to help the Irish warlords as a nuisance against England, but they had been defeated by 1603. It could not be in any way in the interest of Spain to assist their unsuccessful former allies in 1607.

==Commemoration on the 400th anniversary==

The 400th anniversary of the Flight of the Earls was marked on 14 September 2007, throughout Donegal, including a regatta of tall ships, fireworks, lectures, and conferences. The President of Ireland Mary McAleese unveiled a statue by John Behan depicting the Flight at Rathmullan. There is a permanent exhibition dedicated to the Flight of the Earls and the subsequent plantation in Draperstown in Northern Ireland and at the &quot;Flight of the Earls Centre&quot; in the Martello tower at Rathmullan.
There were also commemorative postage stamps issued by the Irish post office, featuring Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O&#x27;Donnell, Earl of Tyrconnell, and based on original illustrations by Sean O Brogain, made as they were about to sail out of Rathmullan.

In 2008 there were also celebrations to mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the Earls in Rome, with a celebratory performance by the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland in Sant&#x27;Ignazio Church in Rome. The flight was famously depicted by Thomas Ryan in his 1958 painting &quot;The Departure of O&#x27;Neill out of Ireland&quot;.

== List of refugees ==

Tadhg Ó Cianáin kept a record of the refugees who participated in the flight. In 1972, Tomás Ó Fiaich and Pádraig de Barra published &quot;Imeacht na nIarlaí&quot;, which expanded the list of refugees based on extensive research.

<text>McFly are a British pop rock/pop band formed in London in 2003. The band took their name from the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; character Marty McFly. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, guitar, and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica, and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar, vocals) and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records.

McFly rose to fame after fellow band Busted, with whom they later formed McBusted, helped launch them by inviting them to tour in 2004. In 2005, they won the Brit Award for Best British Pop Act. McFly&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;, debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and is certified as double platinum; this led to them taking the record, in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, as being the youngest band ever to have an album debut at number one—a title taken from the Beatles. A month after the album was released, the band had their first UK headlining tour.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, which was released in 2005, also charted at number one in the UK making them the youngest band to have topped the UK Albums Chart twice. Their third album, &quot;Motion in the Ocean&quot;, was released on 6 November 2006 and charted at number 6 in the UK. McFly released their &quot;All the Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album on 5 November 2007, which charted at number 4 in the UK. The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;&quot;, was given away for free as a supplement in the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; on 20 July 2008, before being released in the conventional manner (via physical release) on 2 September 2008. Their fifth album, &quot;Above the Noise&quot;, was released in November 2010 and charted at number 20.

In November 2013, it was announced that McFly would be joining forces with Busted to form the &quot;supergroup&quot; McBusted. They played a 34-date tour with both Busted and McFly songs. The only member of the original groups not to participate in the new lineup was former Busted singer Charlie Simpson. After Simpson&#x27;s return to Busted in November 2015, McFly made a return and sold out their Anthology Tour in September 2016. After that, the band took an indefinite hiatus, with their Twitter account confirming that the boys were focusing on solo projects in 2018. In January 2019, Poynter confirmed via a podcast that the band would be reforming that year with a new album and tour. In September the band announced a new album of previously unreleased material and a concert at the O2 Arena in November 2019, followed by a 2020 come-back arena tour, this would however be delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their sixth album, &quot;Young Dumb Thrills&quot;, was released in 2020.

According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), McFly has been certified for 2 million albums and 2.8 million singles in the UK. and more than 10 million records worldwide. As of 2016, McFly have had 18 consecutive UK top 20 singles, seven of which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and fifteen of which were consecutive top ten singles.

==History==
===2002–2004: Formation and &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;===
In 2001, Tom Fletcher auditioned for Busted, but lost out on the place to Charlie Simpson. Fletcher was originally accepted as part of Busted&#x27;s line-up, but Island Records went on to reassess the situation and eventually decided to have the band as a three-piece rather than a four-piece. Though the record label decided against offering Fletcher a place in Busted, they were intrigued by his songwriting talents and later offered him a place on Busted&#x27;s songwriting &#x27;team&#x27;, alongside band member (and already accomplished songwriter) James Bourne, whom Fletcher credits with helping him to compose melodies.

While writing Busted&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot;, Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Danny Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended. Fletcher was impressed with Jones&#x27; unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne) to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the &quot;NME&quot; magazine. The pair, both from Essex, coincidentally turned up at the same audition and discussed their shared appreciation of the band the Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd&#x27;s T-shirt.

McFly&#x27;s early sound was surf/pop rock. Their debut single, &quot;5 Colours in Her Hair&quot;, released 29 March 2004, entered the UK Singles Chart at number 1 in April 2004 and stayed there the following week. In July 2004 their second single, &quot;Obviously&quot;, also topped the charts. This was followed by the album &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot; debuting at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. It would go on to be certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album broke records, as McFly earned an award from Guinness World Records for being the youngest band to have a debut album enter the charts in the top position, a distinction previously held by The Beatles. The idea for the album name came from where Jones and Fletcher wrote most of the songs for the album: room 363 in the InterContinental Hotel in London. The third single, &quot;That Girl&quot;, was released on 6 September 2004, placing at number 3. The fourth single, Room on the 3rd Floor, the album&#x27;s title track, was released on 15 November 2004 and reached number 5. McFly supported Busted on their nationwide arena tour along with V in February 2004 and then had their first headlining tour in September 2004.

===2004–2007: &quot;Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Motion in the Ocean&quot;===

In March 2005, McFly released a double A-side of &quot;All About You/You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; from their second album, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, which featured a 60-piece orchestra. The single reached number 1 for a week on 13 March 2005, with all profits donated to Comic Relief. The video for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; was shot in Uganda, Africa, which McFly visited for to raise awareness for the cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAY/YGF&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, on 2 July, McFly co-headlined Live 8 Japan, with Björk and Good Charlotte and also took part in the London concert at Hyde Park. The second single from &quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be OK&quot;, was released in the UK on 15 August 2005 and scored them their fourth UK number 1. The album itself was released on 29 August 2005 entering at number 1. The third single from &quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Hold You&quot;, was released on 17 October 2005 with an unknown song Easy Way Out on the single and it gave them their 6th top 3 single. Their fourth and final single, &quot;Ultraviolet/The Ballad of Paul K&quot; from &quot;Wonderland&quot; was released on 12 December 2005 and reached number 9. McFly headlined their Wonderland Arena Tour, which started on 15 September 2005, supported by Tyler James and Famous Last Words. A DVD of the tour, recorded live at the MEN Arena in Manchester, was released on 28 November. The band also played at the 2005 Royal Variety Performance. Nemesis, an inverted roller coaster at the Alton Towers theme park was renamed Wonderland for a month in 2005 to celebrate the album&#x27;s release. The band were filmed riding Nemesis with competition winners by music show .

In 2006, McFly turned their attentions to the United States, appearing in the Lindsay Lohan movie &quot;Just My Luck&quot;, released on 12 May, three days after the soundtrack of the movie, which comprised McFly songs taken from both &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot; and &quot;Wonderland&quot;, as well as a new version of &quot;Five Colours in Her Hair&quot;. The band played several gigs in Los Angeles and New York, as well as attending the American premiere of &quot;Just My Luck&quot; in Hollywood.

McFly&#x27;s first single of 2006 was &quot;Please, Please&quot;, released in the UK as a double A-side with a cover of the Queen hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; on 17 July as the official song for Sport Relief 2006. It reached number 1 in the UK charts on 23 July, making it the band&#x27;s fifth number 1 single of their career. On 14 September 2006, it was confirmed via an email newsletter from McFly&#x27;s official website that the third album would be called &quot;Motion in the Ocean&quot;.

===2007–2009: &quot;All the Greatest Hits&quot;, touring and &quot;Radio:Active&quot;===
McFly&#x27;s &quot;All the Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album was released on 5 November 2007 and reached number 4 in the charts.

On 23 February and 1 March 2008, they performed two small gigs at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney, Australia while recording &quot;Radio:Active&quot;. They performed the same set list as for their Greatest Hits tour. It was here where they recorded the crowd singing &quot;we don&#x27;t care&quot; which was later used on their single &quot;One for the Radio&quot;. A compilation album of B-Sides was also released on 3 December 2007, &quot;The Greatest Bits: B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;, which contains 12 B-sides of their UK singles.

On 20 May 2008, McFly confirmed that their fourth studio album would be titled &quot;&quot; (typeset as &quot;Radio:ACTIVE&quot;). It was recorded in Australia, and given away for free as a supplement in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; on 20 July 2008. It was subsequently released in stores on 22 September 2008 with four additional tracks, a DVD and a 32-page booklet. The album was announced after McFly confirmed that they had left Island Records as they were unhappy with some of the decisions that the label was making for them. Since announcing the launch of their new record label, the band have said that they &quot;won&#x27;t rule out&quot; signing other acts, but that for the moment they&#x27;re just concentrating on releasing their &quot;own stuff&quot;. &quot;Radio:Active&quot; mixes their love of vintage rock with a British twist on the modern pop-rock sound.

The first single released from the &quot;Radio:Active&quot; album was &quot;One for the Radio&quot;, a song about as the band&#x27;s &quot;constant struggle for critical acceptance&quot;. The single was premiered on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Switch with Nick Grimshaw on 1 June 2008 and was released on 14 July 2008. As of 25 June 2008, &quot;One for the Radio&quot; was included in Radio 2&#x27;s A list, meaning that it receives primary airplay during the daytime. The single charted at number 2 in the charts. The album was recorded, and produced in Australia. McFly performed a showcase concert on 10 July 2008 at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire and performed another concert at KOKO on 24 July 2008 as part of the iTunes Live Festival &#x27;08.

In 2009 McFly decided to once again arrange a tour to situate smaller venues, this time being called &quot;Up Close... And This Time It&#x27;s Personal&quot; starting on 18 April in Amsterdam. They then did 14 dates in the UK before going on to do 7 dates in South America including Brasil, Argentina and Chile. David Archuleta, the &quot;American Idol&quot; runner up, supported them on their UK stint.

Subscribers would be able to download CDs before they were sold in stores. They would also gain access to video streams, web-chats, VIP access at gigs, and first call on tickets. This website was developed in a hope to combat any leaks (piracy) and gain loyalty from their fans, as they would have access to any new materials before they could be leaked. The website had about 50,000 visitors the first day, causing the site to shut down for two weeks.

In August 2011, McFly announced that they would be doing a tour consisting of 26 dates around the UK in March/April 2012.

In September 2012, for the final Chris Moyles Show, the band put together a special video for Chris&#x27;s feature McFly day, where he would normally play Star Girl every Friday (since January 2010), this latest edition was called Star Boy as a tribute, thanking Chris Moyles for playing &quot;Star Girl&quot; every week.

In October 2012, it was announced that they would release a greatest hits which is titled &quot;Memory Lane: The Best of McFly&quot; featuring most of the band&#x27;s hits and 3 brand new songs, Love Is Easy, &quot;Do Whatcha&quot; and &quot;Cherry Cola&quot;.

During an interview with the Big Top 40 Webchat, Fletcher described the shows as his &quot;favourite shows we&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. All four shows were held in September and featured McBusted, a surprise collaboration between McFly and Busted, minus Charlie Simpson. Following the shows with Busted, the two bands announced a 30-date UK arena tour as McBusted. The McBusted Tour was the biggest tour of 2014.

In 2015, they embarked on a second McBusted tour, McBusted&#x27;s Most Excellent Adventure Tour. They also released a DVD following the tour.

On 21 June, a solo interview by Fletcher was published by Fabulous magazine in time for Father&#x27;s Day. Fletcher stated that &quot;McBusted was an opportunity to have fun without knowing where it would take us, but McFly is for life. McBusted has been amazing fun, but it&#x27;s not where our passion is. McFly is more than a band, we live and breathe it. We want to make album number six.&quot;

On a documentary with Fearne Cotton, Jones confirmed that McFly have three unreleased albums. The band were on a hiatus but Jones hinted at a future reunion, stating &quot;It&#x27;s really nice to have a bit of breathing space after 12½ years with McFly. We&#x27;ve never really had this time off, so we&#x27;ll give it a few months and see how we feel. When we&#x27;re all refreshed, we&#x27;ll go and smash an album.&quot;

===2016: Return as McFly and The Anthology===
On 25 April 2016, the band announced that they would be going back on tour in June 2016, where they would be playing all five albums and including some original new songs for a potential new album over three dates in each of four chosen cities: Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and London, with the tour called &quot;The Anthology&quot;. Talking to &quot;1883 Magazine&quot;, Fletcher said: &quot;After doing two massive Arena tours with McBusted, we really wanted to do something different for this tour to herald the return of McFly. So we&#x27;re playing some iconic rock venues that will allow our fans to experience the songs in a much more up close and personal environment.&quot; They also revealed that they&#x27;ll be making new music after the tour, with Judd stating, &quot;We all agreed to go on tour first and then that will be the catalyst of what&#x27;s to come.&quot; On 25 May 2016, it was announced the band would have to postpone the Anthology Tour due to Judd herniating a disc in his neck. McFly eventually toured in September 2016.

===2016–2019: Indefinite hiatus===
After the tour, the band revealed that they had scrapped two albums worth of songs recorded since &quot;Above the Noise&quot;. Fletcher said: &quot;After a certain amount of time, you feel like that was where you were at, at a moment[...] If we released stuff we recorded three years ago, we wouldn&#x27;t be 100 per cent behind it any more. We still love the songs but we&#x27;d be excited about doing new things.&quot; The following day, they announced that they would finally begin recording new material in January 2017. In December 2016, Judd revealed that the McBusted-recorded song &#x27;Getting It Out&#x27; would have appeared on the band&#x27;s scrapped album. McFly&#x27;s return was still in doubt, with Fletcher working on a feature-length film and regularly writing new books. Jones was said to be launching solo music and has had a new born son. In early 2018, it was announced Poynter was to go on tour with the band A. Those tour dates are now completed and it is unknown whether Poynter will play with them again. Judd was promoting his new book &#x27;Get Fit, Get Happy&#x27; as well as raising his new son Kit.

==Influence==
McFly have been cited as having influenced a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said &quot;it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, &#x27;we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar&#x27;, which is really amazing to hear. They&#x27;re the biggest band in the world right now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It&#x27;s really strange, because you feel like a veteran!&quot;. Reviews for One Direction&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Up All Night&quot;, had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released.

Also citing McFly as influences are British pop rock band The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 &quot;Memory Lane tour&quot;. Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated &quot;McFly is a band we love to be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they&#x27;re very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances.&quot; Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining &quot;McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like the next generation of their take on pop,&quot; while bassist Connor Ball continued &quot;They&#x27;re chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful.&quot; Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating &quot;Their debut album was a first in all of our collections&quot;. 5 Seconds of Summer have themselves confirmed that McFly are an influence on their music on a number of occasions, while they have also been compared to McFly in reviews. When UK pop/R&amp;B group Rixton were asked which bands they had looked up to when they were younger, Jake Roche said, &quot;I listened to a lot of McFly when I was growing up. I was a part of that era.&quot;

Asked about influencing a new generation of bands, Jones stated, &quot;There&#x27;s a few bands, like the 1D boys, and they&#x27;re all getting to that age where Busted or McFly was the first gig they ever went to. It&#x27;s really nice to see that bands are taking influence from what you do.&quot; He continued, &quot;to actually see people in bands picking up guitars and doing their thing – any musical influence that we can give them – is amazing to see.&quot;

<text>Leonard Darwin (15 January 1850 – 26 March 1943) was an English politician, economist and eugenicist. He was a son of the naturalist Charles Darwin, and also a mentor to Ronald Fisher, a statistician and evolutionary biologist.

==Biography==
Leonard Darwin was born in 1850 at Down House, Kent, into the wealthy Darwin–Wedgwood family. He was the fourth son and eighth child of the naturalist Charles Darwin and his wife Emma Wedgwood, and the last of Darwin&#x27;s immediate offspring to die. He considered himself the least intelligent of their children – brothers Frank, George and Horace were all elected Fellows of the Royal Society. He was sent to Clapham School in 1862.

Darwin joined the Royal Engineers in 1871. Between 1877 and 1882 he worked for the Intelligence Division of the Ministry of War. He went on several scientific expeditions, including those to observe the Transit of Venus in 1874 and 1882.

In 1890, Darwin was promoted to the rank of major, but soon left the army and from 1892 to 1895 was a Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield constituency in Staffordshire, where his grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood II, had also been an MP. He wrote vigorously on the economic issues of the day: bimetallism, Indian currency reform and municipal trade.

Darwin married Elizabeth Frances Fraser on . She died 16 years later, on . On , he married his second cousin, Charlotte Mildred Massingberd, granddaughter of Charlotte Wedgwood, his mother&#x27;s sister. Their shared ancestor was Josiah Wedgwood II. His wife Charlotte&#x27;s paternal grandfather married his paternal aunt, after her grandmother Charlotte&#x27;s death. Since Leonard&#x27;s parents were cousins, Charlotte was also a second cousin on his father&#x27;s side. Leonard had no children from either marriage.

He was president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1908 to 1911 and chairman of the British Eugenics Society from 1911 to 1928 – succeeding his half-cousin once removed Francis Galton. He became the society&#x27;s honorary president in 1928. In 1912 the University of Cambridge conferred on him an honorary doctorate of science.

Darwin played an important part in the life of the geneticist and statistician Ronald Fisher, supporting him intellectually, morally and sometimes financially. Fisher, replying to Darwin&#x27;s congratulations on his election to the Royal Society, replied on , &quot;I knew you would be glad, and your pleasure is as good to me almost as though my own father were still living.&quot;

Some years before, Fisher had resigned from the Royal Statistical Society after a disagreement. Darwin regretted this and engineered Fisher&#x27;s re-entry by making him a gift of a life-time subscription. Fisher&#x27;s 1930 book &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot; is dedicated to Darwin. After Darwin&#x27;s death in 1943 at the age of 93, Fisher wrote to Darwin&#x27;s niece, Margaret Keynes, &quot;My very dear friend Leonard Darwin... was surely the kindest and wisest man I ever knew.&quot;

Darwin retired to Cripps Corner at Forest Row, East Sussex in 1921, with his second wife Charlotte Mildred Massingberd (died 1940), and lived there until his death in 1943. He and Charlotte were buried at Forest Row Cemetery. Leonard Darwin was the last surviving child of Charles Darwin.

<text>Rueda de Casino (Rueda) is a type of salsa round dance, born from the Cuban dance style known as &quot;casino.&quot; Depending on the setting, the dance can be either choreographed or improvised.

== History ==
Casino was developed in Havana, Cuba in the early 1950s. Casino traces its origin as a partner dance from Cuban Urban Son and Cuban Cha Cha Cha, fused with partner figures and turns adopted from the Cuban Mambo, Rumba Guaguancó and North American Jive. Casino is different from other types of Salsa dance styles because of its spontaneous use of the rich Afro-Cuban dance vocabulary within a Casino dance; a Casino dancer frequently improvises references to other dances, integrating movements, gestures and extended passages from the folkloric and popular heritage. This is particularly true of African-descended Cubans. Such improvisations might include extracts of rumba, dances for African deities (Orishas), the older popular dances such as Cha Cha Cha and Danzón as well as anything the dancer may feel.

Casino danced with multiple partners in a circular fashion emerged in the late 1950s under the name &quot;Rueda del Casino&quot;. This dance was exclusively danced at the &quot;Club Casino Deportivo,&quot; but quickly spread to other clubs around the beachfronts and later to the capital. While the dance became popular, so did the phrases &quot;vamos a hacer la rueda como en el Casino&quot; (let&#x27;s go dance &quot;rueda&quot; like in the Casino) and &quot;vamos a hacer la rueda del Casino&quot; (let&#x27;s go dance &quot;rueda&quot; of the Casino). Given the popularity of the music and dance, numerous Rueda de Casino dance groups appeared on the island made up of friends, family members, and professional dancers. At the end of the 1970s, Rueda de Casino groups became well-known through the popular TV show &quot;Para Bailar&quot;.

As a result of the Castro regime, many Cubans emigrated to the US, many to the Miami area. They took their culture with them, including various dishes, music and dancing. Rueda de Casino began to slowly make its way into the Miami salsa community during the Mariel boatlift, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s it experienced an enormous explosion of popularity. However, the style of Rueda de Casino that became popular was a style somewhat different from its original form. Rene Gueits, founder of &quot;Salsa Lovers&quot; in 1994, changed the Cuban-style Rueda de Casino and structured it. Rene&#x27;s style adapted the Rueda de Casino steps into a more &quot;disco-like&quot; style, where the Cuban Urban Son, Cuban Cha Cha Cha, and Rumba Guaguancó were completely removed.

From Miami, Rueda de Casino spread first to major U.S. metropolitan centers with large Hispanic populations and eventually to other cities, becoming a popular dance around the United States and the world. Although the majority of the Rueda de Casino dancers have learned from the Miami-style Rueda de Casino syllabus and repertoire, many dancers from Cuba have been able to share the original version of the dance throughout the world, and most recently in the United States.

In 2014, the first International Rueda de Casino Multi Flash Mob took place in which people from 67 countries, including 199 cities, danced Rueda de Casino simultaneously. In 2017, the International Rueda de Casino Multi Flash Mob drew 230 unique groups dancing Rueda de Casino. The differences between the Miami-style Rueda de Casino and the Cuban-style Rueda de Casino are stark, and these differences can be seen throughout the performances of the 230 groups that participated in 2017.

== Description ==
The word &quot;Rueda&quot; is Spanish for a &quot;wheel,&quot; referring to the typically circular format of the dance. Rueda dancing requires a minimum of two couples, but could be as large as the maximum number of couples who can create a circle in the dance venue. (If necessary, multiple concentric circles can even be formed.) Since the 1990s, the music most commonly used for Rueda de Casino is either Salsa music or a unique variation of Salsa known as &quot;Timba.&quot;

After the initial couples (pairs of dancers) form a circle, dance moves are then called out by one person, a caller (or &quot;líder&quot; or &quot;cantante&quot; in Spanish). Although there are some similarities to square dancing, Rueda de Casino is distinguished by having a caller who is dancing along with the other participants, rather than simply standing on the outside to direct the moves. When danced socially, the order or sequence of the moves in a Rueda de Casino is completely improvised by the caller, so the dancers have to pay close attention.

Many Rueda moves have hand signs to complement the calls; these are useful in noisy venues, where spoken calls might not be easily heard. Many moves involve the swapping of partners, where the partners move around the circle to the next partner. The combination of elaborate dance combinations and constant movement of partners creates a visually spectacular effect. Also, it not uncommon for the Rueda dancers to have fun with coordinated noises such as shouts, stomps, or hand claps.

Traditionally, the names of the moves are called mostly in Spanish, regardless of the country where the dance occurs, although some words can be in English (or Spanglish; e.g., &quot;un fly&quot;). The names of most fundamental moves are similar across the board, but different towns in Cuba did begin to develop their own names for other moves. This is because some pioneers of Rueda de Casino wanted to be unique with their variations and/or simply keep others from participating in their Rueda. Many local versions of the calls (and/or changes to the steps) can now be found; indeed, the variations might change from town-to-town or even in the same town from teacher-to-teacher.

The Rueda dance will either start from &quot;al Medio&quot; (normal closed hold with all the couples stepping in and out of the circle) or from Guapea (stepping forward on the inside foot and backward on the outside foot, tangent to the circle). Some of the most common fundamental moves in Rueda include Dame, Enchufe/Enchufla, Vacila, and Sombrero. There are different hand motions that the caller can use to indicate a specific Rueda move, especially in case one&#x27;s voice cannot be heard over loud music. For example, the hand signal for the Rueda move &quot;Sombrero&quot; (i.e., the Spanish word for &quot;hat&quot;) is the caller tapping the top of his or her head.

== Filmography ==
Rueda de Casino scenes may be seen in the movie &quot;Dance with Me&quot; and in the music video clip &quot;No me dejes de querer&quot; by Gloria Estefan. Rueda de casino dance may also be seen in the documentary film &quot;La Salsa Cubana&quot;.

<text>The Ghost and the Darkness is a 1996 American historical adventure film directed by Stephen Hopkins and starring Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas. The screenplay, written by William Goldman, is a fictionalized account of the Tsavo man-eaters, a pair of male lions that terrorized workers in and around Tsavo, Kenya during the building of the Uganda-Mombasa Railway East Africa in 1898.

The film received mixed reviews and grossed $87 million against a production budget of $55 million. It won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing for supervising sound editor Bruce Stambler.

==Plot==
In 1898, Robert Beaumont, the primary financier of a railway project in Tsavo, Kenya, seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, an Anglo-Irish military engineer, to get the project on schedule. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, promising his wife, Helena, that he will complete the bridge and be back in London for the birth of their child. Shortly after his arrival, he meets British supervisor Angus Starling, Kenyan foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne informs Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the undertaking.

That same night, Patterson ends the life of an approaching lion with a single gunshot, earning the respect of the laborers and allowing them to resume their activities safely. Only a few weeks after, however, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent. At sunrise, his mutilated body is recovered, and Patterson tries another night-time hunt, seeking to catch the lion that ate Mahina. In the morning, he is informed by Starling that the corpse of a second worker has been found at the opposing end of the camp from his position.

Patterson, heeding the advice of Samuel, employs the workers in building thorn fences around the tents in order to prevent any lions from entering. Several days later, in broad daylight, a lion assails the camp, killing another worker. As Patterson, Starling, and Samuel corner the lion while it is feasting on the body, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, slicing Starling across the throat and injuring Patterson on the left arm. Patterson recovers and attempts to shoot them, but both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of man-eaters before; they have always been solitary hunters.

The workers, led by a man named Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson and, consequently, progress on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England as protection, but he is denied. During a brief visit to the site, Beaumont threatens Patterson that, should his commission not be concluded on time, he will tarnish his reputation. He also announces that he will be contacting the famed hunter Charles Remington to help Patterson in eliminating the threat due to his past failures.

A short time later, Remington reaches Tsavo with the company of skilled Maasai warriors, who dub the lions &quot;the Ghost&quot; and &quot;the Darkness&quot; because of their notorious methods. Remington&#x27;s initial attempt to trap one lion in a thicket fails when Patterson&#x27;s borrowed gun misfires. The warriors decide to leave, daunted by the beast, but Remington elects to stay behind. He constructs a new hospital tent for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. The man-eaters seemingly fall for the trap, but Remington and Patterson shoot at them, and they retreat to the new hospital, slaughtering many patients and Hawthorne.

Abdullah and the workers depart, leaving Patterson, Remington, and Samuel alone. The former two locate the animals&#x27; lair and discover the bones of dozens of victims, leading Remington to the realization that the lions are acting as they have been merely for sport. Back at camp that evening, Patterson mounts a hunting stand in a clearing and lures one of the predators to his position using a baboon as bait. The plan goes awry after Patterson falls from the stand, but Remington manages to slay the feline before it can leap on Patterson. He, Patterson, and Samuel spend the remainder of the night drinking and celebrating, but the next morning, Patterson awakes to find that the remaining lion has devoured Remington as he and Samuel slept.

The two men cremate Remington&#x27;s remains and burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the trap that they have set there. It ambushes them on the partially constructed bridge and, after a lengthy chase, Patterson finally dispatches it with a double-rifle Samuel has thrown to him from a nearby tree. Abdullah and the workers return, and the bridge is completed on time. Patterson reunites with his wife and meets their son for the first time.

==Production ==
The film is based upon &quot;The Man-eaters of Tsavo&quot; by Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Patterson, the man who actually killed both real lions.

===Screenplay===
William Goldman first heard about the story when travelling in Africa in 1984, and thought it would make a good script. In 1989 he pitched the story to Paramount as a cross between &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot;, and they commissioned him to write a screenplay which he delivered in 1990.

&quot;My particular feeling is that they were evil,&quot; said Goldman of the lions. &quot;I believe that for nine months, evil popped out of the ground at Tsavo.&quot;

The script fictionalizes Patterson&#x27;s account, introducing an American big game hunter called Charles Remington. The character was based on Anglo-Indian big game hunter Charles H. Ryall, superintendent of the Railway Police. In original drafts the character was called Redbeard, and Goldman says his purpose in the story was to create an imposing character who could be killed by the lions and make Patterson seem more brave; Goldman says his ideal casting for the role would have been Burt Lancaster.

According to Goldman, Kevin Costner expressed interest in playing Patterson, but Paramount wanted to use Tom Cruise who ultimately declined. Work on the film slowed until Michael Douglas moved his producing unit with partner Steven Reuther, Constellation Films, to Paramount. Douglas read the script and loved it, calling it &quot;an incredible thriller about events that actually took place.&quot; Douglas decided to produce and Stephen Hopkins was hired to direct.

Val Kilmer, who had just made &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and was a frequent visitor to Africa, then expressed enthusiasm for the script, which enabled the project to be financed.

The part of Remington was originally offered to Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins but both declined; the producers were considering asking Gérard Depardieu when Douglas decided to play the role himself. Stephen Hopkins later said he was unhappy about this.

In early drafts of the script, Remington was originally going to be an enigmatic figure but when Douglas chose to play him, the character&#x27;s role was expanded and was given a history. In Goldman&#x27;s book &quot;Which Lie Did I Tell?&quot;, the screenwriter argues that Douglas&#x27; decision ruined the mystery of the character, making him a &quot;wimp&quot; and a &quot;loser&quot;.

===Locations===
The film was shot mainly on location at Songimvelo Game Reserve in South Africa, rather than Kenya, due to tax laws. Many Maasai characters in the film were actually portrayed by South African actors, although the Maasai depicted during the hunt were portrayed by real Maasai warriors who were hired for the movie.

===Filming===
While the real man-eaters were, like all lions from the Tsavo region, a more aggressive, maneless variety, those used for filming were actually the least aggressive available, for both safety and aesthetic reasons. Paramount&#x27;s cinematic lions were two male African lions with manes. They were mostly performed by Caesar and Bongo of Clarington, Ontario, Canada&#x27;s Bowmanville Zoo. Caesar and Bongo were also featured in &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;. This cinematic production featured three other male African lions: two from France and one from the United States.

Director Stephen Hopkins later said of the shoot:
We had snake bites, scorpion bites, tick bite fever, people getting hit by lightning, floods, torrential rains and lightning storms, hippos chasing people through the water, cars getting swept into the water, and several deaths of crew members, including two drownings... Val came to the set under the worst conditions imaginable. He was completely exhausted from doing &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;; he was dealing with the unfavorable publicity from that set; he was going through a divorce; he barely had time to get his teeth into this role before we started; and he is in nearly every scene in this movie. But I worked him six or seven days a week for four months under really adverse conditions, and he really came through. He had a passion for this film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its opening weekend, &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; grossed $10.3 million. The film ultimately grossed over $38.6 million domestically, and $87 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing (Bruce Stambler) at the 69th Academy Awards. However, Val Kilmer was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor along with &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;. Reviews were mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 51% rating based on 53 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; hits its target as a suspenseful adventure, but it falls into a trap of its own making whenever it reaches for supernatural profundity.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert said the film was so awful it &quot;lacked the usual charm of being so bad it&#x27;s funny&quot; adding it was &quot;an African adventure that makes the Tarzan movies look subtle and realistic&quot;. Ebert would put the film on his list of the worst movies of 1996. Conversely, David R. Ellis listed this film at #8 on his &quot;Top 10 Animal Horror Movies&quot; countdown, a list he made to promote the release of &quot;Shark Night 3D&quot;.

Hopkins said in a 1998 interview that the film &quot;was a mess... I haven&#x27;t been able to watch it.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; was released by Paramount Home Video on DVD on December 1, 1998.

On May 10, 2022, Shout! Factory issued &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; on Blu-Ray in a new 4K scan.

==Historical accuracy==

Although Patterson claimed the lions were responsible for up to 135 deaths, a peer-reviewed paper on man-eating lions and the circumstances surrounding this notorious event states that about 28–31 killings can be verified (Kerbis Peterhans &amp; Gnoske, 2001).

Patterson&#x27;s 1907 book itself states that &quot;between them (the lions) no less than 28 Indian coolies, in addition to scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was kept&quot; were killed. This lesser number was confirmed in the definitive paper on man-eating behavior and the Tsavo lions by Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske (2001) and soon thereafter in Dr. Bruce Patterson&#x27;s definitive book &quot;The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa&#x27;s Notorious Man-Eaters&quot; published by McGraw-Hill in 2004. Kerbis Peterhans &amp; Gnoske showed that the greater toll attributed to the lions resulted from a pamphlet written by Col. Patterson in 1925, stating &quot;these two ferocious brutes killed and devoured, under the most appalling circumstances, 135 Indian and African artisans and laborers employed in the construction of the Uganda Railway.&quot;

The location where the bridge was built is now called Man-Eater&#x27;s Camp. It is in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya, about east of Mount Kilimanjaro and southeast of Nairobi, at

<doc id="515152" wikidata="Q3052004" url="?curid=515152" title="Fisherian runaway">
<text>Fisherian runaway or runaway selection is a sexual selection mechanism proposed by the mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century, to account for the evolution of ostentatious male ornamentation by persistent, directional female choice. An example is the colourful and elaborate peacock plumage compared to the relatively subdued peahen plumage; the costly ornaments, notably the bird&#x27;s extremely long tail, appear to be incompatible with natural selection. Fisherian runaway can be postulated to include sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits such as behavior expressed by a particular sex.

Extreme and (seemingly) maladaptive sexual dimorphism represented a paradox for evolutionary biologists from Charles Darwin&#x27;s time up to the modern synthesis. Darwin attempted to resolve the paradox by assuming heredity for both the preference and the ornament, and supposed an &quot;aesthetic sense&quot; in higher animals, leading to powerful selection of both characteristics in subsequent generations. Fisher developed the theory further by assuming genetic correlation between the preference and the ornament, that initially the ornament signalled greater potential fitness (the likelihood of leaving more descendants), so preference for the ornament had a selective advantage. Subsequently, if strong enough, female preference for exaggerated ornamentation in mate selection could be enough to undermine natural selection even when the ornament has become non-adaptive. Over subsequent generations this could lead to runaway selection by positive feedback, and the speed with which the trait and the preference increase could (until counter-selection interferes) increase exponentially.

Modern descriptions of the same mechanism using quantitative genetic and population genetic models were mainly established by Russell Lande and Mark Kirkpatrick in the 1980s, and are now more commonly referred to as the sexy son hypothesis.

== History ==

=== From Charles Darwin to Ronald Fisher ===

Charles Darwin published a book on sexual selection in 1871 called &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;, which garnered interest upon its release but by the 1880s the ideas had been deemed too controversial and were largely neglected. Alfred Russel Wallace disagreed with Darwin, particularly after Darwin&#x27;s death, that sexual selection was a real phenomenon.

Ronald Fisher was one of the few other biologists to engage with the question. When Wallace stated that animals show no sexual preference in his 1915 paper, &quot;The evolution of sexual preference,&quot; Fisher publicly disagreed:

Fisher, in the foundational 1930 book, &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot;, first outlined a model by which runaway inter-sexual selection could lead to sexually dimorphic male ornamentation based upon female choice and a preference for &quot;attractive&quot; but otherwise non-adaptive traits in male mates. He suggested that selection for traits that increase fitness may be quite common:

A strong female choice for the expression alone, as opposed to the function, of a male ornament can oppose and undermine the forces of natural selection and result in the runaway sexual selection that leads to the further exaggeration of the ornament (as well as the preference) until the costs (incurred by natural selection) of the expression become greater than the benefit (bestowed by sexual selection).

=== Peacocks and sexual dimorphism ===
The plumage dimorphism of the peacock and peahen of the species within the genus &quot;Pavo&quot; is a prime example of the ornamentation paradox that has long puzzled evolutionary biologists; Darwin wrote in 1860:The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!The peacock&#x27;s colourful and elaborate tail requires a great deal of energy to grow and maintain. It also reduces the bird&#x27;s agility, and may increase the animal&#x27;s visibility to predators. The tail appears to lower the overall fitness of the individuals who possess it. Yet, it has evolved, indicating that peacocks who have longer and more colourfully elaborate tails have some advantage over peacocks who do not. Fisherian runaway posits that the evolution of the peacock tail is made possible if peahens have a preference to mate with peacocks that possess a longer and more colourful tail. Peahens that select males with these tails in turn have male offspring that are more likely to have long and colourful tails and thus are more likely to be sexually successful themselves. Equally importantly, the female offspring of these peahens are more likely to have a preference for peacocks with longer and more colourful tails. However, though the relative fitness of males with large tails is higher than those without, the absolute fitness levels of all the members of the population (both male and female) is less than it would be if none of the peahens (or only a small number) had a preference for a longer or more colourful tail.

== Mechanism ==

=== Initiation ===

Fisher outlined two fundamental conditions that must be fulfilled for the Fisherian runaway mechanism to lead to the evolution of extreme ornamentation: 

# Sexual preference in at least one of the sexes
# A corresponding reproductive advantage to the preference.

Fisher argued in his 1915 paper, &quot;The evolution of sexual preference&quot;, that the type of female preference necessary for Fisherian runaway could be initiated without any understanding or appreciation for beauty. Fisher suggested that any visible features that indicate fitness, that are not themselves adaptive, that draw attention, and that vary in their appearance amongst the population of males so that the females can easily compare them, would be enough to initiate Fisherian runaway. This suggestion is compatible with his theory, and indicates that the choice of feature is essentially arbitrary, and could be different in different populations. Such arbitrariness is borne out by mathematical modelling, and by observation of isolated populations of sandgrouse, where the males can differ markedly from those in other populations.

=== Genetic basis ===

Fisherian runaway assumes that sexual preference in females and ornamentation in males are both genetically variable (heritable).

=== Female choice ===
Fisher argued that the selection for exaggerated male ornamentation is driven by the coupled exaggeration of female sexual preference for the ornament.

=== Positive feedback ===

Over time a positive feedback mechanism, one that involves a loop in which an increase in a quantity causes a further increase in the same quantity, will see more exaggerated sons and choosier daughters being produced with each successive generation; resulting in the runaway selection for the further exaggeration of both the ornament and the preference (until the costs for producing the ornament outweigh the reproductive benefit of possessing it).

== Alternative hypotheses==

Several alternative hypotheses use the same genetic runaway (or positive feedback) mechanism but differ in the mechanisms of the initiation. Indicator hypotheses suggest that females choose desirably ornamented males because the cost of producing the desirable ornaments is indicative of good genes by way of the individual&#x27;s vigour; for instance, the handicap principle proposes that females distinguish the best males by the measurable cost of certain visible features which have no other purpose, by analogy with a handicap race, in which the best horses carry the largest weights.

The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that sexual preferences for exaggerated traits are the result of sensory biases, such as that for supernormal stimuli.

<text>Otto Wichterle (; 27 October 1913 – 18 August 1998) was a Czech chemist, best known for his invention of modern soft contact lenses.

Wichterle is the author or co-author of approximately 180 patents and over 200 publications. The studies and independent books covered various aspects of organic, inorganic and macromolecular chemistry, polymer science, and biomedical materials. He held a higher number of patents for organic synthesis, polymerization, fibres, the synthesis and shaping of biomedical materials, production methods and measuring devices related to biomedical products. This was typical of his attitude to scientific research, which, he considered, ought to serve society and its requirements by any means possible, without distinction as to &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;applied&quot; science.

==Schooling and chemistry background==

Wichterle&#x27;s father Karel ,was co-owner of a successful farm-machine factory and small car plant but Otto chose science for his career. After finishing high school (today&#x27;s Wolker Grammar School) in Prostějov, Wichterle began to study at the Chemical and Technological Faculty of the Czech Technical University (now the independent University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague) but he was also interested in medicine. He graduated in 1936, and stayed at the university. In 1939 , he submitted his second doctorate thesis on chemistry, but the Protectorate regime blocked any further activity at the university. However, Wichterle was able to join the research institute at Baťa&#x27;s works in Zlín and continue his scientific work.

At Baťa&#x27;s institute Wichterle led the technical preparation of plastics, namely polyamide and caprolactam. In 1941, Wichterle&#x27;s team invented the procedure to throw and spool polyamide thread, thus making the first Czechoslovak synthetic fiber under the name &quot;silon&quot; (the invention came independently of the original American nylon procedure in 1938). Wichterle was imprisoned by the Gestapo in 1942 but was released after a few months.

After World War II, Wichterle returned to the university, specializing in organic chemistry, and was active in teaching general and inorganic chemistry. He wrote an inorganic chemistry textbook, the concept of which was ahead of its time, and also wrote a German and Czech organic chemistry textbook. In 1949 he expanded his second doctorate with the technology of plastics and devoted himself fully to the establishment of a new department of plastics technology.

==Contact lenses==
===Prototype development===
In 1952, he was made dean of the newly established Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague. From that time on, Wichterle devoted himself to studying the synthesis of cross-linking hydrophilous gels, with the aim of finding a material suitable for use in permanent contact with living tissues. Wichterle accepted the help of one of his colleagues, Drahoslav Lím, and together they succeeded in preparing a cross-linking gel which absorbed up to 40% water, exhibited suitable mechanical properties and was transparent. This new material was the Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), that they patented in 1953.
Wichterle thought pHEMA might be a suitable material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses. In 1954 this material was first used as an orbital implant. In 1957 Wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses from closed polystyrene molds but the edges split and tore as the lenses were removed. In addition, they required hand finishing. He was determined to find a better way.
Unfortunately, Wichterle and other prominent teachers had to leave the Institute of Chemical Technology after a political purge staged by its Communist leadership in 1958. Research into contact eye lenses at the Institute of Chemical Technology came to an end. The International Symposium on Macromolecular Chemistry held in Prague in 1957 convinced the state leadership of the need to establish a centre for research into synthetic polymers. The Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (CSAS) came into being in 1958, with Professor Wichterle appointed its director. Since the institute&#x27;s building was under construction at that time, Professor Wichterle conducted the decisive experiments to transform hydrogels into a suitable contact lens shape at his home.

===Early models===
By late 1961 Wichterle succeeded in producing the first four hydrogel contact lenses on a home-made apparatus built using a children&#x27;s building kit (Merkur), a bicycle dynamo belonging to one of his sons, and a bell transformer. Wichterle also made all the moulds and glass tubing needed to dose them with monomer. On Christmas afternoon, with the help of his wife , using the machine on his kitchen table, Wichterle finally succeeded. He tried the lenses in his own eyes and although they were the wrong power they were comfortable. Thus, he invented a new way of manufacturing the lenses using a centrifugal casting procedure. A few days later, he completed his patent application and produced over 100 lenses by spin casting. He built several new prototype machines using Merkur toys, with increasing numbers of spindles which required the stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these rudimentary devices, in the first four months of 1962, Wichterle and Linda made 5,500 lenses. The early experimental lenses were called Geltakt and the later production lenses Spofalens after the state enterprise SPOFA which manufactured them.

===Patent===
In 1965 National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch &amp; Lomb which started to manufacture them in the USA. In 1977 the patents were challenged, mainly by Continuous Curve Contact Lenses and in May 1977 the CSAS sold these patents to avoid any liability if the court case failed. However, Wichterle and NPDC won the court case in 1983.

==Later recognition and Czechoslovakia reform==

Wichterle came to be well-known beyond the frontiers of his country not only through his achievements but also because of his activities in international organizations, chief among which was the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). He took part in the preparations for its Prague symposia in 1957 and 1965, which were much applauded by participants; he had a hand in the inauguration of its fifth, macromolecular, division, of which he was to become the first president, and he gained further credit by combining within it what were for normal administrative purposes the separate fields of pure and applied chemistry.

In 1970, Wichterle was expelled again from his position in the institute, this time for signing &quot;The Two Thousand Words&quot;—a manifesto asking for the continuation of the democratization process begun in 1968 during the Prague Spring. Punishment by the regime included removing him from his executive positions and making his research more and more difficult mainly by cutting off contacts from abroad and limiting his teaching opportunities. Full recognition did not come until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. In 1990, he was made president of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences till the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and was the honorary president of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic after that.

==Honors and achievements==
Wichterle was a member of a number of foreign academies of science, he received many awards and honorary doctorates from several universities. 
*In 1991 Otto Wichterle was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Illinois at Chicago and from the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, NY.
*The asteroid number 3899 was named after Wichterle in 1993.
*A prestigious secondary school in Ostrava (in the district of Poruba) in the Czech Republic was named after him on 1 September 2006.
*On 27 October 2021, Google celebrated Wichterle&#x27;s 108th birth anniversary with a doodle on its homepage.

<text>The sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus), also known as the sharptail or fire grouse, is a medium-sized prairie grouse. One of three species in the genus &quot;Tympanuchus&quot;, the sharp-tailed grouse is found throughout Alaska, much of Northern and Western Canada, and parts of the Western and Midwestern United States. The sharp-tailed grouse is the provincial bird of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

==Taxonomy==
In 1750 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the sharp-tailed grouse in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Long-tailed Grous from Hudson&#x27;s-Bay&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from Hudson Bay by James Isham. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the sharp-tailed grouse with other grouse in the genus &quot;Tetrao&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tetrao phasianellus&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The sharp-tailed grouse is now placed in the genus &quot;Tympanuchus&quot; that was introduced in 1841 by the German zoologist Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger for the greater prairie chicken. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;tumpanon&quot; meaning &quot;kettle-drum&quot; with &quot;ēkheō&quot; meaning &quot;to sound&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;phasianellus&quot; is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;phasianus&quot; meaning &quot;pheasant&quot;.

The greater prairie chicken, lesser prairie chicken, and sharp-tailed grouse make up the genus &quot;Tympanuchus&quot;, a genus of grouse found only in North America. Six extant and one extinct subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse are recognised:
* &quot;T. p. phasianellus&quot;: the nominate race or northern sharp-tailed grouse is found in Manitoba, northern Ontario, and central Quebec. It is partly migratory.
* &quot;T. p. kennicotti&quot;: the northwestern sharp-tailed grouse is resident from the Mackenzie River to the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada.
* &quot;T. p. caurus&quot;: the Alaskan sharp-tailed grouse inhabits north-central Alaska eastwards to the southern Yukon, northern British Columbia, and northern Alberta.
* &quot;T. p. columbianus&quot;: the Columbian sharp-tailed grouse can be found in isolated pockets of native sagebrush and bunchgrass plains of Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and British Columbia.
* &quot;T. p. campestris&quot;: the prairie sharp-tailed grouse lives in Saskatchewan, southeastern Manitoba, southwestern Ontario, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. This subspecies coexists with the plains race around the northern Red River Valley and prefers low seral stages of recently converted forests to shrubland.
* &quot;T. p. jamesi&quot;: the plains sharp-tailed grouse makes its home in the northern Great Plains in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, eastern Montana, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and northeastern Wyoming. This race lives in the mixed-grass prairie, preferring a mosaic of native grasslands, cropland, and brushy/woody riparian draws, creeks, and rivers for a winter food source above the snow cover as buds and berries.
* †&quot;T. p. hueyi&quot;: the New Mexico sharp-tailed grouse is extinct.

==Description==

Adults have a relatively short tail with the two central (deck) feathers being square-tipped and somewhat longer than their lighter, outer tail feathers giving the bird its distinctive name. The plumage is mottled dark and light browns against a white background, they are lighter on the underparts with a white belly uniformly covered in faint V-shaped markings. These markings distinguish sharp-tailed grouse from lesser and greater prairie chickens which are heavily barred on their underparts. Adult males have a yellow comb over their eyes and a violet display patch on their neck. This display patch is another distinguishing characteristic from prairie chickens as male prairie chickens have yellow or orange colored air sacs. The female is smaller than the male and can be distinguished by the regular horizontal markings across the deck feathers as opposed to the irregular markings on the males deck feathers which run parallel to the feather shaft. Females also tend to have less obvious combs.

Measurements:

* Length: 15.0–19.0 in (38.1–48.3 cm)
* Weight: 21.0–31.0 oz (596–880 g)
* Wingspan: 24.4–25.6 in (62–65 cm)

==Distribution==
Sharp-tailed grouse historically occupied eight Canadian provinces and 21 U.S. states pre-European settlement. They ranged from as far north as Alaska, south to California and New Mexico, and east to Quebec, Canada. Following European settlement the sharp-tailed grouse has been extirpated from California, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and New Mexico.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===
These birds forage on the ground in summer, in trees in winter. They eat seeds, buds, berries, forbs, and leaves, also insects, especially grasshoppers, in summer. Specific species of grasshopper the sharp-tailed grouse is known to feed on are &quot;Melanoplus dawsoni&quot; and &quot;Pseudochorthippus curtipennis&quot;.
===Breeding===
The sharp-tailed grouse is a lekking bird species. These birds display in open areas known as leks with other males, anywhere from a single male to upwards of 20 will occupy one lek (averaging 8–12). A lek is an assembly area where animals carry on display and courtship behavior. During the spring, male sharp-tailed grouse attend these leks from March through July with peak attendance in late April, early May. These dates do fluctuate from year to year based on the weather. Johnsgard (2002) observed weather delayed lekking of up to two weeks by sharp-tailed grouse in North Dakota. The males display on the lek by stamping their feet rapidly, about 20 times per second, and rattle their tail feathers while turning in circles or dancing forward. Purple neck sacs are inflated and deflated during display. The males use &quot;cooing&quot; calls also to attract and compete for females. The females select the most dominant one or two males in the center of the lek, copulate, and then leave to nest and raise the young in solitary from the male. Occasionally a low-ranking male may act like a female, approach the dominant male and fight him.

==Habitat selection==
The sharp-tailed grouse is found throughout different prairie ecosystems in North America. They inhabit ecosystems from the pine savannahs of the eastern upper Midwest to the short grass, mid grass, and shrub steppe prairies of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain West. Selection of specific habitat characteristics and vegetation communities is variable among the different subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse. Selection of these specific habitats depends on the quality of habitat available to grouse.
The major habitats used by sharp-tailed grouse, recorded in the literature, are savannah style prairie with grasses dominant and shrub patches mixed throughout, with minimal patches of trees. In fact, Hammerstrom (1963) states the taller the woody vegetation, the less of it there should be in the habitat. The savannah style habitat is mostly preferred during the summer and brood rearing months through autumn. This general habitat is used during all four seasons for different features. Habitat selection and usage vary by season with; lekking, nesting, brood rearing, and winter habitat selected and utilized differently.

===Lekking habitat===
The lek, or dancing ground is, usually made up of short, relatively flat native vegetation. Other habitat types utilized for leks are cultivated lands, recent burns, mowed sites, grazed hill tops, and wet meadows. Manske and Barker (1987) reported sun sedge (&quot;Carex inops&quot;), needle and thread grass (&quot;Hesperostipa comata&quot;), and blue grama (&quot;Bouteloua gracilis&quot;) on lekking grounds in the Sheyenne National Grassland in North Dakota. The males also select for upland or midland habitat type on the tops of ridges or hills. 
Leks surrounded by high residual vegetation were observed by Kirsch et al. (1973). They noticed lek distribution was influenced by the amount of tall residual vegetation adjacent to the lek. Lek sites eventually became abandoned if vegetation structure was allowed to get too high. The invasion of woody vegetation and trees into lekking arenas also caused displaying males to abandon leks. Moyles (1981) observed an inverse relationship of lek attendance by males with an increase in quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) within 0.8 km of arenas in the Alberta parklands. Berger and Baydack (1992) also observed a similar trend in aspen encroachment where 50% (7 of 14) of leks were abandoned when aspen coverage increased to over 56 percent of the total area within 1 km of the lek. Males select hilltops, ridges, or any place with a good field of view for leks. So they can see the surrounding displaying males, approaching females to the dancing ground, and predators.

===Nesting habitat===
Nesting cover is one of the most important habitat types needed by sharp-tailed grouse hens. Nesting habitat varies widely among the different subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse. Hamerstrom Jr. (1939) found the majority of prairie sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;T. p. campestris&quot;) nests occupied dense brush and woods at marsh edges. Gieson and Connelly (1993) reported that Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;T. p. columbianus&quot;) selected for dense shrub stands with taller, denser shrubs located at the nest site. Plains sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;T. p. jamesii&quot;) selected nest sites with dense residual vegetation and a shrubby component. However, nest sites are usually characterized by dense tall residual vegetation (last year’s growth) with the presence of woody vegetation either at the nest site or nearby. Goddard et al. (2009) state that the use of shrub dominated habitats has not been documented by many other researchers. Goddard et al. (2009) found that sharp-tailed grouse hens in Alberta, Canada selected more for shrub steppe habitats in their first nest attempts because of increased concealment provided by the shrubs than the residual grass earlier in the breeding season. Roersma (2001) also found that grouse in southern Alberta selected taller, woody vegetation compared to all other habitats assessed, and grouse used this area in greater proportions to available woody habitat. These findings contradict Prose et al. (2002), who states that residual vegetation is critical to sharp-tailed grouse nest success due to the early seasonal nesting nature of the grouse.

===Brood habitat===
Sharp-tailed grouse are a precocial species, meaning that they hatch with their eyes open, are self-reliant, and do not require the mother to feed them. Shortly after hatching, the chicks and mother leave the nest site in search of cover and food. Brood rearing habitats of sharp-tailed grouse have many characteristics including: shrubby vegetation for concealment, short vegetation nearby for feeding, and high amounts of forbs present. This could explain why sharp-tailed grouse nest in or close to shrub communities. The shrub component in brooding habitat provides good canopy protection from direct sunlight and avian predators. Hamerstrom (1963) and Goddard et al. (2009) both observed the greatest number of sharp-tailed grouse broods present in open, rather than wooded landscapes. Both hypothesized this use of open landscape was due to an abundance of insects for the chicks and green herbaceous cover for the hen to feed on.
Habitat usage by sharp-tailed grouse broods is a function of time of day, available habitat, and weather. Brood habitats are made up of many complex habitat types. Broods may utilize shrubby areas or oak grassland savannah type habitats. Broods utilize these types of habitats for cover, while remaining close to prime foraging habitats in the form of shorter vegetation with a mixture of native vegetation.

===Winter habitat===
Winter habitat usage by sharp-tailed grouse seems to shift toward denser cover for thermal insulation. Hammerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) noticed that grouse use thicker edge type habitat more than the open ground during the winter in Michigan and Wisconsin. Hammerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) also noted that birds, when found in open habitat, were no more than a few hundred meters from thicker cover. These birds were usually utilizing grain fields. Swenson (1985) observed the same trend in Montana. Hamerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) declared that use of forested habitat by sharp-tailed grouse vary by location, noting that sharp-tailed grouse in more semi-arid and arid areas utilize brush less frequently in winter. However, Hammerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) did report that sharp-tailed grouse in Washington and California were observed using edge type habitats more frequently during winter months. Manske and Barker (1987) noticed a similar trend in winter habitat usage in North Dakota, noting that sharp-tailed grouse in small flocks joined together to form larger packs in severe weather. These packs move from open prairie, to shelterbelts, and adjacent croplands with standing corn and sunflowers. Habitat usage in winter varies greatly as a function of snow depth (Swenson 1985). As snow depth increases, habitat selection shifts from cropland and prairie to shelterbelts and woody vegetation. One habitat change seen by Hamerstrom and Hamerstrom (1951), was grouse would select large snow banks to burrow into, to keep warm during cold nights. The use of burrows was also noted by Gratson (1988).

==Habitat fragmentation==
Habitat fragmentation has been one of factors driving the decline of all subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse across its entire range throughout North America. The type of habitat fragmentation varies from ecological succession, as shrub/grassland areas transition into forested areas. Fire suppression, tree plantings, limiting logging practices, and an increase of invasive woody species have also led to habitat fragmentation. The largest contributor to habitat fragmentation has been the agriculture industry.

The Homestead Act 1862 opened up great expanses of virgin prairie in the west to early settlers. By 1905 about 41 million hectares of the west had been homesteaded. Much of this land was in semi-arid rangelands with sub-marginal precipitation to support crop production. The plowing of this land represented a permanent change in the nature of the land. Another contributor to habitat fragmentation for grouse is unmonitored and excessive cattle grazing. Cattle can be an important tool to manage habitat structure for sharp-tailed grouse when managed properly (Evens 1968). The habitat of sharp-tailed grouse was severely affected by early settlers before cattle grazers understood the impact to the environment from overgrazing.

A secondary effect of early agriculture during the years of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s was when homesteaders abandoned the unproductive land. The United States government bought up much of this land through the Land Utilization Program, with management eventually controlled by the United States Forest service and the Bureau of Land Management. During the drought years of the 1930s, these agencies re-vegetated some of these areas with non-native highly competitive vegetation such as smooth brome (&quot;Bromus inermis&quot;) and crested wheatgrass (&quot;Agropyron cristatum&quot;). These plants served their purpose by re-vegetating and protecting the soil. But these invaders became great competitors and directly affected native vegetation. In some instances crested wheatgrass and smooth brome have forced out native vegetation, creating monoculture habitats. Monoculture habitats are not favored by sharp-tailed grouse, as they prefer sites with high heterogeneity. Hamerstrom (1939) was quoted as saying &quot;More important than the individual cover plants is the fact that most of the nests of all species were in cover mixtures rather than pure stands.&quot;

==Habitat assessment==
Research conducted before 1950 on sharp-tailed grouse habitat assessment was done visually. Hamerstrom (1939) reported sparse vegetation was seldom selected for nesting due to lack of adequate cover. Habitat generalizations were formed based on the number of individuals found at a given local. These assumptions were &quot;if&quot; more birds were present at one location and less at another, &quot;then&quot; the first must be the better habitat. Hamerstrom (1963) observed 119 of 207 (57%) grouse broods frequenting savannah style habitat. He concluded that the savannah style habitat was the habitat needed for best management. As the research on habitat for grouse species matured, so did the techniques used for assessment. Cover boards and Robel poles were developed to measure visual obstruction (VO) and create habitat indices. Cover boards were developed as early as 1938 by Wight (1938) to study white-tailed deer habitat. Wight’s (1938) cover board was 6 feet in height, marked and numbered every foot. Visible marks were counted to measure obstruction by plants. Kobriger (1965) developed a 4×4-foot board marked at 3-inch intervals with alternating white and black squares. He placed a camera in the center of the breeding ground at a height of 3 feet. He then placed the cover board 30 feet away taking photographs of the cover board. After compiling all the photographs, they were analyzed with a hand lens to assess the number of squares visible. This number gave him a vegetation index of cover classes. This method has been modified by Limb et al. (2007). Instead of taking photographs 30 feet away like Kobriger (1965), Limb et al. (2007) took photographs of vegetation back-dropped by a 1×1-meter cover board at a height of 1 meter, 4 meters away. These digital photographs were uploaded to Adobe Acrobat and digitized to the 1×1-meter backdrop. Robel et al. (1970) developed a pole to determine height based on correlated vegetation weight. The pole was duly named the Robel pole. Robel et al. (1970) found that VO measurements taken at a height of 1 m and a distance of 4 m from the pole gave a reliable index of the amount of vegetation production at a location. Hamerstrom et al. (1957) were quoted as saying &quot;Height and density of grass were clearly more important to the prairie chickens than species composition&quot; as reported by Robel et al. (1970). This was also believed to be true for the sharp-tailed grouse. These key aspects can now be assessed using the Robel pole, Nudds cover board, and Limb et al. digital photography method effectively and efficiently.

==Management==
It is apparent that the effects of habitat fragmentation across all habitat types selected by sharp-tailed grouse are impacting this species. The management of sharp-tailed grouse habitat has changed over the years from observational (making sure current habitat is maintained) to a more hands on approach. The management of lekking habitat and winter habitat are not as clearly defined in the literature as nesting and brood rearing habitat assessment and management. The development of the Robel pole and cover boards has become a key tool in habitat assessment providing land managers a means to inventory and study habitat preferences based on vegetation structure and density. The Robel pole has become the more favored of the two methods in recent years for habitat assessment. The United States Forest Service (USFS) uses visual obstruction readings (VOR) to set stocking densities for cattle based on the current years standing residual vegetation . This method is currently conducted on the USFS Little Missouri Grasslands, Cheyenne National Grasslands, Cedar River National Grassland, and Grand River National Grassland, all found in the Dakota Prairie National Grasslands in North and South Dakota.

The Robel pole is a non-destructive method for inventorying vegetative biomass. This method was used to create a habitat suitability index based on vegetation visual obstruction (VO), ranging from 0–30.5 cm with a suitability index rating of 0–1.0. Studies of nesting habitat by Prose et al. (2002) in the Nebraska Sandhills found that nesting sharp-tailed grouse selected nest sites with visual obstruction readings (VOR) of more than 4 cm. Similarly, Clawson and Rottella (1998) observed that 58% of nests (432 of 741) in Southwestern Montana were located in sites with an average VOR of 24 cm. The other nests in this study were located in sites with VOR’s of 11–18 cm. Reece et al. (2001) observed that sites with a VO of less than 5 cm near possible nesting locations indicated a decline in quality nesting habitat as average VO declined. The use of the Robel pole to assess habitat for sharp-tailed grouse has given managers a target height of vegetation structure to have at the end of the grazing season. This allows managers to set the appropriate stocking rate to best attain a desired vegetation height. As a rule of thumb, the average VOR reading for suitable grouse nesting habitat is 3.5in (8.89 cm). Lekking habitat can be managed by burning, mowing, clear cutting, and grazing across the entire range of the sharp-tailed grouse subspecies. Ammann (1957) found that leks that contained woody vegetation did not exceed 30% of the total lek area. Similarly, Moyles (1989) found a negative correlation with increased in aspen trees (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) on lekking sites and the number of displaying males present. Trees may provide perches for avian predators but further work needs to be done on the effects of woody plant encroachment.

<doc id="515179" wikidata="Q1681197" url="?curid=515179" title="Königsaue">
<text>The town of Königsaue in the district Aschersleben-Staßfurt, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany was destroyed in the course of opencast lignite mining in 1964. The inhabitants were resettled to the town of Neu-Königsaue, ca. 1 km north of the former location.

==Palaeolithic site==
Königsaue is also a middle palaeolithic find spot. 
It dates to about 80.000 BP, the Eemian (Ipswichian) interglacial. The site most probably was a seasonal hunting camp at the shore of lake Aschersleben that was completely drained at the beginning of the 18th century by an order of Friedrich II. It was discovered in 1963 by Dieter Mania during rescue excavations in the course of lignite mining (opencast mine Königsaue 1, 1918–1977) in a depth of 17 m.

==Stratigraphy==
Three settlement layers can be distinguished, separated by limnic sediments. The first layer (A) is dated to the beginning of the interstadial. The vegetation is still turning to boreal, an open steppe type habitat, the pollen assemblage dominated by grasses.
Layer C coincides with the climatic optimum. Tree pollen rise to 70%, birch and pine dominate.

==Finds==
Ca. 6000 flints have been excavated, including a few bifacially worked knives (Keilmesser) and small pointed hand axes of Micoquien type (Faustkeilblätter). The bifacial tools are most common in layer A, while prepared cores are typical for layer B. Numerous unretouched blades and small debitage point to intense local tool production. The site may have been used as a base camp. In layer C bifacial tools again predominate.
Layers A and C belong to the Micoquien, B to the Mousterian.
Animal bones show that Mammoth, woolly haired rhino, horses, red deer and reindeer were hunted. Some pieces of worked wood have been preserved as well.

==Pitch==
The most famous finds from Königsaue are two pieces of birch-pitch (layers A and B), one of which shows the partial finger-print of a Neanderthal. It shows the impression of a piece of wood as well and was thus used for hafting a composite tool. It is the oldest evidence for the use of chemical processes (dry destillation) up to now (=2004).
The pieces are black, of a longish shape and show traces of kneading. Chemical analysis (gas-chromatography) confirm the identification as birch-pitch (presence of betulin).
The bigger piece shows impressions of a retouched stone artefact and of a split piece of wood, most probably a wooden haft of a bifacial tool. There are weak traces of finger-prints, but the whorl-pattern could not be identified.

<text>Herbert Danby (20 January 1889 – 29 March 1953) was an Anglican priest and writer who played a central role in the change of attitudes toward Judaism in the first half of the twentieth century.

== Education ==
Danby was educated at Church Middle Class School, Leeds and Keble College, Oxford. He was a Holroyd Musical Scholar, and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1907. He retained a lifelong passionate interest in music, and also in golf.

Danby had a distinguished career at Oxford, winning the Junior Septuagint Prize, the Pusey and Ellerton Scholarship, the Houghton Syriac Prize and a Senior Kennicott Scholarship. He achieved a first class degree in Oriental Languages, and was awarded an MA in 1914. His studies continued after he started work, and he was made a Doctor of Divinity in 1923, partly for his translation &quot;Tractate Sanhedrin, Mishna and Tosefta&quot;, published in 1919.

== Early career ==
Danby became a Deacon in 1913, and worked as Curate of the Parish of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire. Ordained as a priest in 1914, he became Subwarden of St Deiniol&#x27;s Library, Hawarden, Flintshire, 1914-9.

== Jerusalem ==
In 1919, Danby moved to Jerusalem to become Librarian of St. George&#x27;s Cathedral. He was Residentiary Canon there, 1921–36. From 1923, he was Dean of the Palestine Board of Higher Studies and The Times Correspondent for Palestine and Transjordan. From 1928, he was Examining Chaplain to the Bishop of Jerusalem.

He was editor of the Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society from 1920, and President of that Society in 1934. He engaged in the study of Jewish literature, and published his English translation of the Mishnah in 1933, the first ever complete translation of the Mishnah into English. He also translated a remarkable work by Joseph Klausner entitled &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;.

== Oxford ==
In 1936, he returned to Oxford as Regius Professor of Hebrew and Canon of Christ Church. He was Grinfield Lecturer on the Septuagint, 1939–43, Examining Chaplain to the Bishop of Monmouth, 1939–41 and Treasurer of Christ Church Cathedral from 1943.

He assisted in the Yale Translation of the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides.

His contributions to the decline of antisemitism in intellectual circles in the twentieth century was very significant. He was at work revising his translation of Maimonides&#x27; Book of Cleanness when he finally succumbed to his fatal illness. Among his close friends were Professor Godfrey Rolles Driver of Oxford University and Rabbi Dr. Isidore Epstein of Jews&#x27; College, London.

<text>Kerry Lyn Jones (born 19 April 1956) is the current executive director of the Constitution Education Fund Australia (CEFA).

Following a Bachelor of Music in 1977 and a Diploma of Education in 1978, Jones taught music in Sydney high schools. In 1985 she was appointed by the NSW Education Department as Performing Arts Consultant (K-12) for the Riverina Region. Her work included teacher training and syllabus implementation, bi-centenary and other special music projects such as regional bands and choirs, and special arts projects including working with indigenous Australians on the far west border of NSW. She later completed a Master of Educational Administration.

From 1990 to 1993, Jones was chief executive officer of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals.

In 1994 Jones was appointed executive director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy following The Hon. Tony Abbott stepping down from the post, due to being elected to the Federal Parliament. In 1998 she was elected as a member of the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998. As leader of ACM, she defended the Australian Constitution, saying &quot;no republic model will ever offer the protection and safeguards that work so well in our current Constitution&quot;. She said her task was to &quot;assess each republican model against the Constitution that has served us so well&quot;. She told the convention:

In 1999 she was appointed by the Federal Government to chair the “No Case Committee” for the 1999 Australian republic referendum, ultimately leading the “No Case” to a successful result. By leading the campaign against a Republic, Jones became a public figure and was awarded a Centenary Medal in 2000.

In 2001 Jones was appointed executive director of the Constitution Education Fund Australia (CEFA). Devoted to nonpartisan Civics, Citizenship and Values Education Programs, Projects and Awards the CEFA charity empowers young Australians to become knowledgeable, responsible and engaged participants in the Australian community. Kerry sees her community work with CEFA as vital for the future of an informed and vibrant Australian democracy. Kerry now devotes her full-time work to this community cause and sees her primary life work as an educationalist.

Jones is the publisher and editor of &quot;Aboriginal Arts in Transition&quot; (1989), &quot;The No Case Papers&quot; (1999), &quot;The Australian Constitutional Monarchy&quot; (1994), &quot;The ACM Handbook&quot; (1996) and &quot;The People&#x27;s Protest&quot; (2000).

<doc id="515203" wikidata="Q7998455" url="?curid=515203" title="Wicksteed Park">
<text>Wicksteed Park is a Grade II listed park in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, which includes an amusement park within its grounds. The park is located in the south-east of Kettering, on the western edge of Barton Seagrave village. The park is owned by the Wicksteed Charitable Trust, with the amusement park being run by its trading subsidiary company Wicksteed Park Ltd (replaced by Wicksteed Trading Ltd after going into administration in 2020).

==Foundation==
The park was founded by Charles Wicksteed, a wealthy industrialist who owned the engineering works of Charles Wicksteed &amp; Co. Ltd in Kettering. In 1913 he purchased the meadowland, which was part of the Barton Seagrave Hall estate, with the intention of building a model village for his workers, to be called the Barton Seagrave Garden Suburb Estate. The Wicksteed Village Trust was set up to run the enterprise. After World War I, when local authorities were building public housing, Wicksteed decided instead to create a park with leisure facilities for local people, with refreshments and attractions, for which a modest charge was made, funding the provision of a free playground and sporting facilities.

The first playground equipment, manufactured by Wicksteed&#x27;s company, had been installed in 1917 and an artificial lake fed by the Ise Brook was constructed in 1921, with the park officially opened that year. By 1926 the park had a pavilion and theatre building, a rose garden, a water chute, bandstand, and fountain. The water chute was designed by Charles Wicksteed and a few years later was given a new roof. Barton Seagrave Hall was purchased by Charles Wicksteed in 1928. In 1931 a railway track was built around the edge of the lake. Charles Wicksteed died in 1931 and the Wicksteed Village Trust continued his work, adding features and facilities to the park.

==Development==
The park continued to develop during the 1930s with the addition of a golf course, toy shop and aviary. A tunnel was added to the railway. The park attracted a record 40,000 visitors on August bank holiday Monday in 1935. During World War II the park remained partially open, with American troops billeted in the pavilion. Improvement continued in the 1950s, with the opening of a cinema, a miniature car track, a pets corner and an ice cream factory. In 1969 a new office and administration block was built. The 1970s saw the addition of a nature trail, a skateboarding rink and a ferris wheel. In April 1980 the park played host to the &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; television programme and also added the iconic double pirate ship. Attendance had fallen during the 1970s but had recovered to an annual 750,000 visitors by 1982. Two roller coasters, nautic jets, a cup and saucer ride and a pedal cycle monorail were added during the 1990s.

==Twenty-first century==
A mascot for the park, Wicky Bear, was acquired in 2000. The park hosts the local weekly parkrun and an annual fireworks display. During the display in November 2005, eleven people were injured in an accident when a firework shot into the crowd.

In 2012 the park received over £1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards the cost of restoration of the lake. Northamptonshire County Council and Kettering Borough Council also helped fund the work, which was completed in 2014. Barton Seagrave Hall was sold in 2012 to help fund the park.

In 2013 the BBC Children in Need event for BBC East was held here and had one of the choirs shown on the nationwide Children in Need Choir

On &quot;The Great Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off&quot; in 2019, comedian James Acaster made a baked replica of Wicksteed Park for his Showstopper challenge.

In 2016 the water chute at Wicksteed Park was given Grade II listed building status. At the end of the 2016 season, Wicksteed Park made the decision to close the double pirate ship due to high maintenance costs. The ride was sold to a businessman from Bulgaria.

Wicksteed Park was awarded a further £1.78 million by the National Lottery Heritage Fund in 2018 for a project to preserve the park&#x27;s history.

In March 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic forced the closure of the attractions in the park, and in June 2020 Wicksteed Park Ltd announced that it had gone into administration. An appeal to save the amusement park raised £130,000 in donations from the public and £247,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. A new company, Wicksteed Trading Ltd, was set up and bought most of the park&#x27;s assets. The outdoor space was reopened in July 2020, with attractions and rides starting to open in the spring of 2021. An official reopening was scheduled for May 2021.

==Wicksteed Park Railway==

The narrow-gauge Wicksteed Park railway is one of the features of the park. Over 15 million people have taken to its rails since it first opened in 1931. It was the last feature of the park to be added during the lifetime of the park&#x27;s founder Charles Wicksteed and is supported by the Friends of the Wicksteed Park Railway.

<doc id="515211" wikidata="Q1537591" url="?curid=515211" title="Goodrich Corporation">
<text>The Goodrich Corporation, formerly the B.F. Goodrich Company, was an American manufacturing company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in Akron, Ohio in 1870 as Goodrich, Tew &amp; Co. by Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich, the company name was changed to the &quot;B.F. Goodrich Company&quot; in 1880, to BFGoodrich in the 1980s, and to &quot;Goodrich Corporation&quot; in 2001. Originally a rubber manufacturing company known for automobile tires, the company diversified its manufacturing businesses throughout the twentieth century and sold off its tire business in 1986 to focus on its other businesses, such as aerospace and chemical manufacturing. The BFGoodrich brand name continues to be used by Michelin, who acquired the tire manufacturing business in 1988. Following the acquisition by United Technologies in 2012, Goodrich became a part of UTC Aerospace Systems.

In 1869, Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Dr. Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio, to relocate his business there.

The company grew to be one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world, helped in part by the 1986 merger with Uniroyal (formerly the &quot;United States Rubber Company&quot;). This product line was sold to Michelin in 1988, and more than a decade later the company merged with Rohr (1997), Coltec Industries, and TRW Aeronautical Systems (formerly Lucas Aerospace) in 2002. The sale of the specialty chemicals division and subsequent change to the current name completed the transformation. In 2006, company sales were $5.8 billion, of which 18%, 16% and 12% of total revenues were accounted for by the U.S. government, Airbus and Boeing, respectively.

In 1988, the Goodrich Corporation sold its tire business and rights to the Goodrich name to French company Michelin. During the 1970s, Goodrich ran television and print ads to distinguish themselves from the similar-sounding Goodyear tire company. The tag line was, &quot;We&#x27;re the other guys. Remember?&quot; The company was also sometimes confused with Mr. Goodwrench as the two last names were similar, especially since B.F. Goodrich tires were featured on many General Motors cars and trucks.

==History==

===Early history===
In 1869 Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio, to relocate his business there.

In 1909, the company constructed a 12-story building with a facade influenced by Jacobean Revival style and Vienna Secession for its New York Headquarters, located at 1780 Broadway, New York. which is now become one of the historical landmarks.

In March 1912, the Diamond Rubber Company, founded by the owner of the Diamond Match Company, was bought out by and merged with the B.F. Goodrich Company. The Diamond brand name and product line were retained and a subsidiary Diamond Rubber Company created for the marketing and manufacturing of them.

The company helped found and start the Yokohama Rubber Company on Oct 13, 1917, in a joint venture between Yokohama Cable Manufacturing and B.F. Goodrich.

B.F. Goodrich sold radios from the 1930s to the 1950s, under the brand name &quot;Mantola&quot;. These radios were actually made by a variety of manufacturers for B.F. Goodrich.

In 1936, the company entered the Mexican market in a joint venture, Goodrich-Euzkadi (now part of Continental AG).

Goodrich ranked 67th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

The Troy, Ohio plant was purchased in 1946 from Waco. Since then, Goodrich has manufactured wheels and brakes for a variety of aircraft. Among these are commercial, military, regional, and business programs. This successful operation lies at the core of Goodrich&#x27;s business. Competitors include the aerostructures divisions of companies such as Honeywell, Messier-Bugatti, Aircraft Braking Systems, (Howmet/Huck) and SNECMA. The Hood Rubber Company was sold before the Great Depression as a division of the B.F. Goodrich Company.

===1980–1990s===
By 1986, B.F. Goodrich had become an S&amp;P 500-listed company in diverse business, including tire and rubber fabrication. B.F. Goodrich made high-performance replacement tires. In August 1986, one of its biggest competitors in the tire business, Uniroyal Inc., was taken private when it merged with the tire segment of the B.F. Goodrich Company, in a joint venture private partnership, to become the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company. B.F. Goodrich Company held a 50% stake in the new tire company.

The new Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company headquarters was established at the former B.F. Goodrich corporate headquarters, within its 27-building downtown complex in Akron, Ohio which contained Goodrich&#x27;s original factory. In the autumn of 1987 B.F. Goodrich Company shut down several manufacturing operations at the site, and most of the complex remained vacant until February 1988, when B.F. Goodrich announced plans to sell the vacant part of the complex to the Covington Capital Corporation, a group of New York developers. The complex is now known as Canal Place.

In 1987, its first full year of operation, the new Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company generated almost $2 billion in sales revenue, with profits of $35 million.

The merger soon proved to be difficult. In June 1988 B.F. Goodrich sold its 50% stake for $225 million. The buyers were a group of investors led by Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice a private New York investment firm. At the same time, B.F. Goodrich also received a warrant to purchase indirectly up to 7% of the equity in Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company.

As part of the June 1988 sale deal, the new privately held tire company acquired publicly held debt of $415 million.

Also in 1988, Michelin Group, a subsidiary of the French tire company Michelin et Cie proposed to acquire the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company and took actions towards acquiring a stake. By May 1990, Michelin Group had completed its buyout of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company from Clayton &amp; Dubilier of New York. The deal was valued at about US$1.5 billion. B.F. Goodrich surrendered its 7% warrant to Michelin Group, and received $32.5 million additional revenue from the sale.

===Leaving tire business===

B.F. Goodrich by then exited the tire business entirely, in line with its plan to build its chemicals and aerospace businesses through reinvestment and acquisitions. In 1997, it acquired Rohr, a maker of jet aircraft engine nacelles, expanding its presence in integrated aircraft components industry.

In 1999, it acquired Charlotte, North Carolina–based Coltec Industries for $2.2 billion in stock and assumed debt, making the former tire maker the No. 1 supplier of landing gear and other aircraft parts. Headquarters were moved to Charlotte following this merger.

In 2001, the company divested its specialty chemicals business to focus on aerospace and industrial products and, to signify the completion of its transformation, it was renamed Goodrich Corporation and adopted a new logo.

In October 2002, Goodrich acquired TRW Aeronautical Systems, this division was mainly the former Lucas Aerospace activity, mostly based in the UK and France.

In November 2010, Goodrich opened a large new manufacturing centre in Krosno Rzeszow, Poland.

===Fate===
In September 2011, United Technologies Corporation announced a deal to buy Goodrich for $18.4 billion, paying $127.50 per share and assuming $1.9 billion in debt.

On July 26, 2012, United Technologies Corporation purchased Goodrich. Unsold divisions of Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich were then merged to create UTC Aerospace Systems. Rocketdyne, Hamilton Sundstrand&#x27;s industrial pumps and compressors operations, Clipper Windpower, and UTC Power (United Technologies&#x27; fuel-cell business) would be sold off to raise cash for the deal.
On October 16, 2012, United Technologies Corporation secured an agreement to sell the Power Systems division of Goodrich (Twinsburg Ohio, Pitstone Green Buckinghamshire) to Safran for $400 million. The sale of this business unit was a condition that the Chinese competition regulators set in approving UTC&#x27;s purchase of Goodrich. The Power Systems division had to be divested by December 16, 2012. Ultimately, the sale was completed on 27 March 2013.
In April 2020, the remaining portions of Goodrich became part of the Collins Aerospace subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies, a firm which resulted from the merger of United Technologies and the Raytheon Company.

<text>Earthquake is a 1974 American ensemble disaster drama film directed and produced by Mark Robson and starring Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner. The plot concerns the struggle for survival after a catastrophic earthquake destroys most of Los Angeles.

Directed by Robson with a screenplay by George Fox and Mario Puzo, the film starred a large cast of well-known actors, including Heston, Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Geneviève Bujold, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner, Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Victoria Principal, and (under an alias) Walter Matthau. It is notable for the use of an innovative sound effect called Sensurround, which created the sense of actually experiencing an earthquake in theaters.

==Plot==
Former college football star Stewart Graff argues with his wife, Remy, after she fakes another suicide attempt following a mild earthquake in Los Angeles. Furious, Graff visits Denise Marshall, a part-time actress and widow of a colleague who died on a project Graff assigned him. Feeling obligated to help Denise and her 10-year-old son, Corry, Graff brings the boy an autographed football from his college days and helps Denise rehearse for an upcoming film.

Officer Lew Slade pursues a car thief but is intercepted by a rival deputy after crossing jurisdictional lines. The two, already enemies, clash, and Slade punches the deputy, resulting in his suspension.

At the California Seismological Institute (CSI), junior seismologist Walter Russell predicts a major earthquake within two days. Head seismologist Dr. Stockle and associate Dr. Johnson agree with his assessment and notify the mayor. Concerned about political repercussions, the mayor alerts only the National Guard and police.

Motorcycle daredevil Miles Quade sets up a dangerous stunt track with his manager, Sal Amici, hoping to impress a Las Vegas promoter. Sal&#x27;s sister, Rosa, fears for Miles’ safety and refuses to promote the stunt. Meanwhile, grocery store manager Jody Joad, attracted to Rosa, prepares for National Guard duty but endures harassment from his housemates for displaying posters of male bodybuilders.

A small tremor cancels Denise’s film shoot, leading her to meet her friend Barbara at Graff’s engineering firm. Denise and Graff cross paths and return to her home, where they have sex for the first time. Graff asks Denise to join him in Oregon that summer with Corry while he works on a hydroelectric dam project.

Later, Graff’s boss and father-in-law, Sam Royce, offers him the company presidency. Graff, conflicted between the promotion and his relationship with Denise, accepts the offer after discovering Remy convinced Sam to save their marriage. Enraged, Graff admits to the affair and ends their marriage.

A 9.9 earthquake devastates Los Angeles, trapping Sam and others in a skyscraper. Sam helps his staff escape using a firehose but suffers a heart attack. Graff rescues him and takes him to safety.

Corry is thrown from a collapsing footbridge into the Los Angeles River, becoming entangled in live cables. Denise rescues him but becomes trapped. Miles and Sal arrive in a truck, saving them and meeting Slade, who commandeers the vehicle to transport the injured. Miles uses his motorcycle to search for Rosa.

Rosa is mistakenly arrested for looting by Jody’s National Guard unit. Jody isolates her under false pretenses and later murders his housemates, using the chaos as cover for personal revenge. Graff, transporting co-workers, drops off Remy, Barbara, and Sam at Wilson Plaza, but Sam dies despite medical aid. Graff departs to find Denise and Corry.

Slade commandeers Graff’s car to transport the injured but struggles with the manual transmission, forcing Graff to drive. They encounter Jody’s unit blocking the road. Rosa escapes the store, screaming for help, prompting Slade to return on foot. Slade kills Jody, saving Rosa.

An aftershock destroys Wilson Plaza before Graff and Slade arrive. Graff learns survivors, including Denise and Corry, are trapped in the underground garage. Ignoring advice, Graff and Slade drill through to rescue them. The Mulholland Dam collapses, flooding the area. Denise, Corry, and Dr. Vance escape, but Remy falls into the torrent. Graff dives after her, and both are swept away and drown.

Slade escapes and searches for Graff but finds no trace. Denise, grieving, reunites with Corry. Slade and Rosa survey the devastated city as stunned survivors wander through the ruins. Fires rage as Los Angeles smolders in the aftermath.

==Production==
===Inception===
In the wake of the tremendous success of the 1970 disaster-suspense film &quot;Airport&quot;, Universal Studios began working with executive producer Bernard Donnenfeld and director John Sturges to come up with a new idea that would work within the same &quot;disaster-suspense&quot; genre. Inspiration came in the form of the San Fernando earthquake of February 1971. Universal was intrigued by the idea of creating a disaster on film that would not be confined to an airliner, but rather take place over a large area.

Donnenfeld and Sturges left the project early in 1972, and Universal executive producer Jennings Lang took over development, bringing Mark Robson aboard as producer and director.

===Development===
Lang scored a coup when he was able to sign screenwriter Mario Puzo, who was paid $125,000 to write the first draft during the summer of 1972. Puzo, fresh from the success of his novel and film, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, delivered the draft script in August. However, Puzo&#x27;s detailed and expansive script would have necessitated a larger production budget, as the action and multiple story arcs were spread over a vast geographical area in Los Angeles. Universal was faced with either cutting the script or increasing the projected budget. Puzo&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Earthquake&quot; was short-lived, as Paramount Pictures was anxious to begin development with the followup to &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; in early 1973. Because Puzo&#x27;s services contractually were obligated to the sequel, he was unable to continue any further work on &quot;Earthquake&quot;.

The &quot;Earthquake&quot; script sat at Universal Studios for a short period, but was brought back to life by the huge success of the 20th Century Fox hit &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, released in December 1972. Fueled by that film&#x27;s enormous box-office receipts, Universal Studios put pre-production on &quot;Earthquake&quot; back into high gear, hiring writer George Fox to continue work with Puzo&#x27;s first draft. Fox was principally a magazine writer and never had written a screenplay, so director Mark Robson worked with him to narrow the scope of the script to fit into the budgetary constraints. After 11 drafts, &quot;Earthquake&quot; went before the cameras in February 1974. Since Robson was also tasked with producing such a technically complex film, Bernard Donnenfeld was brought back to co-produce, but was uncredited.

Budgeted at US$6,675,125, &quot;Earthquake&quot; immediately found itself in a race against the clock with the bigger-budgeted disaster film, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, which was being produced by Irwin Allen and financed, for the first time, by two studios (20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.).

===Casting===
While &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; featured a larger &quot;all star&quot; cast, Universal was able to land Charlton Heston in the lead role for the sum of $600,000, plus a percentage of the profits. Rounding out the top billing were Ava Gardner (who co-starred with Heston in 1963&#x27;s &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;), George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, and Geneviève Bujold. Richard Roundtree (riding a wave of success from the &quot;Shaft&quot; film series) was brought in after filming had already started, filling the part of an Evel Knievel-like motorcycle stuntman. Former evangelical preacher Marjoe Gortner was hired as the antagonist, Jody. Relative unknown Victoria Principal was hired to play the sister of Roundtree&#x27;s business partner, Sal, played by veteran actor Gabriel Dell.

Walter Matthau was cast in a cameo role, for which he was credited as &quot;Walter Matuschanskayasky&quot;. Executive Producer Jennings Lang, who had worked with Matthau on the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Charley Varrick&quot;, was able to convince him to appear in the role (originally to be filled by veteran actor Harry Morgan). The unpaid cameo - and his credited name - were part of the deal.

===Set design===
Production necessitated the complete re-dressing of the entire Universal Studios &quot;New York Street&quot; backlot in order to simulate the catastrophic earthquake of the title. Along with a clever use of miniatures of actual buildings, matte paintings, and full-scale sets (some of which were placed on rollers for a shaking effect), &quot;Earthquake&quot; used a new technique developed especially for the film: a &quot;shaker mount&quot; camera system that mimicked the effects of an earthquake by moving the entire camera body several inches side to side, versus simple shaking the camera on a stationary tripod, for a more realistic motion. This camera mount was used for most exterior scenes or other instances where shooting on location.

===Stunts===
Extensive use of highly trained stunt artists for the most dangerous scenes involving high falls, dodging falling debris, and flood sequences, set a Hollywood record for the most stunt artists involved in any film production up until that time: 141. Major stunt sequences in the film required careful choreography between the stunt artists and behind-the-scenes stunt technicians who were responsible for triggering full-scale effects, such as falling debris. Timing was critical, since some rigged effects involved dropping six ton chunks of reinforced concrete in order to flatten cars, with stunt performers only a few feet away. In other scenarios, some stunt artists were required to fall onto large air bags from the rafters of Universal&#x27;s largest stage (Stage 12) – for which they were paid the sum of $500. While every precaution was taken to prevent injuries, several did occur during filming. One stunt person suffered a concussion during the flood sequence (the accident was used in the film), and several stunt artists were injured during the elevator crash scene, since the set was designed to collapse upon them. Multiple stunt artists were injured during a scene involving an escalator as well.

===&quot;Sensurround&quot;===
Universal Studios and Jennings Lang wanted &quot;Earthquake&quot; to be an &quot;event film&quot;, something that would draw audiences into the theatre multiple times. After several ideas were tossed about (which included bouncing styrofoam faux &quot;debris&quot; over audience members&#x27; heads), Universal&#x27;s sound department came up with a process called &quot;Sensurround&quot; – a series of large speakers made by Cerwin-Vega powered by BGW amplifiers, that would pump in sub-audible &quot;infra bass&quot; sound waves at 120 decibels (equivalent to a jet airplane at takeoff), giving the viewer the sensation of an earthquake. The process was tested in several theatres around the United States prior to the film&#x27;s release, yielding various results. A famous example is Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, where the &quot;Sensurround&quot; cracked the plaster in the ceiling. The same theatre premiered &quot;Earthquake&quot; three months later – with a newly installed net over the audience to catch any falling debris – to tremendous success.

Sensurround was used again for the films &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1977), and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1979).

The 2006 Universal Studios Home Entertainment DVD release features the original &quot;Sensurround&quot; 3.1 audio track, duplicating the original theatrical &quot;Sensurround&quot; track (but oddly in mono directed to the front 3 speakers rather than the original stereo mix), but no actual &#x27;rumble&#x27; generator was used, and only the two control tones that activated the generator can be heard. In addition, the film&#x27;s original soundtrack was remixed in Surround Sound 5.1 which was simply a tag as once again only the control tones feature on the track.

===Music===
John Williams&#x27; music for &quot;Earthquake&quot; was the second of his trio of scores for large-scale disaster films, having previously scored &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; and following with &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. Williams scored &quot;Earthquake&quot; and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; during the summer of 1974, with both scores showing similarities to one another (notably &quot;Earthquake&#x27;s&quot; theme and &quot;The Towering Inferno&#x27;s&quot; love theme sharing the same eight-note melody, albeit in different keys). The music of the song &quot;C&#x27;est si Bon&quot; by Henri Betti is played on the guitar in the middle of the film.

On December 10, 2019, La-La Land Records released a fully remastered and expanded version of Williams&#x27; music, as part of the &quot;Disaster Movie Soundtrack Collection&quot;, which includes the remastered expansions of Williams&#x27;s music for this film, as well as &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; and &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;.

===Audience preview and re-edits===
After an October 2, 1974 test screening in Joplin, Missouri, Universal opted to cut 30 minutes from the film, notably from the pre-quake sequences, at the cost of some of the dramatic flow. This included a narration sequence about the San Andreas fault and an impending catastrophic earthquake that would occur in either Los Angeles or San Francisco. This scene was filmed and was set to be shown before the opening title credits (although it was removed at the last minute, it was eventually included as the opening sequence of the NBC television edit for the September, 1976 broadcast premiere). Also excised were lengthy scenes of Remy and Graff arguing at the beginning of the film. After Remy&#x27;s faked suicide attempt, Dr. Vance (Lloyd Nolan) inadvertently informs his old friend Graff that Remy had an abortion two years prior (he was told it was a miscarriage). Angered because he wanted children, Graff storms off. There was more of Slade&#x27;s leaving the police station, and footage of Rosa&#x27;s leaving the market was shot as well. She was filmed waiting for a bus and being offered a lift from a man on a motorcycle (this footage eventually was used in the film&#x27;s television cut). Just before the earthquake, Stewart and Remy had a final fight (in front of Stewart&#x27;s car) that was deleted as well. During the earthquake, there was a scene of a nearby lumberyard falling apart, and this was removed from the final cut.

Other scenes were shot to wrap up many characters&#x27; stories after the earthquake, but were deleted from the final print: Walt Russell and Dr. Stockle – whose fates are undetermined after the quake in the theatrical release – were shown alive in the seismology laboratory post-quake. They were shown finding the earthquake&#x27;s magnitude to be 9.9 on the Richter scale. The film&#x27;s final scene was significantly re-edited, and originally showed Denise walking up to Lew Slade as he emerges from the manhole, and asks if Stewart had survived; upon hearing of his death, she walks over to Corry who has regained consciousness.

===The elevator scene===
A scene involving an elevator loaded with passengers plummeting 25 floors to the ground during the earthquake is one of the film&#x27;s more notorious sequences, mainly for how its conclusion was depicted. As originally scripted, the occupants were pressed to the ceiling of the elevator as it fell down the shaft, and then dropped to the floor when the elevator crashes to the bottom. To film this, an elevator set was built suspended several feet over the stage floor, allowing for the dropping of the set (with the stunt people inside). The scene was filmed several times, with several stunt people involved. Copious amounts of stage blood were rigged to spray the stunt people inside the elevator set with blood when the set came crashing to the ground. After several tries over two separate filming days weeks apart (the break in filming was an attempt to perfect the mechanical effects involved), and with unsatisfactory results, the decision was made to edit the scene with an &quot;animated blood&quot; effect to be added in post production. The optical effect was superimposed over a still frame of part of the unusable footage, resulting in the &quot;cartoonish&quot; nature of the shot. The television version removed the animated blood sequence.

== Reception ==

Released in the United States on November 15, 1974, &quot;Earthquake&quot; ranked third among the high-grossing film of the year; &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; was the highest.

===Box office===
&quot;Earthquake&quot; grossed $1,306,271 in its opening weekend from 62 theatres in 51 cities in the United States and Canada. It eventually grossed $79.7 million in the United States and Canada ($450.5 million, adjusted for inflation in 2023 dollars) being one of the highest-grossing films of the time. Internationally, it grossed $87.7 million, including () in Japan, bringing its worldwide gross to .

===Critical response===
At its release, critics generally acknowledged the special effects in &quot;Earthquake&quot; while discounting other aspects. Without either panning or praising the film, Nora Sayre of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that it was an improvement on &quot;Airport 1975&quot; and observed, &quot;The impulse to shout advice to the screen—get out! go away! don&#x27;t enter that building—is quite powerful, so this does rank as a participatory movie.&quot; Judith Crist wrote in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; that &quot;the nonsense is bearable for the spectacle. And ... here we have a feast of feats of destruction.&quot; Pauline Kael wrote &quot;The picture is swill, but it isn&#x27;t a cheat; it&#x27;s an entertaining marathon of Grade-A destruction effects&quot;. Roger Ebert criticized the &quot;witless &quot;Earthquake&quot;&quot; for &quot;regarding [the effects] with awe&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote the special effects were &quot;terrific&quot; but identified a basic problem with the story: &quot;With a &quot;Poseidon Adventure&quot; or an &quot;Airport&quot; the ending is clear people are saved ultimately thru their own or somebody else&#x27;s enterprise. But with an earthquake, the final solution is out of one&#x27;s hands, anyone&#x27;s hands even Allstate&#x27;s. If the tremors don&#x27;t stop, then everybody&#x27;ll die; if they do, then only a few people will die. End of story.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the Sensurround vibrations &quot;succeed very nicely in making themselves felt as well as heard and they set up an anxiety which makes watching &#x27;Earthquake&#x27; a very ambivalent experience for anyone who, so to speak, has been there before.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;Thanks to Sensurround, &#x27;Earthquake&#x27; figures to be the gimmick hit of 1974. Without the gimmick, it would be difficult to distinguish this perfunctory, mediocre piece of storytelling from Universal&#x27;s other disaster vehicle, &quot;Airport 1975.&quot;&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 44% from 32 reviews with an average score of 4.90 out of 10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The destruction of Los Angeles is always a welcome sight, but &quot;Earthquake&quot; offers little besides big actors slumming through crumbling sets.&quot; Metacritic, who uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 56/100 based on 6 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Leonard Maltin gave the film a &quot;BOMB&quot; rating, stating &quot;[the] title tells the story in hackneyed disaster epic ... Marjoe as a sex deviate and Gardner as Lorne Greene&#x27;s daughter tie for film&#x27;s top casting honors.&quot; Gardner was only 8 years younger than Lorne Greene.

===Accolades===
&quot;Earthquake&quot; became a blockbuster success and was nominated for four Academy Awards (winning one) and receiving a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated

==Television version==
For the film&#x27;s television premiere on Sunday, September 26, 1976 on NBC, additional footage was added to expand the film&#x27;s running time so it could be aired over two nights, as part of NBC&#x27;s promotion of &quot;The Big Event&quot; fall premiere series (the second night aired on Sunday, October 3, 1976).

According to internal memos from Universal Studios, both Jennings Lang and Mark Robson were upset that Universal and NBC had agreed to alter the original film for its premiere broadcast, with Robson initially refusing to participate (but eventually relenting to be a &quot;consultant&quot; to the editing process). Editor Gene Palmer was hired to direct the additional footage, with a script provided by an uncredited Francesca Turner. Robson petitioned the Directors Guild of America that it was specified he was the director of the &quot;theatrical version only&quot; (which was granted).

While inserting approximately 30 minutes of unused footage shot for the theatrical version was considered, this &quot;television version&quot; made virtually no use of material edited out of the theatrical release (save the introductory sequence describing earthquakes in California on the San Andreas Fault, and one brief scene featuring Victoria Principal and Reb Brown), but rather incorporated new footage filmed nearly two years after the original using two of the original film&#x27;s stars, Marjoe Gortner and Victoria Principal, as well as Jesse Vint and Michael Richardson (reprising their film roles of Marjoe Gortner&#x27;s taunting roommates), expanding on the original storyline from the theatrical film. Editing and re-recorded dialogue helped integrate this expansion into the original film. A short scene involving Richard Roundtree&#x27;s character, Miles Quade, was scripted, but never filmed. An entirely new storyline shot specifically for the television version was that of a young married couple (Debralee Scott and Sam Chew) flying to Los Angeles on an airplane. The husband seeks a job with the Royce Construction company of the film (in fact, hoping to work with Charlton Heston&#x27;s character, Stewart Graff), while his wife has the eerily accurate ability to see the future with tarot cards. Their airliner attempts to land at Los Angeles International Airport as the titular earthquake hits, and the airliner makes a touch-and-go landing on a runway that is breaking up, diverting to San Francisco. Throughout the remainder of the television version, the film cuts back to the couple as they discuss their future together, and the husband&#x27;s wish to return to Los Angeles and help rebuild the city.

The &quot;Sensurround&quot; audio of the original film was simulcast in FM stereo in the Los Angeles and New York markets. This theoretically allowed the home viewer (with the properly equipped sound system) to experience a similar effect as in the theater.

==Theme park attractions==

&quot;Earthquake&quot; inspired the attractions &quot;Earthquake: The Big One&quot; at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

The Hollywood attraction opened in March 1989 as part of the Studio Tour tram ride. The tram enters a sound stage, the interior designed to look like a San Francisco underground BART station, whereupon a two-and-a-half-minute simulation of an 8.3 earthquake takes place, featuring a gas truck falling into the station, a runaway train and a flood.

The Florida attraction opened in June 1990. It began with an introductory film on the making of &quot;Earthquake&quot; with Charlton Heston appearing to explain the special effects, followed by a live demonstration based on the film with audience participation. The attraction culminated in a simulated 8.3 earthquake aboard an underground train at Embarcadero Station in San Francisco. In the fall of 2002, the pre-show was changed to a more generic &quot;magic of making movies&quot; theme, with slight modifications which included mentioning special effects used in other films besides &quot;Earthquake&quot;. The Florida attraction officially closed on November 5, 2007, and reopened several months later as &quot;Disaster!: A Major Motion Picture Ride...Starring You!.&quot;

==Scientific accuracy==
The purported magnitude of the earthquake in the film (9.9 on the Richter Scale) would make it the largest ever recorded, eclipsing the record set by the actual Chilean Earthquake of 1960 (9.5 on the Richter Scale). However, such huge earthquakes can only be generated by &quot;megathrust&quot; faults or asteroid strikes. The numerous faults in California, particularly the San Andreas (the fault implied to have generated the titular earthquake in the film), are the &quot;strike-slip&quot; type, which historically have rarely produced tremors higher than 8.3 on the Richter Scale. [The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has had estimates between 7.9 and 8.3.]

<text>Tackhead (styled TACK»HEAD, sometimes known as Fats Comet) is an industrial hip-hop group that was most active during the 1980s and early 1990s, and briefly reformed in 2004 for a tour. Their music occupies the territory where funk, dub, industrial music and electronica intersect. The core members were Doug Wimbish (bass), Keith LeBlanc (percussion) and Skip McDonald (guitar) and producer (sometimes credited as &quot;mixologist&quot;) Adrian Sherwood. Despite being short-lived as a band proper, the legacy and output of these groups of musicians has been prodigious.

== History ==
In the late 1970s, Wimbish, LeBlanc and McDonald were members of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label and the trio of hip-hop artists known as the Sugarhill Gang. They were also the musicians playing behind DJ Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;The Message&quot; (the vocal was by Melle Mel) and another hit &quot;White Lines&quot;.

During a visit to New York City, to help with a remix, London-based producer Sherwood (already noted in the dub music scene) met LeBlanc, and they began to collaborate. Soon the trio of Wimbish, LeBlanc and McDonald were producing tracks on Sherwood&#x27;s On-U Sound record label. One of their earlier collaborations was as &quot;Mark Stewart and the Maffia&quot;, which featured Stewart, former member of Bristol’s The Pop Group, on vocals. Their first LP produced under that name &quot;As the Veneer of Democracy Starts to Fade&quot; was amongst the most industrial, noise-oriented and uncompromising of the group&#x27;s output, described by John Leland as &quot;a scary mess of random sounds, spoken words, and tiny snippets of music, processed and distorted to a grating electric edge.&quot;

Later to join forces with Tackhead was Bristol-based Gary Clail, who as MC for the touring version of the On-U sound system, would shout and rant over Tackhead&#x27;s live playing, and both were then mixed live by Sherwood to produce a wall of sound effect that was highly novel for the mid-1980s. They released one LP &quot;Tackhead Tape Time&quot; in 1987 as &quot;Gary Clail&#x27;s Tackhead Sound System&quot; and some of the most distinctive and well-known Tackhead tracks (some were released as 12-inch singles) date from this period particularly: &quot;What&#x27;s My Mission Now?&quot;, &quot;Mind at the End of the Tether&quot; and &quot;Hard Left&quot;. These tracks combined funk basslines, hammerblow percussion and Sherwood&#x27;s trademark sample-laden dub production and represent the defining Tackhead sound.

During this period, LeBlanc also produced two solo LPs: the highly inventive &quot;Major Malfunction&quot; (1986) (inspired by the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster) and &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (1989), which although credited to LeBlanc, featured all the rest of members of Tackhead. Around this time the group began to gel as a band, and started adding vocalists to what had been up until then a largely instrumental affair. On the first Tackhead LP proper, &quot;Friendly as a Hand Grenade&quot;, vocalist Bernard Fowler joined the line-up, and many older instrumental tracks re-appeared with lyrics, in what Trouser Press characterized as &quot;Tackhead at its most coherent.&quot; In 1990 Tackhead mounted a world tour which probably marked the zenith of the band&#x27;s commercial success.

The follow-up album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Strange Things&quot; (the first on a major label, EMI), despite some praise for harder-edge singles such as &quot;Dangerous Sex&quot; and &quot;Class Rock&quot; was not as well received by critics. Many followers of the group were disappointed by the more restrained production, less industrial and more mellow R&amp;B elements. Yet the album was still experimental enough that it did not gain as wide an audience as had been hoped, and the band was dropped from their record label shortly after.

Despite not recording any new material as Tackhead since, group members continued to record as the backing band or along with various Sherwood-led On-U Sound productions artists such as Gary Clail&#x27;s solo efforts, African Head Charge, Dub Syndicate, New Age Steppers and others. Subsets of the group have also appeared in various guises such as the Strange Parcels, Barmy Army and the blues-oriented Little Axe.

In addition to continuing to collaborate with Sherwood and the On-U Sound record label, each of the other members continues to lead active solo careers. McDonald leads the Little Axe project, and LeBlanc ran a record label and played with two jazz outfits, Noah Ground and Nikki Yeoh&#x27;s Infinitum. As well as remaining much in demand as a session bass player, Wimbish later became the bass player for Living Colour and has recorded solo material as well as forming the short-lived Jungle Funk (later Head»Fake), a live drum and bass outfit also featuring Living Colour drummer Will Calhoun.

In 2004, Tackhead briefly reformed to engage in a limited tour of North America and Europe. In April 2022, the entire group, also featuring Mark Stewart, played a short tour of the UK, comprising performances in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London.

LeBlanc died in April 2024.

<text>Base bleed or base burn (BB) is a system used on some artillery shells to increase range, typically by about 20%–35%. It expels gas into the low-pressure area behind the shell to reduce base drag (but does not produce thrust, unlike rocket-assisted projectiles). Being percentage-based, the range extension is more useful on longer-range artillery where an increase of approximately can be achieved, and it also was found that the reduced turbulence gave the projectiles a more consistent trajectory, resulting in tighter grouping, and efficient shelling more than away.

Base bleed technology was developed in Sweden in the mid-1960s but took some time to spread and find its niche between cheaper classical ordnance and even more expensive rocket-assisted projectiles. It is now a fairly common option.

== Function ==

Most (50–60%) of the drag on an artillery shell derives from the nose portion of the shell. Artillery shells travel through the air at supersonic speeds; as the shell pushes the air out of its way, it creates shock waves that bleed off the shell&#x27;s kinetic energy and therefore reduce its airspeed. Shaping the shell properly effectively reduces this component of drag; however, in regular flat-base artillery shells, the other large component is the so-called &quot;base drag&quot;, caused by the low-pressure (&quot;suction&quot;) area created directly behind the shell as it travels through the air.

Base drag can be reduced --without significantly extending the base of the shell or profiling it (as is done with sabot projectiles) by adding a small ring of metal extending just past the base, and placing a small gas generator to the rear part of the shell. The gas generator provides little to no thrust, but fills the vacuum in the area behind the shell with an inflow of gas, dramatically reducing drag.

This means that, at a cost of only very little space to fit the gas generator in the casing,
* a longer effective firing range can be achieved with the same amount of propellant
* less propellant is needed to achieve the same effective range as with normal munitions
* heavier shells can be fired to the same effective range

==History==
The principles were developed in Sweden in the mid-1960s by the Försvarets forskningsanstalt (abbreviated FOA) and the Artillery bureau at the Kungliga Materielförvaltningen (later the Försvarets Materielverk (FMV)) while working on a rocket-assisted projectile called &quot;reatil&quot;. Their goal was to increase the range of coastal artillery. By 1966, it had been concluded that a small slow-burning charge at the base of the projectile would alleviate the low pressure behind the shell, hence increasing the range by lessening the difference between the pressure due to aerodynamic drag on the nose of the shell and the low pressure behind the base. The first full-scale tests took place in 1969 with modified 10.5 cm steel shells, with excellent results, and the Swedish patent was granted to FOA in 1971 although both application and patent were classified. Since the development was done, the patent was transferred to FMV for procurement to the armed forces of Sweden.

The concept was quickly implemented into the &quot;7.5 cm sjömålsgranat m/66&quot; (7.5 cm anti-ship shell m/66) used in the 7.5 cm tornpjäs m/57 fixed coastal artillery gun, and then rapidly into all anti-ship shells in the Swedish military.

Since FMV was to contract a company in the US to manufacture the gas generator for the &quot;12 cm sjömålsgranat m/70&quot; (12 cm anti-ship shell m/70), used in the 12 cm TAP m/70 fixed coastal artillery gun, the classification &quot;secret&quot; was removed from the patent. Shortly thereafter the international rights were sold, eventually ending up with the Space Research Corporation (SRC), then owned by aeronautical engineer Gerald Bull.

By the end of the 20th century, the technology was generally available world-wide.

<text>Benjamin Franklin Goodrich (November 4, 1841 – August 3, 1888) was an American industrialist in the rubber industry and founder of B.F. Goodrich Company.

==Early life==
Goodrich was born in the farming town of Ripley, New York on November 4, 1841. He was a son of Anson Goodrich (1792–1847) and Susannah (née Dinsmoor) Goodrich (born 1799). Orphaned at the age of eight, he was raised by his uncle.

He received his M.D. from Cleveland Medical College (now Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine) in 1861, studied surgery at the University of Pennsylvania in 1863 and served as a battlefront surgeon for the Union Army in the Civil War with the rank of captain. After a few years in a struggling medical practice, he went to work in Pennsylvania&#x27;s oilfields and became a real estate speculator.

==Career==
After the war, he reached a licensing agreement with Charles Goodyear and bought the Hudson River Rubber Company in partnership with J.P. Morris in 1869. The company, located in Melrose, New York, failed. The following year he accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio to relocate his business there. He founded Goodrich, Tew &amp; Co. in 1870. Goodrich bought out Tew, and in 1880 the company became the B.F. Goodrich Company.

Goodrich was the first in Akron to own a telephone, which was a gift from Alexander Graham Bell in 1877. The telephone connected Goodrich&#x27;s house on Quaker Street to his factory on Rubber Street.

According to a story, Goodrich had seen a friend&#x27;s home burn to the ground, with firefighters rendered helpless because their leather hoses had frozen and cracked. Once settled in Akron, Goodrich ordered his company to begin producing cotton-wrapped rubber hose that would resist freezing. A few years later Goodrich started selling garden hoses (allowing bucketless garden watering) and bicycle tires. Still, the company teetered near bankruptcy and went through numerous name changes, its success still uncertain when Goodrich died at the age of 46 in 1888.

The business began booming at B.F. Goodrich Company a few years after Goodrich&#x27;s death with the company&#x27;s introduction of a pneumatic tire that could endure the speed and load of the evolving automobile. The radial tire was designed by an advertising employee in his company. Over subsequent decades, Goodrich Company chemists invented plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in 1926, synthesized rubber in 1937 and built spacesuits for NASA astronauts in the 1960s. Now renamed Goodrich Corporation, the company abandoned the tire business in 1988 and subsequently described itself as a global supplier of systems and services to the aerospace, defense, and homeland security markets. In 2012 the Goodrich Corporation was sold to United Technologies.

The brand name BFGoodrich now appears on tires made by Michelin, which bought the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company in 1994.

==Personal life==
On November 4, 1869, Goodrich was married to Mary Elizabeth Marvin (1841–1907), a daughter of U.S. Representative Richard Pratt Marvin and Isabella (née Newland) Marvin. Her uncle, William Marvin, was a United States federal judge and the 7th Governor of Florida. Together, Mary and Benjamin were the parents of:

* Charles Cross Goodrich (1871–1932), who was a Goodrich chemist and member of the Maine Legislature. He married Mary Anna Gellatly in 1895.
* Richard Marvin Goodrich (1872–1872), who died in infancy.
* Isabella Goodrich Breckinridge (1874–1961), who married John Cabell Breckinridge II (1870–1941), a grandson of John C. Breckinridge (the former Vice President of the United States under James Buchanan, a Confederate general and Confederate Secretary of War).
* David Marvin Goodrich (1876–1950), who became a Goodrich executive. He married Ruth Williams Pruyn, a daughter of banker Robert C. Pruyn in 1903. They divorced and in 1936 he married Beatrice (née Morgan) Pruyn, daughter of William Fellowes Morgan Sr. and the ex-wife of his first wife&#x27;s brother.

Goodrich died on August 3, 1888, in Manitou Springs, Colorado, where he had been in hopes of improving his health. He was buried in at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown, New York. After his death, his wife hired architect Guy Lowell in 1905 to design a 23-room mansion known as River House in York, Maine. His widow died in April 1907.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Isabella, he was a grandfather of Marvin Breckinridge Patterson, the photojournalist, cinematographer, and philanthropist, who married diplomat Jefferson Patterson.

<doc id="515237" wikidata="Q11904" url="?curid=515237" title="Eels (band)">
<text>Eels (often typeset as eels or EELS) is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1991 by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Mark Oliver Everett, known by the stage name E. Band members have changed over the years, both in the studio and on stage, making Everett the only official member for most of the band&#x27;s work. Eels&#x27; music is often filled with themes of family, death, and unrequited love. Since 1996, Eels has released fifteen studio albums, seven of which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

== History ==

=== E solo records ===
In 1991, Everett signed a contract with Polydor and released &quot;A Man Called E&quot; under the name E a year later. The single &quot;Hello Cruel World&quot; was a minor success. Touring to support the album, E opened for Tori Amos. &quot;A Man Called E&quot; was followed by &quot;Broken Toy Shop&quot; in 1993. This year also marked the beginning of E&#x27;s collaboration with drummer Jonathan &quot;Butch&quot; Norton. After &quot;Broken Toy Shop&quot;, E was released from his record deal with Polydor. E has performed two of the songs from &quot;Broken Toy Shop&quot; (&quot;The Only Thing I Care About&quot; and &quot;Manchester Girl&quot;) for his own live shows with Eels.

=== &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot; ===
Eels were officially founded when Butch and E met Tommy Walter. The name &quot;Eels&quot; was chosen so that the band&#x27;s records would be close to E&#x27;s solo records in an alphabetical ordering, although it was too late once they realized that numerous Eagles and Earth, Wind and Fire releases were in between. &quot;I went to the Virgin Megastore and I see the E CDs right at the beginning of the E section,&quot; Everett recalled on the &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; podcast with Phil Rosenthal and David Wild. &quot;And then there&#x27;s like, 28 Earth, Wind and Fire [albums], 40 Eagles [albums] -- they&#x27;re nowhere near each other!&quot;

Eels became one of the first groups to sign a record deal with DreamWorks Records, followed by Elliott Smith.

In 1996, the band released their debut album &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot;. The singles &quot;Novocaine for the Soul&quot;, &quot;Susan&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Your Lucky Day in Hell&quot; achieved modest national and international success, with the band winning the Best International Breakthrough Act award at the 1998 BRIT Awards. The single Susans House was extremely popular in the UK as stylistically it was similar to the Triphop genre which was popular at the time with its slow rhythm, mild tune and distorted 
spoken vocals. In 1996 and 1997, Eels toured extensively to support the album, building their name as a live act in the United States and Europe. In September 1997, Walter quit the band.

Released in May 2001, the motion picture soundtrack for the movie &quot;Shrek&quot; included the song &quot;My Beloved Monster&quot;.

=== &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot; ===
Following the success of &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot;, E experienced a difficult time in his personal life. His sister died by suicide, and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. These events inspired Eels&#x27; second album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot;. The album deals with many difficult subjects, including cancer, mental illness, suicide and death. The tragedy of Everett&#x27;s father&#x27;s death became prominent once more in the context of his mother&#x27;s impending death and his sister&#x27;s suicide, and as a result the song &quot;Baby Genius&quot; is written for his father Hugh Everett III. Contributions to the album were made by Jon Brion, Lisa Germano, Jim Jacobsen, Grant-Lee Phillips, Dust Brother Michael Simpson, and T-Bone Burnett.

The single &quot;Last Stop: This Town&quot; saw minor success, while &quot;Cancer for the Cure&quot;, the second single from the album, appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999).

Still a three-piece band on stage, Tommy Walter was replaced by Adam Siegel. Part of the American leg of the tour was canceled after the death of E&#x27;s mother. They returned to tour Europe later in the year, to open for Pulp.

=== &quot;Daisies of the Galaxy&quot; ===
In 2000, Eels released &quot;Daisies of the Galaxy&quot;. The album, which was recorded almost entirely in E&#x27;s basement, is lighter and more upbeat than its predecessor. Everett noted, &quot;if &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot; was the phone call in the middle of the night that the world doesn&#x27;t want to answer, then &quot;Daisies of the Galaxy&quot; is the hotel wake-up call that says your lovely breakfast is ready&quot;. He was joined in the studio by Michael Simpson (Dust Brothers), Grant-Lee Phillips (Grant Lee Buffalo), and Peter Buck (R.E.M.).

The first single, &quot;Mr. E&#x27;s Beautiful Blues&quot;, was co-written by Simpson. The song was not intended to be on the album, but the record company insisted on its inclusion. Therefore, it was not featured on the track listing but was instead listed on the cover sticker as a bonus track, separated from the rest of the album by 20 seconds of silence.

To promote &quot;Daisies of the Galaxy&quot;, another tour took place across the United States and Europe, with the band also playing their first concerts in Australia. For these performances, Eels were transformed into a 6-piece orchestra, including Lisa Germano and Probyn Gregory. E also played some solo shows, opening for Fiona Apple.

=== &quot;Souljacker&quot; and &quot;Shootenanny!&quot; ===
In 2001, &quot;Souljacker&quot; was released, an album with a heavier feel and more rock-oriented sound than &quot;Daisies of the Galaxy&quot;. John Parish, previously of PJ Harvey&#x27;s band, co-wrote most of the songs and played guitar on the album and first part of the tour. After Parish became a father, he was replaced with Joe Gore for the American leg of the Bus Driving, Band Rocking Tour. Koool G Murder played bass and keyboards and joined Eels on tour.

2003 marked the release of the album &quot;Shootenanny!&quot;. E now refers to the album as a break from recording the following &quot;Blinking Lights&quot; album. It was recorded live in the studio in only ten days. &quot;Saturday Morning&quot; was released as a single.

Butch was replaced on drums by Puddin&#x27;. In 2003, Eels embarked upon another big tour, called the Tour of Duty. The live band consisted of E, Goldenboy (guitar), Koool G Murder (bass) and Puddin&#x27; (drums). Later that year, E composed the score for the film &quot;Levity&quot;.

=== &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot; and &quot;Eels with Strings&quot; ===

Eels&#x27; next album, &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot;, was released on April 26, 2005, and was the band&#x27;s first release for new label Vagrant Records. It is a 33-track double album. Contributions were made by Tom Waits, Peter Buck, John Sebastian (The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful), Jim Jacobsen, and Butch.

The first tour in support of the &quot;Blinking Lights&quot; album, billed as Eels with Strings, featured primarily performances by E on acoustic guitar, organ or piano, backed by Allen &quot;Big Al&quot; Hunter on piano and upright bass, Jeffrey Lyster (also known as Chet Atkins III or &quot;The Chet&quot;) on guitar, mandolin, pedal steel, musical saw and drums, and a string quartet consisting of violinists Paloma Udovic and Julie Carpenter, violist Heather Lockie and cellist Ana Lenchantin. The tour resulted in a live album, &quot;Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall&quot;, recorded in New York City. The performance includes tracks from all of their albums, and was released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006.

=== &quot;Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I&quot; and &quot;Useless Trinkets&quot; ===
In early 2008, Eels released their first &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation as well as a compilation of B-sides, rarities, soundtrack singles and unreleased tracks. &quot;Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I&quot; spans the first decade of the Eels, including singles from all their albums, as well as a DVD featuring music videos and one live performance video. &quot;Useless Trinkets&quot; contains 50 B-sides and rarities and a DVD of their Lollapalooza 2006 performances. To promote the releases, the band went on a world tour, An Evening With Eels. This time, only the Chet joined E on stage, both playing a broad cross-section from the Eels repertoire on a variety of instruments. The concerts also featured the Chet reading excerpts from E&#x27;s 2008 autobiography, &quot;Things the Grandchildren Should Know&quot;. On this tour, the band released a live CD/DVD package of Eels&#x27; 2006 performance at the &quot;London Astoria&quot;, &quot;Live and in Person!&quot;, documenting a show from the second tour in support of &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot;.

The soundtrack of the 2008 comedy film &quot;Yes Man&quot; features nine songs by Eels, including &quot;Man Up&quot;, a brand new song.

=== Concept album trilogy: &quot;Hombre Lobo&quot;, &quot;End Times&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; ===

&quot;Hombre Lobo,&quot; the seventh Eels studio album, was released on June 2, 2009. The album comprises twelve new songs. &quot;Hombre Lobo&quot; is Spanish for &quot;wolf man&quot; or &quot;werewolf&quot; and references E&#x27;s unusually long beard, which he originally grew when writing the song &quot;Dog Faced Boy&quot;. On March 31, 2009, the band made the track &quot;Fresh Blood&quot; available on Spinner, explaining that the song would be the lead single for the album. A Jesse Dylan-directed music video was released on April 29, 2009, as well, and the track would become the theme song of the 2015 HBO documentary miniseries &quot;The Jinx&quot;. The album was released as a single-disc CD and a deluxe edition with a DVD. In September 2009, Eels released a music video for &quot;That Look You Give That Guy&quot;, featuring Bobby Jr., E and &quot;Top Chef&quot; host Padma Lakshmi.

While promoting this album, Eels released the live EP &quot;The Myspace Transmissions Session 2009&quot; on October 14, 2009. That same day, the band&#x27;s website announced that a new Eels album entitled &quot;End Times&quot; would be released on January 19, 2010. It was largely recorded on a four-track recorder and is based on the themes of broken love. Three album tracks—&quot;Little Bird&quot;, &quot;In My Younger Days&quot;, and &quot;A Line in the Dirt&quot;—were made available as music videos or promotional downloads prior to the release of the album. Once again, Butch contributed drums to &quot;A Line in the Dirt&quot;. On January 19, 2010, &quot;End Times&quot; was released. E made no comment on touring and there was no tour scheduled to begin.

A second album was announced on May 20, 2010: &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; was described as the &quot;final installment of a trilogy that began with &quot;Hombre Lobo&quot; and &quot;End Times&quot;.&quot; The three albums respectively explore themes of desire, loss, and redemption. A world tour, the first since 2007&#x27;s An Evening With Eels tour, was announced at the same time. This tour once again featured the Chet on various instruments, alongside Koool G Murder on bass, trilogy drummer Knuckles on drums and a new member, P-Boo, on guitar.

=== &quot;Wonderful, Glorious&quot; and &quot;The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett&quot; ===
On February 5, 2013, the 10th Eels studio album was released, entitled &quot;Wonderful, Glorious&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Peach Blossom&quot;, premiered on SoundCloud on November 6, 2012. A month later, on December 4, 2012, the official video was released on Stereogum. The second single, &quot;New Alphabet&quot;, was streamed pre-release on December 12, 2012, on Spinner

On March 25, 2013, the band released a parody music video called &quot;Cold Dead Hand&quot; through Funny or Die, with Jim Carrey replacing E on vocals. The song and video, set as a musical act during the variety program &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, lampoons American gun culture, and specifically Charlton Heston, former President of the National Rifle Association of America.

Eels&#x27; eleventh studio album, &quot;The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett&quot;, was released on April 21, 2014, on E Works Records. In April 2015, the band released the DVD and double live album &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

In 2015, Eels created their own version of Melanie De Biasio&#x27;s track &quot;I Feel You&quot; for the album &quot;Gilles Peterson Presents – No Deal Remixed&quot;. The track was later used to promote the 2017 film &quot;&quot;, directed by Ridley Scott, and appears during the entire in-universe short movie &quot;Meet Walter&quot; starring Michael Fassbender.

=== &quot;The Deconstruction&quot; and &quot;Earth to Dora&quot; ===
On January 17, 2018, Eels announced their 12th studio album, &quot;The Deconstruction&quot;, to be released on April 6, 2018, their first in nearly four years. They also announced a supporting tour throughout the United States and Europe, beginning in Pomona, California on May 28, 2018. The album travels through many styles sonically, but its lyrics primarily deal with rebuilding one&#x27;s life and looking back on what went wrong. Singles include (in release order) the title track, &quot;Today Is the Day&quot;, &quot;Premonition&quot;, and &quot;Bone Dry&quot;. Styles present on the album include orchestral pop, power pop, psychedelic pop/rock, indie/alternative rock and post-modern pop.

The band&#x27;s next release was the single &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Make It Real&quot;/&quot;Who You Say You Are&quot;, announced on September 1, 2020. These songs were featured on the subsequent studio album, &quot;Earth to Dora&quot; (2020).

=== &quot;Extreme Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;Eels Time!&quot; ===
On September 21, 2021, it was announced that the 14th Eels album would be called &quot;Extreme Witchcraft&quot; and would be released on January 28, 2022. The album was produced by E and John Parish in their first collaboration since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Souljacker&quot;. &quot;Eels So Good: Essential Eels, Vol. 2 (2007–2020)&quot; came out in late 2023. On February 29, 2024, the band announced &quot;Eels Time!&quot;, which was released on June 7.

== Members ==
Eels have had a number of lineup changes supporting E since their formation, and in recent years the live band has often differed from the musicians on the albums. Koool G Murder has been credited on bass and production on recent albums, although Big Al has fulfilled the role of bassist during the live shows.

<doc id="515239" wikidata="Q6541449" url="?curid=515239" title="Libertarianz">
<text>Libertarianz was a political party in New Zealand (hence the suffix -nz) that advocated libertarianism, favouring self-government and limiting the power of the government over the individual. Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism was a major influence on the party. Its slogan &quot;More Freedom, Less Government&quot; is indicative of the party&#x27;s basic policy platform. It went into recess and was de-registered by its own request in 29 January 2014.

==History==
Libertarianz was founded in late 1995 by Ian Fraser, who served as the party&#x27;s first leader. Later, Lindsay Perigo, a well-known New Zealand broadcaster for Radio New Zealand and TVNZ, assumed the leadership. Perigo was followed as leader by Peter Cresswell and then Russell Watkins. At the time of its deregistration the leader was Richard McGrath, and the Party president was Shane Pleasance.

The party&#x27;s first campaign was the 1996 election, the first to be held under the MMP electoral system. Libertarianz&#x27;s involvement in the election produced negligible public interest. They gained 671 votes (0.03%), which placed them in 19th place. In the 1999 elections, the party performed somewhat better, gaining 5,949 votes (0.29%). This put them in 11th place, and in fourth place among the parties which did not gain seats in parliament. Libertarianz did not contest the party vote in the 2002 elections – due to an oversight, the party&#x27;s bank cheque was not transmitted to the electoral authorities by the appointed time. The party was therefore able to contest the election only through individual electorate candidates. Its five candidates gained 672 votes amongst them.

===&quot;Darnton v Clark&quot;===
On 29 June 2006, Bernard Darnton filed proceedings in the High Court, suing Helen Clark for allegedly misappropriating public funds to pay for the Labour Party&#x27;s pledge cards during the 2005 election. Some commentators labelled the lawsuit a stunt, although it received some media coverage as concern about the &quot;pledge card&quot; funding grew. On Sunday 10 September 2006, the lawsuit was the subject of a front-page story in &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot; newspaper. The Labour party promptly accused the Libertarianz party of being part of a conspiracy with National party, alleging that the small party could not afford to bring such a case to court.

In October 2006, after the auditor-general released a report declaring that the misappropriation of funds was illegal, Labour and other political parties immediately announced that they would pay back the money. On 17 and 18 October, a majority, including the Labour Party, passed a law through Parliament to &#x27;retrospectively validate&#x27; the spending, making it legal, which is required under the Public Finance Act 1989. In the circumstances, however, it also effectively makes the misspending immune from court proceedings. In response, the Libertarianz party declared 18 October 2006 to be &quot;Banana Republic Day&quot;, and issued press releases.

===Dissolution (2014)===
In January 2014, Party Leader Richard McGrath asked the Electoral Commission to de-register the party, given that practical administrative tasks such as maintaining membership were rendered impossible by the part-time and voluntary status of its membership and executive. The commission de-registered the party on 29 January 2014. Instead, McGrath advised former party members to support ACT New Zealand, under the organisational leadership of newly elected party president Jamie Whyte.

==Election results (1996–2011)==
===New Zealand general election, 2008===
The Libertarianz party contested the 2008 New Zealand General Election, which was held on 8 November. It fielded candidates in 16 electorates. Altogether, it received 1176 votes (0.05% of the total proportion of votes cast).

===Mount Albert by-election 2009===
At the 13 June 2009 Mount Albert by-election, Julian Pistorius stood as the candidate for Libertarianz and polled in ninth place (39 votes), lowest of all party-affiliated candidates who contested that by-election.

<doc id="515246" wikidata="Q3283363" url="?curid=515246" title="Switched-On Bach">
<text>Switched-On Bach is the debut album by the American composer Wendy Carlos, released in October 1968 by Columbia Records. Produced by Carlos and Rachel Elkind, the album is a collection of pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach performed by Carlos and Benjamin Folkman on a Moog synthesizer. It played a key role in bringing synthesizers to popular music, which had until then been mostly used in experimental music.

&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; reached number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Classical Albums chart from 1969 to 1972. By June 1974, it had sold over one million copies, and in 1986 it became the second classical album to be certified platinum. In 1970, it won Grammy Awards for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. 

After Carlos came out as a transgender woman in 1979, reissues of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; amended the artist credit to reflect her change of name, as was the case with the rest of her discography up to that point.

== Background ==
Around 1967, Carlos asked the musician Rachel Elkind to listen to her electronic compositions. They included compositions written ten years earlier as well as some from 1964 co-written with her friend Benjamin Folkman at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City. One recording was a rendition of Two-Part Invention in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach, which Carlos described as &quot;charming&quot;.

Soon after, Carlos began plans to produce an album of Bach pieces performed on the recently invented Moog synthesizer. She intended to use the novel technology to make &quot;appealing music you could really listen to&quot;, not &quot;ugly&quot; music being produced by avant-garde musicians at the time. Elkind was impressed with the recording of Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major and became the album&#x27;s producer. Elkind contacted her friend, producer and conductor Ettore Stratta at Columbia Records, who &quot;generously spread his enthusiasm throughout the rest of the company&quot; and assisted in the album production. Paul Myers of Columbia Masterworks granted Carlos, Folkman, and Elkind artistic freedom to record and release it.

== Recording ==

&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; features ten pieces by Bach available under the public domain, performed by Carlos, with assistance from Folkman, on a Moog synthesizer. Carlos worked closely with the Moog designer, Robert Moog, testing his components and suggesting improvements. Most of the album was recorded in a rented studio apartment in which Carlos lived at 410 West End Avenue on the West Side of Manhattan in New York City, using a custom-built 8-track recording machine constructed by Carlos from components built by Ampex. The initial track created, however, the Invention in F major, was recorded in the spring of 1967 on a Scully tape machine in Gotham Recording Studios at 2 West 46th Street, where Carlos had brought Moog equipment for a commercial project.

According to Carlos, &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; took approximately five months and one thousand hours to produce. As the synthesizers were monophonic, meaning only one note can be played at a time, each track was assembled one at a time. Carlos said: &quot;You had to release the note before you could make the next note start, which meant you had to play with a detached feeling on the keyboard, which was really very disturbing in making music.&quot; The synthesizer was unreliable and often went out of tune; Carlos recalled hitting it with a hammer prior to recording to obtain correct levels. After several notes were played, it was checked again to make sure it had not drifted.

Bach provided only the two chords of a Phrygian Cadence for the second movement of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major, intending that the musician would improvise on these chords. Carlos and Folkman carefully constructed this piece to showcase the capabilities of the Moog.

== Artwork ==
&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; was released with two different covers. The most common features a man dressed as Bach standing before a Moog synthesizer. The first pressing featured the same man seated, as shown above, with no credit to Carlos on the front cover. Carlos and Elkind objected to this original cover and had it replaced, finding it &quot;was a clownish, trivializing image of a mugging Bach, supposedly hearing some absurd sound from his earphones&quot;. They also objected to the fact that the synthesizer was incorrectly set up: &quot;[The earphones] were plugged into the input, not output, of a 914 filter module, which in turn was connected to nothing, [assuring] that silence is all that would have greeted Johann Sebastian&#x27;s ears.&quot;

== Release ==
In 1968, shortly before the release of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, Robert Moog spoke at the annual Audio Engineering Society conference and played one of Carlos&#x27; recordings from the album. Moog recalled: &quot;I walked off the stage and went to the back of the auditorium while people were listening, and I could feel it in the air. They were jumping out of their skins. These technical people were involved in so much flim-flam, so much shoddy, opportunistic stuff, and here was something that was just impeccably done and had obvious musical content and was totally innovative. The tape got a standing ovation.&quot;

&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; was released in October 1968. In 1969, it entered the top 40 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 before it reached a peak of No. 10 that year, for a total of 59 weeks on the chart. From January 1969 to January 1972, the album was No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Classical Albums chart, and it reached the seventh position of the Top 50 Albums chart of the Canadian magazine RPM. In February 1974, Columbia Records estimated 960,000 copies of the album had been sold in the US. In June that year, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported the album&#x27;s sales surpassed one million, the second classical music record in history to achieve the feat. In August 1969, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for sales in excess of 1 million copies. It reached Platinum certification in November 1986.

=== Reception ===

&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; received negative reviews from some classical music traditionalists, but gained popularity among many younger listeners. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Bruce Eder noted that Carlos&#x27; approach &quot;was highly musical in ways that ordinary listeners could appreciate ... characterized by ... amazing sensitivity and finely wrought nuances, in timbre, tone, and expressiveness.&quot; The Canadian pianist Glenn Gould spoke highly of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, saying: &quot;The whole record, in fact, is one of the most startling achievements of the recording industry in this generation and certainly one of the great feats in the history of &#x27;keyboard&#x27; performance.&quot; In 1972 Gould participated in the Columbia Records project &quot;Switched-Off Bach&quot;, which presented the same songs acoustically rather than electronically.

In 1970, the album won three Grammy Awards: Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording.

=== Influence ===
Following the album&#x27;s success, Moog received requests from producers and artists for his synthesizers. A number of other Moog synthesizer albums were released, such as &quot;Switched-On Rock&quot; by the Moog Machine, &quot;Music to Moog By&quot; by Gershon Kingsley, and &quot;The Moog Strikes Bach&quot; by Hans Wurman. Moog credited the album for demonstrating that synthesizers could be used for more than avant-garde music and sound effects. He said of the album&#x27;s success:

In 1972 Columbia Records released an orchestral album, &quot;Switched Off Bach&quot;, with the same track listing as &quot;Switched-On Bach.&quot; The producer Giorgio Moroder credits Carlos&#x27;s Moog-based album for bringing synthesizers to his attention. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys called it &quot;one of the most electrifying albums I ever heard.&quot; It was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2005.

=== Reissues ===
&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; was remastered and included as part of the &quot;Switched-On Boxed Set&quot;, a four-CD box set released in 1999 with &quot;The Well-Tempered Synthesizer&quot;, &quot;Switched-On Bach II&quot;, and &quot;Switched-On Brandenburgs&quot;. In 1992, Carlos also released &quot;Switched-On Bach 2000&quot; to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her first album, featuring a re-recording of the record using digital synthesizers and computer-assisted recording with an added introductory composition styled as a birthday fanfare for the project. In 2001, a remastered edition was released with a previously unreleased track, &quot;Initial Experiments, demonstration&quot;. Carlos wrote: &quot;You may rest assured that this is the best these recordings have ever sounded.&quot;

<text>The Hokuriku Shinkansen () is a high-speed Shinkansen railway line connecting Tokyo with Tsuruga in the Hokuriku region of Japan. It is jointly operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and West Japan Railway Company (JR West). 

The first section, between and in Nagano Prefecture, opened on 1 October 1997 in time for the 1998 Winter Olympics, and was originally called the . The extension to in Toyama Prefecture and Kanazawa in Ishikawa Prefecture opened on 14 March 2015. Construction of a further section onward to and in Fukui Prefecture, covering 125 kilometers and six stations, commenced in 2012 and opened on 16 March 2024. The route of the final section to Shin-Osaka was decided on 20 December 2016 as the Osaka–Kyoto route, with construction expected to begin in the late 2020s and take about 25 years, after impact assessment procedures for areas along the line are completed.

==Train names and service patterns==
Since March 2015, services on the line are split into four types, with train names as listed below. Trains operate over the Joetsu and Tohoku Shinkansen tracks between Tokyo and Takasaki.

* &quot;Kagayaki&quot;: Tokyo–Tsuruga, limited-stop service, since 14 March 2015
* &quot;Hakutaka&quot;: Tokyo–Tsuruga, mostly all-stations service, since 14 March 2015
* &quot;Tsurugi&quot;: Toyama–Tsuruga, mostly all-stations shuttle service, since 14 March 2015
* &quot;Asama&quot;: Tokyo–Nagano, mostly all-stations service, corresponding to existing Nagano Shinkansen service introduced in 1997

The original Nagano Shinkansen &quot;Asama&quot; services, introduced in 1997, replaced the conventional Shin&#x27;etsu Main Line limited express services, also named &quot;Asama&quot;, which previously took 2 hours 50 minutes from Tokyo (Ueno Station) to Nagano. Following the opening of the Shinkansen, part of the conventional line was abandoned between Yokokawa and Karuizawa. This section included the steeply-graded Usui Pass which required the use of bank engines on all trains. Travel time between Tokyo and Tsuruga is 3 hours 8 minutes, 50 minutes shorter than using a conventional train between Kanazawa and Tsuruga.

==Stations==
Legend:


* The boundary between JR East and JR West lies immediately to the north of Jōetsumyōkō Station.
* Stations in italics are not currently operational.

=== Notes ===
As of 2024, the maximum line speed is between Tokyo and Ueno, between Ueno and Omiya, between Omiya and Takasaki, and between Takasaki and Tsuruga.

==Rolling stock==

* E7 series 12-car &quot;F&quot; sets&quot; (since 15 March 2014)
* W7 series 12-car &quot;W&quot; sets&quot; (since 14 March 2015)

With the start of Nagano Shinkansen services, trains were operated by a new fleet of JR East E2 series 8-car sets. A fleet of 17 new E7 series 12-car trainsets were phased in from March 2014, and these were augmented by a fleet of 10 JR West W7 series 12-car sets introduced from March 2015. The fleet of W7 series was purchased at a cost of ¥32.8 billion. The remaining E2 series trainsets were withdrawn from Hokuriku Shinkansen services on 31 March 2017.

In 2019, ten trains, eight from JR East with a book value of ¥11.8 billion and two from JR West, were damaged when a train yard in Nagano was flooded as the Chikuma River overflowed during typhoon Hagibis. As a result, JR West suffered a loss of .

===Non-revenue-earning types===
* East i (E926)

===Former rolling stock===
* E2 series 8-car &quot;N&quot; sets on Tokyo - Nagano &quot;Asama&quot; services only
* E2 series 8-car &quot;J&quot; sets
* E4 series 8-car &quot;P50/P80&quot; sets as &quot;Max Asama&quot;
* 200 series 12-car set F80 during February 1998 only

The original E2 series 8-car &quot;J&quot; sets, primarily used on Tohoku Shinkansen services were also used on some &quot;Asama&quot; services until they were subsequently lengthened to 10 cars. One specially-modified 200 series set, numbered F80, was used on additional &quot;Asama&quot; services in February 1998 during the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano. The train was modified to operate on both 25 kV AC 50 Hz and 60 Hz overhead power supplies, incorporated weight-saving measures to comply with the 16 tonne axle load restriction, and included additional control equipment to cope with the 30‰ gradient of the Nagano Shinkansen. Its maximum speed was limited to . The last services operated using eight-car E2 series trainsets ran on 31 March 2017, from which date all &quot;Asama&quot; services were formed of E7 and W7 series trainsets.

==History==

===Nagano Shinkansen===
The initial section between Takasaki and Nagano opened on 1 October 1997, in time for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.

Between May 2012 and March 2014, station platforms on the Nagano Shinkansen had their platform roofs extended to handle the E7 series 12-car trains which entered service in March 2014 ahead of the March 2015 opening of the extension beyond Nagano. The Hokuriku Shinkansen extension from Nagano to opened in March 2015. The 113-km extension from Kanazawa to Tsuruga was approved for construction in June 2012.

From the start of the revised timetable on 15 March 2014, E7 series trainsets were introduced on &quot;Asama&quot; services. Initially used on seven return services daily, this number was increased to eleven return services daily from 19 April 2014.

=== Naming ===
The line&#x27;s legal name has always been Hokuriku Shinkansen. However, just before the opening of the Nagano section, JR East decided that using this name in passenger service was to be avoided. From March 22 1997 until the extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Kanazawa, the primary route for Hokuriku customers (from the Tokyo area) was to use the Joetsu Shinkansen to Echigo-Yuzawa Station, then transfer to Hakutaka via the Hokuetsu Express, rendering using the Takasaki–Nagano section of the Hokuriku Shinkansen meaningless for them. Therefore, JR East sought other names.

On the other hand, local governments in Hokuriku, fearing construction west of Nagano may be halted, petitioned that the name &quot;Hokuriku&quot; should remain in use for operational purposes.
JR East announced the following solution on July 25, 1997:

*Voice announcements using &quot;Nagano Shinkansen&quot;
*Tokyo area stations using depictions with &quot;Nagano-&quot;bound&quot; Shinkansen&quot;.
*Stations between Annaka-Haruna Station and Nagano Station depicting &quot;Shinkansen&quot; only.

Soon, &quot;Nagano-&quot;bound&quot; Shinkansen&quot; fell out of use, and timetables by various publishers use &quot;Nagano Shinkansen&quot; only. Construction to Kanazawa was officially decided, thereby reducing the opposition to the name.

===Extension beyond Nagano===

Construction of the extension from Nagano to Kanazawa was completed on 24 May 2014. When services commenced in March 2015, the travel time from Tokyo to Toyama was reduced to about 2 hours, with Kanazawa an additional 30 minutes away. Final permission to start construction to Fukui was granted in December 2011, with modification works to Fukui Station already in progress for several years in anticipation of the extension. The extension to Tsuruga was approved for construction on 30 June 2012, and opened on 16 March 2024. Beyond Jōetsumyōkō Station, the line is operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) instead of East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

===Naming issue rises again===
Many people speculated about and discussed what the line&#x27;s operational name should be after Nagano–Kanazawa section is completed.

Nagano economic associations argued a sudden change in name will confuse customers, propose &quot;Nagano–Hokuriku Shinkansen&quot; to be used. In contrast government officials and economic associations in Hokuriku region defended the legal name, including statements such as &quot;a just result should come after 3 prefectures striving for 40 years&quot;.

Section west of Jōetsumyōkō belongs to JR West, which did not state an opinion and used &quot;Hokuriku Shinkansen&quot; only.

On October 2, 2013, JR East announced formal line name will be Hokuriku Shinkansen (consistent with National Shinkansen Railway Development Act) and depicted as Hokuriku Shinkansen (via Nagano) to reflect its expansion into the region, resolving the naming issue.

===Test-running===
Test-running on the JR East section of the line between Nagano and Kurobe-Unazukionsen commenced on 1 December 2013, initially at low speeds using the &quot;East i&quot; test train. From 6 December, test-running commenced using 10-car E2 series trainsets, with running speeds gradually increased to the full line speed of . Test-running continued until the end of March 2014. Test-running on the entire line between Nagano and Kanazawa (Hakusan Depot) started on 1 August 2014, using the &quot;East i&quot; test train. Test-running using W7 series trains commenced on 5 August 2014, initially at low speed, on the JR West section between and .

===Tsuruga extension===
In the months preceding the opening, JR West conducted various low speed runs on the new Kanazawa-Tsuruga section using &quot;East i&quot; test trains on 23 September 2023. Runs using regular W7 series trainsets started on 26 September. Regular passenger service began on 16 March 2024, with ceremonies at both and from the respective presidents of JR West and JR East. The extension cost to build.

In accordance with the opening of the extension, the limited express service &quot;Thunderbird&quot; ended its service between Tsuruga and Kanazawa on 15 March 2024.

==Future plans==
The route of the final section from to was finalized on 20 December 2016 as the Obama–Kyoto route. JRTT proposed three possible stations in Kyoto at an August 8, 2024 meeting. Two options include a new station underground near Kyoto Station. The third option is a newly constructed station near Katsuragawa Station, also underground. The route extension is estimated to cost up to 5.3 trillion yen and require up to 28 years to complete construction.

Including the Obama-Kyoto route, the following four options were under consideration before the December 2016 announcement, with a fifth unofficial option suggested by a local politician.
# : This involved building a full standard shinkansen track to Maibara Station. The proposal was one third of the length of the Obama Route, and provided good access to both Kyoto and Nagoya. However, a severe drawback was that it would have resulted in longer travel time to Osaka than the other options and trains would have had to use the existing, already heavily congested Tokaido Shinkansen tracks between Maibara and Shin-Osaka.
# : This involved no new track construction; instead, this proposal would have upgraded the Kosei Line to , either by regauging or dual-gauging the line to support Mini-Shinkansen, or alternatively utilizing Gauge Change Train (GCT) operations. This was the cheapest option, but meant train speeds would likely be limited to a maximum of and hence travel times would have been longer than the other options. 
# : First proposed in 1973, this route involved building a full standard shinkansen track via and . It was the shortest route to Osaka, but also the most expensive (approximately 1 trillion yen), and would have bypassed .
# : This, the now selected route, was first made public in August 2015, and involves following the proposed Obama Route west as far as Obama and then building shinkansen track southward to link with the Tokaido Shinkansen at . Including Kyoto on the route is seen as important to increase tourism.
# : Kyoto politician, Shoji Nishida&#x27;s proposal from Tsuruga, via Obama, to Maizuru then south-east to Kyoto City, southern Osaka City, and Kansai International Airport. This option did not have a price estimated, but would have likely been the most expensive due to the scale of the proposal. Its case was to provide development to the Maizuru region as per the Japanese national government&#x27;s policy, with the Maizuru Maritime Self-Defence Force Base and several nuclear power stations put forward as reasonable traffic generators. The option to extend the line south of Kyoto to a new Osaka station (, located in the south east of Osaka City) was seen as a means to avoid the congestion of the Tokaido line. It may have served as an alternative route or terminus to Shin-Osaka station for Tokaido line trains, reducing Tokaido line congestion.

A government committee deliberating the proposals decided in April 2016 to narrow the proposed route to three alignments between and and two alignments between Kyoto and (a northern route through Minoh and a southern route through the Kansai Science City). On 6 March 2017 the government committee announced the chosen route from Kyoto to Shin-Osaka is to be via Kyotanabe, with a station at Matsuiyamate on the Katamachi Line. There are also requests from Kyoto City and Kyoto Prefecture, local governments along the route, to further extend the line to .

===Interim plans===
In an attempt to extend the benefits of the Hokuriku Shinkansen to stations west of Tsuruga before the section to Shin-Osaka is completed, JR West was working in partnership with Talgo on the development of a Gauge Change Train (GCT), which was proposed to be capable of operating under both the 25 kV AC electrification used on the Shinkansen and the 1.5 kV DC system employed on conventional lines. The six-car train was due to start trials on the Hokuriku Shinkansen and the 1067 mm-gauge Hokuriku and Kosei lines in 2017. As part of the project JR West had begun trials with a purpose-built 180 m-long gauge-changer at Tsuruga. However, as a result of the abandonment of the proposed use of a GCT on the West Kyushu Shinkansen to Nagasaki by JR Kyushu, in August 2018 JR West announced that the proposed GCT between Tsuruga and Osaka had been abandoned.

==Conventional lines running parallel to the Hokuriku Shinkansen==
With the opening of the initial Nagano Shinkansen section in October 1997, the section of the conventional (narrow gauge) Shinetsu Main Line running along approximately the same route between and was transferred from the control of JR East to a newly established third-sector railway operating company, Shinano Railway, becoming the Shinano Railway Line.

With the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen extension north of Nagano on 14 March 2015, the conventional lines running along approximately the same route were transferred from the control of their respective JR owning companies to newly established third-sector railway operating companies funded primarily by the prefectural and municipal governments through which the lines pass. A total of of route between Nagano and Kanazawa was transferred to four separate operating companies, including of the Shinetsu Main Line between Nagano and , and of the Hokuriku Main Line between Naoetsu and Kanazawa. Details of the five third-sector operating companies and their respective lines are as shown below.

In 2019, it was decided that the section of the Hokuriku Main Line between Tsuruga and Fukui would be transferred to third-sector railway operating companies. Three years later in 2022, it was determined that the section would be split among two operators. The IR Ishikawa Railway would extend their operations from Kanazawa to Daishoji, while a new company, Hapi-Line Fukui, established during the preparation phase, would take over the section between Daishoji and Tsuruga. Hapi-Line Fukui is expected to overtake the section of the Hokuriku Main Line effective the 16 March 2024 timetable revision.

<text>The Junkers Ju 89 was a heavy bomber designed for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; prior to World War II. Two prototypes were constructed, but the project was abandoned without the aircraft entering production. Elements of its design were incorporated into later Junkers aircraft.

==Development==

From the very beginnings of the Luftwaffe in 1933, General Walther Wever, the chief of staff, realised the importance that strategic bombing would play in any future conflict. A &quot;Langstrecken-Grossbomber&quot; (&quot;long-range big bomber&quot;) was needed to fulfill this role.

Under the Ural bomber programme, he began secret talks with two of Nazi Germany&#x27;s leading aircraft manufacturers - Dornier and Junkers - requesting designs for a long-range bomber. The two companies responded with the Dornier Do 19 and the Junkers Ju 89, respectively, and the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) ordered prototypes for both aircraft in 1935. The RLM request asked for two prototypes and a prototype series of nine aircraft.

The Ju 89 and its competitor, the Dornier Do 19, proved promising, but fell victim to a change of direction within the Luftwaffe. Wever was killed in a plane crash in 1936. His successors – Albert Kesselring, Ernst Udet, and Hans Jeschonnek – favoured smaller, tactical aircraft, since they could be used to support army operations; they also did not require as much material and manpower. They were proponents of the dive bomber (Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;) and the doctrine of close support and destruction of the opposing air forces on the battle-ground rather than through attacking enemy industry. They convinced Hermann Göring by emphasising the need for tactical bombers to act in an army support role. Albert Kesselring, Wever&#x27;s successor, believed that what Germany required were more fighters and tactical bombers.

Kesselring and Jeschonnek had suggested to Göring that it would be better to drop heavy bomber projects due to material shortages. Around 2.5 tactical bombers could be built with the same material as one heavy bomber. In May 1937 Göring is reported as saying to Erhard Milch &#x27;The Führer does not ask me how big my bombers are, but how many there are&#x27;.

While these beliefs seemed validated by Germany&#x27;s early successes in the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, the lack of strategic bombing capability severely hampered the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain and Operation Barbarossa.

===First prototype===
On 11 April 1937, the Ju 89 prototype D-AFIT (V1, c/n 4911) was first flown by Peter Hesselbach. Just 2½ weeks after the first flight, on 29 April 1937, the further development of both the Ju 89 and the Dornier Do 19 was cancelled by the RLM. The reason for this step was the high fuel consumption of heavy bombers, as well as because a large number of bombers could only be manufactured if these bombers were medium bombers, like the Ju 88.

===Second prototype===
Junkers completed the second Ju 89 prototype D-ALAT July 1937. Junkers used both prototypes for extensive flight tests to get experience of the stability and flight controls of large aircraft, but the third prototype V3 was stopped after the programme was cancelled.

On 4 June 1938, Junkers achieved a new payload/altitude world record with the second prototype D-ALAT with payload at an altitude of , ( more than a Short Stirling with the same payload). On 8 June 1938, D-ALAT reached an altitude of with . In late 1938, both aircraft were transferred to the Luftwaffe, where they were used as heavy transport aircraft.

Both Ju 89 prototypes seem to have been scrapped by the end of 1939, although some sources claim that they were still in use the following year in Norway. During testing, Luft Hansa expressed an interest in an airliner to be developed from the type, which led Junkers to rebuild the incomplete third prototype as the Ju 90.

<text>A compactor is a machine or mechanism used to reduce the size of material such as waste material or bio mass through compaction. A trash compactor is often used by business and public places like hospitals (And in the United States also by homes) to reduce the volume of trash they produce. A baler-wrapper compactor is often used for making compact and wrapped bales in order to improve logistics.

Normally powered by hydraulics, compactors take many shapes and sizes. In landfill sites for example, a large tractor (typically a converted front end loader with some variant of a bulldozer blade attached) with spiked steel wheels called a landfill compactor is used to drive over waste deposited by waste collection vehicles (WCVs).

WCVs themselves incorporate a compacting mechanism which is used to increase the payload of the vehicle and reduce the number of times it has to empty. This usually takes the form of hydraulically powered sliding plates which sweep out the collection hopper and compress the material into what has already been loaded.

Different compactors are used in scrap metal processing, the most familiar being the car crusher. Such devices can be of either the &quot;pancake&quot; type, where a scrap automobile is flattened by a huge descending hydraulically powered plate, or the baling press, where the automobile is compressed from several directions until it resembles a large cube

==Commercial use==

Many retail and service businesses, such as fast food, restaurants, and hotels, use compactors to reduce the volume of non-recyclable waste as well as curb nuisance such as rodents and smell. In the hospitality industry tolerance for such nuisances is particularly low. These compactors typically come in electric and hydraulic operation, with quite a few loading configurations. Most popular loading configurations fall under the following:

* Ground-access; 
* Walk-on; 
* Secured indoor chute.

These compactors are almost exclusively of welded steel construction for two reasons: durability under pressure and exposure to the elements, as compactors are installed either completely outdoors or sometimes under a covered loading dock.

== Agricultural use ==

As a means to preserve and store forage, baler-wrapper compactors are used to exclude oxygen from the forage and wrap it in air tight film. Without access to air the forage is preserved fresh for longer periods of time.

==Residential use==
In the United States, there are also trash compactors, hydraulic or manual, designed for residential use. Likewise, they reduce the volume of garbage. For example, some compactors reduce the volume of polystyrene to 1/30.

==Municipal use==
In the United States, in addition to the waste vehicle and landfill use, there are solar-powered trash compactors that can hold the equivalent of 200 gallons of trash before they need to be emptied.

The large compactors in garbage trucks can be dangerous for workers, and played a role in the US Civil Rights Movement. The 1968 Memphis sanitation strike took place when two sanitation workers were crushed to death in garbage compactors, after which 700 of their 1300 black coworkers decided to strike.

== Recycling and energy ==
Baler-wrapper compactors are used for efficient storage and transport of materials like RDF (refuse-derived fuel) and bin waste, as well as compost and saw dust, enabling higher rates of recycling.

==Construction industry==
In construction, there are three main types of compactor: the plate, the rammer, and the road roller. The roller type compactors are used for compacting crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor, vibrating plate, or tamper, has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the rammer compactor has a smaller foot. The rammer, or trench rammer, is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have vibrating rollers.

In plates and rollers, the vibration is provided by rapidly rotating eccentric masses. In smaller plates, the vibration causes a tendency to move forwards, while some larger plates are provided with a directional control. In the rammer the foot is mounted on a sleeve that slides vertically in the leg. Inside the sleeve, a piston is driven up and down by the engine through a reduction gear, crank and connecting rod. Substantial coil springs above and below the piston connect it to the sliding sleeve. The connection between the sleeve and foot is at a small angle so that the whole rammer leans away from the operator. The vibrating motion is therefore slightly off the vertical, and this gives the rammer a tendency to &#x27;walk&#x27; forwards. The sliding joint in the leg is protected by a flexible bellows. 

In England the name &quot;wacker plate&quot; or just &quot;wacker&quot; is commonly used to refer to plate compactors, derived from the name of Wacker Neuson, a well-known manufacturer of such devices. The name is pronounced in the English style as &quot;whacker,&quot; as opposed to the correct German &quot;vacker&quot;. A rammer is colloquially referred to as &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Motorbike&quot;, due to the traditional resource of Irish construction labourers, and the way that the operator appears to &quot;ride&quot; the hammer holding the handles like a motorcycle.
