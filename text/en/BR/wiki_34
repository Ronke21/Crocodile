<text>Americana () is a municipality (&quot;município&quot;) located in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. The population is 237,240 (2022 Census) in an area of . The original settlement developed around the local railway station, founded in 1875, and the development of a cotton weaving factory in a nearby farm.

After 1866, thousands of former Confederate sympathizers from the American Civil War settled in the region. Following the Civil War, slavery was abolished in the United States. In Brazil, however, slavery was legal until 1888, making it a particularly attractive location to former Confederates, among whom was a former member of the Alabama State Senate, William Hutchinson Norris.

Around three hundred of the &quot;Confederados&quot; are members of the &quot;Fraternidade Descendência Americana&quot; (Fraternity of American Descendants). They meet quarterly at the Campo Cemetery.

The city was known as &quot;Vila dos Americanos&quot; (&quot;Village of the Americans&quot;) until 1904, when it belonged to the city of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste. It became a district in 1924 and a municipality in 1953.

Americana has several museums and tourist attractions, including the &quot;Pedagogic Historical Museum&quot; and the &quot;Contemporary Art Museum&quot;.

Rio Branco Esporte Clube, founded in 1913, is the football (soccer) club of the city. The team plays their home matches at Estádio Décio Vitta, which has a maximum capacity of 15,000 people.

==History==
The first records on the occupation of the lands where Americana now stands date from the late 18th century, when Domingos da Costa Machado I acquired a crown property between the municipalities of Vila Nova da Constituição (now Piracicaba) and Vila de São Carlos (now Campinas). In that area several estates were created, including Salto Grande, Machadinho, and Palmeiras.

A part of the property, which included the Machadinho estate, was sold by Domingos da Costa Machado II to Antônio Bueno Rangel. After Rangel&#x27;s death, the estate was divided between his sons José and Basílio Bueno Rangel. A part of the property was afterwards sold to the captain of the Brazilian National Guard, Ignácio Corrêa Pacheco, who is considered the founder of Americana.

===Confederate immigration===
In 1866, the region started to be populated with American immigrants from the former Confederate States of America, who were fleeing the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Emperor Dom Pedro II was a fierce advocate of the South during the war, and openly recruited the former Confederates, offering free transport, cheap land, and an easy path to citizenship.

The first immigrant to arrive was the lawyer and ex-state senator from Alabama, colonel William Hutchinson Norris. Norris installed himself in lands near the seat of the Machadinho estate and the Quilombo River.

Norris was to investigate and report on Brazil and as a possible new home for Confederates who no longer wanted to live in the United States. His report was positive, and in 1867 the rest of his family arrived in Brazil, accompanied by other families from the Confederate States. These families settled in the region, bringing agricultural innovations and a kind of watermelon known as &quot;Georgia&#x27;s rattlesnake&quot;. Between 8,000 and 20,000 former Confederates emigrated to Brazil (not all to this one town). Slaves were inexpensive in Brazil, one noted, and at least 54 families bought 536 slaves after arrival in Brazil.

In 1875, almost a decade after the arrival of the Confederate immigrants in the region, the Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro completed the expansion of its main railway to the city of Rio Claro. A station was built within the lands of the Machadinho estate. Despite belonging to the municipality of Campinas, the station was made to serve the estates in the municipality of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste, which was further away and had no station of its own.

The inauguration of the station counted the Emperor Dom Pedro II and Gaston, comte d&#x27;Eu among those who attended. The station was baptized &quot;Santa Bárbara station&quot;. It is unknown exactly when the small village became the city of Americana, but it is known that this village was created by the time of the inauguration of the railway station, and that it was Ignácio Corrêa Pacheco who distributed the lands. Pacheco is thus considered the founder of the city. The municipal holiday of Americana is still August 27, the day when the railway station was inaugurated.

The small town formed around the station was named &quot;Villa da Estação de Santa Bárbara&quot; (Santa Bárbara Station Town). Its inhabitants consisted mainly of American families, and the town became thus popularly known as &quot;Villa dos Americanos&quot; (Town of the Americans).

The similarity between the official name of the town and the one of the neighboring municipality frequently caused serious communication problems, such as mail to Santa Bárbara Station often being shipped to the municipality of Santa Bárbara, away. In order to solve the problem, the railway company changed the name of the station in 1900 to &quot;Estação de Villa Americana&quot; (American Town Station). The name of the town itself was then also officially changed to &quot;Villa Americana&quot; (American Town).

The official song of the city says, in part:

&lt;poem&gt;The many Confederates
brought us
the wheelbarrow, watermelon,
cotton and the plow.&lt;/poem&gt;

The city celebrates an annual Confederate festival, named the &quot;Festa Confederada&quot;. The Confederate flag is prominently displayed, and men dress as Confederate soldiers.

===Carioba===
In the 1890s, the farm known as &quot;Fazenda Salto Grande&quot; was purchased by the American Clement Willmot. Willmot established the first industry in Americana under the name Clement H. Willmot &amp; Cia. In 1889, the factory was renamed &quot;Fábrica de Tecidos Carioba&quot; (Carioba Textile Factory). The name &quot;Carioba&quot; derives from the Tupi words for &quot;white cloth&quot;.

The factory ran into financial trouble after the abolition of slavery in 1888, and was purchased by German immigrants who were members of the Müller family. The town of Carioba sprang up around the factory. German immigrants brought European-style urbanization to Carioba which is reflected in the style of its manors, factories, hotels, and schools. Asphalt of tar was then first imported from Europe into Americana and utilized in road paving. The factory became the basis for the present-day &quot;Parque Industrial de Americana&quot; (Industrial Park of Americana).

===Italian immigration===
On October 8, 1887, Joaquim Boer led a large group of Italian immigrants to Brazil. At Americana these Italian immigrants built their first church in 1896, dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua, who eventually became the patron saint of the city. Born in Portugal, and called Saint Anthony of Lisbon there, the saint who is among the three June popular saints in the Catholic calendar (the others being Saints John the Baptist and Peter) is celebrated on June 13 with typical Junine countryside Brazilian food, prayers of the rosary, square dance, liquor, and bonfire.

Although immigrants got incentives to come to Brazil, Italians who arrived before that did not seem to have enjoyed special privileges. They often lived within the quarters designed for enslaved Africans who also suffered from lack of comfort and healthy conditions. Those immigrants worked as indentured servants, paying off their debts to farmers who had paid for their tickets and were exploited, until the system was revamped and improved. Their descendants went on to become laborers, merchants, and professionals.

===Elihu Root&#x27;s visit===
In 1906, two years after the creation of the Distrito de Paz de Villa Americana, the municipality received a visit from Elihu Root, United States Secretary of State, who had been attending and presiding over the Pan-American Conference held in Rio de Janeiro. After the conference, Root visited other parts of Brazil (such as Araras), and was informed of the existence of Americana. Root expressed interest in visiting the town, and was received at Americana with great emotion and affection. Hundreds of the residents received Root at nighttime.

===Autonomy===
With the change in status from village to district, Americana developed rapidly. Its first police force was created, a sub prefecture was established, and three street lights – lit by kerosene and brought from Germany – were introduced. A school was also established, with the sending of the educator Silvino José de Oliveira to represent Americana&#x27;s interests with the state government. All of these developments led the local inhabitants to clamor for the status of a city.

In 1922, Villa Americana was one of the most progressive districts in Campinas with a population of 4,500. In this year, the fight to change its status to city began, led by Antonio Lobo and others, such as Lieutenant Antas de Abreu, Cícero Jones and Hermann Müller himself. Their efforts finally bore fruit: on November 12, 1924, the Municipality of Villa Americana was created, comprising two districts: Villa Americana and Nova Odessa, Nova Odessa later becoming its own municipality.

===Constitutionalist Revolution and economic development===
At the time of the beginning of the Getúlio Vargas dictatorship in Brazil in 1930, Americana was undergoing a profound economic transformation due to the rise of the textile industry there (the city was known as the &quot;Rayon Capital&quot;).

In 1932, during the administration of Mayor Antonio Zanaga, the revolt known as the Constitutionalist Revolution erupted against Vargas&#x27; regime. Americana sent volunteers to this revolution, and three of them, Jorge Jones, Fernando de Camargo and Aristeu Valente (from Nova Odessa, then part of Americana), perished during the struggle. Their sacrifice is remembered in Americana to this day.

In 1938, Mayor Zanaga changed the name of the town from Villa Americana to Americana, and due to the economic transformation of the town, the Comarca of Americana was created on December 31, 1953, during the administration of Mayor Jorge Arbix. In 1959, during the administration of Mayor Abrahim Abraham, Nova Odessa was made autonomous as its own municipality.

Between 1960 and 1970, the rapid development of Americana led many people to move there in search of work. Because of its size, there was not enough room to accommodate the new residents and many lived on the border of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste and Americana, creating what is known today as &quot;Zona Leste de Santa Bárbara&quot; (East Santa Barbara).

The same also occurred because the majority of the population were unaware of the location where one municipality ended and where another began. The confusion came about because municipal limits were not yet fully determined. The problem was solved with the creation of a major avenue, today called Avenida da Amizade (Friendship Avenue), which became the dividing line.

At the same time as these developments, some problems were also created. The sudden increase in population caused an imbalance in the public accounts of the municipality, which was not ready for such a great number of new residents.

<text>Sir Cyril Astley Clarke (22 August 1907 – 21 November 2000) was a British physician, geneticist and lepidopterist. He was honoured for his pioneering work on prevention of Rh disease of the newborn, and also for his work on the genetics of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).

==Biography==
Cyril Clarke was born on 22 August 1907 in Leicester, England and received his school education at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, Leicester and at the independent Oundle School near Peterborough. His interest in butterflies and moths began at school. His studied natural science at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating in 1929, and then medicine at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London, graduating in 1932. During the Second World War he worked as a medical specialist in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the war Clarke worked as a registrar at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and then as Consultant Physician at the United Liverpool Hospitals. In 1963 he was appointed Director of the Nuffield Unit of Medical Genetics based at the University of Liverpool and two years later was made Professor of Medicine. He held these posts until his retirement in 1972. In retirement he served as President of the Royal College of Physicians (1972–1977)

Clarke helped to develop the technique of giving Rh-negative women inter-muscular injections of anti-RhD antibodies during pregnancy to prevent Rh disease in their newborn babies. This was one of the major advances in preventive medicine in the second half of the 20th century.

Clarke answered an advert in the Bulletin of the Amateur Entomologists’ Society for swallowtail butterfly pupae that had been placed by Philip Sheppard. They met and began working together in their common interest of lepidoptery. From 1959 they started running a moth trap in Caldy Common near West Kirby, Wirral, England. They studied the peppered moth, the scarlet tiger moth and swallowtail butterfly. They published papers on the genetics of Lepidoptera and also on Rh disease. Clarke continued research in his retirement and in 1988 he rediscovered a scarlet tiger moth colony on the Wirral Way, West Kirby, that had been started in 1961 by Philip Sheppard. The colony was useful for study of the genetics of changes in populations.

He married Frieda (or Féo) in 1934. Lady Clarke died in 1998. Cyril Clarke died in 2000. They had three sons, one of whom is a consultant neurologist.

<text>William Banting (&quot;c.&quot; December 1796 – 16 March 1878) was a notable English undertaker. Formerly obese, he is also known for being the first to popularise a weight loss diet based on limiting the intake of carbohydrates, especially those of a starchy or sugary nature. He undertook his dietary changes at the suggestion of Soho Square physician William Harvey, who in turn had learned of this type of diet, but in the context of diabetes management, from attending lectures in Paris by Claude Bernard.

==Professional career==
In the early 19th century, the family business of William Banting of St. James&#x27;s Street, London, was among the most eminent companies of funeral directors in Britain. As funeral directors to the Royal Household itself, the Banting family conducted the funerals of King George III in 1820, King George IV in 1830, the Duke of Gloucester in 1834, the Duke of Wellington in 1852, Prince Albert in 1861, Prince Leopold in 1884, Queen Victoria in 1901, and King Edward VII in 1910. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family eventually ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westbrook Banting.

==Weight loss diet==

===&quot;Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public&quot;===
In 1863, Banting wrote a pamphlet, called &quot;Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public&quot;, which contained the particular plan for the diet he followed. It was written as an open letter in the form of a personal testimonial. Banting accounted all of his unsuccessful fasts, diets, spa and exercise regimens in his past. His previously unsuccessful attempts had been on the advice of various medical experts. He then described the dietary change which finally had worked for him, following the advice of another medical expert.
&quot;My kind and valued medical adviser is not a doctor for obesity, but stands on the pinnacle of fame in the treatment of another malady, which, as he well knows, is frequently induced by [corpulence].&quot; (p24)
His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, saccharine matter, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting&#x27;s pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets. Initially, he published the booklet at his personal expense. The self-published edition was so popular that he determined to sell it to the general public. Despite the success of the booklet, Banting opted to forgo profits from the self-published versions, instead donating the profits to charity.
The third and later editions were published by Harrison, London. Banting&#x27;s booklet remains in print as of 2007, and is still available on-line.

==&quot;Banting&quot; as a verb==
The popularity of the pamphlet mentioned above was such that the questions &quot;Do you bant?&quot; or &quot;Are you banting?&quot;, still occasionally in use today, refer to his method, and sometimes even to dieting in general. In Swedish, &quot;banta&quot; is still the main verb for &quot;being on a diet&quot;. Scientist Tim Noakes popularised Banting in South Africa when he named his high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet after Banting.
==Legacy==
Gary Taubes&#x27; study of carbohydrates, &quot;Good Calories, Bad Calories&quot;, begins with a prologue entitled &quot;A brief history of Banting&quot; and discusses Banting at some length. Discussions of low-carbohydrate diets often begin with a discussion of Banting.

==Personal life==
Banting was a distant relative of Sir Frederick Banting, the co-discoverer of insulin. Banting is buried alongside his wife and daughter at Brompton Cemetery, London, England.

<text>Seil (; , ) is one of the Slate Islands, located on the east side of the Firth of Lorn, southwest of Oban, in Scotland. Seil has been linked to the mainland by bridge since the late 18th century.

The origins of the island&#x27;s name are unclear and probably pre-Gaelic. It was a part of the kingdom of Dalriada in the 7th century but by the 16th century, Seil seemed to have been primarily agricultural in nature. It became part of the estates of the Breadalbane family and in the early 18th century they began to exploit the rich potential of the Neoproterozoic slate beds. The excavations from the island&#x27;s quarries were exported all over the world during the course of the next two centuries. Today, the economy is largely dependent on agriculture and tourism.

The &quot;dangerous seas&quot; of the Firth of Lorn have claimed many lives and there are several shipwrecks in the vicinity of Seil. Kilbrandon Church has fine examples of stained glass windows and an association with St Brendan.

==Etymology==
There is some linguistic continuity between the earliest and modern names for many of the larger islands surrounding Scotland. However, the derivations of many of these names are obscure &quot;suggesting that they were coined very early on, some perhaps by the earliest settlers after the Ice Age.&quot; Even when names used both in the historic past and the present have some apparent meaning this may indicate a phonetic resemblance to an older name, but one that may be &quot;so old and so linguistically and lexically opaque that we do not have any plausible referents for them.&quot; 

The &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;, which was compiled by an anonymous cleric in Ravenna around AD 700, mentions various Scottish island names. This document frequently used maps as a source of information and it has been possible to speculate about their modern equivalents based on assumptions about voyages made by early travellers 300–400 years prior to its creation. The island of mentioned in this list may refer to Seil.

Seil is probably a pre-Gaelic name, although a case has been made for a Norse derivation. It has also been argued that Seil could be the location of Hinba, an island associated with St Columba. Reasons include the island&#x27;s association with St Brendan, its location on an inshore trade route from Antrim to the north and its suitability for a substantial settlement. The (great sea bag) referred to in texts about Hinba could refer to the Seil Sound and narrows at Clachan Bridge where the &quot;bag&quot; captures the rapidly flowing water that floods under the bridge. Rae, equating &quot;Hinba&quot; with the Gaelic , notes that the adjacent mainland parish of Kilninver means &quot;church of Inbhir&quot; and suggests that the derivation of &quot;Seil&quot; may be of Scandinavian origin with similarities to the East Frisian place name or meaning a &quot;seep or passage of water&quot;. This, he proposes, could have been a Norse interpretation of Hinba/Inbhir. However, Mac an Tàilleir notes that Kilninver or &quot;appears to mean &#x27;church by the river mouth&#x27;, and an older form of , &#x27;Finbar&#x27;s church&#x27; appears&quot;.

It has also been suggested that Seil may be the referred to in the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, which records a victory of the Scots over a Viking force during the time of Donald II in the 9th century. The name used in the 12th century &quot;Book of Leinster&quot; is .

The earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was undertaken by Donald Monro in his &quot;Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot; of 1549 in which Seil is listed. The modern spelling of &quot;Seil&quot; also appears in the 1654 &quot;Blaeu Atlas of Scotland&quot;.

==Geography==
Seil is separated from mainland Scotland by the Clachan Sound, which is only about at its narrowest point. To the west lies the sea-lane of the Firth of Lorn. The island of Luing lies across the Cuan Sound to the south and beyond are Lunga and Scarba. Smaller islands surrounding Seil are its companion Slate Islands of Easdale, Torsa, Belnahua and Shuna. Eilean Dubh Mòr is to the south-west with the Garvellachs beyond, with Insh to the north west.

Seil forms part of Nether Lorn, a region of Argyll between Loch Awe and Loch Melfort that includes the offshore islands located in the modern council area of Argyll and Bute. The highest point on the island is the summit of Meall Chaise at above sea level.

Seil is some miles from Oban, travelling north by road along the B844 and A 816.

Balvicar, in the centre of the island, is the main settlement and has a harbour with commercial fishing boats, the island shop, and a golf club. On the west side of the island lies the former slate-mining village of Ellenabeich. This village, known for its white slate worker&#x27;s cottages, has attracted an &quot;artist&#x27;s colony&quot; and has a number of holiday cottages.

There are three other small settlements; Cuan at the southern tip, Oban Seil north of Balvicar and Clachan Seil, which is closest to the Clachan Bridge.

== Geology ==
The larger part of the bedrock of Seil is provided by the Neoproterozoic age Easdale Slate Formation, a pyritic, graphitic pelite belonging to the Easdale Subgroup of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Zones of metamorphosed intrusive igneous rocks occur within the southeast of the island. Andesitic lavas of the Lorn Plateau Lava Formation dominate the west of the island. Seil is cut by numerous NW-SE aligned basalt and microgabbro dykes which form a part of the ‘Mull Swarm’ which is of early Palaeogene age.
Raised marine deposits of sand and gravel occur widely around the margins of the island, a legacy of late Quaternary changes in relative sea-level.

==History==

The Cenél Loairn kindred controlled what is today known as Lorn in the kingdom of Dalriada. The 7th-century separates the Cenél Loairn into three subsidiary groups, of which the Cenél Salaich may have controlled Nether Lorn.

In the mid-16th century Monro wrote of Seil: &quot;&quot;

Ardfad Castle is a ruin in the northwest of Seil. It was the home of the Macdougalls of Ardencaple, but following the failure of King James VII to regain the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland in the late 17th century the Macdougalls lost much of their lands to the Duke of Argyll. The castle was &quot;a well-built structure of stone and lime, occupying a prominent situation on a crag and tail, not unlike Edinburgh Castle rock. In 1915, it was still fairly well preserved, with the walls standing to some height and two round corner towers&quot;. However, by 1971 only the remains of the southwest round tower survived.

Seil then became part of the Netherlorn estates of the Breadalbane family (a branch of Clan Campbell) until the 20th century when their land was sold off as smaller farms and individual houses. In the early 16th century Muriel, daughter of the Thane of Calder, married Sir John Campbell, son of the Earl of Argyll at Inverary and so Clan Campbell of Cawdor was founded. &quot;Many renowned and some infamous&quot; clan members are buried at Kilbrandon churchyard on Seil. From the late 17th century the Dukes of Argyll began to lease land on a competitive basis rather than as a means of strengthening the welfare of their senior clansmen. This resulted in mass evictions from Seil and the surrounding area in 1669, long before the clearances as such.

===Slate quarrying===
In 1730 Colin Campbell of Carwhin was appointed as the Captain of Ardmaddy and tasked with exploiting the area&#x27;s natural resources. At this time Easdale slate had been used from as early as the 12th century using seasonal labour from the Ardmaddy estate. In 1745 Campbell created the Easdale Marble and Slate Company in order to place extractions from the area on a more commercial basis. At that point Easdale was producing 1 million slates per annum; when Thomas Pennant visited two years later production had increased by 250% and as further quarries were opened this further increased the company&#x27;s production to 5 million per annum by 1800.

The little island of Eilean-a-beithich between Seil and Easdale was quarried down to a depth of and other slate quarries were opened on Luing and at Balvicar. Railway lines were laid to take the rock from the quarries to nearby harbours. Peak production was reached in the 1860s at 9 million slates per annum, with export destinations including England, Nova Scotia, the West Indies, the US, Norway and New Zealand. The 6th Earl of Breadalbane had less interest in the industry than his predecessors although during the time of the 7th Earl a new quarry was opened at Ardencaple. However, disaster struck in 1881. In the early morning of 22 November a severe gale from the south-west wind and an exceptionally high tide flooded the quarries on Easdale and at Eilean-a-beithich &quot;a large rocky buttress which supported a sea wall gave way under the excessive pressure of water&quot;. Eilean-a-beithich was never re-opened although production did continue at Easdale, Luing and Balvicar. Changes in demand - clay tiles were rapidly replacing slate as the roofing material of choice - led to commercial production ceasing by 1911. Balvicar quarry re-opened from the late 1940s until the early 1960s but slate is no longer mined anywhere in the Slate Islands.

==Economy and transport==

Today, the island&#x27;s commerce is largely dependent on agriculture, tourism and lobster fishing. The Ellenabeich Heritage Centre which opened in 2000, is run by the Slate Islands Heritage Trust. Located in a former slate quarry-worker&#x27;s cottage, the centre has displays about life in the 19th century, slate quarrying and the local flora, fauna and geology.
Seil has been linked to the Scottish mainland since 1792/3 when the Clachan Bridge was built by engineer Robert Mylne. Also known as the &quot;Bridge Over the Atlantic&quot;, the bridge was constructed with a span and has an arch above the sea bed in order to allow small craft of up to to pass under it.

Ferries sail from Ellenabeich to Easdale, and from Cuan to Luing across the Cuan Sound. This stretch of water is only wide but the spring tides race through it at up to . The Easdale ferry uses a chain and cog wheels designed by John Whyte in the mid 19th century.

==Religion==

Seil is associated with the 6th century saint Brendan of Clonfert who established a monastery on the Garvellachs and at a later date a cell on the site of Kilbrandon Church to which he gave his name. The modern church, located between Balvicar and Cuan, has five stained glass windows by Douglas Strachan illustrating scenes from the Sea of Galilee. The central window depicts a ship in distress and &quot;the portrayal in glowing colour of the storm&#x27;s sweep, the crew&#x27;s terror, and Christ&#x27;s self-possession, has a lively drama unique in Highland stained glass&quot;.

==Folklore and media==

The well-known pub Tigh an Truish (Gaelic for &#x27;house of the trousers&#x27;) at Clachan Seil is said to have obtained its name in the wake of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. Supposedly, shore-going islanders swapped their kilts for trousers here after Highland dress was banned.

Parts of &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; were filmed on Seil.

==Notable people==

Alexander Beith, Free Church Moderator, spent about 4 years in this parish.
Arthur Murray, 3rd Viscount Elibank and his wife, the actress Faith Celli, purchased property on Seil in the 1930s. They converted a row of derelict cottages into a substantial dwelling and created the garden at An Cala, near Ellanabeich.

The artist C. John Taylor lived at Ellanabeich for many years until his death in 1998. His painting of the Clachan Bridge &quot;Bridge Over The Atlantic&quot; sold nearly a million copies.

Frances Shand Kydd, the mother of Diana, Princess of Wales, lived on the island for many years until her death in 2004.

==Shipwrecks==
The Firth of Lorn is the seaway used by vessels going to and from Oban and Fort William from points south and the seas around Seil contain the sites of various shipwrecks.

The wooden sailing ship &quot;Norval&quot; ran aground in fog near the southern tip of Insh on 20 September 1870. The wreckage was still visible in 1995. On 15 August 1900 the iron steamship &quot;Apollo&quot; ran aground on Bono Reef south west of Seil. She was carrying a cargo of granite cobble stones from Aberdeen to Newport. The wreck lies in a gully some down amidst thick kelp. In February 1933 the Clyde puffer &quot;Hafton&quot; en route from Toboronochy on Luing to Mull sprung a leak and foundered about into the journey. The crew of five took to a small boat and reached Ellanabeich safely. A wreck of unknown provenance has been recorded east of Rubha Garbh Airde at the northern end of Seil.

==Wildlife ==

In early summer the Clachan Bridge is covered in fairy foxgloves (&quot;Erinus alpinus&quot;). The narrows that the bridge spans trapped a whale with a long lower jaw in 1835 and no fewer than 192 pilot whales in 1837, the largest of which was long.

According to wildlife experts the entire badger population of the island may have been deliberately exterminated in 2007. Forty of the animals, whose setts were believed to be long established, may have been gassed to death, according to the police. The police also expressed concerns that two golden eagles and one white-tailed sea eagle have been found poisoned near Seil in recent years, involving use of the banned substance carbofuran.

<text>The Temple of Elemental Evil is an adventure module for the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, set in the game&#x27;s &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting. The module was published by TSR, Inc. in 1985 for the first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. It was written by Gary Gygax and Frank Mentzer, and is an expansion of an earlier Gygax module, The Village of Hommlet (TSR, 1979). &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; is also the title of a related 2001 Thomas M. Reid novel and an Atari computer game.

&quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; was ranked the 4th greatest Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure of all time by &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.

==Plot summary==

In the module T1 &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot;, the player characters must defeat the raiders operating out of a ruined fort nearby, and thereafter the characters can use Hommlet as a base for their adventures. The adventure begins in the village of Hommlet, situated near the site of a past battle against evil forces operating from the Temple. The adventurers travel through Hommlet and are drawn into a web of conspiracy and deception.

The module is intended for first-level characters, who begin the adventure &quot;weary, weak, and practically void of money&quot;. They travel to a town with a reputation as having a great opportunity to earn fortunes and to defeat enemy creatures, but also to lose one&#x27;s life. While the town initially appears hospitable, the characters soon learn that many of its inhabitants are powerful spies for minions of evil.

The T1 adventure stands alone, but also forms the first part of T1–4. In &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, the characters begin at a low level, and after establishing themselves in Hommlet, they explore the vast dungeons beneath the Temple, thereby earning experience. T1 culminates in a ruined moathouse where agents secretly plan to re-enter the Temple and free the demoness Zuggtmoy, imprisoned therein. &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; module has been described as a beginner&#x27;s scenario, which starts in the village, and leads to a nearby dungeon, while &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; continues the adventure. In the next section, T2, the adventurers move on to the nearby village of Nulb to confront several nefarious opponents, including agents from the Temple. Based on the outcome of these encounters, the player characters can then enter the Temple itself to interact with its many denizens and test their mettle against Zuggtmoy herself.

===History of the temple===
The temple referenced in the module&#x27;s title is an unholy structure located in the central Flanaess not far from the city-state of Verbobonc. In 566 CY, forces of evil from Dyvers or the Wild Coast constructed a small chapel outside the nearby village of Nulb. The chapel was quickly built into a stone temple from which bandits and evil humanoids began to operate with increasing frequency.

In 569 CY, a combined force was sent to destroy the Temple and put an end to the marauding. This allied army clashed with a horde of evil men and humanoids, including orcs, ogres and gnolls, at the Battle of Emridy Meadows. Men-at-arms from Furyondy and Veluna united with dwarves from the Lortmils, gnomes from the Kron Hills, and an army of elven archers to face the threat of the Horde of Elemental Evil, consisting largely of savage humanoids such as orcs, ogres, and gnolls. The arrival of the elves from the shadows of the Gnarley Forest turned the tide of battle, trapping the savage humanoids against a bend in the Velverdyva where they were routed and slaughtered.

At some point in this battle, Serten, cleric of Saint Cuthbert and member of the Citadel of Eight, was slain. The Citadel was notable for its absence at this pivotal moment in the history of the Flanaess, and their failure to take part in the Battle of Emridy Meadows contributed to the group&#x27;s decline and eventual disbandment.

After dispersing the Horde of Elemental Evil, the allied forces laid siege to the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, defeating it within a fortnight. Spellcasters loyal to the goodly army cooperated on a spell of sealing that bound the demoness Zuggtmoy (a major instigator in the Horde of Elemental Evil) to some of the deepest chambers in the castle&#x27;s dungeons.

The site itself remained, however, and over the following decade rumors of evil presence there persisted. The Viscount of Verbobonc and the Archcleric of Veluna became increasingly concerned, and cooperated to build a small castle outside the Village of Hommlet to guard against the possibility of the Temple rising again.

For the next five years, Hommlet gained in wealth thanks to adventurers who came to the area seeking out remnants of evil to slay. Things quieted down for another four years as the area returned to peace and normalcy, but in 578 CY evil began to stir again, with groups of bandits riding the roads. In 579 CY, the events in the T1–4 module occur.

&quot;Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; is set 12 years later, in 591 CY.

==Publication history==
The adventure module &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; was a 24-page booklet designed by Gary Gygax, and published by TSR in 1979. The original printing featured an outer folder and a two-color cover; the book was reprinted in 1981 with a color cover. &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; was originally intended to bear the module code T2 and serve as a true sequel to &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot;. Gygax began writing T2 soon after the publication of T1, but often stopped to work on other products, such as &quot;The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot; (Gygax 1981). The T2 version was never completed, and no module bearing the codes T3 or T4 was ever independently published. Instead, the material for the sequel was combined in 1985 with the original T1 storyline and published as an integrated adventure bearing the module code T1-4.

The original printings of T1 featured monochrome cover art by David A. Trampier, who also contributed interior art along with David C. Sutherland III. The 1981 and subsequent printings of T1 featured a new color cover painting by Jeff Dee surrounded by a lime green border. The expanded T1-4 book from 1985 features cover art by Keith Parkinson and interior art by Jeff Butler, Clyde Caldwell, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, Parkinson, and Trampier.

T1-4 &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; was written by Gary Gygax with Frank Mentzer, and published by TSR in 1985, incorporating T1 &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot;. Gygax gave his notes for The Temple to Frank Mentzer who used them to design &quot;T1-4, The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, which was released in 1985. The module was a 128-page book with a 16-page map booklet, and featured a cover by Keith Parkinson and interior illustrations by Jeff Butler, Clyde Caldwell, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, and Dave Trampier. The module includes descriptions of two towns, the Temple itself, and four large dungeon levels.

Although initially written as a stand-alone series, T1-4 was made to dovetail into A1-4 &quot;Scourge of the Slave Lords&quot; when these two campaigns were revised in 1986 as supermodules. The combined campaign then culminates with the GDQ series, incorporating modules G1-G3 &quot;Against the Giants&quot;; D1-D3, which introduced D&amp;D fans to drow elves for the first time; and finally Q1, &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot;, in which the heroes fight against the spider demon Lolth herself. These last adventures were also combined and republished as a supermodule bearing the code GDQ1-7, &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot;.

In 2001, Wizards of the Coast published a novel by Thomas M. Reid also bearing the title &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;.

Wizards of the Coast also published a sequel to the T1-4 adventure in 2001, the 3rd Edition module &quot;Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;.

Wizards of the Coast published a remake of &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; adventure for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition and released it through the RPGA.

The original TSR product code for module T1 (bluetone and full color cover) is 9026.

==Reception==
Kirby T. Griffis reviewed &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; in 1981, in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; #35. Griffis found it a very playable module, noting that the module could be very fun if run by a good DM. Griffis commented: &quot;Players &#x27;get into&#x27; their roles, the thieves stealing from the revellers at the inn, the fighters getting drunk under the table.&quot; He also found the map to be well-keyed, and noted that important buildings have floor plans mapped out. Commenting on the imbalance of power, he noted that &quot;some of the evil spies are entirely too powerful for the party to tackle, and the local high level good characters are hardly ever interested in aiding the adventurers.&quot; Overall, Griffis found &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; to be a very good introductory adventure, and recommended it as an introduction to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

In a retrospective review of &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Bob Byrne said &quot;Gygax packs in a TON of information into this module. Hommlet is brought to life and the Moathouse is ready to run. And with the history, there&#x27;s room for growth (The Temple). So, it&#x27;s ready to go &#x27;off the shelf.&#x27; But there&#x27;s also space for the GM to create as well. If the players want to mix in role play, the GM has a lot to work with. You could run quite a few sessions without any adventuring at all.&quot;

===Legacy===

&quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; was ranked the 4th greatest &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure of all time by &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game.

&quot;Dungeon Master for Dummies&quot; listed &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; as one of the ten best classic adventures, calling it &quot;the grandfather of all huge dungeon crawls&quot;.

Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, says of &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, &quot;If you like huge classic dungeon crawls, this is probably the best of the lot.&quot;

John ONeill for &quot;Black Gate&quot;, said &quot;&quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; may be Gary Gygax&#x27;s crowning achievement as a dungeon designer. It was the last major adventure he designed for TSR and — at 128 pages — was by far the largest and most ambitious.&quot; Commenting on &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, James Maliszewski said &quot;I consider the &#x27;incomplete&#x27; nature of &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; to be a positive thing that inadvertently encouraged me to spread my wings as a fledgling referee. Far from stifling my creativity, this module fostered it.&quot; Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; commented that &quot;Although expertly covered by artist Keith Parkinson, the remainder of &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; veritably screams that it was birthed in a maelstrom of financial panic and leadership void.&quot;

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2015 rated &quot;Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; as #3 in &quot;The Top 10 Campaign Adventure Module Series of All Time, saying &quot;I can attest that it is truly one of the greatest campaigns you can take players on, period.&quot;

==In other media==
=== Computer games ===

In 2003 a computer game, &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, based on the original T1-4 module was released. It was developed by Troika Games and published by Atari. It remains the only &quot;D&amp;D&quot; related computer game set in the original &quot;Greyhawk&quot; setting.

In an update to the game, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot; has made an in-game version of the adventure. In the same month that DDO&#x27;s update went live, the online D&amp;D game &quot;Neverwinter&quot; also released an in-game version of the Temple of Elemental Evil.

===Board games===
Wizards of the Coast published the &quot;Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game&quot; in 2015.

<text>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA; ; ) is the revenue service of the Canadian federal government, and most provincial and territorial governments. The CRA collects taxes, administers tax law and policy, and delivers benefit programs and tax credits. Legislation administered by the CRA includes the &quot;Income Tax Act,&quot; parts of the &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;, and parts of laws relating to the Canada Pension Plan, employment insurance (EI), tariffs and duties. The agency also oversees the registration of charities in Canada, and enforces much of the country&#x27;s tax laws.

From 1867 to 1999, tax services and programs were administered by the Department of National Revenue, otherwise known as Revenue Canada. In 1999, Revenue Canada was reorganized into the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA). In 2003, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was created out of the CCRA, leading to customs being dropped from the agency&#x27;s mandate and the agency&#x27;s current name.

The CRA is the largest organization in the Canadian federal public service by number of personnel, employing 54,933 people and has an operating budget of $5.1 billion as of the 2018–19 fiscal year. The agency&#x27;s headquarters are based in Ottawa, itself divided into five program branches, which directly support the CRA&#x27;s core responsibilities, and seven corporate branches, which deliver internal services within the organization. The CRA also has operations throughout the rest of Canada, including 4 Tax Centres (TCs), 3 National Verifications and Collections Centres (NVCCs), and 25 Tax Services Offices (TSOs), organized into four regions: Atlantic, Ontario, Quebec, and Western.

During the 2017 tax year, the CRA collected approximately $430 billion in revenue on behalf of federal and provincial governments, and administered nearly $34 billion in benefits to Canadians.

The CRA is responsible to Parliament through the minister of national revenue (Marie Claude-Bibeau since 2023). The day-to-day operations of the agency are overseen by the commissioner of revenue (Bob Hamilton since 2016).

==History==

Prior to Confederation, the collection of taxes and customs duties was the responsibility of the Department of Customs in each of the British North American colonies. In 1867, Parliament enacted legislation which established two separate departments, Inland Revenue, and Customs. Until end of World War I, the majority of federal revenue came from customs and excise duties, but as the war effort placed increasing pressure on government finances, the Borden government introduced a personal income tax in 1917. While intended to be a temporary measure at first, the federal government has since continued to levy personal income taxes, and are now the largest source of revenue for the federal government. Both Inland Revenue and Customs were eventually merged into a single department, Customs and Excise, between 1918 and 1927.
In 1927, the &quot;Department of National Revenue Act&quot; was enacted by Parliament, which changed the name of the department from Customs and Excise to National Revenue, while retaining its earlier mandate. The Department of National Revenue would gain increasing responsibility as new social programs, such as the Canada Pension Plan, and new streams of revenue, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) were gradually introduced over the latter half of the 20th century. In 1993, EFILE was first made available to Canadian taxpayers wishing to submit their taxes electronically.

In 1999, the Chrétien government introduced legislation that would transform Revenue Canada from a department to a new agency, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. This change was intended to reduce duplication in tax administration, streamline services to Canadians, and provide the tax administration with more flexibility in corporate planning, and in forming relationships with provincial, territorial, and Indigenous governments. The CCRA was given a broad mandate that covered taxation, customs, and border protection. This arrangement only lasted until December 2003, when the Canada Border Services Agency was spun off from the CCRA due to issues relating to interdepartmental collaboration between the CCRA, Citizenship and Immigration Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on border protection and immigration enforcement.

Following the CBSA spin-off, the CCRA was rebranded as the Canada Revenue Agency, with its strategic direction pivoting towards enforcing compliance with Canada&#x27;s tax laws and delivering benefits to Canadians. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CRA joined several other government departments in transitioning to temporary remote work arrangements. The CRA also extended deadlines for filing returns and payments for the 2019 tax year. The agency was also tasked with delivering emergency financial benefits to Canadians on behalf of the federal government, processing millions of applications through its IT systems.

==Structure==

===Leadership===

The CRA is led by the minister of national revenue and the commissioner of revenue, who functions as the agency&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO).

==== Minister of National Revenue ====
The minister is accountable to Parliament and Cabinet for the CRA&#x27;s operations, and in matters pertaining to tax and benefit administration in Canada. The current minister is Marie-Claude Bibeau, who was appointed on July 26, 2023.

==== Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer ====

The commissioner is the CRA&#x27;s CEO. The commissioner manages the day-to-day operations of the agency, and advises the minister on the duties and functions of the CRA as prescribed by legislation. The current commissioner is Bob Hamilton, who was appointed to the position on August 1, 2016.

The commissioner is supported by the deputy commissioner, who fulfils specific duties and assignments provided to them by the commissioner, and acts for the commissioner in the event of absence or incapacity. The current deputy commissioner is Jean-François Fortin, who was appointed to the position on May 6, 2024.
==== Board of Management ====
The minister and commissioner are supported by the Board of Management. The Board of Management consists of 15 members appointed by the Governor in Council, of which 11 are appointed by the provinces and territories, 2 by the federal government, with the remaining seat filled by the commissioner of revenue, who is an ex-officio member of the board. Board members are typically appointed for a term of three years. The board develops the CRA&#x27;s Corporate Business Plan each year, which sets out objectives, performance expectations, and financial allocations within the agency.

The Board of Management is divided into four committees, Audit, Governance and Social Responsibility, Human Resources, and Resources, and one subcommittee, Service Transformation. These committees allow for a detailed review of items brought before the board, and establish work plans for their respective activities each year.

The Board of Management is not directly involved with the CRA&#x27;s business operations. As such, it cannot enforce or interpret legislation on behalf of the agency, and does not have access to taxpayer information.

==== Advisory committees ====
The CRA maintains four advisory committees to assist it in operational planning and decision-making as it relates to different sectors or issues. Advisory committees consist of tax professionals, lawyers, accountants, and community leaders that help the agency improve its service delivery within a specific area. The current advisory committees are as follows:

* Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector
* Audit File Resolution Committee
* Disability Advisory Committee
* Offshore Compliance Advisory Committee

===Headquarters===

The CRA&#x27;s headquarters are located in Ottawa, and is responsible for several agency-wide functions, including ministerial reporting, corporate planning, human resources, information technology, communications, and interpreting tax legislation. Headquarters is divided into five program branches, which help deliver the agency&#x27;s core mandate around tax and benefits administration, and seven corporate branches, which deliver services that support the day-to-day operations of the CRA.
=== Regions ===

Outside of its headquarters, the CRA&#x27;s operations across Canada are divided into four regions, which help to carry out the agency&#x27;s operations in different regions of the country. Each region is headed by an assistant commissioner, who oversees activities in their region, including that of tax centres (TCs) and tax services offices (TSOs) in their area of responsibility.

* Atlantic
* Ontario
* Quebec
* Western

====Tax centres (TC)====
Tax centres are responsible for intaking and processing individual and business tax returns. There are four tax centres located across Canada, each assigned their own geographic areas of responsibility, which may vary depending on the type of return:

* Jonquière Tax Centre (Quebec)
* Prince Edward Island Tax Centre (Atlantic)
* Sudbury Tax Centre (Ontario)
* Winnipeg Tax Centre (Prairie &amp; Pacific)

====Tax services offices (TSO)====
Tax services offices are field offices which handle more complex audit and collection files for the agency, generally those which involve direct interaction with taxpayers. While TSOs are present in every province, the territories do not currently have active TSOs, and are instead under the jurisdiction of TSOs located in other parts of Canada. Tax services offices are sometimes divided into branch offices for organizational purposes.

There are twenty-five TSOs situated across Canada, and are organized as follows, with any branch offices indicated in indented bullets under the corresponding TSO where applicable:
==== National Verifications and Collections Centres (NVCC) ====
National Verifications and Collections Centres are responsible for non-complex files related to collection, verification, and validation that do not involve in-person interaction. These new facilities were introduced by the agency in 2016 as part of an effort to modernize the Agency&#x27;s services. There are three NVCCs located across Canada:
* St. John&#x27;s NVCC
* Shawinigan NVCC
* Surrey NVCC

==== Northern Service Centres ====
In 2019, the CRA opened introduced Northern Service Centres to access to tax services and assistance for residents in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, co-located with existing Service Canada offices. There are three NSCs located across the North:

* Whitehorse NSC (Yukon)
* Yellowknife NSC (Northwest Territories)
* Iqaluit NSC (Nunavut)

=== Employees ===
As of the 2018-19 fiscal year, the CRA employed about 43,908 people, making it the largest organization within the federal government by personnel. Despite being headquartered in Ottawa, only about 12,000 employees are based in the National Capital Region. Of these employees, 32,598 (74.2%) were indeterminate or permanent employees, 1,251 (2.8%) were students, and 10,057 (22.9%) were contract employees. The average age of a CRA employee is 45 years old.

Under the &quot;Financial Administration Act,&quot; the CRA is designated under Schedule V as a separate agency outside of the core public administration, which allows the CRA to establish different job classifications, pay rates, and enter into labour negotiations differently from other government departments and agencies. Consequently, the job classifications used by CRA may not align with those typically used in other parts of the public service.

==== Unions ====
Executives, management, and students are generally not represented by a union. However, the majority of CRA employees are represented by Union of Taxation Employees, which is a component of Public Service Alliance of Canada. Auditors, investigators and computer systems employees are represented by Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada.

==Tax return processing==

The Canadian tax system is based on the principle of mandatory self-assessment. Taxpayers, comprising both businesses and individuals, must complete a tax return every year determine whether they owe taxes or will receive a refund. For individual tax returns, returns are generally due on April 30 for the preceding tax year. For other entities, such as charities, corporations, sole proprietorships, partnerships, or self-employed individuals, the tax deadline may vary widely.

Penalties may be imposed if returns are received after the deadline, or any outstanding amounts owed are also subject to penalties and daily compounded interest. Additionally, taxpayers that repeatedly fail to report income over several tax years, or make false statements or omissions may be subject to penalties, which may vary depending on the severity of a taxpayer&#x27;s actions.

The CRA processes most tax returns with very limited review and promptly issues a notice of assessment. The notice of assessment provides a summary of each entity&#x27;s income, credits and deductions. If a taxpayer disagrees with an assessment, they may file an appeal which may lead to challenging the assessment in tax court. Once a tax return is assessed, it may be subject to review. In some cases, a tax return could be reviewed before being assessed.

After an objection is filed, the CRA is required to reassess a tax return &quot;with all due dispatch&quot; according to subsection 165(3) of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;. This may have different meanings depending on how busy the CRA is, the time of year, and other factors. Subsection 165(3) says:On receipt of a notice of objection under this section, the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, reconsider the assessment and vacate, confirm or vary the assessment or reassess, and shall thereupon notify the taxpayer in writing of the Minister&#x27;s action.

===Income tax returns===
Residents of Canada are required to file an individual income tax return every year. Non-residents may have to file a tax return under certain circumstances where they directly earn income in Canada, which can be rental payments, stock dividends, or royalties that a non-resident earns in Canada during a given tax year.

Income is generally reported through the T-series forms, with the number corresponding with a specific type of income situation. Individual taxpayers will report their income using the T1 return. Corporations and trusts respectively use the T2 and T3 forms. Employers use the T4 form to issue a statement of remuneration paid for individual employees, which is then submitted to employees for T1 filing purposes Lastly, any investment income or capital gains earned by a taxpayer is reported in a T5 form. Depending on the complexity of a taxpayer&#x27;s income situation, supplementary forms outside of the T-series may need to be completed.

For income tax purposes, trusts are treated as a taxable entity by the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;. A legal representative of an estate of a deceased person may have to file a T3 return for the estate if it has properties that has not been distributed. Unlike the United States, families cannot file joint returns. A partnership is not a taxable entity for income tax purposes and its income is taxed in the hands of its partners.

Individual taxpayers can file by paper, telephone, or electronically. Taxpayers have two methods for filing electronically: NETFILE, which is for individuals who file their own tax returns, and EFILE, used for professional tax preparers that file on behalf of their clients. Taxpayers that prepare their own taxes through NETFILE generally need to obtain tax filing software from a third-party provider in order to use the system. As of the 2019 tax year, the vast majority of taxpayers file their taxes electronically (90.3%) while increasingly fewer taxpayers (9.7%) use the traditional paper method. Most taxpayers (56.5%) rely on EFILE to submit their return, meaning that most Canadians generally seek out tax professionals when preparing their annual returns.

Many benefits, such as Canada Child Benefit (CCB), are determined by the income reported on the T1 returns. If returns are not filed, taxpayers may not be able to obtain benefits they are entitled to. Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) contribution room also depends on the taxpayer&#x27;s reported income.

Employees normally have income tax withheld on each paycheque by their employers, who remit the tax withheld together with payroll taxes to the CRA. Contractors (and most pensioners) are normally required to pay instalments for income tax to CRA during the year. Once a tax return is filed, a tax refund will be available if the tax withheld or the instalments are more than tax owing calculated on the tax return. If the tax return results in a balance due, it must be paid in full by the due date or interest will accrue daily.

===GST/HST returns===
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), collectively referred to as GST/HST, are governed by the &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;, which requires many entities to register for a GST/HST account and remit GST/HST collected. These entities include sole-proprietors, partnerships, and corporations. Not-for profit organizations, are normally exempt for income tax purposes, but are required to register for GST/HST accounts under the current rules.

GST/HST returns are due monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the volume of sales. If sales are less than $30,000 per year, a business may qualify as smaller suppliers, who are not required to register for GST/HST.

===Payroll tax returns===
An employer is required to withhold income tax and payroll taxes, such as CPP and EI, and to remit the withheld amount to the CRA monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the amount of withholding. By the end of every February, an employer is required to file a T4 return, that is, a T4 summary for total wages paid by the business, and T4 slips for wages paid to each employees, to the CRA.

==Tax collection==
The CRA is responsible for collecting several taxes on behalf of the federal government, and most provincial and territorial governments (except Quebec), including personal income taxes, corporate taxes, sales taxes, fuel charges, and certain excise taxes as defined under the &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;. As a separate agency, the CRA maintains partnerships and agreements with provincial, territorial, and other levels of government to administer non-harmonized sales tax programs on a cost-recovery basis.

===Income tax===
Personal income taxes

The Canada Revenue Agency collects most individual income taxes in Canada. Canada uses tax brackets to determine an individual&#x27;s tax obligations, the rates of which are set by the Department of Finance. Personal income taxes are levied by both the federal government and provincial governments, each with separate rates, but are collected together with the exception of Quebec.

Based on individual earnings, employers will typically deduct income tax, in addition to Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) and Employment Insurance (EI) deductions from an employee&#x27;s paycheque. However, taxpayers that rely on rental or investment income, or are self-employed generally do not have taxes automatically deducted from their pay, must remit tax payments to the CRA either as a lump-sum or in quarterly instalments.

While most taxpayers file only through the CRA, Quebec residents file separately with the CRA and Revenu Québec each year.

==== Corporate income taxes ====
Taxes for provincial corporations in Canada are administered by the CRA, except for provinces of Alberta and Quebec. Ontario previously administered corporate taxes until 2008, after which the CRA took over responsibility collecting these taxes. The provinces maintain dual tax rates, with a lower rate applicable to income that qualifies for the federal small business deduction, and the higher rate to all other forms of income. While some provinces adhere to the business limit for the lower rate set by the federal governments, other provinces choose to maintain their own rate.

===Goods and Services Tax (GST)===
The Canada Revenue Agency collects the Goods and Services Tax (GST) (the Canadian federal value added tax) of 5 per cent in all provinces. In Quebec, under an agreement with the federal government, Revenu Québec administers the GST to businesses, and administers Quebec&#x27;s own Quebec Sales Tax (QST). The Goods and Services Tax was introduced in 1991 at 7 per cent added to the value of most sales of goods and services. The GST was reduced to 6 per cent in 2006 and 5 per cent in 2008, the current rate.

===Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)===
In Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Ontario the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been replaced by the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The Harmonized Sales Tax combines the national GST and the provincial sales tax into a single tax. The HST is administered by the CRA. Each province that has Harmonized Sales Tax receives its portion of the HST from the CRA.

In 2013, British Columbia removed HST after public protests against the newly taxed items under HST that were not taxed under the PST/GST system.

==Benefits and credits administration==

CRA administers social benefits and tax credits on behalf of the federal government and most provinces and territories. Notable benefits and credits at the federal level include the Canada Child Benefit (CCB), which aims to assist families with children, the Climate Action Incentive (CAI), which pays dividends directly to Canadians as part of Canada&#x27;s carbon pricing scheme and the Disability Tax Credit (DTC), which helps eligible recipients with disabilities reduce the amount of income tax they owe.

===Canada Child Benefit===
The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a non-taxable benefit for Canadians with children under 17 to assist them with the cost of living. The amount that a taxpayer receives through the CCB is tied to household income, which could include the income for a taxpayer&#x27;s spouse. As such, taxpayers are required to file their taxes, in order to be assessed for and receive the benefit. The CCB was implemented in July 2016, and builds upon existing benefit programs (UCCB and CCTB) in addition to other child-related credits.

=== COVID-19 emergency benefits ===

The economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary and permanent closure of businesses throughout Canada, leading to the loss of several thousand jobs. This resulted in the creation of several economic measures targeting different sectors of Canadian society, which the CRA was tasked with administering.

The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was introduced as a temporary benefit available to Canadians who stopped working involuntarily due to the pandemic. It provides $2,000 per month successful applicants during the eligible period. Income earned through CERB was taxable and those who applied without being eligible could have face penalties during future tax assessments. Eligible recipients were required to have also earned $5,000 in income during the 2019 tax year, and could not earn more than $1,000 per month when claiming CERB. The benefit was administered jointly by the CRA and Service Canada, with nearly 8.5 million Canadians applying for the benefit. representing nearly 21.5 million unique applications. The program was closed on December 2, 2020.

Similarly, the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) was developed as a parallel benefit for high school graduates, post-secondary students, and recent post-secondary graduates who do not qualify for CERB, with a shorter eligibility period of four months. CESB received about 2.1 million applicants, with over 675,000 unique applicants as of August 2020.

== Compliance ==

===Audits===

The CRA performs audits with their 1700 auditors to ensure that taxpayers are meeting their tax obligations, are compliant with tax legislation, and receive the benefits they are entitled to. Auditors have the right to examine the books and records of a taxpayer, examine the property in an inventory of a taxpayer, enter the taxpayer&#x27;s premises or place of business, require the owner or manager of a property to give all reasonable assistance and to answer questions, and require a taxpayer or other person to provide information or documents. Taxpayers must cooperate with auditors or may face obstruction charges under section 238 of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;.

Income tax audits are done at a Tax Service Office (TSO). Examiners that work in the office audit program restrict their examination to business expenses reviews. They conduct their examination by correspondence and do not visit a business in the field. Auditors working the SME (Small and Medium Enterprises), Basic File, and Large File programs conduct their audits in the field, typically at the taxpayer&#x27;s place of business. The audit conducted by field auditors are not restricted and could cover many and any issues in a tax return.

GST/HST audits are done by TSOs. The Refund Integrity program deals only with a credit return, that is, a GST/HST return that requests a refund. The prepayment examination is a restricted audit of input tax credits (ITCs). Post audit is a full audit of GST/HST returns and that covers not only ITC but also GST/HST collected.

When an auditor feels as though they cannot rely upon the books and records of the taxpayer being audited, they can avail themselves of the net worth methodology. In this method, rather than auditing the actual books and records of the taxpayer, the auditor calculates the difference between the taxpayer&#x27;s net worth (assets less liabilities) at the beginning of the audit period and at the end of the audit period. The auditor then adds to the change in net worth (an increase or decrease), the cost of living for the taxpayer for the period in question. The sum of these two figures will be used by the auditor to determine the taxable income for the taxpayer over the audit period. This figure is in turn compared to the figure reported by the taxpayer. While this methodology is widely used, the CRA Auditor&#x27;s manual indicates that it is a method of last resort, which should only be used in limited circumstances.

===Investigations===
CRA operates four investigation programs: Voluntary Disclosures Program, Informant Leads Program, Special Enforcement Program and Criminal Investigations Program.
* Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP): A program that allows taxpayers to avoid penalty or prosecution if they choose to correct inaccurate or incomplete information, or to disclose information previously withheld to CRA. In order to be accepted into this program, the taxpayer&#x27;s action or omission must involve the application, or potential application of a penalty by CRA and he/she is willing to make a complete disclosure.
* Informant Leads Program (ILP): This program allows for citizens to report individuals or businesses who may be committing tax evasion or other tax-related offences.
* Special Enforcement Program (SEP): As proceeds of crime are taxable, this program specifically conducts audits and undertake other civil enforcement actions on individuals known or suspected of deriving income from illegal activities. Collections Officers are responsible for collecting taxes owed and to seize assets under the&quot; Income Tax Act&quot;. The program was eliminated after the 2012 federal budget cut.
* Criminal Investigations Program (CIP): Investigators from this program are responsible for suspected cases of tax evasion, fraud and other serious violations of tax laws. Criminal Investigators are given badges and can only exercise investigative power in compliance with the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

===CPP/EI rulings===
The CRA is responsible for making CPP/EI rulings, that is, to determine whether any wages or payments are insurable under Canadian Pension Program and/or Employment Insurance program. The substance of a ruling is to determine whether an individual is an employee or a self-employed contractor. An employee can get EI benefits and contractor cannot. Normally, CPP/EI rulings are requested by Service Canada when they try to determine whether EI benefits should be paid out.

===Arbitrary assessments===
If a taxpayer does not file a tax return on time, the CRA may first send a request, like a reminder, to the taxpayer asking them to file the outstanding return. This first letter is called TX11. If the taxpayer still does not file the return, the CRA may send a second letter demanding that the return be filed. This second letter is called TX14. After that, a third letter, TX14D, could be issued, normally by registered mail, or could be delivered personally by a non-filer officer.

If a return is not filed after the computer-generated letters, such as TX11 and TX14, a non-filer officer could arbitrarily prepare a tax return for the taxpayer, normally generating a larger tax bill than what the taxpayer would expect. A notice of assessment under subsection 152(7) of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; will be issued. This 152(7) assessment is commonly known as an arbitrary assessment. Collection actions may follow. The taxpayer could file an amended tax return to reduce the tax bill. Once amended returns are filed, an audit is normally triggered.

If a non-filer officer determines that insufficient info is available for issuing an arbitrary assessment, they may refer the file to Investigations, who would then take the taxpayer to court. The taxpayer may be ordered by court to file the outstanding return, normally being imposed a court fine. If the taxpayer ignore the court order, they will be subject to contempt of court charges.

==Dispute resolution==

===Appeals===

Taxpayers who believe the CRA has not assessed the correct amount of tax may dispute the assessment by filing an objection. There are strict timelines for filing an objection. The objection will be reviewed by the appeals program of CRA. An appeal officer will make a decision independent of audit. The appeal officer could confirm, vary, or vacate an audit. The appeal officer has the discretion to negotiate a settlement, normally under the condition that the taxpayer will not appeal further to the tax court.

If after the objection has been assessed, the taxpayer is still dissatisfied, an appeal may be made to the Tax Court of Canada within the permitted time. The court examines the claim and evidence the taxpayer submits, then looks at the evidence and arguments made by the CRA before passing judgment. The CRA, acting on behalf of the Minister of National Revenue, is represented by a tax litigation lawyer from the Department of Justice Canada. The CRA auditor becomes a witness for the purpose of providing evidence in tax court. Like any other Canadian court, the Tax Court operates by treating each side of a dispute as equals while applying tax law, contract law, constitutional law and the laws of evidence. In addition, the taxpayer is generally not responsible for costs in relation to their opponent, but only for their costs related to their own defence. In the event the appeal is successful, a repayment of legal costs from the CRA may be sought.

Tax court deals with issues that arise from an assessment under the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Tax, 2001, the Underused Housing Tax, the Select Luxury Items Act, and the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, amongst others. It also deals with issues that arise under the Canada Pension Plan and the Employment Insurance Act.

If a tax return has no tax payable, the Tax Court could not deal with it. If the assessment is an assessment of a provincial tax, Tax Court could not deal with it and it has to be resolved in the appropriate provincial court.

Tax Court has two procedures: informal and general. The informal procedure is less onerous and the delay is generally shorter before the case is heard. A taxpayer could represent themselves or get a friend or accountant in the informal procedure. Informal procedures only deal with assessments to certain threshold and a taxpayer has to elect to take this route. Decisions from informal procedures are not precedent-setting and the judge has more discretion than in general procedures. Informal procedures allow limited appeal rights to the Federal Court of Appeal. General procedures deal with all assessments and require a taxpayer either to represent themselves or get a lawyer. The timeline for a general procedure case from the notice of appeal to the decision could take years. The decisions are precedent-setting.

If a taxpayer believes the Tax Court of Canada was wrong in considering the facts or the interpretation of the law, they could appeal the Tax Court decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, or even further to the Supreme Court of Canada.

===Service complaints===

Taxpayers aggrieved by the conduct of the CRA may file a service-related complaint. This complaint must deal strictly with the service provided, not the legal aspect of the service (for example, a service level complaint may be raised for unprofessional language, but not for a request for payment under the law).

The complaint is first passed to the office that is the subject of the complaint. If the taxpayer is not satisfied with the way the first office handles it, they may escalate the complaint to the regional office, which investigates the complaint and contacts the taxpayer. If the taxpayer remains unsatisfied, a complaint may be made to the Taxpayer Ombudsman.

===Remission order===

Remission orders are not commonly known and rarely granted. If a taxpayer agree to a tax assessment but are unable to pay, they could request a remission order to the CRA, which will then make a recommendation to the minister, who will advise the governor-in-council to grant a remission order if the collection of tax is unjust.

== Taxpayer relief ==
Taxpayer relief is governed by subsection 220(3.1) of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; and section 281.1 of the &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;. It gives the CRA the discretion to cancel some penalties and interest, to pay a personal income tax refund after 3 years of the tax return being assessed, and to accept late-filed elections.

The CRA will exercise their discretion when late filing is caused by extraordinary circumstances, such as flood or earthquake, by CRA delay or error, or by financial hardship.

A taxpayer may request relief on a prescribed form or may elect use a letter instead provided the points raised on the form are all covered by the letter. If the request is denied, a taxpayer could request a second review, which will be done by a higher rank official. If the request is still denied, a taxpayer could request a judicial review of the decision in Federal Court (not the Tax Court). The federal court will determine whether CRA exercises its discretion reasonably. If not, the court will send the file back to the CRA for reconsideration. The court rarely will make a decision for CRA because the discretion is with CRA and not the court. If a taxpayer is not happy with the judicial decision, they can pursue an appeal at the Federal Court of Appeal.

== Oversight and accountability ==
===Office of the Taxpayers&#x27; Ombudsperson===

The Office of the Taxpayers&#x27; Ombudsperson is an arm&#x27;s-length office which reports directly to the Minister of National Revenue to improve accountability at the CRA. The Taxpayers&#x27; Ombudsperson is appointed by the Governor-in-Council with a mandate to assist, advise, and inform the Minister of National Revenue about any matter relating to services provided to a taxpayer by the CRA. The Taxpayer&#x27;s Ombudsperson is currently François Boileau, who was appointed October 5 2020.

In fulfilling this mandate, the Ombudsperson reviews complaints from taxpayers that report breaches of their service-related rights by the CRA. The Ombudsperson upholds the eight taxpayer service rights in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights that are directly related to the services delivered by the CRA. To uphold these rights, the Office of the Taxpayers&#x27; Ombudsperson facilitates access to the available redress mechanisms for taxpayers and raises awareness of the role of the office and the Taxpayers&#x27; Ombudsperson.

In addition to individual examinations, the Ombudsperson may, on its own initiative, conduct an examination of systemic service-related issues. The Minister of National Revenue may also request the Ombudsperson conducts an examination.

Examinations are reported to the Minister of National Revenue and made public Each year, the Ombudsperson releases an annual report that is presented to the Minister of National Revenue that is in turn tabled in Parliament.

===Taxpayer Bill of Rights===
In 2007, the Harper government introduced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights and the Commitment to Small Business to help improve the CRA&#x27;s service to Canadians. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights is meant to enshrine the CRA&#x27;s corporate values of professionalism, integrity, respect, and collaboration by setting clear standards for how taxpayers should be treated when interacting with the CRA. These rights include the right to privacy and confidentiality, to expect clear service standards, and to lodge service complaints and request formal reviews without fear of reprisal.

==Criticism and controversies==
=== Call centre operations ===
In 2015, the CBC reported that an internal survey determined that 1 in 4 calls asking for help from the CRA&#x27;s business enquiries call centre received inaccurate information.

=== Financial records to the U.S. government ===
In September 2019, the CRA was criticized for sending nearly 900,000 financial records of Canadian residents to the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. This represents significant growth from 700,000 in 2017 and 150,000 in 2014. 

=== Tax complaints ===
In 2016, the &quot;Financial Post&quot; reported that the auditor general criticized the CRA for taking too long to respond to tax complaints. The delays cost Canadian taxpayers large sums of money in interest on the amounts in dispute.

=== Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) ===
The CRA has been criticised for its handling of CERB. The CRA admitted in December 2020 that &quot;unclear&quot; instructions given to call centre agents relating to CERB led to confusion around eligibility. Since then, it has asked certain recipients to repay their benefit in full.

In 2023 the CRA began investigating its employees who had utilized the CERB benefit while being employed with the agency. On October 16 2024, following an internal investigation it was announced over 330 employees that worked for the CRA no longer work for the agency. An additional 30 employees were subjected to disciplinary measures.

=== Mismanagement of Taxpayer Funds ===
In 2023, the CRA admitted that it had paid out $100 million to scammers engaging in a &quot;carousel scheme&quot;. 

=== Settlement Practices and Controversy ===
In March 2016, it was claimed that the CRA violated its own policy by offering to forego imposing gross negligence penalties or criminal investigation of wealthy clients of KPMG engaged in what the CRA alleged were sham transactions to hide offshore assets if those taxpayers agreed to pay tax and arrears interest without contesting amounts owing. This was considered by some experts as violating standard CRA policy, according to which such misconduct would only be eligible for the waiver of penalties if the taxpayer voluntarily disclosed the misconduct before CRA learned of the practice. The incident sparked internal division. In May 2022, Federal Court filings revealed that the CRA granted tax deals to a major, unnamed corporation based in the United States and Netherlands relating to transfer pricing allocation of international goods and services..

<doc id="518069" wikidata="Q3494005" url="?curid=518069" title="Philip Sheppard (biologist)">
<text>Professor Philip MacDonald Sheppard, F.R.S. (27 July 1921 – 17 October 1976) was a British geneticist and lepidopterist. He made advances in ecological and population genetics in lepidopterans, pulmonate land snails and humans. In medical genetics, he worked with Cyril Clarke on Rh disease.

He was born on 27 July 1921 in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England and attended Marlborough College from 1935 to 1939.

*1940 to 1945 - Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (prisoner-of-war from 1942 to 1945). Participated, as an earth-bearer, in one of the famous tunnel escapes; it is unclear whether this was the &quot;Wooden Horse&quot; escape, or the &quot;Great&quot; Escape
*1946 to 1948 - Studied Zoology at Worcester College, University of Oxford.
*1956 to 1959 - Lecturer at Liverpool University
*1959 to 1962 - Reader at Liverpool University
*1963 to 1976 - Professor of genetics at Liverpool University
*18 March 1965 - FRS
*1974 - Darwin Medal of the Royal Society
*1975 - Linnean Medal (Gold Medal) for Zoology from the Linnean Society of London

Cyril Clarke answered an advert in an insect magazine for swallowtail butterfly pupa that had been placed by Sheppard. They met and began working together in their common interest of lepidopterology. They also worked on Rh disease.

In 1961 Sheppard started a colony of scarlet tiger moths by the Wirral Way, West Kirby, Merseyside, which were rediscovered in 1988 by Cyril Clarke, who continued to observe them in his retirement to study changes in the moth population.

Sheppard married Patricia Beatrice Lee in 1948. They had three sons. He died of acute leukemia on 17 October 1976.

<text>Aggborough Stadium is a football stadium in Kidderminster, England. It is the home ground of Kidderminster Harriers, and has a capacity of 7,000, of which 3,140 can be seated. The ground was also the home of Worcester City between 2013 and 2016.

==History==
The ground was opened in May 1890 with a single grandstand on the western touchline, and initially included a banked running track. In 1935 a new 460-seat grandstand was built, and by World War II covered areas had been created on the east and southern sides of the ground.

After the war the running track was replaced by a cycle track. On 27 November 1948, the ground&#x27;s record attendance of 9,155 was set for an FA Cup first round replay against Hereford United. On 14 September 1955 Aggborough Stadium became the first ground to host a floodlit FA Cup match, when Harriers faced Brierley Hill Alliance in a preliminary round replay, with Kidderminster winning 4–2.

A new East Stand was built in 1979, and terracing was created all around the pitch in 1983. The ground was rebuilt in the 1990s, with the cycle track removed and a new Main Stand built in 1994. Covered terracing was added at each end of the pitch. When Kidderminster won their first Conference title in 1994, Aggborough Stadium was not deemed to meet Football League standards and as a result Kidderminster were denied promotion to Division Three. By the time Kidderminster won their second Conference title six years later, the ground had been upgraded to Football League standards and promotion was allowed. In 2003, the new 2,040-seat cantilever stand was built to replace the old East Stand.

On 30 January 2013, it was announced that Worcester would ground-share with Kidderminster Harriers at their Aggborough ground from the 2013–14 season.

Worcester City decided to terminate their arrangement with Kidderminster and move to Bromsgrove and groundshare the Victoria Ground with Bromsgrove Sporting F.C. from the start of the 2016–17 season.

<doc id="518073" wikidata="Q345531" url="?curid=518073" title="W. Averell Harriman">
<text>William Averell Harriman (November 15, 1891July 26, 1986) was an American politician, businessman, and diplomat. He was a founder of investment bank, Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., served as Secretary of Commerce under President Harry S. Truman, and was the 48th governor of New York. He sought the Democratic Party nomination for president in 1952 and 1956 but was unsuccessful. Throughout his career, he was a key foreign policy advisor to Democratic presidents.

Harriman was born to a wealthy family as the son of railroad baron E. H. Harriman. While attending Groton School and Yale University, he made contacts that led to creation of a banking firm that eventually merged into Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. He owned parts of various other companies, including Union Pacific Railroad, Merchant Shipping Corporation, and Polaroid Corporation. During the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriman served in the National Recovery Administration and on the Business Advisory Council before moving into foreign policy roles. After helping to coordinate the Lend-Lease program, Harriman served as Roosevelt&#x27;s personal envoy to the United Kingdom, then as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and attended the major World War II conferences. After the war, he became a prominent advocate of George F. Kennan&#x27;s policy of containment. He also served as Secretary of Commerce, and coordinated the implementation of the Marshall Plan.

In 1954, Harriman defeated Republican Senator Irving Ives to become the Governor of New York. He served a single term before his defeat by Nelson Rockefeller in the 1958 election. Harriman unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention and the 1956 Democratic National Convention. Although Harriman had Truman&#x27;s backing at the 1956 convention, the Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson II in both elections.

After his gubernatorial defeat, Harriman became a widely respected foreign policy elder within the Democratic Party. He helped negotiate the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty during President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s administration, and was deeply involved in the Vietnam War during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. After Johnson left office in 1969, Harriman became affiliated with various organizations, including the Club of Rome and the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Early life and education==
William Averell Harriman was born in New York City, the son of railroad baron Edward Henry Harriman and Mary Williamson Averell. He was the brother of E. Roland Harriman and Mary Harriman Rumsey. Harriman was a close friend of Hall Roosevelt, the brother of Eleanor Roosevelt.

During the summer of 1899, Harriman&#x27;s father organized the Harriman Alaska Expedition, a philanthropic-scientific survey of coastal Alaska and Russia that attracted 25 of the leading scientific, naturalist, and artist luminaries of the day, including John Muir, John Burroughs, George Bird Grinnell, C. Hart Merriam, Grove Karl Gilbert, and Edward Curtis, along with 100 family members and staff, aboard the steamship &quot;George Elder&quot;. Young Harriman would have his first introduction to Russia, a nation on which he would spend much attention in his later life in public service.

He attended Groton School in Massachusetts before going on to Yale, where he joined the Skull and Bones society and Psi Upsilon. He graduated in 1913. After graduating, he inherited one of the largest fortunes in America - his father had died in 1909 - and became Yale&#x27;s youngest Crew coach.

==Career==
===Business affairs===
Using money from his father, he established the W.A. Harriman &amp; Co banking business in 1922. His brother Roland joined the business in 1927 and the name was changed to Harriman Brothers &amp; Company. In 1931 it merged with Brown Bros. &amp; Co. to create the highly successful Wall Street firm Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. Notable employees included George Herbert Walker and his son-in-law Prescott Bush.

Harriman&#x27;s main properties included Brown Brothers &amp; Harriman &amp; Co, the Union Pacific Railroad, the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, and venture capital investments that included the Polaroid Corporation. Harriman&#x27;s associated properties included the Southern Pacific Railroad (including the Central Pacific Railroad), the Illinois Central Railroad, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the Pacific Mail Steamship Co., American Ship &amp; Commerce, Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Aktiengesellschaft (HAPAG), the American Hawaiian Steamship Co., United American Lines, the Guaranty Trust Company, and the Union Banking Corporation.

He served as Chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council for the United States Department of Commerce, in 1937 and 1939.

=== Politics ===
Harriman&#x27;s older sister, Mary Rumsey, encouraged Averell to leave his finance job and work with her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA National Recovery Administration, a federal effort to revitalize the American economy via price controls, marking the beginning of his political career.

===Thoroughbred racing===
Following the death of August Belmont Jr., in 1924, Harriman, George Walker, and Joseph E. Widener purchased much of Belmont&#x27;s thoroughbred breeding stock. Harriman raced under the nom de course of Arden Farm. Among his horses, Chance Play won the 1927 Jockey Club Gold Cup. He also raced in partnership with Walker under the name Log Cabin Stable before buying him out. U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Louis Feustel, trainer of Man o&#x27; War, trained the Log Cabin horses until 1926. Of the partnership&#x27;s successful runners purchased from the August Belmont estate, Ladkin is best remembered for defeating the European star Epinard in the International Special.

===War seizures controversy===
Harriman&#x27;s banking business was the main Wall Street connection for German companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of Fritz Thyssen, who was a financial backer of the Nazi Party until 1938. The Trading With the Enemy Act (enacted on October 6, 1917) classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to a U.S. government order on October 20, 1942, to seize German interests in the U.S., which included Harriman&#x27;s operations in New York City.

The Harriman business interests seized under the act in October and November 1942 included:
* Union Banking Corporation (UBC) (from Thyssen and Brown Brothers Harriman)
* Holland-American Trading Corporation (from Harriman)
* Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation (from Harriman)
* Silesian-American Corporation (this company was partially owned by a German entity; during the war, the Germans tried to take full control of Silesian-American. In response to that, the American government seized German-owned minority shares in the company, leaving the U.S. partners to carry on the portion of the business in the United States.)

The assets were held by the government for the duration of the war, then returned afterward; UBC was dissolved in 1951.

Compensation for wartime losses in Poland was based on prewar assets. Harriman, who owned vast coal reserves in Poland, was handsomely compensated for them through an agreement between the American and Polish governments. Poles who had owned little but their homes received negligible sums.

===World War II diplomacy===

==== Beaverbrook-Harriman mission ====

Beginning in the spring of 1941, Harriman served President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a special envoy to Europe and helped coordinate the Lend-Lease program. Roosevelt, in appointing him, referred to Harriman as his &quot;defense expediter.&quot;

Harriman arrived in London in March 1941, and was quickly absorbed into the close circle of counselors and intimates cultivated by the British prime Minister Winston Churchill. Less than a week later, he was dining with the prime minister at 10 Downing Street when a major bombardment by the Luftwaffe began, and he joined Churchill on the roof to watch the bombs fall. As part of his official duties, Harriman was expected to supply Roosevelt with regular reports on Churchill&#x27;s actions and character. Harriman believed that the U.S. would inevitably be drawn into the conflict, in spite of the isolationist sentiment at home.

Less than a month after his arrival in London, during another bomber raid, Harriman began a romantic affair with Pamela Digby Churchill, who was married to Churchill&#x27;s son Randolph. but their marriage was in tatters - a result of his steady drinking problems, and his gambling addiction. Pamela was 21 years old and Harriman was 50.

In August 1941, Harriman was present at the Atlantic Conference meeting between FDR and Winston Churchill in Placentia Bay, which yielded the Atlantic Charter. The joint agreement would establish American and British goals for the period following the end of World War II—before the U.S. was involved in that war—in the form of a common declaration of principles that were eventually endorsed by all of the Allies. Harriman was subsequently dispatched to Moscow to negotiate the terms of the Lend-Lease agreement with the Soviet Union in September 1941, together with the Canadian publishing millionaire Lord Beaverbrook, who represented the United Kingdom. Harriman tended to follow Beaverbrook&#x27;s argument that since Germany had committed three million men to the invasion of the Soviet Union—so that the Soviets were doing the bulk of the fighting against the Third Reich—it was in the best interests of the Western powers to do everything to assist the Soviet Union. The decision to aid the Soviet Union was taken against the advice of the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, Laurence Steinhardt, who from the moment that Operation Barbarossa started on June 22, 1941, had been sending cables predicting the Soviet Union would be rapidly defeated, and that any American aid would thus be wasted. Likewise, General George Marshall was advising President Roosevelt that it was inevitable that Germany would crush the Soviet Union, and predicted that the Wehrmacht would reach Lake Baikal by the end of 1941.

The most important result of the Beaverbrook-Harriman mission to Moscow was the conclusion agreed upon between Churchill and Roosevelt that the Soviet Union would not collapse by the end of 1941. Additional conditions of the agreement were that even if the Soviet Union was defeated in 1942, keeping Soviet Russia fighting would impose major losses on the Wehrmacht, which would only benefit the United States and the United Kingdom. Harriman has been subsequently criticized for not imposing preconditions on American aid to the Soviet Union, but the American historian, Gerhard Weinberg, has defended him on this point, arguing that in 1941, it was Germany—not the Soviet Union—that represented the main danger to the United States. Furthermore, Joseph Stalin told Harriman that he would refuse American aid if preconditions were attached, leaving Harriman with no alternatives on the issue. Harriman believed if Germany defeated the Soviet Union, then all of the vast natural resources of the Soviet Union would be at the disposal of the &quot;Reich&quot;, making Germany far more powerful than it already was. Therefore, it was in the best interests of the United States to deny those resources to the &quot;Reich&quot;. He also pointed out that the defeat of the Soviet Union would free up three million men of the Wehrmacht for operations elsewhere, allowing Hitler to shift money and resources from his army to his navy and potentially increasing the threat to the United States. Harriman told Roosevelt that if Operation Barbarossa was successful in 1941, Hitler would almost certainly defeat Britain in 1942. His promise of $1 billion in aid technically exceeded his brief. Determined to win over the doubtful American public, he used his own funds to purchase time on CBS radio to explain the program in terms of enlightened self-interest. Nonetheless, considerable U.S. public skepticism towards Soviet aid persisted, lifting only with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

In a speech in 1972, Harriman stated: &quot;Today people tend to forget that, in 1941, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill had one prime objective: to destroy Hitler&#x27;s forces, and win the war in a way that would be least costly in terms of human lives. For over a year, the British alone had borne the brunt of Nazi attacks; for their own self-preservation, they wanted to keep Russia as a fighting ally. Roosevelt had yet another consideration in mind. In those early days of the war, he was fearful that we would eventually be drawn into the conflict, yet he still hoped that our participation could be limited to air and naval forces, with a minimum of ground troops. We are all, to a considerable extent, the product of our experience: Roosevelt had a particular horror of the trench warfare of World War I and he wanted above all to prevent that fate from again befalling American fighting men. He hoped that, with our support, the Red Army would be able to keep the Axis forces engaged. The strength of the British divisions coupled with our own air and sea power might then make it unnecessary for the United States to commit major ground forces on the European continent&quot;. The Beaverbrook-Harriman mission promised that the United States and Great Britain would supply the Soviet Union every month with 500 tanks and 400 airplanes, plus tin, copper, and zinc. However, the promised supplies had to be sent via the perilous &quot;Murmansk run&quot; through the Arctic Ocean, and only a tiny fraction of what was promised had in fact arrived by December 1941.

On November 25, 1941 (twelve days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), Harriman noted that &quot;The United States Navy is shooting the Germans—German submarines and aircraft at sea.&quot; In 1941, a team of officers, led by General Albert Wedemeyer on behalf of General Marshall, drew up the Victory Program, whose premise was that the Soviet Union would be defeated that year, and that to defeat Germany would require the United States to raise by the summer of 1943 a force of 215 divisions comprising 8.7 million men. The Harriman-Beaverbrook mission, whose more optimistic appraisal of Soviet fighting power ran contrary to the more pessimistic assessment, challenged one of the basic assumptions of the Victory Program. The Victory Program, with its call for a 215-division army plus men for the Army Air Corps, the Navy and the Marines that would require massive amounts of equipment, leading to what was known as the Feasibility Dispute within different departments of the government. To build the necessary weapons for such a massive force would require the government essentially to end all civilian production in the U.S., a measure estimated to cause a 60% reduction in living standards. Many in the government felt this would impose a level of sacrifice that the American people would be unwilling to accept. The Feasibility Dispute ended in 1942 with the &quot;civilian&quot; fraction triumphing over the military as Roosevelt decided upon what was known as the &quot;90 division gamble&quot;. Roosevelt decided that all of the evidence he received since the Harriman-Beaverbrook mission indicated that the Soviet Union would not be defeated as the Victory Program had assumed, and accordingly the 215 division force envisioned was not necessary and instead he would &quot;gamble&quot; with a 90 division force.

==== Moscow Conference ====
In August 1942, Harriman accompanied Churchill to the Moscow Conference to explain to Stalin why the western allies were carrying out operations in North Africa instead of opening the promised second front in France. The meeting was a difficult one with Stalin openly accusing Churchill to his face of lying to him and suggested that the British would not open a second front in Europe because of cowardice, sarcastically saying that the recent defeats suffered by the British 8th Army in North Africa showed how brave the British were against the Wehrmacht. Harriman had spent much time after the meeting at the Kremlin reminding Churchill that the Allies needed the Soviet Union and to try not to take Stalin&#x27;s remarks too personally, saying the fate of the world was hanging in balance. On June 24, 1943, Harriman met with Churchill to tell him that Roosevelt did not want him to attend the up-coming summit meeting with Stalin, saying that it was important to allow Roosevelt who had never met Stalin to establish an &quot;intimate understanding&quot;, which would be &quot;impossible&quot; if Churchill was there. Churchill rejected this suggestion, sending a telegram to Roosevelt full of hurt feelings saying: &quot;I do not underrate the use that enemy propaganda would make of a meeting between the heads of Soviet Russia and the United States at this juncture with the British Commonwealth and Empire excluded. It would be serious and vexatious, and many would be bewildered and alarmed thereby&quot;. Roosevelt in his reply lied by saying that this was just a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and he had never wanted to exclude Churchill from the summit with Stalin.

==== Four Power declaration ====
Harriman was appointed as United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union in October 1943. In his 1975 memoir &quot;Special Envoy to Churchill and Stalin, 1941-1946&quot;, Harriman wrote that Stalin was &quot;the most inscrutable and contradictory character I have ever known&quot;, a mysterious man of &quot;high intelligence and fantastic grasp of detail&quot; who possessed much &quot;shrewdness&quot; and &quot;surprising human sensitivity&quot;. Harriman concluded that Stalin was &quot;better informed than Roosevelt, more realistic than Churchill, in some ways the most effective of the war leaders. At the same time he was, of course, a murderous tyrant&quot;. Harriman, who thoroughly enjoyed living in London, did not want to be U.S. ambassador in Moscow and only reluctantly accepted the assignment in October 1943 after Roosevelt told him that he was the only man he wanted in Moscow. Harriman was also reluctant to part with his mistress, Pamela Churchill, the wife of Randolph Churchill. Although Harriman was one of the richest men in the United States, running a vast business empire comprising investments in railroads, aviation, banks, utilities, shipbuilding, oil production, steel manufacturing, and resorts, this in fact endeared him to the Soviets who believed he represented American capitalist ruling class. Nikita Khrushchev later told Harriman: &quot;We like to do business with you, for you are the master and not the lackey&quot;. Stalin viewed the United States through a Marxist prism, which saw American Big Business as the puppeteers and American politicians as the puppets.

At a three power conference in Moscow that took place between October 19 and 30, 1943, Harriman played a major role in representing the United States as part of the American delegation headed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull while the Soviet delegation was headed by the Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov and the British delegation headed by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The main American demands at the Moscow Conference were to have a new international organization replace the League of Nations to be called the United Nations; to have Soviet Union to agree to adhere to the &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; formula adopted at the Casablanca conference (a major point given that the Soviets sometimes hinted that they were willing to sign a separate peace with Germany); and for the &quot;Big Three&quot; powers whom it was assumed would dominate the post-war world to be a &quot;Big Four&quot; as the Americans wanted China to stand alongside the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain as one of the world&#x27;s dominant powers. The demand for a &quot;Big Four&quot; instead of a &quot;Big Three&quot; turned out to the main difficulty at the Moscow conference as the British and Soviets did not consider China a major power in any sense. As long as the Soviet Union was engaged in the war against Germany, they did not wish to antagonize Japan with whom they had signed a neutrality agreement in 1941, and the Soviets objected that having Foo Ping Shen, the Chinese ambassador to Moscow, sign the proposed Four Power Declaration would cause tensions with Tokyo. Eventually, after much patient diplomacy, Harriman won out, and a Four Power declaration was signed on October 30, 1943, by Hull, Eden, Molotov and Foo stating that the four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council would be the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China.

==== Planning for Operation Overlord and the war&#x27;s end ====
Besides for the Four Power declaration, the other issues at the Moscow conference were whether the United States would recognize the French Committee of National Liberation headed by General Charles de Gaulle as the French government-in-exile. Roosevelt had a strong personal aversion to de Gaulle, and throughout the war, the Americans had an &quot;anybody but de Gaulle&quot; attitude. At Moscow, the Americans very reluctantly agreed to Eden&#x27;s insistence that they extend some recognition to de Gaulle, although the Americans still refused to grant him full recognition, a matter which contributed much to de Gaulle&#x27;s subsequent anti-Americanism. The question of who the legitimate government of France was posed a major potential problem since the next year Operation Overlord, the invasion of France, was scheduled to take place. Presuming Overlord was successful, the question would arise over whom the Anglo-Americans would turn France over to. Nothing infuriated de Gaulle more than the implication that the Americans would not hand over France to his National Committee after the liberation. Tensions between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the Arctic supply convoys were eased while the difficulties over supplies coming over Iran were left unresolved despite Harriman&#x27;s best efforts at playing mediator. On the matter of Germany, the Soviet Union agreed to the &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; formula while it agreed that after the war, Germany was to be disarmed and denazified.

All of the delegations at the Moscow conference agreed that Germany was to be permanently disarmed after the war, which led to the question of whether Germany should be deindustrialized as well in order to ensure that Germany would never be able to build military weapons again; no consensus was reached over this issue. The question of what Germany&#x27;s borders were to be after the war was left unresolved, through everybody at the conference agreed that Germany was going to lose territory with the only question being just how much. One matter where agreement was reached was with Austria as it was announced at the Moscow conference that the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of 1938 was to be undone and Austria would have its independence restored after the war. Finally, in regards to the &quot;Reich&quot;, it was agreed that war crimes trials were to take place after the war with lesser war criminals to be tried in the nations where they had committed their crimes while the leaders of Germany were to be tried by a special court consisting of judges from the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. The communique in Moscow which announced that war crimes trials would be held after the war was intended primarily as a deterrent to German officials currently engaged in war crimes as it was hoped that the prospect of facing a hangman&#x27;s noose after the war might change their behavior. As for Italy, it was agreed that the Soviet Union was to send a representative to the Allied Control Commission which governed the liberated parts of Italy and that Italy was to pay reparations to the Soviet Union in the form of ships, as much of the Italian merchant marine was to be handed over to the Soviet Union. No agreement was reached over the question of the Soviet Union&#x27;s borders after the war, with the Soviets insisting that their postwar borders should be exactly where they were on June 21, 1941, a point that the American delegation and to a lesser extent British delegation resisted.

==== Relations with Poland and China ====
At the Tehran Conference in late 1943 Harriman was tasked with placating a suspicious Churchill while Roosevelt attempted to gain the confidence of Stalin. The conference highlighted the divisions between the United States and Britain about the postwar world. Churchill was intent on maintaining Britain&#x27;s empire and carving the postwar world into spheres of influence while the United States upheld the principles of self-determination as laid out in the Atlantic Charter. Harriman mistrusted the Soviet leader&#x27;s motives and intentions and opposed the spheres approach as it would give Stalin a free hand in eastern Europe. At the Tehran conference, Molotov finally promised Harriman what he long sought, namely that after Germany was defeated, the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan. At Tehran, Roosevelt told Stalin that as a &quot;practical man&quot; who was planning to run for a fourth term in 1944 that he had to think of Polish-American voters, but that he agreed that the Soviets could keep the part of Poland they had annexed in 1939, provided that this was kept a secret until the 1944 election. Harriman felt that this was a mistake, as he regarded Roosevelt&#x27;s statement that the Polish government had to accept the loss of some of its territory as virtually agreeing to allow the Soviets to impose any government they wanted on Poland because it was unlikely that the Polish government-in-exile would agree with the annexation. At the same time, Harriman was jolted when Molotov admitted to him that there had been attempts at arranging a separate German-Soviet peace which would leave the Western Allies to face the full force of the Wehrmacht earlier in 1943, but that the Soviets had rejected the peace overtures. The way in which Molotov phrased his account implied to Harriman that in the future the Soviets might be more receptive to such peace offers, which Harriman regarded as an attempt at blackmail. On January 22, 1944, Harriman&#x27;s daughter Kathleen, whom the British Foreign Office described as &quot;the poor man&#x27;s Mrs. Roosevelt&quot;, traveled to Katyn Forest to see the &quot;evidence&quot; that the Soviet authorities had produced meant to prove that the Katyn Forest massacre had been committed by the Germans in 1941, instead of the Soviets in 1940. Since all of the available evidence suggested that the Soviets had in fact committed the Katyn Forest massacre in April 1940, Harriman later stated that he tried to avoid the subject, telling a Senate hearing &quot;No, I do not recall the subject came up&quot;.

Starting in February 1944, Harriman pressed Stalin to open U.S-Soviet staff talks to prepare for when the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan, only to be told this was &quot;premature&quot; as Stalin stated it would require at least four infantry divisions to invade Manchuria, which would not be possible given that the Soviets were fully involved in the war against Germany. For the rest of 1944, Harriman pressed Molotov to bring the head of the Soviet Far Eastern Air Force to Moscow to open staff talks with the U.S. military mission about establishing American air bases in either the Vladivostok area or in Kamchatka to allow American aircraft to bomb Japan. Molotov refused to make any firm commitments about allowing American bombers to strike Japan from air bases in the Soviet Union. Another major concern of the Roosevelt administration was to ensure that the Chinese civil war did not resume with the end of World War II, and to do so, the Americans sought a coalition government between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. In connection with this, Harriman met Stalin on June 10, 1944, to get from him a rather generalized statement declaring his support for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as China&#x27;s only leader and a promise that he would use his influence with Mao Zedong to pressure him to recognize Chiang. In August 1944, Harriman sought permission for American aircraft flying supplies to the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; rebels fighting in the Warsaw Uprising to land at the Poltava airbase as otherwise the American aircraft would have no fuel to make it home. On August 16, 1944, the Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Andrei Vyshinsky, told Harriman that &quot;the Soviet government cannot of course object to English or American aircraft dropping arms in the region of Warsaw since this is an American or British affair. But they decidedly object to American or British aircraft, after dropping arms in the region of Warsaw, landing on Soviet territory, since the Soviet government does not wish to associate themselves either directly or indirectly with the adventure in Warsaw&quot;. In a cable to Washington, Harriman wrote: &quot;The Soviet Government&#x27;s refusal is not based on operational difficulties nor on a denial of the conflict, but on ruthless political calculations&quot;.

==== Negotiations preceding the bombing of Japan ====
In the summer of 1944, Stalin promised Harriman that the Americans would be allowed to use air bases in the Soviet Far East to bomb Japan, but only if the Americans supplied the Soviet Air Force with hundreds of four engine bombers. In September 1944, Stalin expressed much pique to Harriman that the recent Anglo-American communique issued at the Quebec Conference did not mention the Soviet Union, leading him to sarcastically state &quot;if the United States and Great Britain desired to bring the Japanese to their knees without Russian participation, the Russians were ready to do this&quot;. When Harriman protested it was impossible to include the Soviet Union in the plans for victory over Japan until the Soviets opened staff talks, Stalin assented.

On 15 October 1944, Harriman accompanied a British delegation to Moscow to discuss Soviet entry into the war with Japan, see Pacific Route. In early October 1944, the commanders of military forces in the Soviet Far East arrived in Moscow to begin staff talks with General John Deanne of the U.S. military mission. At the same time, Stalin informed Harriman that Soviet entry into the war against Japan would require American approval of certain political conditions about the future of Manchuria, a point about which he did not elaborate upon. On December 14, 1944, Stalin spelled out to Harriman what these political conditions were, namely that the Soviet Union be allowed to lease the Chinese Eastern Railroad and the ports on the Liaotung peninsula and for China to recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia. In a thinly veiled threat, Stalin boasted to Harriman that the flat open plains of Manchuria and northern China were the perfect country for Soviet combined arms operations, expressing much confidence that the Red Army would have no difficulty defeating the Kwantung Army and that all of northern China would be under Soviet control once the Soviets declared war on Japan. Essentially, Stalin was saying the Soviets would take whatever they wanted in China, regardless if they had an agreement with the United States or not. At a dinner at the Kremlin during the visit of General de Gaulle to Moscow in December 1944, Harriman was disturbed by the way Stalin toasted Chief Air Marshal Alexander Novikov in front of him and de Gaulle, saying: &quot;He has created a wonderful air force. But if he doesn&#x27;t do his job properly then we&#x27;ll kill him&quot;.

==== Yalta Conference ====
Harriman also attended the Yalta Conference, where he encouraged taking a stronger line with the Soviet Union—especially on questions of Poland. The American delegation at the Yalta conference stayed at the luxurious Livadia Palace overlooking the Black Sea, and Harriman was given a room of his own to stay, a sign of presidential favor as most of the American delegation had to sleep five men to a room owing to a surplus of delegates and a lack of space in the Livadia Palace. The Livadia palace had been built in 1910–11 as a summer residence for the Emperor Nicholas II and his family, and was designed to house only 61 people, hence the presence of a 215-strong American delegation literally overwhelmed its facilities.

On February 8, 1945, Roosevelt, Harriman and Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Bohlen who served as the interpreter met Stalin, Molotov and the translator Vladimir Pavlov to discuss the Soviet entry into the war against Japan. During the meeting, it was agreed that the Kuriles islands and the southern half of Sakhalin island were to be annexed by the Soviets. Without consulting Chiang, Roosevelt agreed to the Soviet demands for a role in managing the port of Dairen and to own the Chinese Eastern Railroad, through with the regard to the former he felt that Dairen should be internationalized. Roosevelt stated that he could not inform the Chinese at present because whatever was said to them &quot;was known to the whole world in twenty-four hours&quot;, but he would tell them when the time was right; much to Harriman&#x27;s mirth, Stalin promised he could &quot;guarantee the security of the Supreme Soviet!&quot; Once Molotov presented a draft note to Harriman about the future of Manchuria, Harriman complained that the Soviet draft stated the Soviet Union would lease both Dairen and Port Arthur and manage not only the Chinese Eastern Railroad, but the South Manchuria Railroad as well. Harriman objected, stating that Roosevelt wanted the ports on the Liaotung peninsula to be internationalized, not leased by the Soviet Union and for the Manchurian railroads to be run jointly by a Sino-Soviet commission instead of being owned by the Soviet Union. Molotov agreed to Harriman&#x27;s amendments, but when Churchill expressed his approval of Stalin&#x27;s request for the Soviets to have a naval base at Port Arthur, the latter told Harriman that internationalization would not be possible for Port Arthur. The final draft called for the internationalization of Dairen with a leading role reserved for the Soviet Union; the Soviets to have a naval base at Port Arthur; a Sino-Soviet commission to run the railroads of Manchuria; and China to recognize Outer Mongolia.

On February 10, 1944, Harriman informed Stalin that Roosevelt had agreed to the British call for the &quot;Big Four&quot; to become the &quot;Big Five&quot; by including France. Specifically, the Americans were backing the British call to recognize France as one of the great powers of the post-war world and to allow the French to have an occupation zone in Germany. Through Stalin had been opposed to de Gaulle&#x27;s claims for the French to have an occupation zone in Germany, the Anglo-American front on this issue, which was relatively unimportant to him, led him to tell Harriman that he now agreed on a four-power occupation of Germany. On February 11, 1945, the conference ended and the following day Harriman saw Roosevelt, his friend since childhood, for the last time, as he boarded a C-54 airplane at Saki airfield to take him to Egypt. On April 12, 1945, Roosevelt died.

==== Deterioration of Soviet-American relationship after the war ====
At the Yalta conference, it was agreed that American prisoners captured by the Germans and liberated by the Soviets were to be immediately repatriated to American forces. The fact that the Soviets made many difficulties about fulfilling this promise such as not allowing American officers into Poland to contact American prisoners of war there led to frequent clashes between Harriman and Molotov, and contributed much to Harriman&#x27;s increasing negative feelings about the Soviet Union. On May 11, 1945, Harriman reported in a cable to Washington that Stalin &quot;feared a separate peace by ourselves with Japan&quot; before the Soviet Union had moved its forces eastwards to take invade Manchuria. After Roosevelt&#x27;s death, he attended the final &quot;Big Three&quot; conference at Potsdam. Although the new president, Harry Truman, was receptive to Harriman&#x27;s anti-Soviet hard line advice, the new secretary of state, James Byrnes, managed to sideline him. While in Berlin, he noted the tight security imposed by Soviet military authorities and the beginnings of a program of reparations by which the Soviets were stripping out German industry.

In 1945, while Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman was presented with a Trojan Horse gift. In 1952, the gift, a carved wood Great Seal of the United States, which had adorned &quot;the ambassador&#x27;s Moscow residential office&quot; in Spaso House, was found to be bugged.

===Statesman of foreign and domestic affairs===

Harriman served as ambassador to the Soviet Union until January 1946. When he returned to the United States, he worked hard to get George Kennan&#x27;s Long Telegram into wide distribution. Kennan&#x27;s analysis, which generally accorded with Harriman&#x27;s, became the cornerstone of Truman&#x27;s Cold War strategy of containment.

From April to October 1946, he was ambassador to Britain, but he was soon appointed to become United States Secretary of Commerce under President Harry S. Truman to replace Henry A. Wallace, a critic of Truman&#x27;s foreign policies. In 1948, he was put in charge of the Marshall Plan. In Paris, he became friendly with the CIA agent Irving Brown, who organised anti-communist unions and organisations. Harriman was then sent to Tehran in July 1951 to mediate between Iran and Britain in the wake of the Iranian nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

In 1949, the Defense Secretary James Forrestal committed suicide and afterwards Harriman and his wife Marie virtually adopted Forrestal&#x27;s son Michael. Harriman paid tuition for Michael Forrestal when he attended Harvard Law School and made him make connections with New York&#x27;s elite when he went into work at a law firm. Michael Forrestal served as a protege of Harriman&#x27;s and later followed him into the Kennedy administration.  

In the 1954 race to succeed Republican Thomas E. Dewey as Governor of New York, the Democratic Harriman defeated Dewey&#x27;s protege, U.S. Senator Irving M. Ives, by a tiny margin. He served as governor for one term until Republican Nelson Rockefeller unseated him in 1958. As governor, he increased personal taxes by 11% but his tenure was dominated by his presidential ambitions. Harriman was a candidate for the Democratic Presidential Nomination in 1952, and again in 1956 when he was endorsed by Truman but lost (both times) to Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson.

Despite the failure of his presidential ambitions, Harriman became a widely respected elder statesman of the party. Harriman&#x27;s long friend Truman believed that the United States, which was a Protestant majority country, would never elect a Catholic president, which led him to oppose Senator John F. Kennedy in the 1960 Democratic primaries. Under Truman&#x27;s influence, Harriman had been slow to endorse Kennedy, only doing so after it became clear that Kennedy was going to win the Democratic nomination. After Kennedy won the 1960 election, Harriman pressed hard for a position in the new Kennedy administration, which Kennedy younger brother and right-hand man Robert Kennedy opposed, saying that Harriman was too old and a latecomer to the Kennedy camp. However, after a luncheon, where Harriman recalled his service with Roosevelt and Truman, the elder Kennedy decided that Harriman&#x27;s knowledge and experience might serve his administration well. Kennedy did make a condition: he told Harriman&#x27;s adopted son, Michael Forrestal: &quot;Averell&#x27;s hearing is atrocious. If we&#x27;re going to give him a job, he has to have a hearing aid, and I want you to see that he does&quot;.

In January 1961, he was appointed Ambassador at Large in the Kennedy administration, a position he held until November, when he became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. In 1961, at the suggestion of Ambassador Charles W. Yost Harriman represented President Kennedy at the funeral of King Mohammed V of Morocco. During this period he advocated U.S. support of a neutral government in Laos and helped to negotiate the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963.

During a visit to New Delhi to meet the Indian prime minister Nehru, Harriman met an exiled Lao Prince Souvanna Phouma, who favored neutrality for his nation in the Cold War. At the time, there was a civil war in Laos between the Communist Pathet Lao and the anti-Communist Special Forces, and Harriman concluded based on his talks in New Delhi that the best outcome would be neutrality for Laos and that Souvanna Phouma was not a Communist dupe as the CIA claimed. Shortly after his return to the United States, the Pathet Lao won a victory on the Plain of Jars on March 9, 1961, and all of Laos seemed to be brink of taken over by the Pathet Lao. Kennedy seriously considered American intervention in Laos, but he soon learned that Laos was logistically difficult for the American forces to reach and more importantly to be supplied once they had arrived. Furthermore, Laos bordered China and Kennedy was informed that if the United States sent troops to fight in Laos, so too would the Chinese sent troops to Laos to fight them.

As Kennedy pondered what to do about Laos, Khrushchev in Moscow told the American ambassador, Llewellyn Thompson, that he was wanted to see an international conference to settle the Lao civil war, an offer Kennedy promptly accepted. Harriman was visiting Turkey with the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, when he suddenly received a call from Kennedy telling him to go to Laos at once for an assessment of the situation. Harriman relished his job as a diplomatic trouble-shooter who was accustomed to working on his own and embraced the assignment, through he complained that he was not dressed for the tropics as he rushed off to Laos. On his way to Vientiane, he stopped in Saigon to meet the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Lemnitzer, who agreed with Harriman&#x27;s plans to send troops to Laos to improve the American bargaining position. However, on April 24, 1961, the Pathet Lao unilaterally declared a ceasefire, and Harriman headed to Geneva to head the American delegation to discuss the neutralization of Laos.

Rusk headed the American delegation at the Geneva conference, but after a week he returned to Washington and left Harriman in charge. Harriman felt at 126 strong that the American delegation was too large, and believed that too much time would be wasted in meetings. Harriman appointed William Sullivan as his deputy and ordered him to reduce the size of the delegation. When Sullivan suggested cutting the delegation by a third, Harriman shouted &quot;That&#x27;s not enough. I want it cut by half&quot;. When Rusk objected that Sullivan as a Class 3 officer was not senior enough to serve as Harriman&#x27;s deputy, the latter replied: &quot;Nobody will know, nobody will care, what his rank is&quot;. When the Chinese foreign minister Chen Yi indicated a willingness to meet privately with Harriman, Rusk refused, saying the Republicans would attack the Democrat Kennedy as &quot;soft on Communism&quot; if it emerged that an American diplomat had a met Chinese diplomat. An infuriated Harriman responded that in World War II Roosevelt had let him meet anyone whom it was necessary for him to meet, and charged that Rusk was too rigid to serve as secretary of state.

The Chinese delegation accused the United States of supporting Phoumi, leading Harriman to accuse the Chinese of supporting the Pathet Lao. A Soviet diplomat named Georgi Pushkin told Harriman privately the next day: &quot;You did the Chinese a great injustice&quot;. When Harriman inquired how, Pushkin replied: &quot;They&#x27;re not helping the Pathet Lao. All the arms and ammunition are coming from us&quot;. With that remark, Harriman came to understand that the Soviets wanted Laos to be neutral out of the fear that a Communist Laos would be in the Chinese sphere of influence, an insight that did much to improve his bargaining power.

Harriman, who at this stage still thought that Southeast Asia was relatively unimportant for the United States, endorsed a call by Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles to make all of Southeast Asia neutral. This plan Rusk stoutly opposed. In November 1961, Kennedy promoted Harriman to the role of assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs. William Sullivan replaced Harriman as the head of the American delegation in Geneva.

Harriman favored the neutralist Prince Souvanna Phouma as the next leader of Laos and urged Kennedy to drop American support for right-wing Prince Phoumi Nosavan. In a memo in 1962 to Carl Rowan of the U.S. Information Agency entitled &quot;Burn this!&quot;, Harriman stated his views about how Kennedy&#x27;s administration was responding to journalistic coverage of Indochina, saying that the media would treat a greater role by U.S. advisers as &quot;our participation in this war - a new war under President Kennedy - the Democratic War Party, so skillfully avoided by the Republican President Eisenhower. The press do not belong in these aircraft, but can be kept fully informed by briefings in Saigon by our military or embassy&quot;. During a visit to Vientiane, Harriman pressed Phoumi Nosavan to accept Souvanna Phouma as prime minister and a lesser cabinet post in his a government headed by him. Harriman was in notably cranky mood and Michael Forrestal, who translated Harriman&#x27;s remarks into French for Lao leaders, found himself substituting less offensive words for some of Harriman&#x27;s ruder words. Harriman&#x27;s original remark to Phoumi Nosavan that he was stupidly self-destructive was one of his kinder statements.

Shortly afterwards, on May 6, 1962, Phoumi Nosavan led his men into a notable defeat at Nam Tha. Phoumi Nosavan claimed to have been defeated by a North Vietnamese division, but an American general, Reuben Tucker, reported to Kennedy that there were no North Vietnamese at Nam Tha and that Phoumi &quot;couldn&#x27;t lead a squad around a corner&quot;. General Tucker&#x27;s reports confirmed to Kennedy Harriman&#x27;s assessment of Phoumi as a weak leader. Harriman together with Roger Hilsman called for a show of force to prove that the United States was unwilling to accept a Communist Laos after Phoumi&#x27;s defeat. Kennedy decide to move the 7th Fleet into the Gulf of Siam to signal the possibility of American intervention in Laos, which Harriman decided was too mild a statement and urged Kennedy not to move the fleet, least it be seen as a weakness by the Communists. On June 11, 1962, Prince Souvanna Phouma announced the formation of a coalition government to end the civil war in Laos and declared that henceforward his nation would be neutral in the Cold War. Harriman predicted to Kennedy too that the North Vietnamese would keep using the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos, but would accept Souvanna&#x27;s government.

In July 1962 while visiting Geneva, a Burmese diplomat offered Harriman a chance to a meet a North Vietnamese cabinet minister, Ung Van Khiem. Harriman knew that Rusk would not grant permission, so he instead phoned Kennedy and obtained his permission. At the meeting with Khiem, Harriman began by remembering Roosevelt&#x27;s support for Vietnamese independence, saying that if Roosevelt had not died in 1945, America would have pressured the French to grant independence to Vietnam after the war. Khiem replied that he had warm memories of American aid to the Viet Minh in World War II, and said he was surprised that the United States had supported France in an attempt to take back its lost colony after 1945. Khiem accused the United States of acting in bad faith by encouraging President Diem of South Vietnam to cancel the elections that were supposed to unify Vietnam in 1956, and of showing further bad faith by supporting the Saigon regime in its war against the Viet Cong guerrillas. Harriman told Khiem that North Vietnam should stop supporting the Viet Cong and then Vietnam would have peace.

Khiem was very disillusioned by the fact that Harriman believed North Vietnam and South Vietnam to be different countries with little in common. Khiem&#x27;s translator thought that he was missing an opportunity, as Harriman seemed to hint if the Laos accords were respected, then Kennedy might change his policies towards South Vietnam. The meeting ended inconclusively with Harriman saying that North Vietnam should cease its support for the Viet Cong while Khiem stated that the partition of Vietnam was unnatural and that his government was the real Vietnam.

In the Cuban Missile crisis, Harriman urged firmness in pressing for the removal of the Soviet missiles from Cuba. Nevertheless, he also advised Kennedy to give Khrushchev a dignified way to back down.

The Laos settlement, together with Harriman&#x27;s counsel in the Cuban Missile Crisis, greatly raised his prestige with Kennedy. Knowing that he had the president&#x27;s approval, Harriman took to such churlish antics such as turning off his hearing aid whenever a speaker at a National Security Council meetings started to bore him. At one meeting, Harriman cursed the &quot;goddamned generals&quot; who wanted to fight a war first in Laos, and now in South Vietnam, and then, turning to General Earle Wheeler who was sitting opposite him, said &quot;Oh, excuse me, Wheeler&quot; without any embarrassment. The National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy called Harriman &quot;the crocodile&quot; because he was usually quiet before bursting into fury. Harriman became rather enthusiastic about the appellation, and therefore had his desk decorated with miniature silver, bass and crystal crocodiles.

Harriman&#x27;s image was that of a crusty and autocratic elder statesman whose brusqueness and bad temper were legendary in Washington, but whose counsel was greatly valued by Kennedy who appreciated him for his sound judgement on international affairs. When Michael Forrestal joined the National Security Council, Kennedy half-jokingly told him: &quot;You will be my emissary to that special sovereignty, Averell Harriman&quot;. In February 1963, when the embassy in Saigon blamed the negative reporting on South Vietnam&#x27;s government on biased journalists, Harriman advised Frederick Nolting, the American ambassador in Saigon, to stop treating journalists like his enemies.

=== Accusation of spying for the Soviet Union ===
In December 1961, Anatoliy Golitsyn defected from the Soviet Union and accused Harriman of being a Soviet spy, but his claims were dismissed by the CIA and Harriman remained in his position until April 1963, when he became Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He retained that position during the transition to the Johnson administration until March 1965 when he again became Ambassador at Large. He held that position for the remainder of Johnson&#x27;s presidency. Harriman headed the U.S. delegation to the preliminary peace talks in Paris between the United States and North Vietnam (1968–69).

=== Vietnamese coup d&#x27;état ===
President-elect Kennedy appointed Harriman as ambassador-at-large, to operate &quot;with the full confidence of the president and an intimate knowledge of all aspects of United States policy. By the summer of 1963, South Vietnam was in crisis with massive demonstrations being orchestrated by the Buddhist clergy against the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem. In August 1963, the Central Intelligence Agency reported to Kennedy that there were at least three different plots being organized within the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) against Diem. On August 21, 1963, the South Vietnamese Special Forces, which were not part of the ARVN, raided Buddhist pagodas all over South Vietnam, most notably the Xa Loi pagoda in Saigon, the most sacred pagoda in South Vietnam. The raids and the killing of Buddhist monks had raised the temperature in South Vietnam to boiling point. Several ARVN generals complained to the CIA that the press release saying the raids were the work of the ARVN was false, and charged that Diem was not an effective leader, saying that Diem&#x27;s younger brother and right-hand man Ngô Đình Nhu together with his abrasive wife Madame Nhu were in control. Roger Hilsman, the assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern Affairs, had become convinced that the Diem regime was a liability and the United States needed a new government in Saigon to win the war. Harriman supported Hilsman.

On August 24, 1963, on a weekend when Kennedy, Rusk and the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara were all out of Washington, Hilsman with the support of Harriman and Forrestal sent out two cables. The first cable was a press release that announced the raids on the Buddhist pagodas were the work of the Special Forces, not the ARVN. The second cable instructed Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the American ambassador in Saigon, to support a coup if Diem did not exile his younger brother and his sister-in-law whom both Hilsman and Harriman thought were the source of the crisis. Lodge asked for a change in wording, to say his instructions authorize him to tell the rebellious ARVN generals &quot;we are prepared to have Diem without the Nhus, but it is in effect up to them whether to keep them&quot;. The undersecretary of state, George Ball, consulted with Forrestal and agreed to the change, which in effect authorized a coup. The National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy felt he had delegated too much to Forrestal who seemed to him to be more closer to Harriman than to himself.

On August 25, 1963, several members of the cabinet such as Rusk and McNamara who were against a coup were accusing Hilsman and Harriman of attempting to do an end-run around them by sending out a cable supporting a coup when they were not present in Washington. At a meeting called by Kennedy that day to discuss the dispute, the president stated that they had not crossed the Rubicon and it would still possible to change the policy. Harriman argued that before the pagoda raids, it was impossible to know the true state of South Vietnamese public opinion, but the massive demonstrations with millions protesting in the streets showed the Diem regime was deeply unpopular. Kennedy seemed indecisive as McNamara together with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell Taylor, spoke for retaining Diem while Hisman and Harriman argued that the Ngo brothers could not be separated, and to get rid of Nhu, whom Kennedy conceded was a trouble-maker, would also mean getting rid of his older brother. Kennedy agreed to another meeting that same day. Before the meeting, Harriman asked about the mood of the National Security Council, and if it was possible that Kennedy might change his mind. Harriman did not attend the second meeting, which weakened the case for a coup. Still uncertain about what to do, Kennedy opened a third meeting the next day. Before the meeting, Forrestal told him that he was concerned about the claim that he acted unethically in changing the instructions, leading Harriman to say &quot;quit being a goddamned fool&quot;. At the third meeting, Harriman made a vigorous case for a coup and insulted nearly everyone who was opposed to the coup. Harriman told Taylor to his face that he had been wrong on every issue since World War II and was also wrong on this issue. When the Marine General Victor &quot;Brute&quot; Krulak spoke against a coup, Harriman mocked him for his short stature and his nickname of &quot;Brute&quot;. When the former ambassador to South Vietnam, Frederick Nolting, spoke of Diem as a friend and an honorable man, Harriman snapped &quot;No one cares what you think&quot;. Finally, Harriman&#x27;s rudeness got to such a point that Kennedy asked him to please be civil to others in the room or leave. The meeting ended with Kennedy seemingly come around to supporting a coup as Harriman argued that if South Vietnam would be lost to Communism if the Ngo brothers stayed.

Seeking support to change Kennedy&#x27;s mind, Taylor cabled General Paul D. Harkins, the commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, to tell him to advise Kennedy that Diem was the only effective leader South Vietnam had. At the next meeting on August 27, Taylor read out Harkin&#x27;s cable and stated that Harkins had only agreed to support a coup because he thought it was policy in Washington. The cable seemed to have some effect on Kennedy as Taylor maintained that Harkins and the other American advisers were all for Diem as the only leader capable of defeating the Viet Cong. Harriman, who was more polite at this meeting, told Kennedy: &quot;Mr. President, I was very puzzled by the cable from General Harkins until I read the outgoing from General Taylor&quot;. Once it was pointed out that Taylor had asked Harkins to back him up by offering an assessment that supported his views, Kennedy smiled and said afterwards: &quot;Averell Harriman is one sharp cookie&quot;.

The American author Joseph Trento has accused Harriman of being responsible for the coup. In an interview with Trento, Colonel William Corson, USMC, by 1963 has alleged that Harriman was running &quot;Vietnam without consulting the president or the attorney general.&quot; Corson said Kenny O&#x27;Donnell, JFK&#x27;s appointments secretary, was convinced that the National Security Advisor, McGeorge Bundy, followed the orders of Harriman rather than the president. Corson also claimed that O&#x27;Donnell was particularly concerned about Michael Forrestal, a young White House staffer who handled liaison on Vietnam with Harriman.

Harriman certainly supported the coup against the South Vietnam president Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963. However, it is alleged that the orders that ended in the deaths of Diem and his brother actually originated with Harriman and were carried out by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.&#x27;s military assistant. Special Operations Army officer, John Michael Dunn, was sent to Vietnam in his stead. He followed the orders of Harriman and Forrestal rather than the CIA. According to Corson, Dunn&#x27;s role in the incident has never been made public but he was assigned to Ambassador Lodge for &quot;special operations&quot; with the authority to act without hindrance; and he was known to have access to the coup plotters. Corson speculated that with Richardson recalled the way was clear for Dunn to freely act.

===Ambassador-at-Large===

When Johnson ordered &quot;working groups&quot; set up to advise on Vietnam in the fall of 1964, Harriman was one of the &quot;doves&quot;, though a quiet one. In 1965, Harriman visited Moscow to press the Soviet Union to end its support of North Vietnam, meeting the Premier Alexei Kosygin. The meeting went badly with Kosygin asking: &quot;Speaking in human terms, between ourselves, really believe there was a real legal government in South Vietnam. You just cannot believe this. Yet the United States for this so-called government, sheds the blood of its own soldiers and kills defenseless Vietnamese&quot;. Harriman accused North Vietnam of being the aggressor, leading Kosygin to say the South Vietnamese would fight with bamboo sticks against their government. Harriman took the criticism of his country personally and launched a lengthy denunciation of North Vietnam. Kosygin merely laughed and said: &quot;You don&#x27;t believe what you are saying&quot;. Harriman replied that the honor of the United States was at stake, he had the word of President Johnson that the United States would fight on until victory, and asked Kosygin to start negotiating peace. Kosygin, in turn, stated that he did not the legal authority to negotiate on behalf of North Vietnam, and mocked Harriman for saying the United States was helping the ordinary people of South Vietnam, saying: &quot;This is a monstrous statement. You are killing South Vietnamese. History will never forgive the United States for this crime. This will always be a blot on the United States&quot;. Perhaps realizing that the discussion was going nowhere, Kosygin changed the subject by saying that American policies in Vietnam were alienating Asians all over the world and seemingly proving Mao Zedong&#x27;s claim that another world war was inevitable. Harriman insisted on going back to the subject of Soviet support for North Vietnam, Kosygin snapped in fury saying that the regime in Saigon was so corrupt that the Soviet Union could buy their allegiance tomorrow if it wanted, and accused the United States of supporting a hopelessly corrupt government. Kosygin stated that he knew Ho Chi Minh, whom he called an honorable man, and told Harriman that if the Americans wanted peace, then should open talks with North Vietnam.
Reflecting an earlier simmering feud, Harriman was appalled when Johnson&#x27;s newly appointed National Security Adviser, W.W. Rostow, told him that he did not expect the bombing of North Vietnam to continue to such point that it finally caused a nuclear showdown between the Soviet Union and the United States, saying that only from extreme situations do lasting settlements emerge. In February 1967, Harriman was involved in peace negotiations in London involving his deputy Chester Cooper, the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and a visiting Kosygin who hinted that he was carrying a peace offer from Hanoi. Kosygin asked for a 48-hour-long bombing pause as a sign of good faith in the negotiations, which Rostow persuaded Johnson to reject. Harriman had Cooper draft a letter to Johnson protesting the failure of Operation Sunflower. Upon reading Cooper&#x27;s letter with its threats of resignation, Harriman told him: &quot;I can&#x27;t send this. It would be all right for you to send. You&#x27;re expendable&quot;. Cooper was so offended that he did not speak to Harriman for the next days, finally leading the famously cantankerous Harriman to send a letter of apology together with a bottle of Calon Segur wine. In June 1967, Harriman became involved in another attempt at peace code-named Operation Pennsylvania. A professor of political science at Harvard, Henry Kissinger, was attending an academic conference in Paris when he met a French biologist, Herbert Marcovitch, who mentioned that of his friends was the French Communist resistance hero, Raymond Aubrac. Aubrac in turn was one of the few Westerners who was friends with Ho Chi Minh, who generally disliked meeting Westerners. Seeing a chance to work as an (amateur) diplomat who instead of just writing about diplomacy, Kissinger contacted Harriman to ask if Marovitch and Aubrac could go to Hanoi to open up a back channel with Ho, saying Aubrac was one Westerner who Ho would definitely talk to if he visited Hanoi. Permission was granted through Kissinger was told that he was not to claim to be acting officially and the two Frenchmen met with Ho in Hanoi. Upon returning, Aubrac and Marcovitch told Kissinger that Ho was prepared to soften his demand slightly, saying if the United States was willing to stop bombing North Vietnam, he would open peace talks, dropping his previous demand that the United States publicly vow to unconditionally halt the bombing. Harriman sent Cooper to the Paris talks, but just at the same moment, Rostow persuaded Johnson to step up the bombing of North Vietnam. When Aubrac asked if the United States could temporarily stop the bombing as a sign of good faith, Johnson under Rostow&#x27;s influence refused, which marked the end of Operation Pennsylvania.

Despite the way that Harriman had given lavish and very expensive presents to both of the Johnson daughters at their weddings in an attempt to ingratiate with the president, Johnson distrusted Harriman, seeing him as a Kennedy man. However, Harriman had been a close adviser to Johnson&#x27;s hero, Roosevelt, and Johnson wanted the advice of a man who once counselled Roosevelt in World War II. In July 1967, Harriman was silent at a meeting when Johnson considered the advice of his Defense Secretary Robert McNamara to stop bombing North Vietnam, apparently wanting to be within the presidential inner circle again, which kept him from speaking his mind. At the crucial meeting of the &quot;Wise Men&quot; group in March 1968 as Johnson considered escalating the war, Harriman ignored Johnson&#x27;s orders not to attend as he instead arrived in the dining room and ordered a steward to set up a table. Through Harriman did not speak at the meeting, his presence was his way of telling Johnson that if needed a negotiator to talk with the North Vietnamese, he was available. Just before Johnson went on national television on March 31, 1968, to announce he was withdrawing from the election and wanted to open peace talks, Rusk called Harriman to say that he was Johnson&#x27;s preferred lead negotiator if the talks began. Johnson in his speech called Harriman &quot;one of our most distinguished Americans&quot; and asked him to lead the peace talks. Harriman immediately accepted Johnson&#x27;s offer, and promptly began to press Johnson to stop bombing all of North Vietnam in place of the 90% that he had announced in his speech. Much to Harriman&#x27;s intense vexation, it took over a month to find an acceptable venue to hold the peace talks as Geneva, Phnom Penh, Vientiane, and Warsaw were all rejected. Harriman wanted the talks to be held in Warsaw, but Rostow persuaded Johnson to reject that city. Not entirely trusting Harriman, Johnson made Cyrus Vance his deputy.

===Peace-making, Paris 1968–69===
On May 3, 1968, the North Vietnamese suggested taking up the offer of French president Charles de Gaulle to have Paris as the negotiating site, an offer that Johnson accepted. Harriman, who found Rusk overtly bureaucratic and cautious, complained bitterly that in World War II, Roosevelt had allowed him to do practically anything he liked when representing the United States. Rusk told Harriman that when he arrived in Paris he was to read out a statement drafted by him and do no more, leading Harriman to speak fondly of Roosevelt who told him to explain American policies to Churchill and Stalin with &quot;no further guidance&quot;. In a sign of his opposition to the peace talks, Rusk refused to allow Harriman to fly to Paris on a State Department plane, telling since he was a billionaire that he could afford his own flight. The Defense Secretary, Clark Clifford, thought it was undignified for the American delegation to be arriving in Paris on commercial planes, and arranged for Harriman and the rest of the delegation to fly on a Defense Department plane. On May 13, 1968, the first session of the Paris peace talks that would go on until 1973 opened. As the peace talks moved slowly, Johnson seriously considered the advice of Rostow and Rusk to start bombing North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel. Alarmed, Harriman sent Vance to Washington on May 28 to tell Johnson that the Vietnamese would break off the talks if the Americans bombed north of the 20th parallel.

Once in Paris, Harriman quickly learned that the nominal head of the North Vietnamese delegation, Xuan Thuy, had no power, and the real leader of the North Vietnamese delegation was Lê Đức Thọ, a member of the Politburo. Tho had spent almost his entire youth in French prisons and was known as &quot;the Hammer&quot; on the account of his severity. Rather than talk to Xuan at the Majestic Hotel, Harriman wanted to meet Tho in private at various &quot;safe houses&quot; rented by the CIA in the suburbs of Paris. Meeting Tho proved to be difficult as Harriman and Vance had to prove that they were not carrying handguns with the intention of assassinating him. It was not until June 26, 1968, that Vance was finally able to meet the elusive Tho in a house in the suburb of Sceaux. During the meeting, Vance noticed that undercover French spies were observing them dressed as repairmen pretending to fix a fire hydrant. The next day, an irate Harriman called the French foreign minister, Maurice Couve de Murville, to tell him: &quot;You get those damned goons away&quot;. Harriman warned that if French intelligence continued to shadow him and the rest of the American delegation, he would call a press conference to say it was impossible to negotiate in Paris owing to the activities of French spies and he would go home. In July 1968, Harriman reported to Johnson that a lull in fighting indicated the North Vietnamese were serious about negotiating peace, but Rusk in a press conference stated that he believed the lull proved the North Vietnamese were negotiating in bad faith and he believed that the North Vietnamese were about to launch another offensive. In private, Harriman accused Rusk of undermining him. In August 1968, Kissinger contacted Harriman, writing him a note saying he was disgusted with the Republican Party for nominating Richard Nixon as their candidate. Kissinger wrote: &quot;My dear Averell...I am through with Republican politics. The party is hopeless and unfit to govern&quot;. In September 1968, Kissinger went to Paris to serve as a consultant for the American delegation, and unknown to Harriman began to leak information about the peace talks to the Nixon campaign.

In early September, Harriman suggested that he meet Tho himself. On September 8, 1968, Harriman finally met Tho in a villa in the town of Vitry-sur-Seine. Philip Habib of the American delegation read out a statement saying &quot;serious talks&quot; must include both the South Vietnamese and the National Liberation Front, the latter an important concession as previously the Americans had refused to talk to the Viet Cong. Tho read out a speech that lasted an hour, listing all of the wrongs he believed the Americans had inflicted on Vietnam, which caused Harriman to bristle in fury. Xuan suggested a break, leading Harriman to say: &quot;I have had many things stuffed in my head&quot;. After the break, Tho continued his lecture, talking about low morale in the U.S. Army, claimed that the war was the most expensive war in American history, and spoke about the anti-war movement, saying that the American people were not behind Harriman&#x27;s government. At the next meeting on September 12, Tho joked &quot;Last time, Mr. Harriman said he had been stuffed with many things. Today, I&#x27;ll continue to do so&quot;, leading Harriman to say &quot;We are a patient people&quot;. Tho then made a concession, saying that South Vietnam could continue as a state, provided the Viet Cong were allowed to join a coalition government, and said that Hanoi wanted diplomatic relations with Washington. Tho ended by saying that if offer was rejected: &quot;you will step up the war in South Vietnam and resume the bombing of the North, but anyway you will fail&quot;. Harriman thanked Tho for his &quot;straight talk&quot;, but also said that Johnson would want certain concessions before stopping the bombing. Harriman, who was still angry about Tho&#x27;s statements at the last meeting, said that Vietnam was not the most expensive war in American history. Harriman stated that the Vietnam war was consuming 3.5% of American gross national product compared to the 14% in the Korean War and 50% in World War II. About Tho&#x27;s predictions of failure, Harriman said: &quot;You&#x27;ve lost 140, 000 men from Tet to this day without succeeding in seizing any city, any U.S. military base. The so-called General Uprising has also failed&quot;. Harriman offered to withdraw all American forces from South Vietnam provided that North Vietnam did the same, and promised billions in economic aid to repair the damage done by American bombers to North Vietnam.

On October 11, 1968, at the CIA safehouse in Sceaux, a crucial meeting occurred over the champagne and caviar Harriman had purchased. Tho told Harriman he was willing to accept the key American demand that the South Vietnamese government join the peace talks in exchange for the United States ceasing to bomb the 10% of North Vietnam that was still being bombed. Tho later recalled that Harriman looked relieved when he made the offer to accept South Vietnam to join the peace talks. Despite the caviar, which Harriman claimed was a gift from Kosygin, the North Vietnamese much preferred the Parisian ice cream and cookies he purchased. On October 12, Kissinger contacted Richard Allen, Nixon&#x27;s foreign policy adviser, to tell him that Harriman &quot;had broken open the champagne&quot;, saying there was a real possibility of a peace deal being reached before the election, which could potentially swing the election towards the Democratic candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey. On October 15, 1968, at the next meeting, Harriman noticed that Tho was absent, leading him to guess: &quot;Perhaps Mr. Tho is going to meet Mr. Kosygin, isn&#x27;t he?&quot; At the meeting, Harriman told Xuan if South Vietnam was included &quot;we can tell that the order to stop all bombardments will be given within the next day or two&quot;. However, Harriman added the condition that the four party talks involving the United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front had to begin the next day. The South Vietnamese president Nguyễn Văn Thiệu began to pose objections to the peace talks, saying his government represented the people of South Vietnam and would not take part if the National Liberation Front were included. Unknown to Harriman, Thiệu was being encouraged to be obstructionist by the Nixon campaign.

At a meeting of October 26, Harriman met with Xuan who suggested a bombing halt for October 30 and the four-party conference to begin on November 6 or 7. Harriman wanted the four-party talks to begin already two or three days after the bombing would have stopped, but Xuan wanted a longer interval to prove to the North Vietnamese people that it had indeed ended. Xuan said if the American stopped bombing tomorrow (October 27), the four-party talks could begin on November 2, five days after the bombing ceased. Harriman objected, saying &quot;No, it&#x27;s six days, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;. Xuan asked him &quot;Did you count the second of November?&quot;, leading Harriman to say &quot;Five days. Each day twenty-four hours. Thank you, this is very important&quot;. Harriman sent Johnson a telegram suggesting the Americans accept the North Vietnamese terms. In Washington, Johnson decided to accept Harriman&#x27;s advice, but Thiệu refused to take part in the negotiations, ostensibly because he objected to the Viet Cong taking part, but in reality because he was hoping that Nixon would win the election.

Thiệu&#x27;s obstructionism ensured the four-party talks did not being until January 1969 as the various delegations disputed over the type of table they would meet at, with the North Vietnamese wanting a square table while the Americans and South Vietnamese wanted a rectangle. On January 14, 1969, Harriman met with Tho, saying as of January 20 he was to be replaced with Nixon&#x27;s nominee, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Tho expressed regret at Harriman leaving Paris, saying: &quot;If you had stopped bombing after two or three months of talks, the situation would have been different now&quot;. On January 17, Harriman gave North Vietnamese delegates a gift of matches as a farewell gift while Xuan gave Harriman a copy of &quot;Vietnamese Studies&quot;. Tho thought that Harriman seemed very melancholic as he desperately wanted to clinch a peace deal to end the Vietnam War, an honor that he now knew would be denied to him.

=== Later years ===
On October 15, 1969, Harriman was a featured speaker at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam protest march in New York. In his speech, Harriman denounced the Vietnam War as immoral and stated that President Richard Nixon &quot;is going to have to pay attention.&quot;

Harriman received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction, in 1969 and West Point&#x27;s Sylvanus Thayer Award in 1975. Furthermore, in 1983 he received the Freedom Medal.

In 1973 he was interviewed in the now famous TV documentary series, &quot;The World at War&quot;, where he gives a recollection of his experiences as Roosevelt&#x27;s personal representative in Britain along with his views on Cold War politics; in particular Poland and the Warsaw Pact; along with the exchanges he witnessed between Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin. In one such recollection he describes Stalin as &quot;utterly cruel&quot;.

Harriman was appointed senior member of the US Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s Special Session on Disarmament in 1978. He was also a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy Charter, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Knights of Pythias, Skull and Bones society, Psi Upsilon fraternity, and the Jupiter Island club.

==Personal life==

Harriman&#x27;s 1915 first marriage, two years after graduating from Yale, was to Kitty Lanier Lawrence. The daughter of Francis C. Lawrance Jr., Kitty was the great-granddaughter of James Lanier, a co-founder of Winslow, Lanier &amp; Co., and the granddaughter of Charles D. Lanier (1837–1926), a close friend of J.P. Morgan Before their divorce in 1929, and her death in 1936, Harriman and Lawrence had two daughters together:
* Mary Averell Harriman (January 1917 – 1996), who married Shirley C. Fisk
* Kathleen Lanier Harriman (December 1917 – 2011), who married Stanley Grafton Mortimer Jr. (1913–1999), who had previously been married to socialite Babe Paley (1915–1978)

About a year after his divorce from Lawrence, Harriman married Marie Norton Whitney (1903–1970), who had left her husband, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, to marry him. On their honeymoon in Europe, they purchased oil paintings by Van Gogh, Degas, Cézanne, Picasso, and Renoir. She and her husband later donated many of the works she bought and collected, including those of the artist Walt Kuhn, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. They remained married until her death on September 26, 1970, at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. With Marie, Harriman helped raise the future bandleader Peter Duchin, the orphaned son of bandleader Eddy Duchin and socialite Marjorie Oelrichs.

In 1971, Harriman reconnected with his former lover, Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (1920–1997), at a dinner party at the home of Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. Pamela was by this time the widow of Broadway producer Leland Hayward.

Harriman and Pamela married in New York City eight weeks later, and remained married until his death.

Harriman died on July 26, 1986, in Yorktown Heights, New York, at the age of 94. In 1993, Pamela became the 58th United States Ambassador to France.

Averell and Pamela Harriman are buried at the Arden Farm Graveyard in Arden, New York.

===Legacy and honors===
*The Harriman Hall at Stony Brook University was named in his honor.
*The W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus in Albany, New York, also carries his name.
*Harriman State Park (Idaho)
For the state park in New York named after his parents, see Harriman State Park (New York).
Harriman State Park is a state park in eastern Idaho, United States. It is located on an wildlife refuge in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and is home to an abundance of elk, moose, sandhill cranes, trumpeter swans, and the occasional black or grizzly bear. Two-thirds of the trumpeter swans that winter in the contiguous United States spend the season in Harriman State Park. The land was deeded to Idaho for free in 1977 by Roland and W. Averell Harriman, whose insistence that the state have a professional park managing service helped prompt the creation of the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation in 1965. The park opened to the public in 1982. It is located in Fremont County, 3 miles (4.8 km) south of Island Park, Idaho. Henry&#x27;s Fork, a fly-fishing stream, winds through the meadows of Harriman State Park. In winter, many of its roads and trails are groomed for cross country skiing.

<text>Bad Homburg vor der Höhe () is the district town of the Hochtaunuskreis, Hesse, Germany, on the southern slope of the Taunus mountains. Bad Homburg is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. The town&#x27;s official name is &quot;Bad Homburg v.d.Höhe&quot;, which distinguishes it from other places named Homburg.

The town has become best known for its mineral springs and spa (hence the prefix &quot;Bad&quot;, meaning &quot;bath&quot;), and for its casino.

, the town used the marketing slogan &quot;Champagnerluft und Tradition&quot; (Champagne air and tradition).

, Bad Homburg was one of the wealthiest towns in Germany (while the Hochtaunuskreis itself and the Landkreis Starnberg in Bavaria regularly vie for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany).

==History==

===Medieval origins===
Local tradition holds that Bad Homburg&#x27;s documented history began with the mention of the &quot;Villa Tidenheim&quot; in the Lorsch codex, associated with the year 782. This &quot;Villa Tidenheim&quot; was equated with the historic city center, which is called Dietigheim. The local historian Rüdiger Kurth has questioned this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. In 2002, Kurth initiated archaeological excavations by the University of Frankfurt, managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed no evidence of settlement between the beginning of the Christian Era and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record in the Eberbach chronicles (&quot;Eberbacher Zeugenreihe&quot;) which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg&#x27;s founder about 1180 is the first solid evidence of the town&#x27;s existence.



As early as 1962, in an excavation under the Hirschgang wing of Bad Homburg Castle, two burnt layers were discovered, which the archaeologist Günther Binding interpreted as evidence of two former castles having occupied the site in succession and burnt down.

Further digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg Castle in April 2006, again initiated by Kurth and managed by Prof. Henning, revealed only a single burnt layer, from a half-timbered building, possibly a castle with towers, which was dated from ceramic finds to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin&#x27;s &quot;castle&quot;. A further cultural layer from an even earlier time may lie beneath these remains. Investigations using carbon-14 dating and analysis will show whether the dating can be made more precise.

Homberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.

The town&#x27;s name, &quot;Homburg&quot;, is derived from the &quot;Hohenberg&quot; Castle. The suffix &quot;vor der Höhe&quot; was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation &quot;Bad&quot; was conferred in 1912.

The first landgrave of Hessen-Homburg was Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680–1708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. In 1866, as a result of the Austro-Prussian War, Homburg became Prussian territory.

===Spa town and imperial residence===
With the beginning of the spa industry in the town in the mid-19th century, Homburg became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility.

The spa industry began with the discovery of the &quot;Elisabethenbrunnen&quot; (&quot;Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s spring&quot;) in 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built in 1841–1842 by the brothers François (1806–1877) and Louis Blanc (1806–1852), who later owned the Monte Carlo Casino. In 1860, the town was connected with Frankfurt by a railway line.

In 1888, Homburg became known throughout the German Empire because Kaiser Wilhelm II made its castle his imperial summer residence. He later financed the building of the Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche) nearby. The emperor&#x27;s mother also lived there for several years. Edward VII of the United Kingdom was often a guest; it was he who introduced the Homburg hat and turned-up trousers. Edward took fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.

The Bad Homburger Golf Club in the &quot;Röderweisen&quot; in Dornholzhausen – now part of Bad Homburg – is Germany&#x27;s oldest golf club. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg spa park, where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old golf course can still be found.

Not far away stands the Russian Chapel, properly called All Saints&#x27; Church, an Eastern Orthodox church whose cornerstone was laid by the Russian imperial couple on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend the church&#x27;s consecration almost three years later.

King Chulalongkorn of Siam (Thailand) sent a garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected in 1914.

Horex was a well known German motorcycle brand of the &quot;Horex—Fahrzeugbau AG&quot;, founded in 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.

===Jewish history===

In 1335, permission was given by Emperor Louis IV to Gottfried von Eppstein to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of Eppstein, Homburg, and Steinheim; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first Jewish cemetery was purchased in the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that in 1703 the landgrave Frederick II of Hesse decided on the construction of a special Judengasse (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built in 1731, was replaced by a new one in 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of Friedberg but began to appoint its own rabbis in the 19th century.

A Hebrew printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis from 1710 until 1713, when he relocated to Offenbach am Main. Among other items, he published Jacob ibn Ḥabib&#x27;s &quot;Ein Ya&#x27;akov&quot; (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there in 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired in 1736 by Aaron ben Ẓevi Dessau whose publications included the &quot;Shulhan Arukh (Ḥoshen Mishpat)&quot; with commentary (1742). The press was sold in 1748 and transferred in 1749 to Roedelheim. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of Russian-Jewish intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) in 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 in 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported in 1942/1943 to Concentration Camps, never to return.

===Modern age===
While the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of bizonal authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the &quot;Special Money and Credit Centre&quot; here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by Ludwig Erhard. After the Federal Republic of Germany—- West Germany—- was founded with its capital in Bonn, the Federal Debt Administration (&quot;Bundesschuldenverwaltung&quot;), the Office for Security Adjustment (&quot;Amt für Wertpapierbereinigung&quot;) and the Federal Equalization Office (&quot;Bundesausgleichsamt&quot;) stayed in Bad Homburg.

In the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, Alfred Herrhausen, the manager of Deutsche Bank, was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the Red Army Faction, though this has never been proven.

==Coat of arms==
Bad Homburg&#x27;s civic coat of arms was granted in 1903 but is said to date from the 15th century on the basis of seals known from that time, although they show a saltire rather than the two adzes seen today (the saltire might be two unclear adzes). The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal canting. The colours, with silver adzes in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.

<text>A monolithic church or rock-hewn church is a church made from a single block of stone. Because freestanding rocks of sufficient size are rare, such edifices are usually hewn into the ground or into the side of a hill or mountain. They can be of comparable architectural complexity to constructed buildings.

The term &quot;monolithic church&quot; is used of churches in various countries, not least the complex of eleven churches in Lalibela, Ethiopia, believed to have been created in the 12th century.

==Ethiopia==
The eleven monolithic churches in Lalibela are:
* Church of the Redeemer 
* Saint Marie
* Mount Sinai 
* Golgotha 
* House of the Cross 
* House of the Virgins 
* Saint Gabriel 
* Abba Matta 
* Saint Mercurius 
* Immanuel
* Church of St. George (Bete Giyorgis)
The most famous of the edifices is the cross-shaped Church of St. George. Tradition credits its construction to the Zagwe dynasty King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, who was a devout Orthodox Tewahedo Christian. The medieval monolithic churches of this 12th-century &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; are situated in a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia near a traditional village. Lalibela is an important center of Ethiopian Christianity, and even today is a place of pilgrimage and devotion. Lalibela is one of the world&#x27;s heritage sites registered by UNESCO.

Many other churches were hewn from rock in Ethiopia, outside of Lalibela in Amhara Region. This practice was very common in Tigray, where the outside world knew of only a few such churches until the Catholic priest Abba Tewelde Medhin Josief presented a paper to the Third International Conference of Ethiopian Studies in which he announced the existence of over 120 churches, 90 of which were still in use. Despite Dr. Josief&#x27;s death soon after his presentation, research over the next few years raised the total number of these rock-hewn churches to 153, particularly in the districts Kola Tembien, Degua Tembien, Hawzen and Sa&#x27;esa Tsada Amba.

Their precise ages are not well defined but the majority were probably carved during the reigns of the emperors Dawit II (ca. 1380–1413 CE) and Zer’a Ya’iqob (1434–1468), and some possibly earlier when Anbessa Wudim (legendary date: 10th C.) or Yekuno Amlak (1270–1285) were in power.
According to local belief excavation of the churches was started by a group of missionaries known as the &#x27;Nine Saints&#x27;, who arrived in Ethiopia from the Mediterranean region during the fifth or sixth century. Together with their Ethiopian followers these missionaries inspired a long tradition of monasticism, promoting isolation in remote and highly inaccessible locations such as those in which the rock-hewn churches are found. Preferred lithologies for church hewing were Adigrat Sandstone and Enticho Sandstone. The tradition continues up to the present, as rock-hewn churches are still being excavated today.
Although the churches differ in design and structure, most consist basically of halls with a basilica architecture that includes three naves and a vestibule, pillars, vast ceilings, archways, and domes. Walls and ceilings are often decorated with rock carvings and colourful frescoes. Many of the medieval churches are still used today for Christian orthodox religious ceremonies and festivities.

==Other churches==

There are a number of monolithic churches elsewhere in the world. However, none have the free-standing external walls of the Lalibela churches. They instead more closely resemble cave monasteries in that they consist of tunnels converging into a single rock. Examples include:

* The Geghard monastery, Kotayk Province, Armenia
* The Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo, Bulgaria near Ruse
* The subterranean St. Jean Church in Aubeterre-sur-Dronne, France
* Church in Saint-Émilion, France
* Temppeliaukio Church in Helsinki, Finland
* Church of Saint Peter, Antakya, Turkey
* The subterranean rock churches in Cappadocia, Turkey which number beyond one thousand and contain some superb examples of Byzantine wall-paintings, representing both the academic classicizing trend in Byzantine art, and some archaic popular styles

<doc id="518088" wikidata="Q1738587" url="?curid=518088" title="Ken Clark (actor)">
<text>Kenneth Donovan Clark (June 4, 1927 – June 1, 2009) was an American B movie actor. He appeared in movies in the United States and Europe, including the Secret Agent 077 trilogy, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, and a number of Spaghetti Westerns.

==Early years==
Clark was born in Neffs, Ohio. He enlisted in the Navy when he was 17, and after being honorably discharged, he sought a career as an actor. When that effort was unsuccessful, he found employment as a model and as a construction worker. He also worked as a coal miner in the mid 1950s near Cadiz, Ohio.

==Acting career==
===Early career===
Clark was originally contracted to 20th Century Fox. While working for that studio, he acquired a reputation as a “beefcake” actor similar to Richard Egan. He appeared in a variety of genres of film, including crime (&quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot;), Western (&quot;The Last Wagon&quot;), and war film (&quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot;). Additionally, in one of his final roles for Fox, he appeared in Elvis Presley’s debut motion picture, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. Fox dropped Clark following that picture, and his roles in the following years were often in lower-budget films.

Clark&#x27;s most prominent role in American film came in 1958, when he was cast as Stewpot in &quot;South Pacific&quot;, an adaptation of the Broadway musical. His vocals were dubbed by Thurl Ravenscroft. Following the film’s premiere, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described Clark’s character as a “raffish gob.”

During this period, Clark made many guest star appearances on a variety of American TV shows, including four appearances on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. In 1959, he made an unsold private investigator TV pilot for a William Campbell Gault-inspired mystery series entitled &quot;Brock Callahan&quot;, directed by Don Siegel and written by Stirling Silliphant. That same year, he made a guest appearance in an episode of Western TV series &quot;Colt .45&quot;. During this period Clark had the lead in &quot;Attack of the Giant Leeches&quot; (1959) and &quot;12 to the Moon&quot; (1960). The former is regarded by some as Clark’s “most memorable film.”

===1960s: Agent 077===
During the 1960s and 1970s, like many other American actors Clark went to Italy appearing in several sword and sandal films, Spaghetti Westerns and Eurospy films, including the Hercules film &quot;The Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness&quot;, starring fellow American actor Dan Vadis, in 1963.

In 1965, Clark originated the role of Secret Agent Dick Mallory in the &quot;Agent 077&quot; trilogy modeled on James Bond. In one of the pictures from that trilogy, &quot;From the East with Fury&quot;, Mallory seeks to rescue a kidnapped nuclear scientist.

===1970s: Westerns===
In 1971, Clark appeared alongside James Garner in &quot;Un Uomo Chiamo Slitta&quot; (translated as &quot;A Man Called Sledge&quot;).

== Personal life and death ==
Clark was married to Bette Lola (Kruger) Blatt; a widow and her young daughter. They further had five children together and separated when he left for Europe to continue his acting career. Bette died in 1980.

According to fellow actor Robert Woods, Clark died of a heart attack in Rome, Italy on June 1, 2009, three days before his 82nd birthday, shortly after a taping for a program on the mid-1960s Eurospy genre on the TV series &quot;Starcult&quot;.

<text>Historic value (or historical value) is an increase in value because of historical aging. Original materials and signs of craftmanship are important to historic value, while later-date changes can diminish it.

==Records and documents==
With regard to items like library records or written documents, historical value can mean that the item contains &quot;unique information, regardless of age, which provides understanding of some aspect of the government and promotes the development of an informed and enlightened citizenry.&quot;

==Real property==
The increase in the value of a property, due to its historic value is based on the property&#x27;s age, quality, and rarity. A property&#x27;s historic value may be due to being associated with a historical activity, event, period, or person, or it may have particular historical architectural properties.

==Art-historic value==
In art, historic value is sometimes called art-historic value. This is independent of a work&#x27;s aesthetic value and is based on it being an important part of art history.

<text>Italian Somaliland (; ; ) was a protectorate and later colony of the Kingdom of Italy in present-day Somalia, which was ruled in the 19th century by the Sultanate of Hobyo and Majeerteen in the north, and in the south by the political entities; Hiraab Imamate and the Geledi Sultanate. 

Italy gradually secured much of the territory in the 1880s through a series of protection treaties. Starting in the 1890s, the Bimaal and Wa&#x27;dan revolts near Merca marked the beginning of Somali resistance to Italian expansion, coinciding with the rise of the anti-colonial Dervish movement in the north. By the end of 1927, following a two year military campaign against Somali rebels, Rome finally asserted authority over the entirety of Italian Somaliland.

In 1936, the region was integrated into Italian East Africa as the Somalia Governorate. This would last until Italy&#x27;s loss of the region in 1941, during the East African campaign of World War II. Italian Somalia then came under British military administration until 1950, when it became a United Nations trusteeship, the Trust Territory of Somalia under Italian administration. On 1 July 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia united with the former British Somaliland to form the Somali Republic.

==History==
The late 19th century had a huge impact in the Horn of Africa. The Somali Sultans that then controlled the region, such as Yusuf Ali Kenadid, Boqor Osman Mahamuud, and Olol Dinle entered into treaties with one of the European colonial powers Great Britain and France, or Abyssinia.

===First settlement===

At the end of the 19th century, a growing social-political movement developed within Italy to start expanding its influence, since many other European countries had already been doing so, which was effectively leaving Italy behind. Italy also had serious economic problems. It is also argued by some historians that Italy had a minor interest in the mutton and livestock that were then plentiful in Somalia, though whatever designs Italy may have had on the resource-challenged Somali landscape were undoubtedly subordinate to its interest in the region&#x27;s ports and the waters and lands to which they provided access.

Cesare Correnti organized an expedition under the &quot;Società Geografica Italiana&quot; in 1876. The next year, the travel journal &quot;L’Esploratore&quot; was established by Manfredo Camperio. The &quot;Società di Esplorazioni Commerciali in Africa&quot; was created in 1879, with the Italian industrial establishment involved as well. The &quot;Club Africano&quot;, which three years later became the &quot;Società Africana D’Italia&quot;, was also established in Somalia in 1880. The first recorded act of Somali resistance began in October 1893, when Vincenzo Filonardi disembarked at the city of Merca to create a colonial outpost. During the visit a captain of one of the Italian vessels, Lieutenant Maurizio Talmone, was assassinated.

===Majeerteen-Italian treaties===


In late 1888, Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid sent a treaty request to Italy to make his Sultanate of Hobyo an Italian protectorate. His rival Boqor Osman Mahamuud was to sign a similar agreement vis-a-vis his own Majeerteen Sultanate (Majeerteenia) the following year. Both rulers had entered into the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist goals, with Sultan Kenadid looking to use Italy&#x27;s support in his ongoing power struggle with Boqor Osman over the Majeerteen Sultanate, as well as in a separate conflict with the Hiraab Sultanate over an area to the south of Hobyo. In signing the agreements, the rulers also hoped to exploit the rival objectives of the European imperial powers so as to more effectively assure the continued independence of their territories. The Italians, for their part, were interested in the largely arid territory mainly because of its ports, which could grant them access to the strategically important Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aden.

The terms of each treaty specified that Italy was to steer clear of any interference in the Sultanates&#x27; respective administrations. In return for Italian arms and an annual subsidy, the Sultans conceded to a minimum of oversight and economic concessions. The Italians also agreed to dispatch a few ambassadors to promote both the Sultanates&#x27; and their own interests. The new protectorates were thereafter managed by Vincenzo Filonardi through a chartered company. An Anglo-Italian border protocol was later signed on 5 May 1894, followed by an agreement in 1906 between Cavalier Pestalozza and General Swaine acknowledging that Baran fell under the Majeerteen Sultanate&#x27;s administration.

The last piece of land acquired by Italy in Somalia in order to form Italian Somaliland was the Jubaland region. Britain ceded the territory in 1925 as a reward for the Italians having joined the Allies in World War I. The British retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD).

===Italo-Abyssinian campaign===

In January 1887 Italian troops from Somalia fought a battle against Ras Alula Engida&#x27;s militia in Dogali, Eritrea, where they lost 500 troops. The Prime Minister, Agostino Depretis, died shortly after this defeat in July 1887. Francesco Crispi replaced him as Prime Minister. On 2 May 1889, the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II and Italy signed the Treaty of Wuchale.

===Coastal settlement===
Italy gained control of the ports of the Benadir coastal area with the concession of a small strip of land on the coast from the Sultan of Zanzibar, and over the following decades, Italian settlement was encouraged. In 1905, Italy assumed the responsibility of creating a colony in southern Somalia, after several failed attempts. This followed revelations that the Benadir Company had tolerated or collaborated in the perpetuation of the slave trade. The administrative regulator was Governor Mercantelli, with the six subdivisions of Brava, Merca, Lugh, Itala, Bardera, and Jumbo. Following the assassination of an Italian Lieutenant by anti-colonial Somali rebels, Italian troops razed all villages east of the river Shabeelle in a nearly hundred-kilometre range in reprisal, while seizing livestock and killing Somali residents in the area.

On 5 April 1908, the Italian Parliament enacted a basic law to unite all of the parts of southern Somalia into an area called &quot;Somalia Italiana&quot;. The colonial power was then divided between the Parliament, the metropolitan government, and the colonial government. The power of the colonial government was the only power that was changed. The civil governor controlled export rights, regulated the rate of exchange, raised or lowered native taxes, and administered all civil services and matters relating to hunting, fishing, and conservation. The governor was in control of the police force, while nominating local residents and military arrangements.

From 5 April 1908 to 5 May 1936, the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops (&quot;Regio corpo truppe coloniali della Somalia Italiana&quot;), originally called the &quot;Guard Corps of Benadir&quot;, served as the territory&#x27;s formal military corps. At the start of its establishment, the force had 2,600 Italian officers. Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935.

Effective Italian control remained largely limited to the coastal areas until the early 1920s. After the collapse of the Dervish movement, wherein Mohammed Abdullah Hassan&#x27; was emir, rebellion and revolt occurred, with disputes arising between different clans in the colony. The government of the time served as a mediator while maintaining close control over the military.

===Colonial development and fascist era===

In 1920, a member of the Italian royal family, The Duca degli Abruzzi, who was also a famous explorer, would establish the &quot;Società Agricola Italo-Somala&quot; (SAIS) in order to explore the agricultural potential of the territory. That same year, the &quot;Duca&quot; founded the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi (&quot;Villabruzzi&quot;; Jowhar) as an agricultural settlement in Italian Somaliland. The area produced sugar, bananas and cotton. On 5 December 1923, Cesare Maria De Vecchi di Val Cismon was named Governor in charge of the new colonial administration.

In November 1920, the Banca d&#x27;Italia, the first modern bank in Italian Somaliland, was established in Mogadishu.

After World War I in 1925, Trans-Juba, which was then a part of British East Africa, was ceded to Italy. This concession was purportedly a reward for the Italians having joined the Allies in World War I.

Following an examination of the layout of the land, the Italians began new local infrastructure projects, including the construction of hospitals, farms and schools.

The relationship between the Sultanate of Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Kenadid refused the Italians&#x27; proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate so that they might then pursue their battle against the Somali religious and nationalist leader Muhammad Abdullah Hassan&#x27;s Dervish forces. Viewed as too much of a threat, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Eritrea. His son Ali Yusuf Kenadid succeeded him on the throne. In 1924, Governor Cesare Maria De Vecchi adopted a policy of disarmentation of the northern Somali sultanates. Sultan Ali Yusuf Kenadid was thereafter in turn exiled. The Dubats colonial troops and the Zaptié gendarmerie were extensively used by De Vecchi during these military campaigns. However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.

In 1926, the agricultural colony of &quot;Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi&quot; comprised 16 villages, with some 3,000 Somali and 200 Italian inhabitants, and was connected by a 114 km new railway to Mogadishu. Italian colonial policy followed two principles in Italian Somaliland: preservation of the dominant clan and ethnic configurations and respect for Islam as the territory&#x27;s religion.
In 1928, the Italian authorities built the Mogadishu Cathedral (&quot;Cattedrale di Mogadiscio&quot;). It was constructed in a Norman Gothic style, based on the Cefalù Cathedral in Cefalù, Sicily. Following its establishment, Umberto, Prince of Piedmont, the heir apparent to the Italian throne, made his first publicized visit to Mogadishu. To commemorate the visit, the Arch of Umberto was constructed. The arch was built at the center of Mogadishu Garden. The Mogadishu International Airport was constructed that same year. The facility was regarded as one of the finest in the region.

Following a two year long Somali resistance, in late 1927 Italy finally extended authority across the entire territory. In the early 1930s, the new Italian Governors, Guido Corni and Maurizio Rava, started a policy of assimilation of the Somalis. Many Somalis were enrolled in the Italian colonial army, and thousands of Italian colonists moved to live in Mogadishu. The city grew in size and some small manufacturing companies opened up. The Italians also settled in agricultural areas around the capital, such as Jowhar and Janale (&quot;Genale&quot;).

In 1930, there were 22,000 Italians living in Italian Somaliland, representing 2% of the territory&#x27;s population. The majority resided in the capital Mogadishu, with other Italian communities concentrated in Jowhar, Adale (&quot;Itala&quot;), Janale, Jamame and Kismayo.

In October 1934, Umberto, Prince of Piedmont, made his second publicized visit to Italian Somaliland. King Victor Emmanuel III would also travel to the territory, arriving on 3 November that same year, accompanied by Emilio de Bono, after a non-stop flight from Rome. They were welcomed by the Governor Maurizio Rava and other colonial administrators. The King then traveled to &quot;Villabruzzi&quot; on 5 November and then returned to Mogadishu, where he celebrated his 65th birthday on 11 November. Following his visit to Italian Somaliland, new maps and 14 stamps were published. To commemorate his visit, an Arch of Triumph was constructed in Mogadishu in 1934.
===Italian East Africa (1936–1941)===


By 1935, Mogadishu began to serve as a major naval base and port for the Italians. The then Prime Minister of Italy, Benito Mussolini, regarded Greater Somalia (&quot;La Grande Somalia&quot;) as the crown jewel in Italy&#x27;s colonial empire on the continent. He viewed himself less as an invader than as a liberator of the occupied Somali territories, including the Ogaden region, to which the Ethiopian Empire laid claim. On this basis, he justified his plan to invade Ethiopia. In October 1935, the southern front of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was launched into Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland. The Italian General Rodolfo Graziani commanded the invasion forces in the south. Over 40,000 Somali troops served in the war, mostly as combat units. They backed up the over 80,000 Italians serving alongside them at the start of the offensive. Many of the Somalis were veterans from serving in Italian Libya. During the invasion of Ethiopia, Mogadishu served as a chief supply base.

In June 1936, after the war ended, Italian Somaliland became part of Italian East Africa (&quot;Africa Orientale Italiana&quot;) forming the Somalia Governorate. The new colony of the Italian Empire also included Ethiopia and Eritrea. To commemorate the victory, an Arch of Triumph was constructed in Mogadishu.

From 1936 to 1940, new roads were constructed in the region, such as the &quot;Imperial Road&quot; from Mogadishu to Addis Ababa. New railways (114 km from Mogadishu to Jowhar) and many schools, hospitals, ports and bridges were also built.

Since the start of the colony, many Somali troops fought in the so-called &quot;Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali&quot;. The soldiers were enrolled as Dubats, Zaptié and Bande irregolari. During World War II, these troops were regarded as a wing of the Italian Army&#x27;s Infantry Division, as was the case in Libya and Eritrea. The Zaptié were considered the best: they provided a ceremonial escort for the Italian Viceroy (Governor) as well as the territorial police. There were already more than one thousand such soldiers in 1922. In 1941, in Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia, 2,186 Zaptìé plus an additional 500 recruits under training officially constituted a part of the Carabinieri. They were organised into a battalion commanded by Major Alfredo Serranti that defended Culqualber (Ethiopia) for three months until this military unit was destroyed by the Allies. After heavy fighting, all the Italian Carabinieri, including the Somali troops, received full military honors from the British.
In 1935, there were over 50,000 Italian settlers living in Italian Somaliland, constituting 5% of the territory&#x27;s population. Of those, 20,000 resided in Mogadishu (called officially in Italian language:&quot;Mogadiscio&quot;), representing around 40% of the city&#x27;s 50,000 residents. Mogadishu was an administrative capital of Italian East Africa, and new buildings were erected in the Italian architectural tradition. Other Italian settler communities were concentrated in Jowhar, Adale (&quot;Itala&quot;), Janale, Jamame, and Kismayo. These figures do not include the more than 220,000 Italian soldiers stationed throughout Italian Somaliland during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.

The colony was also one of the most developed in Africa in terms of the standard of living of the colonists and of the local inhabitants, mainly in the urban areas. By 1940, the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi (&quot;Villabruzzi&quot;; Jowhar) had a population of 12,000 people, of whom nearly 3,000 were Italian Somalis, and enjoyed a notable level of development with a small manufacturing area with agricultural industries (sugar mills, etc.).

In the second half of 1940, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland, and ejected the British. The Italians also occupied Kenyan areas bordering Jubaland around the villages of Moyale and Buna. Although the Italian leadership believed were unsure where the British army would land first, Operation Canvas, to capture southern Somalia occurred first in January 1941, whereas the subsequent attempt to capture British Somaliland happened two months later in Operation Appearance.

In the spring of 1941, Britain regained control of British Somaliland and conquered Italian Somaliland with the Ogaden. However, until the summer of 1943, there was an Italian guerrilla war in all the areas of the former Italian East Africa.

===British Military Administration (1941–1950)===

British forces occupied Italian Somaliland and militarily administered the territory as well as British Somaliland. Faced with growing Italian political pressure inimical to continued British tenure and Somali aspirations for independence, the Somalis and the British came to see each other as allies. The first modern Somali political party, the Somali Youth Club (SYC), was subsequently established in Mogadishu in 1943; it was later renamed the Somali Youth League (SYL). The SYL evolved into the dominant party and had a moderate ideology. Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) party served as the principal opposition to the right, although its platform was generally in agreement with that of the SYL.

In November 1949, the United Nations finally opted to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (later Hizbia Dastur Mustaqbal Somali, or HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL), that were then agitating for independence — that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.

===Trust Territory of Somalia (1950–1960)===

In 1949, when the British military administration ended, Italian Somaliland became a United Nations trusteeship known as the Trust Territory of Somaliland. Under Italian administration, this trust territory lasted ten years, from 1950 to 1960, with legislative elections held in 1956 and 1959.

On 1 April 1950, the &quot;Amministrazione fiduciaria italiana della Somalia&quot; (AFIS) began its rule. A deployment of 6,500 troops landed in Somalia to assist the establishment of AFIS under the leadership of Giovanni Fornari. Fornari&#x27;s three year tenure would mark the most difficult years of the Trusteeship. The first half of AFIS&#x27;s decade long rule would be marked by animosity and conflict between the Italian authorities and the Somali Youth League. Numerous SYL officials who had gained positions of prominence during the era of British Military Administration were either demoted, removed from their positions or imprisoned by Italians officials. These attempts to marginalize the league would lead to demonstrations across the country which were strongly repressed by the government, who had at the time come to decision not cooperate or concede to the SYL&#x27;s plans for independence. In the 1956 parliamentary election, the Somali Youth League would win 54.29% of votes versus 26.01% for the nearest party, the Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali. The growing power of the SYL would lead Italian officials to take a more conciliatory stance towards the organization. The SYL would also earn 416 of the 663 seats in the 1958 municipal election, with the HDMS securing 175 seats. By the 1959 parliamentary election, SYL would capture an even greater share of votes by winning 75.58% of the total ballot.

Italian was an official language in Italian Somaliland during the Fiduciary Mandate, as well as in the first years of independence. By 1952, the majority of Somalis had some understanding of the language.

===Independence (1960)===
On 1 July 1960, the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) and the former British Somaliland united to form the Somali Republic, with Mogadishu as the nation&#x27;s capital. This day is celebrated as Somalia&#x27;s Independence Day.

A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal and other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Abdulcadir Muhammed Aden as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic, and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. On 20 July 1961, through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960.

<text>Michael C. Vaughn is a fictional character on the television series &quot;Alias&quot;. Played by Michael Vartan, Vaughn is one of Sydney Bristow&#x27;s co-workers and her ongoing love interest. He, like Sydney, is skilled in a variety of areas. His language abilities, shown in various episodes, include French, Spanish, Italian, and others.

Throughout the first three seasons, his code name was BoyScout; from season four on, it was Shotgun. In season five, Vaughn&#x27;s birth name was revealed to be André Micheaux. His relationship with Sydney was included in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the best TV couples of all time.

==Character biography==
Michael Vaughn was originally Sydney Bristow&#x27;s handler while she was working as a double agent for the CIA within SD-6. But gradually, the two agents developed romantic feelings for each other as they worked closely together to bring down this corrupt espionage organization. This did little to endear him to Sydney&#x27;s father Jack Bristow, another double agent within SD-6. Vaughn and Sydney&#x27;s relationship became openly intimate after SD-6 was destroyed during the show&#x27;s second season. When Sydney was apparently killed in a fire a few months later, a heartbroken Vaughn left the CIA and found work as a French teacher. He also became involved with NSC liaison Lauren Reed and married her some time during Sydney&#x27;s two-year disappearance. Once he discovered that Sydney was still alive, Vaughn returned to the CIA and quickly saw his feelings for her reignite, a fact that caused a great deal of tension in his marriage to Lauren. Eventually, it was revealed that Lauren was a double agent for The Covenant and that Lauren seduced him in order to gain information on Sydney.

Vaughn became obsessed with her capture and was even encouraged by Jack Bristow to kill her. He eventually captures Lauren and she tells him that she fell in love with him, but then Sydney came back and he didn&#x27;t need her anymore. She also claimed that the Covenant hadn&#x27;t been in contact with her for two years by that point. Her &#x27;confession&#x27; is ambiguous as she does appear to have developed feelings for Vaughn, as is evident by her reaction to Sark&#x27;s earlier observation that it killed her when Michael dropped his gun, which was trained on her, to save Sydney. He plans to douse her in hydrochloric acid but is thwarted by Katya Derevko. Despite this, he ends up killing her at the end of the third season. This act continued to haunt him into the fourth season even though he shot Lauren to prevent her from killing Sydney.

Following Lauren&#x27;s demise (and between the third and fourth seasons), Vaughn appeared to go into an emotional tailspin that culminated with him setting fire to his own house. He went through a month of psych evaluations before informing his best friend and fellow agent Eric Weiss of his resignation from the CIA. In reality, Vaughn had been recruited into a black ops division of the CIA called Authorized Personnel Only (APO), along with Sydney, Jack, and Marcus Dixon (Weiss and Marshall Flinkman would soon follow). One of his new duties was to keep an eye on Arvin Sloane, who had been appointed director of APO despite his long history of criminal activities as the head of SD-6. Vaughn successfully resumed his romantic relationship with Sydney during their first mission for APO.

The first season established that Michael Vaughn&#x27;s father was one of several CIA agents killed in the line of duty by Irina Derevko, Sydney&#x27;s mother. Bill Vaughn&#x27;s death was questioned in season four after Vaughn found a journal apparently written by his father with entries dated three years after his death in 1979. Vaughn&#x27;s subsequent investigation led him to conduct a secret mission in collaboration with Sydney; he turned rogue by the end of the episode &quot;Nightingale&quot;. However, he returned to APO after discovering his father really was dead and that the journal entries had been part of a ruse devised by Elena Derevko. At the end of the fourth season Vaughn proposed to Sydney and the two took their long-delayed vacation to Santa Barbara. During this car ride he confessed that his real name was not Michael Vaughn and implied that his first allegiance was not to the CIA. The season, however, ended in a car crash that cut his explanation short. In the premiere of season 5, Vaughn is taken by an armed group from the crash site. He is thought to be a traitor when he is recovered, and reveals his real name as André Michaux; his father was actually a mathematician associated with a group known as Prophet Five. Seven years ago, he had been approached by a woman named Renée Rienne, whose father worked with Vaughn&#x27;s at Prophet Five, and has since worked with her to uncover more information about the group. At the end of the episode, he is shot by a rogue agent disguised as a CIA executive. Shortly before this, he learned that Sydney was pregnant with his child.

At the end of episode &quot;Maternal Instinct&quot; (#5.11), it is revealed that Vaughn is still alive in Bhutan living with monks connected to the outside world. One monk informs him that Sydney gave birth to their daughter. Afterwards, in the episode &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Sydney Bristow&quot; (#5.12), it is revealed that both Sydney and Jack Bristow know that Vaughn is still alive. In the episode &quot;I See Dead People (#5.14) the information is revealed only to the other members of the APO team when they recover a chip from within Renée Rienne and Vaughn is forced out of hiding by Anna Espinosa, who is posing as Sydney. Vaughn and the disguised Espinosa find that Vaughn had a chip similar to the one inside Renée, his father claiming that the scar was from a bike accident. The chip leads them to an abandoned bunker beneath a German park. While Espinosa held hostage the clerk of the jewelry store that leads to the bunker, Vaughn breaks into it. Just as he finds the bunker, Espinosa attempts to shoot him, but finds that Vaughn knew of the deception and gave her an unloaded gun. In the ensuing scuffle, just as Espinosa attempts to shoot him with a new gun, the real Sydney sneaks up behind her and shoots her. Reunited with Sydney, Vaughn returns to Los Angeles and meets his daughter, Isabelle.

In the next episode, it is revealed that Jack told Vaughn while he was in the hospital that Prophet Five would stop at nothing to silence him, and that Vaughn was in no position to fight back. Jack gave Vaughn sodium morphate, a drug that slows the heart to mimic death, and Vaughn&#x27;s body was picked up by one of Jack&#x27;s contacts and he was shipped off to Nepal.

In the series finale, Vaughn participates in a wide variety of missions to bring about the fall of Prophet Five, Sloane and Irina. At the very end of the final episode a flash forward reveals that Sydney and Vaughn are married and semi-retired. They have a second child, Jack (named after Sydney&#x27;s father).

<text>A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail is a 1998 travel book by the writer Bill Bryson, chronicling his attempt to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail during the spring and summer of 1996. For much of his journey, Bryson was accompanied by his friend Matt Angerer (pseudonymously called &quot;Stephen Katz&quot; in the book), who had previously appeared in Bryson&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe&quot;.

Written in a comic style, the book mixes accounts of Bryson&#x27;s walk with broader discussions about the Trail&#x27;s history, and the sociology, ecology, conservation status and people of the places Bryson walked through.

== Plot ==
The book starts with Bryson explaining his curiosity about the Appalachian Trail near his house. He and his old friend Stephen Katz start hiking the trail from Georgia in the South, and stumble in the beginning with the difficulties of getting used to their equipment; Bryson also soon realizes how difficult it is to travel with his friend, who is a crude, overweight recovering alcoholic, and even less prepared for the ordeal than he is. Overburdened, they soon discard much extra food and equipment to lighten their loads.

After hiking for what seemed to him a large distance, they realize they have still barely begun while in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and that the whole endeavor is simply too much for them. They skip a huge section of the trail, beginning again in Roanoke, Virginia. The book recounts Bryson&#x27;s desire to seek easier terrain as well as &quot;a powerful urge not to be this far south any longer&quot;. This section of the hike finally ends (after nearly 800 miles (1,300 km) of hiking) with Bryson going on a book tour and Katz returning to Des Moines, Iowa, to work.

In the following months Bryson continues to hike several smaller parts of the trail, including a visit to Centralia, Pennsylvania, the site of a coal seam fire, and eventually reunites with Katz to hike the Hundred-Mile Wilderness in Maine, which again proves too daunting. Ultimately Bryson hiked about 40% of the trail. In the 21st century, about 25% of thru-hike attempts are successful. Bryson quotes the older figure of 10%.

At the time of his attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail, Bryson was aged in his forties.

== Writing process ==

Bryson admitted that he found the book hard to write, remarking in an interview that &quot;the thing about walking is that it&#x27;s not eventful. It doesn&#x27;t generate material. A long walk, a really long walk, is an exceedingly repetitious experience…when I finally got a book out of it, I was kind of astounded.&quot; He described himself as &quot;wretchedly homesick&quot; during his hike and that he had had to fictionalize some of Angerer&#x27;s behavior, as &quot;he was quite depressed at this time...he just felt like life had kicked him in the balls and he wasn’t doing very well. And I portrayed all of that. And it was just depressing...my revelation with that was, instead of making him just depressed, I just made him angry, which he also was. I made it much more that he was angry with the trail rather than angry with life...so it really became the two of us against the trail. And then it started to work much better, I think, as a narrative.&quot;

Whilst pleased with his accomplishments on the Trail, Bryson expressed regret that he and Angerer had not completed the 100-Mile Wilderness section. He also identified the Berkshires as the part of the Trail that he would most like to re-hike.

== Film adaptation ==

In 2005, Robert Redford announced, and later confirmed, that he would star in and produce an adaptation of Bryson&#x27;s book into a film, and that he would play Bryson. He also hoped that his erstwhile co-star and friend, Paul Newman, would team up with him to play the role of Katz, although he jokingly expressed doubt as to whether the health-conscious Newman would consider putting on enough weight to accurately portray the rotund Katz. However, Newman retired from acting in May 2007 and died in 2008.

In February 2007, Chris Columbus, director of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, was reported to have agreed to direct the adaptation. However, in January 2008, &quot;the Hollywood Reporter&quot;, while noting that the script was delayed due to the Hollywood writers&#x27; strike, reported that Barry Levinson, the Academy Award–winning director of &quot;Rain Man&quot;, was in talks to direct.

Redford has said of the project
In February 2012, it was reported that novelist Richard Russo, during a speech at Union College, confirmed that he was working on the screenplay.

By November 2013, Nick Nolte had been cast to costar as Katz. Larry Charles (of &quot;Borat&quot; and &quot;Brüno&quot;) was briefly attached as director, but eventually the job went to Ken Kwapis, whose most recent film was &quot;Big Miracle&quot; and who was a key figure on the U.S. television series &quot;The Office&quot;. The screenplay was by Michael Arndt, credited as Rick Kerb, and Bill Holderman, who is a producer at Redford&#x27;s Wildwood Enterprises. Shooting began in spring 2014. The movie was largely filmed at Amicalola Falls State Park, in Dawsonville, Georgia, including scenes at The Lodge at Amicalola Falls.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2015, and was released in theaters on September 2, 2015, by Broad Green Pictures.

== Reception ==

&quot;A Walk In the Woods&quot; was named by &quot;CNN&quot; as the funniest travel book ever written. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that readers, &quot;may find themselves turning the pages with increasing amusement and anticipation as they discover that they&#x27;re in the hands of a satirist of the first rank&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the book as a &quot;wry, well-researched account&quot;.

The book was met with anger amongst some members of the Appalachian Trail community, with letters to the &quot;Appalachian Trailway News&quot;, a newsletter of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, excoriating Bryson for his perceived cynicism, ill-informed complaints and demeaning portrayal of Southerners. Despite this, it has been credited with a 50% increase in long-distance hiker numbers during the two years after publication.

Angerer claimed in a 2015 interview with the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; that the book was &quot;true for the most part&quot;, but disagreed with Bryson&#x27;s portrayal of his initial physical fitness and thought that his purported womanizing had been exaggerated. He died in June 2023 at the age of 71.

<doc id="518100" wikidata="Q3044425" url="?curid=518100" title="Language demographics of Quebec">
<text>This article presents the current language demographics of the Canadian province of Quebec.

==Demographic terms==
The complex nature of Quebec&#x27;s linguistic situation, with individuals who are often bilingual or multilingual, requires the use of multiple terms in order to describe the languages which people speak.
;Francophone: Speaking French as a first language.
;Anglophone: Speaking English as a first language.
;Allophone: Having a mother tongue other than English or French.
; Mother tongue : The first language learned by a person, which may or may not still be used by that individual in adulthood, is a basic measure of a population&#x27;s language. However, with the high number of mixed francophone-anglophone marriages and the reality of multilingualism in Montreal, this description does not give a true linguistic portrait of Quebec. It is, however, still essential, for example in order to calculate the assimilation rate. Statistics Canada defines mother tongue as the first language learned in childhood and still spoken; it does not presuppose literacy in that or any language.
; Home language : This is the language most often spoken at home and is currently preferred to identify francophones, anglophones, and allophones. This descriptor has the advantage of pointing out the current usage of languages. However, it fails to describe the language that is most used at work, which may be different.
; Knowledge of official languages : This measure describes which of the two official languages of Canada a person can speak informally. This relies on the person&#x27;s own evaluation of his/her linguistic competence and can prove misleading.
; First official language learned: Measures whether English or French are the first of the two official languages learned; it places allophones into English or French linguistic communities.
; Official language minority: Based on first official language learned, but placing half of the people equally proficient since childhood in both English and French into each linguistic community; it is used by the Canadian government to determine the demand for minority language services in a region

==Current demographics==
=== Knowledge of languages ===
The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses. The following figures are from the 2021 Canadian census and the 2016 Canadian census, and lists languages that were selected by at least one per cent of respondents. 
=== Overview as of the 2016 census ===

*Population: 8,164,361
*Official language: French
*Majority group: Francophone (77.1%)
*Minority groups: Allophone (13.15%), Anglophone (7.45%), Aboriginals (0.6%), native speakers of two languages or more (2.3%)

Among the ten provinces of Canada, Quebec is the only one whose majority is francophone. Quebec&#x27;s population accounts for 23.9% of the Canadian population, and Quebec&#x27;s francophones account for about 90% of Canada&#x27;s French-speaking population.

English-speaking Quebecers are a large population in the Greater Montreal Area, where they have built a well-established network of educational, social, economic, and cultural institutions. There are also historical English-speaking communities in the Eastern Townships, the Ottawa Valley, the Laurentians (such as Ste. Agathe des Monts, Ste. Adolphe de Howard, Arundel, Lachute, Mont Tremblant) and the Gaspé Peninsula. By contrast, the population of Quebec City, the second-largest city in the province, is almost exclusively francophone. Overall in the province the proportion of native English speakers dropped significantly between 1951 and 2001, from 13.8% to 8% in 2001, while it has since stabilized.

The remaining 13% of the population, known as allophones, are native speakers of more than 30 different languages. With the exception of Aboriginal peoples in Quebec (the Inuit, Huron, Mohawks, Iroquois, Abenaki, Montagnais, Cree, Innu, Ojibway etc.), the majority are products of recent immigration and often come to adopt either English or French as home languages.

===Numbers of native speakers===

Of the population of 8,501,833 counted by the 2021 census, 8,406,905 completed the section about their first language. Of these, 8,098,355 gave singular responses. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

Numerous other languages were also counted, but only languages with more than 2,000 native speakers are shown.
&quot;Other&quot; groupings include listed languages with less than 2,000 native speakers as well as entries listed as &quot;not otherwise specified&quot; or &quot;not included elsewhere&quot;.(Percentages shown are the ratio between the number of singular responses and the number of total responses.)

===Cities===
All figures are rounded to 0.01%.

===Montreal===
There are today three distinct territories in the Greater Montreal Area: the metropolitan region, Montreal Island, and Montreal, the city. (The island and the city were coterminous for a time between the municipal merger of 2002 and the &quot;demerger&quot; which occurred in January 2006.)

Quebec allophones account for 9% of the population of Quebec. The vast majority of them (88%) reside in Greater Montreal. Anglophones are also concentrated in the region of Montreal (80% of their numbers).

Francophones account for 65% of the total population of Greater Montreal, anglophones 12.6% and allophones 20.4%. On the island of Montreal, the francophone majority dropped to 46.96% by 2011, a net decline since the 1970s owing to francophone outmigration to more affluent suburbs in Laval and the South Shore (fr. &quot;Rive-Sud&quot;) and an influx of allophone immigrants. The anglophones account for 16.64% of the population and the allophones 35.24%.

=== Bilingualism ===

According to the 2016 census, the rate of bilingualism in English and French is at 44.5 percent, a figure which continues to grow at a much faster rate in Quebec than in the rest of Canada. Bilingual speakers represented 42.6 percent in 2011, and 40.6 percent in 2006 (in 2016, it was 17.9 percent in Canada overall, up from just at 17.5 percent in 2011).

While 44.5 percent of the total population of Quebec reported being bilingual in 2016, this figure rose to 70 percent for those aged 14 to 17.

Almost 90 cities, towns or boroughs in Quebec are considered officially bilingual, a designation allowing them to offer services, post signage and mail communications in the country&#x27;s two official languages.

===Birth rate===
At 1.74 children per woman, Quebec&#x27;s 2008 fertility rate was above the Canada-wide rate of 1.59, and had increased for five consecutive years. However, it remained below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. This contrasts with its fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society. Although Quebec is home to only 23.9% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

===Immigration===
In 2003, Quebec accepted some 37,619 immigrants. A large proportion of these immigrants originated from francophone countries and countries that are former French colonies. Countries from which significant numbers of people immigrate include Haiti, Congo, Lebanon, Morocco, Rwanda, Syria, Algeria, France and Belgium. Under the Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec has sole responsibility for selecting most immigrants destined to the province (see related article, Immigration to Canada).

===Interprovincial migration===

Interprovincial migration, especially to Ontario, results in a net loss of population in Quebec. The numbers of French-speaking Quebecers leaving the province tend to be similar to the number entering, while immigrants to Quebec are more likely to leave. Outmigration has most affected the English-speaking minority in Quebec, accounting for its population being significantly reduced since the 1970s.

==Legislation==
* 1988 – Official Languages Act (federal)
* 1982 – Articles 14, 16–23, 55 and 57 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (federal)
* 1977 – Charter of the French Language (provincial)
* 1974 – Official Language Act (provincial)
* 1969 – An Act to promote the French language in Quebec (provincial)
* 1969 – Official Languages Act (federal)

There are two sets of language laws in Quebec, which overlap and in various areas conflict or compete with each other: the laws passed by the Parliament of Canada and the laws passed by the National Assembly of Quebec.

Since 1982, both parliaments have had to comply with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalized a number of fundamental human rights and educational rights of minorities in all provinces (education is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Prior to this, Quebec was effectively the sole province required constitutionally to finance the educational needs of its linguistic minority. Ontario and Quebec are both required to finance schools for their principal religious minorities (Roman Catholic in Ontario, Protestant in Quebec), but only in Quebec is the minority almost completely composed of speakers of the minority language. (Quebec also provided English schools for anglophone Roman Catholics.) In 1997, an amendment to the constitution allowed for Quebec to replace its system of denominational school boards with a system of linguistic school boards.

The federal language law and regulations seek to make it possible for all Canadian anglophone and francophone citizens to obtain services in the language of their choice from the federal government. Ottawa promotes the adoption of bilingualism by the population and especially among the employees in the public service.

In contrast, the Quebec language law and regulations promote French exclusively as the common public language of all Quebecers. Although Quebec currently respects most of the constitutional rights of its anglophone minority, it took a series of court challenges to enforce. The government of Quebec promotes the adoption and the use of French and limits the presence of English. This is to counteract the trend towards the anglicization of the population of Quebec.

In May 2022, The CAQ Quebec government of François Legault passed Bill 96, with 78 MNAs in favour (from the CAQ and Québec solidaire) and 29 against (from the Liberal Party and Parti Québécois). The bill strengthens the 1970s Charter of the French Language. In that same year, François Legault caused controversy when he said that Quebec risked being a Louisiana (which used to be French speaking but is no longer) if Quebec doesn&#x27;t have more control over immigration policy.

===Anglicization and Francization===
(see: Language contact, Stratum (linguistics), Linguistic description, Sociolinguistics)

The following table shows summary data on the language shifts which have occurred in Quebec between 1971, year of the first Canadian census asking questions about home language, and 2001 :

The second column starting on the left shows the number of native speakers of each language, the third shows the number of speakers using it at home.

The fourth column shows the difference between the number of speakers according to home language and those who speak it as mother tongue.

The fifth column shows the quotient of the division between the number of home language speakers and the native speakers.

Until the 1960s, the francophone majority of Quebec had only very weak assimilation power and, indeed, did not seek to assimilate non-francophones. Although the quantity of non-francophones adopted French throughout history, the pressure and, indeed, consensus from French-language and English-language institutions was historically towards the anglicization, not francization, of allophones in Quebec. Only a high fertility rate allowed the francophone population to keep increasing in absolute numbers in spite of assimilation and emigration. In the early 1960s, with the rise of irreligion, the fertility rate of the Quebecois began declining in a manner consistent with most developed societies, and some in Quebec&#x27;s francophone majority feared the beginning of a demographic collapse: unlike the anglophone sphere, the francophone sphere was not assimilating allophones, and lower fertility rates were therefore much more determinative.
Quebec&#x27;s language legislation has tried to address this since the 1960s when, as part of the Quiet Revolution, French Canadians chose to move away from Church domination and towards a stronger identification with state institutions as development instruments for their community. Instead of repelling non-Catholic immigrants from the French-language public school system and towards the Protestant-run English system, for instance, immigrants would now be encouraged to attend French-language schools. The ultimate quantifiable goal of Quebec&#x27;s language policy is to establish French as Quebec&#x27;s common public language.

Recent census data show that goal has not been reached as successfully as hoped. After almost 30 years of enforcement of the Charter of the French Language, approximately 49% of allophone immigrants – including those who arrived before the Charter&#x27;s adoption in 1977 – had assimilated to English, down from 71% in 1971, but still considerably more than anglophones&#x27; overall share of the province&#x27;s population. This leads some Quebecers, particularly those who support the continued role of French as the province&#x27;s common public language, to question whether the policy is being implemented successfully. The phenomenon is linked to the linguistic environments which cohabit Montreal – Quebec&#x27;s largest city, Canada&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area, and home to a number of communities, neighbourhoods, and even municipalities in which English is the de facto common language. The anglophone minority&#x27;s capacity to assimilate allophones and even francophones has therefore compensated to a large extent for the outmigration of anglophones to other provinces and even to the United States.

A number of socio-economic factors are thought to be responsible for this reality. They include: the historic role of the English language in Canada and the U.S.; its growing influence in the business and scientific world; the perceived advantages of learning English that result from this prominence and which are particularly appealing to allophones who have yet to make a linguistic commitment; the historic association of English with immigrant Quebecers and French with ethnic French-Canadian Québécois, which plays into linguistic and identity politics; and the post-industrial clustering of anglophones into Montreal and away from regional communities. These factors go not only to allophone immigrants&#x27; direct linguistic assimilation, but also their indirect assimilation through contact with the private sector. Although the Charter of the French language makes French the official language of the workplace, the socio-economic factors cited here also often make English a requirement for employment, especially in Montreal, and to a lesser extent outside of it, notably in Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region, bordering Ontario, and in the Eastern Townships, particularly Sherbrooke.

The result is a largely bilingual workforce. Francophones are often compelled to learn English to find employment (particularly in the Montreal area), while anglophones in the province are pressured to do the same with French, and allophones are asked to learn both. Census data adjusted for education and professional experience show that bilingual francophones had a greater income than bilingual anglophones by the year 2000.

In 2001, 29% of Quebec workers declared using English, either solely (193,320), mostly (293,320), equally with French (212,545) or regularly (857,420). The proportion rose to 37% in the Montreal metropolitan area, where bilingualism is common. Outside Montreal, on the other hand, the proportion of anglophones has shrunk to 3% of the population and, except on the Ontario and U.S. borders, struggles to maintain a critical mass to support educational and health institutions – a reality that only immigrants and francophones usually experience in the other provinces. Unilingual anglophones are however still on the decline because of the higher English-French bilingualism of the community&#x27;s younger generations.

Not all analysts are entirely comfortable with this picture of the status of the English language in Quebec. For example, a more refined analysis of the Census data shows that a great deal of anglicization continues to occur in the communities traditionally associated with the English-language group, e.g., the Chinese, Italian, Greek and Indo-Pakistani groups. Nevertheless, a majority of new immigrants in every census since 1971 have chosen French more often than English as their adopted language. Statistics Canada&#x27;s 2011 National Household Survey of Canada reported that for the first time in modern history, the first official language of more than half of Quebec immigrants was French. Those who spoke French as their first official language formed 51.1% of all immigrants to the province, while an additional 16.3% spoke both French and English; among those who immigrated to the province between 2006 and 2011, the proportion who spoke French as their first official language was 58.8%.

<doc id="518104" wikidata="Q2578825" url="?curid=518104" title="Utility fog">
<text>Utility fog (also referred to as foglets) is a hypothetical collection of tiny nanobots that can replicate a physical structure. As such, it is a form of self-reconfiguring modular robotics.

==Conception==
The term was coined by John Storrs Hall in 1989. Hall thought of it as a nanotechnological replacement for car seatbelts. The robots would be microscopic, with extending arms reaching in several different directions, and could perform three-dimensional lattice reconfiguration. Grabbers at the ends of the arms would allow the robots (or foglets) to mechanically link to one another and share both information and energy, enabling them to act as a continuous substance with mechanical and optical properties that could be varied over a wide range. Each foglet would have substantial computing power, and would be able to communicate with its neighbors.

In the original application as a replacement for seatbelts, the swarm of robots would be widely spread out, and the arms loose, allowing air flow between them. In the event of a collision the arms would lock into their current position, as if the air around the passengers had abruptly frozen solid. The result would be to spread any impact over the entire surface of the passenger&#x27;s body.

While the foglets would be micro-scale, construction of the foglets would require full molecular nanotechnology. Hall suggests that each bot may be in the shape of a dodecahedron with twelve arms extending outwards. Each arm would have four degrees of freedom. The foglets&#x27; bodies would be made of aluminum oxide rather than combustible diamond to avoid creating a fuel air explosive.

Hall and his correspondents soon realized that utility fog could be manufactured en masse to occupy the entire atmosphere of a planet and replace any physical instrumentality necessary to human life. By foglets exerting concerted force, an object or human could be carried from location to location. Virtual buildings could be constructed and dismantled within moments, enabling the replacement of existing cities and roads with farms and gardens. While molecular nanotech might also replace the need for biological bodies, utility fog would remain a useful peripheral with which to perform physical engineering and maintenance tasks. Thus, utility fog also came to be known as &quot;the machine of the future&quot;.

<text>Edward Leon Sciaky (April 2, 1948–January 29, 2004) was an American rock radio disc jockey who spent his broadcasting career in the Philadelphia area.

==Early life and education==
He was born in New York City and raised in Philadelphia, where he graduated from Central High School, and then from Temple University where he majored in mathematics.

==Career==
Sciaky became known for promoting new talent, helping establish the careers of scores of artists, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, David Bowie, Janis Ian, and Yes. Sciaky can also be heard introducing AC/DC on the Live from the Atlantic Studios CD off their 1997 boxset, Bonfire.

He was one of the first FM disc jockeys who thrived when given the chance to choose their own music, venturing beyond playing pop hits. Frequently, he would play lesser known songs that had personal meaning for himself or listeners. He was a good friend to many musicians who enjoyed his intelligent interviews and his knowledge of rock-n-roll. One of his best recording artist friends was Billy Joel, who at 23, had just released his &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; album and was trying to promote it. Sciaky subsequently featured it on one his Sigma Sound Studios broadcasts.

Sciaky provided the master tape of Yes&#x27;s live version of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; for the band&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Yesyears&quot; box set.

Sciaky&#x27;s broadcasting career, all in the Philadelphia area, included WRTI, WHAT, WXUR, WDAS, WMMR, WIOQ, WYSP, WMMR (again), and WMGK.

In 2003, Sciaky&#x27;s &quot;Sunday With Springsteen&quot; specialty show won a &quot;Best Of Philly&quot; award from &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted Sciaky into their Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Personal life== 

Sciaky lived on the Main Line, near Philadelphia. His house was home to a substantial, well-organized music collection, as well as a rather large iguana, perhaps five feet long. The resting iguana would sometimes startle first time guests when it moved slightly and caught their attention.

He was married to Judy (Feldshur) Sciaky from 1969 until his death. They had one child in 1985, Monica, an opera singer with a doctorate in vocal arts, who married Eiki Isomura, who has his doctorate in conducting and is the son of violist Kazuhide Isomura.

==Death==
Sciaky died of complications from diabetes on January 29, 2004, in New York City, at the age of 55. E Street drummer Max Weinberg and singer-songwriter Steve Forbert served as pallbearers at his funeral, which was attended by 1500 people.

<text>Lauren Reed is a fictional character played by Melissa George in the ABC television series &quot;Alias&quot;. She is Michael Vaughn&#x27;s wife during the third season of the series.

==Character biography==

Lauren is the daughter of Senator George and Olivia Reed, and was introduced at the beginning of the third season of the show as Vaughn&#x27;s wife, having married him during Sydney&#x27;s two-year absence under the control of The Covenant. Though Lauren reveals early in the season she was trained as a CIA field agent at the Farm, her father, believing the occupation to be too dangerous, used his influence to make sure she did not receive a field rating. Thus, she became an agent of the NSC, serving as its liaison to the CIA and working in the same CIA office with both Sydney Bristow and Michael Vaughn.

Lauren and Sydney have an antagonistic relationship from the start, with Lauren in particular feeling threatened that her husband&#x27;s former lover is now back in his life. Eventually, Sydney and Lauren start co-operating and even go on missions together. Their dynamic briefly falters when Lauren discovers that the murder of a Russian diplomat that she was investigating was committed by Sydney during her two-year absence and Vaughn worked with Sydney&#x27;s associates to conceal the truth; however, when Lauren witnesses Sydney being subjected to brutal interrogation and threatened with a lobotomy, she assists Vaughn, Jack, and Sloane in breaking Sydney out of prison. During this mission, Lauren shoots and kills one of Sydney&#x27;s interrogators, an act which apparently leaves her distraught.

However, it is soon revealed Lauren is actually a double agent for the Covenant, working to sabotage the CIA&#x27;s work against the criminal organization and to gain more information about Sydney through Vaughn. Her first known mission for the Covenant was the assassination of Andrian Lazarey. She is also, contrary to her air of innocence, a cold-blooded killer, yet she also appears to have a soft side since she can&#x27;t bring herself to pull the trigger when tasked to murder her own father when he is given evidence of her true affiliations and to shore up her faltering relationship with Vaughn. It was her mother that stepped in and pulled the trigger herself, revealing she too is an agent of The Covenant.

Lauren is also an adulterer, for not only does she seduce Vaughn and some of her targets, but also becomes involved (both personally and professionally) with Julian Sark, who is also now working for The Covenant. Eventually, her true nature is discovered by the CIA and she becomes a marked woman, with both Sydney and Vaughn wanting to kill her. Lauren then impersonates Sydney with a prosthetic mask to infiltrate the CIA, shoots Marshall Flinkman, and inflicts major damage to the building as well as killing and injuring several agents with remote-triggered bombs before murdering an innocent motorist and stealing his car to escape.

Vaughn becomes obsessed with revenge and is even encouraged by Jack Bristow to kill Lauren. Vaughn eventually captures Lauren, who tells him that she fell in love with him, but then Sydney came back and he didn&#x27;t need her anymore. She also claimed that the Covenant hadn&#x27;t been in contact with her for two years by that point and she thought they&#x27;d leave her with him in peace. Her &#x27;confession&#x27; is ambiguous as she does appear to have developed feelings for Vaughn, as is evident by her reaction to Sark&#x27;s earlier observation that it killed her when Michael dropped his gun, which was trained on her, to save Sydney. Vaughn&#x27;s plans are thwarted by Katya Derevko who helps Lauren escape.

When Sark is captured by the CIA, Lauren is seemingly brought into the cell next to him to arrange his release. After Sark gives her a crucial password, she reveals herself as Sydney, wearing an identical mask to the one the real Lauren had used earlier with a voice modulator.

In the season three finale, Sydney loses to Lauren during vicious hand-to-hand combat, but Lauren is fatally shot by Vaughn before she can kill Sydney. Before her death, she reveals to Sydney the location of a safe deposit box containing vital information about Sydney&#x27;s family. This information turns out to be evidence that Jack Bristow was authorized by the CIA to kill his ex-wife, Sydney&#x27;s mother Irina Derevko, an order he apparently carried out.

In the fourth season episode, &quot;A Man of His Word&quot;, Lauren&#x27;s corpse was shown in a special high-security crypt after Sark demands to see her body. For reasons not yet explained, the CIA determined Lauren&#x27;s death should not be made public knowledge, and the double agent&#x27;s remains are housed in the CIA crypt. Melissa George makes a cameo appearance as the dead woman.

==Casting and creation==
Katherine Heigl auditioned for the role of Lauren Reed but did not get it. Melissa George was working on &quot;Charmed&quot; when J.J. Abrams called to tell her she had landed the part. George had auditioned to play lead character Sydney Bristow, but lost out to Jennifer Garner. When that happened, ABC cast her on &quot;Thieves&quot; instead. It was originally planned that George would guest-star for several episodes but she was quickly upgraded to regular. To explain her character&#x27;s accent (George is Australian), the writers wrote that she was born in the United States but grew up in London.

==Characterization and fan reaction==
At the beginning of the third season, George said of Reed: &quot;I think it would be interesting if we did see Lauren turn evil, because she seems so pleasant, and innocent and lovely, which makes it more exciting if she was evil...&quot; Looking back on her character, George said: &quot;Nobody cared about Lauren Reed, because she had no heart. Zero. There was nothing to like about her. But that was beautiful at the same time, because she was an assassin, after all. I mean, you see Jason Bourne or James Bond or any of the other characters, they kill and they’re vengeful characters, but you don’t hate them. Lauren Reed, though, you hate.&quot;

The character of Lauren Reed received quite a bit of animosity from fans of the show, according to series creator J. J. Abrams, in part because she disrupted the romance between Sydney and Vaughn. However, Abrams indicated that the revelation of Lauren being a turncoat was planned from the beginning and was not because of fan response. George has said that &quot;I got offered a couple of films so I decided to kind&#x27;ve [sic] move on.&quot; George has joked &quot;my character was written out for being too evil&quot;.

Since Lauren died &quot;off screen&quot; there were rumors during the fourth season that the character would return. George herself said &quot;there is talk of me coming back at some point, because obviously in Alias you&#x27;re never written out completely... [but] I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back unless she got some focus.&quot; These rumors were put to rest when Lauren&#x27;s corpse was shown in the ninth episode of season 4. The season 4 gag reel, included in the DVD release of that season, includes footage in which Melissa George as Lauren makes a surprise appearance during a scene, before George breaks character and begins to laugh.

<text>Leila Arab (, born in 1971), professionally known as Leila, is an Iranian-born record producer and DJ based in London, England. She has released music on the labels Rephlex, XL and Warp. She has also worked extensively with Icelandic singer Björk.

==Biography==

Arab was born in Pahlavi Iran and spent part of her childhood there. Her family fled to London following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She became interested in DJing and keyboards, and left college to perform with singer Björk in 1994, later working with her as a sound engineer and live mixer. She met Richard D. James while both were on tour with Björk, and both James and Grant Wilson-Claridge suggested she release her solo recordings on their label Rephlex Records.

In 1998, Leila released her debut album, &quot;Like Weather&quot;, on Rephlex. In 2000, she released &quot;Courtesy of Choice&quot; on XL Recordings. Ben Thompson of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; referred to these releases as &quot;two collections of spooky electronic soul which [...] established her as an integral member of the Nineties&#x27; golden generation of British writer-producers.&quot;

After a hiatus following the death of her parents, she released &quot;Blood Looms and Blooms&quot; in 2008 on Warp. It included vocal contributions from Terry Hall and Martina Topley-Bird. In 2009, she contributed a cover of an Aphex Twin song, &quot;Vordhosbn&quot;, to the &quot;Warp20 (Recreated)&quot; compilation album.

In 2012, she released her fourth LP &quot;U&amp;I&quot; on Warp. In 2015, she released a collaborative EP with Zebra Katz, titled &quot;Nu Renegade&quot;, on ZFK Records.

<text>Mughal-e-Azam () is a 1960 Indian epic historical drama film produced and directed by K. Asif. Starring Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, and Durga Khote, it follows the love affair between Mughal Prince Salim (who went on to become Emperor Jahangir) and Anarkali, a court dancer. Salim&#x27;s father, Emperor Akbar, disapproves of the relationship, which leads to a war between father and son.

The development of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; began in 1944, when Asif read a 1922 play called &quot;Anarkali,&quot; by the playwright Imtiaz Ali Taj, which is set in the reign of Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty. Before its principal photography began in the early 1950s, the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast. &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period. The soundtrack, inspired by Indian classical and folk music, comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singer Lata Mangeshkar along with Mohammed Rafi, Shamshad Begum, and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, and is often cited among the finest in the history of Hindi cinema.

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; had the widest release of any Indian film up to that time, and patrons often queued all day for tickets. Released on 5 August 1960, it broke box office records in India and became the highest-grossing Indian film, a distinction it held for 15 years. The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards at the 8th Filmfare Awards. &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured, and the first in any language to be given a theatrical re-release. The colour version, released on 12 November 2004, was also a commercial success.

The film is widely considered to be a milestone for its genre, earning praise from critics for its grandeur and attention to detail, and the performances of its cast (especially that of Madhubala, who earned a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress). Film scholars have welcomed its portrayal of enduring themes, but question its historical accuracy. It was the most expensive Indian film made until then.

== Plot ==
Emperor Akbar, who does not have a male heir, undertakes a pilgrimage to a shrine to pray that his wife Jodhabai give birth to a son. Later, a maid brings the emperor news of his son&#x27;s birth. Overjoyed at his prayers being answered, Akbar gives the maid his ring and promises to grant her anything she desires.

The son, Prince Salim, grows up to be spoiled, flippant, and self-indulgent. His father sends him off to war, to teach him courage and discipline. Fourteen years later, Salim returns as a distinguished soldier and falls in love with court dancer Nadira, daughter of the maid who brought the emperor news of his son&#x27;s birth. Nadira was renamed by the emperor as Anarkali, meaning pomegranate blossom. The relationship is discovered by the jealous Bahar, a dancer of a higher rank, who wants prince Salim to love her so that she may one day become empress. Unsuccessful in winning Salim&#x27;s love, she exposes his forbidden relationship with Anarkali. Salim pleads to marry Anarkali, but his father refuses and imprisons her. Despite her treatment, Anarkali refuses to reject Salim, as Akbar demands.

Salim rebels and amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is sentenced to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince&#x27;s life and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs to have a few hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment.

As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim&#x27;s birth. Anarkali&#x27;s mother pleads for her daughter&#x27;s life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair live in obscurity and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.

=== Development ===

The Urdu dramatist Imtiaz Ali Taj wrote a play about the love story of Salim and Anarkali in 1922, based more on a 16th-century legend than on fact. A stage version was soon produced, and screen versions followed. Ardeshir Irani made a silent film, &quot;Anarkali&quot;, in 1928, and remade it with sound in 1935. In the early 1940s, the tale of Anarkali inspired producer Shiraz Ali Hakeem and young director K. Asif (Karimuddin Asif) to make another film adaptation which they would title &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;. They recruited four Urdu writers to develop the screenplay and dialogue: Aman (Zeenat Aman&#x27;s father, also known as Amanullah Khan), Wajahat Mirza, Kamaal Amrohi, and Ehsan Rizvi. It is not known how the writers collaborated or shared out their work, but in 2010 &quot;The Times of India&quot; said that their &quot;mastery over Urdu&#x27;s poetic idiom and expression is present in every line, giving the film, with its rich plots and intricate characters, the overtones of a Shakespearean drama.&quot; As the script neared completion, Asif cast Chandra Mohan, D. K. Sapru, and Nargis for the roles of Akbar, Salim, and Anarkali, respectively. Shooting started in 1946 in Bombay Talkies studio.

The project faced multiple hurdles, which forced its temporary abandonment. The political tensions and communal rioting surrounding India&#x27;s 1947 partition and independence stalled production. Shortly after partition, Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan, leaving Asif without a financier. The actor Chandra Mohan suffered a heart attack and died in 1949. Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film. Although Pallonji knew nothing about film production, in 1950 he agreed to finance the film because of his interest in the history of Akbar. Production was then restarted with a new cast.

Believing that the film had been cancelled, Kamal Amrohi, one of the scriptwriters who was also a director, planned to make a film on the same subject himself. When confronted by Asif, he agreed to shelve the project. Another unrelated film production based on the same stage play was Nandlal Jaswantlal&#x27;s &quot;Anarkali&quot;, starring Bina Rai and Pradeep Kumar, which became the highest grossing Hindi film of 1953.

=== Casting ===

Asif had initially rejected Dilip Kumar for the part of Prince Salim. Kumar was reluctant to act in a period film, but accepted the role upon the insistence of the film&#x27;s producer. According to Kumar, &quot;Asif trusted me enough to leave the delineation of Salim completely to me.&quot; Kumar faced difficulty while filming in Rajasthan owing to the heat and the body armour he wore. The part of Anarkali had first been offered to Nutan, who declined it; Suraiya was considered for the role but eventually it went to Madhubala, who had been longing for a significant role. Upon signing the film, Madhubala was advancely paid a sum of 1 lakh, which was the highest for any actor/actress at that time. She suffered from congenital heart disease, which was one of the reasons why at times she fainted on set; she also endured skin abrasions while filming the prison sequences, but was determined to finish the film.

To become the character of Emperor Akbar, Prithviraj Kapoor was reported to have &quot;relied completely on the script and director&quot;. Prior to make-up, Kapoor would declare, &quot;Prithviraj Kapoor ab jaa rahaa hai&quot; (&quot;Prithviraj Kapoor is now going&quot;); after make-up, he would announce, &quot;Akbar ab aa rahaa hai&quot; (&quot;Akbar is now coming&quot;). Kapoor faced difficulty with his heavy costumes, and suffered blisters on his feet after walking barefoot in the desert for a sequence. Lance Dane, a photographer who was on set during the filming, recalled that Kapoor struggled to remember his lines in some scenes; he mentioned one scene in particular that Kapoor required 19 takes to get right. At the time of filming, Kapoor who was on a diet, was told by Asif to regain the lost weight for his portrayal of Akbar. Durga Khote was cast as Akbar&#x27;s wife Jodhabai, and Nigar Sultana as the dancer Bahar. Zakir Hussain, who later became a &quot;tabla&quot; maestro, had initially been considered for the part of the young Prince Salim, but it became the debut role of Jalal Agha, who later performed on the song &quot;Mehbooba Mehbooba&quot; from &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975).

=== Design ===
The production design of the film, led by art director M. K. Syed, was extravagant, and some sets took six weeks to erect. The film, mostly shot in studio sets designed to represent the interior of a Mughal palace, featured opulent furnishings and water features such as fountains and pools, generating the feel of a Hollywood historical epic of the period. The song &quot;Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; was filmed in Mohan Studios on a set built as a replica of the Sheesh Mahal in the Lahore Fort. The set was noted for its size, measuring in length, in breadth and in height. A much-discussed aspect was the presence of numerous small mirrors made of Belgian glass, which were crafted and designed by workers from Firozabad. The set took two years to build and cost more than 1.5 million (valued at about US$314,000 in 1960), more than the budget of an entire Hindi film at the time. The film&#x27;s financiers feared bankruptcy as a result of the high cost of production.

Artisans from across India were recruited to craft the props. The costumes were designed by Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery stitched the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army&#x27;s Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan, wearing full armour.

=== Principal photography ===
Principal photography for &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; began in the early 1950s. Each sequence was reportedly filmed three times, as the film was being produced in Hindi/Urdu, Tamil, and English. The film was eventually dubbed in Tamil and released in 1961 as &quot;Akbar&quot;, but that version&#x27;s commercial failure resulted in the abandonment of the planned English dubbing, for which British actors were considered. Asif was accompanied by an extensive crew, which included his assistant directors S. T. Zaidi, Khalid Akhtar, Surinder Kapoor (assisting primarily for the English version), and five others. Additional crew members included cinematographer R. D. Mathur, choreographer Lachhu Maharaj, production manager Aslam Noori, cameraman M. D. Ayub, editor Dharamavir, makeup artists P. G. Joshi and Abdul Hamid, and sound director Akram Shaikh.

Some film sequences were shot with up to 14 cameras, significantly more than the norm at that time. There were many difficulties with the film&#x27;s lighting; cinematographer Mathur reportedly took eight hours to light a single shot. In total, 500 days of shooting were needed, compared to a normal schedule of 60 to 125 shooting days at the time. Owing to the very large size of the Sheesh Mahal set, the lighting was provided by the headlights of 500 trucks and about 100 reflectors. The presence of the mirrors on the set caused problems, as they sparkled under the lights. Foreign consultants, including British director David Lean, told Asif to forget the idea since they felt that it was impossible to film the scene under the intense glare. Asif confined himself to the set with the lighting crew, and subsequently overcame the problem by covering all the mirrors with a thin layer of wax, thereby subduing their reflectivity. Mathur also used strategically placed strips of cloth to implement &quot;bounce lighting&quot;, which reduced the glare.
A number of problems and production delays were encountered during filming, to the extent that at one point Asif considered abandoning the project. Kumar defended the long duration of filming, invoking the massive logistics of the film and explaining that the entire cast and crew were &quot;acutely conscious of the hard work [they] would have to put in, as well as the responsibility [they] would have to shoulder.&quot;

The production also suffered from financial problems, and Asif exceeded the budget on a number of occasions. The final budget of the film is a subject of debate. Some sources state that &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; cost 10.5 million to produce (about US$2.25 million at the time) while others state that it cost 15 million (about $3 million). This made &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; the most expensive Indian film of the period. A number of estimates put the film&#x27;s inflation-adjusted budget at 500 million to 2 billion. The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji, while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members; differences crept up between Asif and Kumar when the former married the latter&#x27;s sister. Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break-up of Kumar and Madhubala, who had been dating for nine years.

=== Post-production ===
Sohrab Modi&#x27;s &quot;Jhansi Ki Rani&quot; (1953) was the first Indian film to be shot in colour, and by 1957, colour production had become increasingly common. Asif filmed one reel of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, including the song &quot;Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot;, in Technicolor. Impressed by the result, he filmed three more reels in Technicolor, near the story&#x27;s climax. After seeing them, he sought a complete re-shoot in Technicolor, but financiers refused. Asif subsequently released &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; partially coloured, although he still hoped to see the full film in colour.

By the end of filming, more than a million feet of negative had been used, necessitating significant editing. A number of songs were edited out owing to the running time, which in the end was 197 minutes. Almost half of the songs recorded for the film were left out of the final version.

== Themes ==
&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; is a family history highlighting the differences between father and son, duty to the public over family, and the trials and tribulations of women, particularly of courtesans. According to Rachel Dwyer, author of the book &quot;Filming the Gods: Religion and Indian Cinema&quot;, the film highlights religious tolerance between Hindus and Muslims. Examples include the scenes of Hindu Queen Jodhabai&#x27;s presence in the court of the Muslim Akbar, the singing of a Hindu devotional song by Anarkali, and Akbar&#x27;s participation in the Janmashtami celebrations, during which Akbar is shown pulling a string to rock a swing with an idol of Krishna on it. Film critic Mukul Kesavan has remarked that he was unable to recall a single other film about Hindu-Muslim love in which the woman (Jodhabai) is Hindu. Scholars Bhaskar and Allen described the film as a &quot;tableau vivant&quot; of &quot;Islamicate culture&quot;, evidenced in its ornate sets, musical sequences such as the &quot;qawwali&quot; scene, and chaste Urdu dialogues. Throughout the film there is a distinct depiction of Muslims as the ruling class who not only dressed differently but also spoke in complex Persianised dialogue. They are made to appear &quot;distinct and separate from the mainstream.&quot;

Film scholar Stephen Teo posits that &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; is a &quot;national allegory&quot;, a stylistic way of appropriating history and heritage to emphasise the national identity. He believes the arrogance of Bahar represents the power of the state and that Anarkali&#x27;s emotion, which is highly personal, represents the private individual. Teo states that the theme of romantic love defeating social class difference and power hierarchy, as well as the grandeur of the filming, contribute to the film&#x27;s attractiveness. Author Ashis Nandy has commented on the poetic quality of the dialogue, saying that &quot;the characters of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; do not just speak – they refine communication, they distil it, they crystallize it into many faceted glittering gems, they make poetry of ordinary language.&quot; Gowri Ramnarayan of &quot;The Hindu&quot; has also emphasised the power of the dialogues in the film, in that they &quot;create not only the ambiance of this period drama, but also etch character and situation. Every syllable breathes power and emotion.&quot;

Philip Lutgendorf, a scholar at the University of Iowa, has stated that while the theme of the conflict between passionate individual love and family duty may be very common in Hindi film making, with endless cinematic permutations, K. Asif&#x27;s &quot;excessive elaboration of the theme remains in a class by itself.&quot; Further, Emperor Akbar struggles between his personal desires and his duties to the nation. Ashis Nandy noted that apart from the conflict between Akbar and his son, there is also an &quot;unwritten alliance&quot; between Akbar and Bahar that compounds the problems of Anarkali. He also thought it highlighted the &quot;idea of justice and the notion of unconditional love&quot; to uphold tradition. The song &quot;Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; sung by Anarkali was an indication of her defiance of societal norms. A major difference from the original story is that while the earlier Anarakali films based on Imtiaz Ali Taj&#x27;s story ended as tragedies, K. Asif created a relatively happy ending in that Akbar gives amnesty to Anarkali by allowing her to escape through a secret route of tunnels below a false bottom of her prison wall, although his son is made to suffer in believing her to have perished.

== Historical inaccuracies ==

The film is based on a legend, but it is given credence by at least two texts that assert Anarkali&#x27;s existence during the historical period of Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). One of the books states that in 1615 a marble tomb was built on Anarkali&#x27;s grave in Lahore by Salim, when he had become Emperor Jehangir. On the tomb is a Persian inscription that reads: &quot;Ta Kiyamat shukr geom kardgate khwesh ra, Aah garman bez benaam roo-e yare khwesh ra&quot; (&quot;Ah! could I behold the face of my love once more, I would give thanks to my God until the day of resurrection&quot;). The author of the stage play on which the film is based, Imtiaz Ali Taj, believed that the legend had no historical base, but historians have suggested that Anarkali may have been a painter, a dancer, or a courtesan, or one of Akbar&#x27;s wives and the mother of Salim&#x27;s half-brother Prince Daniyal. While an earlier film version of the story, &quot;Anarkali&quot; (1952), contained a disclaimer stating that the story had no foundation in history, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; made no such claim.

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; takes numerous liberties with historical fact. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann says that although the real Salim was a heavy consumer of alcohol and opium from the age of 18, he was not necessarily a mischievous boy, as depicted in the film. When the film&#x27;s Salim returns from his time in the military, he is depicted as a gentle and romantic hero, in contrast to the real Salim, who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death. The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father, tried to replace him as emperor, and had Akbar&#x27;s friend Abu al-Fazl murdered in 1602, but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali, which is historically inaccurate. Further, there were also discrepancies in sets, costumes, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, actually the royal bath of the queen, was depicted in the film as a dancing hall, and much larger. Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were depicted, although the story takes place in the 16th century. For example, &quot;thumri&quot;, a semi-classical music form developed in the 19th century, is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style, which is a 16th-century dance form.

== Music ==
The soundtrack was composed by music director Naushad, and the lyrics were written by Shakeel Badayuni. After conceiving the idea of the film, Asif visited Naushad and handed him a briefcase containing money, telling him to make &quot;memorable music&quot; for &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;. Offended by the explicit notion of money as a means of gaining quality, Naushad threw the notes out of the window, to the surprise of his wife. She subsequently made peace between the two men, and Asif apologised. With this, Naushad accepted the offer to compose the film&#x27;s soundtrack.
As with most of Naushad&#x27;s soundtracks, the songs of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; were heavily inspired by Indian classical music and folk music, particularly &quot;ragas&quot; such as &quot;Darbari&quot;, &quot;Durga&quot;, used in the composition of &quot;Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot;, and &quot;Kedar&quot;, used in &quot;Bekas Pe Karam Keejeye&quot;. He also made extensive use of western classical orchestras and choruses to add grandeur to the music. The soundtrack contained a total of 12 songs, which were rendered by playback singers and classical music artists. These songs account for nearly one third of the film&#x27;s running time.

== Marketing ==
The painter G. Kamble was lured away from V. Shantaram&#x27;s Rajkamal Kalamandir to paint the posters. Kamble also created cinema displays at Maratha Mandir theatre. Asif needed to buy all available stocks of Winsor &amp; Newton paint in India at a cost of 6 lakh to enable Kamble to produce quality art for his hoardings. Kamble, who was offered a large sum of 8 lakh for his work on the stills of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, did not receive any compensation in the end due to fraud.

== Release ==

At the time of the release of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, a typical Hindi film would garner a distribution fee of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the distributors at no less than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold at a price of 1.7 million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Hindi film at that time.

The premiere of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was held at the then-new 1,100-capacity Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai. Mirroring the nature of the film, the cinema&#x27;s foyer had been decorated to resemble a Mughal palace, and a cut-out of Prithviraj Kapoor was erected outside it. The Sheesh Mahal set was transported from the studio to the cinema, where ticket holders could go inside and experience its grandeur. Invitations to the premiere were sent as &quot;royal invites&quot; shaped like scrolls, which were written in Urdu and made to look like the &quot;Akbarnama&quot;, the official chronicle of the reign of Akbar. The premiere was held amidst great fanfare, with large crowds and an extensive media presence, in addition to hosting much of the film industry, although Dilip Kumar did not attend the event owing to his dispute with Asif. The film&#x27;s reels arrived at the premiere cinema atop a decorated elephant, accompanied by the music of bugles and &quot;shehnai&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The day before bookings for the film opened, a reported crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir to buy tickets. The tickets, the most expensive for a Hindi film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector&#x27;s items. They sold for 100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960), compared to the usual price of 1.5 (US$0.31). Bookings experienced major chaos, to the extent that police intervention was required. It was reported that people would wait in queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through their family members. Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks.

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was released on 5 August 1960 in 150 cinemas across the country, establishing a record for the widest release for a Hindi film. It became a major commercial success, earning 4 million (US$839,000) in the first week, eventually earning a net revenue of 55 million (US$11,530,000), and generating a profit of 30 million for the producers. &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; also experienced a long theatrical run, screening to full capacity at the Maratha Mandir for three years. The film thus became the highest-grossing Hindi film by surpassing &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), and retained this record until &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975) surpassed its net revenue. In terms of gross revenue, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; earned ().

According to Ziya Us Salam of &quot;The Hindu&quot; in 2009, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time if adjusted for inflation. According to the online box office website Box Office India in January 2008, the film&#x27;s adjusted net revenue would have amounted to , ranking it as an &quot;All-Time Blockbuster&quot;. According to Box Office India in June 2017, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; may have had more than 100 million footfalls at the domestic box office more than films like &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun&quot; (1994) and &quot;Baahubali 2&quot; (2017). According to financial newspaper &quot;Mint&quot;, the adjusted net income of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; is equivalent to () in 2017. In 2011, it was ranked as the highest grossing Hindi film by a distance, when adjusted to gold-price inflation by Box Office India with adjusted nett gross of ₹1234.95 crore. The list was compiled using the relative price of gold in different years to arrive at a hypothetical current value of box-office collections of past films, which as per the trade magazine was a more appropriate measure of comparison as compared to official ticket-price inflation rates.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; received universal acclaim from Indian critics; every aspect of the film was praised. A review dated 26 August 1960 in &quot;Filmfare&quot; called it a &quot;history-making film ... the work of a team of creative artists drawn from different spheres of the art world&quot;. It was also described as &quot;a tribute to imagination, hard work and lavishness of its maker, Mr. Asif. For its grandeur, its beauty, and then performances of the artists it should be a landmark in Indian films.&quot; Another contemporary review from &quot;The Indian Express&quot; focused on the acting and dancing &quot;gifts&quot; of Madhubala.

Since 2000, reviewers have described the film as a &quot;classic&quot;, &quot;benchmark&quot;, or &quot;milestone&quot; in the history of Indian cinema. In 2011, Anupama Chopra called it &quot;the best Hindi film ever made&quot; and &quot;the apotheosis of the Hindi film form&quot;, noting specifically the performances, father-son drama and song sequences. Dinesh Raheja of Rediff called the film a must-see classic, saying &quot;a work of art is the only phrase to describe this historical whose grand palaces-and-fountains look has an epic sweep and whose heart-wrenching core of romance has the tenderness of a feather&#x27;s touch.&quot; Sujata Gupta of &quot;Planet Bollywood&quot; gave the film nine out of ten stars, calling it a &quot;must see&quot; that &quot;has captured interest of people over generations&quot;.

K. K. Rai, in his review for &quot;Stardust&quot; stated, &quot;it can be said that the grandeur and vintage character of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; cannot be repeated, and it will remembered as one of the most significant films made in this country.&quot; Ziya Us Salam of &quot;The Hindu&quot; described &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; as a film people will want to watch over and over again. Raja Sen of Rediff compared the film to &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960) and said, &quot;&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; is awesomely, stunningly overwhelming, a magnificent spectacle entirely free of CGI and nonlinear gimmickry, a gargantuan feat of ... of ... well, of Mughal proportions!&quot; Laura Bushell of the BBC rated the film four out of five stars, considering it to be a &quot;benchmark film for both Indian cinema and cinema grandeur in general&quot;, and remarking that &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot; was an epic film in every way. Naman Ramachandran, reviewing the film for the British Film Institute, noted the depiction of religious tolerance and said the film had a tender heart.

Nasreen Munni Kabir, author of &quot;The Immortal Dialogue of K. Asif&#x27;s Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, compared the film to the Koh-i-Noor diamond for its enduring worth to Indian cinema. &quot;Outlook&quot;, in 2008, and &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, in 2011, both declared that the scene in which Salim brushes Anarkali with an ostrich feather was the most erotic and sensuous scene in the history of Indian cinema.

=== Accolades ===
At the 1961 National Film Awards, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. In the 1961 Filmfare Awards, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was nominated in seven categories: Best Film, Best Director (Asif), Best Actress (Madhubala), Best Playback Singer (Mangeshkar), Best Music (Naushad), Best Cinematography (Mathur), and Best Dialogue (Aman, Wajahat Mirza, Kamaal Amrohi, and Ehsan Rizvi), winning the awards for Best Film, Best Cinematography, and Best Dialogue.

== Colourisation ==

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured and the first to be given a theatrical re-release. The Sterling Investment Corporation, the negative rights owner and an arm of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, undertook restoration and colourisation of &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; and assigned Deepesh Salgia as Project Designer and Director. They initially approached Hollywood executives for help, but found the sales quotations, ranging from $12–15 million, too high. In 2002, Umar Siddiqui, managing director of the Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA), proposed to enhance it digitally at a fraction of the cost. To convince the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, one of India&#x27;s wealthiest companies, of the commercial viability of the project, the IAAA colourised a four-minute clip and showed it to them. They approved and gave the project the go-ahead. Shapoorji Mistry, grandson of producer Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry, thought it a fitting tribute to complete his grandfather&#x27;s unfinished dream of colourising the entire film.

The first step towards colourisation was the restoration of the original negatives, which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing of the negative during the original theatrical release. Costly and labour-intensive restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out. The negative was cleaned of fungal growth, damaged portions were restored, and missing parts of frames were re-instated. After cleaning, each of the 300,000 frames of the negative was scanned into a 10 megabytes-sized file and then was digitally restored. The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab, Chennai. The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation, which necessitated having the sound cleaned at Chace Studio in the United States. The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh. For the songs, the original voices of the singers like Lata Mangeshkar, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Mohammed Rafi were extracted from the original mixed track and the same were recreated with re-recorded score in 6.1 surround sound.

The process of colourisation was preceded by extensive research. The art departments visited museums and studied the literature for background on the typical colours of clothing worn at that time. Siddiqui studied the technology used for the colourisation of black-and-white Hollywood classics. The team also approached a number of experts for guidance and suggestions, including Dilip Kumar, production designer Nitin Chandrakant Desai, and a historian from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. To undertake the colourisation, Siddiqui brought together a team of around 100 individuals, including computer engineers and software professionals, and organised a number of art departments. The entire project was co-ordinated by Deepesh Salgia, who partnered with companies including Iris Interactive and Rajtaru Studios to execute the colourisation. The task was controlled and supervised by the producers, who received daily updates and progress reports.

The colourisation team spent 18 months developing software for colouring the frames, called &quot;Effects Plus&quot;, which was designed to accept only those colours whose hue would match the shade of grey present in the original film. This ensured that the colours added were as close to the real colour as possible; the authenticity of the colouring was later verified when a costume used in the film was retrieved from a warehouse, and its colours were found to closely match those in the film. Every shot was finally hand-corrected to perfect the look. The actual colourisation process took a further 10 months to complete. Siddiqui said that it had &quot;been a painstaking process with men working round the clock to complete the project.&quot; The exact cost of the colourisation is disputed, with a wide variety of estimates ranging from to 50 million, or 100 million.

== Re-releases ==
The film&#x27;s colour version was released theatrically on 12 November 2004, in 150 prints across India, 65 of which were in Maharashtra. The new release premiered at the Eros Cinema in Mumbai. Dilip Kumar, who had not attended the original premiere, was in attendance. The colour version was edited to a running time of 177 minutes, as compared to the original version&#x27;s 197 minutes. The new release also included a digital reworked soundtrack, produced with the assistance of Naushad, the original composer. The release on the festive Diwali weekend came with three other major releases: &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;, &quot;Aitraaz&quot;, and &quot;Naach&quot;. It became the 19th highest grossing Hindi film of the year, behind &quot;Aitraaz&quot; and &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (the top grosser), but ahead of &quot;Naach&quot;.

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; became the first full-length feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals, including the 55th Berlin International Film Festival. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were &quot;psychedelic&quot; or &quot;unnatural&quot;, others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that while colourising was not a good idea for most black-and-white classics, it was perfect in this particular instance. He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that although the new version was an improvement, &quot;the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur&#x27;s elegantly composed shots.&quot; The BBC&#x27;s Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was &quot;restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound&quot;, considered it a &quot;cross between &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;&quot;. Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version.

In 2006, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; became only the fourth Indian film certified for showing in Pakistan since the 1965 ban on Indian cinema, and was released with a premiere in Lahore. It was distributed by Nadeem Mandviwala Entertainment, at the request of Asif&#x27;s son, Akbar Asif.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; is one of only two films directed by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Hindi film vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as &quot;Black&quot; (2005) and &quot;Saawariya&quot; (2007), said that he and others in his field look to &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used as a model for the perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013 cited &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; as a &quot;landmark of cinema&quot; despite its historical inaccuracies, and the BBC stated in 2005 that it is &quot;widely considered one of Bollywood&#x27;s most iconic films&quot;. Imtiaz Ali of &quot;The Times of India&quot; in 2010 called it the &quot;most proto-typical, high involvement, expensive, passionate piece of work that Hindi cinema has ever produced&quot;, one that &quot;set the standard for everything that will ever come after it&quot;. It continues to be regarded by critics as the Indian equivalent of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Filmmaker Subhash Ghai was quoted in 2010 as saying that a film like this could never be repeated: &quot;&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; is an all-time classic and has been the ultimate love story in Hindi cinema at all levels. So it will always remain alive for generations to come.&quot; To commemorate the film&#x27;s anniversary, the actor and producer Shah Rukh Khan had his company Red Chillies Entertainment produce a documentary video titled &quot;Mughal-E-Azam – A Tribute by a son to his father&quot;. Hosted by Khan, it includes interviews with Asif&#x27;s family and Hindi film stars. Artist M. F. Husain created a series of paintings for the video, in which he re-imagined some memorable scenes. Interested in preserving the film for future generations, Khan noted that his father was originally cast in the film but did not complete it. When asked if &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; should be remade, he retorted: &quot;It is the mother of all films; mothers cannot be remade&quot;. No sequels have been made, but &quot;Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (2008) paid tribute with its title and by including in its plot part of the original stage play; it received very poor ratings from critics. In October 2016, producer Feroz Abbas Khan premiered a &quot;stage play&quot; based on the film with a cast of over 70 actors and dancers at Mumbai&#x27;s NCPA theatre.

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; ranks on the lists of top Indian films, including the 2002 British Film Institute poll of Top 10 Indian Films, and Anupama Chopra&#x27;s 2009 list The Best Bollywood Films. It is also included in IBN Live&#x27;s 2013 list of the &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes has sampled 10 reviewers and judged 91% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 7.9 out of 10. It was named the greatest Bollywood film of all time by a poll celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema by British Asian weekly newspaper &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; in July 2013. It belongs to a small collection of films including &quot;Kismet&quot; (1943), &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), and &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994), that are watched repeatedly throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films of cultural significance. Books and documentaries made about the film include Shakil Warsi&#x27;s &quot;Mughal-E-Azam – An Epic of Eternal Love&quot;, published by Rupa in 2009.

<doc id="518118" wikidata="Q7449310" url="?curid=518118" title="Semi-locally simply connected">
<text>In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, semi-locally simply connected is a certain local connectedness condition that arises in the theory of covering spaces. Roughly speaking, a topological space &quot;X&quot; is semi-locally simply connected if there is a lower bound on the sizes of the “holes” in &quot;X&quot;. This condition is necessary for most of the theory of covering spaces, including the existence of a universal cover and the Galois correspondence between covering spaces and subgroups of the fundamental group.

Most “nice” spaces such as manifolds and CW complexes are semi-locally simply connected, and topological spaces that do not satisfy this condition are considered somewhat pathological. The standard example of a non-semi-locally simply connected space is the Hawaiian earring.

==Definition==
A space &quot;X&quot; is called semi-locally simply connected if every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; and every neighborhood &quot;V&quot; of &quot;x&quot; has an open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that formula_1 with the property that every loop in &quot;U&quot; can be contracted to a single point within &quot;X&quot; (i.e. every loop in &quot;U&quot; is nullhomotopic in &quot;X&quot;). The neighborhood &quot;U&quot; need not be simply connected: though every loop in &quot;U&quot; must be contractible within &quot;X&quot;, the contraction is not required to take place inside of &quot;U&quot;. For this reason, a space can be semi-locally simply connected without being locally simply connected.
Equivalent to this definition, a space &quot;X&quot; is called semi-locally simply connected if every point in &quot;X&quot; has a open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; with the property that every loop in &quot;U&quot; can be contracted to a single point within &quot;X&quot; .

Another equivalent way to define this concept is the following, a space &quot;X&quot; is semi-locally simply connected if every point in &quot;X&quot; has an open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; for which the homomorphism from the fundamental group of U to the fundamental group of &quot;X&quot;, induced by the inclusion map of &quot;U&quot; into &quot;X&quot;, is trivial.

Most of the main theorems about covering spaces, including the existence of a universal cover and the Galois correspondence, require a space to be path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, a condition known as unloopable (&quot;délaçable&quot; in French). In particular, this condition is necessary for a space to have a simply connected covering space.

==Examples==
A simple example of a space that is not semi-locally simply connected is the Hawaiian earring: the union of the circles in the Euclidean plane with centers (1/&quot;n&quot;, 0) and radii 1/&quot;n&quot;, for &quot;n&quot; a natural number. Give this space the subspace topology. Then all neighborhoods of the origin contain circles that are not nullhomotopic.

The Hawaiian earring can also be used to construct a semi-locally simply connected space that is not locally simply connected. In particular, the cone on the Hawaiian earring is contractible and therefore semi-locally simply connected, but it is clearly not locally simply connected.

==Topology of fundamental group==
In terms of the natural topology on the fundamental group, a locally path-connected space is semi-locally simply connected if and only if its quasitopological fundamental group is discrete.

<doc id="518119" wikidata="Q992216" url="?curid=518119" title="Fratricide">
<text>Fratricide (; – the assimilated root of &#x27;to kill, cut down&#x27;) is the act of killing one&#x27;s own brother.

It can either be done directly or via the use of either a hired or an indoctrinated intermediary (an assassin). The victim need not be the perpetrator&#x27;s biological brother. In a military context, fratricide refers to a service member killing a comrade.

The term is often used metaphorically to refer to civil wars.

== Religion and mythology ==
The Abrahamic religions recognize the biblical account of Cain and Abel as the first fratricidal murder to be committed. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the city is founded as the result of a fratricide, with the twins Romulus and Remus quarreling over who has the favour of the gods and over each other&#x27;s plans to build Rome, with Romulus becoming Rome&#x27;s first king and namesake after killing his brother.

In Greek mythology, Cassiphone, the daughter of Odysseus and Circe, killed her half-brother and husband Telemachus in revenge after he killed her mother Circe following a quarrell between the two.

=== Osiris Myth ===

In ancient Egyptian mythology, the god Osiris is murdered by his brother Set who usurps the throne.

===The Mahabharata and the Ramayana===
In the Hindu epic Mahābhārata, Karna was killed by Arjuna who was unaware that Karna was his eldest brother.

==Roman Empire==

The only known fratricides in the Roman Empire are Romulus killing Remus and the reasonably well-known murder of Geta on the orders of his brother Caracalla in 211. The brothers had a fraught relationship enduring many years; upon their father Septimius Severus&#x27;s death in February 211, they succeeded him as co-emperors. Their joint rule was embittered and unsuccessful, with each of them conspiring to have the other one murdered. In December of that year, Caracalla pretended to be holding a reconciliation in their mother Julia Domna&#x27;s apartment when Geta was lured to come unarmed and unguarded. A group of Centurions loyal to Caracalla ambushed him upon Geta&#x27;s arrival, with Geta dying in his mother&#x27;s arms. It is said that the fratricide would often come back to haunt Caracalla.

==Persian Empire==
There are many recorded fratricides in Persia, the most famous of which involving Cyrus the Great&#x27;s sons Cambyses II and Bardiya, the former killing the latter. There are also stories about the sons of Artaxerxes I, Xerxes II, Sogdianus, and Darius II, all of which concern competition for the throne. In addition, there were many fratricides recorded during the Parthian and Sassanid Empires.

== Tang Empire ==

Prince Li Shimin (Prince of Qin), the second son of Emperor Gaozu, was in an intense rivalry with his elder brother Crown Prince Li Jiancheng and younger brother Prince Li Yuanji (Prince of Qi). He took control and set up an ambush at Xuanwu Gate, the northern gate leading to the Palace City of the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an. There, Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were murdered by Li Shimin and his men. Within three days after the coup, Li Shimin was installed as the crown prince. Emperor Gaozu abdicated another sixty days later and passed the throne to Li Shimin, who would become known as Emperor Taizong.

==Ottoman Empire==
Fratricide was not originally legal in the Ottoman Empire. The practice of fratricide was legalized by Mehmed II. His grandfather, Mehmed I, struggled over the throne with his brothers Süleyman, İsa, and Musa during the Ottoman Interregnum. This civil war lasted eight years and weakened the empire due to the casualties it inflicted and the division it sowed in Ottoman society. As a result, Mehmed II formally legalized the practice of fratricide in order to preserve the state and not further place strain on the unity as previous civil wars did. Mehmed II stated, &quot;Of any of my sons that ascends the throne, it is acceptable for him to kill his brothers for the common benefit of the people (&quot;nizam-i alem&quot;). The majority of the &quot;ulama&quot; (Muslim scholars) have approved this; let action be taken accordingly.&quot;

When Mehmed&#x27;s son, Bayezid II died, his son Selim I immediately assumed the throne and proceeded to execute his two brothers Ahmed and Korkut. The largest practice of fratricide was committed by Mehmed III when he had 19 of his brothers murdered and buried alongside their father. His successor Ahmed I, when faced with public disapproval for the practice of fratricide, decided to outlaw the practice and replace it with seniority ascension system along with imprisonment in the Kafes of any prince who would be a possible threat to the throne.

== Mughal Empire ==
In the Mughal Empire, fratricides often occurred as a result of wars of succession. Shah Jahan had his eldest brother Khusrau Mirza killed in 1622. Shah Jahan also had his brother Shahriyar killed in 1628. Shah Jahan&#x27;s son, Dara Shikoh was assassinated by four of his brother Aurangzeb&#x27;s henchmen in front of his terrified son on the night of 30 August 1659 (9 September Gregorian).

==Antigone==
The events in the Greek tragedy Antigone unfold due to the previous war between the princely brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, who killed each other in combat. Polyneices had challenged his brother&#x27;s claim to the throne of the city Thebes, and attacked the city with an army from Argos. Eteocles fought for Thebes to defend the city against Polyneices and his army. The two killed each other by stabbing in the heart.

==Ashoka&#x27;s Empire==
Ashoka, also known as Chand-Ashoka (Cruel Ashoka), killed his brothers as punishment for the king&#x27;s (his father) death and quarrel for the kingdom (war of succession). Later on, Ashoka conquered Greater India entire, before he adopted Buddhism and forsook war.

==Zulu Kingdom==
Shaka, the Zulu king, was killed by his half-brother Dingane and his brother Mhlangana in 1828. Dingane became the Zulu leader until he was assassinated in 1840 in the Hlatikhulu Forest.

== 21st century ==
In 2008, Erin Caffey planned the murder of her younger brothers and mother in the Caffey family murders. In 2015, Robert and Michael Bever murdered two younger brothers in the Broken Arrow murders.

<doc id="518121" wikidata="Q7971367" url="?curid=518121" title="Church of Saint George, Lalibela">
<text>The Church of Saint George () is one of eleven rock-hewn monolithic churches in Lalibela, a town in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Originally named &quot;Roha&quot; (&quot;Warwar&quot;), the historical and religious site was named Lalibela after the King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela of the Zagwe dynasty, who commissioned its construction. He is regarded as a saint by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

==History==
The Church of Saint George was carved downwards from a type of volcanic tuff. This is the sole architectural material that was used in the structure. It has been dated to the late 12th or early 13th century AD, and thought to have been constructed during the reign of King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, of the late Zagwe dynasty. It is among the best known and last built of the eleven churches in the Lalibela area, and has been referred to as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;. Lalibela, King of Ethiopia, sought to recreate Jerusalem, and structured the churches&#x27; landscape and religious sites in such a way as to achieve such a feat. “The churches at Lalibela are clustered in two major groups, one representing the earthly Jerusalem, and the other representing the heavenly Jerusalem. Located directly between them is a trench representing the River Jordan”. The dimensions of the trench are 25 meters by 25 meters by 30 meters, and there is a small baptismal pool outside the church, which stands in an artificial trench.

According to Ethiopian cultural history, &quot;Betä Giyorgis&quot; was built after King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela of the Zagwe dynasty had a vision in which he was instructed to construct the church; Saint George and God have both been referred to as the one who gave him the instructions.

Lalibela is a pilgrimage site for members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church; the church itself is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela&quot;.

On first approach the site appears wholly inaccessible, with sheer drops on every side and no access bridge. It is accessed via a very narrow man-made canyon, spiralling downwards, which changes to a tunnel close to the church, to further conceal its presence.

Pilgrims who died after reaching the site are placed in a simple open tomb on the outer walls.

The hollowed interior contains a simple shrine to St. George and, behind a curtain (forbidden to view apart from priests) lies a replica of the Ark of the Covenant.

Betä Giyorgis was spatially documented in 2005.

<text>Barbury Castle is a scheduled hillfort in Wiltshire, England. It is one of several such forts found along the ancient Ridgeway route. The site, which lies within the Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, has been managed as a country park by Swindon Borough Council since 1971. It is on Barbury Hill, a local vantage point, which, under ideal weather conditions, commands a view across to the Cotswolds and the River Severn. It has two deep defensive ditches and ramparts.

==History==
The site was first occupied some 2,500 years ago, and was then in use during the Roman occupation of the area. Archaeological investigations at Barbury have shown evidence of a number of buildings, indicating a village or military garrison at this time.

In the 6th century the site became part of the Saxon kingdom of Wessex, following the defeat of the Romano-British at the Battle of Beranburgh, &quot;Beran Byrig&quot; or &quot;Beranbyrig&quot; in AD 556. Centuries later the area was a favourite haunt of the 19th-century writer Richard Jefferies, who lived an hour&#x27;s walk away at Coate. The site was designated as a scheduled monument in 1882.

In World War II the War Ministry appropriated the site for US Army Air Force anti-aircraft guns; the bases for these are apparently visible as hollows around the edge of the fort interior.

In 1996, a geophysical survey revealed traces of 40 hut circles inside the castle. A reconstruction of an Iron Age roundhouse was built on the site in 2006 but was destroyed by vandals in October 2008.

In 2009, English Heritage (now Historic England) carried out a National Mapping Programme project which comprised an interpretation, transcription and analysis of all archaeological features visible on aerial photographs in the environs of Barbury Castle.

== Location ==
Barbury Castle is at , about south of Swindon and the M4, on the northern edge of the Marlborough Downs within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The site is close to the Ridgeway long-distance footpath, which runs east–west along the edge of the downs. In the surrounding area there are round barrows, Celtic field systems and 18th-19th century flint workings.

<doc id="518127" wikidata="Q4996904" url="?curid=518127" title="Bulli, New South Wales">
<text>Bulli ( ) is a northern suburb of Wollongong situated on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia.

==History==

Bulli is possibly derived from an Aboriginal word signifying &quot;double or two mountains&quot;, but other derivations have been suggested.

Captain James Cook sailed up the east coast on 29 April 1770. He attempted to land in the Illawarra, but was forced to return to his ship because of the heavy surf that was running at the time. Of the area around Bulli, Joseph Banks, the ship&#x27;s botanist, was to write: &quot;The country today again made in slopes to the sea.&quot;

Originally inhabited by Dharawal Aboriginal people, European wood cutters worked in the area from about 1815. The area was once abundant in Red Cedars, these are now still seen but thinly. The first permanent European settler was Cornelius O&#x27;Brien, who established a farm in 1823 and whose name was given in the pass at O&#x27;Briens Road south at Figtree.

Bulli soil is also the primary source of soil and foundation of Sydney Cricket Ground, which makes the SCG being seen traditionally as one of the most spin-friendly international cricket grounds in Australia.

===Coal===
The Bulli Coal Company opened a mine in 1862 on the escarpment and built cottages to house miners and their families. Coal was transported by rail from the mine to Bulli Jetty at Sandon Point where it was loaded onto ships.

The miners were paid in accordance with production, they were not paid a set wage. The first trade union in the Illawarra region was formed by miners at Bulli in 1879. Management retaliated by firing and evicting union miners and hiring non-union labour.

On 23 March 1887, a gas explosion in the mine killed 81 men and boys, leaving 50 women widows and 150 children without fathers. There was one survivor, a 17-year-old boy who became known as &quot;Boy Cope&quot;. A memorial obelisk listing the names of those who perished is situated in Park Road, Bulli, adjacent to the railway line. The mine reopened later in the year. The Bulli Mine Disaster was the worst in Australia&#x27;s history until surpassed in 1902 by Mount Kembla.

The disaster was first examined by a coroner&#x27;s inquest. The verdict was delivered by the jury as: &quot;Yes the Jury are of the opinion that William Wade and others came to their death in the Bulli Coalmine on 23rd or March 1887 by a gas explosion&quot;. The jury then added a rider: &quot;which was brought about by the disregard of the Bulli Colliery Special Rules and Coal Mines Act, in allowing men to work when gas existed&quot;. Following the coroner&#x27;s inquest a royal commission was established under the chairmanship of Dr. James R. M. Robertson to inquire into the accident.

Air entering the mine was divided into two. One part went to the western district, the other continued down the main tunnel and supplied the Hill End district which was where the explosion occurred. Within the Hill End District the air passed through each of six headings in turn before being ejected by a furnace at the foot of an upcast shaft. Clearly this meant that any firedamp (usually methane) released by the earlier headings was drawn across the later headings where the men were working. Along each heading were the areas where men extracted the coal. They were known as &quot;bords&quot;. When a bord had been worked out it was simply sealed off, but this meant that any firedamp accumulating there was not promptly removed. Each tunnel was used for three purposes: as a travelling road (for access to parts of the mine), as a haulage road (for bringing coal out) and as a ventilation passage. To control the ventilation &quot;doors&quot; were used, but they had to be opened for the passage of trains of skips. Each opening disrupted the air currents throughout that section of the mine.

The mine has since long been levelled, with only concrete foundations revealing the location of the old office area and other buildings. Hidden along the cliff behind said foundations can be found the old mine entrances. These have been sealed with up to 12 feet of concrete, with a drainage line set in the concrete. To the east is the remnants of the sorting site, a few scattered foundations and a tar patch.

The old railway line from the mine to the coast has mostly been removed, but as you drive south into Bulli you will see the bridge it was set in, now used as a walkway over the highway after a fatal car accident involving a school child saw it restored. This bridge now features a welcome sign for the historic &#x27;black diamond&#x27; district.

==Demographics==
According to the of Population, there were 6,798 people in Bulli.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.8% of the population. 
* 82.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.1%. 
* 90.6% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 47.4%, Catholic 22.2% and Anglican 14.5%.

==Education==

There are two public primary schools named: Bulli Public School and Waniora Public School. There is also one private primary school named St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Parish Primary and one public high school in Bulli High School.

==Landmarks==

Bulli Beach (pictured below) is a popular surfing spot. The northern tip (Sandon Point) is a venue for regular surfing competitions.

Bulli&#x27;s main historical feature is the railway station, situated between the escarpment and the surf beaches. The station was the first on the south coast and contains a museum which is open every Sunday.

The Bulli Methodist Chapel was opened in the year 1865 at the cnr of Point Street and the Prince’s Highway. It became the Bulli Uniting Church in 1977.

Another historic feature is the Heritage Hotel, which was opened in 1889. This is in the heart of the &#x27;Black Diamond&#x27; district.

The Illawarra Grevillea Park is an arboretum and botanic garden which opened in 1993. It houses the repository or living collection of the Grevillea Study Group of the Australian Plants Society (previously SGAP). It is a botanic garden containing plants native to Australia – its collections include grevilleas, prostantheras and rainforest plants. Staffed and run by volunteers, it is open 6 weekends a year.

Behind the Illawarra Grevillea Park is Slacky Flat Park which is home to some reasonably undisturbed remnant rainforest and numerous species of native birds and marsupials.

The town has a small chain of commerce in its central district west of the station, and includes a newsagent and several specialty stores. The town is home to St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School (current principal Mrs Luisa Tobin), Bulli Public School, Waniora Public School and Bulli High School, New South Wales.

At Sandon Point and Tramway Creek immediately north of the promontory, there is some remnant bushland including turpentine forest. This is an important migratory bird location and a history walk has been set up along the road were the old railway used to go. This point is also the site of a midden area. For over fifteen years the local community has been campaigning against residential development of this coastal floodplain and wetland. This included over 150 submissions to a Commission of Inquiry which recommended against further major development. Minister for Planning, Frank Sartor, however has overridden his COI to give Stockland and the Anglican Village Retirement Trust approval to add over 1000 residential houses and units.

<text>Railroad police or railway police are people responsible for the protection of railroad (or railway) properties, facilities, revenue, equipment (train cars and locomotives), and personnel, as well as carried passengers and cargo. Railroad police may also patrol public rail transit systems. 

Their exact roles differ from country to country. In some countries, the powers of railroad police are no different from any other sworn law enforcement officer, while in others they are more like security guards. Some are also given extensive additional authority, while those in other jurisdictions are more restricted. In the United States and Canada, railroad police are employed by the major Class I railroads, as well as some smaller ones. In other countries, this work is typically done by territorial police forces rather than specialized agencies. In the United Kingdom, railways fall under the jurisdiction of the British Transport Police, a national transit police force that is responsible for policing all railways and some public transit systems in Britain.

==Brazil==
The Brazilian&#x27;s Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 by decree of the emperor Dom Pedro II, making it the oldest police agency in Brazil. There are some proposals in the Brazilian Senate to reactivate this police agency, as it is considered important to national security.

==Canada==
Canadian railways, like those of the United States, aided in nation-building and brought new police agencies into existence. Railway constables are given full police powers within 500 meters of property that the railway company owns, possesses or administers. The Canadian Pacific Railway initially relied on the Dominion Police, and later the North-West Mounted Police during construction of the transcontinental railroad, but by the later 1880s were employing their own police.

The large numbers of navvies recruited to build the railways brought security problems for rail companies. In 1900, the CPR established its Special Service Department. It worked closely with municipal, federal, and provincial police and given a mandate to prevent and investigate pilferage, theft, vandalism, and sabotage as well as policing strikes. The CPR Special Service were also responsible for closely guarding Chinese workers, who were considered &quot;detainees&quot; and virtually treated as prisoners under the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; of 1885. The Special Service was dissolved in 1904, following a scandal involving the business practices of a CPR Labour Department agent in Montreal, but was resurrected in 1913 as the railway&#x27;s Department of Investigation.

The Canadian Pacific Police Service, Canadian National Police Service, and VIA Rail Canada Police Service are the only federal railway police services operating in Canada. Police officers for the railways are federally sworn under the &quot;Railway Safety Act&quot;. This act allows a superior court (federal) judge to appoint a person as a police constable. These officers are employed by the railway and are in place strategically within Canada&#x27;s rail infrastructure with a primary focus on reducing deaths and injuries along each railway&#x27;s network of operations. These officers typically work on investigations involving criminal and provincial violations, such as traffic enforcement and accident investigations, and working to educate the public about the dangers of rail operations and consequences that can result from complacency.

These police officers are also appointed or sworn provincially to provide additional police powers as it relates to each province&#x27;s interest. The primary jurisdictional police are still responsible for all law enforcement in their jurisdiction, and due to reduced manpower and coverage the railway police are considered a secondary response agency. Often the primary jurisdictional police are required to deal with matters that occur on or in relation to railway property. Depending on the seriousness of the incident, railway police may assume jurisdiction, though due to their reduced numbers and capabilities they may require local police to assume control over an incident and act in a supporting role. Railway police also support local police at incidents not in relation to the railway.

===Transit police===

==== Police forces ====
* Metro Vancouver Transit Police
* Canadian Pacific Police Service
* Canadian National Police Service
* Via Rail Police Service

==== Special constables ====
Other large Canadian transit networks use security officers appointed as special constables or peace officers. As special constables, they typically have full police powers when working on transit property to enforce the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; of Canada, as well as respective bylaws. While they carry some police equipment, such as a protective vest, baton, handcuffs and pepper spray, they do not carry a firearm. These officers assist local jurisdiction&#x27;s police officers in investigations of illegal activity on the transit system.
*Calgary Transit Public Safety and Enforcement Section
*Edmonton Transit Protective Services
*GO Transit Special Constables
*OC Transpo Special Constable Service
*Toronto Transit Commission Transit Enforcement Unit
**Toronto Police Service also has a Transit Patrol Unit to assist TTC special constables and patrol the network.
*YRT/Viva Special Constable Services

==People&#x27;s Republic of China==

The governing body of almost all railroad operations—the Chinese Ministry of Railways, which was also the owner of a great deal of the country&#x27;s rail network—operated a massive police force that provided security service inside major railroad hubs and stations and outside along the railroads. Their jurisdiction extends to the limit of MoR property, yet occasionally the jurisdiction overlaps with local forces, in case it was an offence that occurred inside MoR facility, or related to MoR operations.

The railroad police of PRC can be considered as the only civil police force under the command of an agency of central government, more precisely the MoR. Its branches distribute in parallel to the railway bureaus of MoR, and for a period of time, it was considered its subsidiary, since the &quot;railway bureau&quot; is an entity of mixed nature: as a government agency as well as a corporation. Consequently, some railroad police agency will cover several regions of operation on a provincial level. For example, the division level Tianjin railroad police force will answer to the prefecture level Beijing railroad police bureau, despite the fact that regular police force of Tianjin is collateral to its Beijing equivalence. While supervised by the Ministry of Public Security, the force was funded exclusively by MoR itself, therefore often was criticized for protecting corporate interest under MoR. Since it is prevalent in PRC that local police force was conscripted as a private army of individuals, such criticism actually reflects the dispute between local and central government at some level.

==Germany==
&quot;Bahnschutzpolizei&quot; was the railroad police of Nazi Germany. It was tasked with railway safety and also with preventing espionage and sabotage of railway property. It was not subordinated to Hauptamt Ordnungspolizei, only the Deutsche Reichsbahn.

&quot;Bahnpolizei&quot; was the name of the former Railway police of West Germany and fell under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Deutsche Bundesbahn&quot; federal railway company. &quot;Bahnpolizei&quot; officers investigated trespassing on rail property, assaults against passengers, terrorism threats targeting the railway, arson, tagging of graffiti on railroad rolling stock or buildings, signal vandalism, pickpocketing, ticket fraud, robbery, and theft of personal belongings, baggage, or freight. They also investigated train/vehicle collisions and hazardous materials releases.

In 1992 the railway security mission was transferred to the &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; which resulted in the merger of the &quot;Bahnpolizei&quot; into the Federal Border Guard Force. The BGS had already taken on these duties in 1990 for the territory of the former East Germany, replacing the former East German &quot;Transportpolizei&quot;. The &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; was then renamed the &quot;Bundespolizei&quot; (Federal Police) on July 1, 2005, and this force is currently responsible for security and passenger checks on the German railway system.

==India==

The protection of Indian Railways is carried out by the Railway Protection Force and the Government Railway Police.
The Mission of the Railway Protection Force includes to protect and safeguard railway passengers, passenger area and railway property
and also to ensure the safety, security and boost the confidence of the traveling public in the Indian Railways.

==Indonesia==
Polsuska (Indonesian: &quot;Polisi Khusus Kereta Api&quot; or Railroad Special Police) is a law enforcement unit under the auspices of the Indonesian Railway Company. Polsuska in its role as a special railroad police is tasked to: apply sanctions in accordance with legislation and implement security, prevention of crime, and prevent non-justice actions within the scope of the Indonesian railways as a partner of the national police. Polsuska has the responsibilities relating to law and order including security of railway stations and train users. Polsuska officers wear black as their uniform and wear orange berets pulled to the left. Polsuska is trained by but not part of the Indonesian National Police. Polsuska is under the command of the Indonesian Railway Company&#x27;s Directorate of Safety and Security.

The Commuter Lines which serve Greater Jakarta maintains its own security force which are categorized as security guards, their uniform are light-brown and wear orange vest and are known as &quot;(Petugas Keamanan Dalam/PKD)&quot;. These are not part of Polsuska.

Every railway station in Indonesia also operates several security guards to assist Polsuska in the field of law and order including security. During peak seasons such as during the last days of Ramadan and other national holidays, Polsuska may be assisted by members from the military and police to provide additional security presence within the Indonesian Railways.

==Italy==
Policing of Italian State Railways (&quot;Ferrovie dello Stato&quot;) is carried out by the Polizia Ferroviaria, a branch of Italy&#x27;s national police force (Polizia di Stato) operating under the authority of the Minister of the Interior.

==Pakistan==

Pakistan Railways Police, an agency under the Ministry of Railways, is responsible for guarding trains and passengers in the country. 
==Russia==
The MVD Transport Department protects the rail system in Russia. The police is part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and is responsible for protecting the railway, checking train quality, and maintaining railway safety in the Russian Federation.

==Switzerland==
Switzerland never had a separate transport police because all rail employees had limited police authority. However, due to the introduction of trains with no conductors in the late 1990s, crime in trains increased and the Swiss Federal Railways rail company trained &quot;Bahnpolizei&quot; officers for its driver-only commuter trains.

In 2002 the SBB-CFF-FFS merged its &quot;Bahnpolizei&quot; force with the private security company Securitas AG and the resulting Securitrans is now a separate security agency protecting railroad infrastructures.

Since 2011, the rail police has been reorganised, and the Transport Police of Switzerland (&quot;Transportpolizei&quot;) are state employees, with all officers attending two years of police academy training with final certification.

Transportpolizei officers are sworn as officers to the Swiss Confederation, and thus have the same power to arrest as any other cantonal police officers. As their state counterparts, they usually carry a SIG Sauer P225 and pepper sprays as weapons, along with handcuffs for restrain options.

==United Kingdom==
The British Transport Police protects the rail system in Great Britain, due to the nationalisation of the railways in 1948. Prior to this, individual railways had their own police forces.

==United States==

===History===
The history of railroad police in the United States traces back to the beginnings of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. In the mid nineteenth century, the number of U.S. Marshals was insufficient to police the railway lines sprawling across the vast frontier.

Passing through areas far removed from the protective measures available in populated centers left railroad lines and their passengers and freight vulnerable to banditry. Through his detective business, Allan Pinkerton met George B. McClellan, the president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad and Illinois Central Railroad, as well as its attorney, Abraham Lincoln. With Lincoln&#x27;s encouragement, Pinkerton began supplying detectives for the railroad.

Railroad contracts were subsequently a mainstay of Pinkerton&#x27;s until railroad companies gradually developed their own police departments in the years following the Civil War. After the founding of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in 1863, Pinkerton&#x27;s and the new railroad police agencies became instrumental in crushing strikes of rail workers.

Another major concern was pilferage by employees, especially the passenger conductor, who had the greatest authority and freedom on passenger trains and collected ticket fees. Pinkerton began this work for the South Michigan Line in 1854, and on 1 February 1855, he created the North West Police Agency with $10,000 given for the cause by six anxious Midwestern railroads.

===Jurisdiction and authority===
Railroad police are certified law enforcement officers responsible for protecting railroad property, cargo, and employees, and they often work in partnership with local, state, and federal law enforcement. However, critics argue that the broad powers of railroad police, combined with a lack of public accountability, create significant potential for conflicts of interest.

The appointment, commissioning, and regulation of railroad police under Section 1704 of the U.S. Crime Control Act of 1990, provides that: &quot;A railroad police officer who is certified or commissioned as a police officer under the laws of any one state shall, in accordance with the regulations issued by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, be authorized to enforce the laws of any other state in which the rail carrier owns property.&quot;

Section 1704 also states that this police authority is to &quot;the extent of the authority of a police officer certified or commissioned under the laws of that jurisdiction&quot;. While railroad police officers may have general police officer authority in some states such as California, they are limited to the railroad&#x27;s property in other states.

The status of railroad police officers varies by state, in that they are commissioned by the governor of the state in which they reside and/or work in and they may carry both state level arrest powers and some interstate arrest powers as allowed by 49 USC 28101. Although railroad police primarily enforce laws on or near the railroad right-of-way, their police officers can enforce other laws and make arrests off of railroad property depending on the state in which they are working.

Depending upon the state or jurisdiction, railroad police officers may be considered certified police officers, deputized peace officers, or company special agents. In Virginia, for example, any railroad may file an application with the circuit court of any county where it operates to allow the president of the railroad to appoint members of its own police force.

Some of the crimes railroad police investigate include trespassing on the right-of-way of a railroad, assaults against passengers, terrorism threats targeting the railroad, arson, tagging of graffiti on railroad rolling stock or buildings, signal vandalism, pickpocketing, ticket fraud, robbery, and theft of personal belongings, baggage, or freight. Other incidents railroad police investigate include derailments, train/vehicle collisions, vehicle accidents on the right of way, and hazardous materials releases.

Most railroad police agencies are participants in the FBI&#x27;s Joint Terrorism Task Force.

===Railroad police agencies===
====Private railroad agencies====
Private railroad police officers are deputized by individual states. For example, in Massachusetts, railroad and ferry company employees may be appointed as special Massachusetts State Police officers with jurisdiction on company property and vehicles. Federal regulations extend the authority granted by one state to a railroad police officer to all the states in which that railroad has property.

<text>Arthur Zimmermann (5 October 1864 – 6 June 1940) was State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the German Empire from 22 November 1916 until his resignation on 6 August 1917. His name is associated with the Zimmermann Telegram during World War I. He was also closely involved in plans to support rebellions in Ireland and in India, and to assist the Bolsheviks to undermine Tsarist Russia.

==Career==

He was born in Marggrabowa, East Prussia, then in the Kingdom of Prussia (present-day Olecko, Mazury, Poland). He studied law from 1884-87 in Königsberg, East Prussia, and Leipzig. A period as a junior lawyer followed and later he received his doctorate of law. In 1893, he took up a career in diplomacy and entered the consular service in Berlin. He arrived in China in 1896 (Canton in 1898), and rose to the rank of consul in 1900. While stationed in the Far East, he witnessed the Boxer Rebellion in China. As part of his transfer to the Foreign Office, he returned to Germany in 1902. A portion of this trip was via railroad across the Continental United States, a fact he would later use to inflate his supposed expertise on the nation.

Later he was called to the Foreign Office, became Under Secretary of State in 1911, and on 24 November 1916, he accepted his confirmation as Secretary of State, succeeding Gottlieb von Jagow in this position. He had assumed a large share of his superior&#x27;s negotiations with foreign envoys for several years prior to his appointment because of Jagow&#x27;s reservation in office. He was the first non-aristocrat to serve as foreign secretary.

===&quot;Kronrat&quot;===
As acting secretary Zimmermann took part in the so-called &quot;Kronrat&quot;, the deliberations in 1914, with Kaiser Wilhelm II and Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, in which the decision was taken to support Austria-Hungary after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria at Sarajevo, which ultimately was to lead to the outbreak of war. He later disavowed the name &quot;Kronrat&quot; since it was the Kaiser&#x27;s opinion that was decisive in the discussion, but with which Bethmann Hollweg and Zimmermann concurred.

===Irish rebellion===
In late 1914, Zimmermann was visited by Roger Casement, the Irish nationalist. A plan was laid to land 25,000 soldiers in the west of Ireland with 75,000 rifles. However, the German general staff did not agree. In April 1916, Casement returned to Ireland in a U-boat and was captured and executed. A German ship (the &quot;Libau&quot;) renamed the &quot;Aud&quot;, flying Norwegian colours, shipped 20,000 rifles to the south Irish coast, but it failed to link up with the rebels and was scuttled. Planning on this support, the Irish Volunteers launched the Easter Rising in Dublin. Though the Rising failed, its political effect led on to the Irish War of Independence in 1919–22 and the formation of the Irish Free State.

===Zimmermann telegram and resignation===
====Background====
Two and a half years into World War I, the United States had maintained a status of neutrality while the Allied armies had been fighting those of the Central Powers in the trenches of northern France and Belgium. Although President Woodrow Wilson had been re-elected – winning the election on the slogan, &quot;He kept us out of the war&quot; – it became increasingly difficult to maintain that position.

After the Royal Navy had been engaged in a successful naval blockade against all German shipping for some time, the German Supreme High Command concluded that only a total submarine offensive would break the stranglehold. Although the decision was made on 9 January 1917, the Americans were not informed of the operation until 31 January. 

The Germans abrogated their Sussex pledge (not to sink merchant ships without due warning and to save human lives wherever possible) and began an unrestricted U-boat campaign on 1 February 1917. Since it was obvious that US shipping would also come under attack in the course of this operation, it became just a matter of time before the USA was drawn into the conflict.

Germany had been pursuing various interests in Mexico since the beginning of the 20th century. Although a latecomer in the area, with Spain, Britain, and France having established themselves there centuries earlier, the Kaiser&#x27;s Germany attempted to secure a continuing presence. This entailed many different approaches to the Mexican Republic and its changing, often revolutionary, governments as well as assuring the United States (most of the time) of Germany&#x27;s peaceful intentions. German diplomacy in the area depended on sympathetic relations with the Mexican government of the day. Among the options discussed during Arthur Zimmermann&#x27;s period in office was a German offer to improve communications between the two nations and a suggestion that Mexico purchase German submarines for its navy. After Francisco Villa&#x27;s cross-border raids into New Mexico President Wilson sent a punitive expedition into Mexico to pursue the raiders.

This encouraged the Germans to believe (mistakenly) that this and other US concerns in the area would tie up US resources and military operations for some time to come, sufficiently to justify the overtures made by Arthur Zimmermann in his telegram to the Venustiano Carranza government.
His proposals included an agreement for a German alliance with Mexico, while Germany would still try to maintain a state of neutrality with the United States. If this policy were to fail, the note suggested, the Mexican government should make common cause with Germany, try to persuade the Japanese government to join the new alliance, and attack the US. Germany for its part would promise financial assistance and the restoration of its former territories of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to Mexico.

====Effect====

On 24 February, the telegram was finally delivered to the US ambassador in Britain, Walter Hines Page, who two days later retransmitted it to President Wilson. On 1 March, the United States Government passed the text of the telegram to the press. At first, some sectors of the US papers, especially those of the Hearst press empire, questioned whether the telegram was a forgery made by British intelligence in an attempt to persuade the US government to enter the war on Britain&#x27;s side. This opinion was reinforced by German and Mexican diplomats, as well as pro-German and pacifist opinion-formers in the United States. However, on 29 March 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech to the Reichstag confirming the text of the telegram and so put an end to all speculation as to its authenticity. By that time a number of US ships had been torpedoed with heavy loss of life.

On 2 April, President Wilson asked Congress to agree to declare war on Germany, citing, among other grievances, that Germany &quot;means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors&quot;. On 6 April, Congress approved the resolution for war by a wide margin, with the Senate voting 82 to 6 in favor. The United States had entered World War I on the side of the Allies.

====Zimmermann&#x27;s speech====
On 29 March 1917, Zimmerman delivered a speech intended to explain his side of the situation. He began that he had not written a letter to Carranza but had given instructions to the German ambassador via a &quot;route that had appeared to him to be a safe one&quot;.

He also said that despite the submarine offensive, he had hoped that the USA would remain neutral. His instructions (to the Mexican government) were only to be carried out after the US declared war, and he believed his instructions to be &quot;absolutely loyal as regards the US&quot;. In fact, he blamed President Wilson for breaking off relations with Germany &quot;with extraordinary roughness&quot; after the telegram was received, and that therefore the German ambassador &quot;no longer had the opportunity to explain the German attitude, and that the US government had declined to negotiate&quot;.

====Mexico&#x27;s reply====
Later, a general assigned by Carranza to assess the realities of a Mexican takeover of their former provinces came to the conclusion that it would not work. Taking over the three states would almost certainly cause future problems and possibly war with the US; Mexico would also be unable to accommodate a large Anglo population within its borders; and Germany would not be able to supply the arms needed in the hostilities that would surely arise. Carranza declined Zimmermann&#x27;s proposals on 14 April.

===Peace in the East===

In March 1917, with the imminent collapse of the Russian front, Zimmermann took steps to promote a peace with the Russians, a proposal that was of immense importance to Germany at the time. The foreign secretary set forth the following: regulations for frontline contacts with the opposite side; reciprocal withdrawal of the occupied areas; an amicable agreement about Poland, Lithuania, and Kurland; and a promise to aid Russia in its reconstruction and rehabilitation. Last but not least, Lenin and the émigré revolutionaries would be allowed to pass through Germany to Russia by train. These proposals once carried out, would free Germany&#x27;s armies in the east and allow them to be concentrated in the west, a master-stroke that would reinforce the German western front vastly.

===Fact-finding mission of Nuncio Pacelli===

At the end of June 1917, Zimmermann found the first real opportunity for paving the way to peace negotiations during his period of administration. At several meetings with the Bavarian Nuncio Eugenio Pacelli (later to become Pope Pius XII) and Uditore Schioppa, who were on a fact-finding mission, Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg and Zimmermann outlined their plans. There would be no annexations of territories, no border adjustments with Russia, Poland was to remain an independent state, all occupied areas of France and Belgium were to be evacuated, and Alsace-Lorraine would be ceded to France. The only exception in return was to be the restitution of all former German colonies to Germany. None of these plans came to fruition because neither of the two German participants would be very much longer in office.

== Resignation and death ==
On 6 August 1917, Zimmermann resigned as foreign secretary and was succeeded by Richard von Kühlmann. One of the causes of his resignation was the Zimmermann Telegram. He died in Berlin in 1940 of pneumonia.

<text>Transit police (also known as transport police, railway police, railroad police and several other terms) are specialized police agencies employed either by a common carrier, such as a transit district, railway, railroad, bus line, or another mass transit provider or municipality, county, district, or state. 

Transit law enforcement services may also be provided by a specialized unit within a larger local law enforcement agency. Their mandate is generally to prevent and investigate all crime committed against the carrier or its passengers and crime incidentally committed on or around the carrier&#x27;s property.

==Type==
===Autonomous agencies===

A transit police force may consist of officers employed directly by a transit system or by a government agency dedicated to providing specialized law enforcement services. There are numerous instances of both within United States, given the decentralized nature of US law enforcement; examples of larger, stand-alone agencies within the US include the MBTA Police, BART Police, and the New Jersey Transit Police Department. In the United Kingdom, transit law enforcement is provided by a single, nation-wide agency, the British Transport Police, although other law enforcement agencies may assist with this task. Within India, many transit policing services are conducted by the Government Railway Police.

===Specialized units of local law enforcement agencies===

Other forces may exist as a specialized unit of a local law enforcement agency, such as the United States&#x27; Transit Police Services Bureau of the Orange County, California Sheriff&#x27;s Department (which serves the Orange County Transportation Authority) or the Transit Enforcement Unit of the Phoenix Police Department (assigned to the Phoenix Public Transit Department). Some formerly independent transit police agencies have also been absorbed into (or had their duties assumed by) a larger, local law enforcement agency; Examples include the LACMTA Police&#x27;s duties being assumed by the LAPD Transit Services Division and the New York City Transit Police being integrated into the NYPD Transit Bureau.

===Railroad police===

Where the term &quot;transit police&quot; is used for a law enforcement agency or unit working for a railroad/railway, it usually refers to a railroad providing urban mass transit (such as a city-elevated system or subway) as opposed to long-distance rail carriage.

Law enforcement agencies of both cargo railroads and long-haul rail carriers are usually referred to as &quot;railroad police&quot; or &quot;railway police&quot;. There is often considerable overlap in transit police and railroad police agencies’ duties. Railroad police agencies, however, have a long history, and were established separate from and prior to most modern transit police agencies. Transit police and railroad police powers may also be legally defined separately; For example, in the United States, many states have separate laws concerning both types of agencies.

However, in modern times, with increasing overlap in duties and the proliferation of extensive mass transit systems, some jurisdictions have opted for a hybrid model of railroad and transit policing. For instance, in the United Kingdom, most of the rail systems, including the London Underground, are policed by the British Transport Police (BTP). The BTP is a full-service, national law enforcement agency, which essentially combined the duties of dozens of now-defunct transit and railway police agencies into a single entity (the BTP has no authority in Northern Ireland, except in emergencies).

===Powers===
Some transit police forces have full policing powers, such as the US&#x27; BART Police, SEPTA&#x27;s Transit Police, Metro Transit Police Department, Utah Transit Authority Police Department or the MBTA Police. The UK&#x27;s British Transport Police, also has full police powers within Great Britain. In some areas, transit police agencies have limited or specific powers, and may be classed as special police or special constables, or peace officers with limited powers, such as Canada&#x27;s Edmonton Transit Peace Officers. Regardless, transit police services nearly always hold more authority than un-sworn, security guard-only services.

===Crimes===

Some of the crimes transit police and railroad police investigate include trespassing on the right-of-way of a railroad, assaults against passengers, tagging of graffiti on railroad rolling stock and buses or bus stops, pickpocketing, ticket fraud, robbery and theft of personal belongings, baggage or freight, and drug dealing at transit stations. They may also engage in random ticket checking hoping to catch and fine ticketless travelers. These controls are usually more frequent in transit systems using an honor-based fare collecting approach.

==Jurisdiction and authority==

In federal states like the United States, Canada, or Australia, federal and state statutes determine the jurisdiction and authority of all police departments, including transit police.

Most transit police services have the same police authority as any other national, state and local police agencies, such as the MBTA Transit Police Department, MARTA (Atlanta) Transit Police, British Transport Police, New Jersey Transit Police Department, BART Police, Maryland Transit Administration Police, DART Police, SEPTA Transit Police, Utah Transit Authority Police Department, and the Metro Vancouver Transit Police (South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service). Some agencies have rather extensive jurisdictions, including traffic enforcement and arrest powers on and off property, for example, the New Jersey Transit Police Department maintains the distinction of being the only transit police agency in the United States with statewide authority.

===Canada===

==== Police services ====

There are two transit police agencies in Canada: the Metro Vancouver Transit Police, a provincially-regulated &quot;designated policing unit&quot; within TransLink, the transit authority for the Metro Vancouver Regional District in British Columbia; and the Via Rail Police Service, a federally-regulated railway police force operated by Via Rail, the provider of intercity rail service for all of Canada. There are also two other federally-regulated railway police services serving the country&#x27;s two largest freight railways, the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City.

==== Special constabularies ====
In Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, large transit systems maintain special constabularies, a type of unarmed police force, to provide safety and law enforcement services on transit property. These agencies have authority over transit by-laws and provincial legislation; the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; of Canada in Ontario and Quebec; and their officers variously have the ability to use emergency vehicles with sirens (in Alberta, parts of Ontario, and Quebec) and carry a baton, handcuffs, and pepper spray or gel (in all four provinces).

=====List of transit special constabularies in Canada=====
*Calgary Transit Public Safety and Enforcement Section
*Edmonton Transit Protective Services
*GO Transit Customer Protective Services
*OC Transpo Special Constable Unit
*Société de Transport de Montréal Sûreté des réseaux
*Toronto Transit Commission Transit Enforcement Unit
*Winnipeg Transit Safety Officers
*York Region Transit Enforcement and Security

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Cities in China which have rapid transit systems all have their transit police force associated to the local public security bureau. There are no non-governmental police forces, or police institutes under transit authority. National Rail used to have a police force under the Ministry of Railways, but such authority has since been transferred to local police agencies.

However, the structure of institutions can be vary from city to city. For example, cities like Tianjin and Chengdu might have a joint public transportation force of division level, operates on all the taxis, bus routes, coaches, rapid transit and ferry lines as well as transportation hubs inside city limit; while Chongqing and Xi&#x27;an have tighter transit cop brigades focused exclusively on protecting the mass transit lines. Again, all these agencies are supervised by the PSBs of higher level.

It has the power to search, arrest, investigate and prosecute, though the ultimate power rests in the hands of the Government Railway Police.

* Commando for Railway Security (CORAS)
*Government Railway Police (GRP)

The Government Railway Police (IAST: &quot;Sarakārī Rēlvē Pulīs&quot;), abbreviated as GRP, is the police force of the respective state governments, tasked with policing on railways and their premises. It operates under the respective state police forces. It was established by the &quot;Railways Act, 1989&quot;, of the Parliament of India. Its duties correspond to those of the District Police in the areas under their jurisdiction, such as patrolling and prevention and detection of crimes but only on railway property. It is the parent agency of the Railway Protection Force (RPF), and aids and provides assistance to it, whose primary duties are to protect and secure all railway property.

The GRP&#x27;s responsibility is to observe law and order on all railway property. Officers are recruited from the Indian Police Service (IPS) and State Police Services (SPS). The force is under control of the police departments of the various State Police Services (SPS) in liaison with Ministry of Railways.

*In The Netherlands, all public transport companies providing public service have their own enforcement officers, these officers often have the BOA status (special investigation officer) and limited police powers (use of force, arrest and use of handcuffs) the main task of these officers is fare enforcement and securing the safety of the public and employees within the transport vehicles.
*The city of Amsterdam, is the only municipality in the Netherlands which operates its own transit enforcement department. The &quot;Veiligheidsteam openbaar vervoer&quot; (Safety team public transport) cooperates with the Amsterdam police in maintaining public order within the public transport, stations an hubs within the city limits, prevent or stop crimes, public assistance, issuing transit information and spotting suspicious behavior. Their uniforms are similar to that of police officers (police style hat, yellow high-visibility jacket and trousers with side striping; the only difference with the uniform of a police officer is that the trouser and hat color are dark grey whereas the police uses navy blue. These enforcement officers are employed by the city, whereas the police officers are employed by the national police. Enforcement officers are equipped with handcuffs and a short police baton and have limited police powers like the use of force, making arrests, detaining people and issuing fines. The city of Amsterdam is currently looking into the possibility to equip the officers with a can of pepperspray; this will probably be in mid 2014.

<text>LonWorks or Local Operating Network is an open standard (ISO/IEC 14908) for networking platforms specifically created to address the needs of control applications. The platform is built on a protocol created by Echelon Corporation for networking devices over media such as twisted pair, power lines, fiber optics, and wireless. It is used for the automation of various functions within buildings such as lighting and HVAC; see building automation.

== Origins and uptake ==

The technology had its origins with chip designs, power lines, twisted pairs, signaling technology, routers, network management software, and other products from Echelon Corporation. In 1999 the communications protocol (then known as LonTalk) was submitted to ANSI and accepted as a standard for control networking (ANSI/CEA-709.1-B). Echelon&#x27;s power line and twisted pair signaling technology were also submitted to ANSI for standardization and acceptance. Since then, ANSI/CEA-709.1 has been accepted as the basis for IEEE 1473-L (in-train controls), AAR electro-pneumatic braking systems for freight trains, IFSF (European petrol station control), SEMI (semiconductor equipment manufacturing), and in 2005 as EN 14908 (European building automation standard). The protocol is also one of several data link/physical layers of the BACnet ASHRAE/ANSI standard for building automation.

China ratified the technology as a national controls standard, GB/Z 20177.1-2006, and as a building and intelligent community standard, GB/T 20299.4-2006; and in 2007 CECED, the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers, adopted the protocol as part of its Household Appliances Control and Monitoring – Application Interworking Specification (AIS) standards.

In 2008, ISO and IEC granted the communications protocol, twisted pair signaling technology, power line signaling technology, and Internet Protocol (IP) compatibility standard numbers ISO/IEC 14908-1, -2, -3, and -4.

== Usage ==

By 2010, approximately 90 million devices were installed with LonWorks technology. Manufacturers in a variety of industries including building, home, street lighting, transportation, utility, and industrial automation have adopted the platform as the basis for their product and service offerings. Statistics as to the number of locations using the LonWorks technology are scarce, but products and applications built on top of the platform include such diverse functions as embedded machine control, municipal and highway/tunnel/street lighting, heating and air conditioning systems, intelligent electricity metering, subway train control, building lighting, stadium lighting and speaker control, security systems, fire detection and suppression, and newborn location monitoring and alarming, as well as remote power generation load control.

== Technical details ==
Two physical-layer signaling technologies, twisted pair &quot;free topology&quot; and power-line carrier, are typically included in each of the standards created around the LonWorks technology. The two-wire layer operates at 78 kbit/s using differential Manchester encoding, while the power line achieves either 5.4 or 3.6 kbit/s, depending on frequency.

Additionally, the LonWorks platform uses an affiliated IP tunneling standard—ISO/IEC 14908-4 (ANSI/CEA-852)—in use by a number of manufacturers to connect the devices on previously deployed and new LonWorks platform-based networks to IP-aware applications or remote network-management tools. Many LonWorks platform-based control applications are being implemented with some sort of IP integration, either at the UI/application level or in the controls infrastructure. This is accomplished with Web services or IP-routing products available in the market.

An Echelon Corporation-designed IC consisting of several 8-bit processors, the &quot;Neuron chip&quot; was initially the only way to implement a LonTalk protocol node and is used in the large majority of LonWorks platform-based hardware. Since 1999, the protocol has been available for general-purpose processors: A port of the ANSI/CEA-709.1 standard to IP-based or 32-bit chips.

== Acquisitions ==

As of 14 September, 2018, Echelon Corporation was acquired by Adesto Technologies Corporation. Adesto was then acquired by Dialog Semiconductor who were then acquired by Renesas Electronics. As of 2024, Renesas continues to offer LonWorks (and BACnet) products.

==Applications using LonWorks==
* Semiconductor manufacturing
* Lighting control systems
* Energy management systems
* Heating/ventilation/air-conditioning systems
* Security systems
* Home automation
* Consumer appliance controls
* Public street lighting, monitoring, and control
* Petrol station control
* Electronically controlled pneumatic braking
* Distributed avionics

==SNVTs (Standard Network Variable Types)==
One of the keys to the interoperability of the system is the standardisation of the variables used to describe physical things to LonWorks. This standards list is maintained by LonMark International, and each standard parameter is known as Standard Network Variable Type (SNVT, pronounced &quot;sniv-it.&quot;) For example, a thermostat might report temperature using the &quot;SNVT_temp,&quot; defined as a 2-byte integer between zero and 65535, and representing a temperature between -274.0 and 6279.5 degrees Celsius at a precision of 0.1 °C.

<text>St Edmundsbury was a local government district and borough in Suffolk, England. It was named after its main town, Bury St Edmunds. The second town in the district was Haverhill. The population of the district was 111,008 at the 2011 Census.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 (along with the abolition of the county of West Suffolk) by the merger of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds, Haverhill Urban District, Clare Rural District and Thingoe Rural District.

Until March 2009, its main offices were in Bury St Edmunds (Angel Hill and Western Way). Thereafter, a purpose-built complex named West Suffolk House housed both St Edmundsbury and Suffolk County Council staff.

In 2008, the Council submitted a proposal to the Boundary Commission which would see it as central to a new West Suffolk unitary council. However, the proposal was rejected and no unitary scheme for Suffolk was adopted. (For more details see also Suffolk.)

In October 2011, St Edmundsbury Borough Council and Forest Heath District Council agreed to have one chief executive, a shared management team and a combined workforce.

St Edmundsbury and Forest Heath were merged on 1 April 2019 to form the new West Suffolk district.

<text>A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose keys are not separate, moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface. Very little tactile feedback is felt when using such a keyboard.

== History ==
Membrane keyboards work by electrical contact between the keyboard surface and the underlying circuits when keytop areas are pressed. These models were used with some early 1980s home computers which lead to greater adoption of the design. The keyboards are inexpensive to produce, and are more resistant against dirt and liquids than some other keyboard types. However, due to a low or non-existent tactile feedback, some people have reported difficulty typing with them, especially when larger numbers of characters are being typed. Chiclet keyboards are a variation of the design.

== Usage ==
Aside from early hobbyist/kit/home computers and some video game consoles, membrane-based QWERTY keyboards are used in some industrial computer systems, and are also found as portable, even &quot;rollable-collapsible&quot; designs for PDAs and other pocket computing devices. Smaller, specialized membrane keyboards, typically numeric-and-a-few-control-keys only, have been used in access control systems (for buildings and restricted areas), simple handheld calculators, domestic remote control keypads, microwave ovens, and other similar devices where the amount of typing is relatively small or infrequent, such as cell phones.

Modern PC keyboards are essentially a membrane keyboard mechanism covered with an array of dome switches which give positive tactile feedback.

== Mechanism ==
The membrane (typically made out of Polyethylene terephthalate or PET) keyboard consists of three layers: two layers containing traces of conductive ink and the center layer is a &quot;spacer&quot; containing holes wherever a two conductive &quot;key&quot; pads count touch upon being pressed. The third layer keeps the other two layers separated in order to prevent short-circuit.

Under normal conditions, the switch (key) is open, because current cannot cross the non-conductive gap between the traces on the bottom layer. However, when the top layer is pressed down (with a finger), it makes contact with the bottom layer. The conductive traces on the underside of the top layer can then bridge the gap, allowing current to flow. The switch is now &quot;closed&quot;, and the parent device registers a keypress.

Many applications benefit from the sealed nature of the membrane keypad. Feedback can easily be provided to the user via audible means (e.g. a beep) or visually (lights or via the display itself), or via both means together. For additional wear resistance, a simple, easily replaceable protective clear sheet can be placed in front of the membrane. Membrane keyboards are widely used in consumer electronics, industrial, commercial, scientific and military equipment.

<doc id="518137" wikidata="Q514109" url="?curid=518137" title="EMS VCS 3">
<text>The VCS 3 (or VCS3; an initialism for &quot;Voltage Controlled Studio, version #3&quot;) is a portable analogue synthesizer with a flexible modular voice architecture introduced by Electronic Music Studios (EMS) in 1969.

EMS released the product under various names. Logos printed at the console&#x27;s front left (see photos) say &quot;V.C.S. 3&quot; on the most widely sold version; &quot;The Putney (VCS 3)&quot; on the earlier version; and &quot;The Synthi (VCS 3) II&quot; on the later version &quot;Synthi VCS 3 II&quot;.

==History==

The VCS 3 was created in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff&#x27;s EMS company. The electronics were designed largely by David Cockerell, and its distinctive appearance was the work of electronic composer Tristram Cary. It was one of the first &quot;portable&quot; commercially available synthesizers, in the sense that it was housed entirely in a small wooden case, unlike synths from American manufacturers such as Moog Music, ARP and Buchla, which had large cabinets and could take up entire rooms.

The VCS 3 cost just under £330 in 1969. Some people found it unsatisfactory as a melodic instrument due to its inherent tuning instability. This arose from the instrument&#x27;s reliance on the then current method of exponential conversion of voltage to oscillator frequency—an approach that other companies also implemented with fewer tuning issues. However, the VCS 3 was renowned as an extremely powerful generator of electronic effects and processor of external sounds for its cost.

The first album recorded using only the VCS 3 was &quot;The Unusual Classical Synthesizer&quot; on Westminster Gold.

The VCS 3 was popular among progressive rock bands, and was used on recordings by Franco Battiato, The Moody Blues, The Alan Parsons Project, Jean-Michel Jarre, Todd Rundgren, Hawkwind, Curved Air, Brian Eno (with Roxy Music and as a solo artist or collaborator), King Crimson, The Who, Gong, and Pink Floyd, and many others. The VCS 3-generated bass sound at the beginning of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; forms the foundation of the song, with its other parts heard in response. Two VCS 3s and a Sequencer 256 were featured in the 1978 film &#x27;The Shout&#x27;.

==Description==

The VCS 3 has three oscillators (the first two normal voltage-controlled oscillators; the third a low-frequency oscillator), a noise generator, two input amplifiers, a ring modulator, 24 dB/octave low-pass voltage-controlled filter, a trapezoid envelope generator, a joystick controller, a voltage-controlled spring reverb unit, and two voltage controlled output amplifiers. Unlike most modular synthesiser systems, which used cables to link components, the VCS 3 uses a distinctive patchboard matrix where pins are inserted to connect its components.

===Keyboards controller===
Although the VCS 3 is often used for generating sound effects due to lack of a built-in keyboard, external keyboard controllers were available for melodic play. The &quot;DK1,&quot; produced in 1969, is an early velocity-sensitive monophonic keyboard for VCS 3 with an extra VCO and VCA. In 1972 it was extended for duophonic play as &quot;DK2&quot;. Also in 1972, the Synthi AKS was released, as well as a digital sequencer with a touch-sensitive flat keyboard, the &quot;KS sequencer&quot;, and its mechanical keyboard version, &quot;DKS.&quot;

===Related models===
The VCS 3&#x27;s basic design was reused by EMS in many other of their own products, most notably the EMS Synthi 100 (1971), the Synthi A (1971), and AKS (1972, essentially a VCS 3 in a plastic briefcase). The AKS also has a sequencer built into the keyboard&#x27;s lid.

A former agent of EMS in the United States, Ionic Industries in Morristown, New Jersey, released a portable-keyboard VCS 3 clone in 1973. The &quot;Ionic Performer&quot;, whose circuitry is based on the VCS 3&#x27;s, replaced the patchboard matrix with over 100 push-buttons, and added a built-in keyboard and effects units.

====Synthi A====


The EMS Synthi A has the same electronics as the VCS 3, but was rehoused in a Spartanite briefcase. Instead of routing signals using patch cables, like Moog products, it uses a patch matrix with resistive pins. The 2700 ohm resistors soldered inside each pin vary in tolerance, indicated by different colours: red pins have 1% tolerance, white have 5%, and green pins are attenuating pins with a resistance of 68,000 ohms.

The later Synthi AKS incorporated an early digital 256 event KS (Keyboard Sequencer) sequencer in the lid, with input provided by a capacitance-sensitive Buchla-style keyboard.

Perhaps its most prominent use is in the introduction to The Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s &quot;I Robot.&quot; (1977). VCS 3 synthesisers were also used alongside a traditional chamber music ensemble for the soundtrack to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Life On Earth&quot; nature documentary series, composed by Edward Williams.

Along with Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream, other frequent users of the instrument include Cabaret Voltaire, Tim Blake &amp; Miquette Giraudy of Gong, Richard Pinhas of Heldon, Merzbow, Thomas Lehn, Cor Fuhler and Alva Noto.

==Development==
The original VCS No.1 was a hand-built rack-mount unit with two oscillators, one filter and one envelope, designed by Cockerell before the formation of EMS. When a benefactor, Don Banks, asked Zinovieff for a synthesiser, Zinovieff and Cockerell decided to work together on an instrument that was small and portable but powerful and flexible.

<doc id="518139" wikidata="Q2860069" url="?curid=518139" title="Archbishop of America">
<text>The Archdiocese of America, better known as the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, is a jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. It was formally constituted in 1922 and has had seven Archbishops. The Archdiocese currently covers the United States and one parish in the Bahamas, and is mostly Greek-American in composition and culture.

== Archbishops of America ==

The following individuals have held the office of Archbishop of America:

* Alexander (Demoglou), Archbishop of America (1922–1930)
* Athenagoras, Archbishop of America (1931–1948)
* Timotheos, Archbishop of America (Elected in 1949)
* Michael, Archbishop of America (1949–1958)
* Iakovos, Archbishop of America (1959–1996)
* Spyridon, Archbishop of America (1996–1999)
* Demetrios, Archbishop of America (1999–2019)
* Elpidophoros, Archbishop of America (2019 to present)

=== Archbishops of the Russian Diocese of the Aleutians and North America ===

The Diocese of the Aleutians and North America was a pan-ethnic and missionary jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Russian Orthodox Church from 1900 to 1922. (Before this period it was known as the &quot;Diocese of the Aleutians and Alaska&quot; from 1870 to 1900; before that, it was part of the Diocese of Kamchatka, Russia, from 1840 to 1870, and before that, of the Diocese of Irkutsk, Russia. From the 1920s until 1970 it was the &quot;Metropolia of All America and Canada&quot; [a/k/a the &quot;Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America&quot;], and since 1970 it has also been known as &quot;The Orthodox Church in America,&quot; covering the United States, Canada, Mexico, and two parishes in Australia.) From 1905 to 1922, its incumbents held the title of Archbishop:

* Saint Tikhon
** Bishop of the Aleutians and Alaska, 1898-1900
** Bishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1900-1905
** Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1905-1907
* Platon (Rozhdestvensky), Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1907-1914
* Evdokim (Meschersky), Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1914-1918
* Alexander (Nemolovsky), Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1919-1922

Since 1922 its incumbents and primates have held the title of Metropolitan of All America and Canada. Today it is majority-Russian in ecclesiastical heritage, but with significant Romanian, Albanian, Bulgarian, and Mexican (in Mexico) jurisdictions and at least one Arab parish - all largely English- (or Spanish-)speaking - as well as increasing numbers of transfers from other Orthodox jurisdictions, and converts to Orthodoxy.

=== Archbishops of the Russian Exarchate of North America ===
The Russian Exarchate of North America was another jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church under its Patriarchate of Moscow from 1933 to 1970. While most of its bishops were titled Metropolitans of varying Sees, the final one was

* Jonathan (Kopolovitch), Archbishop of New York and the Aleutians, 1967–1970.

Moscow was permitted to replace this Exarchate, and a diocese in Canada, with a non-diocesan patriarchal vicariate in each country, the United States and Canada, when it and the Metropolia were reconciled, and Moscow recognized the Metropolia&#x27;s autocephaly, in 1970. These vicariates form the &quot;Russian Orthodox Patriarchal Parishes in the USA&quot;, sometimes described as &quot;Russian Orthodox Church in the USA&quot;, with some patriarchal parishes in Canada.

<doc id="518142" wikidata="Q171449" url="?curid=518142" title="Watkins Glen International">
<text>Watkins Glen International, nicknamed &quot;The Glen&quot;, is an automobile race track in the northeastern United States, located in Dix, New York, just southwest of the village of Watkins Glen, at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It is long known around the world as the former home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980). In addition, the site has also been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association, and the IndyCar Series. The facility is currently owned by NASCAR.

The course was opened in 1956 to host auto races previously held on public roads in and around the village. The circuit&#x27;s current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, with minor modifications after the fatal crashes of François Cevert (1973) and J.D. McDuffie (1991).

The site has also hosted several music concerts: the 1973 Summer Jam, featuring The Allman Brothers Band, the Grateful Dead, and The Band and was attended by 600,000 fans; and two Phish festivals: Super Ball IX in 2011 and Magnaball in 2015.

==Layouts==
The Watkins Glen International racecourse has undergone several changes over time, with five general layouts widely recognized over its history. Currently, two distinct layouts are used: the &quot;Boot&quot; layout (long course) and the &quot;NASCAR&quot; layout (short course).

===Public roads===

The first races in Watkins Glen were organized by Cameron Argetsinger, whose family had a summer home in the area. With local Chamber of Commerce approval and SCCA sanction, the first Watkins Glen Grand Prix took place in 1948 on a course over local public roads. For the first few years, the races passed through the heart of the town with spectators lining the sidewalks. However, after a car driven by Fred Wacker left the road in the 1952 race, killing seven-year-old Frank Fazzari and injuring several others, the race was moved to a new location on a wooded hilltop southwest of town. The original course is listed in the New York State Register and National Register of Historic Places as the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Course, 1948–1952.

The second layout () began use in 1953 and also used existing roads. The Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation was formed to manage spectators, parking, and concessions; this arrangement lasted three years.

===Grand Prix Course===
The first permanent course, known as the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course was constructed on , overlapping part of the previous street course. Designed by Bill Milliken and engineering professors from Cornell University, the layout was used from 1956 to 1970. In 1968, the sports car race was extended to six hours.

===Short Course===

The circuit underwent a major overhaul for the 1971 season. The &quot;Big Bend&quot; and the turns leading up to it were eliminated and replaced with a new pit straight. The pits and start/finish line were moved to this new straightaway. &quot;The 90&quot; now became Turn 1 instead of Turn 8.

When the 1971 Six Hours of Watkins Glen arrived in July 1971, the overall circuit renovations were still unfinished. The short course had been finished, but the Boot segments were not complete, nor was the new pit area. The 1971 Six Hours race was run on the short course layout. That layout colloquially became known as the 1971 Six Hours Course. In addition, for 1971 only, the cars used the original start/finish line and the old pits.

When NASCAR returned to the track in 1986, it used the short course layout. IMSA initially used the &quot;Boot&quot;, but eventually, that series also began using the shorter 1971 layout.

The short course was slightly lengthened in 1992 (see &quot;Inner Loop&quot; below).

===Long Course (The &quot;Boot&quot;)===
The most significant change to the track, a new segment known as &quot;The Boot&quot;, was finished in time for the Formula One race in 1971. The start-finish line was moved to the new pit straight as planned. At the end of the backstretch, after the Loop-Chute, cars swept left into a new four-turn complex that departed from the old layout, curling left-hand downhill through the woods. The track followed the edge of the hillside to two uphill right-hand turns, over an exciting blind crest into a right-hand turn, down and up into a left-hand turn rejoining the old track.

The new layout measured ; with its intrinsic link to the Formula One race, it became known colloquially as the Grand Prix Circuit.

For 1972, the Six Hours sportscar race also began using the full &quot;Boot&quot; layout. By that time, nearly all facility improvements were completed. The pits and start/finish line were permanently moved to the new pit straight.

In 1973, French driver François Cevert, a previous winner at the Glen, died in a crash during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. This led course officials in 1975 to add a fast right-left chicane to slow speeds in the turn 3-4 Esses section. Dubbed the &quot;Scheckter Chicane&quot;, it was eliminated in 1985.

In the early 1990s, the IMSA sports cars bypassed the &quot;Boot&quot; in favor of the short course. NASCAR events have never used the Boot layout. The &quot;Long/Boot&quot; course was slightly lengthened in 1992 (see &quot;Inner Loop&quot; below). In the mid-2000s, the Boot segment, which had seen little use in many years, was repaved and upgraded. When the IndyCar Series returned to Watkins Glen starting in 2005, they used the Boot segment.

The entire course was repaved in 2015. There has been a renewed interest and appreciation of the full Grand Prix Course layout in recent years. Consideration had even been made for NASCAR to start using the Boot.

===Inner Loop===
The most recent significant change to the course was made in 1992, after several serious crashes at the &quot;Loop&quot; at the end of the backstretch. During the 1989 Budweiser at the Glen, Geoff Bodine blew a tire at the end of the backstretch. He broke into a hard spin and sailed straight off the track, crashing head-on into the barrier. In 1991, during the IMSA Camel Continental VIII, Tommy Kendall&#x27;s Intrepid RM-1 prototype crashed in the Loop, severely injuring his legs. Seven weeks later, NASCAR Winston Cup driver J. D. McDuffie died in an accident at the same site during the 1991 Budweiser at The Glen.

Before the 1992 season, track officials constructed a bus stop chicane along the back straight just before the Loop. Dubbed the &quot;Inner Loop&quot;, it led into what was now being called the &quot;Outer Loop.&quot; This addition slightly increased the lap distance for both layouts.

==History==

===Watkins Glen Grand Prix===
Along with the annual SCCA race, the track hosted its first professional race (NASCAR Grand National Division) in 1957. It hosted its first international event with the Formula Libre races from 1958 to 1960. Among the drivers participating were Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss, Phil Hill, and Dan Gurney.

===United States Grand Prix===

After two editions of the Formula One United States Grand Prix that were deemed less than successful (Sebring in 1959, and Riverside in 1960), promoters were looking for a new venue to become the permanent home for the United States Grand Prix.

In 1961, just six weeks before the scheduled date for another Formula Libre race that fall, Argetsinger was tapped to prepare Watkins Glen for the final round of the Formula One World Championship. While many of the necessary preparations had already been made, new pits were constructed to satisfy international standards of pit boxes with overhead cover.

Seven American drivers participated, and the 1961 United States Grand Prix was won by British driver Innes Ireland in a Lotus-Climax. American Dan Gurney driving a Porsche 718 placed second. Having already won both Driver&#x27;s and Constructor&#x27;s World Championships and still mourning the death of Wolfgang von Trips at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari decided not to compete in the United States GP. Ferrari&#x27;s decision not to travel to the United States for the season&#x27;s final round deprived Hill of participating in his home race as the newly crowned World Champion, and Hill appeared only as the event&#x27;s Grand Marshal.

The United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen quickly became an autumnal tradition as huge crowds of knowledgeable racing fans flocked to Upstate New York each year amid the region&#x27;s spectacular autumn leaf color. The race was also among the most popular on the global Grand Prix calendar with the teams and drivers because its starting and prize money often exceeded those of the other races combined. The race received the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association award for the best organized and best staged GP of the season in 1965, 1970, and 1972.

One fixture of the USGP at Watkins Glen was the starter for the races, Richard Norman &quot;Tex&quot; Hopkins. Hopkins was the most recognizable starter in Grand Prix racing, wearing a lavender suit, clenching a big cigar in his mouth, and giving the job everything he had. Once the cars had taken their places, Hopkins strode across the front of the grid with his back to the field, turned, and jumped into the air while waving the national flag to start the race. He would similarly meet the winner at the finish, this time waving the checkered flag as the car crossed the line.

Before the 1971 race, the course underwent its most significant changes of the Grand Prix era, as it was extended from to by the addition of four corners in a new section called the &#x27;Boot&#x27; or &#x27;Anvil&#x27;. The new layout departed from the old course near the south end into a curling downhill left-hand turn through the woods. The track followed the edge of the hillside to two consecutive right-hand turns, over an exciting blind crest to a left-hand turn, and back onto the old track. In addition, the circuit was widened and resurfaced. The pits and start-finish line were moved back before the northwest right-angle corner known as &quot;The 90&quot;. In 1975, a fast right-left chicane was added to slow speeds through the series of corners in the Esses section.

Despite the improvements, the circuit was unsafe for the increasingly faster and stiffer ground effect cars of the late 1970s. A few horrendous, sometimes fatal accidents occurred (such as those that claimed the lives of Helmut Koinigg and François Cevert). Increasingly rowdy segments of the crowd began to tarnish its image as well. Finally, in May 1981, several months after Alan Jones had won the 1980 race for Williams, the International Auto Sports Federation removed the race from its schedule because the track had failed to pay its $800,000 debt to the teams.

===American road-racing Mecca===
The Glen hosted a variety of other events throughout the Grand Prix years: from Can-Am, Trans-Am, IROC, and Endurance Sports car racing, to Formula 5000 and the CART series, these races strengthened the circuit&#x27;s reputation as the premier road racing facility in the United States. From 1968 through 1981, the &quot;Six Hours at The Glen&quot; endurance race featured top drivers such as Mario Andretti, Jacky Ickx, Pedro Rodríguez, and Derek Bell. Different races were sometimes featured together on the same weekend (e.g., Six Hours and Can-Am) and drew sizable crowds. However, without a Formula One race, the circuit struggled to survive. It finally declared bankruptcy and closed in 1981.

===Renovation===
The track was not well maintained for two years and hosted only a few SCCA meets without spectators. In 1983, Corning Enterprises, a subsidiary of nearby Corning, partnered with International Speedway Corporation to purchase the track and rename it Watkins Glen International.

The renovated track, with the chicane at the bottom of the Esses removed, reopened in 1984 with the return of IMSA with the Camel Continental I, which would be conducted until 1995, with the last two years under the name &quot;The Glen Continental&quot; after Camel&#x27;s withdrawal from IMSA. (The event was numbered with Roman numerals.)

In 1986, the top NASCAR series returned to Watkins Glen after a long layoff, holding one of only three road races on its schedule (two beginning in 1988), using the 1971 Six Hours course, raced when the new section off the Loop-Chute was not finished in time. As the cars come off the Loop-Chute, instead of making the downhill left into Turn 6, the cars shot straight through the straight and headed toward Turn 10, as was the case from 1961 until 1970.

NASCAR Busch Series (now called Xfinity Series) action would arrive in 1991 with a race on the weekend of the Camel Continental, won by Terry Labonte, who would be a master of the circuit during its Busch Series races, winning the inaugural race, and winning three consecutive races from 1995 until 1997. The 1995 race would be the first conducted as a race, and became the first Busch Series race to be televised on broadcast network television, as CBS broadcast the race live until TNN took over in 1997.

Only twice—1998 and 1999—did a Busch Series regular driver win the race. The first seven races were won by Winston Cup Series regular drivers, sometimes referred to as &quot;Buschwhackers&quot;, during their off-week. In 1998, the race went against the Cup race in Sonoma, California, eliminating the idea, and stayed that way until 2000. In 2001, the race was run the day after the first Saturday in July.

However, the race was eliminated from the schedule after the 2001 season, only to return in 2005 as an undercard to the Nextel Cup race. 

A pair of incidents in 1991 resulted in a massive overhaul of the circuit&#x27;s safety. During the IMSA Camel Continental VIII, Tommy Kendall&#x27;s prototype crashed in Turn 5, severely injuring his legs. Seven weeks later, NASCAR Cup Series driver J. D. McDuffie died in an accident at the same site in the 1991 Budweiser at the Glen. Track officials added a bus stop chicane to the back straight in Spring 1992.

In 1996, the Glen Continental reverted to a six-hour format, again called the Six Hours at the Glen with the IMSA format, and stayed there until a split in American sports car racing. In 1998, the race became an event sanctioned by the Sports Car Club of America under their United States Road Racing Championship. In 1999, the FIA GT series staged a 500 km race of three hours with some USRRC entrants after USRRC canceled the last two rounds of their season before their six-hour event at the track. The following year, the six-hour race returned once again with the newly founded Grand American Road Racing Association (Grand-Am) sanctioning the event. The event is now sanctioned by IMSA with the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. The six-hour race is now the third part of the four-part North American Endurance Cup series.

In 1997, International Speedway Corporation became the sole owner of the course, as Corning Enterprises believed they had completed their intended goals to rebuild the race track and increase tourism in the southern Finger Lakes region of New York State.

The circuit annually hosts one of the nation&#x27;s premier vintage events, the Zippo U.S. Vintage Grand Prix. When the fiftieth anniversary of road racing in Watkins Glen was celebrated during the 1998 racing season, this event was the climax, returning many original cars and drivers to the original street circuit through the village during the Grand Prix Festival Race Reenactment.

After a 25-year layoff, major-league open-wheel racing returned to the track as one of three road courses on the 2005 Indy Racing League schedule. In preparation, the circuit was overhauled again. Grandstands from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Nazareth Speedway, which had closed, were installed, the gravel in The 90 was removed and replaced with a paved runoff area, and curbing was cut down for the Indy Racing League event. Previously, the high curbing in the chicane had become a place where Cup Series cars would bounce high off the curbing, creating an ideal opportunity for cars to lose control and to slow cars. Other areas of the track received improvements: the exits of turn 2 (the bottom of the esses), the chicane, turn 6 (the entrance to the boot), turn 9, and turn 11 all had additional runoff areas created and safety barrier upgrades. The carousel runoff was paved, and turn 1 (the 90), and the esses were paved in the winter of 2006–07. Augmenting what was already in place along the front stretch, additional high safety fences were installed on the overpasses crossing the service roads at the top of the esses and just out of the boot immediately after the exit of turn 9.
Another overhaul for 2006 made fundamental changes to the circuit for the first time since 1992. Officials installed a new control tower, which includes booths for the officials, timing and scoring, television and radio (the new position allows broadcasters to see more action from Turn 10 through the foot of the Esses), and the public address announcer on top of the new front stretch grandstand, moving the start-finish line farther ahead of the bridge, as the start-finish line is moved farther toward The 90 in order to accommodate the new timing and scoring post. The new start-finish line also meant the starting lights used for club races were moved farther ahead, creating more action off Turn 11 as tactics changed with the later finish line, where slingshot moves could become paramount to the finish. A new media center was constructed to replace the former building, which also had been the control tower with the 1971 improvements. The aging structure had been the bane of many professional media members during those years with many uncomplimentary things published and broadcast about its inadequacies, especially the lack of insulation, air conditioning, few (if any) amenities that other facilities had, which resulted in race control moving to the new control tower at the start-finish line in 2006. Plans were made to move the new media center back to allow an entire 43-car NASCAR grid. Other changes to the infrastructure included the purchase of adjoining property. Most of Bronson Hill Road was incorporated as a service road to the facility. A new section of Bronson Hill leading up from NY 414 was built as the main ingress road to the facility, bending south at Gate 6 and continuing to County Road 16, just south of the credentials and sheriff&#x27;s office buildings.

Track safety also is constantly changing, and constant training is needed. Race Services Inc. provides the track with volunteers to work Fire-Rescue, Medical, Grid personnel, and Corner workers to help keep drivers and spectators safe.

The Argetsinger family is an advisor to the circuit. The track named the trophy for the inaugural Watkins Glen Indy Grand Prix presented by Argent in honor of the late patriarch, Cameron.

On Tuesday, March 6, 2007, just before 9 pm, a fire destroyed the recently remodeled Glen Club situated on top of the esses. Originally called the Onyx Club (named for the sponsor, Onyx Cologne), the Glen Club was used primarily as an upscale venue for race fans. After being recently remodeled, it was advertised as a social venue for locals for weddings, business meetings, etc. No cause could be determined, and the building was a total loss. The loss included irreplaceable, unique original motorsport artwork donated to the facility by several artists and other racing memorabilia. Glen officials were quoted in local media stories as being adamant that the loss of the Glen Club would not affect the 2007 racing schedule.

For 2007, Watkins Glen International again improved the facility, specifically the track surface. All of turns 1 (the &quot;90&quot;), 5 (the &quot;Loop-Chute&quot;) and 6 (entry turn into the &quot;Boot&quot;) were repaved. A temporary &quot;Glen Club&quot; replaced the permanent structure destroyed by fire at the races in 2007, which was replaced with another permanent building. New sponsors for both the INDY and NASCAR weekends were signed to multi-year deals. Camping World became the sponsor of the &quot;Camping World Grand Prix&quot; INDY weekend at the Glen through 2010. The NASCAR weekend at the Glen received a double shot—Zippo Manufacturing announced a three-year extension of the Busch-Nationwide Series race, the &quot;Zippo 200&quot;. The NASCAR Cup Series race became known as &quot;The Heluva Good! Sour Cream dips at the Glen&quot;. Additionally, Brad Penn lubricants of Pennsylvania (former Kendall Oil refinery) was announced as the sponsor of the annual vintage sports car weekend for 2007 and 2008. IndyCar took a six-year hiatus from the facility when the series pulled out of the Glen after 2010 due to a dispute with track owner ISC.

In June 2011, Tony Stewart and Lewis Hamilton participated in the &quot;Mobil 1 Seat Swap&quot;. Stewart drove his No. 14 Mobil 1 Chevy for four laps around the circuit while Hamilton drove the MP4-23, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes&#x27;s entry in the 2008 Formula One season. After some time, both drivers swapped cars and drove more laps around the circuit. The event was open to the public, and it was hoped that it would renew interest in the track. Before this event, the curbs on some of the turns were changed, the white rumble strips being replaced by the more common, red-white designs seen on most road courses around the world.

In July 2011, WGI hosted a Phish concert. This is the first concert that WGI has held since the Summer Jam.

In October 2012, the track suffered damage from Hurricane Sandy, with damage reported to be up to $50,000.
Prior to the 2014 season, the track cleaned out a storage barn on track property when the original Dunlop Bridge was found. The bridge was initially used as a VIP area for Dunlop until being moved for use as the starters stand years later. It was taken down and replaced by a new starters stand during renovations in 2006. The bridge was put back up at the exit to the 90 near the original location where it once stood near the original start/finish line for the track and is now once again used for VIP use by companies on race weekends, with the company sponsoring the bridge.

After the 2014 racing season, it was announced that the 2015 racing season would conclude with the NASCAR weekend in early August. This was to allow for a complete repaving of the track. The repave involved removing the entire racing surface. In some places, the track was taken down to the dirt roadbed. This was funded not only by International Speedway Corporation but with a grant from New York State.

In March 2015, due to their previous concert&#x27;s success, Phish said they would do another concert at WGI in late August.

In August 2015, with repaving already having taken place in the Boot, NASCAR announced that they are considering running the complete Grand Prix Course. But as of 2022, NASCAR is still not using the Boot, and the use or not of the Boot is still a debate between NASCAR and fans.

2016 would see the return of IndyCar racing to Watkins Glen, with the track being added to the schedule following the collapse of plans for a street race in Boston. It was held over the Labor Day weekend and used the full layout: ICS officials were also negotiating with WGI to race there permanently.

<text>The Bitterroot Range is a mountain range and a subrange of the Rocky Mountains that runs along the border of Montana and Idaho in the northwestern United States. The range spans an area of and is named after the bitterroot (&quot;Lewisia rediviva&quot;), a small pink flower that is the state flower of Montana.

== History ==
1805, the Corps of Discovery, led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and aided by Sacajawea of the Shoshone tribe, crossed the Bitterroot Range several times. Lewis first crossed the mountains at Lemhi Pass on August 12, then returned across the pass to meet Clark. The entire expedition then crossed the pass to the Salmon River valley, and the next month entered the Bitterroot Valley from the south via either Lost Trail Pass or Chief Joseph Pass. It then crossed Lolo Pass to the west. In June 1806 the Corps of Discovery was then lead by 5 members of the Nez Percé back across the Bitterroot Range, from west to east. The Bitterroots also presented a massive problem for the expedition, ending their hope of finding an all water Northwest Passage. The mountains were crossed by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the &quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;).

== Ranges ==
According to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, the Bitterroot Range runs from Pend Oreille Lake (near Sandpoint, Idaho) to Monida Pass. It is sometimes considered to extend east of the Monida Pass to include the Centennial Mountains. The range comprises the following subranges (from north to south):

=== Coeur d&#x27;Alène Mountains ===

The Coeur d&#x27;Alène Mountains are the northwesternmost portion of the Bitterroot Range and encompass an area of . The mountain range&#x27;s two highest peaks are the 7,352 foot (2,241 m) Cherry Peak and the 6,837 foot (2,084 m) Patricks Knob.

=== Saint Joe Mountains ===
The Saint Joe Mountains, the smallest named portion of the Bitterroot Range, encompass an area of 698 square miles (1,808 km2). They lie between the St. Joe River on the south, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River on the north, the Slate Creek saddle on the east and the plateau of the Moscow, Idaho/Pullman, Washington area on the Idaho/Washington border.

=== Bitterroot Mountains ===

The Bitterroot Mountains, comprising the Northern and Central Bitterroot Ranges, are the largest portion of the Bitterroot Range and encompass an area of 4,862 square miles (12,593 km2). The mountains are bordered on the north by Lolo Creek, on the south by the Salmon River, on the east by the Bitterroot River and Valley, and on the west by the Selway and Lochsa Rivers. Its highest summit is Trapper Peak, at 10,157 feet (3,096 m).

=== Beaverhead Mountains ===

The Beaverhead Mountains encompass an area of 4,532 square miles (11,738 km2). They lie to the east of the Bitterroot Mountains and lie to the west of the Big Hole Basin and the Pioneer Mountains. Passes in the mountains include Lemhi Pass, Bannock Pass, Big Hole Pass, Big Hole Pass II, Junction Pass and Monida Pass. The Beaverheads are further subdivided into the West Big Hole Mountains, the Big Hole Divide, the Tendoy Mountains, the Italian Peaks, and the Garfield Peaks.

=== Centennial Mountains ===

The Centennial Mountains encompass an area of 2,064 square miles (5,346 km2).

The Centennials are home to Brower&#x27;s Spring, discovered in 1888 by Jacob V. Brower, which is believed to be the furthest point on the Missouri River. Brower published his finding in 1896 in &quot;The Missouri: Its Utmost Source.&quot;

The site of Brower&#x27;s Spring is at about 8,800 feet (2,680 m) in elevation in the Centennials. The site is now commemorated by a rock cairn at the source of Hellroaring Creek, which flows into the Red Rock River and then into Clark canyon reservoir, where it joins the Beaverhead River and then the Big Hole River, before ultimately joining with the Jefferson River.

<doc id="518150" wikidata="Q5100180" url="?curid=518150" title="Chinatown bus lines">
<text>Chinatown bus lines are discount intercity bus services in the United States, often operated by Chinese Americans, primarily Fujianese. They operate with lower overhead and lower fares compared to competing services. Destinations include most major cities as well as casinos popular with Asian Americans.

As a result of safety issues and several fatal crashes, most Chinatown bus lines were shut down by regulatory authorities in 2012. Others continue to operate with increased oversight.

==History==
===Early history===

Chinese-operated intercity bus service began when the Chinese working class and new immigrants, particularly Chinese restaurant workers who found jobs in other cities, needed to travel to and from New York City, Boston, and Atlantic City. The first companies to offer Chinese intercity bus service had minimal features, including unmarked curbside bus stops and no advertising or customer service; this greatly reduced overhead costs. In 1998, two companies began operations: Fung Wah Bus Transportation, between New York and Boston, and Eastern Bus, between New York and Philadelphia. At first, very few non-Chinese made use of the services. As word spread, they became popular with non-Chinese travelers due to lower fares and the demographics of these bus lines became similar to those of other intercity bus lines.

Competition and price wars between newly successful companies, combined with online ticket sales, led to a reduction in fares. Service to smaller cities by Chinatown bus lines had less of a price advantage. The fierce competition led to gang violence in which rival bus operators killed or injured each other. Because of their low fares, Chinatown bus lines had very low profit margins; some went bankrupt and ceased operations. However, the services became more popular and the number of trips by Chinatown bus lines increased.

In 2004, a fully-booked bus net at least $340 profit per round trip after expenses. In 2004, Vamoose Bus was launched by Hasidic Jews to compete with Chinatown bus lines.

By 2005, Chinatown buses appropriated much of the market share of Greyhound Lines in the Northeastern United States.

By 2006, many Chinatown bus lines operated service to/from casinos popular with Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants. All riders receive free-play vouchers, and some low-income or homeless people sell them before returning to New York.

In 2008, BoltBus was established by Greyhound to compete with the less-expensive Chinatown bus lines, but ceased operations in July 2021.

By 2010, service expanded to many major cities across the U.S.

By 2012, riders of Chinatown buses made up over half the ridership of northeastern intercity buses, bringing annual intercity ridership to over 7 million passengers.

===Shutdowns===

Double Happyness Travel, Inc. was shut down in December 2011 after it was called &quot;an imminent hazard&quot; by transportation officials.

On May 31, 2012, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced the shutdown of Apex Bus, I-95 Coach, New Century Travel, and 23 related entities due to safety violations.

On March 2, 2013, the United States Department of Transportation shut down Fung Wah Bus Transportation because of its refusal to provide safety records. The company was later authorized to resume its bus operations but shut down anyways in 2015.

On May 25, 2013, a bus operated by Lucky Star was taken out of service when a manhole cover became lodged in its undercarriage. The company was shut down on June 5 due to &quot;flagrant disregard for motor coach passenger safety&quot;. Lucky Star conducted an extensive bus upgrade and driver program, passed required inspections, and resumed operations in November 2013.

The shutdowns led to an increase in bus fares and some say the shutdowns were unnecessary. Jim Epstein, a writer for libertarian publication &quot;Reason&quot;, called the FMCSA practices overly harsh, writing that the agency targets Chinatown bus companies because owners are rarely fluent in English and alleging that inspectors were overly strict about defective components, confiscating several buses for minor issues.

===Post-shutdowns===
Despite these shutdowns, in 2015, Chinatown bus lines operated 5.3 million passenger trips and 48.5 million annual miles of service, up 14% from 2013 and up 26% since 2008.

In May 2019, Eastern Bus, a Chinatown bus line, reached a deal with Flixbus, in which Flixbus handles all marketing and sales for the company.

===Organized crime related incidents===

In 2003 and 2004, bus burnings, driver assaults, murders, and other gang violence in New York City were linked to the possible infiltration of Asian organized crime gangs in the industry.

Among the crimes associated with gang activity was a deadly shooting in May 2003 on a busy street, which may have been in retaliation for a driver backing his bus into a rival; in revenge, two buses were set on fire the following year. Fatal stabbings occurred in October 2003 and in 2004. The boyfriend of a bus-company employee was fatally shot in an apparent bus feud in January 2004, and a Chinatown bus operator was shot to death two months later. In a June 2004 incident tied to criminal gangs, two people—a Chinatown bus driver and a bystander—were murdered in a bar in Flushing, Queens; another was shot in the leg. The accused shooter was arrested in Toronto in 2011, and was extradited to the United States. After the 2004 shootings, the New York City Police Department increased its enforcement of Chinatown-bus laws. Bus-feud crime subsided by 2007.

In 2008, the Banya Organization, a Chinese gang, was accused of assaulting employees of Chinatown bus lines in an attempt to extort partial ownership and a share of the profits.

In 2013, police confiscated 254 guns and arrested 19 members of the largest gun-smuggling ring in New York City history; the suspects were accused of shipping guns via Chinatown bus lines. In 2020, Chinatown bus lines were again accused of being a conduit for gun trafficking.

===Safety record===
Chinatown buses have been involved in several incidents, and there were 34 intercity bus crashes across the United States from 2001 to 2011. On a 2006 safety scale of 0 to 100, where 0 was the safest and 100 the most dangerous, Chinatown bus lines were rated between 71 and 99; Greyhound was rated 0. &quot;Calculations of safety and risk are inverted,&quot; according to a 2013 City University of New York study. A report in 2011 found that curbside Chinatown buses were often more dangerous than buses that stop in terminals. As of 2011, many travelers were not discouraged. Intercity bus crashes are rare.

In February 2004, after several murders connected with employees of rival Chinatown bus companies, officials conducted a surprise inspection and seized buses.

In 2012, General Bus, a Chinatown bus line, was noted to have a safety record worse than 99.5% of other intercity bus lines.

In 2017, federal data showed that three Chinatown bus lines were among the worst safety violators among U.S. intercity bus lines.

====Crashes and incidents====
* February 8, 2003 A bus operated by Dahlia transporting passengers to the Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey, spun off the Garden State Parkway and flipped on its side on a snowy embankment, killing two people and injuring 28 people.
* March 18, 2005A Boston-bound Chinatown bus operated by Lucky Star/Travel Pack stopped and evacuated its passengers on the Massachusetts Turnpike shortly before it burst into flames. No one was injured.
* August 16, 2005A New York-bound bus operated by Fung Wah Bus Transportation caught fire on Interstate 91 near Meriden, Connecticut. Although the passengers later criticized the driver for being unhelpful and untrained in evacuating the bus, no injuries were reported. After the August 2005 bus fire, the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy began conducting three surprise inspections per month on all bus companies leaving Boston&#x27;s South Station terminal. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York proposed a four-point federal plan which would includes surprise inspections and a national safety standard for bus operators.
* August 15, 2006A Shun Fa bus traveling from New York to Pittsburgh crashed. Ten passengers were injured, five of whom were hospitalized, one in critical condition.
* September 6, 2006A bus operated by Fung Wah Bus Transportation rolled over in Auburn, Massachusetts, injuring 34 passengers. Excessive speed was cited as a factor and the bus company was fined.
* January 3, 2007A bus operated by Fung Wah Bus Transportation lost its back two wheels in Framingham, Massachusetts, early in a trip to New York. No injuries were reported.
* February 14, 2007A bus operated by Fung Wah Bus Transportation en route to New York went out of control and struck a traffic barrier on the Massachusetts Turnpike, I-90, in Allston. No injuries were reported. State officials had advised Fung Wah Bus Transportation to suspend operations because of a winter storm that day. Fung Wah reached an agreement with regulators in which its buses would be subject to inspections and driver checks for 30 days. The company agreed to improve safety, including removing unclean, unsafe buses from service.
* February 18, 2007A bus owned by Tremblay Motorcoach and operated by Sunshine Travel caught fire on the Massachusetts Turnpike near interchange 10A in Millbury, Massachusetts. All 50 passengers were evacuated, and no injuries were reported. The cause of the fire was unknown. The bus was returning to Chinatown, Boston from the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut.
* March 23, 2007A New York-bound bus operated by Fung Wah Bus Transportation from Boston got stuck on a cement lane divider at a tollbooth on the Massachusetts Turnpike at Massachusetts Route 128 in Weston, Massachusetts, when the driver tried to change lanes.

* May 20, 2007A New York-bound bus crashed in Pennsylvania, killing 2 riders and injuring 32 more.
* June 23, 2008A bus loading passengers was struck by an out-of-control dump truck at the intersection of Canal Street and the Bowery in New York&#x27;s Chinatown. The impact pushed the bus onto the sidewalk and into a bank. A sign attached to a light pole fell, injuring a 57-year-old woman who later died. Several people, including two police officers, were treated for minor injuries. State Department of Transportation inspectors found that the dump truck, owned by CPQ Freight Systems, had eight mechanical issues including faulty brakes which led to the crash.
* March 12, 2011 World Wide Tours bus crash - A bus operated by World Wide Tours traveling to Chinatown from the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut crashed, killing 15 people. The crash was a result of driver fatigue. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted.
* March 14, 2011On the New Jersey Turnpike, a bus crash killed the driver and injured 40, two critically. In March 2011, these two crashes led officials to confiscate six buses for inadequate brake air pressure, steering violations, and missing driver paperwork.
* May 31, 2011 A commercial tour bus operated by Sky Express crashed on Interstate 95, killing four people and injuring dozens.
* September 21, 2014A Chinatown bus overturned and killed two people and injured 48 people in Delaware.

* September 23, 2017A bus operated by Dahlia Group slammed into a city bus in Flushing, killing Dahlia’s driver, a city bus passenger, and a pedestrian, and injuring 16 people.
* January 5, 2020 A Chinatown bus crash killed five people and injured over 60 people on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

==Other criticism==
Buses often do not follow their scheduled timetables; many are unreliable, sometimes skipping scheduled stops. 

Buses are also criticized for being uncomfortable. Buses are generally older and unmarked. The buses are also known to break down.

The curbside bus stops used by Chinatown bus lines led to many complaints from nearby residents and business owners due to noise, pollution, trash, blocked traffic, and sidewalk overcrowding. The complaints led to increased regulations in several cities, including permit requirements, bus stop requirements, fines and fees, as well as the construction of the Independence Transportation Center in Philadelphia. These regulations were also allegedly influenced by Peter Pan Bus Lines and Greyhound Lines, which face competition from Chinatown bus lines.

<text>The Niagara campaign occurred in 1814 and was the final campaign launched by the United States to invade Canada during the War of 1812. The campaign was launched to counter the British offensive in the Niagara region which had been initiated with the capture of Fort Niagara in December, 1813. As part of that campaign, and in response to the American burning of the village of Newark on the Canadian side of the river, British forces and their native allies burned the American villages of Buffalo and Black Rock. 

Having rejected the option of attacking the British naval base at Kingston in Upper Canada (as it was considered too logistically difficult and well defended), the American objective in the 1814 campaign was to deal the British a decisive blow on the Niagara peninsula. The American forces, commanded by General Jacob Brown and General Winfield Scott, began their counter campaign with the Capture of Fort Erie on the Niagara Peninsula early in July. 
Next, they defeated the British at the Battle of Chippawa.

At the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane three weeks later, both sides claimed victory, but because U.S. forces had suffered so many casualties, they pulled back to Fort Erie. Following their return to the fort, the British, under Gordon Drummond, attempted to capture the fort and the Siege of Fort Erie followed. The Americans were able to hold out, and the British eventually lifted the siege after suffering severe losses. After a small engagement at Cook&#x27;s Mills, American forces, commanded by General George Izard, abandoned Fort Erie and returned to the U.S. territory for winter quarters. In February 1815 the U.S. Senate approved the Treaty of Ghent ending the war.

<text>Lalibela () is a town in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located in the Lasta district and North Wollo Zone, it is a tourist site for its famous rock-cut monolithic churches designed in contrast to the earlier monolithic churches in Ethiopia. The whole of Lalibela is a large and important site for the antiquity, medieval, and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia. To Christians, Lalibela is one of Ethiopia&#x27;s holiest cities, and a center of pilgrimage. 

Ethiopia was one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the 4th century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles. The churches themselves date from the 7th to 13th centuries, and are traditionally dated to the reign of the Zagwe (Agaw) king Gebre Meskel Lalibela (r. ).

The layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are widely accepted, especially by local clergy, to be a symbolic representation of Jerusalem. This has led some experts to date the current church construction to the years following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by the Muslim leader Saladin.

Lalibela is roughly above sea level. It is the main town in Lasta, which was formerly part of the Bugna district. The rock-hewn churches were declared a World Heritage Site in 1978.

==History==
===Origins===
There is some controversy as to when some of the churches were constructed. According to local tradition, in Ethiopia prior to his accession to the throne, Gebre Meskel Lalibela was guided by Christ on a tour of Jerusalem, and instructed to build a second Jerusalem in Ethiopia. Accordingly Lalibela (traditionally known as Roha) was founded during the Zagwe dynasty, under the rule of King Gebre Meskel Lalibela (r. ca. 1181–1221 AD), although it is more likely that the churches evolved into their current form over the course of several phases of construction and alteration of preexisting structures. David Buxton established the generally accepted chronology, noting that &quot;two of them follow, with great fidelity of detail, the tradition represented by Debra Damo as modified at Yemrahana Kristos.&quot; Since the time spent to carve these structures from the living rock must have taken longer than the few decades of reign of Gebre Meskel Lalibela, Buxton assumes that the work extended into the 14th century. However, David Phillipson, professor of African archeology at University of Cambridge, has proposed that the churches of Merkorios, Gabriel-Rufael, and Danagel were initially carved out of the rock half a millennium earlier, as fortifications or other palace structures between 600 and 800 A.D, during the days of the Kingdom of Aksum, and that Lalibela&#x27;s name simply came to be associated with them after his death. On the other hand, local historian Getachew Mekonnen credits Meskel Kibra, Lalibela&#x27;s wife, with having one of the rock-hewn churches, Biete Abba Libanos, built as a memorial for her husband after his death.

Recent archeological excavations of Lalibela finds abundant pottery and faunal remains dating between 900 A.D and 1100 A.D, which indicates that the site was largely a secular settlement before being transformed into a religious center by King Lalibela. Pre-Christian carved animal friezes were also found on the lower walls of the nearby Washa Mika&#x27;el cave and Christian paintings were subsequently added on to the upper walls, suggesting that this region was still going through a process of Christianization during this time.

===15th century===
Its name was first used in a European publication in Fra Mauro map made in Venice 1457-59, written as &quot;Lalabeda&quot;.
===16th century===
A Portuguese priest, Francisco Álvares (1465–1540), accompanied the Portuguese Ambassador on a visit to Dawit II in the 1520s. After Alvares described the unique church structures he wrote: &quot;I weary of writing more about these buildings, because it seems to me that I shall not be believed if I write more because as to what I have already written they may accuse me of untruth, therefore I swear by God, in whose power I am, that all that is written is the truth, and there is much more than what I have written, and I have left it that they may not tax me with its being falsehood. And because no other Portuguese went to these works except myself, and I went twice to see them from what I had heard of them. I swear by God, in Whose power I am, that all I have written is the truth&quot;. Although Ramuso included the plans of several of these churches in his 1550 printing of Álvares&#x27; book, it is unknown who provided him with the drawings. 
According to the &quot;Futuh al-Habaša&quot; of Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi burned one of the churches of Lalibela during his invasion of Ethiopia. Sihab ad-Din Ahmad (Arab Faqih) provided a detailed description of a rock-hewn church &quot;It was carved out of the mountain. Its pillars were likewise cut from the mountain.&quot; Ahmed then gathered the monks of Lalibela and had a fire lit in the church, saying to them &quot;let one of yours and one of ours enter there&quot;. A nun then threw herself onto the fire before being pulled out by Ahmad&#x27;s soldiers. However, Richard Pankhurst has expressed skepticism about this, pointing out that the &quot;Royal Chronicles&quot;, which mention Ahmad al-Ghazi&#x27;s laying waste to the district between July and September 1531, are silent about him ravaging the churches. He concludes by stating that had Ahmad al-Ghazi burned a church at Lalibela, it was most likely Biete Medhane Alem; and if the Adalites was either mistaken or misled by the locals, then the church he set fire to was Gannata Maryam, &quot;10 miles [16 km] east of Lalibela which likewise has a colonnade of pillars cut from the mountain.&quot;

The next reported visitor to Lalibela was Miguel de Castanhoso, who was a soldier under Cristóvão da Gama and left Ethiopia in 1544. Castanhoso states: &quot;There are here certain churches cut out of the living rock, which are attributed to angels. Indeed, the work appears superhuman, because, though they are of the size of the large ones in this country, they are each excavated with its pillars, its altars, and its vaults, out of a single rock, with no mixture of any outside stone. When the Moors overran this country they wished to destroy these churches, but could not either with crowbars, or with the gunpowder which they exploded in them, doing no damage at all.&quot; 

===19th century===
In 1882, French explorer Achille Raffray was given an Ethiopian manuscript at Lalibela, which adds that the King Lalibela and his wife Meskal-Kebra brought from Alexandria (Egypt) and Jerusalem about five hundred workers whom we still refer to them as Europeans, headed by someone named Sidi-Meskal. However, according to Monti della Corte (1940) Raffray&#x27;s translation of the three-language manuscript was almost completely incorrect. Utilizing the expertise of A. Van Lantschoot at the Biblioteca Vaticana, the discrepancies were clarified. The first text, written in Coptic (contrary to Raffray&#x27;s assertion of Greek), is a brief statement attributed to Abuna Bartolomeo, dated during the reign of Dawit (1380-1409). The second text, in Arabic, is serves as a land charter confirming specific rights of the church. The third text, in Ge&#x27;ez, appears to have been written during the reign of Lebna Dengel (1508-1540). Contrary to Raffray&#x27;s claims, there is no mention of Sidi-Maskal or foreign builders in the texts.

===20th century===
During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Haile Selassie made a pilgrimage to the churches at Lalibela, at considerable risk of capture, before returning to his capital in April 1936. Italian forces captured the town shortly after.

In 1968, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi accompanied by Emperor Haile Selassie visited the churches, the next year Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard would also visit Lalibela.
During the Ethiopian Civil War, the town was the target of frequent attacks by the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (EPDM), in 1984 they briefly held ten foreigners captive. On March 3 1985 they briefly captured the crew of a French transport aircraft carrying supplies before releasing them a couple days later. These attacks significantly reduced foreign tourism to Lalibela, and by 1990 most of the tourists were Ethiopians.

===21st century===

In early August 2021, Tigrayan Defense Force fighters captured the town during the Tigray War as a response to the invasion of Amhara forces into the Tigray region. On 1 December 2021, the Ethiopian army recaptured the town. The town was recaptured again by Tigrayan forces on 12 December. On 19 December, Ethiopian state media announced the town was recaptured for a second time, though it was unclear when.

In early November 2023, Lalibela was the site of fierce fighting between the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) and Fano fighters. The town is currently under Ethiopian government control.

==Architecture==
The architecture of the churches contain significant Aksumite influences, as Stuart Munro-Hay notes that the church of Biete Amanuel displays a stone imitation of wooden architectural features, which can still be seen in some of the ancient churches of Tigray and Eritrea. The framed doors and windows appear as a repeated motif, since they seem to mimic the shape of stelae in Aksum, examples can be seen in the arcading of Biete Gabriel-Rufael, the doorway of Biete Maryam and the windows of Biete Amanuel. However, according to David Phillipson the presence of Aksumite style architecture does not necessarily imply that the churches were constructed during the Aksumite era, as Aksumite features could have been incorporated long after the fall of Aksum, but it does indicate a strong continuity with Aksumite cultural tradition. There is also signs of eastern Christian influences, particularly Syrian and Coptic. The pitched roof and linear moldings of Biete Maryam suggests a Syrian influence. Stuart Munro-Hay notes that during the reign of Gebre Meskel Lalibela, many Coptic Egyptians emigrated to Ethiopia and may have assisted in construction of the churches, or at least those that date to his reign. Many foreign travelers such as Manuel de Almeida and Hiob Ludolf credited most of the monuments to Egyptian architects, with Francisco Álvares finding that many locals considered the churches to be mainly the work of foreigners. However, Stuart Munro-Hay argues that since the architecture of the churches were built in the Aksumite style, the foreign influence seems to have largely been limited to &quot;decorative techniques&quot;. David Buxton further attests to this by pointing out that &quot;there are clearly signs of Coptic influence in some decorative details&quot;, however he is adamant about the native origins of these churches: &quot;But the significant fact is remains that the rock-churches continue to follow the style of the local built-up prototypes, which themselves retain clear evidence of their basically Axumite origin.&quot;

In a 1970 report of the historic dwellings of Lalibela, Sandro Angelini evaluated the vernacular earthen architecture on the Lalibela World Heritage Site, including the characteristics of the traditional earth houses and analysis of their state of conservation. His report described two types of vernacular housing found in the area. One type are a group he calls the &quot;tukuls&quot;, round huts built of stone and usually having two stories. The second are the single-story &quot;chika&quot; buildings which are round and built of earth and wattle, which he feels reflects more &quot;scarcity&quot;. Angel&#x27;s report also included an inventory of Lalibela&#x27;s traditional buildings, placing them in categories rating their state of conservation.

==Churches==


This rural town is known around the world for its churches carved from within the earth from &quot;living rock,&quot; which play an important part in the history of rock-cut architecture. Though the dating of the churches is not well established, most are thought to have been built during the reign of Lalibela, namely during the 12th and 13th centuries. Unesco identifies 11 churches, assembled in four groups:

The Northern Group: 
*Biete Medhane Alem (House of the Saviour of the World), home to the Lalibela Cross. 
*Biete Maryam (House of Miriam/House of Mary), possibly the oldest of the churches, and a replica of the Tombs of Adam and Christ. 
* (House of Golgotha Mikael), known for its arts and said to contain the tomb of King Lalibela)
*Biete Meskel (House of the Cross)
*Biete Denagel (House of Virgins)

The Western Group: 
*Church of Saint George, thought to be the most finely executed and best preserved church

The Eastern Group: 
*Biete Amanuel (House of Immanuel), possibly the former royal chapel. 
*Biete Qeddus Mercoreus (House of Saint Mercurius/House of Mark the Evangelist), which may be a former prison
*Biete Abba Libanos (House of Abbot Libanos) 
*Biete Gabriel-Rufael (House of the angels Gabriel, and Raphael) possibly a former royal palace, linked to a holy bakery.
*Biete Lehem (&quot;Bethlehem&quot;, &quot;House of Bread&quot;).

Farther afield, lie the monastery of Ashetan Maryam and Yemrehana Krestos Church (possibly eleventh century, built in the Aksumite fashion, but within a cave).

The churches are also a significant engineering feat, given that they are all associated with water (which fills the wells next to many of the churches), exploiting an artesian geological system that brings the water up to the top of the mountain ridge on which the city rests.

==Other features==
Lalibela is also home to an airport (ICAO code HALL, IATA LLI), a large market, two schools, and a hospital.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2007 Census Data, the population was 17,367, of whom 8,112 were males and 9,255 were females. Based on previous figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, the town had an estimated total population of 14,668 of whom 7,049 were males and 7,619 were females. The 1994 national census recorded its population to be 8,484 of whom 3,709 were males and 4,775 were females.

<doc id="518155" wikidata="Q92874" url="?curid=518155" title="Ken Sakamura">
<text>, as of April 2017, is a Japanese professor and dean of the Faculty of Information Networking for Innovation and Design at Toyo University, Japan. He is a former professor in information science at the University of Tokyo (through March 2017). He is the creator of the real-time operating system (RTOS) architecture TRON.

In 2001, he shared the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Well-Being with Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds.

==Career==
As of 2006, Sakamura leads the ubiquitous networking laboratory (UNL), located in Gotanda, Tokyo, and the T-Engine forum for consumer electronics. The joint goal of Sakamura&#x27;s ubiquitous networking specification and the T-Engine forum, is to enable any everyday device to broadcast and receive information. It is essentially a TRON variant, paired with a competing standard to radio-frequency identification (RFID).

Since the foundation of the T-Engine forum, Sakamura has been working on opening Japanese technology to the world. His prior brainchild, TRON, the universal RTOS used in Japanese consumer electronics has had limited adoption in other countries. Sakamura has signed deals with Chinese and Korean universities to work together on ubiquitous networking. He has also worked with French software component manufacturer NexWave Solutions, Inc. He is an external board member for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), Japan.

==Ubiquitous Communicator==
The &quot;Ubiquitous Communicator&quot; (&quot;UC&quot;) is a mobile computing device designed by Sakamura for use in ubiquitous computing. On 15 September 2004, YRP-UNL announced in Japan that it had begun producing a new model after creating five prototypes over three years. The model was used in trial tests circa late 2004. The new model, weighing about 196 grams, contains new features: RFID reader compatible for ucode, a two megapixel charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, a secondary 300,000 pixel camera for videotelephony, support for wireless network technologies, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and IrDA, VoIP phone feature, SD and mini-SD memory card slots, fingerprint authentication, and encryption coprocessor as options. It was expected to be sold for ¥300,000, $2,700.

==Honors==
In May 2015, Sakamura received the prestigious ITU150 award from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), along with Bill Gates, Robert E. Kahn, Thomas Wiegand, Mark I. Krivosheyev, and Martin Cooper. The following is the citation given by ITU:
... Today, the real-time operating systems based on the TRON specifications are used for engine control on automobiles, mobile phones, digital cameras, and many other appliances, and are believed to be the among most popular operating systems for embedded computers around world. The R&amp;D results from TRON Project are useful for ubiquitous computing. For example, UNL joined the standardization efforts at ITU-T and helped produce a series of Recommendations, including H.642 “Multimedia information access triggered by tag-based identification”. The idea behind H.642 series is based on de facto “ucode” standard developed by UNL for communication in the age of the Internet of Things ... For his achievements, Sakamura has won many awards: Takeda Award, the Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Japanese government, Okawa Prize, Prime Minister Award, and Japan Academy Prize. He is a fellow and the golden core member of the IEEE Computer Society.

<doc id="518156" wikidata="Q1318527" url="?curid=518156" title="Kaori Mochida">
<text>is the lead singer of Japanese pop group Every Little Thing.

== Biography ==
Mochida began her career as a child actress, appearing in magazines and TV commercials. She then became a member of the second generation of idol group The Kuro Buta All-Stars, and entered the entertainment world as (Kaori Mochida, with &quot;Kaori&quot; written in &quot;hiragana&quot;). Shortly after, she released her first single as a solo artist, titled &quot;Mō Ichido&quot; in November 1993. She didn&#x27;t decide to become a singer professionally until she was in high school.

In 1995, she met Mitsuru Igarashi, and signed to the Avex label. At first she was meant to debut as a solo artist, but as Max Matsuura suggested, she then formed a duo with Igarashi, and then a trio when Ichiro Ito was incorporated as a guitarist. They debuted in 1996 with &quot;Feel My Heart&quot;. Following her debut with Every Little Thing, Mochida became a popular fashion icon in Japan, and started to appear in TV commercials for a wide variety of beauty products. The spots that she starred in usually used the songs of her band as background music. After the departure of Mitsuru Igarashi from Every Little Thing in 2000, Mochida started to take more control in the music making process, and soon started to write her own songs. The first song for Every Little Thing that she wrote lyrics for was &quot;All along&quot; included in the &quot;Time to Destination&quot; album, and the first song she composed was &quot;Jump&quot;, released as a single in 2001.

She did not release any solo music until 2002, when she participated in the Avex charity project &quot;Song+Nation&quot;, where she recorded the song &quot;In Case of Me&quot;, produced by Tetsuya Komuro. In 2004, she released &quot;Itsunomanika Shōjo wa&quot;, a cover single of Yosui Inoue which was produced by the musician himself. In 2006, she wrote Haruka Ayase&#x27;s debut single &quot;Period&quot; along with Takeshi Kobayashi, and in 2007, she wrote &quot;Sarai no Kaze&quot; for May and &quot;Going Back Home&quot; for Mika Nakashima. This year she also provided vocals for Dragon Ash&#x27;s song &quot;Wipe Your Eyes&quot;, song that also had a promotional video despite not being released as a single.

In 2009, Kaori Mochida&#x27;s solo career officially started, and she started to work on her first solo album. She released her first official solo single, &quot;Ame no Walts&quot;, on January 28, 2009. The song was credited as a collaboration between Mochida and Sakerock, a Japanese instrumental band. In March she and Takao Tajima from Original Love formed a special group called Caocao, and recorded a cover of &quot;Kojin Jugyo&quot; by Finger 5. The song was used as theme song for the movie &quot;Oppai Volleyball&quot;. In July she released a double A-side single entitled &quot;Shizuka na Yoru/Weather&quot;, and a month later, on August 12, she released her first solo album, &quot;Moka&quot;. The album featured collaborations with several artists, such as Lisa Ono, Ikuko Harada, Yuichi Ohata, Bic Runga, ohashiTrio, and Sean Lennon. It debuted at number 9 in the Oricon charts and enjoyed moderated success.

On August 25, 2009, her second album, &quot;Niu&quot;, was released. The album had no commercial singles, except for a CD single of &quot;Green&quot;, that was included in a special edition of fashion magazine &quot;Journal Standard&quot;. For this album she made her first domestic solo tour between September and October.

On August 1, 2012, her third solo album &quot;Manu a Manu&quot; was released. The song &quot;Utsukushiki Uruwashiki Hibi&quot;, which was released as single from the album in June 2012, was used as theme song for TV Tokyo drama &quot;Cleopatra na Onna-tachi&quot;, which started airing in April of the same year.

<text>Ying Chen (; born February 20, 1961) is a Chinese Canadian author. She writes mostly in French and also translates her own works into Chinese and English.

==Biography==
Born in 1961 in Shanghai, she now lives in Vancouver and is the mother of two children. She obtained a degree in French language and literature from Fudan University (复旦大学) in 1983 and worked as a translator and interpreter before moving to Montreal in 1989. She later lived in Magog, Quebec before moving to Vancouver in 2003.

Ying Chen&#x27;s novels include &quot;La mémoire de l&#x27;eau&quot;, &quot;Les lettres chinoises&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;ingratitude&quot; (which won the Prix Québec-Paris, and was published in the U.S. as &quot;Ingratitude,&quot; translated by Carol Volk, and published in China as &quot;再见妈妈&quot;, self-translated), &quot;Immobile&quot; (which won the Prix Alfred-DesRochers), &quot;Le champ dans la mer&quot; (published in China as &quot;V家花园&quot;, self-translated), &quot;Querelle d&#x27;un squelette avec son double&quot; (self-translated and published on Amazon as &quot;Skeleton and its double&quot;), &quot;Le Mangeur&quot;, &quot;Un Enfant à ma porte&quot;, &quot;Espèces&quot;, &quot;La Rive est loin&quot;. She wrote two books of essays: &quot;Quatre mille marches&quot; and &quot;La Lenteur des montagnes&quot;. She practices a lean, polished and deceptively simple writing style, free of flourishes and excess verbiage. As a child, one of her schoolteachers once told her &quot;the most simple is the most beautiful&quot;, and she has retained this idea.

<doc id="518160" wikidata="Q1409224" url="?curid=518160" title="D'oh!">
<text>&quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; () is the most famous catchphrase used by the fictional character Homer Simpson, from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, an animated sitcom. It is an exclamation typically used after Homer injures himself, realizes that he has done something foolish, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. All his prominent blood relations—son Bart, daughters Lisa and Maggie, his father, his mother and half-brother—have also been heard to use it themselves in similar circumstances. On a few occasions, Homer&#x27;s wife Marge and characters outside the family such as Mr. Burns and Sideshow Bob have also used this phrase.

In 2006, &quot;d&#x27;oh!&quot; was listed as number six on TV Land&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases. The spoken word &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot; is claimed as a sound trademark by the owner of &quot;the Simpsons&quot;, 20th Century Studios. Since 2001, the word &quot;doh&quot; has appeared in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, without the apostrophe. Early recorded usages of the sound &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot; are in numerous episodes of the BBC Radio series &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; between 1945 and 1949, but the &quot;OxfordWords&quot; blog notes &quot;Homer was responsible for popularizing it as an exclamation of frustration.&quot; The term also appeared in an early issue of &quot;Mad&quot; comics, with a different spelling but the same meaning, in issue 8 (December 1953 – January 1954); in a one-page story by Harvey Kurtzman entitled &quot;Hey Look!&quot;, a man seeking peace and quiet suddenly hears a loud radio and, grimacing, says, &quot;D-oooh – the neighbors radio!!&quot;

==Origin==
Several decades before &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was aired, the exclamation &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; was used in the BBC radio comedy program, &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;, which ran from 1939 to 1949. It was the catchphrase of the formidable, but soft-hearted, character, &quot;Miss Hotchkiss&quot;.

During the voice recording session for a &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an &quot;annoyed grunt&quot;. Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out &quot;d&#x27;ooooooh&quot;. This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, who had used the term in his first sound film role, in 1929&#x27;s &quot;Men O&#x27; War&quot;, as a minced oath for suggesting the word &quot;damn!&quot; without actually saying it. The mustachioed Scottish actor (acknowledged by Dan Castellaneta as the progenitor for Homer Simpson&#x27;s similar expression of disbelief or outrage) would go on to appear in 33 Laurel and Hardy films, from the pre-sound era up to 1940. Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered &quot;d&#x27;oh!&quot; The first intentional use of &quot;d&#x27;oh!&quot; occurred in the &quot;Ullman&quot; short &quot;Punching Bag&quot; (1988), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. It is typically represented in the show&#x27;s script as &quot;(annoyed grunt)&quot;, and is so spelled out in the official titles of several episodes. Some episodes feature variations of the word such as &quot;Bart of Darkness&quot; (season six, 1994), where Homer says &quot;D&#x27;oheth&quot; after an Amish farmer points out to him that he has built a barn instead of the swimming pool he was intending; &quot;Thirty Minutes over Tokyo&quot; (season ten, 1999), where Homer says &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot; in Japanese (with English subtitles, the spoken phrase being &quot;shimatta baka ni&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;damn folly&quot;); or &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007) where Homer bellows &quot;d&#x27;oh-ome!&quot; after the EPA seals the Simpsons&#x27; hometown, Springfield, in a giant dome. The spelling is made official in &quot;El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)&quot; (season eight, 1997), in which Homer, after having eaten a very spicy chili, hallucinates about a tortoise and exclaims a loud &quot;d&#x27;oh!&quot; as he realizes that he needs to follow the slow animal in order to find out about his soul mate.

==Episode names==
As the word arose out of Castellaneta&#x27;s interpretation of a non-specific direction, it did not have an official spelling for several years. Instead, it was always written in Simpsons scripts as &quot;(Annoyed Grunt)&quot;, and then later on being spelled &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot;, as it remains today.

==Dictionary==
The term &quot;d&#x27;oh!&quot; has been used or adopted by many &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans as well as non-fans. The term has become commonplace in modern speech and demonstrates the extent of the show&#x27;s influence. &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; was first added to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; in 1998 as an interjection with the definition &quot;(usually [in a manner] mildly derogatory) used to comment on an action perceived as foolish or stupid.&quot;

In 2001, the word &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot; was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;; The definition given is:
:&quot;Expressing frustration at the realisation that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish. Also (usu. mildly &quot;derogatory&quot;): implying that another person has said or done something foolish&quot; (cf. ).
The headword spelling is &quot;doh&quot;, but &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot; is listed as a variant (as is &quot;dooh&quot;). The etymology section notes &quot;the word appears (in the form &quot;D&#x27;oh&quot;) in numerous publications based on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&quot;. Eight quotations featuring the sound &quot;d&#x27;oh&quot; are cited: the earliest is from a 1945 episode of the BBC radio series &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;; two others are &quot;Simpsons&quot;-related.

<text>Sally Mann (born Sally Turner Munger; May 1, 1951) is an American photographer known for making large format black and white photographs of people and places in her immediate surroundings: her children, husband, and rural landscapes, as well as self-portraits.

==Early life and education==
Born in Lexington, Virginia, Mann was the third of three children. Her father, Robert S. Munger, was a general practitioner, and her mother, Elizabeth Evans Munger, ran the bookstore at Washington and Lee University in Lexington. Mann was introduced to photography by her father, who encouraged her interest; his 5x7 camera became the basis of her use of large format cameras today. Mann began to photograph when she was sixteen. 

Most of her photographs and writings are tied to Lexington, Virginia. Mann graduated from The Putney School in 1969, and attended Bennington College and Friends World College. She earned a BA, summa cum laude, from Hollins College (now Hollins University) in 1974 and a MA in creative writing in 1975.
She took up photography at Putney where, she has said, her motive was to be alone in the darkroom with her boyfriend. Mann has never had any formal training in photography and she &quot;never read[s] about photography&quot;.

==Early career==
After graduation from Hollins College, Mann worked as a photographer at Washington and Lee University. In the mid-1970s she photographed the construction of its new law school building, the Lewis Hall (now the Sydney Lewis Hall). These photographs were the basis of her first solo exhibition in late 1977 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. The Corcoran Gallery of Art published a catalogue of Mann&#x27;s images titled &quot;The Lewis Law Portfolio&quot;. Some of images had a surreal aspect; they were also included as part of her first book, &quot;Second Sight&quot;, published in 1984. 

While Mann explored a variety of genres as she was maturing in the 1970s, she truly found her trade with her book, &quot;At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women&quot; (Aperture, 1988).
In 1995, she was featured in an issue of &quot;Aperture&quot;: &quot;On Location with: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Graciela Iturbide, Barbara Kruger, Sally Mann, Andres Serrano, Clarissa Sligh&quot; which was illustrated with photographs.

===&quot;At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women&quot;===
 
Her second collection, &quot;At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women&quot;, published in 1988, stimulated minor controversy. The images &quot;captured the confusing emotions and developing identities of adolescent girls [and the] expressive printing style lent a dramatic and brooding mood to all of her images&quot;. In the preface to the book, author Ann Beattie wrote &quot;when a girl is twelve years old, she often wants – or says she wants – less involvement with adults. […] [it is] a time in which the girls yearn for freedom and adults feel their own grip on things becoming a little tenuous, as they realize that they have to let their children go.&quot; Beattie says that Mann&#x27;s photographs don&#x27;t &quot;glamorize the world, but they don&#x27;t make it into something more unpleasant than it is, either&quot;. The girls photographed in this series are shown &quot;vulnerable in their youthfulness&quot; but Mann focuses on the strength that the girls possess.
Referring to &quot;Untitled&quot;, an image from the book shown here, Mann says that the young girl was extremely reluctant to stand closer to her mother&#x27;s boyfriend. Mann said that she thought it was strange because &quot;it was their peculiar familiarity that had provoked this photograph in the first place&quot;. Mann didn&#x27;t want to crop out the girl&#x27;s elbow but the girl refused to move in closer. According to Mann, several months later, the girl&#x27;s mother shot her boyfriend in the face with a .22. In court the mother &quot;testified that while she worked nights at a local truck stop he was ‘at home partying and harassing my daughter.&#x27;&quot; Mann said &quot;the child put it to me somewhat more directly&quot;. Mann says that she now looks at this photograph with &quot;a jaggy chill of realization&quot;.

===&quot;Immediate Family&quot; and controversy===

Mann became widely known for &quot;Immediate Family&quot;, her third collection, first exhibited in 1990 by Edwynn Houk Gallery in New York City and published as a monograph in 1992. In a cover story for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Richard B. Woodward wrote that &quot;probably no photographer in history has enjoyed such a burst of success in the art world&quot;. The article detailed a federal prosecutor having informed Mann that “no fewer than eight pictures she had chosen for the traveling exhibition [“Immediate Family”] could subject her to arrest.”

&quot;Immediate Family&quot; appeared at a time when politicians were cracking down on even the suspicion of child pornography to appeal to their constituents, forcing artists to justify their work, and leading many to self-censor. According to writer Bruce Handy, the Christian right conflated naturalistic nudes of children by Mann and Jock Sturges with sexualized images by photographers such as David Hamilton. 

Mann considered these photographs to be &quot;natural through the eyes of a mother, since she has seen her children in every state: happy, sad, playful, sick, bloodied, angry and &quot;even&quot; naked&quot;. Deborah Chambers, in her work on family photo albums, reflects on their idyllic nature but also argues they rarely convey the actual experience of the family. Mann&#x27;s work takes these idyllic photos meant for semi-private consumption and brings them to the public sphere. By working collaboratively with her children, Mann uses these idealised family photos to create a narrative from her children&#x27;s perspectives. Critics agreed, saying her &quot;vision in large measure [is] accurate, and a welcome corrective to familiar notions of youth as a time of unalloyed sweetness and innocence&quot;. They said that the book &quot;created a place that looked like Eden, then cast upon it the subdued and shifting light of nostalgia, sexuality and death&quot;. 

When &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her &quot;America&#x27;s Best Photographer&quot; in 2001, it wrote:

Mann recorded a combination of spontaneous and carefully arranged moments of childhood repose and revealingly — sometimes unnervingly — imaginative play. What the outraged critics of her child nudes failed to grant was the patent devotion involved throughout the project and the delighted complicity of her son and daughters in so many of the solemn or playful events. No other collection of family photographs is remotely like it, in both its naked candor and the fervor of its maternal curiosity and care.

Dr. Aaron Esman, a child psychiatrist at the Payne Whitney Clinic believes that Mann is serious about her work and that she has &quot;no intention to jeopardize her children or use them for pornographic images&quot;. He says that the nude photographs don&#x27;t appear to be erotically stimulating to anyone but a &quot;case-hardened pedophile or a rather dogmatic religious fundamentalist&quot;. Mann stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect the controversy over the pictures of my children. I was just a mother photographing her children as they were growing up. I was exploring different subjects with them.&quot;

==Later career==
Mann&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;Still Time&quot;, published in 1994, was based on the catalogue of a traveling exhibition that included more than 20 years of her photography. The 60 images included more photographs of her children, but also earlier landscapes with color and abstract photographs.

In the mid-1990s, Mann began photographing landscapes on wet plate collodion 8x10 inch glass negatives, and used the same 100-year-old 8x10 format bellows view camera that she had used for all the previous bodies of work. These landscapes were first seen in &quot;Still Time&quot;, and later featured in two shows presented by the Edwynn Houk Gallery in NYC: &quot;Sally Mann – Mother Land: Recent Landscapes of Georgia and Virginia&quot; in 1997, and then in &quot;Deep South: Landscapes of Louisiana and Mississippi&quot; in 1999. Many of these large (40&quot;x50&quot;) black-and-white and manipulated prints were taken using the 19th century &quot;wet plate&quot; process, or collodion, in which glass plates are coated with collodion, dipped in silver nitrate, and exposed while still wet. This gave the photographs what the &quot;New York Times&quot; called &quot;a swirling, ethereal image with a center of preternatural clarity&quot;, and showed many flaws and artifacts, some from the process and some introduced by Mann.
Mann has been the subject of two film documentaries. The first, &quot;Blood Ties&quot; (1994). Directed by Steve Cantor and Peter Spirer, it debuted at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival. It was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Documentary Short. 

The second, &quot;What Remains: The Life and Work of Sally Mann&quot; (2005) was also directed by Steve Cantor. It premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Emmy for Best Documentary in 2008. In her &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the film, Ginia Bellafante wrote, &quot;It is one of the most exquisitely intimate portraits not only of an artist&#x27;s process, but also of a marriage and a life, to appear on television in recent memory.&quot;
Mann uses antique view cameras from the early 1890s. These cameras have wooden frames, accordion-like bellows and long lenses made out of brass, now held together by tape that has mold growing inside. This sort of camera, when used with vintage lenses, softens the light.
A self-portrait (which also included her two daughters) was featured on the September 9, 2001 cover of &quot;The New York Times Magazine,&quot; for a theme issue on &quot;Women Looking at Women&quot;.
Mann&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;What Remains&quot;, published in 2003, is based on the show of the same name at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC. The book is broken up into four sections: Matter Lent, December 8, 2000; Antietam, and What Remains. The first section contains photographs of the remains of Eva, her greyhound, after decomposition, along with photographs of dead and decomposing bodies at a federal forensic anthropology facility (known as the &#x27;body farm&#x27;). The &#x27;body farm&#x27; was another series (in addition to those about her family) that was controversial. 

The second part details the site on her property where an armed escaped convict was killed in a shootout with police. The third part is a study of the grounds of Antietam, the site of the bloodiest single day battle in American history during the Civil War. The fourth part is a study of close-up faces of her children.
Mann&#x27;s sixth book, &quot;Deep South&quot;, published in 2005, with 65 black-and-white images, includes landscapes taken from 1992 to 2004 using both conventional 8x10 film and wet plate collodion. These photographs have been described as &quot;haunted landscapes of the south, battlefields, decaying mansion, kudzu shrouded landscapes and the site where Emmett Till was murdered&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; picked it as their book choice for the holiday season, saying that Mann &quot;walks right up to every Southern stereotype in the book and subtly demolishes each in its turn by creating indelibly disturbing images that hover somewhere between document and dream&quot;.
Mann&#x27;s seventh book, &quot;Proud Flesh&quot;, published in 2009, is a study taken over six years of the effects of muscular dystrophy on her husband Larry Mann. Mann photographed her husband using the collodion wet plate process As she notes, &quot;The results of this rare reversal of photographic roles are candid, extraordinarily wrenching and touchingly frank portraits of a man at his most vulnerable moment.&quot; The project was displayed in Gagosian Gallery in October 2009.
Mann&#x27;s eighth book, &quot;The Flesh and The Spirit&quot;, published in 2010, was released in conjunction with a comprehensive show at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia. Regarding this exhibition, the museum director stated, &quot;She follows her own voice. Her pictures are imbued with an amazing degree of soul.&quot; Though not strictly a retrospective, this 200-page book included new and recent work (unpublished self-portraits, landscapes, images of her husband, her children&#x27;s faces, and of the dead at a forensic institute) as well as early works (unpublished color photographs of her children in the 1990s, color Polaroids, and platinum prints from the 1970s). Its unifying theme is the body, with its vagaries of illnesses and death. It includes essays by John Ravenal, David Levi Strauss, and Anne Wilkes Tucker.
In May 2011 Mann delivered the three-day Massey Lecture Series at Harvard, speaking about how her extended family influenced her work. Her memoir &quot;Hold Still&quot; arose as a companion to the lecture. In June 2011, Mann sat down with one of her contemporaries, Nan Goldin, at Look3 Charlottesville Festival of the Photograph. The two photographers discussed their respective careers, particularly the ways in which photographing personal lives became a source of professional controversy. This was followed by an appearance at the University of Michigan as part of the Penny W. Stamps lecture series.
Mann&#x27;s ninth book, &quot;Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs&quot;, released May 12, 2015, is a melding of a memoir of her youth, an examination of some major influences of her life, and reflections on how photography shapes one&#x27;s view of the world. It is augmented with numerous photographs, letters, and other memorabilia. She singles out her &quot;near-feral&quot; childhood and her subsequent introduction to photography at Putney, her relationship to her husband of 40 years and his parents&#x27; mysterious death, and her maternal Welsh relative&#x27;s nostalgia for land, background to her own love for her land in the Shenandoah Valley, as some of her important influences. She also assesses Gee-Gee, a black woman who was like a parent to her, who opened Mann&#x27;s eyes to race relations and exploitation; her relationship with local artist Cy Twombly, and her father&#x27;s genteel southern legacy and his eventual death. She ponders the relationship Robert S. Munger, her great-grandfather and southern industrialist, had with his workers. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;an instant classic among Southern memoirs of the last 50 years&quot;. An article by Mann adapted from this book appeared with photographs in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in April 2015. &quot;Hold Still&quot; was a finalist for the 2015 National Book Award.
Mann&#x27;s tenth book, &quot;Remembered Light: Cy Twombly in Lexington&quot; was published in 2016. It is an insider&#x27;s photographic view of Twombly&#x27;s studio in Lexington. It was published concurrently with an exhibit of color and black-and-white photographs at the Gagosian Gallery. It shows the overflow of Twombly&#x27;s general modus operandi: the leftovers, smears, and stains, or, as critic Simon Schama said in his essay at the start of the book, &quot;an absence turned into a presence&quot;.
Mann&#x27;s eleventh book, &quot;Sally Mann: A Thousand Crossings&quot;, written by Sarah Greenough and Sarah Kennel, is a large (320 pages) compendium of works spanning 40 years, with 230 photographs by Mann. It served as a catalog for an exhibit at the National Gallery of Art entitled &quot;Sally Mann: A Thousand Crossings&quot;, which opened March 4, 2018. This was the first major survey of the artist&#x27;s work to travel internationally.
In her recent projects, Mann has started exploring the issues of race and legacy of slavery that were a central theme of her memoir &quot;Hold Still&quot;. They include a series of portraits of black men, all made during one-hour sessions in the studio with models not previously known to her. Mann was inspired by Bill T. Jones&#x27;s use of the Walt Whitman 1856 poem &quot;Poem of the Body&quot; in his art. She &quot;borrowed the idea, using the poem as a template for [her] own exploration&quot;. Several pictures from this body of work were highlighted in Aperture Foundation magazine in the summer of 2016, and they also appeared in &quot;A Thousand Crossings&quot;. 

The &quot;Crossings&quot; book and exhibit introduced a series of photographs of African-American historic churches photographed on expired film. Mann also published a series of tintype photographs of a swamp that was known to have served as refuge for escaped slaves. Some critics believe that she is working deeply through of the legacy of white violence in the South, while others have voiced concern that Mann&#x27;s work at times repeats rather than critiques tropes of white domination and violence in the region.

==&quot;Diaries of Home&quot;==
In 2024, a group exhibition at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, &quot;Diaries of Home&quot;, raised controversy from local elected officials. The exhibition &quot;features works by women and nonbinary artists, who explore the multilayered concepts of family, community, and home.” Mann&#x27;s work focuses on family portraits, which include images of her children in the nude. While the museum described this as “intimate and compelling,” locals have complained of “pedophilia” to the Dallas Express. Supporters of the exhibit have argued that this outcry &quot;reflects a broader, escalating trend of censorship targeting artists and institutions whose work challenges societal norms or explores sensitive topics.&quot;

==Personal life==
Mann, born and raised in Virginia, is the daughter of Robert Munger and Elizabeth Munger. In Mann&#x27;s introduction for her book &quot;Immediate Family&quot;, she &quot;expresses stronger memories for the black woman, Virginia (Gee-Gee) Carter, who oversaw her upbringing than for her own mother&quot;. Elizabeth Munger was not a big part of Mann&#x27;s life, and Elizabeth said &quot;Sally may look like me, but inside she&#x27;s her father&#x27;s child.&quot; 

Virginia Carter, born in 1894, raised Mann and her two brothers and was an admirable woman. &quot;Left with six children and a public education system for which she paid taxes but which forbade classes for black children beyond the seventh grade, Gee-Gee managed somehow to send each of them to out-of-state boarding schools and, ultimately, to college.&quot; Virginia Carter died in 1994.
In 1969 Sally met Larry Mann, and in 1970 they married. Larry Mann is an attorney. Before practicing law, he was a blacksmith. Around 1996 Larry was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. The couple live together in their home which they built on Sally&#x27;s family&#x27;s farm in Lexington, Virginia.
They have three children together: Emmett (born 1979), served for a time in the Peace Corps. He died by suicide in 2016, after battling with schizophrenia following a life-threatening car collision. Jessie (born 1981), became an artist. Virginia (born 1985) became a lawyer.
Mann is passionate about endurance horse racing. In 2006, her Arabian horse ruptured an aneurysm while she was riding him. In the horse&#x27;s death throes, Mann was thrown to the ground, the horse rolled over her, and the impact broke her back. It took her two years to recover from the accident. During this time, she made a series of ambrotype self-portraits. These self-portraits were on view for the first time in November 2010 at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts as a part of &quot;Sally Mann: the Flesh and the Spirit&quot;.

<text>Sulejman Tihić (26 November 1951 – 25 September 2014) was a Bosnian politician who served as the 4th Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2002 to 2006. He was a member and later president of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA). From 2007 until his death in 2014, Tihić served as member of the national House of Peoples.

Born in Bosanski Šamac, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Sarajevo in 1975. Following his graduation, Tihić worked as a judge, prosecutor and a lawyer. During the Bosnian War of 1992–95, he was captured by Serb soldiers and was tortured in concentration camps in both Bosnia and Serbia. Following the war, Tihić entered into politics. Already being a founding member of the SDA, he was named its president in 2001. At the 2002 general election, Tihić was elected Bosniak member of the Bosnian Presidency, serving as its member until 2006. Following his time in the Presidency, Tihić was appointed as member of the national House of Peoples in 2007. As president of the SDA, he took part in many constitutional reform talks, most notably in those regarding the Prud Agreement between 2008 and 2009.

After years of health issues, including cancer, Tihić died on 25 September 2014 in Sarajevo, at the age of 62. He was buried in his hometown of Bosanski Šamac two days later.

==Early life==
Tihić was born in the town of Bosanski Šamac in northern Bosnia. He obtained a degree from the Sarajevo Law School in 1975. Tihić returned to Bosanski Šamac where he worked as a judge, prosecutor and a lawyer.

==Bosnian War==
When the Bosnian War started in April 1992, Tihić was captured by Serb soldiers and was tortured in three concentration camps in Bosnia, in Bosanski Šamac, Brčko and the Batković camp in Bijeljina, before being taken by helicopter to the Batajnica neighborhood of Belgrade in Serbia. He was also later tortured in a prison in Sremska Mitrovica.

==Political career==
In 1990, Tihić was one of the founding members of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA). On 13 October 2001, Tihić was chosen to succeed Alija Izetbegović as president of the party. At the 2002 general election, he was elected to the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the 2006 general election, Tihić decided to run for a second term in the Presidency, but failed to do so when election day came, winning only 27.5% of the votes, 35.3% less than elected Haris Silajdžić.

After the presidency, he would later go on to be a member of the House of Peoples of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 14 April 2007 until his death on 25 September 2014. During that period, Tihić was also Chairman of the House of Peoples a few times. American human rights lawyer Francis Boyle stated in his correspondence to the public that Tihić and Sakib Softić had ordered the restitution request from his original lawsuit in the Bosnian genocide case to be voided, thereby returning a favor to his coalition partners Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) in Republika Srpska.

===Prud Agreement===

Together with the leaders of the three most important &#x27;nationalist&#x27; political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who acted as representatives of the constituent peoples, Milorad Dodik of the SNSD and Dragan Čović of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH), Tihić created the &quot;Prud Agreement&quot; or &quot;Prud Process&quot;, an agreement that pertained to state property, census, constitutional changes, reconstructing the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and solving the legal status of Brčko District. The agreement was created in the village of Prud on 8 November 2008. The reforms promised by the agreement would &quot;build the ability of the State to meet the requirements of the EU integration process&quot;.

At a subsequent meeting in Banja Luka on 26 January 2009, the party leaders set out a plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina as a decentralized country with three levels of government. The middle level of government was anticipated to be made up by four territorial units with legislative, executive and judicial branches of government.

Controversy surrounded the creation of a third entity, Republika Srpska’s territorial integrity, and the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

A further meeting was held in Mostar on 23 February 2009, hosted by Čović.

On 20 July 2009, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Valentin Inzko suggested that the process between the three &#x27;nationalist&#x27; parties had effectively ended. Instead, it had changed into a process involving many more political parties. Inzko believed that minor-level constitutional reform can be delivered through the meetings.

==Illness and death==
Tihić had a tumor on his colon removed in January 2008 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. On 30 September 2013 it was announced that Tihić had been diagnosed with cancer. He was treated surgically in Germany on 4 October 2013; doctors expressed satisfaction with his recovery. On 22 August 2014, he was hospitalized at the Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo and died there on 25 September 2014, aged 62. Tihić was buried in the cemetery of the White Mosque in his hometown of Bosanski Šamac two days later, on 27 September.

<doc id="518180" wikidata="Q5433758" url="?curid=518180" title="Fanfare for St Edmundsbury">
<text>The Fanfare for St Edmundsbury is a fanfare for three trumpets written by the British composer Benjamin Britten for a &quot;Pageant of Magna Carta&quot; in the grounds of St Edmundsbury Cathedral, Bury St Edmunds in 1959.

==Technical==

The fanfare is scored for three trumpets. The parts are notated for modern trumpets in C; however, they are actually written using only the notes of three different harmonic series based on F, C and D and could thus be performed on three natural trumpets in those three keys. The natural trumpets were not specified by the composer; indeed it may have been a bit early in the rediscovery of natural trumpet playing for it to be safe to do so. This technique had been used by the classical composers in horn section writing, to enable lines to be played outside the natural scale (e.g. 2 horns in C and 2 horns in D or E flat). Some of the first experimentation of this technique is demonstrated by F.G.A. Dauvernè from around 1850. Dauvernè was Arban&#x27;s teacher (the father of modern-day trumpeting) and wrote one of the last methods for the dying art of natural trumpet playing, including some of the first exercises for the cornet and valved trumpet. Nevertheless, the scoring is sometimes taken as signal enough to justify playing it on natural trumpets, on which it works well. This multitonal use of natural instruments is an interesting trick which might have caused some surprise at the height of the natural trumpet&#x27;s power in the Baroque era, when three playing together would almost always have been in the same key. Performance of the fanfare on modern valved instruments remains the norm and does not lessen the effect: the parts still &quot;feel&quot; like natural trumpet lines. Britten commented, &quot;The trumpeters should be placed as far apart as possible, even when the Fanfare is played indoors.&quot;

==Description==

Each trumpet plays one solo &quot;verse&quot; in turn. These are not only separated from each other in key but also in style: although they all include some long notes at phrase ends, overall one is a bouncy 6/8, one a martial-sounding, bold statement, and one a series of smooth arpeggios. So when they all come in together at the end and play their verses simultaneously the initial effect seems chaotic. As the last playthrough progresses it gradually dawns on the listener that a unity is emerging from the chaos as the long notes start to settle and overlap: by the last few bars the three trumpets are playing triumphant block chords together.

==Recordings==

Many recordings are available, but nearly always on compilations of modern brass or fanfare music – the piece is so short that it almost never receives separate billing. Recordings have been made by the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble and similar groups.

<doc id="518183" wikidata="Q2734167" url="?curid=518183" title="Mr. Game &amp; Watch">
<text>is a 2D generic stick figure-styled silhouette character, created by Nintendo as an amalgamation of various characters that appeared in the &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; handheld consoles. He was created by Gunpei Yokoi, with an intention of representing the Game &amp; Watch collection, as the consoles had no main mascot, rather characters designed for the minigames. He debuted in &quot;Ball&quot; from Game &amp; Watch. Mr. Game &amp; Watch has appeared as a cameo in several other Nintendo games, such as &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Heaven Fever&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;. 

The Game &amp; Watch consoles were conceptualized by Gunpei Yokoi, and Makoto Kano created their visuals. Each visual was carefully conceived, drawn polished, and tested by a small group of designers, consisting of Yokoi and Kano alongside Masao Yamamoto and Takehiro Izushi. His appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; is based on the various games released, from which his attacks and animations are drawn. His appearance and overall existence have received generally positive reception.

== Concept and design ==

Although the specific character did not exist until 2001, he is an amalgamation of the avatars from the Game &amp; Watch series of handheld consoles released by Nintendo in the 1980s. Video game and electronic toy designer Gunpei Yokoi witnessed a businessman fiddling with an LCD calculator out of boredom while riding a bullet train. Inspired by this, he conceptualized a portable electronic minigame that doubled as a watch for killing time. The visuals and LCD design were conducted by Makoto Kano, although he was also present in the original handheld&#x27;s hardware production. At the time there were only a handful of designers, so work wasn&#x27;t equally balanced and multiple people worked on numerous different tasks. According to Kano, he designed the system shell and its color, the packaging, and the stick-figure silhouettes.

The games were designed around everyday tasks, which is why the titles had simple concepts such as cooking. The game and its looks were designed on a blackboard by the development team, and Masao Yamamoto drew up the ideas in a notebook. He gave the visuals to Kano for polishing, where he recalled how he would say, &quot;The rest is up to you&quot;. After he would redraw the designs, it then became clear whether or not they would continue with the project. They would then create a model of how the game would function using plastic and wheat bulbs about the size of an A4 sheet of paper to test the smoothness of the visuals. Yokoi was very keen on making character movement natural, which the designers dubbed the &quot;Yokoi standard&quot;. Yamamoto and Takehiro Izushi worked on the software afterwards.

The first handheld released was &quot;Ball&quot; in 1980, the spiritual introduction to Mr. Game &amp; Watch. Kano&#x27;s enjoyment of visual design for the handhelds were increased with the introduction of a new line of Game &amp; Watch devices, the Wide Screen variants. In a 2010 interview on Iwata Asks, Kano said that he modelled the octopus character for the title &quot;Octupus&quot; after Hatchan the Octopus, a Japanese manga character who first appeared in 1931. He tried to design the octopus so it would be recognized as such in other countries. 

The specific character known as Mr. Game &amp; Watch was introduced into &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; in 2001; as a representation of the series as a whole, his attacks and other abilities are direct references to various Game &amp; Watch titles. His character icon also represents the Game &amp; Watch&#x27;s alarm feature, where it depicts the character holding a bell. The character comes with seven alternate colors to choose from before a match.

== Appearances ==
Mr. Game &amp; Watch originally appeared as playable characters in the 1980 Game &amp; Watch game &quot;Ball&quot;, as well as &quot;Flagman&quot;, &quot;Vermin&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;, &quot;Manhole&quot;, &quot;Helmet&quot;, &quot;Lion&quot;, &quot;Parachute&quot;, &quot;Octopus&quot;, &quot;Chef&quot;, &quot;Turtle Bridge&quot;, &quot;Fire Attack&quot;, &quot;Oil Panic&quot;, &quot;Greenhouse&quot;, &quot;Rain Shower&quot; and &quot;Life Boat&quot;. The Game &amp; Watch brand is represented in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series with the character Mr. Game &amp; Watch, appearing in &quot;Melee&quot;, &quot;Brawl&quot;, &quot;3DS and Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;. As he represents the &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series, he pre-dates Pac-Man by one month as being the oldest character on the roster.

Beyond the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; and &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series, Mr. Game &amp; Watch has also appeared in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot;. He has also made cameo appearances in &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Heaven Fever&quot;, &quot;Nintendo 3DS Sound&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Pokémon: Advanced&quot; and &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;.

==Reception==
Mr. Game &amp; Watch has been met with a polarizing response from critics, mostly with regard to the character&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. David Mello of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Mr. Game &amp; Watch second in his list of forgotten Nintendo characters, stating that he is &quot;a classic character from the younger days of Nintendo&quot;. Michael Derosa of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; listed Mr. Game &amp; Watch as a character that should be added in &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, stating that &quot;a 2D character in the magical 3D &quot;Mario Kart&quot; world would offer the type of visual contrast that gamers love&quot;.

In &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Masahiro Sakurai described Mr. Game &amp; Watch along with Duck Hunt as fighters that fall &quot;outside of people&#x27;s typical expectations&quot;, and explained further that without such characters the roster might only have typical &quot;hero/heroine&quot; type fighters in the lineup, which would be &quot;probably not very interesting&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; noted that Mr. Game &amp; Watch became weirder as it maintains his unique 2D nature in an otherwise 3D world. As a result, several magazines have criticized the character for being &quot;annoying&quot; and included at the game, despite being not a realistic character or one of the Nintendo icons. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;, it was considered as &quot;low-tier&quot;, or one of the weakest characters available for selection. In 2020, Enrique &quot;Maister&quot; Hernández Solís became the first professional &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; player to garner successful tournament results while using Mr. Game &amp; Watch; before it, he remained an unranked position in the Panda Global Rankings charts until eventually ranking 6th place globally. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, while Mr. Game &amp; Watch was still considered low-tier at the time of Maister&#x27;s 2019 win, the &quot;Smash&quot; community eventually realized that the character had become significantly stronger. He began receiving criticism toward the character and himself, with people blaming his success for the character he chose and not his skill, pointing out abilities of his that were too powerful or too fast to react to. Maister commented on the backlash and acknowledged the character&#x27;s criticism due to his faults, but he struggled with negativity and threats directed towards him personally and it has been chosen to lower how much time he spent on social media.

===Controversy===
In the 1982 Game &amp; Watch title &quot;Fire Attack&quot;, the player controls a cowboy defending his fort from an onslaught of Native Americans attempting to burn the fort down. In the game, the Native Americans wear a feather on their head and attack the fort with torches. This has since been deemed as a racist Native American stereotype, and the racial aspects of the characters were removed for the re-release of the game in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot;.

For &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; in 2018, Mr. Game &amp; Watch was given new designs to his animations; instead of his overall appearance remaining a stick figure silhouette, whenever he would perform an action represented from a Game &amp; Watch title, he would also assume the cosmetics of the character in question and look like them, then returning to his default look when the action is complete. With this came the return of his Native American counterpart, which is referenced in one of his attacks. After a Nintendo Direct that showcased the character, he was used in gameplay during a Japanese livestream, where the attack was used and visible for about half a second.

Later, claims were made on Twitter and an online message board that the character represented a racist Native American stereotype. These claims were later echoed elsewhere online. Nintendo took action by removing the feather headband on his head and responded with the following statement to &quot;Eurogamer&quot;:

Nintendo has been planning to distribute an update for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; that removes the feather from the silhouette of Mr. Game &amp; Watch. The original game on which this depiction of the character is based was released more than three decades ago and does not represent our company values today. We sincerely apologise that this change was not noticed in our marketing material and are continuing our work to make &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; an experience that is both welcoming and fun for everyone.

===Amiibo===
In September 2015, the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; line of Amiibo released Mr. Game &amp; Watch Amiibo collectible. The design also came with 3 additional detachable alternatives of the character in different positions and moves. Additionally, he is sold as well in the Amiibo Retro Pack, a 3-part Amiibo set including, Mr. Game &amp; Watch, R.O.B., and Duck Hunt.

The character can be scanned into the &quot;3DS/Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot; titles, which a player can use to create a personal CPU, which can train and fight using artificial intelligence. The Amiibo can also be used to unlock a cosmetic option for &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; and &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot;, as well as the 3DS port of the latter.

<doc id="518184" wikidata="Q372747" url="?curid=518184" title="Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System">
<text>The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS), nicknamed &quot;Con Air&quot;, is a United States Marshals Service airline charged with the transportation of persons in legal custody between prisons, detention centers, courthouses, and other locations. It is the largest prison transport network in the world. Though primarily used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, JPATS also assists military and state law enforcement. Marshals involved in prisoner transportation are referred to as Aviation Enforcement Officers (AEOs).

The agency is managed by the USMS out of the JPATS headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. JPATS was formed in 1995 from the merger of the Marshals Service air fleet with that of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. JPATS completes more than 260,000 prisoner/alien movements per year. Air fleet operations are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with hubs in Las Vegas, Nevada; Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Additionally, the Federal Transfer Center at Oklahoma City&#x27;s Will Rogers World Airport was built especially to facilitate prisoner transport on JPATS.

Usually, the airline employs Boeing 737 aircraft to transport convicts and illegal residents of the United States for extradition. Smaller jets and turboprops may also be used to transport individual prisoners who are considered particularly dangerous or notorious, as well as individuals in the witness protection program.

According to the Marshals Service, JPATS owns and operates four Boeing 737s.

JPATS aircraft use the ICAO designator DOJ with the callsign JUSTICE.

==History and evolution==
On November 1, 1919, San Francisco Police officer (and future barnstormer) Ivan R. Gates became the first to transport a prisoner by air, one James Kelly (convicted of carrying concealed weapons), from Alameda to San Francisco Police Chief D. A. White.

Prior to the existence of JPATS, the air transport of federal inmates over long distances was complicated. The process required an escort by two U.S. Marshals, accompanying the inmate on a regular passenger airplane. This posed numerous problems, including danger to civilians, a backlog of marshals needed to perform such escorts, and a high taxpayer expense.

On August 20, 1985, the U.S. Marshals were offered a transfer from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of a Boeing 727 aircraft. Though no purpose was originally designated for this plane, one official had the idea of using it for the mass transportation of federal inmates. JPATS&#x27; predecessor was the &quot;National Prisoner Transportation System&quot; of the U.S. Marshals Service.

The airline ultimately improved the efficiency of inmate transportation and made the sight of a shackled commercial airline passenger largely a thing of the past. For a plane full of 200 inmates, only 12 marshals are required. Marshals are trained with aircraft emergency procedures very similar to those flight attendants learn to protect the aircraft&#x27;s occupants.

==Today==

Today&#x27;s JPATS fleet has expanded to four full-sized aircraft. These planes fly a large series of routes that serve nearly every major U.S. city.

The flight schedules are kept secret from the public, and are known only to those directly involved in its operation. Inmates scheduled to fly are given little or no advance notice of their flight, to deter escapes and sabotage, and to prevent harm from outsiders.
Passengers aboard a flight are restrained with handcuffs as well as ankle and waist chains which are double- or even triple-locked. Those who pose additional danger may be forced to wear additional restraints, such as reinforced mittens that completely isolate and almost completely immobilize the hands, handcuff covers which conceal the keyholes, and face masks to prevent biting and spitting. However, due to FAA regulations inmates are not physically restrained to their seats in any way except for seat belts used during takeoff and landing.

Flight and seating arrangements are made carefully with the intent to separate inmates who may conflict with one another. For example, members of rival prison gangs may be transported on different days to help reduce the risk of an in-flight incident. Unlike the practice of most jails and prisons, male and female inmates fly together on the same planes.

==Fleet==
, the JPATS fleet consists of the following aircraft:
=== Fleet development ===
, JPATS was seeking to purchase an additional Boeing 737-700 or Boeing 737-800 to replace one of its current Boeing 737-400 aircraft.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Con Air&quot; (1997), starring Nicolas Cage, was inspired by the operations of the agency, with the title being a reference to its nickname. The film is set on a Fairchild C-123 Provider, an aircraft that JPATS never actually operated, and its interior more closely resembles a prison than actual JPATS aircraft, which do not significantly differ from most airliners. The film&#x27;s screenplay explains this by saying that the prisoners on the flight are &quot;the worst of the worst&quot;, including several serial killers and mass murderers.
*&quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998) depicted the story of a JPATS Flight 343, a Boeing 727-200 that crashed during flight and the manhunt for a prisoner who escapes following the crash.
*The &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; episode &quot;Island of Dr. Mystico&quot; features an airline named &quot;Prison Air&quot;, a parody of JPATS.
*In &quot;The Unusuals&quot; episode &quot;The Dentist&quot; (2009), Det. Eddie Alvarez asks suspended U.S. Marshal and suspected felon Ben Foster if he will be transporting a prisoner via &quot;JPATS&quot;. Marshal Foster appears confused until Det. Alvarez explains that it is the &quot;Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System&quot;. Marshal Foster then confirms the prisoner will be transported via JPATS, however he is really breaking the prisoner out of custody after robbing the police precinct of valuable evidence against a criminal.
*In the &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; episode &quot;Thirsty Bird&quot; (2014), prisoner Piper Chapman is transported on a JPATS plane for a transfer from Litchfield prison in New York to a Chicago detention facility. US Marshals are shown doing prisoner pat-downs before boarding and then staffing the flight. Prisoners are shown boarding the flight from various locations, including both males and females.

<text>August Richard Suhr (January 3, 1906 – January 15, 2004) was a Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman. Suhr was born in San Francisco, California. The fourth son of August H Suhr and Elise (Nobmann) Suhr, both of German descent. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Suhr was a career .279 hitter with 84 home runs and 818 RBI in 1435 games played with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1930–39) and Philadelphia Phillies (1939–40). He hit better than .300 twice, with a career high .312 in 1936 and .303 in 1939 with the Pirates and Phillies. Defensively, he recorded a career .992 fielding percentage as a first baseman. Prior to playing in the majors, Suhr played for the San Francisco Seals. In 1929, he hit .381 with 51 home runs and 177 RBI for his team. During that season, he became the only player in baseball history to be sued (in addition to his team) by a fan injured after being struck by a foul ball he hit. The case was dismissed under the legal Baseball Rule, a verdict upheld by the California Supreme Court three years later. In his rookie season with the Pirates, he belted 17 homers with 107 RBI. He produced three 100-RBI seasons in his 11-year career. Selected for the 1936 All-Star game, Suhr played 1,339 games at first base for Pittsburgh, a team record for a Pirates&#x27; first baseman.

On September 11, 1931, Suhr started a then National League record streak of 822 games played, which ended on June 4, 1937 when he missed a game to attend his mother&#x27;s funeral. His record stood until June 12, 1957 when it was broken by Stan Musial. The record is currently held by Steve Garvey.

After retiring from baseball, Suhr became a liquor store owner. He died in Scottsdale, Arizona, of natural causes at the age of 98.

<text>Cadmium pigments are a class of pigments that contain cadmium. Most of the cadmium produced worldwide has been for use in rechargeable nickel–cadmium batteries, which have been replaced by other rechargeable nickel-chemistry cell varieties such as NiMH cells, but about half of the remaining consumption of cadmium, which is approximately annually, is used to produce colored cadmium pigments. The principal pigments are a family of yellow, orange and red cadmium sulfides and sulfoselenides, as well as compounds with other metals.

Cadmium is toxic to humans and other animals in very small amounts, especially when it is inhaled, which often happens when working with powdered pigment or breathing the dust from chalk pastels. As a result, it is not appropriate for children to use any art supplies that contain cadmium pigments. However, because the pigments have some desirable qualities, such as resistance to fading, some adult artists continue to use them.

==Artists&#x27; paints==
Brilliantly colored, with good permanence and tinting power, cadmium yellow, cadmium orange and cadmium red are familiar artists’ colors, and are frequently employed as architectural paints, as they can add life and vibrancy to renderings. Their greatest use is in the coloring of plastics and specialty paints, which must resist processing or service temperatures up to . The colorfastness or permanence of cadmium requires protection from the element&#x27;s tendency to slowly form carbonate salts with exposure to air. Most paint vehicles accomplish this, but cadmium colors will fade in fresco or mural painting.

The following are commonly used as pigments in artists&#x27; paints:
* Cadmium yellow is cadmium sulfide (CdS), C.I. Pigment Yellow 37.
* Cadmium sulfoselenide is a solid solution of CdS and cadmium selenide; depending on the sulfur-to-selenium ratio, C.I. Pigment Orange 20 or C.I. Pigment Red 108 is obtained.
* Zinc cadmium sulfide is a greenish, solid solution of CdS and zinc sulfide, C.I. Pigment Yellow 35.
* Cadmium yellow is sometimes mixed with viridian to give a vivid green mixture called cadmium green.

When first introduced, there were hardly any stable pigments in the yellow-to-red range, with orange and bright red being very troublesome. The cadmium pigments eventually replaced compounds such as mercury(II) sulfide (the original vermilion) with greatly improved lightfastness.

Cadmium pigments are known for excellent lightfastness, although the lighter shades can fade in sunlight. A cadmium yellow paint was frequently used on Bob Ross&#x27; TV show &quot;The Joy of Painting&quot;.

In July 2023, the brilliance of cadmium yellow (especially &quot;Cadmium Yellow Lemon No.1 by Lucien Lefebvre-Foinet&quot;) used by some modern artists, was reported to have faded over time due to chemical degradation.

== Coloring art glass ==

Cadmium compounds are utilized in coloring borosilicate glass used by artists in lampworking. The palette is often referred to as &quot;cadmium colors&quot; or &quot;cadmium-based colors&quot; and is marked by uniquely bright and saturated tones not found in other colored glass. Cadmium pigments used in borosilicate have a relatively short history, with the first commercial formulations hitting the market in 2000 under the name Crayon Colors by Henry Grimmett of Glass Alchemy.

Cadmium-compound-containing glass exhibits a characteristically low heat tolerance when melted, and therefore must be treated with caution when lampworking to avoid boiling off of the cadmium sulfide. CdS has a boiling point of 980 °C (1,796 °F), putting its maximum temperature tolerance as a pigment not far above the working temperature range for borosilicate, which has a softening point of approximately 850 °C (1,562 °F).

==Safety==

Cadmium sulfide is not very toxic ( above 5,000 mg/kg). Cadmium is introduced into the body most commonly through smoking and the diet. Poisoning by pigments is uncommon but of continuing concern. Acute exposure to cadmium vapors can arise from welding near cadmium pigments.

The cadmium pigments have been partially replaced by azo pigments, which have significantly inferior lightfastness.

In December 2013, the Swedish Chemicals Agency (KEMI) proposed a case to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in favor of restricting or banning cadmium use in artists’ paints, as cadmium in pigments used in other types of paints was already restricted and regulated via TARIC codes and REACH Annex XVII. This proposal stated that cadmium in the body leads to increased risk of bone fractures and breast cancer as well as an array of environmental impacts, and that paint washed down the drain is absorbed by crops that are then consumed, increasing the average dietary cadmium intake. This can cause an array of health effects, including kidney and liver damage, skeletal damage, several types of cancers and death. KEMI&#x27;s proposal was ultimately declined.

In a June 2015 article of &quot;Just Paint,&quot; published by Golden Artist Colors, the company argued against KEMI&#x27;s proposal, offering that &quot;There are no alternatives that match all of the characteristics of cadmium pigments.&quot; This statement was also included in Golden&#x27;s response to KEMI&#x27;s request for information on cadmium-pigmented artists’ paints while the agency was composing its ban proposal. The article also stated that a ban would be technically feasible for some artists, but not all, and that &quot;cadmium colors are not for use by children, should not be spray applied or sanded, and unless one is properly protected from exposure and in a non-household setting, use of dry cadmium pigment should be avoided.&quot;

Inhalation poses the greatest risk from cadmium pigments, though the chemical is very low-risk when sealed within a pigment particle because of its insolubility. The use of chalk pastels containing cadmium colors is among the highest risks for artists, as these pastels create a dust that can be inhaled.
