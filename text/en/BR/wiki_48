<text>The Battle off Samar was the centermost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history, which took place in the Philippine Sea off Samar Island, in the Philippines on October 25, 1944. It was the only major action in the larger battle in which the Americans were largely unprepared. After the previous day&#x27;s fighting, the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s First Mobile Striking Force, under the command of Takeo Kurita, had suffered significant damage and appeared to be retreating westward. However, by the next morning, the Japanese force had turned around and resumed its advance toward Leyte Gulf. With Admiral William Halsey Jr. lured into taking his powerful Third Fleet north after a decoy fleet and the Seventh Fleet engaged to the south, the recently-landed 130,000 men of the Sixth Army were left vulnerable to Japanese attack on Leyte.

Kurita, aboard the battleship , took his large force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers from the San Bernardino Strait and headed south toward Leyte, where they encountered Task Unit 77.4.3 (&quot;Taffy 3&quot;), the northernmost of the three escort carrier groups under Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague that comprised the only American forces remaining in the area. Composed of only six small escort carriers, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts, Taffy 3 was intended to provide shore support and anti-submarine patrols, and did not have guns capable of penetrating the Japanese armor. The Japanese opened fire shortly after dawn, targeting Taffy 3&#x27;s escort carriers, which Kurita mistook for the main carriers of the Third Fleet. The escort carriers fled for the cover of rain squalls and launched their aircraft in defense, while the three destroyers and destroyer escort , led by , launched a torpedo attack that sank one ship and sent the Japanese strike force into disarray.

Japanese aircraft from the base at Luzon launched &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks on the retreating American task force, sinking one escort carrier and damaging three others. With Taffy 2&#x27;s aircraft joining the battle, the increasing severity of the air attack further convinced Kurita that he was engaging the Third Fleet&#x27;s surface carriers. Satisfied with sinking what he believed were multiple carriers and worried the bulk of the Third Fleet was approaching, Kurita withdrew his fleet north, having failed to carry out his orders to attack the landing forces at Leyte Gulf.

Taffy 3 sustained heavy losses in the action, losing two escort carriers, two destroyers, a destroyer escort and numerous aircraft. Over 1,000 Americans died, comparable to the combined losses of American men and ships at the Coral Sea and Midway. Three Japanese cruisers were sunk by air attack, and three others were damaged. The Japanese had over 2,700 casualties. Taffy 3 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Ernest E. Evans of the sunk &quot;Johnston&quot; was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz wrote afterwards that the success of Taffy 3 was &quot;nothing short of special dispensation from the Lord Almighty.&quot; The Battle off Samar has been cited by historians as one of the greatest last stands in naval history.

==Background==
The overall Japanese strategy at Leyte Gulf—a plan known as Shō-Go 1—called for Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force to lure the American Third Fleet away from the Allied landings on Leyte, using an apparently vulnerable force of Japanese carriers as bait. The landing forces, stripped of air cover by the Third Fleet, would then be attacked from the west and south by Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force, and Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force. Kurita&#x27;s Center Force consisted of five battleships, including and , the largest battleships afloat, escorted by cruisers and destroyers. Nishimura&#x27;s flotilla included two battleships and would be followed by Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima&#x27;s cruisers and destroyers.

On the night of October 23, the American submarines and detected Center Force entering the Palawan Passage along the northwest coast of Palawan Island. After alerting Halsey, the submarines torpedoed and sank two cruisers, while crippling a third and forcing it to withdraw. One of the cruisers lost was Admiral Kurita&#x27;s flagship, but he was rescued and transferred his flag to &quot;Yamato&quot;.

Subsequently, the carriers of the Third Fleet launched a series of air strikes against Kurita&#x27;s forces in the Sibuyan Sea, damaging several vessels and sinking &quot;Musashi&quot;, initially forcing Kurita to retreat. At the same time, the Third Fleet light carrier was sunk by a Japanese bomb, with secondary explosions causing damage to a cruiser assisting alongside.

In the Battle of Surigao Strait, Nishimura&#x27;s ships entered a deadly trap. Outmatched by the U.S. Seventh Fleet Support Force, they were devastated, running a gauntlet of torpedoes from 39 PT boats and 22 destroyers before coming under accurate radar-directed gunfire from six battleships (five of them survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack) and seven cruisers. As Shima&#x27;s force encountered what was left of Nishimura&#x27;s ships, he decided to retreat, stating &quot;If we continued dashing further north, it was quite clear that we should only fall into a ready trap.&quot;

At the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet savaged the Center Force, which had been detected on its way to landing forces from the north. Center Force lacked any air cover to defend against the 259 sorties from the five fleet carriers &quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Essex&quot;, &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;Franklin&quot;, and light carrier &quot;Cabot&quot;, the combination of which sank the massive battleship &quot;Musashi&quot; (sister to &quot;Yamato&quot;) with 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes.

Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet, having spotted Japanese carriers, engaged them in the Battle off Cape Engaño. Although ordered to destroy enemy forces threatening the Philippine invasion area, Halsey was also ordered by Nimitz to destroy a major portion of the Japanese fleet if the opportunity arose.

==Forces==
The Japanese Center Force now consisted of the battleships &quot;Yamato&quot;, , , and ; heavy cruisers , , , , , ; light cruisers , and ; and 11 -, - and -class destroyers. The battleships carried a minimum of guns, firing shells over a range of more than . The heavy cruisers carried batteries plus torpedo tubes, and were capable of . The Japanese destroyers outnumbered Sprague&#x27;s eleven to three.

Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s Task Unit 77.4.3 (&quot;Taffy 3&quot;) consisted of , , , , and . Screening for Taffy 3 were the destroyers , and , and destroyer escorts , , , and . These six escort carriers carried about 165 aircraft, equivalent to two fleet carriers. Each carrier had a squadron composed of twelve to fourteen FM-2 Wildcat fighters and an equivalent number of Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. Yet, the carriers had a top speed of only 18 knots, far less than the Japanese cruisers and destroyers capable of 30 knots. In addition, none of his ships had a gun larger than , firing shells, but unable to penetrate the Japanese cruiser or battleship armor, and had a limited range of .

==Battle==
Kurita&#x27;s force passed through San Bernardino Strait at 03:00 on October 25, 1944 and steamed southwards along the coast of Samar, hoping that Halsey had taken the bait and moved most of his fleet away as he had in fact done. Kurita had been advised that Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force had been destroyed at Surigao Strait and would not be joining his force at Leyte Gulf. However, Kurita did not receive the transmission from the Northern Force that they had successfully lured away Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet of battleships and fleet carriers. Through most of the battle, Kurita would be haunted by doubts about Halsey&#x27;s actual location. The wind was from the North-Northeast and visibility was approximately with a low overcast and occasional heavy rain squalls which the US forces would exploit for concealment in the battle to come.

===Taffy 3 comes under attack===
Steaming about east of Samar before dawn on October 25, &quot;St. Lo&quot; launched a four-plane antisubmarine patrol while the remaining carriers of Taffy 3 prepared for the day&#x27;s air strikes against the landing beaches. At 06:37, Ensign William C. Brooks, flying a Grumman TBF Avenger from &quot;St. Lo&quot;, sighted a number of ships expected to be from Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet, but they appeared to be Japanese. When he was notified, Admiral Sprague was incredulous, and he demanded positive identification. Flying in for an even closer look, Brooks reported, &quot;I can see pagoda masts. I see the biggest meatball flag on the biggest battleship I ever saw!&quot; &quot;Yamato&quot; alone displaced as much as all units of Taffy 3 combined. Brooks had spotted the largest of the three attacking Japanese forces, consisting of four battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and about ten destroyers.

They were approaching from the west-northwest only away, and they were already well within gun and visual range of the closest task group, Taffy 3. Armed only with depth charges in case of an encounter with enemy submarines, the aviators nevertheless carried out the first attack of the battle, dropping several depth charges which just bounced off the bow of a cruiser.

The lookouts of Taffy 3 spotted the anti-aircraft fire to the north. The Japanese came upon Taffy 3 at 06:45, achieving complete tactical surprise. At about the same time, others in Taffy 3 had picked up targets from surface radar and Japanese radio traffic. At about 07:00, &quot;Yamato&quot; opened fire at a range of . Lacking the Americans&#x27; gunnery radars and Ford Mark I Fire Control Computer, which provided co-ordinated automatic firing solutions as long as the gun director was pointed at the target, Japanese fire control relied on a mechanical calculator for ballistics and another for own and target course and speed, fed by optical rangefinders. Color-coded dye loads were used in the battleships&#x27; armor-piercing shells so that the spotters of each ship could identify its own fall of shot, a common practice for the capital ships of many navies. The Americans, unfamiliar with battleship combat, were soon astonished by the spectacle of colorful geysers as the first volleys of shellfire found their range. &quot;Nagato&quot; used a brilliant pink; &quot;Haruna&quot; used a greenish-yellow variously described as green or yellow by the Americans; and &quot;Kongō&quot; used a blood-red dye which could appear red, purple, or even blue in some circumstances. &quot;Yamato&quot; used no dye loads, so her shell splashes appeared white.

Not finding the silhouettes of the tiny escort carriers in his identification manuals, Kurita mistook them for large fleet carriers and assumed that he had a task group of the Third Fleet under his guns. His first priority was to eliminate the carrier threat, ordering a &quot;General Attack&quot;: rather than a carefully orchestrated effort, each division in his task force was to attack separately. The Japanese had just changed to a circular anti-aircraft formation, and the order caused some confusion, allowing Sprague to lead the Japanese into a stern chase, which restricted the Japanese to using only their forward guns, and restricted their anti-aircraft gunnery. Sprague&#x27;s ships would not lose as much of their firepower in a stern chase, as their stern chase weapons were more numerous than their forward guns, and his carriers would still be able to operate aircraft.

===The Run to the East (06:45 to 07:15)===
At 06:50 Admiral Sprague ordered a formation course change to 090, directed his carriers to turn to launch their aircraft and then withdraw towards a squall to the east, hoping that bad visibility would reduce the accuracy of Japanese gunfire. He ordered his escorts to the rear of the formation to generate smoke to mask the retreating carriers and ordered the carriers to take evasive action, &quot;chasing salvos&quot; to throw off their enemy&#x27;s aim, and then launched all available FM-2 Wildcat fighter planes and TBM Avenger torpedo bombers with whatever armament they were already loaded with. Some had rockets, machine guns, depth charges, or nothing at all. Very few carried anti-ship bombs or aerial torpedoes which would have enabled aircraft to sink heavy armored warships. The Wildcats were deemed a better fit on such small aircraft carriers instead of the faster and heavier Grumman F6F Hellcats that were flown from the larger U.S. Navy carriers. Their pilots were ordered &quot;to attack the Japanese task force and proceed to Tacloban airstrip, Leyte, to rearm and refuel&quot;. Many of the planes continued to make &quot;dry runs&quot; after expending their ammunition and ordnance to distract the enemy. At about 07:20 the formation entered the squall, and the Japanese fire slackened markedly as they did not have gunnery radar that could penetrate the rain and smoke.

Kurita meanwhile was already experiencing the consequences of ordering a General Attack, as his Fifth Cruiser and Tenth Destroyer Divisions cut across the course of the Third Battleship Division in their haste to close with the American carriers, forcing the battleship &quot;Kongō&quot; to turn north out of formation; &quot;Kongō&quot; acted independently for the remainder of the battle. Concerned that his destroyers would burn too much fuel in a stern chase of what he presumed were fast carriers while obstructing his battleships&#x27; line of fire, Kurita ordered his destroyers to the rear of his formation at 07:10, a decision which had immediate consequences, as the Tenth Destroyer Squadron was forced to turn away just as they were gaining on the right flank of the American formation. For the Second Destroyer Squadron, the consequences were more significant if less immediate: ordered to fall in behind Third Battleship Division, &quot;Yahagi&quot; and her accompanying destroyers steamed north from their position on the south side of Kurita&#x27;s formation seeking division flagship &quot;Kongō&quot;, leaving no Japanese units in position to intercept the American carriers when they turned back south at 07:30. Despite his General Attack order, Kurita continued to dictate fleet course changes throughout the battle.

===American destroyer and destroyer escort counterattack===

Three destroyers and four smaller destroyer escorts had been tasked to protect the escort carriers from aircraft and submarines. The three s—affectionately nicknamed &quot;tin cans&quot; because they lacked armor—were fast enough to keep up with a fast carrier task force. Each had five single-mounted guns and several light antiaircraft guns, none of which were effective against armored warships. Only their ten Mark-15 torpedoes—housed in two swiveling five-tube launchers amidships—posed a serious threat to battleships and cruisers.

An advantage the American destroyers had was the radar-controlled Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System, which provided coordinated automatic firing of their guns as long as the gun director was pointing at the target. A dual-purpose system, the Mark 37&#x27;s gunfire radar and antiaircraft capabilities allowed the destroyers&#x27; guns to remain on target despite poor visibility and their own radical evasive maneuvering. The Japanese reliance on optical range finders aided by color-coded dye loads in each shell and mechanical calculators made it difficult for them to identify their targets through the rain and smoke and limited their ability to maneuver while firing. The different colored splashes the Japanese shells made as they hit the water by the American ships after a near miss prompted one American sailor to quip &quot;They&#x27;re shooting at us in Technicolor!&quot;

The four s were smaller and slower because they had been designed to protect slow freighter convoys against submarines. They were armed with two guns without automatic fire control, and three torpedoes, although their crews rarely trained for torpedo attacks. Since the torpedoes had a range of only about , they were best used at night: during daylight, an attack on heavy warships would have to pass through a gauntlet of shellfire that could reach out to . In this battle they would be launched against a fleet led by the largest battleship in history, although it was the ships&#x27; ability to generate dense, heavy smoke from their funnels and chemical smoke generators which would most influence the course of the battle.

After laying down smoke to hide the carriers from Japanese gunners, they were soon making desperate torpedo runs, using their smoke for concealment. The ship profiles and aggressiveness caused the Japanese to think the destroyers were cruisers, and the destroyer escorts were full-sized destroyers. Their lack of armor allowed armor-piercing rounds to pass right through without exploding, until the Japanese gunners switched to high-explosive (HE) shells, which caused much more damage. Their speed and agility enabled some ships to dodge shellfire completely before launching torpedoes. Effective damage control and redundancy in propulsion and power systems kept them running and fighting even after they had absorbed dozens of hits before they sank, although the decks would be littered with the dead and the seriously wounded. Destroyers from Taffy 2 to the south also found themselves under shellfire, but as they were spotted by , which had signaled for their assistance, they were ordered back to protect their own carriers.

====USS &quot;Johnston&quot;====
At 07:00, Commander Ernest E. Evans of the destroyer , responded to incoming shell fire bracketing carriers of the group he was escorting by laying down a protective smokescreen and zigzagging. At about 07:10, Gunnery Officer Robert Hagen began firing at the closest attackers, then away, and registered several hits on the leading heavy cruisers. The Japanese targeted &quot;Johnston&quot; and soon shell splashes were bracketing the destroyer. In response and without consulting with his commanders, Evans ordered &quot;Johnston&quot; to &quot;flank speed, full left rudder&quot;; &quot;Johnston&quot;, still making smoke and zigzagging, accelerated at maximum speed towards the Japanese.

At 07:15, Hagen concentrated fire on the leading cruiser squadron&#x27;s flagship, the heavy cruiser &quot;Kumano&quot;. Firing the destroyer&#x27;s guns at their maximum range of , &quot;Johnston&quot; scored several hits on &quot;Kumano&quot;″s superstructure, which erupted into flame and smoke.

At 07:16, Sprague ordered Commander William Dow Thomas aboard &quot;Hoel&quot;, in charge of the small destroyer screen, to attack. Struggling to form an attack formation, the three small ships &quot;Hoel&quot;, &quot;Heermann&quot; and &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; began a long sprint to get into firing position for their torpedoes.

&quot;Johnston&quot; pressed its attack, firing more than two hundred shells as it followed an evasive course through moderate swells, making it a difficult target. &quot;Johnston&quot; closed to within maximum torpedo range, and at she fired a full salvo of ten torpedoes. At 07:24, two or three struck, blowing the bow off &quot;Kumano&quot;. Minutes later, at 07:33, four torpedoes narrowly missed &quot;Kongō&quot;. (Morison asserts that &quot;Kongō&quot; was forced to turn away north to avoid these torpedoes, but this is not reflected in &quot;Kongō&quot;″s own action report. It is unclear whether these torpedoes were fired by &quot;Johnston&quot; or &quot;Hoel&quot;.) The heavy cruiser &quot;Suzuya&quot;, suffering damage from air attacks, was also taken out of the fight, as she stopped to assist &quot;Kumano&quot;. The effect of &quot;Johnston&quot;″s attack was to generate confusion in the minds of the Japanese commanders, who thought they were being engaged by American cruisers. Evans then reversed course and, under cover of his smokescreen, opened the range between his ship and the enemy.

At 07:30, three battleship main battery shells passed through the deck of &quot;Johnston&quot; and into her portside engine room, which cut the destroyer&#x27;s speed in half to and disrupted electric power to her aft gun mounts. Hagen reports them as shells from the battleship &quot;Kongō&quot;, at a range of , but this is unlikely, as &quot;Kongō&quot; was on the far side of the Japanese formation and &quot;Kongō&quot;″s action report states that she was not engaging any targets at that time, as she was blinded by a rain squall. Based on the bearing and the angle of fall, it is far more likely that they were shells fired by &quot;Yamato&quot; from a range of , as, moments later, three shells from &quot;Yamato&quot; struck &quot;Johnston&quot;″s bridge, causing numerous casualties and severing the fingers of Commander Evans&#x27;s left hand. The ship was mangled badly, with dead and dying sailors strewn across her bloody decks. &quot;Yamato&quot; reported sinking a &quot;cruiser&quot; (the Japanese consistently overestimated the size of the US ships engaged) with a main battery salvo at 07:27. The light cruiser &quot;Noshiro&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Kishinami&quot;, which were also firing at &quot;Johnston&quot; at the time, reported &quot;The &quot;Yamato&quot; sank one enemy cruiser&quot; at 07:28.

However, &quot;Johnston&quot; was not sunk. Already depleted before the battle, her remaining store of oil did not fuel a catastrophic explosion. The ship found sanctuary in rain squalls, where the crew had time to repair damage, restoring power to two of the three aft gun mounts. &quot;Johnston&quot;″s search radar was destroyed, toppled to the deck in a tangled mess. Also damaged, the fire control radar was quickly returned to service. Only a few minutes were required to bring &quot;Johnston&quot;″s main battery and radar online; from its position in the rain, around 07:35 &quot;Johnston&quot; fired several dozen rounds at the lead Japanese destroyer distant. Firing then shifted to the cruisers approaching from the east, targeting several dozen more rounds at the closest ship away. Neither target could be observed visually, and thus were not positively identified; &quot;Johnston&quot;″s presumed &quot;cruiser&quot; was most likely the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot;.

At 07:37, Commodore Thomas ordered a torpedo attack via voice radio. &quot;Johnston&quot; and &quot;Heermann&quot; acknowledged. As &quot;Johnston&quot; continued its course away from the Japanese, it came upon the charging screening force, led by the damaged &quot;Hoel&quot;. Evans had &quot;Johnston&quot; rejoin the attack, to provide gun support to Thomas&#x27;s small squadron on their torpedo run. Attacking &quot;Tone&quot;, the leading heavy cruiser to the east of the formation, &quot;Johnston&quot; closed to , now firing with reduced efficiency due to her lost SC radar, yet still registering many hits.

During the battle, Evans engaged in several duels with much larger Japanese opponents. At 08:20, emerging through smoke and rain squalls, &quot;Johnston&quot; was confronted by a 36,600-ton &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battleship (probably &quot;Haruna&quot;, which reported engaging a US destroyer with her secondary battery around this time.) &quot;Johnston&quot; fired at least 40 rounds, with over 15 hits on the battleship&#x27;s superstructure observed. &quot;Johnston&quot; reversed course and disappeared in the smoke, avoiding &quot;Haruna&quot;″s return fire. At 08:26 and again at 08:34, Thomas requested an attack on the heavy cruisers to the east of the carriers. Responding at 08:30, &quot;Johnston&quot; bore down on a huge cruiser firing at the helpless &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, then closed to and fired for ten minutes at a heavier and better-armed opponent, possibly &quot;Haguro&quot;, scoring numerous hits.

At 08:40, a more pressing target appeared astern: seven Japanese destroyers in two columns, closing to attack the carriers. (This was the Tenth Destroyer Squadron, &quot;Yukikaze, Isokaze, Urakaze,&quot; and &quot;Nowaki&quot; led by the light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot;, which Hagen misidentified as a &quot;Terutsuki&quot;-class destroyer). Reversing course to intercept, Evans attempted to pass in front of the formation, crossing the &quot;T&quot; (a classic naval maneuver to limit the enemy ships&#x27; firepower). Evans ordered &quot;Johnston&quot;″s guns to fire on the Japanese destroyers, who returned fire striking &quot;Johnston&quot; several times. At 09:06 &quot;Yahagi&quot; turned away to the west to unmask her torpedo battery. Hagen presumed this was in response to his fire. From as close as , Hagen fired and claimed a dozen hits on the &quot;destroyer leader&quot; (&quot;Yahagi&quot;) before it veered off, &quot;Yahagi&quot;″s detailed action report records one. Hagen then shifted fire to the next destroyer in line, claiming five hits before it too turned away. At 09:20 the entire Tenth Destroyer Squadron turned west to fire their torpedoes from before turning east in response to Kurita&#x27;s recall order. Several torpedoes were detonated by strafing aircraft or defensive fire from the carriers, and the rest failed to strike a target.

The Japanese and the American ships were now intertwined in a confused jumble. The heavy smoke had made the visibility so poor by 08:40 &quot;Johnston&quot; nearly collided with &quot;Heerman&quot; while it crossed the formation to engage the Japanese destroyers, forcing &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; to evade them both. &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; and &quot;Hoel&quot; were sinking. Finding targets was not difficult. After 09:00, with &quot;Hoel&quot; and &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; out of the fight, the crippled &quot;Johnston&quot; was an easy target. She exchanged fire with four cruisers and numerous destroyers.

&quot;Johnston&quot; continued to take hits from the Japanese, which knocked out the number one gun mount, killing many men. By 09:20, forced from the bridge by exploding ammunition, Evans commanded the ship from the stern by shouting orders down to men manually operating the rudder. Shellfire knocked out the remaining engine, leaving &quot;Johnston&quot; dead in the water at 09:40. Her attackers concentrated their fire on her rather than the fleeing carriers. &quot;Johnston&quot; was hit so many times that one survivor recalled &quot;they couldn&#x27;t patch holes fast enough to keep her afloat.&quot;

At 09:45, Evans finally gave the order to abandon ship. &quot;Johnston&quot; sank 25 minutes later with 186 of her crew. Evans abandoned ship with his crew, but was never seen again. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. As the Japanese destroyer cruised slowly nearby, Robert Billie and several other crewmen saw her captain salute the sinking &quot;Johnston&quot;.

====USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;====
Although destroyer escorts were conceived as inexpensive small ships that could protect slow cargo convoys against submarines, they retained a basic anti-ship capability with torpedoes and guns. distinguished herself in this battle as the &quot;destroyer escort that fought like a battleship&quot; combating armored cruisers (which were designed to withstand 5-inch gunfire). Around 07:40, Lieutenant Commander Robert W. Copeland maneuvered his small ship to evade the charging &quot;Heermann&quot;; watching that destroyer approach the enemy, Copeland realized his own ship&#x27;s heading and location put it in a textbook position to launch a torpedo attack at the leading heavy cruiser. Over his ship&#x27;s 1MC public-address circuit, he told his crew &quot;This will be a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected. We will do what damage we can.&quot; Without orders and indeed against orders, he set course at full speed to follow &quot;Heermann&quot; in to attack the cruisers.

Under the cover of the smokescreen from the destroyers, &quot;Roberts&quot; escaped detection. Not wanting to draw attention to his small ship, Copeland repeatedly denied his gun captain permission to open fire with the guns; even though targets were clearly visible and in range, he intended to launch torpedoes at . A stray shell, probably intended for one of the nearby destroyers, hit &quot;Roberts&quot;″s mast which fell and jammed the torpedo mount at 08:00. Finally recovering, at , &quot;Roberts&quot; launched her torpedoes at &quot;Chōkai&quot; without being fired upon. Quickly reversing course, &quot;Roberts&quot; disappeared into the smoke. A lookout reported at least one torpedo hit, but in reality the &quot;Chōkai&quot; was not hit by a torpedo.

By 08:10, &quot;Roberts&quot; was nearing the carrier formation. Through the smoke and rain, the heavy cruiser &quot;Chikuma&quot; appeared, firing broadsides at the carriers. Copeland changed course to attack and told his gun captain, &quot;Mr Burton, you may open fire.&quot; &quot;Roberts&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; began to trade broadsides. &quot;Chikuma&quot; now divided her fire between the carriers and &quot;Roberts&quot;. Hampered by the closing range and slow rate of fire, &quot;Chikuma&quot; fired with difficulty at her small, fast opponent. (Early in the battle, when it had become apparent that &quot;Roberts&quot; would have to defend the escort carriers against a surface attack, chief engineer Lt. &quot;Lucky&quot; Trowbridge bypassed all the engine&#x27;s safety mechanisms, enabling &quot;Roberts&quot; to go as fast as .) &quot;Roberts&quot; did not share &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s problem of slow rate of fire. For the next 35 minutes, from as close as , her guns would fire almost her entire supply of ammunition on board—over 600 rounds. However, unknown to the crew of &quot;Roberts&quot;, shortly after &quot;Roberts&quot; engaged &quot;Chikuma&quot;, &quot;Heermann&quot; also aimed her guns at the cruiser.

However, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was not alone, and soon, the Japanese fleet&#x27;s multicolored salvos were bracketing &quot;Roberts&quot;, indicating that she was under fire from &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Nagato&quot;, and &quot;Haruna&quot;. In a desperate bid to avoid approaching shells, Copeland ordered full back, causing the salvo to miss. Now, however, his small ship was an easy target, and at 08:51, cruiser shells found their mark, damaging one of her boilers. At , &quot;Roberts&quot; began to suffer hits regularly. Credit is given to &quot;Kongō&quot; for striking the final decisive blows at 09:00, which knocked out her remaining engine. Dead in the water and sinking, &quot;Roberts&quot;″s part in the battle was over.

Gunner&#x27;s Mate Paul H. Carr was in charge of the aft gun mount, which had fired nearly all of its 325 stored rounds in 35 minutes before a breech explosion caused by the gun&#x27;s barrel overheating. Carr was found dying at his station, begging for help loading the last round he was holding into the breech. He was awarded a Silver Star, and the guided-missile frigate was later named for him. The guided-missile frigates and were named for the ship and its captain.

Companion destroyer escorts , , and also launched torpedoes. While they missed, this helped slow the Japanese chase. &quot;Dennis&quot; was struck by a pair of cruiser shells, and &quot;John C. Butler&quot; ceased fire after expending her ammunition an hour into the engagement.

====USS &quot;Hoel&quot;====
The fast destroyer , captained by Commander Leon S. Kintberger, was the flagship of the small destroyer and destroyer escort screen of Taffy 3. As splashes from Japanese shells began bracketing the ships of the task group, &quot;Hoel&quot; started zig-zagging and laying smoke to help defend the now fleeing CVEs. When the Japanese had closed to , Kintberger opened fire, and was in turn targeted by the Japanese. &quot;Yamato&quot;″s guns scored a hit on &quot;Hoel&quot;″s bridge at , knocking out all voice radio communication, killing four men and wounding Kintberger and Screen Flag Officer Commander William Dow Thomas.

Admiral Sprague then ordered Thomas to attack the Japanese with torpedoes. From his position on the damaged &quot;Hoel&quot;, he formed up the three destroyers of his command as best he could and at 07:40 ordered &quot;Line up and let&#x27;s go.&quot; Through rain showers and smoke, &quot;Hoel&quot; zig-zagged toward the Japanese fleet, followed by &quot;Heermann&quot; and &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;.

Kintberger now had to choose a target quickly as the distance closed rapidly. In the Combat Information Center, Executive Officer Fred Green quickly suggested a course that would put &quot;Hoel&quot; in a position to attack the leading &quot;battleship&quot;, either &quot;Kongō&quot; or possibly the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;. Without hesitation, Kintberger ordered &quot;Hoel&quot; in. The course took the ship into the middle of the charging Center Force.

Gunnery Officer Lt. Bill Sanders directed &quot;Hoel&quot;″s main battery of five guns in a rapid-fire barrage, drawing the attention of a substantial portion of the Japanese fleet. Soon shells of all calibers were straddling the destroyer.

Sometime near 07:27, at a range of , &quot;Hoel&quot; fired a half salvo of torpedoes and reversed course. The results of this salvo were not observed, the historian Morison claims that &quot;Haguro&quot; was forced to turn sharply away from the torpedo attack and dropped out of the lead to behind &quot;Tone&quot;, an assertion that is contradicted by &quot;Haguro&quot;″s detailed action report, which records turning to engaging an &quot;enemy cruiser&quot; (&quot;Hoel&quot;) at , but not a torpedo attack.

Moments after &quot;Hoel&quot; loosed her first half salvo, a devastating series of multi-caliber shells struck &quot;Hoel&quot; in rapid succession, disabling all the primary and secondary battery weapons aft of the second stack, stopping her port engine and depriving her of her Mark-37 fire control director, FD radar, and bridge steering control. His ship slowing to 17 knots under hand steering, Kintberger realized he would have to fire his remaining torpedoes quickly while he still could.

Heading southwest after his initial torpedo attack, Commander Kintberger turned west and launched his second torpedo salvo at a &quot;Heavy Cruiser&quot; (probably &quot;Yamato&quot; or &quot;Haruna&quot;, both sides having difficulty with target identification in the poor visibility) at approximately 07:50. This time, &quot;Hoel&quot;″s crew were rewarded by what appeared to be the sight of large columns of water alongside their target. The torpedo hits could not be confirmed, however. The water spouts were probably near misses by bombs. Japanese action reports reveal that &quot;Hoel&quot;″s target was probably &quot;Yamato&quot;, which turned hard to port to evade a torpedo salvo at 07:54 and was forced to run north until the torpedoes ran out of fuel, taking Kurita out of the battle and causing him to lose track of his forces.

&quot;Hoel&quot; was now crippled and surrounded by the enemy, with her speed reduced to 17 knots. Within a few minutes, steerage had been restored from the aft steering room. Kintberger ordered a course south towards Taffy 3. In the process of fishtailing and zig-zagging, she fired at the closest enemy ships with her two remaining guns. Finally at roughly 08:30, after withstanding over 40 hits from guns, an shell disabled her remaining engine. With her engine room underwater and No. 1 magazine ablaze, the ship began listing to port, settling by the stern. The order to abandon ship was given at 08:40, and many of her surviving crew swam away from the ship.

A Japanese cruiser and several destroyers closed to within , giving the two forward gun crews, under Gun Captain Chester Fay, a large, close target. For about ten minutes, they traded salvos with the &quot;Tone&quot;-class cruiser. When the destroyers slowed and approached to about , they were also fired upon. The Japanese fire only stopped at 08:55 when &quot;Hoel&quot; rolled over and sank in of water, after enduring 90 minutes of punishment.

&quot;Hoel&quot; was the first of Taffy 3&#x27;s ships to sink, and suffered the heaviest proportional losses: only 86 of her complement survived; 253 officers and men died with their ship. Commander Kintberger, who would live to retire a rear admiral, described the courageous devotion to duty of the men of &quot;Hoel&quot; in a seaman&#x27;s epitaph: &quot;Fully cognizant of the inevitable result of engaging such vastly superior forces, these men performed their assigned duties coolly and efficiently until their ship was shot from under them.&quot;

====USS &quot;Heermann&quot;====
—captained by Commander Amos T. Hathaway was on the disengaged side of the carriers at the start of the fight when at 07:37 he received an order from Commodore Thomas to take the lead position in a column of &quot;small boys&quot; to attack the approaching enemy fleet. &quot;Heermann&quot; steamed into the action at flank speed through the formation of &quot;baby flattops&quot; through smoke and intermittent rain squalls that had reduced visibility at times to less than , twice having to back emergency full to avoid collisions with friendly ships, first with &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; and then at 07:49 with &quot;Hoel&quot;, as she tried to take her assigned position at the head of the column in preparation for a torpedo attack.

At 07:50, &quot;Heermann&quot; engaged the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot; with her guns, while hurriedly preparing a half-salvo torpedo attack. In the confusion of battle, the torpedoman on the second torpedo mount mistakenly fired two extra torpedoes at the same time as the number one mount before he was stopped by the mount captain. After firing seven torpedoes, &quot;Heermann&quot; changed course to engage a column of three battleships that had commenced firing upon her.

Hathaway may now have been responsible for causing a series of events that may have had a decisive influence on the outcome of the battle. He directed gunfire on the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot;, the column&#x27;s leader. Then, he quickly closed to a mere and fired his last three torpedoes. &quot;Haruna&quot; evaded all of them, but historian Samuel Eliot Morison asserts that &quot;Yamato&quot; was bracketed between two of &quot;Heermann&quot;″s torpedoes on parallel courses, and for 10 minutes was forced to head north away from the action, while Lundgren, based on a comparison of both Japanese and American sources, asserts that the torpedoes came from &quot;Hoel&quot;″s second salvo fired at 07:53. In either case, Kurita and his most powerful ship were temporarily out of the action.

At 08:03, believing that one of the torpedoes had hit the battleship, Hathaway set course for the carrier formation, zigzagging and under the cover of smoke. Still undamaged, &quot;Heermann&quot; was able to fire through the smoke and rain at nearby targets. Now under continuous fire, &quot;Heermann&quot; began an unequal duel with &quot;Nagato&quot;, whose salvos were beginning to land uncomfortably close. At one point between 08:08 and 08:25, &quot;Heermann&quot; was within throwing distance of a Japanese destroyer for several minutes, before being separated by the smoke. During this time, neither ship fired on the other, both having higher-priority targets.

At 08:26, Commander Thomas requested covering fire on the cruisers firing on the CVEs from the east. Hathaway responded but first had to pass through the formation of carriers and escorts. This task proved hazardous. Traveling at flank speed, &quot;Heermann&quot; again had two near misses, this time with &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; and &quot;Johnston&quot;.

Finally on course for the enemy cruisers, &quot;Heermann&quot; came upon the heavily damaged &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; which was being pummeled at point-blank range. At , &quot;Heermann&quot; engaged &quot;Chikuma&quot; as her guns cleared &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;. During this phase of the battle, &quot;Heermann&quot; came under fire from the bulk of the Japanese fleet. Colored splashes of red, yellow, and green indicated that she was being targeted by &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot;. Many uncolored splashes were also observed, likely from the line of heavy cruisers being led by &quot;Chikuma&quot;. At 08:45, a hit on &quot;Heermann&quot;″s wheelhouse killed three men outright and fatally wounded another. A series of shell hits flooded the forward part of the destroyer, pulling her bow down so far that her anchors were dragging in the water, and one of her guns was knocked out.

At 08:50, aircraft from VC-10 approached the scene and were vectored via VHF by Taffy 3 to the cruisers to the east. By 08:53, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and the rest of the four heavy cruisers were under heavy air attack. At 09:02, under the combined effort of &quot;Heermann&quot;, &quot;Roberts&quot;, and the bombs, torpedoes, and strafing from the carrier-based planes, during this time &quot;Chikuma&quot; was immobilized by an aerial bomb, and was later scuttled when Center Force moved north.

At 09:07, the heavy cruiser &quot;Tone&quot; exchanged fire with &quot;Heermann&quot; until she too turned away at 09:10. By 09:17, Sprague ordered Hathaway to lay smoke on the port quarter of the CVEs, and by 09:30, the group had reformed in its normal formation and was headed southward.

Due to a multitude of factors, including the fear that they were engaging a large surface force and a cryptic message from Ozawa&#x27;s force signaling for a battle north, Kurita gave a &quot;cease action&quot; order at 09:00, with instructions to rendezvous north. Thus, unexpectedly, the Japanese began to disengage and turned away.

Though extensively damaged, &quot;Heermann&quot; was the only destroyer from the screen to survive.

===The Run to the South (07:30 to 09:45)===

Temporarily safe within the rain squall, Admiral Sprague had a difficult decision to make. The easterly course was drawing the enemy too close to San Bernardino Strait and away from any help that might come from Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s forces to the south, and Kurita was about to gain the windward side of his formation, which would render his smoke less effective. Consequently, at 07:30 Sprague ordered a course change, first to the southeast and then to the south, and ordered his escorts to make their torpedo attack to cover the carrier&#x27;s emergence from the storm. That was a very risky decision for Sprague because it gave Kurita a chance to cut across the diameter of Sprague&#x27;s arc and cut him off.

However, Kurita missed the chance and his forces followed Taffy 3 around the circle, his earlier decision to send his destroyers to the rear having removed them from a position that they could have intercepted or prevented the American formation&#x27;s turn. The escort carriers of Taffy 3 turned south and withdrew through shellfire at their top speed of . The six carriers dodged in and out of rain squalls, occasionally turning into the wind to launch the few planes they had left.

After one hour, the Japanese had closed the chase to within of the carriers. That the carriers had managed to evade destruction reinforced the Japanese belief that they were attacking fast fleet carriers. The heavy clouds of black and white smoke generated by the Americans were now making target observation extremely difficult. At 08:00, Sprague ordered the carriers to &quot;open fire with pea-shooters when the range is clear.&quot; The stern chase was also advantageous for the sole anti-ship armament of small carriers was a single manually controlled stern-mounted gun as a stinger, though they were loaded with anti-aircraft shells. As anti-aircraft gunners observed helplessly, an officer cheered them by exclaiming, &quot;Just wait a little longer, boys, we&#x27;re suckering them into 40-mm range.&quot;

===Carriers under attack===
During the run to the east the ships had been battered by near-misses. At 08:05, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; was struck by an shell and the carriers started taking direct hits. However, the Japanese ships were firing armor-piercing (AP) shells, which often carried right through the unarmored escort carriers without detonating. Though CVEs were popularly known as &quot;Combustible Vulnerable Expendable&quot;, they would ultimately prove durable in first dodging and then absorbing heavy shell fire and in downing attacking &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes.

====USS &quot;White Plains&quot;====
When &quot;Yamato&quot; opened fire at 06:59 at an estimated range of , she targeted with her first four salvos. &quot;Yamato&quot;″s third salvo was a close straddle landing at 07:04. One shell from this salvo exploded beneath the turn of &quot;White Plains&quot; port bilge near frame 142, close to her aft (starboard) engine room. While the ship was not struck directly, the mining effect of the under-keel explosion severely damaged her hull, deranged her starboard machinery, and tripped all of the circuit breakers in her electrical network. Prompt and effective damage control restored power and communications within three minutes and she was able to remain in formation by overspeeding her port engine to compensate. The gout of black smoke resulting from the shock of the explosion convinced &quot;Yamato&quot; (and &quot;Nagato&quot;, which was also firing her main battery at &quot;White Plains&quot; at the time) that they had scored a direct hit and they shifted fire to other targets. The turn to the south put &quot;White Plains&quot; in the lead of the formation and she escaped any further hits from Japanese fire.

During the surface phase of the action, &quot;White Plains&quot;″s gun crew claimed six hits on heavy cruiser , although these are not verified by Japanese officers.

====USS &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;====
As Japanese gunners concentrated on the closest target, effectively diverted attention from the other fleeing carriers. At 08:10, &quot;Chikuma&quot; closed to within and finally landed hits on the flight deck of &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, which was the most exposed. However, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Samuel B Robert&quot; engaged in a gunfight shortly afterwards, and &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was not targeted by any cruisers for the rest of the battle. 

However, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; promptly became the target of the Japanese battleships. &quot;Yamato&quot; opened fire at 22,000 yards, scoring a hit on her first salvo as an 18.1-inch (46 cm) round punched through her hanger bay. &quot;Haruna&quot; opened fire at 17,000 yards, while &quot;Kongō&quot; fired at 30,000 yards. At 8:20, one of &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; 18.1-inch (46 cm) shells from 20,000 yards flooded &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; engine room, leaving her dead in the water, and as covering destroyers distracted &quot;Kongo&quot; and &quot;Haruna, Yamato&#x27;s&quot; main battery continued to pound &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, hitting the flat top over 15 additional times, before &quot;Yamato&quot; ceased fire by 8:40. Dead in the water and succumbing to flooding damage, the abandoned ship order was issued as &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; capsized at 9:07, then fully slipped beneath the waves four minutes later. 130 crewmen were killed. The majority of her nearly 800 survivors were rescued two days later by landing and patrol craft dispatched from Leyte Gulf. &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was the only U.S. carrier sunk by naval gunfire in World War II.

US sources attributed cruiser gunfire to Gambier Bay&#x27;s loss, when no cruisers were firing on &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; throughout the majority of her sinking, a common consensus among early naval historians was that the cruisers recognized their enemy as escort carriers and switched to high explosive shells. &quot;Chikuma&quot; initially fired on &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, but quickly switched fire to attacking destroyers and destroyer escorts, while &quot;Tone, Haguro,&quot; and &quot;Chōkai&quot; verifiably took aim at other escort carriers. The cruisers also never switched to high explosive shells, as evidenced by the damage inflicted to &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; and &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; by &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Haguro.&quot; &quot;Yamato&quot; fired AP shells that overpenetrated &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; hull without exploding, leading to waterline hits not causing as much damage as &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; crew would expect of a battleship caliber shell.

====USS &quot;St. Lo&quot;====
Straddled several times during the run to the east, escaped serious damage during the surface phase of the action. By 07:38 the Japanese cruisers approaching from &quot;St. Lo&quot;″s port quarter had closed to within . &quot;St. Lo&quot; responded to their salvos with rapid fire from her single gun, claiming three hits on a &quot;Tone&quot;-class cruiser. At 10:00, she launched an Avenger armed with a torpedo to join the attack launched by &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; at 10:13. At 10:51 Lt. Yukio Seki, leader of the &quot;Shikishima&quot; squadron of the Special Attack Unit, crashed his A6M &quot;Zero&quot; into her flight deck from astern in the first organized &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack. The resulting explosions and fires within her hangar forced Captain Francis McKenna to order abandon ship at 11:00. &quot;St. Lo&quot; capsized and sank at 11:25 with the loss of 114 men. Six Grumman FM-2 Wildcat fighters and five Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers went down with &quot;St. Lo&quot;.

====USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;====
As the trailing ship in the escort carrier van after the turn to the south, came under intense enemy fire. Though partially protected by smoke, a timely rain squall, and counterattacks by the screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, she took the first of fifteen direct hits at 07:50 when from nearly 17,000 yards, &quot;Haruna&quot; struck &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; with a 14-inch (356 mm) shell the starboard side of the hangar deck just aft of the forward elevator.

By 08:00 two Japanese heavy cruisers, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Haguro,&quot; had closed to within . &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; responded to their straddling salvos with her gun. Three armor-piercing projectiles struck her within minutes. At 08:25, the carrier managed to score two direct hits with her 5-inch (127 mm) guns to &quot;Haguro&quot; from , neither of which caused any damage. &quot;Haguro&quot; was hit by two bombs which disabled her turret 2, which gave the appearance they caused more damage than she actually inflicted. &quot;Haguro&quot; temporarily withdrew, later helping to sink &quot;Hoel&quot;, while &quot;Tone&quot; switched fire to &quot;Heermann&quot;, temporarily relieving &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; of enemy fire. 

However, at 8:30 she was soon attacked by the light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot; leading the destroyers &quot;Yukikaze, Isokaze, Urakaze,&quot; and &quot;Nowaki&quot;, which steamed over the horizon off her starboard quarter. They fired a spread of 24 from about . One of these torpedoes came very close to hitting &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;, but it was intercepted and destroying by strafing runs. As screening ships engaged the cruisers and laid down concealing smoke, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; shifted her fire and engaged the destroyer flotilla, but they disengaged. &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; would not get a break as &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot; had regrouped and engaged yet again, gouging Kalinin Bay with another eleven 8-inch (203 mm) shell hits. One shell passed through the flight deck and into the communications area and destroyed all the radar and radio equipment. Most of the hits occurred after 08:45 when &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot; had closed to within . &quot;Kalinin bay&quot; would have sunk had these shells exploded and not over penetrated her hull, as the Japanese were still under the impression they were engaging full sized fleet carriers.

At 09:15, an Avenger from &quot;St. Lo&quot;—piloted by Lieutenant (j.g.) Waldrop—strafed and exploded two torpedoes in &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;″s wake about astern of her. A shell from the latter&#x27;s gun deflected a third from a collision course with her stern. At about 09:30, as the Japanese ships fired parting salvos and reversed course northward. Five minutes later, she ceased fire and retired southward with the other survivors of Taffy 3.

Around 10:50, the task unit came under a concentrated air attack. During the 40-minute battle, the first attack from a &quot;kamikaze&quot; unit in World War II, all escort carriers but &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; were damaged. Four diving planes attacked &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; from astern and the starboard quarter. Two were shot down when close, but the third crashed into the port side of the flight deck, damaging it severely, and the fourth destroyed the aft port stack. &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; suffered extensive structural damage during the morning&#x27;s intense action, and sixty casualties including five dead. Fifteen direct shell hits and two Kamikazes and two large-caliber near misses were confirmed. The two near-misses exploded under her counter, and were the severest threats to the ship&#x27;s survival.

====USS &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;====
Straddled several times early in the surface action during the run to the east as she was at the rear of the formation alongside &quot;White Plains&quot;, was towards the front of the formation after the turn to the south and escaped serious damage. At 10:13 she launched five Avengers (four armed with torpedoes, one with bombs) to attack the retreating Japanese. The five (along with one from &quot;St. Lo&quot;) attacked &quot;Yamato&quot; at 10:35 without result (according to Kitkun Bay and Chikuma&#x27;s Wikipedia pages and Chikuma&#x27;s Combined Fleet record, the TBMs actually attacked Chikuma, not Yamato). Attacked by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; at 11:08, she was successfully defended by her own and &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s anti-aircraft batteries. She was the only one of Sprague&#x27;s carriers to escape undamaged (this information seems to be incorrect, refer to Kitkun Bay&#x27;s page for more detailed information).
====USS &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;====
Targeted by &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; early in the action (red, yellow and blue shell splashes) Sprague&#x27;s flagship escaped serious damage during the run to the east and was on the far side of the formation across from &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; during the run to the south. During the later &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, the &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; took a near-miss &quot;kamikaze&quot; close aboard, helped shoot down a plane just about to crash into &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, and landed planes from her sunk or damaged sisters. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; suffered four dead and four wounded.

===Battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;===
 engaged enemy surface forces for the first and only time at Samar, entering the battle two meters down by the bow and limited to 26 knots due to 3,000 tons of flooding caused by three armor-piercing bombs during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. &quot;Yamato&quot; opened the battle at 06:59, firing on USS &quot;White Plains&quot; at an estimated range of , severely damaging &quot;White Plains&quot; with a near miss from her third salvo. The resulting gout of smoke from the stricken carrier obscured the target and convinced &quot;Yamato&quot; she was destroyed, so they ceased fire at 07:09. At 07:27, &quot;Yamato&quot; reported main and secondary battery hits on an &quot;enemy cruiser&quot; at , the time, range and bearing of which all correspond with the hits on the destroyer &quot;Johnston&quot;. At 07:51, she turned her secondary battery on USS &quot;Raymond&quot; at a range of before steering hard to port to avoid a torpedo salvo from the charging USS &quot;Hoel&quot; at 07:54. At 07:55, &quot;Yamato&quot; opened fire on &quot;Hoel&quot; with her anti-aircraft guns and was struck by an American 5-inch shell in return. Hemmed in by &quot;Haruna&quot; to starboard and her destroyers to port &quot;Yamato&quot; was forced to run due north away from the battle until the torpedoes ran out of fuel, finally turning back at 08:12.

At 08:23 &quot;Yamato&quot;″s F1M2 &quot;Pete&quot; floatplane reported a primary battery hit on &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; though this hit was also claimed by &quot;Kongō&quot;. &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;″s own records report a damaging near miss from a battleship-caliber shell around this time. At 08:34 &quot;Yamato&quot; trained her secondary batteries on another &quot;light cruiser&quot;, probably USS &quot;Hoel&quot;, which was observed sinking at 08:40. At 08:45 &quot;Yamato&quot; sighted three of the American carriers, US smoke screens preventing her from seeing the entire US formation. Between 09:06 and 09:17 &quot;Yamato&quot; received multiple strafing and torpedo attacks from US aircraft, claiming one US aircraft shot down at 09:15. Fighter pilot Lieutenant Richard W. Roby reportedly attacked destroyers before raking the decks and then bridge of &quot;Yamato&quot; with his machine guns, further discouraging her. However, US reports that &quot;Yamato&quot; closed to within of the American ships before she was attacked by American aircraft are not supported by &quot;Yamato&quot;″s own action report. At 09:11, Kurita ordered his ships to regroup to the north and at 09:22 &quot;Yamato&quot; slowed to 20 knots and came round to course 040, finally setting course 000 (due north) at 09:25. Kurita reported that his force had sunk two carriers, two cruisers, and some destroyers, apparently assuming that &quot;Yamato&quot; had indeed sunk &quot;White Plains&quot; with her first four salvoes. Kurita&#x27;s forces had actually sunk one carrier, two destroyers, and one destroyer escort, and &quot;Yamato&quot;″s guns likely contributed to the sinking of three out of four, with claimed hits (some unconfirmed or disputed) on all except &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;.
=== Japanese losses ===
&#x27;s detailed action report states that &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s immobilizing damage resulted from a bomb hit at 08:51, she was later scuttled by torpedoes from Japanese destroyers as she could not join the retreat, confirmed by other officers of Center Force.

&quot;Kumano&quot;″s bow was blown off by a torpedo from USS &quot;Johnston&quot;, and she retired toward the San Bernardino Strait, where she suffered further, minor, damage from an aerial attack.
Cruiser engaged the U.S. escort carriers, helping to sink &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, but came under attack from &quot;Heermann&quot;. &quot;Chikuma&quot; inflicted severe damage on &quot;Heermann&quot;, but was soon attacked in an anvil approach by four TBM Avenger torpedo-bombers. Richard Deitchman, flying from , succeeded in hitting her stern port quarter with a Mark 13 torpedo that severed her stern and disabled her port screw and rudder. &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s speed dropped to , then to , but more seriously, she became unsteerable. At 11:05, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was attacked by five TBMs from . She was hit portside amidships by two torpedoes and her engine rooms flooded. At 14:00, three TBMs from a composite squadron of aircraft from and led by Lt. Joseph Cady dropped more torpedoes which hit &quot;Chikuma&quot; portside. Cady was later awarded the Navy Cross for his action. arrived and took off survivors from the cruiser; &quot;Chikuma&quot; then sank in the late morning of October 25, 1944.

While withdrawing from the battle area, &quot;Nowaki&quot; was herself sunk, with the loss of all but one of &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s surviving crewmen, it is unknown how the &quot;Nowaki&quot; was lost and is still a topic of research today.

The heavy cruiser , which had also engaged the carriers, received fatal damage from the air, although not hit directly. Early in the battle, she was attacked by ten Avengers from Taffy 3. A near-miss close astern to port by an HE bomb from one of the TBMs carried away one of &quot;Suzuya&quot;″s propellers, reducing her maximum speed to 20 knots. At 10:50, she was attacked by 30 more carrier aircraft. Another near miss by a bomb, this time starboard amidships, detonated a Long Lance torpedo loaded in one of her starboard tube mounts. The fires started by the explosion soon propagated to other torpedoes nearby and beyond, the subsequent explosions damaging one of the boilers and the starboard engine rooms. Abandon ship was ordered at 11:50, none too soon, as the fires set off the remaining torpedoes and her main magazines ten minutes later. &quot;Suzuya&quot; rolled over and sank at 13:22. 401 officers and crew were rescued by destroyer , followed by further rescues by American ships.

===Kurita withdraws===
Although Kurita&#x27;s battleships had not been seriously damaged, the air and destroyer attacks had broken up his formations, and he had lost tactical control. His flagship &quot;Yamato&quot; had been forced to turn north in order to avoid torpedoes, causing him to lose contact with much of his task force. The determined, concentrated sea and air attack from Taffy 3 had already sunk or crippled the heavy cruisers &quot;Chōkai&quot;, &quot;Kumano&quot;, and &quot;Chikuma&quot;, which seemed to confirm to the Japanese that they were engaging major fleet units rather than escort carriers and destroyers. Kurita was at first not aware that Halsey had already taken the bait and that his battleships and carriers were far out of range. The ferocity of the renewed air attacks further contributed to his confusion and reinforced his suspicion that Halsey&#x27;s aircraft carriers were nearby. Signals from Ozawa eventually convinced Kurita that he was not currently engaged with the entirety of Third Fleet, and that the remaining elements of Halsey&#x27;s forces might close in and destroy him if he lingered too long in the area.

Finally, Kurita received word that the Southern Force that he was to meet had been destroyed the previous night. Calculating that the fight was not worth further losses and believing he had already sunk or damaged several American carriers, Kurita broke off the engagement at 09:20 with the order: &quot;all ships, my course north, speed 20.&quot; He set a course for Leyte Gulf but became distracted by reports of another American carrier group to the north. Preferring to expend his ships against capital ships, rather than transports, he turned north after the non-existent enemy fleet and ultimately withdrew back through the San Bernardino Strait.

As he retreated north and then west through the San Bernardino Strait, the smaller and heavily damaged American force continued to press the battle. While watching the Japanese retreat, Admiral Sprague heard a nearby sailor exclaim, &quot;Damn it, boys, they&#x27;re getting away!&quot;

===Seventh Fleet&#x27;s calls for help===
Shortly after 08:00, desperate messages calling for assistance began to come in from Seventh Fleet. One from Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, sent in plain language, read, &quot;My situation is critical. Fast battleships and support by airstrikes may be able to keep enemy from destroying CVEs and entering Leyte.&quot;

At 08:22, Kinkaid radioed, &quot;Fast Battleships are Urgently Needed Immediately at Leyte Gulf&quot;.

At 09:05, Kinkaid radioed, &quot;Need Fast Battleships and Air Support&quot;.

At 09:07, Kinkaid broadcast what his mismatched fleet was up against: &quot;4 Battleships, 8 Cruisers Attack Our Escort Carriers&quot;.

 away at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz had monitored the desperate calls from Taffy 3, and sent Halsey a terse message: &quot;Where is TF 34?&quot;. To complicate decryption, communications officers were to add a nonsense phrase at both ends of a message, in this case, prefixed with &quot;Turkey trots to water&quot; and suffixed with &quot;The world wonders.&quot; The receiving radioman repeated the &quot;where is&quot; section of this message and his staff failed to remove the trailing phrase &quot;the world wonders.&quot; A simple query by a distant supervisor had, through the random actions of three sailors, become a stinging rebuke.

Halsey was infuriated since he did not recognize the final phrase as padding, possibly chosen for the 90th anniversary of the Charge of the Light Brigade. He threw his hat to the deck and began to curse.

Halsey sent Task Group 38.1 (TG 38.1), commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain, to assist. Halsey recalled that he did not receive the vital message from Kinkaid until around 10:00 and later claimed that he had known that Kinkaid was in trouble but had not dreamed of the seriousness of the crisis. McCain, by contrast, had monitored Sprague&#x27;s messages and turned TG 38.1 to aid Sprague even before Halsey&#x27;s orders arrived (after prodding from Nimitz), putting Halsey&#x27;s defense in question.

At 10:05, Kinkaid asked, &quot;Who is guarding the San Bernardino Strait?&quot;

McCain raced toward the battle and briefly turned into the wind to recover returning planes. At 10:30, a force of Helldivers, Avengers, and Hellcats was launched from , , and at the extreme range of . Although the attack did little damage, it strengthened Kurita&#x27;s decision to retire.

At 11:15, more than two hours after the first distress messages had been received by his flagship, Halsey ordered TF 34 to turn around and head south to pursue Kurita, but the Japanese forces had already escaped.

Just hours after his perceived chastisement by Nimitz, Halsey&#x27;s forces destroyed all four enemy aircraft carriers he had pursued. However, despite the complete absence of Third Fleet against the main Japanese force, the desperate efforts of Taffy 3 and assisting task forces had driven back the Japanese. A relieved Halsey sent the following message to Nimitz, Kinkaid and General Douglas MacArthur at 12:26: &quot;It can be announced with assurance that the Japanese Navy has been beaten, routed and broken by the Third and Seventh Fleets.&quot;

===Survivors&#x27; ordeal===
Partly as a result of disastrous communication errors within Seventh Fleet and a reluctance to expose search ships to submarine attack, a very large number of survivors from Taffy 3, including those from &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, &quot;Hoel&quot;, &quot;Johnston&quot;, and &quot;Roberts&quot;, were not rescued until October 27, after two days adrift. A plane had spotted the survivors, but the location radioed back was incorrect. By then, many had died as a result of exposure, thirst and shark attacks. Finally, when a Landing Craft Infantry of Task Group 78.12 arrived, its captain used what is almost a standard method of distinguishing friend from foe, asking a topical question about a national sport, as one survivor, Jack Yusen, relates:
We saw this ship come up, it was circling around us, and a guy was standing up on the bridge with a megaphone. And he called out &#x27;Who are you? Who are you?&#x27; and we all yelled out &#x27;Samuel B. Roberts!&#x27; He&#x27;s still circling, so now we&#x27;re cursing at him. He came back and yelled &#x27;Who won the World Series?&#x27; and we all yelled &#x27;St. Louis Cardinals!&#x27; And then we could hear the engines stop, and cargo nets were thrown over the side. That&#x27;s how we were rescued.
==Aftermath==
The Japanese had succeeded in luring Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet away from its role of covering the invasion fleet, but the remaining light forces proved to be a very considerable obstacle. The force that Halsey had unwittingly left behind carried about 450 aircraft, comparable to the forces of five fleet carriers, although of less powerful types, and not armed for attacks on armored ships. The ships themselves, although slow and almost unarmed, in the confusion of battle and aided by weather and smokescreens, mostly survived. Their aircraft, although not appropriately armed, sank and damaged several ships, and did much to confuse and harass Center Force.

The breakdown in Japanese communications left Kurita unaware of the opportunity that Ozawa&#x27;s decoy plan had offered him. Kurita&#x27;s mishandling of his forces during the surface engagement further compounded his losses. Despite Halsey&#x27;s failure to protect the northern flank of the Seventh Fleet, Taffy 3 and assisting aircraft turned back the most powerful surface fleet Japan had sent to sea since the Battle of Midway. Domination of the skies, prudent and timely maneuvers by the U.S. ships, tactical errors by the Japanese admiral, and superior American radar technology, gunnery and seamanship all contributed to this outcome.

In addition, accurate anti-aircraft fire and air cover over US ships shot down several &quot;kamikaze&quot;s, while Center Force, lacking air cover, was vulnerable to air attack and was forced to constantly conduct evasive maneuvers while under air attack. Lastly, the attacking Japanese force initially used armor-piercing shells which were largely ineffective against unarmored ships as they passed right through without exploding; such munitions can be ineffective against thinly-armored naval targets such as destroyers or destroyer escorts.

Kurita and his officers knew they could not conduct a high-speed chase after the small force without a fleet oiler, and it contradicted with the original plan orders, which prioritized the landing forces over anything else. Kurita then received a cryptic message ordering him north, and in a unanimous decision with his officers ordered his force northward toward Ozawa&#x27;s force, where he thought a surface battle between the Northern Force and an American fleet was about to take place.

Clifton Sprague&#x27;s task unit lost two escort carriers: &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, to surface attack, and &quot;St. Lo&quot;, to &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack. Of the seven screening ships, fewer than half, two destroyers (&quot;Hoel&quot; and &quot;Johnston&quot;) and a destroyer escort (&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;), were lost, as were several aircraft. The other four U.S. destroyers and escorts were damaged. Although it was such a small task unit, over 1,500 Americans died, comparable to the losses suffered at the Allied defeat of the Battle of Savo Island off Guadalcanal, when four cruisers were sunk. It was also comparable to the combined losses of the 543 men and 3 ships at the Battle of the Coral Sea, and 307 men and 2 ships at the Battle of Midway.

On the other side of the balance sheet, the Japanese lost three heavy cruisers, and a fourth limped back to base seriously damaged, having lost its bow. All of Kurita&#x27;s battleships except &quot;Yamato&quot; suffered considerable damage, all of the other heavy ships stayed inactive in their bases, and the Japanese Navy, as a whole, had been rendered ineffective for the remainder of the war. Of the six U.S. ships, totaling , lost during Leyte Gulf operations, five were from Taffy 3. The Japanese lost 26 ships, totaling , in Leyte Gulf combat.

The battle took place in the very deep water above the Philippine Trench, with most sinkings in waters over deep. Wreckages that have been found include IJN &quot;Chōkai&quot; at nearly , USS &quot;Johnston&quot; at , and , the deepest wreck ever surveyed at a depth of , the USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;.

==Criticism of Halsey==
Halsey was criticized for his decision to take TF 34 north in pursuit of Ozawa and for failing to detach it when Kinkaid first appealed for help. A piece of U.S. Navy slang for Halsey&#x27;s actions is &quot;Bull&#x27;s Run&quot;, a phrase combining Halsey&#x27;s newspaper nickname &quot;Bull&quot; (in the U.S. Navy, the nickname &quot;Bull&quot; was used primarily by enlisted men, and Halsey&#x27;s friends and fellow officers called him &quot;Bill&quot;) with an allusion to the Battle of Bull Run in the American Civil War.

In his dispatch after the battle, Halsey gave reasons for his decision as follows:

Halsey also said that he had feared that leaving TF 34 to defend the strait without carrier support would have left it vulnerable to attack from land-based aircraft and leaving one of the fast carrier groups behind to cover the battleships would have significantly reduced the concentration of air power going north to strike Ozawa.

Morison writes in a footnote, &quot;Admiral Lee, however, said after the battle that he would have been only too glad to have been ordered to cover San Bernardino Strait without air cover.&quot; If Halsey had been in proper communication with Seventh Fleet, the escort carriers of TF 77 could have provided adequate air cover for TF 34, a much easier matter than it would be for those escort carriers to defend themselves against the onslaught of Kurita&#x27;s heavy ships.

It may be argued that the fact that Halsey was aboard one of the battleships and &quot;would have had to remain behind&quot; with TF 34 while the bulk of his fleet charged northwards to attack the Japanese carriers may have contributed to that decision. However, it would have been perfectly feasible and logical to have taken one or both of Third Fleet&#x27;s two fastest battleships, &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;, with the carriers in the pursuit of Ozawa, while leaving the rest of the Battle Line off San Bernardino Strait. (Indeed, Halsey&#x27;s original plan for the composition of TF 34 was that it would contain only four, not all six, of the Third Fleet&#x27;s battleships.) Therefore, to guard San Bernardino Strait with a powerful battleship force would have been compatible with Halsey&#x27;s personally going north aboard the &quot;New Jersey&quot;.

It seems likely that Halsey was strongly influenced by his chief of staff, Rear Admiral Robert &quot;Mick&quot; Carney, who was also wholeheartedly in favor of taking all Third Fleet&#x27;s available forces northwards to attack the Japanese carrier force.

Clifton Sprague, the commander of Task Unit 77.4.3 in the battle off Samar, was later bitterly critical of Halsey&#x27;s decision and of his failure to inform Kinkaid and the Seventh Fleet clearly that their northern flank was no longer protected:

Regarding Halsey&#x27;s failure to turn TF 34 southwards when Seventh Fleet&#x27;s first calls for assistance off Samar were received, Morison writes:

Morison also observes, &quot;The mighty gunfire of the Third Fleet&#x27;s Battle Line, greater than that of the whole Japanese Navy, was never brought into action except to finish off one or two crippled light ships.&quot; Perhaps the most telling comment was made laconically by Vice Admiral Willis Augustus Lee in his action report as the Commander of TF 34: &quot;No battle damage was incurred, nor inflicted on the enemy by vessels while operating as Task Force Thirty-Four.&quot;

In his master&#x27;s thesis submitted at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Lieutenant Commander Kent Coleman argues that the division of command hierarchies of the Third Fleet, under Halsey reporting to Admiral Nimitz, and Seventh Fleet, under Vice Admiral Kinkaid reporting to General MacArthur, was the primary contributor to the near-success of Kurita&#x27;s attack. Coleman concludes that &quot;the divided U.S. naval chain of command amplified problems in communication and coordination between Halsey and Kinkaid. This divided command was more important in determining the course of the battle than the tactical decision made by Halsey and led to an American disunity of effort that nearly allowed Kurita&#x27;s mission to succeed.&quot;

==Presidential Unit Citation==
Taffy 3 was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation:

For extraordinary heroism in action against powerful units of the Japanese Fleet during the Battle off Samar, Philippines, October 25, 1944. ... the gallant ships of the Task Unit waged battle fiercely against the superior speed and fire power of the advancing enemy, ... two of the Unit&#x27;s valiant destroyers and one destroyer escort charged the battleships point-blank and, expending their last torpedoes in desperate defense of the entire group, went down under the enemy&#x27;s heavy shells as a climax to two and one half hours of sustained and furious combat. The courageous determination and the superb teamwork of the officers and men who fought the embarked planes and who manned the ships of Task Unit 77.4.3 were instrumental in effecting the retirement of a hostile force threatening our Leyte invasion operations and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

==Legacy==
A number of ships were named after participants and ships from that battle, including , , , and , and . When struck a mine in 1988, her crew touched a plaque commemorating the original crew as they struggled to save the ship.

While the battle is frequently included in historical accounts of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the duels between the destroyer and destroyer escorts and &quot;Yamato&quot; and the Japanese force were the subject of a &quot;Dogfights&quot; television episode, &quot;Death of the Japanese Navy&quot;. That episode, as well as a History Channel documentary, was based on &quot;The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors&quot;, written by James D. Hornfischer. There was also an episode of &quot;Ultimate Warfare&quot; on American Heroes Channel called &quot;Courage at Sea&quot;.

The survivors formed associations which still meet annually, and raised funds to build memorials in San Diego near the current location of the Museum, which contains a model of &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;.

<text>Pinus glabra, the spruce pine, is a tree found on the coastal plains of the southern United States, from southern South Carolina south to northern Florida and west to southern Louisiana.

== Description ==
This pine is a straight-growing, medium-sized species, attaining heights of . The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of two, , slender (), and glossy dark green. The small, slender cones are , with weak prickles on the scales that are soon shed.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus glabra&quot; differs markedly from most other pines in that it does not occur in largely pure pine forests, but is typically found as scattered trees in moist woodland habitats in mixed hardwood forest. To be able to compete successfully in such habitats, it has adapted to greater shade tolerance than most other pines.

<text>The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (informally known as Punchbowl Cemetery) is a national cemetery located at Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu, Hawaii. It serves as a memorial to honor those men and women who served in the United States Armed Forces, and those who have been killed in doing so. It is administered by the National Cemetery Administration of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Millions of visitors visit the cemetery each year, and it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Hawaii.

==Location, construction and history==
Punchbowl Crater was formed some 75,000 to 100,000 years ago during the Honolulu period of secondary volcanic activity. A crater resulted from the ejection of hot lava through cracks in the old coral reefs which, at the time, extended to the foot of the Ko&#x27;olau Mountain Range.

Although there are various translations of the Punchbowl&#x27;s Hawaiian name, &quot;Puowaina,&quot; the most common is &quot;Hill of Sacrifice.&quot; This translation closely relates to the history of the crater. The first known use was as an altar where Hawaiians offered human sacrifices to pagan gods and the killed violators of the many taboos. Later, during the reign of Kamehameha the Great, a battery of two cannons was mounted at the rim of the crater to salute distinguished arrivals and signify important occasions. Early in the 1880s, leasehold land on the slopes of the Punchbowl opened for settlement and in the 1930s, the crater was used as a rifle range for the Hawaii National Guard. Toward the end of World War II, tunnels were dug through the rim of the crater for the placement of shore batteries to guard Honolulu Harbor and the south edge of Pearl Harbor.

During the late 1890s, a committee recommended that the Punchbowl become the site for a new cemetery to accommodate the growing population of Honolulu. The idea was rejected for fear of polluting the water supply and the emotional aversion to creating a city of the dead above a city of the living. Fifty years later, Congress authorized a small appropriation to establish a national cemetery in Honolulu with two provisions: that the location be acceptable to the War Department, and that the site would be donated rather than purchased. In 1943, the governor of Hawaii offered the Punchbowl for this purpose. The $50,000 appropriation proved insufficient, however, and the project was deferred until after World War II. By 1947, Congress and veteran organizations placed a great deal of pressure on the military to find a permanent burial site in Hawaii for the remains of thousands of World War II servicemen on the island of Guam awaiting permanent burial. Subsequently, the Army again began planning the Punchbowl cemetery.

In February 1948, Congress approved funding and construction began on the national cemetery. Since the cemetery was dedicated on September 2, 1949, approximately 53,000 World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War veterans and their dependents have been interred. The cemetery now almost exclusively accepts cremated remains for above-ground placement in columbaria; casketed and cremated remains of eligible family members of those already interred there may, however, be considered for burial.

Prior to the opening of the cemetery for the recently deceased, the remains of soldiers from locations around the Pacific Theater—including Guam, Wake Island, and Japanese POW camps—were transported to Hawaii for final interment. The first interment was made January 4, 1949. The cemetery opened to the public on July 19, 1949, with services for five war dead: an unknown serviceman, two Marines, an Army lieutenant and one noted civilian war correspondent Ernie Pyle. Initially, the graves at National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific were marked with white wooden crosses and Stars of David—like the American cemeteries abroad—in preparation for the dedication ceremony on the fourth anniversary of V-J Day. Eventually, over 13,000 soldiers and sailors who died during World War II would be laid to rest in the Punchbowl. Despite the Army&#x27;s extensive efforts to inform the public that the star- and cross-shaped grave markers were only temporary, an outcry arose in 1951 when permanent flat granite markers replaced them.

A new 25-bell carillon built by Schulmerich Carillons, Inc. was dedicated in 1956 during Veteran&#x27;s Day services. The carillon is nicknamed &quot;Coronation&quot; and was funded in part by the Pacific War Memorial Commission and individual contributions. Arthur Godfrey helped to raise funds.

The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific was the first such cemetery to install Bicentennial Medal of Honor headstones, the medal insignia being defined in gold leaf. On May 11, 1976, a total of 23 of these were placed on the graves of medal recipients, all but one of whom were killed in action.

In August 2001, about 70 generic &quot;Unknown&quot; markers for the graves of men known to have died during the attack on Pearl Harbor were replaced with markers that included after it was determined they perished on this vessel. In addition, new information that identified grave locations of 175 men whose graves were previously marked as &quot;Unknown&quot; resulted in the installation of new markers in October 2002.

The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific contains a &quot;Memorial Walk&quot; that is lined with a variety of memorial markers from various organizations and governments that honor America&#x27;s veterans. As of 2012, there were 60 memorial boulders (bearing bronze plaques) along the pathway. Additional memorials can be found throughout the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific—most commemorating soldiers of 20th-century wars, including those killed at Pearl Harbor.

===Updates and improvements===
In 2015, Congress allotted $25 million in funds for improvements, maintenance and expansion of the cemetery. The goal was to make the cemetery worth visiting for both tourists and local as well as highly advanced for the members and officers of the military.

The design-build project of this national cemetery consisted of many improvements both inside and outside including construction of the Memorial Wall, replacement of columbarium caps at courts 1–5 inside the cemetery, demolishing the existing Administration and PIC building, construction of Columbarium Court 13, which included 6,860 columbarium niches, repair of existing roadways, and replacement of existing signage, followed by site furnishing, landscaping, irrigation, and site utilities and achieving a LEED silver rating by the US Green Building Council.

The project was awarded to Nan Inc by the Department of Veterans Affairs for $25,100,445.

The cemetery is currently undergoing a major construction project to build additional columbarium space.

===The National Park service and National Memorial Cemetery===
During the Civil War, the U.S. government feared for the sanctity of the graves of fallen Union soldiers and issued General Orders No. 33, of April 3, 1862, Moving to give federal protection to Union grave sites pushing The Act of July 17, 1862, which gave the President the authority, “whenever in his opinion it shall be expedient, to purchase cemetery grounds and cause them to be securely enclosed, to be used as a national cemetery for the soldiers who shall die in the service of the country. To further protect the sites of fallen heroes congress approves of the &quot;Reburial Program&quot; on April 13, 1866, stating the Secretary of War is hereby authorized and required to take immediate measures to preserve the graves of soldiers of the United States who fell in battle and secure suitable burial places in which they may be properly interred; and to have the grounds enclosed, so that the resting-places of the honored dead may be kept sacred forever followed on February 22, 1867, with an “Act to establish and to protect National Cemeteries.” This was followed on July 1, 1870, by an Act of Congress authorizing the United States to take title to any national cemeteries where the States had given their consent, and on May 18, 1872, by an Act authorizing the Secretary of War to appoint superintendents. Still, more action was needed such as The Yosemite and Yellowstone Acts (1889,90), The Lacy Act (1900), The Antiquities Act (1906), and The Organic Act (1916) which leads to President Woodrow Wilson signing the act creating the National Park Service, a new federal bureau in the Department of the Interior on August 25, 1916, which encompasses all locations protected by the previous acts.

The National Park Service has managed national cemeteries since 1972 and all were transferred from the War Department to the Department of the Interior by Executive Order 6228 of July 28, 1933.

===&quot;Operation Glory&quot; and the Punchbowl Cemetery===
After their retreat in 1950, dead soldiers and Marines were buried at a temporary military cemetery near Hungnam, North Korea. During Operation Glory, which occurred from July to November 1954, the dead of each side were exchanged; remains of 4,167 US soldiers/Marines were exchanged for 13,528 North Korean/Chinese dead. In addition 546 civilians who died in United Nations prisoner of war camps were turned over to the South Korean Government. After &quot;Operation Glory&quot; 416 Korean War &quot;unknowns&quot; were buried in the Punchbowl Cemetery. According to one report, 1,394 names were also transmitted during &quot;Operation Glory&quot; from the Chinese and North Koreans (of which 858 names proved to be correct); of the 4,167 returned remains were found to be 4,219 individuals of whom 2,944 were found to be Americans of whom all but 416 were identified by name. Of 239 Korean War unaccounted for: 186 not associated with Punchbowl unknowns (176 were identified and of the remaining 10 cases four were non-Americans of Asiatic descent; one was British; three were identified and two cases unconfirmed). Fifty-seven years after the Korean War, remains of two of the &quot;Punchbowl unknowns&quot; were identified—both from the 1st Marine Division. One was Pfc. Donald Morris Walker of Support Company/1st Service Battalion/1st Marine Division who was KIA December 7, 1950 and the other was Pfc. Carl West of Weapons Company/1st Battalion/7th Regiment/1st Marine Division who was KIA December 10, 1950.

In 2011 remains of an unknown USAF pilot from Operation Glory were identified from the &quot;Punchbowl Cemetery&quot;; POW remains from &quot;Operation Glory&quot; were also identified in 2011.

From 1990 to 1994, North Korea excavated and turned over 208 sets of remains—possibly containing remains of 200–400 US servicemen—but few identifiable because of co-mingling of remains. In 2011 remains were identified.

From 1996 to 2006, 220 remains were recovered near the Chinese border. In 2008, a total of 63 were identified (26 World War II; 19 Korea; 18 Vietnam) (Among those identified: January 2008 remains of a Michigan soldier. In March 2008, remains of an Indiana soldier and an Ohio soldier were identified). According to a report June 24, 2008, of 10 Korean War remains disinterred from the &quot;Punchbowl Cemetery&quot; six have been identified. From January to April 2009, a total of twelve Unknowns have been identified—three from World War II; eight from Korean War; one from Vietnam. In 2011 remains returned in 2000 were identified.

===Wreaths Across America at the Punchbowl Cemetery===
On December 17, 2022, at 12:00 pm, the Women&#x27;s Marines Association HI-2 Wahine Koa Chapter will be helping the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (Punchbowl) to Remember and Honor our veterans by laying Remembrance wreaths on the graves of our country&#x27;s fallen heroes. WMA HI-2 Wahine Koa Chapter sponsors the event annually to honor and remember as many fallen heroes as possible by sponsoring remembrance wreaths and volunteering on Wreaths Day. Wreaths can be sponsored by donating at Wreaths Across America.

==Honolulu Memorial==
In 1964, the American Battle Monuments Commission erected the Honolulu Memorial at the National Memorial Cemetery &quot;to honor the sacrifices and achievements of American Armed Forces in the Pacific during World War II and in the Korean War&quot;. The memorial was later expanded in 1980 to include the Vietnam War. The names of 28,788 military personnel who are missing in action or were lost or buried at sea in the Pacific during these conflicts are listed on marble slabs in ten &quot;Courts of the Missing&quot; which flank the Memorial&#x27;s grand stone staircase.

The Honolulu Memorial is one of three war memorials in the United States administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission; the others are the East Coast Memorial to the Missing of World War II in New York and the West Coast Memorial to the Missing of World War II in San Francisco.

The dedication stone at the base of staircase is engraved with the following words:

:IN THESE GARDENS ARE RECORDED
:THE NAMES OF AMERICANS
:WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
:IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY
:AND WHOSE EARTHLY RESTING PLACE
:IS KNOWN ONLY TO GOD

At the top of the staircase in the Court of Honor is a statue of Lady Columbia, also known as Lady Liberty, or Justice. Here she is reported to represent all grieving mothers. She stands on the bow of a ship holding a laurel branch. The inscription below the statue, taken from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s letter to Mrs. Bixby, reads:

:THE SOLEMN PRIDE
:THAT MUST BE YOURS
:TO HAVE LAID
:SO COSTLY A SACRIFICE
:UPON THE ALTAR
:OF FREEDOM

===In popular culture===
The statue is featured in the opening sequence of both the 1970s television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and its 2010 remake. The latter series has also filmed at the cemetery several times—John McGarrett, the father of lead character Steve McGarrett, is a Vietnam War veteran and is buried there.

<doc id="521230" wikidata="Q597796" url="?curid=521230" title="Japanese battleship Hiei">
<text>was a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II. Designed by British naval architect George Thurston, she was the second launched of four s, among the most heavily armed ships in any navy when built. Laid down in 1911 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, &quot;Hiei&quot; was formally commissioned in 1914. She patrolled off the Chinese coast on several occasions during World War I, and helped with rescue efforts following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

Starting in 1929, &quot;Hiei&quot; was converted to a gunnery training ship to avoid being scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. She served as Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s transport in the mid-1930s. After the treaty fell apart in 1937, she underwent a full-scale reconstruction that completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her powerplant, and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan&#x27;s growing fleet of aircraft carriers, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. On the eve of the US entry into World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo&#x27;s Combined Fleet, escorting the six carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

As part of the Third Battleship Division, &quot;Hiei&quot; participated in many of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s early actions in 1942, providing support for the invasion of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) as well as the Indian Ocean raid of April 1942. During the Battle of Midway, she sailed in the Invasion Force under Admiral Nobutake Kondō, before being redeployed to the Solomon Islands during the Battle of Guadalcanal. She escorted Japanese carrier forces during the battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz Islands, before sailing as part of a bombardment force under Admiral Kondō during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. In the early hours of 13 November 1942, &quot;Hiei&quot; engaged American cruisers and destroyers alongside her sister ship . After inflicting heavy damage on American cruisers and destroyers, &quot;Hiei&quot; was crippled by shell hits from the heavy cruiser USS San Francisco that jammed her rudder. Subjected to a daylight air attack from the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, she was scuttled on the evening of 13 November 1942.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Hiei&quot; was the second of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s s, a line of capital ships designed by the British naval architect George Thurston. The class was ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of in 1908. The four battlecruisers of the &quot;Kongō&quot; class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the other major powers at the time; they have been called the battlecruiser versions of the British (formerly Turkish) battleship . With their heavy armament and armor protection (the latter of which made up 23.3% of their approximately 30,000 ton displacement), &quot;Hiei&quot; and her sister ships were vastly superior to any other Japanese capital ship afloat at the time.

The keel of &quot;Hiei&quot; was laid down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 4 November 1911, with most of the parts used in her construction manufactured in Britain. She was launched on 21 November 1912, and fitting-out began in December 1913. On 15 December 1913, Captain Shichitaro Takagi was assigned as her chief equipping officer. She was completed on 4 August 1914.

===Armament===
&quot;Hiei&quot;″s main battery consisted of eight heavy-caliber main guns in four twin turrets, two forward and two aft. The turrets were noted by the US Office of Naval Intelligence to be &quot;similar to the British 15-inch turrets&quot;, with improvements made in flash-tightness in the gun chambers. Each of her main guns could fire high-explosive or armor-piercing shells at a rate of two shells per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;14/45&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the Japanese doctrine of deploying more powerful vessels than their opponents, &quot;Hiei&quot; and her sister ships were the first vessels in the world equipped with guns. The main guns carried ammunition for ninety shots and had an approximate barrel-life of 250–280 shots.

Her secondary battery was originally sixteen 50-caliber medium guns in single casemates (all located amidships), eight guns and eight submerged torpedo tubes. The sixteen 6-inch/50 caliber guns were capable of firing between 5 and 6 rounds per minute, with a barrel life of 500 rounds. The 6-inch/50 caliber gun was capable of firing both antiaircraft and antiship shells, though the positioning of the guns on &quot;Hiei&quot; made antiaircraft firing impractical. The eight 5-inch/40 caliber guns added later could fire between 8 and 14 rounds per minute, with a barrel life of 800–1,500 rounds. These guns had the widest variety of shot type of &quot;Hiei&quot;″s guns, being designed to fire antiaircraft, antiship, and illumination shells. &quot;Hiei&quot; was also armed with a large number of Type 96 antiaircraft autocannons.

==Service==

===1914–1929: Battlecruiser===
On 4 August 1914, &quot;Hiei&quot; was formally commissioned and assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, before being attached to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet two weeks later. On 23 August 1914, Japan declared war on the German Empire, occupying the former German colonies in Palau and in the Caroline, Marshall and Mariana Islands. In October 1914, &quot;Hiei&quot; departed Sasebo alongside &quot;Kongō&quot; to support Imperial Japanese Army units in the Siege of Tsingtao, but she was recalled on 17 October. On 3 October 1915, &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kongō&quot; participated in the sinking of the target ship , a Russian pre-dreadnought captured in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War that had subsequently served in the Japanese Navy under the name as a coastal defense ship. In April 1916, she patrolled the Chinese coast with her newly launched sisters and . From 1917 to the end of World War I, &quot;Hiei&quot; remained primarily at Sasebo, patrolling the Chinese and Korean coasts with her sister ships on several occasions.

Following the end of World War I, the Japanese Empire gained control of former German possessions in the central Pacific per the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Due to Japan&#x27;s warm relations with the British Empire and the United States at the time, &quot;Hiei&quot; and other Japanese warships became significantly less active after the war. Other than a patrol alongside &quot;Haruna&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; off the Chinese coast in March 1919, &quot;Hiei&quot; remained in the Japanese home ports. On 13 October 1920, she was placed in reserve. Following the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923, the capital ships of the Japanese Navy assisted in rescue work until the end of the month. &quot;Hiei&quot; arrived at Kure Naval Base on 1 December 1923 for a refit which increased the elevation of her main guns from 20 to 33 degrees and rebuilt her foremast.

With the conclusion of World War I, the world powers attempted to stem any militarization that might re-escalate into war. Under the terms of Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, the Imperial Japanese Navy was significantly reduced, with a ratio of 5:5:3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. The treaty also banned Japan from building any new capital ships until 1931, with no capital ship permitted to exceed 35,000 tons. Provided that further additions did not exceed 3,000 tons, existing capital ships were allowed to be upgraded with improved torpedo bulges and deck armor. By the time the Washington Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan, only three classes of World War I-era capital ships—the and s, and the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers—remained active.

In July 1927, Crown Prince Takamatsu—Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s younger brother—was assigned to &quot;Hiei&quot;. From October to November 1927, the ship underwent a minor refit at Sasebo to accommodate two Yokosuka E1Y floatplanes, though no launch catapults were added. On 29 March 1928, &quot;Hiei&quot; departed Sasebo alongside &quot;Kongō&quot; and the battleships and to patrol off the Chusan Archipelago, before arriving in the company of &quot;Kongō&quot; in Port Arthur in April 1928. In October 1929, she returned to Kure in preparation for her demilitarization and reconstruction.

===1929–1937: Demilitarization and training ship===

To avoid having to scrap &quot;Hiei&quot; under the terms of the Washington Treaty, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to convert her into a demilitarized training ship. On 15 October 1929, she went into drydock at Kure Naval Arsenal. Her No. 4 gun turret was removed, and she was stripped of all eight of her submerged torpedo tubes, as well as her 6-inch guns and armor belt. All but nine of her boilers were taken out, reducing her speed to , and one of her three funnels was removed. She was reclassified as a reserve ship at the end of November 1929. On 24 April 1930, reconstruction was halted due to the signing of the London Naval Treaty, which further restricted battleship construction and possession amongst the great naval powers, and preservation work was begun at Sasebo. Reconstruction would not resume until July 1931.

In September 1931, Japanese army units invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria, transforming it into the puppet state of Manchukuo. In December 1932, &quot;Hiei&quot; was reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s training squadron. On 25 February, the League of Nations ruled that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty and international law in her invasion of Manchuria. Refusing to accept the League&#x27;s judgment, the Empire of Japan withdrew from the League the same day. This also signaled its exit from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which removed all restrictions on the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s construction of capital ships. From the end of May 1933 to 13 August, &quot;Hiei&quot; received upgrades that allowed her to perform regular duties for the Emperor, and she served as the Emperor&#x27;s observation ship for the Imperial Naval Review three days later. From January to March 1934, her No. 4 turret and ammunition magazine were refitted. In November 1935, &quot;Hiei&quot; served as the Emperor&#x27;s ship for his official visit to the Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures.

===1937–1941: Reconstruction and fast battleship===

No longer bound by the restrictions of the Washington and London Treaties, the Imperial Japanese Navy proceeded to reconstruct &quot;Hiei&quot; along the same lines as her sisters. She received eight new oil-fired Kampon boilers and geared turbines, while her stern was lengthened by to increase speed. Her aft 14-inch turret was refitted and fire control systems installed for all four main turrets. The elevation of her main and secondary guns was increased, and she was equipped with two Nakajima E8N &quot;Dave&quot; and Kawanishi E7K &quot;Alf&quot; reconnaissance floatplanes. To this end, catapults and launch-rails were also fitted aft of turret #3. Fourteen of her 6-inch guns were refitted, and an antiaircraft suite of eight 5-inch dual-purpose guns and ten twin mounts of Type 96 autocannons were mounted. Her superstructure was rebuilt as a prototype of the tower-mast that would eventually be used on the , then still in the design phase.

&quot;Hiei&quot;″s armor was also extensively upgraded. Her main belt was reapplied and strengthened to a uniform thickness of 8 inches (as opposed to varying thicknesses of 6–8 inches before the upgrades), while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from reinforced the main armored belt. The turret armor was strengthened to , while were added to portions of the deck armor. The armor around her ammunition magazines was also strengthened over the course of the refit. Though still less heavily armored than other Japanese battleships, &quot;Hiei&quot; was significantly faster. The reconstruction was declared complete on 31 January 1940. Capable of speeds of up to , &quot;Hiei&quot; was reclassified as a fast battleship. She participated in the Imperial Fleet Review in October 1940, where she was inspected by Emperor Hirohito, members of the royal family, Navy Minister Koshirō Oikawa, and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. In November, she was assigned to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet.

On 26 November 1941, &quot;Hiei&quot; departed Hitokappu Bay, Kurile Islands, in the company of &quot;Kirishima&quot; and six Japanese fast carriers of the First Air Fleet Striking Force (, , , , , and ) under the command of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo. On 7 December 1941, aircraft from these six carriers attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at their home base of Pearl Harbor, sinking four US Navy battleships and numerous other vessels. Following the attack and the declaration of war by the United States, &quot;Hiei&quot; returned to Japan.

===1942: Combat and loss===

On 17 January 1942, &quot;Hiei&quot; departed Truk Lagoon Naval Base with the Third Battleship Division to support carrier operations against Rabaul and Kavieng. In February, she deployed alongside a force of carriers and destroyers in response to American raids on Japanese bases in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. On 1 March, following carrier operations against Darwin and Java (in the Dutch East Indies), &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and —which were acting as escorts for the carrier task force—engaged the destroyer , with &quot;Hiei&quot; firing 210 14-inch and seventy 6-inch shells. When the ships failed to score any hits, dive-bombers from three of Admiral Nagumo&#x27;s carriers immobilized the destroyer, which was then finished off by gunfire from the three ships.

In April 1942, &quot;Hiei&quot; and the Third Battleship Division joined five fleet carriers and two cruisers in a massive raid against British naval forces in the Indian Ocean. On 5 April—Easter Sunday—the Japanese fleet attacked the harbor at Colombo, Ceylon while seaplanes from the cruiser spotted two fleeing British cruisers, both of which were later sunk by aerial attack. On 8 April, Japanese carrier aircraft attacked the Royal Navy base at Trincomalee, only to find that all of Admiral James Somerville&#x27;s remaining warships in the British Eastern Fleet had withdrawn the previous night. Returning from the attack, a floatplane from &quot;Hiei&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Haruna&quot; spotted the aircraft carrier , which was quickly sunk by massive aerial attack. The fleet then returned to Japan, arriving at the home bases on 23 April.

On 27 May 1942, &quot;Hiei&quot; sortied with &quot;Kongō&quot; and the heavy cruisers , , , and as part of Admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s Invasion Force during the Battle of Midway. Following the disastrous loss of four of the Combined Fleet&#x27;s fast carriers on 4 June, Kondō&#x27;s force withdrew to Japan. In July, &quot;Hiei&quot; was drydocked for refits to her aircraft complement and the addition of single and twin 25 mm gun mounts. In August, she escorted the Japanese carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot; during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. In October, &quot;Hiei&quot; sortied as part of Rear Admiral Abe&#x27;s Vanguard Force, and maintained distant cover as &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; nearly destroyed Henderson Field on Guadalcanal on the night of 13 October. From 26 to 30 October, &quot;Hiei&quot; and her sisters participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

=== Naval Battle of Guadalcanal ===
On 10 November 1942, &quot;Hiei&quot; departed Truk alongside &quot;Kirishima&quot; and eleven destroyers, all under the command of Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe, to shell American positions near Henderson Field in advance of a major convoy of Japanese troops. The force was spotted by US Navy reconnaissance aircraft several days in advance. The US deployed a force of two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and eight destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan to meet the Japanese force in Ironbottom Sound. At 01:24 on 13 November, the Japanese force was detected out by the light cruiser . Because Abe had not anticipated resistance, his battleships&#x27; main guns were loaded with anti-aircraft shells for bombarding Henderson Field. The initial salvos from the IJN battleships were thus not capable of dealing severe damage to the enemy&#x27;s vital armor protected hull, engines and gun turrets.

At 01:50, &quot;Hiei&quot; activated her searchlights and opened fire. &quot;Hiei&quot; engaged in a gunnery duel with the destroyer USS Monssen, and sank her with 39 hits, including three from her 14-inch (356 mm) guns. In turn, &quot;Hiei&quot; became the target of most of the American fire, with American 5&quot; guns inflicting severe damage on &quot;Hiei&quot;″s superstructure at close range. The destroyer found herself as close as 20 feet (6 meters) away from the battle wagon, and hit &quot;Hiei&quot;″s bridge, injuring Admiral Abe himself and killing his chief of staff, Captain Masakane Suzuki, followed closely by &quot;Hiei&quot; crippling &quot;Laffey&quot; with a 14-inch (356 mm) shell hit (later finished off by a torpedo from the destroyer Yukikaze).

The concentration on &quot;Hiei&quot; allowed &quot;Kirishima&quot; to evade attack, and she crippled , killing Admiral Callaghan. However, shells from &quot;San Francisco&quot; disabled &quot;Hiei&quot;″s steering machinery, leaving &quot;Hiei&quot; an unmaneuverable wreck. In total, &quot;Hiei&quot; had been struck by at least 85 American 8”, 6”, and 5” shells as well as hundreds of smaller caliber shells. &quot;Hiei&quot; was also struck by nine torpedoes from the US destroyers &quot;Cushing&quot;, &quot;O’Bannon&quot;, &quot;Monssen&quot;, and &quot;Sterett&quot; (though most, if not all probably failed to explode). Naval historian Robert Lundgren in his 2023 book on the battle claims six of these torpedoes exploded, but this is highly doubtful given the fact that &quot;Hiei&#x27;s&quot; sistership &quot;Kongō&quot; was sunk by only 2-3 less powerful torpedoes fired by the submarine USS Sealion.

With one of his battleships crippled, Abe ordered the remainder of the Japanese fleet to withdraw at 02:00. &quot;Kirishima&quot; attempted to tow &quot;Hiei&quot; to safety, but water flooded &quot;Hiei&quot;″s steering compartments, jamming her rudder to starboard and forcing her to steer in circles. Throughout the morning of 13 November, &quot;Hiei&quot; was subjected to attack from American Army B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. She continued circling to starboard at . At 11:30, three torpedoes launched from Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers struck &quot;Hiei&quot;., and after landing and rearming at Henderson field, the torpedo planes from the USS Enterprise hit the battleship with three more torpedoes. The combined attacks by both the B-17s and strike aircraft from Henderson Field inflicted a total of 5-8 torpedo hits and 7-8 500 lb and 1000 lb bomb hits on the stricken battleship in addition to the damage from the night surface battle. Her crew was ordered to abandon ship, and her escorting destroyers scuttled her with torpedoes. &quot;Hiei&quot; sank sometime in the evening on 13 November with the loss of 188 of her crew; the first battleship lost by Japan during World War II. She was removed from the Navy List on 20 December 1942.

===Wreck===
On 6 February 2019, Paul Allen&#x27;s exploration ship announced the discovery of &quot;Hiei&quot;. According to &quot;Petrel&quot;, the main body of &quot;Hiei&quot; now lies upside down in of water northwest of Savo Island in the Solomon Islands. As with her sister ship, &quot;Kirishima&quot;, the bow of the ship is gone forward of the bridge due to a magazine explosion.

<doc id="521235" wikidata="Q1641747" url="?curid=521235" title="Japanese battleship Hyūga">
<text>was the second and last built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1910s. Although completed in 1918, she played no role in World War I. &quot;Hyūga&quot; supported Japanese forces in the early 1920s during the Siberian intervention in the Russian Civil War. In 1923, she assisted survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake. The ship was partially modernised in two stages in 1927–1928 and 1931–1932, during which her forward superstructure was rebuilt in the pagoda mast style. &quot;Hyūga&quot; was reconstructed in 1934–1936, improvements being made to her armour and propulsion machinery. Afterwards, she played a minor role in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Despite the expensive reconstruction, the ship was considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War, and did not see significant action in the early years of the war. After the loss of most of the IJN&#x27;s large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid-1942, she was rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give her the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes; lack of aircraft and qualified pilots meant that &quot;Hyūga&quot; never operated her aircraft in combat. She participated in the Battle off Cape Engaño in late 1944, where she helped to decoy the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches. Afterwards, the ship was transferred to Southeast Asia, occasionally serving as a flagship. In early 1945, &quot;Hyūga&quot; participated in Operation Kita, during which she transported petrol and other strategic materials back to Japan. The ship was then reduced to reserve until she was sunk during American airstrikes in July. After the war, &quot;Hyūga&quot; was scrapped in 1946–1947.

==Design and description==

The &quot;Ise&quot; class was designed as an improved version of the preceding . The ships had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They displaced at standard load and at deep load, roughly more than the earlier ships. Their crew consisted of 1,360 officers and ratings.

During the ships&#x27; modernisation in the 1930s, their forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod masts to create a pagoda mast. Both ships were also given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the extra armour. These changes increased their overall length to , their beam to and their draught to . Their displacement increased over to at deep load. The crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Ise&quot;-class ships had two sets of direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 24 Kampon Ro Gō water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of and give the ships a speed of . &quot;Hyūga&quot; reached from during her sea trials. Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil, and the ships carried enough of both to give them a range of at a speed of .

During their 1930s modernisation, the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new Kampon oil-fired boilers. The turbines were replaced by four geared Kampon turbines with a designed output of intended to increase their speed to . The fuel storage of the ships was increased which gave them a range of at , despite the additional weight.

===Armament===

The twelve Type 41 guns of the &quot;Ise&quot; class were mounted in three pairs of twin-gun, superfiring turrets that were numbered one through six from front to rear. The first pair was forward of the main superstructure, the second pair was amidships, and the last ones were aft of the rear superstructure. The ships&#x27; secondary armament consisted of twenty Type3 guns in single mounts. Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by four 40-calibre 3rd Year Type 8-centimetre (3 in) anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with six submerged torpedo tubes, three on each broadside.

In 1931–1933 the AA guns were replaced with eight Type 89 dual-purpose guns, placed beside the forward superstructure in four twin-gun mounts. Two twin-gun mounts for license-built Vickers two-pounder () light AA guns were also added while the pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed.

During the mid-1930s reconstruction, the torpedo tubes were removed, and the Vickers two-pounders were replaced by twenty license-built Hotchkiss Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin-gun mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to naval historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;. During the reconstruction, the forward pair of 14-centimetre guns in the forecastle were removed.

===Protection===
The &quot;Ise&quot;-class ships&#x27; waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of of Vickers cemented armour amidships; below it was a strake of armour. The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel totalling thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel, but only thick in total. The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of on the face and 76 mm on the roof. The casemate armour was thick and that of the barbettes was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Hyūga&quot;, named after Hyūga Province, one of the traditional provinces of Japan, was laid down at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipyard in Nagasaki on 6May 1915 and launched on 27 January 1917. Captain Shigeushi Nakagawa assumed command on 30 April and the ship was completed on that same day, too late for service in World War I. &quot;Hyūga&quot; was then assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. Captain Kinzaburo Mimura relieved Nakegawa on 10 November. An explosion in No.3 gun turret killed 11 crewmen and wounded another 25 during a gunnery exercise on 24 October 1919. Mimura was relieved in his turn by Captain Genjiro Katsuki on 20 November. &quot;Hyūga&quot; accidentally collided with and sank the schooner &quot;Hiromiya Maru&quot;, killing two of the sailing ship&#x27;s crew, on 21 July 1920. On 29 August, the ship began the first of numerous patrols off the Siberian coast and in northern waters in support of Japan&#x27;s Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. Captain Hidesaburo Ishikawa replaced Katsuki on 20 November and he was replaced by Captain Genji Ide on 20 November 1921.

The ship aided survivors of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake in September 1923. From the early 1920s through the late 1930s, &quot;Hyūga&quot; often cruised off the coast of China. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s. The ship was in 1927–1928, during which her forward superstructure was enlarged and her aviation facilities improved. Beginning on 27 March 1932, she patrolled off the coast of China after the First Shanghai Incident, together with her sister ship and the battlecruisers and . On 14 June 1932, she was taking part in an exercise off Kyushu near the Mishima Islands in which a group of submarines practiced a mock combined attack on the 1st Battleship Division when the submarine unexpectedly surfaced in front of her. &quot;Hyūga&quot;, zigzagging at , took evasive action at the last minute and managed to avoid a direct collision with the stationary &quot;I-4&quot;, although &quot;Hyūga&quot; suffered minor damage to her hull plating when her bow grazed &quot;I-4&quot;′s hull.
Beginning on 24 October 1934, &quot;Hyūga&quot; was drydocked at Kure Naval Arsenal and underwent an extensive reconstruction and modernisation that lasted until 7September 1936. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ship ferried two battalions of the 3rd Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force to Port Arthur, China, on 19 August 1937. She began the first of her patrols off the southern Chinese coast on 15 September that lasted until early 1941. On 30 June 1940 &quot;Hyūga&quot; served as the flagship for the Emperor of Manchukuo, Henry Pu Yi, during his state visit to Japan. Together with &quot;Ise&quot;, the ship was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet on 15 November. Captain Noboru Ishizaki assumed command on 1September 1941.

===Start of the Pacific War===
When full-scale war started for Japan on 8 December, the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the light carrier , sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. Captain Chiaki Matsuda relieved Ishizaki on 20 February 1942. Together with the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division, &quot;Hyūga&quot; pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April.

In May 1942 while conducting gunnery practice along with &quot;Nagato&quot; and &quot;Mutsu&quot;, the breech of &quot;Hyūga&quot;″s left-hand gun in her No.5 turret exploded, killing 51 crewmen. The two aft magazines were rapidly flooded to save the ship and she returned to Kure for repairs. The turret was deemed not to be repairable and was removed. A circular plate of armour was welded over the barbette and three triple mounts for 2.5 cm AA guns were installed there. While under repair, the ship was fitted with one of the first experimental Type 22 surface-search radar sets in the IJN, but it was removed shortly afterwards.

&quot;Hyūga&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division set sail on 28 May with the Aleutian Support Group at the same time most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI). Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division was composed of Japan&#x27;s four oldest battleships, including &quot;Hyūga&quot;, accompanied by two light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and two oilers. Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation, known as Operation AL; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed.

===Conversion to a hybrid carrier===

The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June severely limited the ability of the IJN to conduct operations and alternatives were sought. Plans for full conversions of battleships into aircraft carriers were rejected on the grounds of expense and, most critically, time, so the IJN settled on removing the rear pair of turrets from the &quot;Ise&quot;-class ships and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two rotating catapults. Matsuda was relieved by Captain Sueo Obayashi on 10 December and he was relieved in turn on 1May 1943, the same day that the conversion officially began. Work actually began two months later. The ship&#x27;s No.6 turret and the barbettes for No.5 and6 turrets were replaced by a hangar surmounted by a flight deck. This was not long enough to permit the launch of aircraft or their recovery. Two catapults were installed and the existing crane was moved to the flight deck. This was fitted with an extensive system of rails to link each catapult, the storage positions on the deck and the T-shaped aircraft lift that moved aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. It had a capacity of nine aircraft, with eleven more stowed on deck, and one on each catapult for a total of twenty-two. The ship&#x27;s air group was intended to consist of a dozen each Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot; dive bombers (Allied reporting name &quot;Judy&quot;), modified for catapult launching, and Aichi E16A reconnaissance floatplanes (Allied reporting name &quot;Paul&quot;), of which two to three of each were reserves. The former had to land either on a conventional carrier or on land bases, whereas the E16A could be hoisted back aboard using a crane, after landing on the water near the ship.

During the conversion, all of the 14 cm guns were removed and the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft suite was heavily reinforced. The eight 12.7 cm Type 89 guns were supplemented with four twin mounts and the existing 2.5 cm Type 96 AA twin-gun mounts were replaced by 19 triple-gun mounts for a total of 57 weapons.

These changes increased the ship&#x27;s overall length to and the removal of the heavy gun turrets and their barbettes reduced her displacement to at deep load, despite the addition of more fuel oil storage. The extra fuel increased &quot;Hyūga&quot;″s range to . The weight reductions decreased her draught to . The crew now numbered 1,463 officers and enlisted men.

The rebuild was officially completed on 18 November and Captain Tomekichi Nomura assumed command on 5December as the ship was working up. &quot;Hyūga&quot; served as a training ship for most of the first half of 1944. On 25 February, Battleship Division2 was assigned to the direct control of the Combined Fleet. The sisters were then transferred to the Third Fleet and assigned to the newly reformed Fourth Carrier Division on 1May. That same day the 634th Naval Air Group was formed and assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division. On 24 May, the ship&#x27;s light anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 24 additional Type 96 AA guns in eight triple mounts, which brought her total to 104 guns. On 7June, a pair of improved Type 22 surface-search radars were installed. A pair of Type 13 early-warning radars and an E27 radar detector were probably also fitted.

On 23 June, the sisters conducted their first catapult training, each with four D4Ys and six E16As aboard; subsequent sessions were conducted on 21 July and 31 August. Two days later, &quot;Hyūga&quot; became the flagship of the Fourth Carrier Division, now commanded by the recently promoted Rear Admiral Matsuda. In September, six racks of 30-tube 12.7 cm anti-aircraft rocket launchers were added. Training of the D4Y and E16A aircrew was slowed by technical problems and was generally conducted from land bases. By 1October the 634th had on strength 17 D4Ys, of which six were serviceable, and 18 E16As, of which 16 were operable.

===Battle off Cape Engaño and afterwards===
After the Americans began attacking Japanese installations in the Bonin Islands on 10 October 1944, the aircraft of the Fourth Carrier Division were ordered to prepare for combat by the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda. Two days later, the 634th Naval Air Group was reassigned to the Second Air Fleet and began flying to bases in southern Kyushu; among these were nine D4Ys and a dozen E16As assigned to &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot;. On 14 October they attacked the aircraft carriers of Task Force 38 near Formosa with little effect and heavy losses. The following day Nomura was promoted to rear admiral.

The ships of the Fourth Carrier Division were assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa. The Main Body&#x27;s role was to act as decoys to attract attention away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west. All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Ozawa ordered an air strike launched by the Third Carrier Division (&quot;Hyūga&quot; and &quot;Ise&quot; had no aircraft aboard) to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They finally found them, but Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day.

On the morning of 25 October, &quot;Hyūga&quot; was positioned near the light carriers and to protect them with her anti-aircraft guns. Her radar picked up the first of five American airstrikes at a range of at 07:13, but the battleship was not a primary target. Fragments from near misses by bombs damaged the ship&#x27;s anti-torpedo blister and she developed a 5° list that was easily corrected. Despite &quot;Hyūga&quot;″s protection, &quot;Chiyoda&quot; was set afire and her engines were disabled. Matsuda ordered the battleship and the light cruiser to tow the crippled carrier, but &quot;Hyūga&quot; was unable to do so and rejoined the main body at 18:30. The American submarine spotted the Fourth Carrier Division at 17:42 and manoeuvered to attack, missing with six torpedoes at 18:43. At 19:00 Ozawa ordered Matsuda to take his ships south to defend &quot;Isuzu&quot; and her escorting destroyers that were attempting to rescue &quot;Chiyoda&quot;″s survivors, despite gunfire from a group of four American cruisers. Unable to locate either group of ships, Ozawa ordered Matsuda to reverse course at 23:30 and head for Amami Ōshima to refuel. Despite being spotted by American submarines en route, the division arrived safely on 27 October. That same day Ozawa transferred his flag to &quot;Hyūga&quot;. After leaving the island the following day, they were unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before their arrival at Kure on the 29th.

Between 29 October and 8 November, the catapults were removed to improve the firing arcs of No.3 and No.4 turrets. &quot;Hyūga&quot; and &quot;Ise&quot; departed on 11 November, loaded with troops and munitions for Manila, capital of the Philippines, but news was received of heavy American air attacks on Manila and they were diverted to the Spratly Islands. They arrived on 14 November and their cargo was unloaded so it could be transshipped to the Philippines. The 4th Carrier Division was transferred to the 2nd Fleet the following day. Reinforced by the battleship and three cruisers, the sisters proceeded on to Lingga Island, near Singapore, on 20 November. They arrived two days later and remained there until 12 December when they departed for Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, where they were on standby for an attack on an American supply convoy bound for the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima, commander of the 5th Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Hyūga&quot; two days later. The attack was cancelled on the 30th and the ships sailed for Singapore where they arrived on 1January 1945 before continuing on to Lingga. That same day the Fourth Carrier Division was transferred to the Southwest Area Fleet and Shima hauled his flag down. On 6February, the division sailed for Singapore to participate in Operation Kita. The sisters and the light cruiser were loaded with critically needed strategic war supplies (oil, rubber, tin, zinc, and mercury) and 1,150 surplus oil workers to be ferried back to Japan.

===Final role===
The division sailed from Singapore on 10 February 1945 and was spotted by the British submarine the following day. &quot;Tantalus&quot; was forced to submerge by a maritime patrol aircraft and was unable to attack. On 13 February the submarine unsuccessfully attacked the ships as did the submarine . Later that afternoon, &quot;Ōyodo&quot; launched one of her floatplanes which spotted the submarine on the surface about ahead of the convoy. &quot;Hyūga&quot; opened fire with her main guns and forced &quot;Bashaw&quot; to submerge when one of her shells landed within of the submarine. The convoy reached the Matsu Islands, off the Chinese coast, on the 15th and was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before they reached Zhoushan Island, near Shanghai, that night. The convoy reached Kure on 20 February, having evaded or escaped pursuit by twenty-three Allied submarines along the way.
The 4th Carrier Division was disbanded on 1March and &quot;Hyūga&quot; was reduced to first-class reserve. Rear Admiral Kiyoshi Kusakawa relieved Nomura that same day. From this time until the surrender of Japan, &quot;Hyūga&quot; was anchored in Hiroshima Bay without fuel or aircraft. More than 240 American carrier-based aircraft from Task Force 58 attacked Kure on 19 March and the ship was hit by three bombs, killing 37 and wounding 52 crewmen. Her anti-aircraft guns claimed to have shot down a single Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bomber during the attack. Re-designated as a fourth-class reserve ship on 20 April, &quot;Hyūga&quot; was towed to a new position within Hiroshima Bay and heavily camouflaged. She was later attacked during the bombing of Kure on 24 July and was struck by 10 bombs that blew off part of her stem, destroyed her bridge and started major fires. Over 200 sailors were killed, including Kusakawa, and 600 wounded by the attack. Progressive flooding caused the ship to sink in shallow water over the next several days and her crew was ordered to remove all easily accessible weapons. &quot;Hyūga&quot; was unsuccessfully attacked by 24 USAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers on the 29th and abandoned three days later by her crew. She was removed from the Navy List on 20 November 1945. Her wreck was raised and broken up by the Kure Dockyard of the Harima Zōsen Corporation from 2July 1946 to 4July 1947.

<text>Mark Reed Crispin (July 19, 1956 in Camden, New Jersey – December 28, 2012 in Poulsbo, Washington) is best known as the father of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), having invented it in 1985 during his time at the Stanford Knowledge Systems Laboratory. He is the author or co-author of numerous RFCs and was the principal author of UW IMAP, one of the reference implementations of the IMAP4rev1 protocol described in RFC 3501. He also designed the MIX mail storage format.

Crispin earned a B.S. in Technology and Society from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1977.

==Career==
From 1977 to 1988, he was a Systems Programmer at Stanford University. He developed the first production PDP-10 96-bit leader ARPANET Network Control Program (NCP) for the WAITS operating system, and wrote or rewrote most of the WAITS ARPAnet protocol suite. Prior to that time most systems only supported the original 32-bit leader. During that time, he wrote the infamous RFC 748, the only document specifically marked in the RFC index with &quot;note date of issue&quot;; and a series of Telnet implementations for the Incompatible Timesharing System, WAITS, and TOPS-20 operating systems whose escape behavior was playfully immortalized by Guy Steele in the April 1984 Communications of the ACM as &quot;The Telnet Song&quot;.

In the early 1980s, shortly after becoming the Systems Programmer for the Stanford Computer Science Department&#x27;s TOPS-20 system, he became interested in electronic mail software and systems; thereafter this became his primary focus. He became the principal developer of the TOPS-20 mailsystem, and reportedly was still running TOPS-20 systems at his residence in 2009. It was at Stanford, in the 1985–88 period, that IMAP was first developed.

From 1988 to 2008, he was a Software Engineer at the University of Washington, where much of the work in developing and popularizing IMAP and building what became UW IMAP was done. He forked UW IMAP into Panda IMAP in May 2008.

While working at UW, Mark was one of the creators of the simple and portable Unix email program Pine, launched in March 1992.

In 2005, he wrote RFC 4042, his second April Fools&#x27; Day RFC describing UTF-9 and UTF-18, encodings of Unicode optimized for the PDP-10.

In August 2008, Crispin joined Messaging Architects as a Senior Software Engineer. At Messaging Architects, he wrote an entirely new IMAP server based upon a distributed mail store, and extended the MIX format to support stubbing (via a mechanism called virtual mailboxes) and metadata.

==Death==

On 19 November 2012, it was announced that Crispin was terminally ill and in hospice care, and he died on December 28, 2012.

In April 2013, Crispin was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award in Science and Technology by his alma mater, Stevens Institute of Technology.

<doc id="521241" wikidata="Q183424" url="?curid=521241" title="Persona non grata">
<text>In diplomacy, a &#x27; (PNG)[[Persona non grata| (&#x27;) is a foreign [[diplomat]] who is asked by the host country to be recalled to their home country. If the person is not recalled as requested, the host state may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the diplomatic mission (including the removal of [[diplomatic immunity]]). A host country may declare &quot;&quot; status for any member of a diplomatic staff at any time without any explanation.

==Diplomacy==
Under Article 9 of the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], a receiving state may &quot;at any time and without having to explain its decision&quot; declare any member of a diplomatic staff &quot;&quot;. A person so declared is considered unacceptable and is usually recalled to their home nation. If not recalled, the receiving state &quot;may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the mission&quot;. A person can be declared before that person even enters the country.

With the protection of mission staff from prosecution for violating civil and [[criminal law]]s, depending on rank, under Articles 41 and 42 of the Vienna Convention, they are bound to respect national laws and regulations. Breaches of these articles can lead to a declaration being used to punish erring staff. It is also used to expel diplomats suspected of [[espionage]], described as &quot;activities incompatible with diplomatic status&quot;, or any overt criminal act such as [[drug trafficking]]. The declaration may also be a symbolic indication of displeasure.

So-called &quot;[[tit for tat]]&quot; exchanges have occurred (whereby countries involved in a dispute each expel the ambassador or other diplomats of the other country), notably during the [[Cold War]]. A notable occurrence outside of the Cold War was an exchange between the [[United States]] and [[Ecuador]] in 2011; the Ecuadorian government expelled the United States ambassador, as a result of the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], and the United States responded by expelling the Ecuadorian ambassador.
==Other usage==

People other than diplomats can be declared &quot;&quot; by a country.

In non-diplomatic usage, referring to someone as &quot;&quot; is to say that the person is not popular or accepted by others.

In the Philippines, local legislatures of provinces, towns, and cities can declare certain people or groups, including non-diplomats and Filipino citizens, as &quot;[[Persona non grata (Philippines)|persona non grata]]&quot; to express a negative sentiment toward the certain person through a [[non-binding resolution]]. This could be in response to the person breaking local ordinance or laws. This has also happened in Spain.

<doc id="521248" wikidata="Q1048194" url="?curid=521248" title="Tropical forest">
<text>Tropical forests are forested ecoregions with tropical climates – that is, land areas approximately bounded by the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, but possibly affected by other factors such as prevailing winds.
Some tropical forest types are difficult to categorize. While forests in temperate areas are readily categorized on the basis of tree canopy density, such schemes do not work well in tropical forests. There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is, in tropical regions or elsewhere. Because of these difficulties, information on the extent of tropical forests varies between sources. However, tropical forests are extensive, making up just under half the world&#x27;s forests. The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the world&#x27;s forests (45 percent), followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.

More than 3.6 million hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2018.

==History==
The first tropical rainforests appeared during the Devonian, characterized mainly by Pseudosporochnalean and Archaeopteridalean plants. Other canopy forests expanded north-south of the equator during the Paleogene epoch, around 40 million years ago, as a result of the emergence of drier, cooler climates.

The tropical forest was originally identified as a specific type of biome in 1949. 

==Types of tropical forest==
Tropical forests are often thought of as evergreen rainforests and moist forests, but these account for only a portion of them (depending on how they are defined – see maps). The remaining tropical forests are a diversity of many different forest types including:
&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; open forest, tropical coniferous forests, savanna woodland (&quot;e.g.&quot; Sahelian forest), and mountain forests (the higher elevations of which are cloud forests). Over even relatively short distances, the boundaries between these biomes may be unclear, with ecotones between the main types.

The nature of tropical forests in any given area is affected by several factors, most importantly:
* Geographical: location and climatic zone (see sub-types), with:
**Temperature profile, which is relatively even in equatorial rainforest or with a cooler season towards subtropical latitudes;
**Precipitation levels and seasonality, with strong dry seasons significantly affecting flora (&quot;e.g.&quot; the predominance of lianas);
**Elevation affects the above, often creating &quot;ecological islands&quot; with high endemism (&quot;e.g.&quot; Mount Kinabalu in the Borneo rainforest).
* Historical: prehistoric age of forest and level of recent disturbance (see threats), changing primary (usually maximum biodiversity) into secondary forest, degenerating into bamboo forest after prolonged swidden agriculture (&quot;e.g.&quot; in several areas of Indo-China).
* Soil characteristics (also subject to various classifications): including depth and drainage.

===The &quot;Global 200&quot; scheme===
The &quot;Global 200&quot; scheme, promoted by the World Wildlife Fund, classifies three main tropical forest habitat types (biomes), grouping together tropical and sub-tropical areas (maps below):
* Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests.
* Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests,
* Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests,

Extent of tropical and sub-tropical -
==Threats==
A number of tropical forests have been designated High-Biodiversity Wilderness Areas, but remain subject to a wide range of disturbances, including more localized pressures such as habitat loss and degradation and anthropogenic climate change. 

Studies have also shown that ongoing climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of some climate extremes (e.g. droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes) which, in combination with other local human disturbances, are driving unprecedented negative ecological consequences for tropical forests around the world. All tropical forests have experienced at least some levels of disturbance. 

Current deforestation in the biodiversity hotspots of North of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and the Pacific, can be attributed to export of commodities such as: beef, soy, coffee, cacao, palm oil, and timber; there is a requirement for &quot;strong transnational efforts ... by improving supply chain transparency [and] public–private engagement&quot;.

A study in Borneo describes how, between 1973 and 2018, the old-growth forest had been reduced from 76% to 50% of the island, mostly due to fire and agricultural expansion. A widely-held view is that placing a value on the ecosystem services these forests provide may bring about more sustainable policies. However, clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for environmental, social and economic outcomes are needed. 

For example, a study in Vietnam indicated that poor and inconsistent data combined with a lack of human resources and political interest (thus lack of financial support) are hampering efforts to improve forest land allocation and a Payments for Forest Environmental Services scheme.

<text>Harold Lloyd Hopkins (August 17, 1890 – January 29, 1946) was an American statesman, public administrator, and presidential advisor. A trusted deputy to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Hopkins directed New Deal relief programs before serving as the eighth United States secretary of commerce from 1938 to 1940 and as Roosevelt&#x27;s chief foreign policy advisor and liaison to Allied leaders during World War II. During his career, Hopkins supervised the New York Temporary Emergency Relief Administration, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civil Works Administration, and the Works Progress Administration, which he built into the largest employer in the United States. He later oversaw the $50 billion Lend-Lease program of military aid to the Allies and, as Roosevelt&#x27;s personal envoy, played a pivotal role in shaping the alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom.

Born in Iowa, Hopkins settled in New York City after he graduated from Grinnell College. He accepted a position in New York City&#x27;s Bureau of Child Welfare and worked for various social work and public health organizations. He was elected president of the National Association of Social Workers in 1923. In 1931, New York Temporary Emergency Relief Administration chairman Jesse I. Straus hired Hopkins as the agency&#x27;s executive director. His successful leadership of the program earned the attention of then-New York Governor Roosevelt, who brought Hopkins into his federal administration after he won the 1932 presidential election. Hopkins enjoyed close relationships with President Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and was considered a potential successor to the president until the late 1930s, when his health began to decline due to a long-running battle with stomach cancer.

As Roosevelt&#x27;s closest confidant, Hopkins assumed a leading foreign policy role after the outset of World War II. From 1940 until 1943, Hopkins lived in the White House and assisted the president in the management of American foreign policy, particularly toward the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. He traveled frequently to the United Kingdom, whose prime minister, Winston Churchill, recalled Hopkins in his memoirs as a &quot;natural leader of men&quot; with &quot;a flaming soul.&quot; Hopkins attended the major conferences of the Allied powers, including the Casablanca Conference (January 1943), the Cairo Conference (November 1943), the Tehran Conference (November–December 1943), and the Yalta Conference (February 1945). His health continued to decline, and he died in 1946 at the age of 55.

==Early life==
Hopkins was born at 512 Tenth Street in Sioux City, Iowa, the fourth child of four sons and one daughter of David Aldona and Anna (&quot;née&quot; Pickett) Hopkins. His father, born in Bangor, Maine, ran a harness shop (after an erratic career as a salesman, prospector, storekeeper, and bowling-alley operator), but his real passion was bowling, and he eventually returned to it as a business. Anna Hopkins, born in Hamilton, Ontario, had moved at an early age to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she married David. She was deeply religious and active in the affairs of the Methodist church. Shortly after Harry was born, the family moved successively to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Kearney and Hastings, Nebraska. They spent two years in Chicago and finally settled in Grinnell, Iowa.

Hopkins attended Grinnell College and soon after his graduation in 1912 took a job with Christodora House, a social settlement house in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side ghetto. In the spring of 1913, he accepted a position from John A. Kingsbury of the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (AICP) as a &quot;friendly visitor&quot; and superintendent of the Employment Bureau within the AICP&#x27;s Department of Family Welfare. During the 1915 recession, Hopkins and the AICP&#x27;s William Matthews, with $5,000 from Elizabeth Milbank Anderson&#x27;s Milbank Memorial Fund, organized the Bronx Park Employment program, which was one of the first public employment programs in the US.

==Social and public health work==
In 1915, New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel appointed Hopkins executive secretary of the Bureau of Child Welfare which administered pensions to mothers with dependent children.

Hopkins at first opposed America&#x27;s entrance into World War I, but, when war was declared in 1917, he supported it enthusiastically. He was rejected for the draft because of a bad eye. Hopkins moved to New Orleans where he worked for the American Red Cross as director of Civilian Relief, Gulf Division. Eventually, the Gulf Division of the Red Cross merged with the Southwestern Division and Hopkins, headquartered now in Atlanta, was appointed general manager in 1921. Hopkins helped draft a charter for the American Association of Social Workers (AASW) and was elected its president in 1923.

In 1922, Hopkins returned to New York City, where the AICP was involved with the Milbank Memorial Fund and the State Charities Aid Association in running three health demonstrations in New York State. Hopkins became manager of the Bellevue-Yorkville health project and assistant director of the AICP. In mid-1924 he became executive director of the New York Tuberculosis Association. During his tenure, the agency grew enormously and absorbed the New York Heart Association.

In 1931, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt named R. H. Macy&#x27;s department store president Jesse Straus as president of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA). Straus named Hopkins, then unknown to Roosevelt, as TERA&#x27;s executive director. His efficient administration of the initial $20 million outlay to the agency gained Roosevelt&#x27;s attention, and in 1932, he promoted Hopkins to the presidency of the agency. Hopkins and Eleanor Roosevelt began a long friendship, which strengthened his role in relief programs.

==New Deal==
In March 1933, Roosevelt summoned Hopkins to Washington as federal relief administrator. Convinced that paid work was psychologically more valuable than cash handouts, Hopkins sought to continue and expand New York State&#x27;s work relief programs, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration. He supervised the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Over 90% of the people employed by the Hopkins programs were unemployed or on relief. He feuded with Harold Ickes, who ran a rival program, the Public Works Administration, which also created jobs by contracting private construction firms, which did not require applicants to be unemployed or on relief.
FERA, the largest program from 1933 to 1935, involved giving money to localities to operate work relief projects to employ those on direct relief. CWA was similar but did not require workers to be on relief to receive a government-sponsored job. In less than four months, the CWA hired four million people, and during its five months of operation, the CWA built and repaired 200 swimming pools, 3,700 playgrounds, 40,000 schools, of road, and 12 million feet of sewer pipe.

The WPA, which followed the CWA, employed 8.5 million people in its seven-year history, working on 1.4 million projects, including the building or repair of 103 golf courses, 1,000 airports, 2,500 hospitals, 2,500 sports stadiums, 3,900 schools, 8,192 parks, 12,800 playgrounds, 124,031 bridges, 125,110 public buildings, and of highways and roads. The WPA operated on its own on selected projects in co-operation with local and state governments, but always with its own staff and budget. Hopkins started programs for youth (National Youth Administration) and for artists and writers (Federal One Programs). Hopkins and Eleanor Roosevelt worked together to publicize and defend New Deal relief programs. He was concerned with rural areas but increasingly focused on cities in the Great Depression.

In the years after he resigned, Hopkins expressed pride in the WPA&#x27;s key role in building internment camps for Japanese Americans. On March 19, 1942, for example, he lauded Howard O. Hunter, the head of the WPA at that time, for the &quot;building of those camps for War Department for the Japanese evacuees on the West Coast.&quot;

Before Hopkins began to decline from his struggle with stomach cancer in the late 1930s, Roosevelt appeared to be training him as a possible successor. With the advent of World War II in Europe, however, Roosevelt ran again in 1940 and won an unprecedented third term.

==World War II==

On May 10, 1940, after a long night and day spent discussing the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg that had ended the so-called &quot;Phoney War,&quot; Roosevelt urged a tired Hopkins to stay for dinner and then the night in a second-floor White House bedroom. Hopkins would live out of the bedroom for the next three-and-a-half years.
On December 7, 1941, at 1:40 pm, Hopkins was in the Oval Study, in the White House, having lunch with President Roosevelt, when Roosevelt received the first report that Pearl Harbor had been attacked via phone from Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. Initially, Hopkins was skeptical of the news until Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Harold Rainsford Stark called a few minutes later to confirm Pearl Harbor had in fact been attacked.

During the war years, Hopkins acted as Roosevelt&#x27;s chief emissary to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In January 1941, Roosevelt dispatched Hopkins to assess Britain&#x27;s determination and situation. Churchill escorted the important visitor all over the United Kingdom. Before he returned, at a small dinner party in the North British Hotel, Glasgow, Hopkins rose to propose a toast: &quot;I suppose you wish to know what I am going to say to President Roosevelt on my return. Well I am going to quote to you one verse from the Book of Ruth ... &#x27;Whither thou goest, I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge, thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.&#x27;&quot; Hopkins became the administrator of the Lend-Lease program, under which the United States gave to Britain and Soviet Union, China, and other Allied nations food, oil, and materiel including warships, warplanes and weaponry. Repayment was primarily in the form of Allied military action against the enemy, as well as leases on army and naval bases in Allied territory used by American forces.

Hopkins had a major voice in policy for the vast $50 billion Lend-Lease program, especially regarding supplies, first for Britain and then, upon the German invasion, the Soviets. He went to Moscow in July 1941 to make personal contact with Joseph Stalin. Hopkins recommended and Roosevelt accepted the inclusion of the Soviets in Lend Lease. Hopkins made Lend Lease decisions in terms of Roosevelt&#x27;s broad foreign policy goals. He accompanied Churchill to the Atlantic Conference. Hopkins promoted an aggressive war against Germany and successfully urged Roosevelt to use the Navy to protect convoys headed for Britain before the US had entered the war in December 1941. Roosevelt brought him along as advisor to his meetings with Churchill and Stalin at Cairo, Tehran, Casablanca in 1942–43, and Yalta in 1945.

He was a firm supporter of China, which received Lend-Lease aid for its military and air force. Hopkins wielded more diplomatic power than the entire State Department. Hopkins helped identify and sponsor numerous potential leaders, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. He continued to live in the White House and saw the President more often than any other advisor.
In mid-1943, Hopkins faced a barrage of criticism from Republicans and the press that he had abused his position for personal profit. One Representative asserted that British media tycoon Lord Beaverbrook had given Hopkins&#x27;s wife, Louise, $500,000 worth of emeralds, which Louise denied. Newspapers ran stories detailing sumptuous dinners that Hopkins attended while he was making public calls for sacrifice. Hopkins briefly considered suing the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; for libel after a story that compared him to Grigory Rasputin, the famous courtier of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, but he was dissuaded by Roosevelt.

Although Hopkins&#x27;s health was steadily declining, Roosevelt sent him on additional trips to Europe in 1945. Hopkins attended the Yalta Conference in February 1945. He tried to resign after Roosevelt died, but President Harry S. Truman sent Hopkins on one more mission to Moscow. Hopkins met with Stalin in late May to secure reassurances on Soviet involvement in the Pacific theater and to arrange concessions on the Soviet sphere of influence in postwar Poland.

Hopkins had three sons who served in the armed forces during the war: Robert, David and Stephen. Stephen was killed in action while he was serving in the Marine Corps.

==Relations with Soviet Union==

Hopkins was the top American official assigned to dealing with Soviet officials during World War II. He liaised with Soviet officials from the middle ranks to the very highest, including Stalin. Anastas Mikoyan was Hopkins&#x27; counterpart with responsibility for Lend-Lease. He often explained Roosevelt&#x27;s plans to Stalin and other top Soviet officials to enlist Soviet support for American objectives, an endeavor that met with limited success. A particularly striking example of bad faith was Moscow&#x27;s refusal to allow American naval experts to see the German experimental U-boat station at Gdynia captured on March 28, 1945, and thus to help the protection of the very convoys that carried Lend-Lease aid. In turn, Hopkins passed on Stalin&#x27;s stated goals and needs to Roosevelt. As the top American decision maker in Lend-Lease, he gave priority to supplying the Soviet Union, despite repeated objections from Republicans. As Soviet soldiers were bearing the brunt of the war, Hopkins felt that American aid to the Soviets would hasten the war&#x27;s conclusion.

On August 10, 1943, he spoke about the USSR&#x27;s decisive role in the war, saying that &quot;Without Russia in the war, the Axis cannot be defeated in Europe, and the position of the United Nations becomes precarious. Similarly, Russia&#x27;s post-war position in Europe will be a dominant one. With Germany crushed, there is no power in Europe to oppose her tremendous military forces.&quot;

Hopkins continued to be a target of attacks even after his death. George Racey Jordan testified to the House Un-American Activities Committee in December 1949 that Hopkins passed nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Historians do not cite Jordan as credible since at the time Jordan claimed to have met with Hopkins in Washington regarding uranium shipments, Hopkins was in intensive care at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. In 1963, the FBI concluded that Jordan &quot;either lied for publicity and profit or was delusional.&quot; According to historian Sean McMeekin, in his recent book &quot;Stalin’s War&quot; (2021), “Many US lend-lease records, including the correspondence of Hopkins and Edward Stettinius Jr and the minutes of the Soviet protocol committee, were declassified in the 1970s, long after opinions about Soviet espionage had hardened into dogma. These files are now open, and they confirm the veracity of nearly all of Jordan’s claims, except for his allegation that Hopkins’s actions were illegal”.

It is likely that any Soviets who spoke to Hopkins would have been routinely required to report the contact to the NKVD, the Soviet national security agency. Eduard Mark (1998) says that some Soviets, such as spymaster Iskhak Akhmerov, thought that Hopkins was pro-Soviet, but others thought that he was not. Verne W. Newton, the author of &quot;FDR and the Holocaust&quot;, said that no writer discussing Hopkins has identified any secrets disclosed or any decision in which he distorted American priorities to help communism. As Mark demonstrated, Hopkins was not pro-Soviet in his recommendations to Roosevelt; he was anti-German and pro-American. Any &quot;secrets&quot; disclosed were authorized. Mark says that at the time, any actions were taken specifically to help the American war effort and to prevent the Soviets from making a deal with Hitler.

It is currently considered likely that Laurence Duggan was the titular agent &quot;19&quot; mentioned in the Venona Project decryptions of Soviet cables. Hopkins may simply have been naïve in his estimation of Soviet intentions. The historian Robert Conquest wrote that &quot;Hopkins seems just to have accepted an absurdly fallacious stereotype of Soviet motivation, without making any attempt whatever to think, or to study the readily available evidence, or to seek the judgement of the knowledgeable. He conducted policy vis-a-vis Stalin with mere dogmatic confidence in his own (and his circle&#x27;s) unshakeable sentiments.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1913, Hopkins married Ethel Gross (1886–1976), a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant active in New York City&#x27;s Progressive movement. They had three sons: David, Robert, and Stephen, (they had lost an infant daughter to whooping cough) and though Gross divorced Hopkins in 1930 shortly before Hopkins became a public figure, the two kept up an intimate correspondence until 1945. In 1931, Hopkins married Barbara Duncan, who died of cancer six years later. They had one daughter, Diana (1932–2020). In 1942, Hopkins married Louise Gill Macy (1906–1963) in the Yellow Oval Room at the White House. Macy was a divorced, gregarious former editor for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. The two continued to live at the White House at Roosevelt&#x27;s request, though Louise eventually demanded a home of their own. Hopkins ended his long White House stay on December 21, 1943, moving with his wife to a Georgetown townhouse.

==Cancer and death==
In mid-1939, Hopkins was told that he had stomach cancer, and doctors performed an extensive operation that removed 75% of his stomach. What remained of Hopkins&#x27;s stomach struggled to digest proteins and fat, and a few months after the operation, doctors stated that he had only four weeks to live. At this point, Roosevelt brought in experts, who transfused Hopkins with blood plasma that halted his deterioration. When the &quot;Phoney War&quot; phase of World War II ended in May 1940, the situation galvanized Hopkins; as Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote, &quot;the curative impact of Hopkins&#x27; increasingly crucial role in the war effort was to postpone the sentence of death the doctors had given him for five more years&quot;.

Though his death has been attributed to his stomach cancer, some historians have suggested that it was the cumulative malnutrition related to his post-cancer digestive problems. Another suggestion is that Hopkins died from liver failure due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, but Robert Sherwood authoritatively reported that Hopkins&#x27; postmortem examination showed the cause of death was hemosiderosis due to hepatic iron accumulation from his many blood transfusions and iron supplements. James A. Halsted, a medical doctor, noted nutrition researcher, and the third husband of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted, concluded that &quot;in light of all the available facts up to his death in 1946, it seems justifiable to speculate that he had non-tropical sprue or adult celiac disease (gluten enteropathy).&quot;

Hopkins died in New York City on January 29, 1946, at the age of 55. His body was cremated and his ashes interred in his former college town at the Hazelwood Cemetery in Grinnell, Iowa. There is a house on the Grinnell College campus named after him and his childhood home, with a plaque, is located at Sixth Avenue and Elm Street.

<text>Herpa Wings is a brand that identifies the die-cast model aircraft line of German company Herpa. The collection includes 250 airlines under 17 different aircraft manufacturers in 1:200 scale. The mainstay of Herpa Wings is in the 1:500 scale, while model airliners are also produced in the 1:400, 1:200, 1:1000, and 1:160 scales. Herpa Wings model airliners may also be used in conjunction with Herpa&#x27;s SCENIX series, which includes model diorama airports and airport accessories.

Herpa Wings has also produced model aircraft for many of the world&#x27;s international airlines, which include Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and others. These model aircraft are then sold exclusively by the airlines on board and are not included in the regular retail collection.

== History ==

===1949===

The company Hergenröther Patente was founded in Nuremberg by inventor and patent holder Wilhelm Hergenrother to produce accessories for model trains. The initials of the company&#x27;s name make up the word &quot;Herpa&quot;.

From 1949 to 1987, Herpa had been focusing exclusively on its Cars &amp; Trucks range. However, the first plastic samples of Boeing 747-200s in the 1:00 scale were produced for Lufthansa at an initiation ceremony for a Boeing 737-300 at Nuremberg Airport. Lufthansa then ordered from Herpa the production of the Lufthansa Model-Edition in the 1:200 scale exclusively for the airline.

In 1988, Herpa launched the Lufthansa Model-Edition with a highly detailed replica of the Boeing 737-300. Plans for historical models like the Junkers Ju 52 were also in development. With the advent of computer technology, in 1989 a partner company in Asia developed a new concept that would be able to create the same detail and precision available to the smaller 1:500 airplane models.

In 1990, the model airplanes sported authentic miniaturizations of the engines and rolling landing gear from the various manufacturers. By 1992, Herpa Wings is established. The first 1:500 scale plane miniatures are presented to the public at the Nuremberg Toy Fair, and several airlines place orders for planes in their respective liveries.

A licensing contract with aircraft manufacturer Boeing was signed in 1995. In 1996, Herpa Wings offered propeller driven planes for the first time with the release of an ATR-72 model. Also, Herpa Wings produced for Condor the replica of their anniversary plane, the &quot;Rizzi Bird&quot;, which is still one of the most difficult models in the Herpa Wings range. The first set of airport accessories was also produced.

In 1997, issue 1 of the magazine for collectors of airplane models, &quot;WingsWorld&quot;, is released in June. A new range of airplane replicas in the 1:200 scale are released. In 1999, the Herpa Wings Club and the first models of airport buildings in the 1:500 scale are produced. Herpa also celebrates its 50th anniversary in 1999.

In 2005, Herpa Wings introduced the MAGIC Collection featuring model aircraft in the scale 1:600, aiming to directly contend with at the time direct competitor Schabak. In September, a 1:1000 scale Airbus A380 model was also released. In 2006, the 1:1000 scale series of models were officially launched. The SCENIX range of airport accessories and dioramas were also introduced.

Today, Herpa Wings has been surpassed in terms of quality by a few other, newer competitors, it also competes with Phoenix Models, NG Models, Geminijets, and JC Wings (the latter also makes moulds for Geminijets).

== Hogan Wings ==
Hogan started as a separate brand formed in Hong Kong, but were bought by Herpa as a cheap option. Hogan models are made in 1:200, 1:400, 1:500 and 1:1000 scale. All Hogan 1:200 Models are snap-fit but detailed down to the landing gear.

== Herpa Wings Club ==
The Herpa Wings Club was established in 1999 in conjunction with Herpa&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Currently, members receive &quot;WingsWorld&quot;, a magazine for collectors of Herpa Wings. A free annual model in the 1:500 scale is also given, with options to purchase 4 exclusive models from the Club Edition. Members to the Club also enjoy discounts at the Herpa museum shop in Dietenhofen, Germany. The annual Herpa Wings folders are given free to members as well.

<text>Rein Taagepera (born 28 February 1933) is an Estonian political scientist and former politician.

== Education ==
Born in Tartu, Estonia, Taagepera fled from Soviet-occupied Estonia in 1944. Taagepera graduated from high school in Marrakech, Morocco, and then studied physics in Canada and the United States. He received a B.A. Sc (Nuclear Engineering) in 1959 and a M.A. (Physics) in 1961 from the University of Toronto, and a Ph.D. from the University of Delaware in 1965. Working in industry until 1970, he received another M.A. in international relations in 1969 and moved to academia as a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, where he stayed for his entire American career. Taagepera is professor emeritus at the University of Tartu.

== Political career ==
Taagepera served as president of the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies from 1986 until 1988. In 1991, he returned to Estonia as the founding dean of a new School of Social Sciences at the University of Tartu, which merged into a full-fledged faculty in 1994, and where he also became professor of political science (1994–1998).

In 1991, he was a member of the Estonian Constitutional Assembly, and in 1992, he ran as a presidential candidate against Arnold Rüütel (3rd President of the Republic of Estonia, 2001–2006), and Lennart Meri (2nd President of the Republic of Estonia, 1992–2001), who won the election. Taagepera came in third with 23% of the popular vote. Later Taagepera admitted that one of the reasons why he ran, despite having little chance to win, was to take away votes from Rüütel and thus help Meri rise to the presidency.

In 2003, Taagepera agreed to serve for half a year as the founding chairman of a new political party, Res Publica, which won the general elections that year and lead the governing coalition under Prime Minister Juhan Parts until April 2005. Taagepera tried to hold the party more or less in the middle of the spectrum (Taagepera even suggested he was centre-left politician). In 2005, Taagepera resigned his Res Publica membership, frustrated with the party&#x27;s leadership style and move to the right (refer to his essay, &quot;Meteoric trajectory&quot;). In April 2006, Res Publica decided to merge with the national-conservative Pro Patria Union party.

==Scholarly works==
Taagepera&#x27;s theoretical scholarly work, which mainly deals with electoral systems, is heavily quantitative and modelling in character and strongly informed by the epistemology of his previous field, physics. The quantitative approach is also his general attitude towards political science as a scholarly discipline. He recently systematized numerous contributions in electoral systems theory into a general, quantitative theoretical framework, exposed in the volume &quot;Predicting Party Sizes: The Logic of Simple Electoral Systems&quot; (2007).

Taagepera&#x27;s original epistemological and methodological approach, defined as &quot;logical quantitative modeling&quot;, is systematically presented in the recent volume &quot;Making Social Sciences More Scientific. The Need for Predictive Models&quot; (2008). Of special interest is his research in the World System hyperbolic growth.

Apart from the quantitative study of electoral and party systems, Taagepera has also published several studies of Estonian and Baltic history, politics, and culture. These latter, on the other hand, are more personal and take strong normative positions. Taagepera has also written award-winning pieces of prose (most notably &quot;Livland-Leaveland&quot; in 1990. It was awarded the Tuglas Prize in the same year).

<doc id="521263" wikidata="Q1944894" url="?curid=521263" title="Monkeystone Games">
<text>Monkeystone Games was a video game developer and publisher founded by John Romero, Tom Hall, Stevie Case, and Brian Moon. After its inception in July 2001, Monkeystone published several titles on multiple platforms.

==History==
Romero and Hall were co-founders of Ion Storm, and had previously worked together at Id Software on &quot;Doom&quot;. Case, who was Romero&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, had also worked at Ion Storm as a level designer. The three of them all worked on the commercially unsuccessful video game, &quot;Daikatana&quot;, which went through a turbulent development process before releasing in 2000 to negative reviews. Case left Ion Storm in January 2001, with Romero and Hall completing &quot;Anachronox&quot; before also leaving the company in July of that year.

Romero, Hall, and Case founded Monkeystone Games in Quinlan, Texas in August 2001, in order to explore the development of mobile games. According to Case, Romero became interested in the concept of mobile games towards the end of 1999, and wanted to see what was possible on handheld devices like the Pocket PC with a new company. Romero elaborated that he founded Monkeystone with the intent of directly working on programming video games full-time alongside Hall and Case. He noted, &quot;At Ion we were mainly working in management, managing people, but not able to do what we really wanted to do, and we were kind of torn between it.&quot; Joining the three were former Ion Storm employee Lucas Davis, as well as chief financial officer and chief operating officer Brian Moon, who previously worked for Ensemble Studios as their CFO.

In October 2001, Monkeystone announced their first game, &quot;Hyperspace Delivery Boy!&quot;, a Pocket PC title which began development in August 2001 and was released on December 23 of the same year. They also announced a partnership with ZIOSoft to collaborate on a future title. Following this, the company completed 2003&#x27;s &quot;Congo Cube&quot;, which was first released on Windows but later ported to BREW and J2ME. In August 2003, THQ Wireless announced that Monkeystone would develop a version of the 2001 console video game, &quot;Red Faction&quot;, for the Nokia N-Gage. It was completed in October 2003. Monkeystone also published titles developed by third parties, such as &quot;Bust&#x27;em&quot;, &quot;Argentum&quot;, and &quot;Baseball Mogul 2003&quot;, which were all released in 2002.

Romero recalled in a later interview that the reason he left Monkeystone was because he and Case ended their romantic relationship in the spring of 2003. Describing the breakup as the &quot;worst experience&quot; of his life, Romero sought to leave Texas to do something else. Hall decided to join his business partner, so they both left the company in October 2003, leaving Davis to run the company in their absence. Both Romero and Hall were hired at Midway Games the same month they left Monkeystone. During this time, Monkeystone worked on a game based on &quot;The&quot; &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; for the N-Gage that was eventually cancelled. According to Romero, the company moved to Austin, Texas to assist Midway Studios Austin with programming the multiplayer mode for its first-person shooter game, &quot;Area 51&quot;, enabling Romero and Hall to pay Monkeystone&#x27;s business loan off in full. After &quot;Area 51&quot;&#x27;s release in 2005, Monkeystone Games closed, with Romero and Hall each taking half of Monkeystone&#x27;s employees with them when they both left Midway.

==Games==
Their first in-house title, &quot;Hyperspace Delivery Boy!&quot; was first developed for the Pocket PC and released on December 23, 2001. The game was then ported to Windows, Mac, Linux and Game Boy Advance, although the Game Boy Advance version was never released. Monkeystone also published titles by third parties such as &quot;Argentum&quot;, &quot;Rocket Elite&quot;, &quot;Bust Em&quot;, &quot;Night Shift&quot;, and others.

Monkeystone&#x27;s second in-house title was a puzzler called &quot;Congo Cube&quot;. They initially developed Congo Cube for Windows, then ported it to the Pocket PC, Java ME phones, and BREW phones.

Their third in-house title was a recreation of the PlayStation 2 hit &quot;Red Faction&quot; on Nokia&#x27;s new gaming deck, N-Gage. It was completed in October 2003.

==Closure==
Brian Moon left Monkeystone sometime in 2002. Stevie Case left Monkeystone in mid-2003. Tom Hall and John Romero left Monkeystone in October 2003 to work at Midway Games. One of their colleagues, Lucas Davis, was left to run the day-to-day operations until the company closed in January 2005.

==Legacy==
In 2022, former id Software John Carmack praised Monkeystone Games, particularly his former colleague Romero for transitioning into the mobile games industry. It inspired him to start his own mobile games as well beginning with &quot;Doom RPG&quot; and &quot;Orcs &amp; Elves&quot; that were released in 2005 and 2006 respectively.

<text>Reflection is the change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound and water waves. The &quot;law of reflection&quot; says that for specular reflection (for example at a mirror) the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected.

In acoustics, reflection causes echoes and is used in sonar. In geology, it is important in the study of seismic waves. Reflection is observed with surface waves in bodies of water. Reflection is observed with many types of electromagnetic wave, besides visible light. Reflection of VHF and higher frequencies is important for radio transmission and for radar. Even hard X-rays and gamma rays can be reflected at shallow angles with special &quot;grazing&quot; mirrors.

==Reflection of light==
Reflection of light is either &quot;specular&quot; (mirror-like) or &quot;diffuse&quot; (retaining the energy, but losing the image) depending on the nature of the interface. In specular reflection the phase of the reflected waves depends on the choice of the origin of coordinates, but the relative phase between s and p (TE and TM) polarizations is fixed by the properties of the media and of the interface between them.

A mirror provides the most common model for specular light reflection, and typically consists of a glass sheet with a metallic coating where the significant reflection occurs. Reflection is enhanced in metals by suppression of wave propagation beyond their skin depths. Reflection also occurs at the surface of transparent media, such as water or glass.
In the diagram, a light ray PO strikes a vertical mirror at point O, and the reflected ray is OQ. By projecting an imaginary line through point O perpendicular to the mirror, known as the &quot;normal&quot;, we can measure the &quot;angle of incidence&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;i and the &quot;angle of reflection&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;r. The &quot;law of reflection&quot; states that &quot;θ&quot;i = θ&quot;r, or in other words, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

In fact, reflection of light may occur whenever light travels from a medium of a given refractive index into a medium with a different refractive index. In the most general case, a certain fraction of the light is reflected from the interface, and the remainder is refracted. Solving Maxwell&#x27;s equations for a light ray striking a boundary allows the derivation of the Fresnel equations, which can be used to predict how much of the light is reflected, and how much is refracted in a given situation. This is analogous to the way impedance mismatch in an electric circuit causes reflection of signals. Total internal reflection of light from a denser medium occurs if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.

Total internal reflection is used as a means of focusing waves that cannot effectively be reflected by common means. X-ray telescopes are constructed by creating a converging &quot;tunnel&quot; for the waves. As the waves interact at low angle with the surface of this tunnel they are reflected toward the focus point (or toward another interaction with the tunnel surface, eventually being directed to the detector at the focus). A conventional reflector would be useless as the X-rays would simply pass through the intended reflector.

When light reflects off a material with higher refractive index than the medium in which is traveling, it undergoes a 180° phase shift. In contrast, when light reflects off a material with lower refractive index the reflected light is in phase with the incident light. This is an important principle in the field of thin-film optics.

Specular reflection forms images. Reflection from a flat surface forms a mirror image, which appears to be reversed from left to right because we compare the image we see to what we would see if we were rotated into the position of the image. Specular reflection at a curved surface forms an image which may be magnified or demagnified; curved mirrors have optical power. Such mirrors may have surfaces that are spherical or parabolic.


===Laws of reflection===
If the reflecting surface is very smooth, the reflection of light that occurs is called specular or regular reflection. The laws of reflection are as follows:
#The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the reflection surface at the point of the incidence lie in the same plane.
#The angle which the incident ray makes with the normal is equal to the angle which the reflected ray makes to the same normal.
#The reflected ray and the incident ray are on the opposite sides of the normal.

These three laws can all be derived from the Fresnel equations.

====Mechanism====

In classical electrodynamics, light is considered as an electromagnetic wave, which is described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Light waves incident on a material induce small oscillations of polarisation in the individual atoms (or oscillation of electrons, in metals), causing each particle to radiate a small secondary wave in all directions, like a dipole antenna. All these waves add up to give specular reflection and refraction, according to the Huygens–Fresnel principle.

In the case of dielectrics such as glass, the electric field of the light acts on the electrons in the material, and the moving electrons generate fields and become new radiators. The refracted light in the glass is the combination of the forward radiation of the electrons and the incident light. The reflected light is the combination of the backward radiation of all of the electrons.

In metals, electrons with no binding energy are called free electrons. When these electrons oscillate with the incident light, the phase difference between their radiation field and the incident field is π (180°), so the forward radiation cancels the incident light, and backward radiation is just the reflected light.

Light–matter interaction in terms of photons is a topic of quantum electrodynamics, and is described in detail by Richard Feynman in his popular book &quot;QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter&quot;.

===Diffuse reflection===
When light strikes the surface of a (non-metallic) material it bounces off in all directions due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities &quot;inside&quot; the material (e.g. the grain boundaries of a polycrystalline material, or the cell or fiber boundaries of an organic material) and by its surface, if it is rough. Thus, an &#x27;image&#x27; is not formed. This is called &quot;diffuse reflection&quot;. The exact form of the reflection depends on the structure of the material. One common model for diffuse reflection is Lambertian reflectance, in which the light is reflected with equal luminance (in photometry) or radiance (in radiometry) in all directions, as defined by Lambert&#x27;s cosine law.

The light sent to our eyes by most of the objects we see is due to diffuse reflection from their surface, so that this is our primary mechanism of physical observation.

===Retroreflection===
Some surfaces exhibit &quot;retroreflection&quot;. The structure of these surfaces is such that light is returned in the direction from which it came.

When flying over clouds illuminated by sunlight the region seen around the aircraft&#x27;s shadow will appear brighter, and a similar effect may be seen from dew on grass. This partial retro-reflection is created by the refractive properties of the curved droplet&#x27;s surface and reflective properties at the backside of the droplet.

Some animals&#x27; retinas act as retroreflectors (see &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; for more detail), as this effectively improves the animals&#x27; night vision. Since the lenses of their eyes modify reciprocally the paths of the incoming and outgoing light the effect is that the eyes act as a strong retroreflector, sometimes seen at night when walking in wildlands with a flashlight.

A simple retroreflector can be made by placing three ordinary mirrors mutually perpendicular to one another (a corner reflector). The image produced is the inverse of one produced by a single mirror. 
A surface can be made partially retroreflective by depositing a layer of tiny refractive spheres on it or by creating small pyramid like structures. In both cases internal reflection causes the light to be reflected back to where it originated. This is used to make traffic signs and automobile license plates reflect light mostly back in the direction from which it came. In this application perfect retroreflection is not desired, since the light would then be directed back into the headlights of an oncoming car rather than to the driver&#x27;s eyes.

=== Multiple reflections ===

When light reflects off a mirror, one image appears. Two mirrors placed exactly face to face give the appearance of an infinite number of images along a straight line. The multiple images seen between two mirrors that sit at an angle to each other lie over a circle. The center of that circle is located at the imaginary intersection of the mirrors. A square of four mirrors placed face to face give the appearance of an infinite number of images arranged in a plane. The multiple images seen between four mirrors assembling a pyramid, in which each pair of mirrors sits an angle to each other, lie over a sphere. If the base of the pyramid is rectangle shaped, the images spread over a section of a torus.

Note that these are theoretical ideals, requiring perfect alignment of perfectly smooth, perfectly flat perfect reflectors that absorb none of the light. In practice, these situations can only be approached but not achieved because the effects of any surface imperfections in the reflectors propagate and magnify, absorption gradually extinguishes the image, and any observing equipment (biological or technological) will interfere.

===Complex conjugate reflection===
In this process (which is also known as phase conjugation), light bounces exactly back in the direction from which it came due to a nonlinear optical process. Not only the direction of the light is reversed, but the actual wavefronts are reversed as well. A conjugate reflector can be used to remove aberrations from a beam by reflecting it and then passing the reflection through the aberrating optics a second time. If one were to look into a complex conjugating mirror, it would be black because only the photons which left the pupil would reach the pupil.

==Other types of reflection==

===Neutron reflection===
Materials that reflect neutrons, for example beryllium, are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. In the physical and biological sciences, the reflection of neutrons off atoms within a material is commonly used to determine the material&#x27;s internal structure.

===Sound reflection===

When a longitudinal sound wave strikes a flat surface, sound is reflected in a coherent manner provided that the dimension of the reflective surface is large compared to the wavelength of the sound. Note that audible sound has a very wide frequency range (from 20 to about 17000 Hz), and thus a very wide range of wavelengths (from about 20 mm to 17 m). As a result, the overall nature of the reflection varies according to the texture and structure of the surface. For example, porous materials will absorb some energy, and rough materials (where rough is relative to the wavelength) tend to reflect in many directions—to scatter the energy, rather than to reflect it coherently. This leads into the field of architectural acoustics, because the nature of these reflections is critical to the auditory feel of a space. 
In the theory of exterior noise mitigation, reflective surface size mildly detracts from the concept of a noise barrier by reflecting some of the sound into the opposite direction. Sound reflection can affect the acoustic space.

===Seismic reflection===

Seismic waves produced by earthquakes or other sources (such as explosions) may be reflected by layers within the Earth. Study of the deep reflections of waves generated by earthquakes has allowed seismologists to determine the layered structure of the Earth. Shallower reflections are used in reflection seismology to study the Earth&#x27;s crust generally, and in particular to prospect for petroleum and natural gas deposits.

<doc id="521270" wikidata="Q2461191" url="?curid=521270" title="Pin the tail on the donkey">
<text>Pin the tail on the donkey is a game played by groups of children. The earliest version listed in a catalog of American games compiled by the American Game Collectors Association in 1998, is dated 1899, and attributed to Kate Hunt. 

It is common at birthday parties and other gatherings. A picture of a donkey with a missing tail is tacked to a wall within easy reach of children.
One at a time, each child is blindfolded and handed a paper &quot;tail&quot; with a push pin or thumbtack poked through it. The blindfolded child is then spun around until disoriented. The child gropes around and tries to pin the tail on the donkey. The player who pins their tail closest to the target, the donkey&#x27;s rear, wins. The game, a group activity, is generally not competitive; &quot;winning&quot; is only of marginal importance. It is often seen as more entertaining, seeing the children stumble around and try to put their tail at the right place.

The game is also used in child development research.

The game can also be played by teenagers and adults, especially if the &quot;donkey&quot; is replaced with depictions of something or someone else. As a drinking game, the person with the worst tail pinning is awarded one shot of a selected alcohol, to be determined by house rules or the loser in a friendly environment.

Idiomatically, the term can be used derisively for any assigned activity which is pointless or for which a person has been handicapped (blindfolded).

<doc id="521275" wikidata="Q286374" url="?curid=521275" title="Karambit">
<text>The karambit or kerambit (as used in Indonesian), kurambik or karambiak (both from the Minangkabau language) is a small curved knife resembling a claw. It is most closely associated with the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra, Indonesia, but is also found throughout other ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. The karambit is one of the weapons commonly used in pencak silat and Filipino martial arts.

==Origin==
The karambit was originally an agricultural implement designed to rake roots, gather threshing and plant rice in most of island Southeast Asia. It&#x27;s a smaller variant of the Southeast Asian sickles (Indonesian &quot;celurit&quot;, &quot;arit&quot;, or &quot;sabit&quot;; Filipino &quot;garab&quot; and &quot;karit&quot;; and Malaysian &quot;sabit&quot;). It still possesses many efficient uses for the modern laborer, allowing use of the blade for utility work, with the finger ring eliminating the need to put the knife down between operations, if use of the fingers to manipulate the object to be worked on is required (such as the action of cutting and opening a shipping box, or removing plastic wrap from shipments, in two very basic examples). The finger ring also provides an added degree of protection against dropping the knife during use, which is particularly essential in work environments that include heavy machinery, into which dropping a handheld, metal tool of any kind can cause massive damage to the equipment and those around it, especially if the tool is ejected at high velocity from rotating components. The karambit is believed to have originally been weaponized among the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra where, according to folklore, it was inspired by the claws of a tiger. As it was weaponised, the blade became more curved to maximise cutting potential. Through Indonesia&#x27;s trade network and close contact with neighbouring countries, the weaponization of the karambit was eventually dispersed through what are now Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.

European accounts tell that soldiers in Indonesia were armed with a kris at their waist or back and a spear in their hands, while the karambit was used as a last resort when the fighter&#x27;s other weapons were lost in battle. The renowned Bugis warriors of Sulawesi were famous for their embrace of the karambit. Today it is one of the main weapons of silat and is commonly used in Filipino martial arts as well.

Superficially, the karambit resembles the jambiyah, although there is no connection. The jambiyah was always designed as a weapon and serves as a status marker, often made by skilled artisans and jewelers using precious stones and metals, whereas the karambit was and still remains an unadorned farmer&#x27;s implement and utility knife.

==Technique==
The karambit is held with the blade pointing downward from the bottom of the fist, usually curving forwards. While it is primarily used in a slashing or hooking motion, karambit with a finger ring are also used in a punching motion hitting the opponent with the finger ring. Some karambit are designed to be used in a hammering motion. This flexibility of striking methods is what makes it useful in self-defense situations. The finger guard makes it difficult to disarm and allows the knife to be maneuvered in the fingers without losing one&#x27;s grip.

The short Filipino karambit has found some favor in the West because such proponents allege the biomechanics of the weapon allow for more powerful cutting strokes and painful &quot;ripping&quot; wounds, and because its usability is hypothesized as more intuitive, but more difficult to master than a classic knife.
==Variations==
There are many regional variants of karambit. The length of the blade, for example, could vary from one village or blacksmith to another. Some have no finger guard and some feature two blades, one on each side of the handle. Traditional types include:
* &quot;Kuku Bima&quot;: Bhima&#x27;s claw from West Java
* &quot;Kuku Hanuman&quot;: Hanuman&#x27;s claw from West Java
* &quot;Kuku Macan&quot;: tiger&#x27;s claw, endemic to Sumatra, Central Java and Madura
* &quot;Kerambit Sumbawa&quot;: larger, sturdier kerambit made specially for battle. From the Sumba Islands
* &quot;Kerambit Lombok&quot;: larger, sturdier kerambit made specially for battle. From Lombok
* &quot;Lawi Ayam&quot;: chicken&#x27;s claw, created by the Minang community

Additionally, modern karambit may have spikes or spurs on the front or rear ricasso, which may be intended for gripping clothing or horse tack, tearing flesh or for injecting a poison, such as the upas.

===Modern forms===
The modern Western interpretation of the karambit is far removed from the original agricultural tool. They may have folding blades, are finished to a high standard, made from expensive materials as opposed to being rudimentary and makeshift and are generally larger to accommodate larger hands giving it pure shape.

<doc id="521281" wikidata="Q1089250" url="?curid=521281" title="Bel Riose">
<text>Bel Riose is a fictional character in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series by Isaac Asimov. In the 1945 novella &quot;Dead Hand&quot;, he is the last great general of the declining Galactic Empire. He targets the Foundation both as a perceived threat to the Empire and to further his own ambitions, but is outmaneuvered by its agents.

Riose is voiced by Dinsdale Landen in the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation &quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot;. He is portrayed by Ben Daniels in season two of the 2021 Apple TV+ television series adaptation &quot;Foundation&quot;.

== Literature ==
Bel Riose appears in the novella &quot;Dead Hand&quot;, published in the April 1945 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. It was later retitled &quot;The General&quot; and paired with the November/December 1945 novella &quot;The Mule&quot;, and published as &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; in 1952.

=== Description ===
Riose is loosely based on Belisarius, a great general of the Roman Empire who served Justinian I during the 6th century AD. Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; wrote:

James E. Gunn saw Riose as &quot;the only character who stares in the face of determinism&quot;. While his failure against the forces of historic necessity might seem depressing, the fact that he is not the viewpoint character changes the impact of the story: The reader sympathizes with the Foundation. Riose&#x27;s failure is depicted as desirable, as it ensures the Foundation&#x27;s survival.

=== Plot ===

In &quot;Dead Hand&quot;, Imperial General Bel Riose governs the planet Siwenna. He investigates the Foundation and is soon determined to destroy it, both as a perceived threat to the Empire and to further his own ambitions. Foundation trader Lathan Devers lets himself be captured by Riose to disrupt his overtures against the Foundation from the inside. With Emperor Cleon II&#x27;s Privy Secretary Ammel Brodrig present to observe Riose, Devers attempts to implicate Riose in a nonexistent attempt to overthrow Cleon. His machinations are exposed, but Ducem Barr, a Foundation sympathizer forced to aid Riose, helps him escape further interrogation by knocking Riose unconscious and fleeing the planet with Devers in tow. They travel to the Imperial capital planet, Trantor, and plot to influence Cleon directly with Devers&#x27; invented conspiracy, implicating both Riose and Brodrig. Though they are caught by the Secret Police, they escape and later learn that Riose and Brodrig have been arrested for treason and executed. Asimov later explains the political dynamics of why Riose would never have been able to defeat the Foundation: a strong emperor&#x27;s sense of self-preservation would never allow him to tolerate a subordinate who develops potentially threatening power.

== Adaptations ==

=== Radio ===
Riose is voiced by Dinsdale Landen in episode four &quot;The General&quot; of the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation &quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot;.

=== Television ===

Riose is portrayed by Ben Daniels in season two of the 2021 Apple TV+ television series adaptation &quot;Foundation&quot;. He is the last great general of the Superliminal Fleet, imprisoned by Emperor Cleon for breaking orders to save troops, despite still achieving a victory. Riose is described as &quot;noble to a fault, but his fealty to the Galactic Empire is waning.&quot; The Empire has learned that the Foundation has not been destroyed as had been previously believed, and is in fact flourishing and amassing influence. Riose, known to be ruthless and unpredictable, seems the perfect military leader to set upon the Foundation, but he is also bitter toward the Empire. Sean T. Collins of &quot;Decider&quot; wrote, &quot;I enjoyed Bel Riose&#x27;s case for rejoining the government that destroyed him even though Empire clearly fears his strength: As the only human whom Cleon does &quot;not&quot; see as dispensable, it&#x27;s his responsibility to protect the citizens of the Empire, since Empire himself cannot and will not.&quot; 

==== Storyline ====
In the 2023 episode &quot;King and Commoner&quot;, Cleon&#x27;s emissary Lady Demerzel visits Riose at the Lepsis penal colony, offering him his freedom to investigate the Foundation on behalf of the Empire. He is also reunited with his husband and former second-in-command, Glawen Curr, both men having been previously told that the other was executed. In &quot;Where the Stars are Scattered Thinly&quot;, Riose and Curr visit Imperial informant Ducem Barr on Siwenna and learn that the Foundation, and by extension their propagandists the Church of the Galactic Spirit, possess auras, protective force shield technology forbidden to everyone except the Emperors, and whisper-ships, a Foundation-created type of jumpship which can perform faster-than-light travel without requiring an enhanced human Spacer to navigate. As Riose and Curr flee an anti-Imperial mob, Riose mercy kills Barr at his request. Riose and Curr debate their options for turning against Empire in &quot;A Necessary Death&quot;, but Riose ultimately declares any such action to be too great a risk.

The Imperial fleet faces off against the Foundation in &quot;Long Ago, Not Far Away&quot;, and Riose believes he can end the conflict without violence. But the Emperor clone Brother Day, baited by Hari Seldon, orders Riose to crash the &quot;Invictus&quot;, an ancient Imperial warship commandeered by the Foundation, into Terminus to devastate the planet and destroy the Foundation. Riose reluctantly does so, even though he knows Curr is on the surface. In the season two finale &quot;Creation Myths&quot;, She-Bends-Light, a Spacer on Riose&#x27;s flagship &quot;Shining Destiny&quot;, uses a jump sequence smuggled onboard by con man Hober Mallow to program the fleet&#x27;s warships to jump into one another, which will inevitably consume the entire fleet and free the remaining Spacers from Empire. Riose battles Day in hand-to-hand combat, and uses Mallow&#x27;s castling device to switch places with Day via teleportation, venting the Emperor into space and killing him. Trapped on the doomed flagship, Riose and Mallow share a toast as the &quot;Shining Destiny&quot; explodes. Meanwhile, Curr and the population of Terminus have escaped the planet&#x27;s destruction via Seldon&#x27;s Vault.

==== Reception ====
Collins wrote, &quot;Ben Daniels, who goes from a hermit of the wastes to one of the handsomest men on TV with a shave and a haircut, has a great deal of screen presence as Bel&quot;. Series executive producer David S. Goyer called Riose his favorite &quot;Foundation&quot; character. He said that the deaths of Riose and Mallow were always planned for season two, adding that &quot;I like that they meet their fates twinned together&quot;. Gary Grimes of &quot;Attitude&quot; described the emotional reunion of Riose and Curr as &quot;a cornerstone moment in the high-octane series.&quot; The series depicts their homosexuality as a non-issue. Curr&#x27;s portrayer, Dino Fetscher, said &quot;It was so refreshing that our characters&#x27; sexualities were just incidental ... In this world, sexuality is very different. It&#x27;s just the same as you have blue eyes and I have brown eyes. In lots of ways, it&#x27;s really inspiring because it&#x27;s not so far in the future.&quot;

<text>Critical infrastructure, or critical national infrastructure (CNI) in the UK, describes infrastructure considered essential by governments for the functioning of a society and economy and deserving of special protection for national security. Critical infrastructure has traditionally been viewed as under the scope of government due to its strategic importance, yet there is an observable trend towards its privatization, raising discussions about how the private sector can contribute to these essential services.

==Items==
Most commonly associated with the term are assets and facilities for:
* Shelter; Heating (e.g. natural gas, fuel oil, district heating);
* Agriculture, food production and distribution;
* Education, skills development and technology transfer / basic subsistence and unemployment rate statistics;
* Water supply (drinking water, waste water/sewage, stemming of surface water (e.g. dikes and sluices));
* Public health (hospitals, ambulances);
* Transportation systems (fuel supply, railway network, airports, harbours, inland shipping);
* Security services (police, military).
* Electricity generation, transmission and distribution; (e.g. natural gas, fuel oil, coal, nuclear power)
** Renewable energy, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.
* Telecommunication; coordination for successful operations
* Economic sector; Goods and services and financial services (banking, clearing);

==Protection programmes==

===Canada ===
The Canadian Federal Government identifies the following 10 Critical Infrastructure Sectors as a way to classify essential assets. 
# Energy &amp; Utilities: Electricity providers; off-shore/on-shore oil &amp; gas; coal supplies, natural gas providers; home fuel oil; gas station supplies; alternative energy suppliers (wind, solar, other)
# Information and Communication Technology: Broadcast Media; telecommunication providers (landlines, cell phones, internet, wifi); Postal services; 
# Finance: Banking services, government finance/aid departments; taxation
# Health: Public health &amp; wellness programs, hospital/clinic facilities; blood &amp; blood products
# Food: Food supply chains; food inspectors; import/export programs; grocery stores; Agri &amp; Acqua culture; farmers markets
# Water: Water supply &amp; protection; wastewater management; fisheries &amp; ocean protection programs
# Transportation: Roads, bridges, railways, aviation/airports; shipping &amp; ports; transit
# Safety: Emergency responders; public safety programs
# Government: Military; Continuity of governance
# Manufacturing: Industry, economic development

===European Union===
European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) refers to the doctrine or specific programs created as a result of the European Commission&#x27;s directive EU COM(2006) 786 which designates European critical infrastructure that, in case of fault, incident, or attack, could impact both the country where it is hosted and at least one other European Member State. Member states are obliged to adopt the 2006 directive into their national statutes.

It has proposed a list of European critical infrastructures based upon inputs by its member states.
Each designated European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) will have to have an Operator Security Plan (OSP) covering the identification of important assets, a risk analysis based on major threat scenarios and the vulnerability of each asset, and the identification, selection and prioritisation of counter-measures and procedures.

===Germany===
The German critical-infrastructure protection programme KRITIS is coordinated by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Some of its special agencies like the German Federal Office for Information Security or the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance BBK deliver the respective content, e.g., about IT systems.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, critical infrastructures are mandated under the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. In 2017, the Infrastructure Protection Act was passed in Parliament, which provides for the protection of certain areas, places and other premises in Singapore against security risks. It came into force in 2018.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, the National Protective Security Authority (NPSA) provides information, personnel and physical security advice to the businesses and organizations which make up the UK&#x27;s national infrastructure, helping to reduce its vulnerability to terrorism and other threats.

It can call on resources from other government departments and agencies, including MI5, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and other government departments responsible for national infrastructure sectors.

===United States===
The U.S. has had a wide-reaching critical infrastructure protection program in place since 1996. Its Patriot Act of 2001 defined critical infrastructure as those &quot;systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.&quot;

In 2014 the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was published, and quickly became a popular set of guidelines, despite the significant costs of full compliance.

These have identified a number of critical infrastructures and responsible agencies:

# Agriculture and food – Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services
# Water – Environmental Protection Agency
# Public Health – Department of Health and Human Services
# Emergency Services – Department of Homeland Security
# Government – Department of Homeland Security
# Defense Industrial Base – Department of Defense
# Information and Telecommunications – Department of Commerce
# Energy – Department of Energy
# Transportation and Shipping – Department of Transportation
# Banking and Finance – Department of the Treasury
# Chemical Industry and Hazardous Materials – Department of Homeland Security
# Post – Department of Homeland Security
# National monuments and icons - Department of the Interior
# Critical manufacturing - Department of Homeland Security (14th sector announced March 3, 2008; recorded April 30, 2008)

====National Infrastructure Protection Plan====
The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure sector in the US. Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), issued in February 2013 entitled Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience mandated an update to the NIPP. This revision of the plan established the following 16 critical infrastructure sectors:

# Chemical
# Commercial facilities
# Communications
# Critical manufacturing
# Dams
# Defense industrial base
# Emergency services
# Energy
# Financial services
# Food and agriculture
# Government facilities
# Healthcare and public health
# Information technology
# Nuclear reactors, materials, and waste
# Transportation systems
# Water and wastewater systems

National Monuments and Icons along with the postal and shipping sector were removed in 2013 update to the NIPP. The 2013 version of the NIPP has faced criticism for lacking viable risk measures. The plan assigns the following agencies sector-specific coordination responsibilities:

; Department of Homeland Security
* Chemical
* Commercial facilities
* Communications
* Critical manufacturing
* Dams
* Emergency services
* Government facilities (jointly with General Services Administration)
* Information technology
* Nuclear reactors, materials, and waste
* Transportation systems (jointly with Department of Transportation)

; Department of Defense
* Defense industrial base

; Department of Energy
* Energy

; Department of the Treasury
* Financial services

; Department of Agriculture
* Food and agriculture

; General Services Administration
* Government facilities (jointly with Department of Homeland Security)

; Department of Health and Human Services
* Healthcare and Public Health

; Department of Transportation
* Transportation systems (jointly with Department of Homeland Security)

; Environmental Protection Agency
* Water and wastewater systems

====State-level legislation====
Several U.S. states have passed &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; bills, promoted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), to criminalize protests against the fossil fuel industry. In May 2017, Oklahoma passed legislation which created felony penalties for trespassing on land considered critical infrastructure, including oil and gas pipelines, or conspiring to do so; ALEC introduced a version of the bill as a model act and encouraged other states to adopt it. In June 2020, West Virginia passed the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, which created felony penalties for protests against oil and gas facilities.

==Stress testing==
Critical infrastructure (CI) such as highways, railways, electric power networks, dams, port facilities, major gas pipelines or oil refineries are exposed to multiple natural and human-induced hazards and stressors, including earthquakes, landslides, floods, tsunami, wildfires, climate change effects or explosions. These stressors and abrupt events can cause failures and losses, and hence, can interrupt essential services for the society and the economy. Therefore, CI owners and operators need to identify and quantify the risks posed by the CIs due to different stressors, in order to define mitigation strategies and improve the resilience of the CIs. Stress tests are advanced and standardised tools for hazard and risk assessment of CIs, that include both low-probability high-consequence (LP-HC) events and so-called extreme or rare events, as well as the systematic application of these new tools to classes of CI.

Stress testing is the process of assessing the ability of a CI to maintain a certain level of functionality under unfavourable conditions, while stress tests consider LP-HC events, which are not always accounted for in the design and risk assessment procedures, commonly adopted by public authorities or industrial stakeholders. A multilevel stress test methodology for CI has been developed in the framework of the European research project STREST, consisting of four phases:

Phase 1: &quot;Preassessment&quot;, during which the data available on the CI (risk context) and on the phenomena of interest (hazard context) are collected. The goal and objectives, the time frame, the stress test level and the total costs of the stress test are defined.

Phase 2: &quot;Assessment&quot;, during which the stress test at the component and the system scope is performed, including fragility and risk analysis of the CIs for the stressors defined in Phase 1. The stress test can result in three outcomes: Pass, Partly Pass and Fail, based on the comparison of the quantified risks to acceptable risk exposure levels and a penalty system.

Phase 3: &quot;Decision&quot;, during which the results of the stress test are analyzed according to the goal and objectives defined in Phase 1. Critical events (events that most likely cause the exceedance of a given level of loss) and risk mitigation strategies are identified.

Phase 4: &quot;Report&quot;, during which the stress test outcome and risk mitigation guidelines based on the findings established in Phase 3 are formulated and presented to the stakeholders.

This stress-testing methodology has been demonstrated to six CIs in Europe at component and system level: an oil refinery and petrochemical plant in Milazzo, Italy; a conceptual alpine earth-fill dam in Switzerland; the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline in Turkey; part of the Gasunie national gas storage and distribution network in the Netherlands; the port infrastructure of Thessaloniki, Greece; and an industrial district in the region of Tuscany, Italy. The outcome of the stress testing included the definition of critical components and events and risk mitigation strategies, which are formulated and reported to stakeholders.

<text>Trbovlje (; ) is Slovenia&#x27;s eleventh-largest town, located in the traditional province of Styria and acting as the seat of the Municipality of Trbovlje. A historically renowned mining town, Trbovlje is located in the valley of a minor left tributary of the Sava River in the Central Sava Valley in central-eastern Slovenia.

==Name==
Trbovlje was attested in written sources in 1220–30 as &quot;Trefeul&quot; (and as &quot;Trevůl&quot; and &quot;Trevol&quot; in 1265–67, &quot;Triuella&quot; in 1302, &quot;Trifeul&quot; in 1325, &quot;Triueal&quot; in 1330, and &quot;Triuel&quot; in 1424). The name is a feminine plural noun in standard Slovene, but in the local dialect it is declined as a neuter singular adjective. This indicates that the name is derived from &quot;*Trěbovľe selo&quot; (literally, &#x27;Trěbo&#x27;s village&#x27;), referring to an early inhabitant of the place. In the past the German name was &quot;Trifail&quot;.

==History==
Coal mining began at Beech Mountain (, ) south of the town in 1804. The town was connected to the Austrian Southern Railway in 1849, which contributed to its further development. During the 19th century, a cement plant, mechanical separator, sawmill, and power plant were built in Trbovlje.

Poor social conditions in Trbovlje led to several strikes by mine workers, and the town became a center of the leftist movement and communist agitation. On June 1, 1924, there was a clash between workers and members of the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists that resulted in several fatalities on both sides. In 1934, miners staged a sitdown strike at the mine.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, Trbovlje, along with the rest of Lower Styria, was annexed to the Third Reich. The coal mine and other industries of Trbovlje were especially important to the German authorities, and they initially lowered unemployment in the town and increased wages, increasing satisfaction with the new regime. However, the arrest and exile of Slovenes in August 1941 created disaffection. This and other repressive measures resulted in an estimated 90% of the population opposing the Germans by the summer of 1944.

===Mass grave===
The Abandoned Cemetery Mass Grave () site, associated with World War II, is located in the former cemetery in the northern part of the town, between the fence and Trboveljščica Creek. It is also known as the Town Park Mass Grave (), and it contains the remains of about 30 German soldiers.

==Culture==
The Trbovlje Museum () has a large section dedicated to the history of mining. 

The Slovenian industrial band Laibach also originated in Trbovlje.

The Trbovlje Student Club organization () holds various events.

==Economy==

Trbovlje is known for its long coal mining history. Trbovlje is also known for Trbovlje Power Station, which is the location of European Union&#x27;s tallest chimney at 360 meters. In the past there were companies like respected Strojna Tovarna Trbovlje - STT, well known Iskra, Mehanika, Cementarna Trbovlje, et cetera that have employed many high skilled people and contributed to the economy. Due to their size this was not felt only locally but nationally.

==Parishes and churches==
Two Roman Catholic parishes have their seat in Trbovlje: the Parish of Trbovlje–St. Martin and the Parish of Trbovlje–St. Mary. Both belong to the Diocese of Celje.

The Parish Church of St Martin was originally a Romanesque church, of which part of the nave survives. The sanctuary is Gothic and in the 18th century a Baroque belfry and chapel were added. In the 19th century the nave was extended. A second church of the Parish of Trbovlje–St. Martin in the western end of town is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and was built in the 18th century.

The Parish of Trbovlje–St Mary in the southern part of the town was established in 2000. Its parish church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church. It was built from 1998 to 2000 according to plans by the architect Jože Marinko. Stained glasses, paintings, and the Stations of the Cross were created by the academy-trained painter Lojze Čemažar. The church was blessed in August 2000 and consecrated in October 2007.

A significant portion of Trbovlje&#x27;s populace today describe themselves as atheists, in third place behind Catholic and &quot;no response.&quot;

==Twin places==
* Sallaumines, northern France since 1964. There is a street in Sallaumines named Trbovlje, and a street in Trbovlje named Sallaumines. There are also regular short-term exchanges of schoolchildren.

<doc id="521296" wikidata="Q464037" url="?curid=521296" title="Caresse Crosby">
<text>Caresse Crosby (born Mary Phelps Jacob; April 20, 1892 – January 24, 1970) was the recipient of a patent for the first successful modern bra, an American patron of the arts, a publisher, and the woman &quot;Time&quot; called the &quot;literary godmother to the Lost Generation of expatriate writers in Paris.&quot; She and her second husband, Harry Crosby, founded the Black Sun Press, which was instrumental in publishing some of the early works of many authors who would later become famous, among them Anaïs Nin, Kay Boyle, Ernest Hemingway, Archibald MacLeish, Henry Miller, Charles Bukowski, Hart Crane, and Robert Duncan.

== Early life and education ==
Born on April 20, 1891, in New Rochelle, New York, she was the oldest child of Mary (née Phelps) Jacob and William Hearn Jacob, who were both descended from American colonial families—her mother from the William Phelps family, and her father from the Van Rensselaers. Her mother was the daughter of Civil War General Walter Phelps, and she had two brothers, Leonard and Walter &quot;Bud&quot; Phelps Jacob. She was nicknamed &quot;Polly&quot; to distinguish her from her mother.

Polly&#x27;s family was not fabulously rich, but her father had been raised, as she put it, &quot;to ride to hounds, sail boats, and lead cotillions,&quot; and he lived extravagantly. In 1914, the family presented her to the King of England at a garden party. In keeping with the American aristocratic style of the times, she was even photographed as a child by Charles Dana Gibson, for whom the iconic term &quot;Gibson girl&quot; was coined.

She grew up, she later said, &quot;in a world where only good smells existed. What I wanted usually came to pass.&quot; She was an uninterested student. Author Geoffrey Wolff wrote that for the most part Polly &quot;lived her life in dreams.&quot;

Her family divided its time between estates in Manhattan at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, in Watertown, Connecticut, and in New Rochelle, New York, and she enjoyed the advantages of an upper-class lifestyle. She attended formal balls, Ivy League school dances, and received equestrian training at a horse riding school. She studied dance at the studio of composer and society tastemaker Allen Dodsworth, attended Miss Chapin&#x27;s School in New York City, and then boarded at Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Wallingford, Connecticut that later merged to form Choate Rosemary Hall, where she played the part of Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; to critical acclaim.

After her father&#x27;s death in 1908, she lived with her mother at their home in Watertown, Connecticut. That same year she met her future husband, Richard Peabody, at summer camp. Her brother Len was boarding at Westminster School, and Bud was a day student at Taft School. Approaching her own debut, she danced in balls most nights, and slept from four in the morning until noon. &quot;At twelve I was called and got ready for the customary debutante luncheon.&quot; She graduated from Rosemary Hall in 1910, at age 19.

== Development of the backless brassiere ==
That same year, Crosby prepared to attend a débutante ball one evening. As was customary, she put on a corset stiffened with whalebone and a restrictive, tight cover that flattened and jammed her breasts together. The point of a corset was to cinch the waist in as tightly as possible, holding a woman&#x27;s torso erect. It would have been difficult to feel comfortable dressed in such a confining garment. Mary had worn that same dress at her debut to society a few weeks earlier. It was a sheer evening gown with a plunging neckline to display the cleavage. However, in this case the corset cover, a &quot;boxlike armour of whalebone and pink cordage,&quot; poked out from under the gown, so she called her personal maid. She told her, &quot;Bring me two of my pocket handkerchiefs and some pink ribbon ... And bring the needle and thread and some pins.&quot; She fashioned the handkerchiefs and ribbon into a simple bra.

Mary&#x27;s devised undergarment complemented the new fashions of the time. She was mobbed after the dance by other girls who wanted to know how she moved so freely, and when she showed the garment to friends the next day, they all wanted one. One day, she received a request for one of her contraptions from a stranger, who offered a dollar for her efforts. She knew then that this could become a viable business.

=== Patent granted ===
Crosby filed for a patent for her invention on February 12, 1914, and in November that year the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted her a patent for the &#x27;Backless Brassiere&#x27;. Crosby likened her design to earlier covers over the bosom when a woman wore a low corset. Her design had shoulder straps to attach to the garment&#x27;s upper and lower corners, and wrap-around laces for the lower corners which tied at the woman&#x27;s front, enabling her to wear gowns cut low in the back. Crosby wrote that her invention was &quot;well-adapted to women of different size&quot; and was &quot;so efficient that it may be worn by persons engaged in violent exercise like tennis.&quot; Her design was lightweight, soft, and comfortable to wear. It naturally separated the breasts, unlike the corset, which was heavy, stiff, and uncomfortable, and had the effect of creating a single &quot;monobosom&quot; effect.

While Crosby&#x27;s design was the first granted a patent within its category, The U.S. Patent Office and foreign patent offices had issued patents for various bra-like undergarments as early as the 1860s. Other brassiere designs had previously been invented and popularized for use within the United States since about 1910. By 1912, American mass-market brassiere manufacturers included Bien Jolie Brassieres and DeBevoise Brassieres. The latter first advertised its bust supporter in &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1904.

Leading European couturier Lucile actively endorsed bras, and both Lucile and Paul Poiret refined and promoted the brassiere, influencing fashionable women to wear their designs, Paris couturier Herminie Cadolle introduced a breast supporter in 1889. His design was a sensation at the Great Exposition of 1900 and became a fast-selling design among wealthy Europeans in the next decade.

=== Business career ===
After she married Richard Peabody, Crosby filed a legal certificate with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on May 19, 1920, declaring that she was a married woman conducting a business using funds that were from her husband&#x27;s bank account. In 1922 she founded the Fashion Form Brassière Company, locating her manufacturing shop on Washington Street in Boston, where she opened a two-woman sweatshop to manufacture her wireless brassières. The location also became a convenient place for romantic trysts with Harry Crosby, who would become her second husband.

In her later autobiography, &quot;The Passionate Years,&quot; she maintained that she had &quot;a few hundred (units) of her design produced.&quot; She managed to secure a few orders from department stores, but her business never took off. Harry, who had a distaste for conventional business and a generous trust fund, discouraged her from pursuing the business and persuaded her to close it. She later sold the brassiere patent to The Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut, for US$1,500 (roughly equivalent to $ in current dollars). Warner manufactured the &quot;Crosby&quot; bra for a while, but it was not a popular style and was eventually discontinued. However, Warner would go on to earn more than US$15 million from the bra patent over the next thirty years.

In her later years, Crosby wrote, &quot;I can&#x27;t say the brassiere will ever take as great a place in history as the steamboat, but I did invent it.&quot;

== Marriages and family life ==
In 1915, Polly Jacob and Richard (&quot;Dick&quot;) Peabody were married by his grandfather, Endicott Peabody, the founder of the Groton School, and whose family had been one of the wealthiest in America during the 19th century. By the early 20th century, a case could be made that the Peabodies had supplanted the Cabots and the Lodges as the most distinguished name in the region.

Crosby found Peabody&#x27;s temperament to be far from her own. When they had a son, William Jacob, on February 4, 1916, she noted that &quot;Dick was not the most indulgent of parents and like his father before him, he forbade the gurgles and cries of infancy; when they occurred he walked out, and often walked back unsteadily.&quot;

Crosby concluded that Peabody was a well-educated but undirected man, and a reluctant father. Less than a year later, he enlisted at the Mexican border and joined the Boston militia engaged in stopping Pancho Villa&#x27;s cross-border raids. Less than a year after he returned home from that adventure, he enlisted to fight in World War I. Their second child, a daughter, Polleen Wheatland (&quot;Polly&quot;), was born on August 12, 1917, but Peabody was already in Officers Training Camp at Plattsburgh, New York, where he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Artillery. He became a Captain in the United States Army&#x27;s 15th Field Artillery, 2nd Division, American Expeditionary Force. Baby Polly was largely cared for by Peabody&#x27;s parents, but Crosby recalled that &quot;My father-in-law was a stickler for polish, both of manners and minerals.&quot; Crosby&#x27;s mother-in-law wore &quot;nun-like dresses and in bed or out wore starched cuffs as sever as piping.&quot; Peabody, meanwhile, was enjoying life at the front as a bachelor.

Peabody returned home in early 1921 and was assigned to Columbia, South Carolina. Crosby and the children soon joined him, but when the war ended, Peabody found himself left with nothing but a family allowance. He suffered from his war experiences and returned to heavy drinking. Crosby found he had only three real interests, all acquired at Harvard: to play, to drink, and to turn out, at any hour, to chase after fire engines and watch buildings burn. Crosby&#x27;s life was difficult during the war years, and when her husband returned home, significantly changed, her life soon changed abruptly, too.

=== Relationship with Harry Crosby ===

The catalyst for Polly Jacob Peabody&#x27;s transformation was her introduction and eventual marriage to Harry Crosby, a wealthy scion of a socially prominent Boston family, and another veteran and victim of the recent war. Harry attended private schools and until age 19 appeared to be well on the path to a comfortable life as a member of the upper middle class. His experiences in World War I changed everything.

In the pattern of other sons of the elite from New England, he was a volunteer in the American Field Service Ambulance Corps, along with Archibald MacLeish and Ernest Hemingway. On November 22, 1917, the ambulance he was driving was destroyed by artillery fire, but he emerged miraculously unhurt. His best friend, &quot;Spud&quot; Spaulding, was seriously wounded in the explosion, and Harry saved his life. The experience profoundly shaped Harry&#x27;s future. He was at the Second Battle of Verdun. After the battle, his section (the 29th Infantry Division, attached to the 120th French Division) was cited for bravery, and in 1919 Crosby was one of the youngest Americans awarded the Croix de Guerre. Crosby wrote in his journal, &quot;Most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it&#x27;s too late that the only things one never regrets are one&#x27;s mistakes.&quot; He vowed that he would live life on his own terms.

After returning from World War I and while completing his degree at Harvard, Harry met Polly on July 4, 1920, at an Independence Day picnic. Polly&#x27;s husband Richard was in a sanitarium drying out from another drunken spell. Sensing Polly&#x27;s isolation, Harry&#x27;s mother Henrietta Crosby had invited Polly to chaperone Harry and some of his friends to a party, including dinner and a trip to the amusement park at Nantasket Beach. Polly was 28, married, with two small children. Harry was 22, of slight build, with an unusual blonde hair style, a pale complexion, a weak constitution, a consuming gaze and enormous charisma. During dinner, Harry never spoke to the girl on his left, breaking decorum. By some accounts, Harry fell in love with the buxom Mrs. Peabody in about two hours. He confessed his love for her in the Tunnel of Love at the amusement park. Crosby pressed her to see him alone, an unthinkable proposition for a member of Boston&#x27;s upper class. She later wrote, &quot;Harry was utterly ruthless ... to know Harry was a devastating experience.&quot; On July 20, they spent the night together and had sex, and two days later Polly accompanied Harry to New York. He had planned a trip to France to tour battle sites. They spent the night together in New York at the Belmont Hotel. Polly said of the night, &quot;For the first time in my life, I knew myself to be a person.&quot;

Polly was seen by her social circle as someone who had betrayed the trust placed in her as a chaperone, and as an older woman who had taken advantage of a younger man. To the Crosbys, she was dishonorable and corrupt. Polly and Harry&#x27;s scandalous courtship was the gossip of blue-blood Boston.

In the fall, Polly&#x27;s husband Dick Peabody moved back home. His parents supplied a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, and the two children moved into a three-story tenement building. Meanwhile, Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent crates of flowers from his mother&#x27;s garden to Polly&#x27;s apartment and brought over toys for the children. They drove to the beach together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department, and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire alarm bell to his home, so he could turn out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.

Crosby pursued Polly, and in May 1921, when she would not respond to his ardor, Crosby threatened suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly&#x27;s husband was in and out of sanitariums several times, fighting alcoholism. Crosby pestered Polly to tell her husband of their affair and to divorce him. In May, she revealed her adultery to Dick and suggested a separation, and he offered no resistance. Polly&#x27;s mother insisted that she stop seeing Crosby for six months to avoid complete rejection by her society peers, a condition she agreed to, and she left Boston for New York. Divorce was &quot;unheard of ... even among Boston Episcopalians.&quot; Peabody&#x27;s parents were outraged at her affair with Crosby, and that she would ask for a divorce. Dick&#x27;s father Jacob Peabody even visited Harry&#x27;s father, Stephen Crosby, on January 4, 1922, to discuss the situation, but Harry&#x27;s father would not meet with him, for despite his disapproval of Harry&#x27;s irregular behavior, he loved his son. Stephen Crosby at first attempted to dissuade Harry from marrying Polly, and even bought him the Stutz motor car he had been asking for, but Harry would not be persuaded to change his mind. For her part, Polly&#x27;s former friends pilloried her as an adulteress, leaving Polly stunned by the quick turn-about in their attitudes toward her. Polly later described Harry&#x27;s character as: &quot;He seemed to be more expression and mood, than man,&quot; she wrote, &quot;yet he was the most vivid personality I&#x27;ve ever known, electric with rebellion.

=== Divorce from Richard Peabody ===
In June 1921, she formally separated from Dick, and in December he offered to divorce her. In February 1922, Polly and Richard Peabody were legally divorced. Dick subsequently recovered from his alcoholism and published &quot;The Common Sense of Drinking&quot; (1933). He was the first to assert there was no cure for alcoholism. His book became a best seller and was a major influence on Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson. Crosby had been working for eight months at Shawmut National Bank. He went on a six-day drinking spree and resigned. In May 1922, he moved to Paris to work in a job arranged for him by his family at Morgan, Harjes et Cie, the Morgan family&#x27;s bank in Paris. This was fitting, for Crosby, after all, was the nephew of Jessie Morgan, the wife of American capitalist J. P. Morgan, Jr., but it was also awkward because he was both Richard Peabody&#x27;s and Harry Crosby&#x27;s godfather.

Polly had previously traveled to England to visit her cousins, so Crosby visited her there. From May through July, 1922 they lived together in Paris. In July, Polly returned to the U.S. In September, Harry proposed to Polly via transatlantic cable, and the next day he bribed his way aboard the RMS &quot;Aquitania&quot; bound for New York.

=== Move to Paris ===
 On September 9, 1922, Harry reached New York aboard the &quot;Aquitania&quot;. Polly met him at the customs barrier, and they were married in the Municipal Building in New York City that afternoon. Two days later, they re-boarded the &quot;Aquitania&quot; and moved with her children to Paris, France. Harry continued his work in Paris at Morgan, Harjes &amp; Co.

Polly&#x27;s bubble in Paris burst when she learned shortly after their arrival that Harry had been flirting with a girl from Boston. It was the first of many flirtations and affairs that Polly would learn to live with. In early 1923, Polly introduced Harry to her friend Constance Crowninshield Coolidge. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance did not care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. She and Harry soon began a sexual relationship.

In the fall of 1923, Polly could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance that he could not meet Polly&#x27;s demand that he &quot;love her more than anyone in the world. This is absolutely impossible.&quot; But Harry also would not leave Polly, nor did Constance ask him to. But when Constance received a letter from Polly, who confessed that Constance&#x27;s affair with her husband had made her &quot;very miserable,&quot; Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. &quot;Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received. ... I wouldn&#x27;t leave her under any circumstances nor as you say would you ever marry me.&quot; But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924, Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted five years. Polly appeared at least outwardly to tolerate Harry&#x27;s dallying unconventional behavior, and she soon had her own courtiers. In her journals, she privately worried about whether Harry would remain loyal to her.

Their glamorous and luxurious lifestyle soon included an open marriage, numerous affairs, and plenty of drugs and drinking. At the end of 1924, Harry persuaded Polly to formally change her first name. They briefly considered Clytoris before deciding on Caresse. Harry suggesting that her new name &quot;begin with a C to go with Crosby and it must form a cross with mine.&quot; The two names intersected at right angles at the common &quot;R,&quot; &quot;the Crosby cross.&quot; They later named their second whippet Clytoris, explaining to Caresse&#x27;s young daughter Polleen she was named after a Greek goddess.

In July 1925, Harry had sexual relations with a 14-year-old girl he nicknamed &quot;Nubile,&quot; with a &quot;baby face and large breasts,&quot; whom he saw at Étretat, a town in Normandy. In Morocco, during one of their trips to North Africa, Harry and Caresse together took a 13-year-old dancing girl named Zora to bed with them. Harry also had sex with a boy of unspecified age, his only recorded homosexual dalliance.

In 1927, in the midst of his affair with Constance, Harry and Caresse met the Russian painter Polia Chentoff. Harry asked her to paint Caresse&#x27;s portrait, and he soon fell in love with Polia. In November, Harry wrote to his mother that Polia was &quot;very beautiful and terribly serious about art... she ran away from home when she was thirteen to paint.&quot; He was also said to be in love with his cousin Nina de Polignac.

In June 1928, Harry met Josephine Rotch at the Lido in Venice, while she was shopping for her wedding trousseau, and they began an affair. In her autobiography, Caresse minimized Harry&#x27;s dalliance with Josephine, eliminating a number of references to her. Harry told Caresse that Constance and Josephine wanted to marry him.

=== Expatriate life ===
From their arrival in 1922, the Crosbys led the life of rich expatriates. They were attracted to the bohemian lifestyles of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. They settled into an apartment at 12, Quai d&#x27;Orléans on Île St-Louis, and Caresse donned her red bathing suit and rowed Harry down the river to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank. Harry wore his dark business suit, formal hat, and carried his umbrella and briefcase. Caresse rowed home alone, and in her swim suit her generously endowed chest drew whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She later wrote that she thought the exercise was good for her breasts, and she enjoyed the attention.

Harry enjoyed betting on the horse races. They first smoked opium together in Africa, and when their friend Constance Crowninshield Coolidge knocked on their door late one evening, they jumped at her invitation to join her at Drosso&#x27;s apartment. Invitations to Drosso&#x27;s were restricted to a few regulars and occasional friends, as it was an opium den. At Drosso&#x27;s she found small rooms filled with low couches and decorations evoking a middle-Eastern setting. Caresse made a sensation when she arrived, because she had been ready for bed when Constance knocked, so she quickly put on a dress, but wore nothing underneath. After that introduction, Harry dropped in at Drosso&#x27;s frequently, and it sometimes kept him away from home for days at a time.

After about a year, Harry soon tired of the predictable banker&#x27;s life and quit, fully joining the Lost Generation of expatriate Americans disillusioned by the restrictive atmosphere of 1920s America. They were among about 15,000–40,000 Americans living in Paris. Harry wanted as little to do with Caresse&#x27;s children as possible, so after the first year they shipped her son Billy off to Cheam School in Hampshire, England.

The couple cared little for the future, spent their money recklessly, and never tried to live on a budget. This was in part because they had made a suicide pact, which they planned to carry out on October 31, 1942. On that date the earth would be closer to the sun than it had been in several decades, and they promised to jump out of an airplane together. This was to be followed by cremation, after which heirs would disperse their ashes from another airplane.

Spending freely, Harry bought a silk-buttonhole gardenia tuxedo from an exclusive tailor on rue de la Paix. Caresse bought hats from Jean Patou and dresses from the fashion house Tolstoy&#x27;s. On special occasions she wore an evening suit made of gold fabric, featuring a short skirt tailored by Vionnet, one of the most important Parisian fashion icons. Although perfectly chic by Parisian standards, it was nevertheless unacceptable to her cousins and aunts who lived in the aristocratic neighborhood of Faubourg in Paris.

Caresse and Harry purchased their first race horse in June 1924, and then two more in April 1925. They rented a fashionable apartment at 19, Rue de Lille, and obtained a 20-year lease on a mill outside of Paris on the grounds of the Château d&#x27; Ermenonville, which belonged to their friend Armand de la Rochefoucauld, for 2,200 dollar gold pieces (about $ today). They named it &quot;Le Moulin du Soleil&quot; (&quot;The Mill of the Sun&quot;), and she used a wall as a &quot;guest book&quot; for guests to paint pictures and sign their names.

In the first year there, they made friends with a group of students who attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, located at the end of their street. The students invited Harry and Caresse to their annual Quartre Arts Ball, an invitation the couple embraced with enthusiasm. Harry fashioned a necklace out of four dead pigeons, sported a red loincloth, and brought along a bag of snakes. Caresse wore a sheer garment that only came up to her waist, a huge turquoise wig, and nothing else. They both dyed their skin with red ochre. The students cheered Caresse&#x27;s toplessness, and 10 of them carried her around on their shoulders.

In January 1925 they traveled to North Africa, where they again smoked opium, a habit to which they would return again and again. In 1928, they traveled to Lebanon to visit the Temple of Baalbek.

In 1928, Harry inherited his cousin Walter Berry&#x27;s considerable collection of over 8,000 mostly rare books, a collection he prized but which he also scaled back by giving away hundreds of volumes. He was known to slip rare first editions into the bookstalls that lined the Seine. Caresse took on lovers of her own, including Ortiz Manolo, Lord Lymington, Jacques Porel, Cord Meier, and in May, 1928, the Count Armand de La Rochefoucauld, son of the duke de Doudeauville, president of the Jockey Club. But behind closed doors, Harry applied a double standard, quarreling violently with Caresse about her affairs. Occasionally they were swingers together, as when they met two other couples and drove to the country near Bois de Boulogne, drew the cars into a circle with their headlights on, and changed partners.

=== Affair with Cartier-Bresson ===
In 1929, Harry met Henri Cartier-Bresson at Le Bourget, where Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s air squadron commandant had placed him under house arrest for hunting without a license. Harry persuaded the officer to release Cartier-Bresson into his custody for a few days. The men found they shared an interest in photography, and they spent their time together taking and printing pictures at Harry and Caresse&#x27;s home, Le Moulin du Soleil. Harry later said Cartier-Bresson &quot;looked like a fledgling, shy and frail, and mild as whey.&quot; A friend of Crosby&#x27;s from Texas encouraged Cartier-Bresson to take photography more seriously. Embracing the open sexuality offered by Caresse and Harry, Cartier-Bresson fell into an intense sexual relationship with her. In 1931, two years after Harry&#x27;s suicide, the end of his affair with Caresse Crosby left Cartier-Bresson broken-hearted, and he escaped to Ivory Coast of French colonial Africa.

== Publication of poetry ==
Caresse and Harry published her first book, &quot;Crosses of Gold&quot;, in late 1924. It was a volume of conventional, &quot;unadventurous&quot; poetry centering on themes such as love, beauty, and her husband.

In 1926 they published her second book, &quot;Graven Images,&quot; with Houghton Mifflin in Boston. This was the only time they used another publisher. Harry later wrote that his cousin, Walter Berry, suggested that Houghton Mifflin would publish Caresse&#x27;s poetry because &quot;they have just lost Amy Lowell.&quot; Her work remained relatively conventional, &quot;still rhyming love with dove,&quot; by her own admission. A &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; reviewer said her &quot;poetry sings,&quot; and a &quot;Literary Review&quot; contributor admired her &quot;charming&quot; child poems and French flavor. But a critic in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;[f]or all its enthusiasm there is no impact to thought or phrase, the emotion is meager, the imagination bridled.&quot;

In April 1927 they founded an English-language publishing company that they first named Éditions Narcisse, after their black whippet, Narcisse Noir. They used the press as an avenue to publish their own poetry in small editions of finely-made, hard-bound volumes. Their first effort was Caresse&#x27;s &quot;Painted Shores,&quot; in which she wrote about their relationship, including their reconciliation after one of Harry&#x27;s affairs. Her writing matured somewhat, and the book was more creatively organized than her prior efforts. In 1928 she wrote an epic poem which was published as &quot;The Stranger.&quot; The writing is addressed to the men in her life: her father, husband, and son. In an experimental fashion she explored the various kinds of love she had known. Later that year, &quot;Impossible Melodies&quot; explored similar themes. The Crosbys enjoyed such a positive reception of their initial work and decided to expand the press to serve other authors.

Publishing in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s put the company in the milieu of so many American writers who were living abroad. In 1928, Éditions Narcisse published a limited edition of 300 numbered copies of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe with illustrations by Alastair.

In 1928, Harry and Caresse changed the name of the publishing house to the Black Sun Press, in keeping with Harry&#x27;s fascination with death and the symbolism of the sun. Harry developed a private mythology around the sun as a symbol for both life and death, creation, and destruction. The press rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books. They took exquisite care with the books they published, choosing the finest papers and inks.

They published early works of a number of avant-garde writers before those writers were well-known, including James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Tales Told of Shem and Shaun,&quot; which was later integrated into &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot; They published Kay Boyle&#x27;s first book-length work, &quot;Short Stories,&quot; in 1929, and works by Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Eugene Jolas, D. H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, Ezra Pound, and Laurence Sterne. The Black Sun Press evolved into one of the most important small presses in Paris in the 1920s. In 1929, Caresse and Harry both signed poet Eugene Jolas&#x27; &quot;The Revolution of the Word Proclamation&quot;, which appeared in issue 16/17 of the literary journal &quot;transition.&quot; After Harry died, Caresse continued publishing until 1936, when she left Europe for the United States.

== Harry&#x27;s suicide ==
On July 9, 1928, Harry met 20-year-old Josephine Noyes Rotch, whom he would call the &quot;Youngest Princess of the Sun&quot; and the &quot;Fire Princess.&quot; She was descended from a family that first settled in Provincetown, Cape Cod in 1690. Josephine inspired Harry&#x27;s next collection of poems called &quot;Transit of Venus.&quot; Though she was several years his junior, Harry fell in love with Josephine. In a letter to his mother, dated July 24, 1928, Harry wrote:

Josephine and Harry had an ongoing affair until she married, when their relationship temporarily ended. However, Josephine rekindled the affair, and in late November 1929, Harry and Josephine met and traveled to Detroit, where they checked into an expensive Book-Cadillac Hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Harry Crane. For four days they took meals in their room, smoked opium, and had sex.

On November 29, 1929, the lovers returned to New York, where once again they attempted to end the affair, and Josephine agreed that she would return to Boston and her husband. But two days later, she had delivered a 36-line poem to Harry, who was staying with Caresse at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel. The last line of the poem read &quot;Death is our marriage.&quot; On December 9, Harry Crosby wrote in his journal for the last time: &quot;One is not in love unless one desires to die with one&#x27;s beloved. There is only one happiness it is to love and to be loved.&quot;

Harry was found at 10 that night in bed at Stanley Mortimer&#x27;s studio in the Hotel des Artistes. He had a .25 caliber bullet hole in his right temple. He lay next to Josephine, who had a matching hole in her left temple. They were in an affectionate embrace. Both were dressed, but had bare feet. Harry sported red-painted toenails and tattoos on the bottom of his feet. The coroner said that Josephine died at least two hours before Harry did. There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for days, calling it a murder-suicide or double suicide pact, and unable to decide which was more fitting.

== Later life ==

Harry left Caresse US$100,000 (about $ today) in his will, along with generous bequests to Josephine, Constance, and others. His parents Stephen and Henrietta had the will declared invalid, but reassured Caresse that she would receive US$2000 (approximately $ today) a year until she received money from Walter Berry&#x27;s estate. Upon Caresse Crosby&#x27;s return to Europe, she asked her friend Bill Sykes to bring Polleen from Chamonix. She also welcomed Billy home when another friend brought him from boarding school, and the family and friends spent some time at the Mill. Polleen stayed with her mother for a few months, refusing to return to school. Billy returned to Choam, and in 1931 returned to the U.S. to attend the Lenox School.

Crosby decided to reclaim her birth name, Mary, and thus was known after her husband&#x27;s death as &quot;Mary Caresse Crosby.&quot; She pursued ambitions as an actress that she had had since her 20s, and appeared as a dancer in two short experimental films directed by artist Emlen Etting, &quot;Poem 8&quot; (1932) and &quot;Oramunde&quot; (1933).

Crosby broadened the scope of the Black Sun Press after Harry&#x27;s death. Although the press published few works after 1952, it printed James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1963. Despite the slowdown, it did not officially close until Crosby&#x27;s death in 1970.

=== Continuation of Black Sun Press ===
After Harry&#x27;s suicide, Caresse dedicated herself to the Black Sun Press. She also established, with Jacques Porel, a side venture to publish paperback books when they were not yet popular, which she named Crosby Continental Editions. Ernest Hemingway, a long-time friend, offered her a choice of &quot;The Torrents of Spring&quot; (1926) or &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1926) as a debut volume for her new venture. Caresse picked the former, which was less well-received than &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. She followed Hemingway&#x27;s work with nine more books in 1932, including William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; Kay Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Year Before Last,&quot; Dorothy Parker&#x27;s &quot;Laments for the Living,&quot; and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;Night Flight,&quot; along with works by Paul Eluard, Max Ernst, Alain Fournier, George Grosz, C. G. Jung, and Charles-Louis Philippe. After six months of sales, the books only grossed about US$1200. Crosby was unable to persuade U.S. publishers to distribute her work, as paperbacks were not yet widely engaged, because publishers were not convinced that readers would buy them. She closed the press in 1933.

=== Interracial affair with Canada Lee ===
In 1934, she began a love affair with the black actor-boxer Canada Lee, despite living under the threat of miscegenation laws. They had lunch uptown in Harlem at the then-new restaurant &quot;Franks,&quot; where they could maintain their secret relationship. By the 1940s, Lee was a Broadway star and featured in the nationwide run of the play &quot;Native Son.&quot; But the only establishment in Washington, D.C. where they could eat together was an African restaurant named the &quot;Bugazi.&quot; Lee, unlike so many of her lovers, did not ask for money, even when his nightclub &quot;The Chicken Coop&quot; had a difficult time. When, during a dinner in the early 1940s, Crosby&#x27;s brother Walter expressed his dismay at their relationship, Crosby was so offended that she made little contact with Walter over the next 10 years. Crosby and Lee&#x27;s intimate relationship continued into the mid-1940s and contributed to her worldview. Crosby wrote a never-published play, &quot;The Cage,&quot; transparently based on their relationship.

=== Marriage to Bert Saffold Young ===
While taking her daughter Polly to Hollywood, where the latter aspired to become an actor, Crosby met Selbert &quot;Bert&quot; Saffold Young (1910-1971), an unemployed aspiring actor and former football player 18 years her junior. When he saw her staring at him in a restaurant, he immediately came over and asked her to dance. She described him as &quot;handsome as Hermes&quot; and &quot;as militant as Mars.&quot; Her friend Constance described Bert as &quot;untamed&quot; and &quot;entirely ruled by impulse.&quot;

Without a job, he convinced Crosby he just wanted to own a farm, and they decided to look for land on the East Coast. They drove through Virginia, looking for an old plantation house smothered in roses. When their car broke down, she accidentally discovered Hampton Manor, a Hereford cattle farm with a dilapidated brick mansion on a estate in Bowling Green, Virginia. It had been built in 1838 by John Hampton DeJarnette from plans by his friend, Thomas Jefferson. John Hampton was the brother of Virginia Legislator Daniel Coleman DeJarnette, Sr.

On September 30, 1936, she wrote to the New York Trust Company and instructed them to send 433 shares of stock that she used to buy the property, which was in need of renovation. Crosby and Young were married in Virginia on March 24, 1937. There were problems, however. He was always asking her for money, he crashed her car, he ran up the telephone bill, and he used all her credit at the local liquor store. Bert ended one bout of drinking with a solo trip to Florida, and he did not come back to Virginia until the next year.

=== A ghostwriter of erotica ===
In Paris during 1933, Crosby had met Henry Miller. When he returned to the U.S. in 1940, Miller confessed to Crosby his lack of success in getting his work published. Miller&#x27;s autobiographical book &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; was banned in the U.S. as pornographic, and he could get no other work published. She invited him to take a room in her spacious New York apartment on East 54th Street, where she infrequently lived. He accepted, although she did not provide him with money.

Desperate for cash, Miller fell to churning out erotica on commission for an Oklahoma oil baron at a dollar per page, but after two 100-page stories that brought him US$200, he felt he could do no more. Now he wanted to tour the United States by car and write about it. He got a US$750 advance and persuaded the oil man&#x27;s agent to advance him another $200. He was preparing to leave on the trip but still had not provided the work promised. He thought then of Crosby. She was already pitching ideas and pieces of writing to Anaïs Nin&#x27;s New York City smut club for fun, but not for money. In her journal, Nin wrote, &quot;Harvey Breit, Robert Duncan, George Barker, Caresse Crosby, all of us concentrating our skills in a tour de force, supplying the old man with such an abundance of perverse felicities, that now he begged for more.&quot; Crosby was facile and clever, writing easily and quickly with little effort.

Crosby accepted Miller&#x27;s proposal. She wrote at the top the title given her by Henry Miller, &quot;Opus Pistorum&quot; (later republished as Miller&#x27;s work as &quot;Under the Roofs of Paris&quot;), and started right in. Miller left for his car tour of America. Crosby churned out 200 pages, and the collector&#x27;s agent asked for more. Crosby&#x27;s smut was just what the oil man wanted, according to his New York agent. No literary aspirations, just plain sex. In her journal, Nin wrote, &quot;&#x27;Less poetry,&#x27; said the voice over the telephone. &#x27;Be specific.&#x27;&quot; In Crosby the agent had found himself a more basic and pornographic version of Henry Miller.

While Crosby&#x27;s husband fell into a drunken stupor every night, she spent some of her time churning out another 200 pages of pornography. In her diary, Nin observed that everyone who wrote pornography with her wrote out of a self that was opposite to his or her identity, but identical with his or her desire. Crosby had grown up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She maintained a doomed and troublesome romanticism about Harry Crosby, nurtured or inflamed by having participated in a decade or more of taking both intellectual and physical lovers in Paris during the 1920s.

=== Political and artistic activity ===
Although Young was often drunk and infrequently home, Crosby did not lack for company. She extended an invitation to Salvador Dalí and his wife Gala, who became long-term guests, during which he wrote much of his autobiography. In 1934, Dalí and his wife attended a masquerade party in New York, hosted for them by Crosby. Other visitors included Max Ernst, Buckminster Fuller, Stuart Kaiser, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Ezra Pound, and other friends from her time in Paris. She had a brief affair with Fuller during this time. By 1941, having finally divorced Young, Crosby moved to live in Washington, D.C. full-time, where she owned a home at 2008 Q Street NW from 1937 to 1950, and she opened the Caresse Crosby Modern Art Gallery, what was then the city&#x27;s only modern art gallery, at 1606 Twentieth Street, near Dupont Circle. Crosby planned to open the “World Gallery of Art” at Delphi in Greece to establish a capital for her peace organization, Citizens of the World. She was already a collector of American artist Joseph Glasco’s works and she approached Glasco’s art dealer Catherine Viviano to include fourteen works by Glasco with 100 other drawings by Miro, Picasso, Calder, and others. The plan was never realized and the fate of the drawings is not known.

In December, 1943, she wrote Henry Miller to ask if he had heard about her gallery, and if he would be interested in exhibiting some of his paintings there. In 1944, she spent some time with him at his home in Big Sur and later opened his first one-man art show at her gallery.

=== Publication of &quot;Portfolio&quot;===
With the Black Sun Press she also published &quot;,&quot; in which she continued her work with young and avant-garde writers and artists. She printed issues 1, 3, and 5 in the U.S. The second issue was published in Paris in December 1945, less than seven months after the end of World War II. It featured primarily French writers and artists; the fourth issue was published in Rome and focused on Italian writers and artists; and the last issue was focused on Greek artists and writers.

During World War II and for some time afterward, paper was in short supply. Crosby printed the magazine on a variety of different sizes, colors, and types of paper stock printed by different printers, stuffed into a by folder. She printed 1,000 copies of each issue, and as she had done with the Black Sun Press, giving special treatment to 100 or so deluxe copies that featured original artwork by Romare Bearden, Henri Matisse, and others. She secured contributions from a wide variety of well-known artists and writers, including: Louis Aragon, Kay Boyle, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sterling A. Brown, Charles Bukowski, Albert Camus (&quot;Letter to a German Friend,&quot; his first appearance in an English-language publication), Henri Cartier-Bresson,René Char, Paul Éluard, Jean Genet, Natalia Ginzburg, Victor Hugo, Weldon Kees, Robert Lowell, Henri Matisse, Henry Miller, Eugenio Montale, Anaïs Nin, Charles Olson, Pablo Picasso, Francis Ponge, Kenneth Rexroth, Arthur Rimbaud, Yannis Ritsos, Jean-Paul Sartre (&quot;The End of the War&quot;), Karl Shapiro, Stephen Spender, Leo Tolstoy, and Giuseppe Ungaretti. After the sixth issue, she ran out of funds and sponsors. This was her last major publishing effort.

=== Visits to Europe ===
Having left Europe in 1936, she yearned to visit her daughter Polly, who had moved to London and lived there the entire time Crosby was in Washington. Civilian travel was still very restricted after the war ended, and Crosby reached out to her friend Archibald Macleish, now Assistant Secretary of State, who helped her make travel arrangements and obtain a visa. She traveled aboard a military British Overseas Airways Corporation flying boat as the sole civilian passenger, hand-carrying her Elsa Schiaparelli hat box that contained Pietro Lazzari&#x27;s drawings of horses and Romare Bearden&#x27;s &quot;Passion of Christ&quot; watercolor series.

She learned after the war that Nazi troops had set up base in her home, Le Moulin du Soleil. Crosby was most upset when she learned the German troops had painted over the wall that had doubled as her guest book. Mildly ironically, along with painting over the signature of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, who had intertwined his name with that of a Pulitzer Prize-winning American writer, D. H. Lawrence (who drew a phoenix), the Nazis also painted over the signature of Eva Braun, who had signed her name when she visited Harry and Caresse along with an Austrian big-game hunter she was dating at the time.

=== Post-war activity ===
Crosby became politically active again and founded the organizations Women Against War and Citizens of the World, which embraced the concept of a &quot;world community,&quot; something other activists such as Buckminster Fuller also supported. Crosby continued her work to establish a world citizen&#x27;s center in Delphi, Greece, where in 1942 she bought a small house that overlooked the Grove of Apollo. In October 1952 she attempted to visit her property, but she was met by armed guards at Corfu as she got off the ferry from Brindisi. The police placed her under house arrest in the Corfu Palace Hotel, and after three days they told her she was not welcome in Greece and ordered her to leave. The American consul told her that the Greek government thought she was still &quot;considered dangerous to the economy and politics of Greece.&quot; After this plan failed, she created the &quot;World Man Center&quot; in Cyprus, which was to include a geodesic dome designed by Fuller. However this effort, too, came to naught, and she continued to search for a center for her world citizen project.

In 1953, Crosby wrote and published her autobiography, &quot;The Passionate Years.&quot; She crafted it mostly based on her personal recollection rather than a specific set of sources. It contained &quot;many amusing and intense anecdotes ... but precious little about what was going on with him [Harry] is revealed.&quot;

=== Son&#x27;s death ===
In the winter of 1954–55, Crosby&#x27;s son Billy Peabody was in charge of the Paris office for American Overseas Airlines. He and his wife Josette had a small third-floor walk-up apartment on rue du Bac that they heated with a fireplace and a stove. On January 25, 1955, Billy died in his sleep of carbon monoxide poisoning, while Josette was found unconscious and was able to be revived. Crosby traveled to Paris for his funeral, yet somehow making time for appearances at colleges where she gave talks about her life and the Black Sun Press.

== Support of artist&#x27;s colony ==

In 1949 during a tour of Italy, she saw a run-down castle, Castello di Rocca Sinibalda, north of Rome. Baldassare Peruzzi designed and built it between 1530 and 1560 for Cardinal Alessandro Cesarini. In the 1950s she rented it, and later paid US$2,600 for the estate. It came with the Papal title of &quot;Principessa&quot; (Princess). She paid to electrify the castle, and thus brought electricity to the neighboring village. She told a reporter that the castle had 320 rooms, or &quot;at least that&#x27;s what the villagers tell me,&quot; and the deed actually did list 180 of them. Many of the rooms had ceilings and the palace was virtually impossible to heat. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t live here if you paid me,&quot; she told a reporter.

The residential portion of the palace contained three main apartments and two courtyards. The walls of the main hall were decorated by frescoes from the 16th century. She used the castle to house various artists, and she held poetry seminars. Henry Miller described Rocca Sinibalda as the &quot;Center for Creative Arts and Humanist Living in the Abruzzi Hills.&quot; Other artists visited for as little as a weekend or up to an entire season.

In 1962, filmmaker Robert Snyder made a 26-minute documentary about Crosby&#x27;s history and her plans for the castle. The short film, &quot;Always Yes, Caresse&quot; took the viewer on a tour of the castle, led by Crosby. At one point in the film, she pulls down her blouse to reveal her ample bosom for the camera. Snyder learned about Crosby&#x27;s writer&#x27;s retreat while he was in Rome filming a documentary on the Sistine Chapel, &quot;The Titan; The Story of Michelangelo.&quot;

For a while Crosby divided her time between Rocca Sinibalda, which in the winter was cold and unlivable, a more practical residence in Rome, Hampton Manor in Bowling Green, Virginia, her home in Washington, D.C., and her sprawling apartment in New York City. In 1953, the publisher Alvin Redman released her autobiography, &quot;The Passionate Years.&quot; She put Rocca Sinibalda up for sale in 1970, shortly before she died.

== Death ==
Suffering from heart disease, she received what was then still-experimental open heart surgery at The Mayo Clinic. She died of complications from pneumonia in Rome, Italy on January 24, 1970, aged 78. &quot;Time&quot; described her as the &quot;literary godmother to the Lost Generation of expatriate writers in Paris.&quot; Anaïs Nin described her as &quot;a pollen carrier, who mixed, stirred, brewed, and concocted friendships.&quot;

She had lived long enough to see many of the aspiring writers she nurtured in the 1920s become well-known and even canonical authors. The bra she invented went through a number of transformations and became a standard undergarment for women all over the world. Her first two husbands and her son Bill preceded her in death. She was survived by her daughter Polleen Peabody de Mun North Drysdale and two granddaughters. Crosby was buried in the Cimetière de l&#x27;Abbaye de Longchamp, in Boulogne, département de la Vendée, Pays de la Loire, France.

== Legacy ==
Most of her papers and manuscripts are held in the Morris Library archives Special Collections Research Center at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, including more than 1600 photographs from her life, along with the papers of her friends James Joyce and Kay Boyle.

In 2004, Fine Line Features optioned Andrea Berloff&#x27;s first screenplay &quot;Harry &amp; Caresse.&quot; Lasse Hallström was initially attached to direct and Leslie Holleran was attached as a producer.

<doc id="521300" wikidata="Q7722126" url="?curid=521300" title="The Chanukah Song">
<text>&quot;The Chanukah Song&quot; is a novelty song written by comedian Adam Sandler with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writers Lewis Morton and Ian Maxtone-Graham and originally performed by Sandler on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s Weekend Update on December 3, 1994. Sandler subsequently performed the song as part of his stand-up act, later updating it with new lyrics. All variations center on the theme of Hanukkah and of religious Jewish children feeling alienated during the Christmas season, and Sandler&#x27;s listing of Jewish celebrities (with both real-life and fictional connections to Judaism) as a way of sympathizing with their situation.

==Part I (1994)==
This version appeared on Sandler&#x27;s 1996 comedy album &quot;What the Hell Happened to Me?&quot;

Persons referenced in &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot;:
*&quot;You&quot; (The hypothetical Jewish listener)
*&quot;Me&quot; (Adam Sandler)
*David Lee Roth
*James Caan
*Kirk Douglas
*Dinah Shore (replaced in some performances with Pauly Shore)
*Jon Bauman (Bowzer from Sha Na Na)
*Arthur Fonzarelli (who within the context of &quot;Happy Days&quot; was one-quarter Jewish through his maternal grandmother). Henry Winkler, who played Fonzarelli and is himself Jewish, was deeply flattered by the inclusion and began a long collaboration with Sandler afterward.
*Paul Newman (Jewish father)
*Goldie Hawn (Jewish mother)
*Captain Kirk (William Shatner)
*Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy)
*&quot;The owner of the Seattle SuperSonic-ahs&quot; (founding partners Sam Schulman and Gene Klein, both Jewish, had sold the team to non-Jewish Barry Ackerley in 1985, nine years before the song was written. According to Sandler, Sonics owner Ackerley told him to &quot;86 that song&quot; because he didn&#x27;t want to be called Jewish. The situation would correct itself when Ackerley sold the team to Howard Schultz, who is Jewish, in 2001.)
*O. J. Simpson was declared as &quot;not a Jew!&quot; to great applause from the audience.
*Rod Carew (Sandler erroneously claims &quot;he converted;&quot; Carew&#x27;s wife and children are Jewish but he did not convert to the religion. Carew later contacted Sandler and said he found the song rather funny.)
*Ann Landers (Eppie Lederer)
*&quot;Dear Abby&quot; (Pauline Phillips at the time)
*Harrison Ford (Sandler understated Ford&#x27;s Jewish ancestry by saying he is a quarter Jewish; Ford&#x27;s mother was Jewish).
*Ebenezer Scrooge (Sandler says that &quot;some people think&quot; Scrooge is Jewish, but insists that he is not).
*All of The Three Stooges (brothers Moe, Shemp and Curly Howard, Larry Fine, and Joe Besser; Joe DeRita wasn&#x27;t Jewish)
*Tom Cruise, a Scientologist, is mentioned in the song as not Jewish (Sandler jokes during the song that he “hear(s) his agent is” Jewish; Cruise&#x27;s agent at the time of this song&#x27;s release was Kevin Huvane who is not Jewish and would later be an ordained minister).

Sandler also makes reference to the Carnegie Deli, a famed Jewish restaurant in New York City (closed in 2016), and mentions that &quot;you don&#x27;t need&quot; two Christmas songs: &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; and &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;.

During the final verse, performed originally on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and on a radio cut, Sandler sings the line &quot;Drink your gin and tonic-ah, but don&#x27;t smoke marijuan-icah&quot;. On the uncut album version, and during various concert appearances, the line was changed to &quot;Drink your gin and tonic-ah, and smoke your marijuan-icah&quot;. The uncut version, despite the reference to marijuana, receives most radio airplay today; another radio edit skips completely over the gin and tonic/marijuana line altogether.

==Part II (1999)==
&quot;The Chanukah Song, Part II&quot; was recorded live at Brandeis University for Sandler&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Stan and Judy&#x27;s Kid&quot;.

Persons referenced in &quot;The Chanukah Song, Part II&quot;:
*&quot;You&quot; (the hypothetical Jewish listener)
*&quot;Me&quot; (Adam Sandler)
*Winona Ryder (whose father is Jewish)
*Ralph Lauren
*Calvin Klein
*Louise Post and Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt
*Michael &quot;Mike D&quot; Diamond, Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch, and Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz of the Beastie Boys (Diamond is Jewish, Yauch was raised Jewish and later converted to Buddhism, and Horovitz&#x27;s father was Jewish)
*Lenny Kravitz (father Sy Kravitz was a non-practicing Jew; Lenny converted to Christianity in his youth)
*Courtney Love (Sandler incorrectly says Love is half-Jewish; neither of her parents were Jewish).
*Harvey Keitel
*Jennifer Beals (an error; Beals says she once wanted to be Jewish, but is not).
*Yasmine Bleeth (her father Phil was Jewish)
*Dustin Hoffman (referred to as &quot;Dustin Hoffmanica&quot; for the sake of rhyme)
*O. J. Simpson, &quot;still not a Jew&quot;
*Scooby-Doo (voiced by Hadley Kay at the time; Kay had recently replaced Don Messick, who had originated the role from 1969 to 1996 but was not himself Jewish) 
*Bob Dylan, &quot;was born a Jew, then he wasn&#x27;t, but now he&#x27;s back&quot; (The accuracy of this line is questionable; as late as 2009, Dylan reportedly still identified as a Christian, although he had also been seen in synagogues during High Holy Days around this same time period.)
*Robert Levine, husband of Mary Tyler Moore
*Tiger Woods (Mentioned, but not identified as Jewish. &quot;No, I&#x27;m not talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Tiger Woods&quot;.)
*Happy Gilmore, character played by Sandler in the 1996 film of the same name
*Bruce Springsteen, who &quot;isn&#x27;t Jewish&quot;, but &quot;my [Sandler&#x27;s] mother thinks he is&quot;.
*Daryle Lamonica, who was not claimed as Jewish but was included simply because his name rhymed with Hanukkah

Other pop culture references include: Manischewitz wine, Hooked on Phonics, and Tijuana, Mexico.

==Part III (2002)==
Included on the &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; soundtrack featuring vocals from actor Rob Schneider and the children&#x27;s choir The Drei-Dels.

Persons referenced in &quot;The Chanukah Song, Part III&quot;:
*Ross (David Schwimmer) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) from &quot;Friends&quot;
*David Lander (Squiggy) of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;
*Debra Messing
*Melissa Gilbert (was adopted by a Jewish mother and raised in her religion)
*Michael Landon (Landon, whose father was Jewish, grew up practicing Conservative Judaism and is buried in a Jewish cemetery.)
*Jerry Lewis
*Ben Stiller (Stiller&#x27;s father Jerry Stiller was Jewish, and mother Anne Meara, who was of Irish Catholic background, converted to Judaism).
*Jack Black (his father converted to Judaism, his mother was born Jewish.)
*Tom Arnold (&quot;converted to Judaism, but you guys can have him back! Just kidding”)
*Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider—see note below)
*Mickey Raphael (referenced by Schneider as &quot;The guy in Willie Nelson&#x27;s band who plays harmonica&quot;)
*Osama bin Laden, who is &quot;not a big fan of the Jews&quot;.
*Sarah Hughes (half-Jewish; &quot;her mama&#x27;s Jewish&quot;)
*Harry Houdini
*David Blaine (his mother was Jewish)
*Gwyneth Paltrow (Jewish father)
*Jennifer Connelly (Jewish mother)
*Lou Reed
*Perry Farrell
*Beck (maternal grandmother was Jewish)
*Paula Abdul
*Joey Ramone
*Natalie Portman (as &quot;Natalie Portmanika&quot;)

Also, in an unedited version that Sandler sings at some of his comedy shows, he replaces the lyric &quot;As for half-Jewish actors/Sean Penn is quite the great one/And Marlon Brando&#x27;s not a Jew at all/But it looks to me like he ate one&quot; with &quot;Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s half-Jewish/But a full-time Oscar winner/Jennifer Connelly&#x27;s half-Jewish, too/And I&#x27;d like to put some more in her&quot;. While this version is not played on radio stations, the music video shows a background screen showing a picture of Sandler licking his lips as the Jennifer Connelly lyric is sung, with shocked laughter coming from the audience. This version is hidden about four minutes after the edited version on the &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; soundtrack.

Although Sandler does not actually mention Schneider by name as part of the song, he mentions Deuce Bigalow, a character played by Schneider, in the lyric, &quot;but we can do it all night long, with Deuce Bigalow&quot; (the &quot;you can do it&quot; line is also a reference to Schneider&#x27;s recurring &quot;townie&quot; character that originally appeared in &quot;The Waterboy&quot;). As Sandler mentions Bigelow, Schneider walks on stage, yells, &quot;I&#x27;m Jewish!&quot;, and joins in for an abbreviated chorus. 

Sandler and the Drei-Dels performed this version on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 16, 2002. There, after the chorus, Schneider sings a Jewish reference for the song (Mickey Raphael, see above), using an Elvis-esque vocal tic after which, in the aired version, Sandler ad libs &quot;tiny Elvis, ladies and gentlemen, tiny Elvis!&quot; (a reference to an &#x27;SNL&#x27; skit Schneider performed with Nicolas Cage; and possibly also to Elvis Presley.). In the aired version, Sandler then gives an aside of, &quot;Schneider, I did not even know you were Jewish,&quot; to which Schneider replies, &quot;I&#x27;m a Filipino Jew, in fact, I&#x27;ve gotta run home and light the first pig!&quot; In the rehearsal version, Schneider states, &quot;I&#x27;m a Filipino Jew.&quot; When Sandler muses, &quot;Filipino Jew?&quot; Schneider responds, &quot;There are four of us.&quot; He then puts on a blonde wig and joins the &quot;Drei-dels,&quot; the backing chorus of children, to whom he is already similarly dressed.

==Part IV (2015)==
Sandler first performed this version at a live Judd Apatow &amp; Friends event, part of the New York Comedy Festival, in November 2015. Lyrics can be found at the Huffington Post link here.

==Covers and spoofs==
Jimmy Fallon impersonated Adam Sandler during a &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 24, 1998. In the sketch, Fallon, as Sandler, interrupts Will Ferrell&#x27;s Alex Trebek by playing guitar and singing (to the tune of the song&#x27;s chorus and first few verses), &quot;Robert De Niro, Bela Lugosi, Snuffleupagus, and Parker Posey!&quot; (In keeping with the &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; conceit of all of the responses being wrong, none of those people were Jews; De Niro, Lugosi and Posey were all raised Roman Catholic, and Snuffy puppeteer Jerry Nelson had no publicly known religion.)

In 2004, Jewish-Australian pop-punk band Yidcore covered it as &quot;The Punk Rock Chanukah Song&quot; in which they list Jews involved with punk music.

This song was covered on two different occasions for the Broadway charity albums &quot;Carols for a Cure.&quot; In 2006, the cast of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; sang the first installment of the song, led by Constantine Maroulis, and featuring help from violinist Alicia Svigals. In 2013, the song was covered once again by the cast of &quot;Soul Doctor&quot;, however this time, the lyrics covered Jewish Broadway personalities, including Mandy Patinkin, Andrew Lippa, Harvey Fierstein, Harold Prince and others. These lyrics were written by the show&#x27;s Shlomo actor Eric Anderson, who himself has been pointed out in the song as &quot;not a Jew.&quot;

In the season 3 &quot;The Office&quot; episode &quot;Diwali&quot;, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) parodies Sandler by performing &quot;The Diwali Song&quot; during a Hindu Diwali festival.

In 2008, Unitarian-Universalist Evan Austin performed a parody of this song called &quot;The Chalica Song&quot; about the Unitarian-Universalist holiday of Chalica. Austin lists celebrities and historical persons who are &quot;Unitarian-Universalists. Or Unitarians. Or Universalists. Or people with similar ideas.&quot; In 2009, Austin recorded &quot;The (Second) Chalica Song&quot; with the same tune, but a new list of names.

In 2009, a cover of the song by Neil Diamond was released on &quot;A Cherry Cherry Christmas&quot;. This version featured several changes in lyrics, including the change from &quot;Tom Cruise isn&#x27;t but I heard his agent is&quot; to &quot;Tom Cruise isn&#x27;t, but Jesus Christ is&quot;.

On a 2014 episode of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, Sandler appears in a sketch on how to spell &quot;Chanukah&quot;, singing a brief snippet of the song describing how Angelina Jolie is not a Jew.

In 2021, rock band Haim posted a brief cover on Twitter and Instagram, with lyrics covering Maya Rudolph (Jewish father), Michelle Zauner (referred to by her band Japanese Breakfast), Aaron and Bryce Dessner, Rashida and Kidada Jones (Jewish mother), Eugene and Dan Levy, Doja Cat (Jewish mother), Timothée Chalamet (Jewish mother), and Stephen Sondheim.

<text>The Fairey Fulmar is a British carrier-borne reconnaissance aircraft/fighter aircraft which was developed and manufactured by aircraft company Fairey Aviation. It was named after the northern fulmar, a seabird native to the British Isles. The Fulmar served with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm (FAA) during the Second World War.

The design of the Fulmar was based on that of the earlier Fairey P.4/34, a land-based light bomber developed during 1936 as a replacement for the Fairey Battle light bomber. Fairey had redesigned the aircraft as a navalised observation/fighter aircraft to satisfy the requirements of Specification O.8/38, for which it was selected. Although its performance (like that of its Battle antecedent) was unspectacular, the Fulmar was a reliable, sturdy aircraft with long range and an effective armament of eight machine guns; the type could also be put into production relatively quickly. On 4 January 1940, the first production aircraft made its first flight and delivery commenced shortly thereafter, while production of an improved model, the Fulmar Mk II, started during January 1941. Fairey produced a total of 600 Fulmars at its Stockport factory between January 1940 and December 1942.

During July 1940, No. 806 Squadron became the first FAA squadron to receive the Fulmar. It participated in the pursuit of the , having acted as a spotter for the chasing fleet. The Fulmar was heavily used in the North African Campaign, flying convoy protection patrols to and from the island of Malta, and providing air cover for Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers during attacks such as the Battle of Cape Matapan. By autumn 1940, it had been recorded as having shot down ten Italian bombers and six enemy fighters. The Fulmar was also deployed to the Far East, where it proved largely incapable of matching the Japanese-built Mitsubishi A6M Zero. During the later stages of the conflict, it was relegated from the fighter role by single-seat aircraft such as the British-built Supermarine Seafire and the American-built Grumman Martlet fighters. While continuing service as a trainer and reconnaissance aircraft for a time, the Fulmar was withdrawn from front line service in February 1945.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The Fulmar has its origins in the Fairey P.4/34, which had been developed in response to the issuing of Specification P.4/34 by the British Air Ministry. P.4/34 had sought a light bomber that would be capable of being used as a dive bomber; in addition to Fairey&#x27;s entry, competing submissions came in the form of the Hawker Henley and an unbuilt Gloster design. Despite the P.4/34&#x27;s relatively high maximum speed of 284 mph, the rival Henley, which was capable of attaining 300 mph, was selected and eventually ordered; in service, the Henley was largely used as a target tug.

The Fulmar was basically a version of the P.4/34 which had been adapted for naval use. Fairey submitted their modified design as a response to Specification O.8/38, which called for a two-crew fighter capable of observation and fleet defence operations. As the prospective aircraft was not expected to encounter any major fighter opposition, as Nazi Germany, Britain&#x27;s only foreseen enemy during this era, possessed no aircraft carriers of its own, factors such as long range and heavy armament were considered to be more important than a high level of either manoeuvrability or speed. As the type was intended to routinely perform lengthy flights over the ocean, the presence of a navigator / wireless operator was considered to be an essential element, especially when flying at nighttime or during poor weather conditions.

Possessing a substantial resemblance to the earlier Fairey Battle, the Fulmar prototype was an aerodynamically cleaner aircraft and featured a folding wing that was shorter. On 13 January 1937, the prototype P.4/34 serial number &quot;K5099&quot; conducted its maiden flight at Fairey Aviation&#x27;s Great West Aerodrome (this site has since been occupied by London Heathrow Airport), the Fairey test pilot Chris Staniland was at the controls. Shortly after the initial flight tests, the tail was elevated by . During 1938, the name &quot;Fulmar&quot; was picked for the type, although this was not announced until deliveries of the type commenced during 1940.

===Production and further development===
The first prototype Fulmar, which acted as a &quot;flying mock-up&quot;, was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Merlin III engine, which was capable of generating up to 1,030hp hp (810 kW). Flight testing revealed the prototype&#x27;s performance to be relatively poor, the highest speed it could attain being 230 mph (370 km/h). Following the adoption of the more powerful Merlin VIII engine – a variant unique to the Fulmar and with supercharging optimised for low-level flight, as well as various aerodynamic improvements made to the airframe, the prototype&#x27;s speed was increased to 265 mph (426 km/h) when flown at an altitude of 7500 ft (2286m). Due to the desperate requirement for more modern fighters to equip Britain&#x27;s carrier fleet, the Fulmar&#x27;s performance was considered adequate.
As a relatively straightforward derivative of an existing prototype, the Fulmar promised to be available in quantity quickly; during mid-1938, an initial order for 127 production aircraft was placed by the Royal Navy. Beyond Britain&#x27;s own plans for the type, the Danish Navy also took a keen interest in the Fulmar; at one point, plans were in motion to produce the aircraft under licence in Denmark; however, such ambitions were terminated by the outbreak of the Second World War. Furthermore, while a float plane model of the aircraft was designed and promoted, no such aircraft would ever be constructed. On 4 January 1940, the first production aircraft flew from Fairey&#x27;s facility at RAF Ringway near Manchester; the final of 600 Fulmars was delivered from Ringway on 11 December 1942.
During January 1941, production of the improved Fulmar Mk II commenced; the first Mk II aircraft was delivered to an operational squadron in March 1941. This model of the aircraft was furnished with the more powerful Merlin XXX engine; this engine and 350lb of airframe weight savings allowed the aircraft to achieve 272mph at rated altitude, whilst also allowing sea level rate of climb to increase to 1250 feet per minute(15,000ft being obtainable in 12 mins against 15 mins in the Mk1)the airframe had provision for a 60-gallon (273 litre) centre-line drop tank and provision to carry a 250 lb (114 kg) or 500 lb (227 kg) bomb in lieu of the drop tank. During October 1941, tests performed at RAF Boscombe Down revealed that the 60-gallon drop tank extended the aircraft&#x27;s range to . During June 1942, flight testing of the Fulmar II was conducted at Boscombe Down; these tests found that the Fulmar could safely drop a 500 lb bomb during 60-degree dives at up to 310 knots. Fulmars were launched from catapults on merchant ships, a convoy defensive plan that was being evaluated at the time.

&quot;N1854&quot;, the first production Fulmar, was later modified to Mk II standard and re-designated &quot;G-AIBE&quot;, after which it was used as Fairey&#x27;s hack for some time. During June 1959, it reverted to service markings and was seen at Farnborough at the SBAC show on 8 September 1962; &quot;G-AIBE&quot;&#x27;s last flight was conducted three months later on 18 December 1962. During 1972, the aircraft was presented to the Fleet Air Arm Museum, Yeovilton, where it has been preserved and is on static display.

==Operational history==
During July 1940, the first squadron of the Fleet Air Arm to be equipped with the Fulmar was No. 806 Squadron, this squadron commenced operations from the aircraft carrier shortly afterwards. The Navy had specified a two-seat machine so that the pilot would have the assistance of another crew member in reporting back to the fleet the observations made, which were done using wireless telegraphy (W/T) and to navigate over the ocean. The Fulmar was too large and lacked manoeuvrability against single-seat, land-based opposition, as it did in the Mediterranean Theatre; its performance was clearly inferior to typical land-based fighters. The long range of the Fulmar was often useful at times. During the 1941 chase of , Germany&#x27;s newest capital ship, six Fulmars from the aircraft carrier were used as carrier-borne spotters, playing a marginal role in tracking the movements of the battleship.

The Fulmar was one of several British aircraft to participate in the North African Campaign. During September 1940, the Fulmar first saw action while flying convoy protection patrols to and from the island of Malta. When reinforcements were being dispatched to Malta, Fulmars guided flights of carrier-launched Hurricane and Spitfire fighters. The relatively sturdy Fulmar was able to achieve dozens of victories against its Italian and German adversaries. The first recorded kill by a Fulmar was scored on 2 September 1940. By October of that year, Fulmar pilots had claimed the shooting down of ten Italian bombers. The type proved particularly effective against Italian reconnaissance aircraft. Later on, thirteen Fulmars onboard the aircraft carrier also participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan, strafing the battleship Vittorio Veneto whilst trying to draw fire away from the attacking Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers.

The Fulmar was also deployed in other theatres, including the Eastern Front. The type was a common constituent of the numerous Arctic convoys of World War II. Fulmars also played a prominent role in Operation EF, the ill-fated air raid on Axis-held facilities Kirkenes and Petsamo conducted during July 1941. During early 1942, multiple Fulmar-equipped squadrons were deployed to the Pacific Theatre against the Japanese Empire, while two squadrons were dispatched to defend Ceylon. On engaging with the nimble and lightly armoured Mitsubishi A6M fighter, the Fulmar quickly proved to have been outclassed against the Zero and six Fulmars were lost in exchange for four Aichi D3A &quot;Vals&quot; and one Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot;. Despite this, more Fulmars were dispatched to the Far East.

Throughout 1942, the Fulmar was being gradually replaced as a naval fighter by single-seat aircraft that had been adapted from land fighters, such as the British Hawker Sea Hurricane and Supermarine Seafire, or the American Grumman Martlet, which was designed as a carrier aircraft from the start. The Fulmar was to figure prominently in the Mediterranean during 1941 and 1942 as the primary fighter of the Fleet Air Arm for most of the Malta convoys during those years. 16 Fulmars were present on &quot;Victorious&quot; during the penultimate Operation Pedestal which was to be their last major carrier borne operation. The type continued to be operated, providing useful service as a night convoy escort and intruder, it was also used to train crews for the newer and more advanced Fairey Barracuda. Following their withdrawal from the fighter role, Fulmars were used for long-range reconnaissance missions. Unarmed Fulmars would also see service in Africa as communications and despatch aircraft.

At its peak, twenty squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm were equipped with the Fulmar. It flew from eight fleet aircraft carriers and five escort carriers. No. 273 Squadron RAF operated them for some months in 1942 from China Bay, Ceylon, seeing action against Japanese forces during the raid on 9 April 1942, though about half the squadron personnel were Navy. Fulmars are recorded as having destroyed 112 enemy aircraft against the loss of 40 Fulmars, which made the type the leading fighter type in terms of aircraft shot down to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm during the war. In February 1945, the Fulmar was withdrawn from front line service; the last operational aircraft, a Fulmar MK II night-fighter from No. 813 Squadron, was severely damaged in a landing accident at the safety barrier on and was written off.

Approximately 100 Fulmars were converted to a night fighter variant but the type achieved only limited success in this role. Some of the early marks of the aircraft were also operated from CAM ships. Vichy French forces reportedly captured a Fulmar Mk I, which had been forced to land while flying a reconnaissance mission over Senegal during March 1941. This Fulmar was repaired and operated for some time by the Group de Chasse I/4.

According to pilots, its flight characteristics were considered to be pleasant, while its widely spaced undercarriage provided good deck handling and it had excellent fuel capacity and range. Most Fleet Air Arm fighter aces scored at least some of their victories while flying Fulmars; the first pilot to score five kills while flying the type was Sub-Lieutenant Jackie Sewell. Sub-Lieutenant Stanley Orr finished the war with twelve confirmed air victories, the third-highest scoring pilot in the FAA.

<doc id="521306" wikidata="Q1896262" url="?curid=521306" title="Chilean wine">
<text>Chile has a long history in the production of wine, with roots dating back to the 16th century when the Spanish conquistadors introduced &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; vines to the region. In the mid-19th century, French wine varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carmenère, and Cabernet Franc were introduced. During the early 1980s, the Chilean wine industry underwent a renaissance with the introduction of stainless steel fermentation tanks and the use of oak barrels for aging. This led to a rapid growth in exports as quality wine production increased. The number of wineries in Chile rose from 12 in 1995 to over 70 in 2005.

The late 20th century saw a large number of French immigrants settling in Chile, bringing with them extensive viticultural knowledge. Today, Chile stands as the fifth largest exporter of wine globally and the seventh largest producer. The climate in Chile has been described as a fusion of the climates in California and France. The most commonly grown grape variety in the country are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carmenère. Chile is also fortunate to remain free of the phylloxera louse, which means that its grapevines do not require grafting with phylloxera-resistant rootstocks.

==History==

The introduction of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; vines to Chile dates back to the 16th century, when Spanish conquistadors and missionaries brought the European vines to the region in 1554. According to local legend, the first vines were planted by conquistador Francisco de Aguirre himself. The vines may have originated from established Spanish vineyards in Peru and likely included the &quot;common black grape&quot;, which Hernán Cortés brought to Mexico in 1520. This grape variety became the ancestor of the widely planted Pais grape, which was the most widely planted Chilean grape until the 21st century. Jesuit priests were responsible for cultivating these early vineyards and used the wine produced for the celebration of the Eucharist. By the late 16th century, Chilean historian Alonso de Ovalle noted widespread plantings of &quot;the common black grape&quot;, as well as Muscatel, Torontel, Albilho, and Mollar.

During the Spanish rule, the production of vineyards was limited, with the requirement that Chileans purchase the majority of their wines directly from Spain. However, in 1641, the importation of wine from Chile and the Viceroyalty of Peru into Spain was banned, which greatly impacted the wine industry in the colony. The ban led to a surplus of grapes that were instead made into pisco and aguardiente, causing wine production in Peru to nearly disappear.
Despite these restrictions, Chileans preferred their domestic production over the oxidized and vinegary wines imported from Spain, which did not fare well during the long voyage. They even went as far as to export some of their wines to neighboring Peru, with one such shipment being seized by the English privateer Francis Drake at sea. Instead of being angry at Drake, Spain sent an indictment to Chile ordering to majority of their vineyards to be destroyed, but this order was largely ignored.

In the 18th century, Chile was recognized for its sweet wines made from the Pais and Muscatel grapes. To increase their sweetness, the wines were often boiled, which concentrated the grape juice. After his shipwreck off the coast at Cape Horn, Admiral John Byron, grandfather of the famous poet Lord Byron, traveled across Chile and brought back to England a positive review of Chilean Muscatel, comparing it favorably to Madeira. However, wine writer André Jullien in the 19th century was less impressed and compared Chilean wines to a &quot;potion of rhubarb and senna.&quot;

Despite its political ties to Spain, Chile&#x27;s wine history was heavily influenced by French, specifically Bordeaux, winemaking. Before the phylloxera epidemic, wealthy Chilean landowners were inspired by their visits to France and started importing French vines. Don Silvestre Errázuriz was the first to do so, bringing in varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet franc, Malbec, Sauvignon blanc, and Sémillon, and hired a French oenologist to manage his vineyard and produce Bordeaux-style wines. He saw the potential in Chile and even tried growing the German wine grape Riesling. Similar to the Rioja wine region, the arrival of phylloxera in France became a positive opportunity for the Chilean wine industry. With vineyards in ruins, many French winemakers traveled to South America, bringing their experience and techniques with them. As a result, Don Silvestre Ochagavía Echazarreta founded Ochagavia Wines in 1851 and Don Maximiano Errázuriz established Viña Errázuriz in 1870, both using grapes imported from France.

===20th century===
Chile&#x27;s export of wines to Argentina was hindered by the lack of efficient land transportation and several fears of war. The situation improved after the signing of the Pactos de Mayo in 1902 and the opening of the Transandine Railway in 1909, which made war unlikely and facilitated trade across the Andes. The two governments agreed to establish a free trade agreement. However, the Argentine winegrowers&#x27; association, &quot;Centro Vitivinícola Nacional&quot;, which was dominated by European immigrants, vehemently protested against the free trade agreement as they perceived Chilean wines as a threat to the local industry. This, combined with the objections of the cattle farmers in Chile, ultimately led to the scrapping of the free trade agreement plans.

In the 20th century, political instability, coupled with restrictive regulations and high taxes, hindered the growth of Chile&#x27;s wine industry. Until the 1980s, the majority of Chilean wine was considered low quality and mostly consumed domestically. As recognition of Chile&#x27;s favorable wine growing conditions increased, so did foreign investment in Chilean wineries. This period saw significant technological advancements in winemaking, and Chile established a reputation for producing high-quality wines at reasonable prices. Chile&#x27;s export increased, becoming the third largest exporter, after France and Italy, to the United States by the turn of the 21st century. However, it has since dropped to fourth in the US, being overtaken by Australia. The focus has now switched to developing exports in other major wine markets such as the United Kingdom and Japan.

==Climate and geography==
Chile is a long, narrow country that is geographically and climatically dominated by the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Chile&#x27;s vineyards are found along an 800-mile stretch of land from Atacama Region to the Bio-Bio Region in the south. The climate is varied with the northern regions being very hot and dry compared to the cooler, wetter regions in the south. In the Valle Central around Santiago, the climate is dry with an average of 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain and little risk of springtime frost. The proximity to the Dry Andes help create a wide diurnal temperature variation between day and nighttime temperatures. This cool drop in temperature is vital in maintaining the grapes&#x27; acidity levels.

Most of Chile&#x27;s premium wine regions are dependent on irrigation to sustain vineyards, getting the necessary water from melting snow caps in the Andes. In the developing wine regions along the Coastal Ranges and in the far south, there is not a lack in needed rainfall but vineyard owners have to deal with other factors such as the Humboldt Current from the Pacific which can bathe a vineyard with a blanket of cool air. For the rest of Chile&#x27;s wine regions, the Coastal Ranges serve a buffer from the current and also acts as a rain shadow. The vineyards in these regions are planted on the valley plains of the Andes foothills along a major river such as the Maipo, Rapel and Maule Rivers.

The vineyards of Chile fall between the latitudes of 32 and 38° s which, in the Northern Hemisphere would be the equivalent of southern Spain and North Africa. However the climate in Chile&#x27;s wine regions is much more temperate than those regions, comparing more closely to California and Bordeaux. Overall, it is classified as a Mediterranean climate with average summer temperatures of and potential highs of .

==Wine regions==

Since December 1994, the Chilean wine-producing regions have been officially defined as follows, to help identify the different features of wines produced in different parts of Chile&#x27;s variable geography. The Chilean ministry of agriculture redefined in a decree of May 2018 the zonal winegrowing structure:

===Atacama Region===
Named after the Atacama Region administrative territory, this region is divided into two valleys, Copiapó and Huasco, both of which are coterminous with the provinces of the same names. The region is known primarily for its Pisco and table grapes, but in the 1950s wine began to be produced on a small scale around Copiapó. Examples of wine from these valleys include &quot;Vino Copiapino&quot; (literally, &quot;Copiapó&#x27;s Wine&quot;) by Viña Fajardo and Pajarete wine, a varietal from Spain that is now produced successfully in the Huasco Valley.

=== Coquimbo Region ===
The Coquimbo Region contains three wine-producing sub regions: Elqui, Limarí and Choapa, all are coterminous with the provinces of the same name.
*The Elqui Valley is located north of Santiago, at the southern end of the Atacama Desert in the Coquimbo Region. It is known for producing table grapes and other fruits, as well as Pisco, Chile&#x27;s most popular liquor. But it is also notable for being the most commercially viable wine-producing region of northern Chile.
The region&#x27;s vineyards extend from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Andes Mountains in the east, rising to an altitude of 2,000 m.a.s.l. (6,500 feet). Wine production began in the Elqui Valley in the 1990s when Chilean wine producers began to look at potential viticulture sites outside the Chilean Central Valley. Since then, of vines have been planted, mostly along the River Elqui valley, where grape growers have access to high-quality water for irrigation.
The region is characterized by a sunny, desert-like climate, less than of annual rainfall, dry rocky terrain, steep valleys and temperate hills cooled by strong winds from the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains, producing excellent results for varietals like Syrah.
* The Limarí Valley is located roughly north of Santiago, in the Coquimbo region.
Vines were first planted here in the mid-16th century and have seen a recent resurgence, due to new technologies and winemakers seeking new terroirs. The area is best known for producing Sauvignon and Chardonnay, first planted during the 1990s, and also successfully produces Syrah and Pinot noir, with a climate similar to Marlborough in New Zealand.
The Pacific Ocean has a strong influence on the coast of the region with the cooling Camanchaca, a fog that enters the valley from the west each morning and retreats as the sun rises over the Andes from the east. With less than 4 inches of rainfall per year, drip irrigation is used to water the vines that grow in the mineral-rich soil. The combination creates fresh wines with a distinct mineral edge.

* The Choapa Valley lies around north of Santiago, in the southern part of the Coquimbo Region. Like the Atacama, this region is primarily known for Pisco and table grapes.
It lies within the narrowest part of Chile, where the Andes meet the Coastal Range and consists of two sectors, Illapel and Salamanca. There are no wineries in either of these sectors, but vines planted on the rocky, foothill soils produce small quantities of high quality Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes with high acidity and low pH, which is increasing wine producers&#x27; interest in the area.

===Aconcagua Region===

The administrative region of Valparaíso contains two wine-producing subregions, the Aconcagua and Casablanca valleys. The Aconcagua Valley is coterminous with the province of San Felipe de Aconcagua Province while the Casablanca Valley is coterminous with the commune of that name. The Panquehue commune is also gradually developing a reputation for high quality wine production.
* In the Aconcagua Valley, snow melt from Aconcagua and the surrounding mountains is used to irrigate the vines.
The small 1,098 hectare winegrowing area is well known for its red wines, which have earned international acclaim, with Vina Errázuriz&#x27;s &quot;Seña&quot; placing ahead of both Château Lafite and Château Margaux in blind tasting held in Berlin in 2004, a milestone for the Chilean wine industry.
Although the valley is primarily known for the red grapes grown in its interior, white grapes are also now being grown in new coastal plantations.
* The Casablanca Valley takes its name from the commune where it is located, and stretches roughly east-west from eastern border of the Valparaíso province in the Valparaíso region.
Vines were first planted here in the mid-1980s during the revitalization of the Chilean wine industry and the area quickly became known for its white wines, most notably Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay, as well as Pinot noir, which thrives in its cooler climate.
Although the valley is located at 33°S, much closer to the Equator than any European vineyard, viticulture here is possible because of the cooling influence of the Pacific Ocean, in the shape of cool morning fog and greater cloud cover than is found elsewhere in the north of Chile. Free-draining clay and sandy soils, whilst good for viticulture, encourage nematodes, so grafting onto nematode-resistant rootstocks is common.

* San Antonio Valley is a small wine region known for producing Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay.
It is located very close to the sea around the city of San Antonio, Chile, south of the Casablanca Valley and only west of Santiago. As in other Chilean wine regions, like the Casablanca Valley, San Antonio is highly influenced by the cooling effect of the Pacific Ocean which makes wine production possible in this area.
Soils are in the valley are granitic, poor and well drained with a topsoil of clay, providing a good substrate for vines.
Rains are concentrated mainly in the winter season and the vineyards require drip irrigation for the rest of the year, using water from the Maipo river.
The San Antonio Valley is seen as an up-and-coming wine region and the wine industry is expected to continue growing in the future.

===Central Valley Region===
The Central Valley spans the O&#x27;Higgins (VI) and Maule (VII) administrative regions as well as the Metropolitana Region. Within it are four subregions: the Maipo Valley, the Rapel Valley, the Curicó Valley and the Maule Valley. This is Chile&#x27;s most productive and internationally known wine region, due in large part to its proximity to the country&#x27;s capital, Santiago. It is located directly across the Andes from Argentina&#x27;s most well known wine region, Mendoza Province The soil of Maipo Valley is noted for high salinity stemming from irrigation from the Maipo river and low potassium level which has some impact on the grapevines. Vineyards in the Maule also suffer from low potassium as well as deficient nitrogen levels. Advances in viticultural techniques have helped vineyards in these regions compensate for some of these effects.
*The Maipo Valley is the closest to Santiago and extends eastwards from the city to the Andes and westward to the coast, stretching south toward the towns and subzones of Padre Hurtado, Peñaflor, Talagante, Isla de Maipo and Melipilla.

The Maipo Valley can itself be divided into three sub-regions:

;Alto Maipo:
This sub-region is located in the foothills of the Andes and is highly influenced by the mountains. The climate, cold during the night and sunny and hot during the day, combined with the poor, porous, rocky soil, puts the vines under stress which in turn produces a characteristically bold, elegant Cabernet Sauvignon. 
;Central Maipo:
Corresponds to the area surrounding the Maipo river. Cabernet Sauvignon dominates wine production here, but the area has also started producing Carmenere wines. This sub region has rocky alluvial soils and is the warmest and driest part of the Maipo, requiring drip irrigation.
;The Pacific Maipo:
Area benefits from the coastal influence of the Pacific Ocean as well as the alluvial soils found here. Because of the oceanic influence, it is a popular place to experiment with white grapes, most notably Sauvignon blanc.

* The Rapel Valley is named after the Rapel River and Lake Rapel and is one of the largest wine-producing regions in the Central Valley, producing roughly a quarter of all Chilean wine. It is made up of two smaller sectors, the Cachapoal and Colchagua valleys.

;The Cachapoal Valley:

Cachapoal Valley occupies the northern part of Rapel Valley, located between the heights of Paine to the north and Pelequén to the south, and between the Andes to the west and the smaller Coastal Range to the east. The valley takes its name from the Cachapoal river that flows through Rapel Valley, along with its tributaries, the Claro and Cortaderal rivers. All these watercourses flow into Lake Rapel.
The climate of the valley is temperate and consistently Mediterranean, sheltered by the coastal range from the cooling influences of the Pacific Ocean.
Most of Cachapoal&#x27;s noteworthy wineries and vineyards are located towards the east of the region, in the foothills of the Andes, away from the warmer valley floor. This is an area for Cabernet Sauvignon vines, while closer to the coast, where the ocean breezes flow through the Coastal Range, more Carmenere vines are grown.

Some recommended Wineries from this area are: Altair; Casas del Toqui; Clos des Fous; Los Boldos; Misiones de Rengo; San José de Apalta; Terraustral; Torreón de Paredes; Vik; Viña La Rosa and Viña Tipaume.
; The Colchagua Valley:

Colchagua Valley is one of the best-known wine regions of Chile. It occupies the southern part of Rapel Valley, running from the Andes in the east to the Coastal Range in the west. Most of the important Colchagua vineyards lie in the foothills of the Coastal Range. The area is best known for its full-bodied Malbecs, Cabernet Sauvignons, Carmeneres and Syrahs.
Colchagua has a cool Mediterranean climate, with rainfall, and soils of clay, sand and decomposed granite.

* The Curicó Valley is located south of Santiago, Chile&#x27;s capital city, at 35°S, a similar latitude to the southern tip of Spain. It is divided in two sub-regions: the Teno valley in the north and Lontue in the south. Wine production in this area is known for the variety of grapes, reliability and good value Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc.

Although European vines have been growing in the Curicó area since the mid-1800s, the modern wine production in Curicó began in the late 1970s when Spanish wine maker Miguel Torres decided to explore the capabilities of this area, bringing new technologies such as stainless steel tanks that are now very common in Chilean wine industry. Torres’ endeavour encouraged foreign investment which led to increased plantings and exploration of suitable grape varieties for the area. 

The valley&#x27;s climate is varied. The eastern part near the Andes is cooler than the western side due to the breezes coming down from the mountains, and most of the biggest producers are located in this area of Curicó and in Molina. At the western end, the coastal range protects the valley from the ocean influence.
Curicó Valley is planted with more grape varieties than anywhere else in Chile, but the dominant varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc. Curicó may have yet to produce a Cabernet Sauvignon to rival Maipo&#x27;s red wines and its Sauvignon blanc still does not match the fresh, complex style found in Casablanca, but the valley is one of Chile&#x27;s workhorse regions and its output is consistent and reliable.

* The Maule Valley is located south of Santiago, Chile&#x27;s capital city, and forms part of the Central Valley region. It is one of the largest winegrowing regions in Chile and is also one of country&#x27;s oldest and most diverse valleys.

The size of the region permits a range of distinct microclimates suitable for both red and white wines, though it is best known for its powerful Cabernet Sauvignon and aromatic and spicy Carmenere wines. Rich and volcanic soils predominate in the area, although certain parts of the valley have varying soil types, like the Empedrado area which is dominated by slate soils.
The Maule Valley was one of the first areas in Chile where vines were planted and its viticulture history stretches back to the start of colonisation. The valley was originally known for the quantity more that the quality of its wines, but in recent years it has attracted renewed attention. Since the mid-1990s, new technologies have been introduced allowing the region to improve the quality of its wines. Despite this, some of Maule&#x27;s old techniques have survived and the region is fast becoming known for some 70-year-old Carignan vines that are being used to produce soft, earthy red wines with rich plum and black-fruit flavours. 
Maule lies at the southern end of the Central Valley and is one of the coolest wine-producing areas in Chile, although the Maule River flowing east to west has a moderating effect on the climate. The river also provides the different alluvial soil types found around the region, which included granite, red clay, loam and gravel. On the slopes where the vineyards grow, the soils are free-draining and more fertile on the valley floor.

Many hectares are grown organically and have been certified as organic for decades. The Maule Valley produces good value everyday wines of quality that has been improving over the years. There are also old-bush, dry-farmed vineyards that produce naturally balanced field blends of Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and other yet to be identified varieties. Newer plantations include Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Carmenere with bright acidity and juicy fruit notes.

===Southern Chile===

Lying within the Ñuble and Bío Bío Administrative Region, this area includes three wine-producing sub regions: the Itata Valley, the Bío Bío Valley and the Malleco Valley. The region is primarily known for its mass-produced boxed Pais wine and jug wines, though the Concha y Toro Winery has experimented with Gewürztraminer from this region. Chile&#x27;s southern wine regions have more rainfall, lower average temperatures and fewer hours of sunlight than the northern wine regions.

*The Itata Valley is located in the Ñuble Region, from Santiago, the capital of Chile, and of the major port of Concepción. It is the northernmost of Chile&#x27;s three southern wine regions and stretches roughly from north to south and a similar distance from east to west, but although it is extensive, it has a low density of vineyard plantations. The area is defined by the convergence of the Itata and Ñuble Rivers, and vineyards plantations are mostly found around the cities of Chillán, Quillón and Coelemu. The valley&#x27;s western border is the Pacific Ocean, which has a cooling influence over the valley due to the cold Humboldt current that runs along most of Chile&#x27;s coastline.
The cool Mediterranean climate suits Pais, Muscat of Alexandria and Carignan vines, and more recently, producers have begun to plant more modern grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon.

The soils are alluvial, made up of sand and clay from the Itata and Ñuble rivers. The region is located at a latitude of 36°S, a similar distance from the Equator as southern Spain or the central valley of California.

*The Bío-Bío Valley is located in the province and region of the same name. One of Chile&#x27;s southern wine regions, it has become known for its crisp, aromatic wines.
The region is located at a latitude of 36°S, similar to southern Spain and Monterrey in California. The majority of its vineyards lie between above sea level with a moderate Mediterranean climate. It receives of rain per year, among the highest of all Chilean wine valleys, although winds prevent excessive humidity – a phenomenon that can also be observed in northern France.
For most of the 20th century, the main varieties grown in the Bío Bío valley were Moscatel de Alejandria and Pais (known as Missiones in USA), but today, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon blanc are also grown throughout the valley.

*Malleco is located south of the capital of Chile, Santiago, and lies in the province of the same name. The wine industry here is still developing but good results are already being obtained, particularly from its crispy and fresh Chardonnay and Pinot noir.
The climate is cool, with a high level of rainfall ( a year), a short growing season, and high temperature variation between day and night, which is challenging for wine producers. Most vineyards are located around the town of Traiguen, just south of the Bio Bio Valley. The volcanic soil in Malleco, composed mainly of sand and clay, are reasonably well drained. Although the valley has high rainfall, vines have to make extra effort to hydrate due to the well-drained soil, which results in less foliage and lower grape yields. All these factors produce grapes with more concentrated flavour and excellent structure, which in turn leads to the crispy and fresh wine produced in the region.

==Viticulture==

Chile&#x27;s natural boundaries (Pacific Ocean, Andes Mountain, Atacama Desert to the north and Antarctica to the south) has left it relatively isolated from other parts of the world and has served to be beneficial in keeping the phylloxera louse at bay. Because of this many Chilean vineyards do not have to graft their rootstock and incur that added cost of planting. Chilean wineries have stated that this &quot;purity&quot; of their vines is a positive element that can be tasted in the wine but most wine experts agree that the most apparent benefit is the financial aspect. The one wine region that is the exception to this freedom from grafting is Casablanca Valley whose vines are susceptible to attack by nematodes. While phylloxera is not a problem, winemakers do have to worry about other grape diseases and hazards such as downy mildew, which was spread easily by El Niño influences and severely affected the 1997–1998 vintages. Powdery mildew and verticillium wilt can also cause trouble.

There is not much vintage variation due to the reliability of favorable weather with little risk of summer time frost or harvest time rains. The main exception, again, is Casablanca due in part to its proximity to the Pacific. For the Chilean wine regions in the Valle Central, the Andes and Coastal Ranges create a rain shadow effect which traps the warm arid air in the region. At night, cool air comes into the area from the Andes which dramatically drops the temperature. This help maintain high levels of acidity to go with the ripe fruit that grapes develop with the long hours of uninterrupted sunshine that they get during the day. The result is a unique profile of flavonoids in the wine which some Chilean wineries claim make Chilean wines higher in resveratrol and antioxidants. Harvest typically begins at the end of February for varieties like Chardonnay with some red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon being picked in April and Carmenère sometimes staying on the vine into May.

The Andes also provide a ready source of irrigation which was historically done in flood plain style. Chilean vineyard owners would dig canals throughout their vineyards and then flood the entire surface area with water allowing some to seep into the ground and the run off to be funnel away through the canals. This encouraged excessive irrigation and high yields which had a negative effect on quality. During the wine renaissance of the 1980s &amp; 1990s more vineyards converted to drip irrigation system which allowed greater control and helped reduce yields. The soil composition of Chile&#x27;s vineyards varies from the clay dominated landscapes of Colchagua, which is thus heavily planted with the clay-loving Merlot, to the mixture of loam, limestone and sand found in other regions. In the southern Rapel and parts of Maule, tuffeau soil is present with volcanic soil being found in parts of Curico and Bio-Bio.

==Winemaking==

Chile has benefited from an influx of foreign investment and winemaking talent that began in the late 20th century. Flying winemakers introduced new technology and styles that helped Chilean wineries produce more internationally recognized wine styles. One such improvement was the use of oak. Historically Chilean winemakers had aged their wines in barrels made from rauli beechwood which imparted to the wine a unique taste that many international tasters found unpleasant. Gradually the wineries began to convert to French and American oak or stainless steel tanks for aging.

Financial investment manifested in the form of European and American winemakers opening up their own wineries or collaborating with existing Chilean wineries to produce new brands. These include:

*Robert Mondavi, collaboration with Viña Errázuriz to produce &quot;Sena&quot;
*Miguel A. Torres, Catalan winemaker opened Miguel Torres Chile in 1979
*Château Lafite Rothschild, collaboration with Los Vascos
*Bruno Prats, Owner of Château Cos d&#x27;Estournel, and Paul Pontallier, technical director of Château Margaux, opened Domaine Paul Bruno
*Château Mouton Rothschild, collaboration with Concha y Toro Winery to produce &quot;Almaviva&quot;

===Wine laws===
Chile&#x27;s wine laws are more similar to the US appellation system than to France&#x27;s &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; that most of Europe has based their wine laws on. Chile&#x27;s system went into effect in 1995 and established the boundaries of the country&#x27;s wine regions and established regulations for wine labels. Regulations which in turn, caused mass rebellion and gave rise to the prominent revolutionists Theodore Puccio and Antonio Fráscala. There are no restrictions of grape varieties or viticultural practices. Varietal-labelled wines are required to contain at least 75% of the grape variety if it is to be consumed within Chile. Vintage-dated wines are also required to have at least 75% of grapes harvested in the named year. If it is to be exported, a varietal-labelled wine must contain 85% of the varietal listed on the label as well as at least 85% from the designated vintage year. Exported wines also have to meet minimum alcohol percentage requirements; white wines must reach a minimum level of 12% ABV, while reds must reach a minimum level of 11.5% ABV. To list a particular wine region, 85% is also the minimum requirement of grapes that need to be from that region. Among several labeling terms used to add further definition to a wine&#x27;s style, the term &quot;Reserva Especial&quot; has no legal definition or meaning. However, there are aging requirements for wines labeled with other specific terms: for &quot;especial,&quot; it is two years; four years for &quot;reserva,&quot; and a minimum of six years for &quot;gran vino.&quot;

==Grapes and wines==

Over twenty grape varieties are grown in Chile, mainly a mixture of Spanish and French varieties, but many wineries are increasing experimentation in higher numbers. For most of Chile&#x27;s history, Pais was the most widely planted grape only recently getting passed by Cabernet Sauvignon. Other red wine varieties include Merlot, Carménère, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Cabernet franc, Pinot noir, Syrah, Sangiovese, Barbera, Malbec, and Carignan. White wine varieties include Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Sauvignon vert, Sémillon, Riesling, Viognier, Torontel, Pedro Ximénez, Gewürztraminer and Muscat of Alexandria.

Chilean winemakers have been developing a distinct style for their Cabernet Sauvignon, producing an easy drinking wine with soft tannins and flavors of mint, black currant, olives and smoke. The country&#x27;s Chardonnays are less distinctive, following more the stereotypical New World style. While sparkling wines have been made since 1879, they have not yet established a significant place in Chile&#x27;s wine portfolio. In recent years, the Pais grape variety has been creatively employed on its own or in blends, to make modern wines that have received
favorable reviews.

===Merlot and Sauvignon blanc===
In the late 20th century as Chilean wines became more popular, wine tasters around the world began to doubt the authenticity of wines labeled Merlot and Sauvignon blanc. The wines lack many of the characteristics and typicity of those grapes. Ampelographers began to study the vines and found that what was considered Merlot was actually the ancient Bordeaux wine grape Carménère that was thought to be extinct. The Sauvignon blanc vines were found to actually be Sauvignonasse, also known as Sauvignon vert, or a mutated Sauvignon blanc/Sémillon cross. In response to these discoveries several Chilean wineries began to import true Merlot and Sauvignon blanc cuttings to where most bottles labeled Merlot and Sauvignon blanc from vintages in the 21st century are more likely to be those varieties.

==International competitions==
Chilean wines have ranked very highly in international competitions. For example, in the Berlin Wine Tasting of 2004, 36 European experts blind tasted wines from two vintages each of eight top wines from France, Italy and Chile. The first and second place wines were two Cabernet-based reds from Chile: Viñedo Chadwick 2000 and Sena 2001. The Berlin Wine Tasting of 2005 held in Brazil featured five Chilean wines in the top seven. In the Tokyo Wine Tasting of 2006, Chilean wines won four of the top five rankings.

<text>William Washington Beaudine (January 15, 1892 – March 18, 1970) was an American film director. He was one of Hollywood&#x27;s most prolific directors, turning out a remarkable 179 feature-length films in a wide variety of genres. 

He is best known today for his silent films &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot; and &quot;Sparrows&quot;, both with Mary Pickford; the W. C. Fields comedy &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot;; several Bela Lugosi and Charlie Chan thrillers; &quot;Mom and Dad&quot;, a sex-education exploitation film; and the popular Bowery Boys comedies.

==Early life==

Born in New York City, Beaudine began his career as an actor in 1909, aged 17, with American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. He married Marguerite Fleischer in 1914 and they stayed married until his death. Her sister was the mother of actor Bobby Anderson. Beaudine&#x27;s brother Harold Beaudine was a director of short, action-filled comedies.

In 1915, William Beaudine was hired as an actor and director by the Kalem Company. He was an assistant to director D.W. Griffith on &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Intolerance&quot;. By the time he was 23 Beaudine had directed his first picture, a short called &quot;Almost a King&quot; (1915). He would continue to direct shorts exclusively until 1922, working with Bobby Vernon at the Al Christie studio and Snub Pollard at the Hal Roach studio.

== Career ==

=== Early career as prestige director ===
The 1959 book, &quot;Classics of the Silent Screen: A Pictorial Treasury&quot; (credited to Joe Franklin but actually written by noted film historian William K. Everson), remarks on &quot;what a really fine director William Beaudine was in the silent era, long before he became the principal director of the Bowery Boys &#x27;B&#x27; comedies&quot;. 

Beaudine was very much in demand during the 1920s. He began making feature-length films for then-struggling Warner Bros., demonstrating his clever ways of making films look more expensive than their budgets. This efficiency became a hallmark of Beaudine&#x27;s style. He directed silent films for Goldwyn Pictures (before it became part of MGM), Metro Pictures (also before MGM), First National Pictures, and Sol Lesser&#x27;s Principal Pictures. In 1926 he made &quot;Sparrows&quot;, the story of orphans imprisoned in a swamp farm starring Mary Pickford, and &quot;The Canadian&quot;, based upon a W. Somerset Maugham play and shot on location in Alberta with Thomas Meighan as the lead. Beaudine had at least 30 pictures to his credit before the sound era began. Among his first sound films were short Mack Sennett comedies; he made at least one film for Sennett while contractually bound elsewhere, resulting in his adopting the pseudonym &quot;William Crowley.&quot; He would occasionally use the pseudonym in later years, usually as &quot;William X. Crowley.&quot;

He ground out several movies annually for Fox Films, Warner Bros., Paramount, and Universal Pictures. His most famous credits of the early 1930s are &quot;The Mad Parade&quot; (1931), starring Evelyn Brent in the only World War I battlefield drama with an all-female cast (though men are occasionally heard and parts of their bodies are seen); &quot;Three Wise Girls&quot; (1932), Jean Harlow&#x27;s first starring film; and &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot; (1934), a comedy about old-time show folks starring W. C. Fields.

=== Career in Britain and return to America ===
Beaudine was one of a number of experienced directors (including Raoul Walsh and Allan Dwan) who were brought to England from Hollywood in the 1930s to work on what were in all other respects very British productions. Beaudine directed 11 features there from 1935 through 1937, including &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; (1935) and &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot; (1936) starring Will Hay, and the George Formby comedy &quot;Feather Your Nest&quot; (1937).

Beaudine returned to America in 1937 and had trouble re-establishing himself at the major studios. Once widely known as an A-list director of important productions, Beaudine had commanded a premium salary in the late 1920s that Hollywood producers of the late 1930s didn&#x27;t want to match. He worked briefly at Warner Bros., with whom he had been associated in Britain, and then waited for offers on his terms. They never came. Beaudine had lost much of his personal fortune through no fault of his own (a bank he bought an interest in had failed, and much of his income was claimed by the British government in taxes).

=== Prolific B movie career ===
In 1940 publicist-turned-producer Jed Buell approached Beaudine to direct an all-black-cast feature for Buell&#x27;s Dixie National Pictures. The salary was a flat $500 for one week&#x27;s work. Beaudine knew that if he accepted this job, he would henceforth be associated with low-budget films and would never command his old salary again, but with his finances at a low ebb Beaudine accepted the assignment, under his &quot;William X. Crowley&quot; alias.

Buell was pleased with Beaudine&#x27;s professionalism and inventive ways to extend a shoestring budget. He hired Beaudine to direct &quot;Misbehaving Husbands&quot; (1940), noteworthy at the time as the comeback feature of silent-screen clown Harry Langdon. It was a humble comeback for both Langdon and Beaudine, since it was released by the tiny Producers Releasing Corporation, whose budgets seldom ventured beyond five figures. Langdon and Beaudine received critical raves for their work: &quot;Preview house rewarded them with practically solid laughter&quot; (&quot;Boxoffice&quot;); &quot;Easily [Langdon&#x27;s] best performance in years&quot; (&quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot;). The film&#x27;s success within its own market reestablished both Langdon and Beaudine, albeit in B pictures.

William Beaudine became a low-budget specialist, forsaking his artistic ambitions in favor of strictly commercial film fare, and recouping his financial losses through sheer volume of work. He made dozens of comedies, thrillers and melodramas with such popular personalities as Bela Lugosi, Ralph Byrd, Edmund Lowe, Jean Parker, and The East Side Kids. He became a fixture at the ambitious Monogram Pictures and directed fully half of the 48 comedy features starring The Bowery Boys. By this time Beaudine had a reputation for being a resourceful, no-nonsense director who could make feature films in a matter of days, sometimes as few as five. He occasionally directed special-interest productions, like the 1945 crusade-for-sex-education feature &quot;Mom and Dad&quot;, produced by Kroger Babb, and the 1950 religious drama &quot;Again Pioneers&quot;, produced by the Protestant Film Commission. Beaudine reflected on his B movie career, saying that &quot;[t]hese films are going to be made regardless of who directs them. There&#x27;s a market for them and the studios are going to continue to make them. I&#x27;ve been doing this long enough, I think I can make them as good or better than anyone else.&quot;

Beaudine was often entrusted with series films, including the &quot;Torchy Blane&quot;, &quot;The East Side Kids&quot;, &quot;Jiggs and Maggie&quot;, &quot;The Shadow&quot;, &quot;Charlie Chan&quot;, and &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot; series. His efficiency was so well known that Walt Disney hired him to direct some of his television projects of the 1950s and had him direct a feature western, &quot;Ten Who Dared&quot; (1960). Beaudine became even busier in TV, directing &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, and dozens of &quot;Lassie&quot; episodes.

His last two feature films, both released in 1966, were the horror-westerns &quot;Billy the Kid vs. Dracula&quot; (with John Carradine) and &quot;Jesse James Meets Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. His next film was to have been a screen biography of Lupe Vélez, produced by and starring Estelita Rodriguez, but the project died with Rodriguez in 1966 and Beaudine never made another film. By the end of the decade William Beaudine was the industry&#x27;s oldest working professional, having started in 1909. His final screen credit was posthumous: &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; was compiled from the TV series and released as a feature film in 1974.

==Death==
Beaudine died of uremic poisoning in 1970, aged 78, in California.

== Legacy ==

In 1980, in their tongue-in-cheek book &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;, Michael and Harry Medved included William Beaudine in their list of worst directors of all time. They gave him the unflattering nickname &quot;One-Shot,&quot; because he always seemed to shoot just one take, regardless of actors flubbing their lines or special effects malfunctioning. It is true that Beaudine shot economically—he usually had no choice—but he was always professional, and actually did shoot multiple takes of movie scenes. (The coming-attractions trailers of Beaudine&#x27;s films are rife with alternate takes.)

The Academy Film Archive has preserved three films directed by William Beaudine: &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot;, &quot;Mom and Dad&quot;, and &quot;A Husband in Haste&quot;.

<text>Little House on the Prairie is an American Western historical drama television series loosely based on the best-selling &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; book series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The series is centered on the Ingalls family, who live on a farm on Plum Creek near Walnut Grove, Minnesota, in the 1870s–90s. Charles, Caroline, Laura, Mary, and Carrie Ingalls are respectively portrayed by Michael Landon, Karen Grassle, Melissa Gilbert, Melissa Sue Anderson, and twins Lindsay and Sydney Greenbush.

In 1972, with the encouragement of his wife and daughter, television producer and former NBC executive Ed Friendly acquired the film and television rights to Wilder&#x27;s novels from Roger Lea MacBride and engaged Blanche Hanalis to write the teleplay for a two-hour motion picture pilot. Friendly then asked Michael Landon to direct the pilot; Landon agreed on the condition that he may also play Charles Ingalls. Conflict between Friendly&#x27;s and Landon&#x27;s vision for the show ultimately led to the disinvolvement of Friendly in the production, leaving complete creative control to Michael Landon.

The pilot, which first aired on March 30, 1974, was based on Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s third &quot;Little House&quot; book, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. The rest of the regular series premiered on the NBC network on September 11, 1974, and last aired on May 10, 1982. In the show&#x27;s ninth and final season, with the departure of Michael Landon, the title was changed to Little House: A New Beginning. Three post-series movies were made. Since the original series run, the show has aired continuously in syndication and is available on a number of streaming platforms.

Although initial reviews from critics was less than positive, the series ultimately became an audience favorite, with strong ratings through most of the series run. Initial reviews drew comparisons to &quot;The Waltons&quot;, which was getting solid ratings at the time. Ultimately, positive reviews followed the first season until cancellation, and continued through syndication as the show has remained popular with audiences.

==Synopsis==
Loosely based on the autobiographical &quot;Little House&quot; series, episodes of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; usually concern members of the Ingalls family, who live on a small farm near the village of Walnut Grove, Minnesota. Many episodes concern the maturation of the family&#x27;s second daughter, Laura. Other episodes focus on family and community members, providing a depiction of life in a small agrarian community in late nineteenth-century America. The show&#x27;s central characters are Charles Ingalls (farmer and mill worker), his wife Caroline, and their three daughters, Mary, Laura, and Carrie, though the family expands with the birth of daughter Grace and adoption of son Albert in season five, as well as the adoption of birth siblings Cassandra and James at the end of season seven (a son, Charles &quot;Freddy&quot; Jr., was also born, but died as an infant).

Other essential characters include the Oleson family: Nels, proprietor of the town&#x27;s general store, &quot;Oleson&#x27;s Mercantile&quot; as well as &quot;Nellie&#x27;s Restaurant and Hotel&quot;; his malicious, gossiping wife, Harriet, who runs the mercantile and restaurant with him and serves as the show&#x27;s principal antagonist; and their three children, biologically Nellie and Willie, and adopted Nancy; Isaiah Edwards, Grace Snider Edwards and their three adopted children; the Garvey family, Jonathan, Alice, and Andy; Rev. Robert Alden; Lars Hanson, the town&#x27;s founder and proprietor of the town&#x27;s mill; and Dr. Hiram Baker, the town&#x27;s physician and veterinarian. Teacher-turned-lawyer Adam Kendall is introduced at the end of season four and later weds Mary Ingalls, and Almanzo Wilder is introduced in season six and later weds Laura Ingalls.

When Michael Landon decided to leave the show, the series was retitled &quot;Little House: A New Beginning&quot; with the focus now placed on the characters of Laura and Almanzo, and more characters were added to the cast. Charles is forced to sell the house and move to Burr Oak, Iowa, to pursue new work. Laura and Almanzo remain and become the central characters. A new family, the Carters (Stan Ivar as John, Pamela Roylance as Sarah, Lindsay Kennedy as older son Jeb, and David Friedman as younger son Jason), move into the Ingalls house. Meanwhile, Almanzo and Laura take in their niece, Jenny Wilder (played by Shannen Doherty), when Almanzo&#x27;s brother dies and raise her alongside their daughter, Rose. The show continued to lose viewers, and the retitled version lasted one season.

=== Development ===
Former television executive and producer of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, Ed Friendly, had noticed that his daughter had a habit of reading Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s series of books every year and was convinced they had enormous licensing potential. The copyrights of the works were at the time owned by Roger Lea MacBride. Friendly purchased the television rights to &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; to develop a family-oriented series, while he and Blanche Hanalis wrote the initial screenplay; but the result was not received well by the networks.

Upon seeing the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;The Wish&quot; directed by Michael Landon, Friendly thought Landon could possibly direct the series. Friendly&#x27;s daughter delivered a copy of the screenplay to Landon, after which Landon not only wanted to direct the pilot, he wanted to star in it. Following the cancellation of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, Landon had been given an exclusive contract with NBC to develop new projects. When Landon discovered his daughter had been reading the book series and that his wife had also read them, he also saw the opportunity for a family-oriented series that would encourage children to read. NBC was hesitant; they would be committing to a project from an era the networks were leaving behind. But NBC ultimately trusted Landon&#x27;s intuition and committed to a two-hour pilot movie and a series to follow if ratings warranted. 

Although they agreed that the series should look authentic, Friendly and Landon had different visions of what that meant. Among other differences, Friendly wanted the Charles Ingalls character to have a full beard, while Landon thought it would be bad for his image. Friendly wanted to stick strictly to the stories in the books. Landon, on the other hand, noted that a series run of several years would require much more drama and character development. Eventually, Friendly wanted Landon removed. NBC however, backed Landon, and Friendly ended up as a silent partner. Ultimately, Landon &quot;closely-supervised dimensions of story and character that were not present in the original material... nurtured the cast and crew, directed and wrote most of the stories, and entirely supervised every detail of the series.&quot; As executive producer, his &quot;personal vision is embossed on every one of the 204 color episodes&quot;. The result is a series that is &quot;so different from the books as to constitute a separate body of work&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Following NBC&#x27;s commitment to the series, Landon put his effort into casting. Forty-seven actresses were auditioned for the role of Caroline Ingalls before Landon settled on Karen Grassle. Grassle had university training and a number of repertory theater credits, but minimal television experience. Landon thought she was perfect because she &quot;looked like a pioneer woman&quot;.

Landon&#x27;s most difficult task was casting the children. He did not want &quot;professional daughters with stage mothers&quot;. He wanted &quot;real little girls&quot;. He selected Melissa Sue Anderson as Mary, and Melissa Gilbert as Laura, and gave them the nicknames &quot;Missy&quot; and &quot;Half Pint&quot; so they could be told apart on set. Anderson had only been working in television for less than a year, while the 9-year old Gilbert had been working in television since she was three. Hollywood&#x27;s work rules for small children required the use of twins for the character of Carrie, who was played by Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush. 

=== Writing ===
Writing was one of the many creative differences between Ed Friendly and Michael Landon. Friendly wanted to remain faithful to the original storylines of the books, while Landon saw that producing at least 22 hours of episodic television per year would make it necessary to build fictional stories around the incidents from the books. Thus, only some of the material for the series was taken directly from the books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, as well as from the actual lives of the Ingalls family. While many of the stories were pure fabrications, each was meant to be true to the character of the book series.

The original screenplay adaptation was written by Ed Friendly and Blanche Hanalis. Other writers, including Michael Landon, were used for the series and the post-series movies.

Some episodes written by Michael Landon were recycled storylines he had written for &quot;Bonanza&quot;. To feature Karen Grassle, he wrote &quot;A Matter of Faith&quot; in season two based on the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;A Matter of Circumstance&quot;. In season five, the episode &quot;Someone Please Love Me&quot; had the same theme as the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;A Dream To Dream&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Little Lou&quot; in season nine conveyed the same theme as the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s A Small World&quot;.

=== Production design ===
Both Ed Friendly and Michael Landon wanted the series to look authentic. Landon studied books on frontier life, using them to develop the set design, including tools and household utensils. Along with series art director Trevor Williams, Landon reviewed more than 50 books about frontier life in 1870s Minnesota. Each building used was a replica of an actual building.

=== Filming ===
From the beginning of the pilot, cinematotography was handled by Ted Voigtlander, giving a picture of what faced prairie homesteaders more than a century ago. He remained as principal cinematographer throughout the series, and for the three post-series movies.

Initially, two sound stages at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles were used for the interior shots. In 1978, filming moved to stage 15 at MGM Studios. This was the biggest soundstage at MGM, having been the set for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Location filming for the pilot was done in Sonora, California. During the series, exterior shots for the Ingalls home at Plum Creek and the village of Walnut Grove were filmed at the nearby Big Sky Ranch in Simi Valley. The arid desert land of Ventura county was watered by a series of underground pipes to convert the California desert into a more green Minnesota. Old Tucson Studios was also used for location filming as the village of Mankato, Minnesota.

=== Music ===
The series theme song was titled &quot;The Little House&quot; and was written and conducted by David Rose. Rose composed and scored the music for the pilot movie, 204 episodes of the series, and the movies. The ending theme music, also written by Rose, originally appeared as a piece of incidental music in &quot;Top Hand&quot;, a January 17, 1971, episode of Michael Landon&#x27;s previous series, &quot;Bonanza&quot;. 

=== Cancellation ===
In a 1980 interview, Michael Landon stated the series would end after series eight due to &quot;many contractual agreements&quot;. The show continued beyond that, going into a ninth season. As ratings declined in the final season, Landon felt that the series had run its course, noting, &quot;[W]hen we started this show, we never imagined it would last this long&quot;. Three made-for-television post-series movies followed during the 1983–84 television season: &quot;Little House: Look Back to Yesterday&quot; (1983), &quot;Little House: The Last Farewell&quot; (1984), and &quot;Little House: Bless All the Dear Children&quot; (1984).

&quot;The Last Farewell&quot; was the final movie to be filmed and incorporated a unique ending in which each townsperson takes a turn blowing up his own building in an emotional farewell to the town. The reason for the ending was due to an agreement NBC made with the property owners when it leased the land from the Getty Oil Company and Newhall Land and Development Corporation. They had agreed that at the end of the series, the acreage would be put back to its original state. Michael Landon decided to write the demolition into the show, thus dismantling the sets on camera.

&quot;Bless All the Dear Children&quot; was filmed prior to &quot;The Last Farewell&quot;, but ended up being the last of the three movies to air. Given its Christmas-related content, NBC made a last-minute decision to change the broadcast order, airing it during the Christmas season. A voice-over was added explaining the events occurred prior to the destruction of the town to resolve the continuity problem.

== Themes ==
Opinions vary on whether the series is considered a Western, with critics generally split on this point. Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in &quot;The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present&quot; suggest that the series is &quot;not a Western in the usual sense. There were no cowboys, Indians, or cowtown saloons in this version of frontier life—it was more like &quot;The Waltons&quot; in a different setting.&quot; In &quot;The BFI Companion to the Western&quot;, Edward Buscombe calls it a &quot;middle Western&quot; and a domestic Western. Most television critics have classified it as a &quot;pioneer drama&quot; or a &quot;family Western&quot;. The series hit several themes that place it within the Western genre, including &quot;cowboys and Indians&quot; (pilot and &quot;Freedom Flight&quot;), its west of the Mississippi setting, as well as gunplay and violence. It has also been characterized as a &quot;prairie soap opera&quot; or a &quot;soap opera with horses&quot;.

With total creative control, Michael Landon presented a vision of &quot;the strong, honest pioneer family whose spirit of love and devotion overcomes all physical harshness and obstacles of the heart, and always taught a moral&quot;. He put more emphasis on the family&#x27;s courage rather than their weaknesses. This is especially prominent in the character of Charles Ingalls. Landon preferred a portrayal of Charles that was different from that presented in the books, almost a total opposite. Landon presented him as strong and wise, yet able to maintain his vulnerability. In &quot;The Myth of the American Superhero&quot;, John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett describe this portrayal using the model of the &quot;Heidi man&quot; as a monomythic hero who, like Heidi, uses nonviolence to &quot;heal the sick and bring happiness to the lonely&quot;. They describe the themes of &quot;Little House&quot; as &quot;domestic redeemer tales&quot; and Landon as a &quot;male Heidi [figure] who redeem[s] by nonviolent manipulations&quot;. Using the September 24, 1975, season two episode &quot;Ebenezer Sprague&quot; as an example, Lawrence and Jewett delve into the Pa Ingalls character as embodying the hero&#x27;s journey of the monomyth.

Church, faith, and prayer were all strong themes, which reflected Landon&#x27;s personal experience. Religious themes are more prominent in the television series than they are in the original book series. As historian John Fry notes in &quot;A Prairie Faith: The Religious Life of Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot;, faith, and Christianity in particular, plays a part in the books, but it is not a central theme, whereas it is much more central to the television series. In &quot;Favorite Families of TV&quot;, Christopher and Michael Denis suggest that &quot;[t]his show in many ways was about a strong Christian family struggling to practice Christian principles&quot;. Episodes contained a type of sermonizing that was not a &quot;fire-and-brimstone kind of preachiness, but always the moral lesson learned through tolerance of those different from us, compassion for those less fortunate, patience with those less able&quot;.

&quot;Little House&quot; explored themes involving many social issues including adoption, alcoholism, faith, poverty, blindness, prejudice, bigotry, and racism. Some plots also include subjects of contemporary social issues such as drug addiction, leukemia, child abuse, premarital sex, menopause, and rape.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
The pilot movie aired on NBC, March 30, 1974. Beginning September 11, 1974, the series began airing on Wednesday nights in the 8:00-9:00 EST timeslot. It was moved to Monday nights in the 8:00-9:00 EST timeslot on September 27, 1976 and remained in that timeslot until cancellation. 

In the United States, NBC originally licensed syndication rights for &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; to Worldvision Enterprises, since networks could not own syndication arms at the time. Following its original run, the series has aired continuously in syndication.

===Home media and streaming services===
Initially, some individual episodes were released on DVD and VHS. In 2003, as DVD players reached more than half of the homes with VCRs for the first time, and trends began towards watching entire seasons on DVD, full seasons of &quot;Little House&quot; were released on DVD by Goldhil in partnership with NBC Enterprises. In the U.S. and Canada, NBC Enterprises partnered with Imavision Distribution to release full-season collector&#x27;s editions, due to Imavision&#x27;s expertise in family-oriented products. These initial releases used time compressed episodes that had been prepared for syndication. These sets included interviews with former cast members Alison Arngrim, Dabbs Greer and Dean Butler. For the original movies and complete series sets, Imavision included special features such as interviews with cast members such as Melissa Gilbert and Melissa Sue Anderson, as well as specials highlighting Michael Landon and the casting of the show.

Lionsgate signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Imavision in 2007 to release the entire series on DVD. In 2014, Lionsgate Home Entertainment began re-releasing the series in North America formatted as blu-ray full-frame, DVD full-frame, and ultraviolet HD digital download. The episodes were restored to their original broadcast length and were remastered for high-definition picture and sound. Seasons 1 through 6 each contain a roughly 15-minute segment of a special called &quot;The Little House Phenomenon&quot;. Following the release of the series, an all-movie collection was released in 2016.

To address declining DVD sales in Canada, Imavision began offering the series via real-time streaming in 2012. The series streams on demand on Amazon Prime Video and Peacock, and a free streaming channel showing the series launched on Amazon in June 2023, before expanding to services such as Pluto TV, and The Roku Channel. In January 2025, Nielsen Media Research recognized the show with an ARTEY award as a top streaming legacy program with 13.25 billion minutes viewed on Peacock in 2024. Nielsen reported that 63% of &quot;Little House&quot;’s overall viewing total was from adults 35-64, and that 17% of its total viewership was among black viewers.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reviews ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; television critic John J. O&#x27;Connor gave the pilot film mixed reviews but also noted that it &quot;contained enough family warmth and struggle to make &quot;The Waltons&quot; look like a pack of pampered snobs&quot;, noting that the possibility of a weekly series did have promise. The series itself, however, did not start off with positive reviews. Landon biographer Marsha Daly said, &quot;It was as if they resented its simple, sweet characters, and preferred the trash-with-flash type shows then making in-roads on television.&quot; Daly specifically notes a review by Richard Schidel of &quot;Time&quot; in which he said that Landon looked &quot;as if he just stepped out of a unisex beauty salon on the Strip rather than 430 episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;&quot; and that the show seemed &quot;to be striving for a simple, straightforward style, minimizing both molodramatic and sentimental excesses&quot;. Writing for &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Cleveland Amory wrote, &quot;the show wants to have it both ways... an adult show and a children&#x27;s show. It isn&#x27;t bad as either... [b]ut if it had decided to be just one or the other, it would have been a whole lot better&quot;. By the end of the first season, Amory noted that &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s most disagreeing mail was his critique of &quot;Little House&quot;, and that most viewers considered it to be a good family show. Having admitted to going back to watch it again, he agreed that he had been too hard on it.

Perhaps one of the most glowing reviews came from &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; when it wrote that &quot;to watch &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; is to fall in love with a time, a place, a way of life, a particular family&quot;, further noting that it was &quot;an astounding, skillful production&quot;. Early reviews made constant comparisons to &quot;The Waltons&quot;, a comparison that flattered Landon. During the airing of the series, in 1975 a poll of &quot;Scholastic Newstime&quot; named the show its national favorite.

Even after the series was cancelled and entered syndication, it continues to receive positive reactions from viewers. In 1993, the series was named &quot;All-Time Best Family Show&quot; by a &quot;TV Guide&quot; reader&#x27;s poll. In 1997, &quot;TV Guide&quot; included the two-part episode &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waving as You Drive Away&quot; as #97 on its 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list. The episode was about Mary going blind. &quot;The BFI Companion to the Western&quot; calls the episodes written and directed by Landon, &quot;among the finest episodic stories ever aired for this type of drama&quot;. Christopher and Michael Denis wrote in &quot;Favorite Families of TV&quot;, &quot;The fact that the series was a resounding success, and continues resonating in syndication, affirms Landon&#x27;s belief in his own visions and his remarkable ability to translate them successfully for a mass audience both in the U.S. and abroad.&quot; Even as recently as 2020, outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; have described it as &quot;perfectly balanced between sweet and sour&quot;, while highlighting its simplicity, self-sufficiency, and sentimentality.

=== Viewership ===
The pilot movie beat the competition with a 26.2 rating, representing roughly 45% of all television sets in operation at the time. With the success of the pilot, the series was scheduled into the fall line-up for Wednesday nights at 8pm.

Although the pilot was a ratings success, the series began with low initial ratings. While NBC had concerns, it believed that Landon&#x27;s production was one of its better bets. Realizing that it takes time to build an audience for a quality show, NBC was not about to cancel a program that was receiving high praise from parents and teacher groups. Season 1 had moderate ratings, while season 2 was the lowest ranked season of the series. In 1976, the series was moved to a Monday night time slot. From season three through season seven it was one of NBC&#x27;s highest rated scripted series. In season four, it reached a peak of seventh in the Nielsen ratings, the highest rated show for NBC that season.

===Accolades===
== Subsequent adaptations ==
Following the production of the pilot movie and his objections to how &quot;Little House&quot; was adapted for the screen, Ed Friendly remained involved in name only, although he retained billing in the show&#x27;s credits and received royalty payments. Friendly teamed up again with Blanche Hanalis to produce a similar series based on books from Rose Wilder Lane. The television film &quot;The Young Pioneers&quot; was faithful to the book and received positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. After a second movie, ABC bought the series and turned it over to Lorimar Productions, with Earl Hamner as executive producer. Although the series received positive reviews from critics, it was a flop for the network and was subsequently canceled.

In October 2012, Sony Pictures announced that a film adaptation of the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; novel was under development. In early 2016, it was reported that Paramount Pictures had picked up the project in turnaround, but an agreement was never reached.

In December 2020, Paramount Television Studios and Anonymous Content announced they were developing a reboot as a one-hour dramatic series adaptation. Meeting together at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival in 2020, cast members of the original series expressed their doubts on the likelihood of success with such a project, suggesting that it would not work without the genius of Michael Landon.

On January 29, 2025, Netflix announced a new series based on the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; books written by Laura Ingalls Wilder with CBS Studios in association with Anonymous Content Studios, following from the 2020 reboot plans. Rebecca Sonnenshine is showrunner and an executive producer. Trip Friendly, son of original series producer Ed Friendly, is also an executive producer. Original cast members Allison Arngrim and Dean Butler told &quot;ReMIND Magazine&quot; the new series would be more focused on the original books, rather than a reboot of the original series.

== Legacy ==
The television series boosted the popularity of historic sites where the Ingalls and Wilder families lived as well as leading to the creation of several museums. The original homesite in Walnut Grove, Minnesota averages 10,000 visitors per year.

A musical adaption of &quot;Little House&quot; was staged and performed at the Guthrie Theater in Minnesota in 2008. The production starred Melissa Gilbert, this time in the role of Ma Ingalls. The production toured other cities in 2009.

Surviving cast members Melissa Gilbert, Melissa Anderson, Lindsay Greenbush, Matthew Laborteaux, Alison Arngrim, Dean Butler, Charlotte Stewart, and Karen Grassle reunited for the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2014 for an Entertainment Weekly interview. It was the first time many of them had been together following the 1991 death of Michael Landon.

The 50th anniversary of the series in 2024 spawned multiple reunion interviews and appearances. In March, 2024, Melissa Gilbert, Karen Grassle, and Alison Angrim met for an interview ahead of a planned &quot;Prairie Palooza&quot; event at Big Sky Ranch in Simi Valley, California. The three-day event included panel interviews with cast members, exhibits of &quot;Little House&quot; artifacts such as scripts, merchandise, and other items, as well as recreated miniatures of some of the sets. Michael Landon&#x27;s golf cart that had been made to look like a surrey was also on display. A documentary about the anniversary called &quot;Loving Little House&quot; aired in fall 2024 on Cozi TV, one of the channels regularly airing reruns.

Responding to comments in 2025 from Megyn Kelly about producing a planned remake as a &quot;woke&quot; version of the series, members of the original cast pointed out that original series covered topics many consider to be &quot;woke&quot; such as racism, addiction, nativism, antisemitism, misogyny, rape, and spousal abuse. Melissa Gilbert stated that &quot;the show lives on because a lot of the stories we told are still problems&quot;, suggesting that the show&#x27;s broad appeal is based on universal themes that were relevant not just when it aired but decades after its release, and pointed to interest in the show in 2020 against the backdrop of the George Floyd protests. &quot;Every possible cutting-edge social issue was absolutely discussed … but it was done in such a ‘&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, what would the Ingalls do’ kind of way, that I think people just didn’t even think of it as being a big deal,&quot; Allison Arngrim said. Dean Butler attributed the continued success of the show in 140 countries with that &quot;progressive&quot; perspective to Michael Landon and his ability to make everyone feel welcome. A contributor to &quot;Politico&quot; also analyzed the debate and suggested that it illustrated how American society had become more politicized and noted that the ways the show handled issues such as race and Christianity that did not come across as partisan during its initial airing might be seen more controversially in the present day.

<text>The UNIVAC LARC, short for the &quot;Livermore Advanced Research Computer&quot;, is a mainframe computer designed to a requirement published by Edward Teller in order to run hydrodynamic simulations for nuclear weapon design. It was one of the earliest supercomputers. It used solid-state electronics.

The LARC architecture supported multiprocessing with two CPUs (called &quot;Computer&quot;s) and an input/output (I/O) Processor (called the &quot;Processor&quot;). Two LARC machines were built, the first delivered to Livermore in June 1960, and the second to the Navy&#x27;s David Taylor Model Basin. Both examples had only one CPU, so no multiprocessor LARCs were ever built. Livermore decommissioned their LARC in December 1968 and the Navy&#x27;s LARC was turned off in April 1969.

The LARC CPUs were able to perform addition in about 4 microseconds, corresponding to about 250 kIPS speed. This made it the fastest computer in the world until 1962 when the IBM 7030 Stretch took the title. The 7030 started as IBM&#x27;s entry to the LARC contest, but Teller chose the simpler Univac over the riskier IBM design.

==Description==
The LARC was a decimal mainframe computer with 60 bits per word. It used bi-quinary coded decimal arithmetic with five bits per digit (see below), allowing for 11-digit signed numbers. Instructions were 60 bits long, one per word. The basic configuration had 26 general-purpose registers, which could be expanded to 99. The general-purpose registers had an access time of one microsecond.

LARC weighed about .

The basic configuration had one &quot;Computer&quot; and LARC could be expanded to a multiprocessor with a second &quot;Computer&quot;.

The &quot;Processor&quot; is an independent CPU (with a different instruction set from the &quot;Computer&quot;s) and provides control for 12 to 24 magnetic drum storage units, four to forty UNISERVO II tape drives, two electronic page recorders (a 35mm film camera facing a cathode-ray tube), one or two high-speed printers, and a high-speed punched card reader.

The LARC used core memory banks of 2500 words each, housed four banks per memory cabinet. The basic configuration had eight banks of core (two cabinets), 20,000 words. The memory could be expanded to a maximum of 39 banks of core (ten cabinets with one empty bank), 97,500 words. The core memory had one parity bit on each digit for error checking, resulting in 60 bits per memory word. The core memory had an access time of 8 microseconds and a cycle time of 4 microseconds. Each bank operated independently and could begin a new access in any 4-microsecond cycle when it was not already busy. By properly interleaving accesses to different banks the memory could sustain an effective access time of 4 microseconds on each access (e.g., instruction access in one bank data in another).

The data transfer bus connecting the two &quot;Computer&quot;s and the &quot;Processor&quot; to the core memory was multiplexed to maximize throughput; every 4-microsecond bus cycle was divided into eight 500-nanosecond time slots:

#&quot;Processor&quot; - instructions and data
#&quot;Computer&quot; 1 - instructions
#&quot;Computer&quot; 2 - data
#I/O DMA &quot;Synchronizer&quot; - data
#Not Used
#&quot;Computer&quot; 2 - instructions
#&quot;Computer&quot; 1 - data
#I/O DMA &quot;Synchronizer&quot; - data

The core memory system enforces a system of interlocks and priorities to avoid simultaneous access of the same memory bank by multiple sections of the system (the &quot;Computer&quot;s, &quot;Processor&quot;, and I/O DMA &quot;Synchronizer&quot;s) without conflicts or deadlocks. A memory bank is unavailable for one 4-microsecond cycle after being addressed by any section of the system. If another section attempts to address the same memory bank during this time, it is locked out and must wait, then try again in the next 4-microsecond cycle. To prevent deadlocks and timeouts in the I/O system the following priorities are enforced:

#I/O DMA &quot;Synchronizer&quot; - highest
#&quot;Processor&quot;
#&quot;Computer&quot;s - lowest

If a higher-priority section is locked out in one 4-microsecond cycle, when it tries again in the next 4-microsecond cycle, all lower-priority sections are prevented from beginning a new cycle on that memory bank until the higher-priority section has completed its access.

The LARC&#x27;s Computers wrote lists of &quot;Summary Orders&quot; in memory for the Processor to read and interpret by the &quot;Processor Control Program&quot; (written and supplied by UNIVAC with each system), to request needed I/O.

The LARC was built using surface-barrier transistors, which were already obsolete by the time the first system was delivered. The LARC was a very fast computer for its time. Its addition time was 4 microseconds, multiplication time was 8 microseconds, and the division time was 28 microseconds. It was the fastest computer in 196061, until the IBM 7030 took the title.

==LARC one-digit numeric code==
In the basic five-bit biquinary code of the UNIVAC-LARC, 15 combinations are allowed, any one of which may be stored in any digit position in storage.

<text>Jon B. Erpenbach (born January 28, 1961) is an American politician currently serving as chairman of the Wisconsin Parole Commission in the administration of Governor Tony Evers. He previously served as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin Senate, representing the 27th District from 1999 to 2023.

==Early life, education and career==
Erpenbach was born in Middleton, Wisconsin and graduated from Middleton High School. He attended the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh from 1979 to 1981. He worked as a radio personality on two Madison area radio stations and also worked for a Milwaukee station. He subsequently worked in both the State Assembly and Senate in media relations and as communications director.

== Wisconsin Senate ==
Erpenbach was elected to represent the 27th Senate District in November 1998 and was re-elected in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. He retired from the Senate in 2023. He served as the Democratic Minority Leader from 2003 to 2005. He authored Wisconsin&#x27;s No Call List legislation that was passed and signed into law in 2001. The legislation was a forerunner of the federal government&#x27;s Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003.

===Bills and policy positions===
The achievement that Senator Erpenbach is most well known for is his extremely successful and popular Do Not Call legislation, passed and signed into law in 2001. The bill had bipartisan support in both the Senate and Assembly. The consumer protections in the bill include: allowing consumers to add their land or cellular telephones to the Do Not Call list, creating a prohibition for unsolicited faxes, and Increasing the penalties for violations from the current maximum of $100 to amounts between $1,000 and $10,000. The bill was a forerunner of the federal government&#x27;s Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003.

Erpenbach is well known for his Healthy Wisconsin bill. 

Erpenbach authored the Traveling Sales Crew Regulation bill, also known as Malinda&#x27;s Law, which would give traveling sales crew members similar employment rights that part-time workers in Wisconsin are currently guaranteed by state law. The bill would also require all crews to register with the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection before going door to door in state communities. By registering members of the crew, alerts for members with outstanding warrants in other states can be identified and criminals detained. The bill passed last session in the State Senate but was stopped in the Assembly. It is expected that the bill will become law this legislative session.

===2011 Wisconsin protests===

During the protests in Wisconsin, Erpenbach fled to Illinois along with the 13 other Democratic State Senators to attempt to deny the State Senate a quorum on Governor Scott Walker&#x27;s Budget Repair legislation, ultimately unsuccessfully.

== Wisconsin Parole Commission ==
Erpenbach did not seek reelection to the Senate in 2022 and on January 13, 2023 was appointed chairman of the Wisconsin Parole Commission by Governor Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat.

<text>Basilides (Greek: Βασιλείδης) was an early Christian Gnostic religious teacher in Alexandria, Egypt who taught from 117 to 138 AD, and claimed to have inherited his teachings from the apostle Saint Matthias. He was a pupil of either the Simonian teacher Menander, or a supposed disciple of Peter named Glaucias. The &quot;Acts of the Disputation with Manes&quot; state that for a time he taught among the Persians. According to Agapius of Hierapolis he appeared in the 15th year of the reign of Trajan (113 AD). He is believed to have written over two dozen books of commentary on the Christian Gospel (now all lost) entitled &quot;Exegetica&quot;, making him one of the earliest Gospel commentators.

The followers of Basilides, the Basilideans, formed a movement that persisted for at least two centuries after him – Epiphanius of Salamis, at the end of the 4th century, recognized a persistent Basilidian presence over the Nile Delta in Egypt. It is probable, however, that the school melded into the mainstream of Gnosticism by the latter half of the 2nd century.

==Doctrine==
The diverse and sometimes contradictory descriptions of Basilides&#x27; system by primary sources pose challenges. St. Irenæus portrayed Basilides as a dualist and emanationist in his &quot;Adversus Haereses&quot;, while Hippolytus painted him in his &quot;Philosophumena&quot; as a pantheistic evolutionist.

From Irenaeus&#x27; perspective, Basilides proposed a hierarchy of emanations from an Unborn Father (Abraxas), resulting in multiple heavenly realms and angelic powers, with the Jewish God identified as one of these angels. He introduced Christ as a savior from the angelic rule, implying a replacement of Christ with Simon of Cyrene during the crucifixion.

Epiphanius and Pseudo-Tertullian contribute to this portrayal by associating Basilides with the mystical name Abraxas and contempt for material reality. They indicate that Basilides considered suffering and martyrdom as meaningless and attached to the physical world.

On the other hand, Hippolytus presented Basilides&#x27; teachings as proposing a state of nonexistence prior to creation, brought into existence by a desireless and passionless Not-Being God, who generated the seed of the world. Basilides negated both emanation and the eternity of matter, associating creation with a divine command rather than material processes.

In this view, Basilides described three &quot;Filiations&quot; within the world seed, representing different elements of existence, each striving towards the Not-Being God through different means. He envisaged a divine hierarchy with Archons ruling different heavenly spheres, with the highest being Abraxas.

In the context of Christian history, Basilides constructed an elaborate metaphysical system which, among other features, attributed distinct eras to varying Archons, or rulers of the cosmos. These Archons, according to Basilides, each had dominion over specific epochs. This chronology culminated in what Basilides referred to as the reign of the Gospel, a period where spiritual enlightenment through the teachings of Jesus Christ becomes paramount, marking a significant shift from the previously held dominion of the Archons.

Redemption, as conceived by Basilides, constitutes a return to the primordial state of being, a reversion to the original state of existence before the creation of the world. In this process, each constituent part of existence reverts to its original condition. Material elements, which Basilides associated with the physical world and its inherent imperfections, return to a state of primal chaos. The psychic element, linked with the soul and consciousness, returns to the Hebdomad, a term that in Basilides&#x27; system may refer to the realm governed by the second Archon.

The spiritual element, seen as the highest form of existence, is believed to return to what Basilides cryptically referred to as the Not-Being God, a divine entity that, paradoxically, exists beyond existence itself. This spiritual return signifies a transcendence beyond the physical and psychic realms, a reunification with absolute divinity.

The final state in Basilides&#x27; metaphysical system is known as the Restoration of all things. In this state, Basilides envisions a divine blissful Ignorance being poured over all existence. This doesn&#x27;t denote ignorance in the common understanding as a lack of knowledge or understanding, but rather, a state of divine tranquility and peace, an absence of desire or striving. This state signifies an end to the dualistic conflicts and the cessation of all suffering, a state of perfect unity and harmony. Basilides&#x27; idea of a divine blissful Ignorance, thus, suggests a kind of heavenly serenity, marking the final stage of the cosmic journey towards ultimate redemption.

Ethically, Basilides seems to have assigned faith as a natural trait rather than a conscious choice, and viewed sin and suffering as intrinsic to existence. He conceived evil as an inherent principle, making even Christ a sinful man.

Later interpretations criticized Basilides&#x27; system for potential immorality, though it&#x27;s likely that these accusations did not apply to Basilides himself. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s clear that some forms of Gnosticism, including Basilidianism, led to morally questionable practices over time. Extracts from Basilides&#x27; son and successor suggest indulgence in sensual desires for spiritual peace, possibly corroborating accusations of immorality among Gnostics.

Isidore, the son of Basilides, played a crucial role in the continuation and elaboration of Basilidian Gnosticism. He maintained his father&#x27;s core ideas while also introducing additional elements, some of which seem to have derived from Stoic philosophy and popular superstition. Isidore purportedly developed a more ethically balanced approach, emphasizing the need to abstain from worldly desires in order to achieve the purifying knowledge (Gnosis).

The Basilidian tradition is believed to have survived until the fourth century AD, primarily in Egypt, before eventually fading out due to a combination of external pressure and internal conflicts. The establishment of the Nicene Creed in 325 AD heavily marginalized Gnostic sects, including Basilidianism.

However, the influence of Basilides&#x27; teachings has permeated through history and has been rekindled in the modern era due to increased interest in Gnostic texts. The recovery of the Nag Hammadi library in the mid-20th century, a collection of Gnostic texts, has offered new insights into Gnosticism, including potentially Basilidian beliefs. Despite its demise, Basilidianism has left a lasting impact on religious thought, particularly in terms of its challenge to orthodoxy and its innovative approach to issues of the divine, the cosmos, and the nature of humanity.

While interpreting these historical sources, we must bear in mind that most of these accounts were written by individuals who were opposed to Gnosticism, and therefore, their portrayals are not objective. Interpretations of Basilides&#x27; philosophy are thus subject to ongoing debate among scholars.

===Creation===
His view of creation, according to the orthodox heresiologists, was likely similar to that of Valentinus, whom he rivaled, being based on a &quot;doctrine of emanations&quot; proceeding from an uncreated, ineffable Pleroma. Like his rival, Basilides taught that matter, and the material universe, are evil, and that the God of the Old Testament, who was responsible for creation, is a misguided &quot;archon&quot; or lesser deity.

Historians, such as Philip Shaff, have the opinion that: &quot;Irenaeus described a form of Basilideanism which was not the original, but a later corruption of the system. On the other hand, Clement of Alexandria surely, and Hippolytus, in the fuller account of his &quot;Philosophumena&quot;, probably drew their knowledge of the system directly from Basilides&#x27; own work, the &quot;Exegetica&quot;, and hence represent the form of doctrine taught by Basilides himself&quot;.

===Faith and Election===
Like other gnostics, Basilides taught that salvation comes through knowledge and not faith. This knowledge, or &quot;gnosis&quot;, was considered esoteric, a revelation to human beings by the divine being, Jesus Christ. Faith played no part in salvation. Indeed, Basilides believed faith was merely &quot;an assent of the soul to any of the things which do not excite sensation, because they are not present&quot;. He also believed faith was a matter of &quot;nature,&quot; not of conscious choice, so that men would &quot;discover doctrines without demonstration by an intellective apprehension&quot;. Basilides also appears to have accumulated forms of dignity in accordance with ones&#x27; faith.

Because Basilides believed faith was a matter of nature, doubtlessly he pushed election so far as to sever a portion of mankind from the rest, as alone entitled by Divine decree to receive a higher enlightenment. In this sense it must have been that he called &quot;the elect a stranger to the world, as being by nature supermundane&quot;.

===Biblical canon===
The canon of Basilides had its own Gospel alongside the Gospel of John, rejected the Epistle of Titus and selectively included only specific writings from the Pauline epistles. This canon also contained other unique texts, which are believed to have been penned by Basilides himself or his immediate followers, including the &quot;Interpretations of the Gospels&quot; and the &quot;Exegetica&quot;. Unlike the standard Christian canon, it did not include the Synoptic Gospels—Matthew, Mark, and Luke—as these were considered inconsistent with the Gnostic perspective. Basilides further eschewed mainstream Christian works he perceived as failing to reflect his Gnostic interpretation of Christianity, viewing such texts as distorting the true nature of the divine. As such, the canon of Basilides provides a distinct example of early Christian diversity and the varied textual traditions that existed within the nascent Christian community.

===Metempsychosis===
Basilides likewise brought in the notion of sin in a past stage of existence suffering its penalty here, &quot;the elect soul&quot; suffering &quot;honourably through martyrdom, and the soul of another kind being cleansed by an appropriate punishment.&quot; To this doctrine of metempsychosis the Basilidians are likewise said to have referred the language of the Lord about requital to the third and fourth generations; Origen states that Basilides himself interpreted in this sense,
However, if there be any who suffers without previous sin, it will not be &quot;by the design of an [adverse] power&quot;, but as suffers the babe who appears to have committed no sin. The infant is said to receive a benefit when it is subjected to suffering, &quot;gaining&quot; many hardships.

===Hell===
Origen complained that Basilides deprived men of a salutary fear by teaching that transmigrations are the only punishments after death.

===Martyrdom===
Because Basilides held to a fatalistic view of metempsychosis, he believed the Christian martyrs were being punished not for being Christians, but for sins they had committed in the past. This is why Origen says that he depreciated the martyrs.

===Passions===
The Basilideans were accustomed to call the passions &quot;Appendages&quot;, stating that these are certain spirits that append (προσηρτημένα) themselves to rational souls in a certain primitive turmoil and confusion. Then, they imitate the actions of those they are appended to, and not only acquire the impulses of the irrational animals, but even imitate the movements and beauties of plants. These Appendages can also have characteristics of habit [derived from stones], as the hardness of a diamond.

It is impossible to determine the precise origin of this singular theory, but it was probably connected with the doctrine of &quot;metempsychosis&quot;, which seemed to find support in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;. St. Clement of Alexandria stated that the plurality of souls makes the body a Trojan horse.

==Practices==

===Marriage===
Reciting the views of different heretics on marriage, Clement gives specimens of the teaching of Basilides and his son Isidore, by way of rebuke to the immorality of the later Basilidians. He first reports the exposition of (or a similar evangelic passage), in which there is nothing specially to note except the interpretation of the last class of eunuchs as those who remain in celibacy to avoid the distracting cares of providing a livelihood. He goes on to the paraphrase of , interposing in the midst an illustrative sentence from Isidore, and transcribes the language used about the class above mentioned. 
===Epiphany===
Although we have no evidence that Basilides, like some others, regarded Jesus&#x27;s Baptism as the time when a Divine being first was joined to Jesus of Nazareth, it seems clear that he attached some unusual significance to the event. St. Hippolytus of Rome implied that Basilides regarded the Baptism as the occasion when Jesus received &quot;the Gospel&quot; by a Divine illumination.

&quot;They of Basilides,&quot; says Clement, &quot;celebrate the day of His Baptism by a preliminary night-service of [Scripture] readings.&quot; The Venice MS. states that the Basilideans celebrated the night before the Epiphany singing and flute-playing in a heathen temple at Alexandria: so that probably the Basilidian rite was a modification of an old local custom.

===Meat offered to idols and apostasy===
Eusebius of Caesarea is quoting Agrippa Castor, when he states that Basilides: &quot;taught also that the eating of meat offered to idols and the unguarded renunciation of the faith in times of persecution were matters of indifference&quot;. However, from St. Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s Stromata, it appears that Agrippa Castor misunderstood the purpose of Basilides&#x27;s argument, partly from the actual doctrine and practices of later Basilidians; but it may also have had some justification in incidental words which have not been preserved. It appears as if Basilides was actually saying that the eating of meat offered to idols and apostasy weren&#x27;t condemned for immorality, but were punishments because of immorality.

===Silence===
According to Agrippa Castor, Basilides &quot;in Pythagorean fashion&quot; prescribed a silence of five years to his disciples.

===Prophets===
Agrippa Castor stated that Basilides &quot;invented prophets for himself named Barcabbas and Barcoph, and others that had no existence&quot;. The alleged prophecies apparently belonged to the apocryphal Zoroastrian literature popular with various Gnostics.

===&quot;Traditions of Matthias&quot;===
According to Basilides and Isidore, Matthias spoke to them mystical doctrines which he heard in private teaching from the Saviour. Origen also and after him Eusebius refer to a &quot;Gospel&quot; of or according to Matthias. The true name was apparently the &quot;Traditions of Matthias&quot;.

== &quot;Acts of the Disputation with Manes&quot; ==
The writer of &quot;Acts&quot; held Basilides responsible for dualism, yet his language on this point is loose, as if he were not sure of his ground; and the quotation which he gives by no means bears him out. It is quite conceivable that his understanding of Basilides came from the dualistic Basilidians of his day, who have given a wrong interpretation to genuine words of their master. Indeed the description of evil as a &quot;supervenient&quot; nature &quot;without root&quot;, reads almost as if it were directed against Persian doctrine, and may be fairly interpreted by Basilides&#x27;s comparison of pain and fear to the rust of iron as natural accidents.

The identity of the Basilides of the Acts with the Alexandrian has been denied by Gieseler with some show of reason. It is at least strange that our Basilides should be described simply as a &quot;preacher among the Persians,&quot; a character in which he is otherwise unknown; and all the more since he has been previously mentioned with Marcion and Valentinus as a heretic of familiar name. On the other hand, it has been justly urged that the two passages are addressed to different persons. The correspondence is likewise remarkable between the &quot;treatises&quot; in at least thirteen books, with an interpretation of a parable among their contents, and the &quot;twenty-four books on the Gospel&quot; mentioned by Agrippa Castor, called &quot;Exegetica&quot; by Clement. Thus the evidence for the identity of the two writers may on the whole be treated as preponderating. But the ambiguity of interpretation remains; and it would be impossible to rank Basilides confidently among dualists, even if the passage in the Acts stood alone: much more to use it as a standard by which to force a dualistic interpretation upon other clearer statements of his doctrine.

==Isidorus==
Hippolytus couples with Basilides &quot;his true child and disciple&quot; Isidore. He is there referring to the use which they made of the &quot;Traditions of Matthias&quot;; but in the next sentence he treats them as jointly responsible for the doctrines which he recites. Our only other authority respecting Isidore is Clement (copied by Theodoret), who calls him in like manner &quot;at once son and disciple&quot; of Basilides.

===&quot;Expositions of the Prophet Parchor&quot;===
Isidore&#x27;s &quot;Expositions of the Prophet Parchor&quot; taught the higher thoughts of heathen philosophers and mythologers were derived from Jewish sources. So, by quoting the philosopher Pherecydes, who had probably a peculiar interest for Isidore as the earliest promulgator of the doctrine of metempsychosis known to tradition, Isidore was proving his validity as a descendant of the prophets.

Isidore&#x27;s allegation that Pherecydes followed &quot;the prophecy of Ham&quot; was also used to claim that the apocryphal Zoroastrian books had quasi-biblical sanctity as proceeding from Zoroaster, a son of Noah; so Isidore gladly accepted the theory as evidence for his argument.

===&quot;On an Adherent Soul&quot;===
In his book &quot;On an Adherent Soul&quot;, Isidore appears to have argued against his father&#x27;s teaching on &quot;Appendages&quot;. He insists on the unity of the soul, and maintains that bad men will find &quot;no common excuse&quot; in the violence of the &quot;appendages&quot; for pleading that their evil acts were involuntary: &quot;our duty is&quot;, he says, &quot;by overcoming the inferior creation within us through the reasoning faculty, to show ourselves to have the mastery&quot;.

===&quot;Ethics&quot;===
A passage from Isidore&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; says: &quot;Abstain, then, from a quarrelsome woman lest you are distracted from the grace of God. But when you have rejected the fire of the seed, then pray with an undisturbed conscience. And when your prayer of thanksgiving,&quot; he says, &quot;descends to a prayer of request, and your request is not that in future you may do right, but that you may do no wrong, then marry.&quot;

==Legacy==
Gnosticism was throughout eclectic, and Basilides superadded an eclecticism of his own. Antecedent Gnosticism, Greek philosophy, and the Christian faith and Scriptures all exercised a powerful and immediate influence over his mind. It is evident at a glance that his system is far removed from any known form of Syrian or original Gnosticism. Like that of Valentinus, it has been remoulded in a Greek spirit, but much more completely.

Ancient writers usually name Basilides before Valentinus; but there is little doubt that they were at least approximately contemporaries, and it is not unlikely that Valentinus was best known personally from his sojourn at Rome, which was probably the last of the recorded stages of his life. There is at all events no serious chronological difficulty in supposing that the Valentinian system was the starting-point from which Basilides proceeded to construct by contrast his own theory, and this is the view which a comparison of doctrines suggests.

In no point, unless it be the retention of the widely spread term &quot;archon&quot;, is Basilides nearer than Valentinus to the older Gnosticism, while several leading Gnostic forms or ideas which he discards or even repudiates are held fast by Valentinus. Such are descent from above, putting forth or pullulation, syzygies of male and female powers, and the deposition of faith to a lower level than knowledge. Further, the unique name given by Basilides to the Holy Spirit, &quot;the Limitary (μεθόριον) Spirit,&quot; together with the place assigned to it, can hardly be anything else than a transformation of the strange Valentinian &quot;Limit&quot;.

The same softening of oppositions which retain much of their force even with Valentinus shows itself in other instances, as of matter and spirit, creation and redemption, the Jewish age and the Christian age, the earthly and the heavenly elements in the Person of Jesus. The strongest impulse in this direction probably came from Christian ideas.

An antecedent matter was expressly repudiated, the words of eagerly appropriated, and a Divine counsel represented as foreordaining all future growths and processes; yet the chaotic nullity out of which the developed universe was to spring was attributed with equal boldness to its Maker: Creator and creation were not confused, but they melted away in the distance together. Nature was accepted not only as prescribing the conditions of the lower life, but as practically the supreme and permanent arbiter of destiny. Thus though faith regained its rights, it remained an energy of the understanding, confined to those who had the requisite inborn capacity; while the dealings of God with man were shut up within the lines of mechanical justice.

===Popularity===
Basilides had to all appearance no eminent disciple except his own son. Although Basilides is mentioned by all the Church Fathers as one of the chiefs of Gnosticism, the system of Valentinus seems to have been much more popular and wider spread, as was also Marcionism.

===Influence===
20th-century psychoanalyst Carl Jung wrote his Seven Sermons to the Dead and attributed them to Basilides. The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was interested in Irenaeus&#x27; account of Basilides&#x27; Gnostic doctrine and wrote an essay on the subject: &quot;A Vindication of the False Basilides&quot; (1932). Basilides&#x27; Gnostic Gospel is one of the books mentioned in Borges&#x27;s short story &quot;The Library of Babel&quot; (1941). Basilides also appears in Borges&#x27; &quot;Three Versions of Judas&quot; (1944), which opens with the striking passage: &quot;In Asia Minor or in Alexandria, in the second century of our faith, when Basilides published that the Cosmos was a reckless or evil improvisation by deficient angels...&quot;.

==Sources==

===Church Fathers===
Historians know of Basilides and his teachings mainly through the writings of his detractors, and it is impossible to determine how reliable these accounts are. The oldest refutation of the teachings of Basilides, by Agrippa Castor, is lost, and we are dependent upon the later accounts of:
*Eusebius of Caesarea, &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, , written around the 4th century.
*St. Clement of Alexandria, &quot;Stromata&quot;, Book I, Chapter xxi; Book II, Chapters vi, viii, and xx; Book IV, Chapters xi, xii, and xxv; Book V, Chapter I, etc., written between 208 and 210, and the so-called &quot;Excerpta ex Theodoto&quot; perhaps from the same hand.
*St. Hippolytus of Rome, &quot;Philosophumena&quot;, Book VII, written about 225.
*Pseudo-Tertullian, &quot;Against All Heresies&quot;, a little treatise usually attached to Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;De Praescriptionibus&quot;, but really by another hand, perhaps by Victorinus of Pettau, written about 240 and based upon a non-extant &quot;Compendium&quot; of St. Hippolytus.
*St. Epiphanius of Salamis, &quot;Panarion&quot;, Book I, Sect xxiv.
*Theodoret of Cyrus, &quot;Compendium of Heretical Accounts&quot;, Book I, Chapter iv.

===Writings of Basilides===
Nearly everything Basilides wrote has been lost, but the names of three of his works and fragments are available in the present day:
*Fragments of the Exegetica are available from St. Clement of Alexandria in his &quot;Stromata&quot;, Book IV, Chapter 12, and from Archelaus in his &quot;Acts of the Disputation with Manes&quot;, Chapter 55, and probably also from Origen in his &quot;Commentary on Romans V&quot;, Book I.
*Origen states that &quot;Basilides had even the audacity to write a Gospel according to Basilides&quot;, and both St. Jerome and St. Ambrose repeat Origen. Yet no trace of a Gospel by Basilides exists elsewhere; and it is possible either that Origen misunderstood the nature of the &quot;Exegetica,&quot; or that the Gospel was known under another name.
*Origen in a note on Job, xxi, 1 sqq., speaks of &quot;Odes&quot; of Basilides.

===Other works===
Some fragments are known through the work of Clement of Alexandria:
* The Octet of Subsistent Entities (Fragment A)
* The Uniqueness of the World (Fragment B)
* Election Naturally Entails Faith and Virtue (Fragment C)
* The State of Virtue (Fragment D)
* The Elect Transcend the World (Fragment E)
* Reincarnation (Fragment F)
* Human Suffering and the Goodness of Providence (Fragment G)
* Forgivable Sins (Fragment H)

A book called &quot;Acts of the Disputation with Manes&quot;, which was written during the close of the 3rd century or later, speaks about the Basilidean origins of Manichaeism.

===Artifacts===
*Artistic remains of Gnosticism such as Abrasax gems, and literary remains like the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, the latter part of which probably dates back to the end of the 2nd century and, though not strictly Basilidian, yet illustrates early Alexandrian Gnosticism.

<text>Werner Sombart (; ; 19 January 1863 – 18 May 1941) was a German economist, historian and sociologist. Head of the &quot;Youngest Historical School,&quot; he was one of the leading Continental European social scientists during the first quarter of the 20th century. The term &quot;late capitalism&quot; is accredited to him. The concept of &quot;creative destruction&quot; associated with capitalism is also of his coinage. His &quot;magnum opus&quot; was &quot;Der moderne Kapitalismus&quot;. It was published in three volumes from 1902 through 1927. In &quot;Kapitalismus&quot; he described four stages in the development of capitalism from its earliest iteration as it evolved out of feudalism, which he called proto-capitalism to early, high and, finally, late capitalism – &quot;Spätkapitalismus&quot; – in the post World War I period.

==Life and work==

===Early career, socialism and economics===
Werner Sombart was born in Ermsleben, Harz, the son of a wealthy liberal politician, industrialist, and estate-owner, Anton Ludwig Sombart. He studied law and economics at the universities of Pisa, Berlin, and Rome. In 1888, he received his Ph.D. from Berlin under the direction of Gustav von Schmoller and Adolph Wagner, then the most eminent German economists.

As an economist and especially as a social activist, Sombart was then seen as radically left-wing, and so only received – after some practical work as head lawyer of the Bremen Chamber of Commerce – a junior professorship at the out-of-the-way University of Breslau. Although faculties at such eminent universities as Heidelberg and Freiburg called him to chairs, the respective governments always vetoed this. Sombart, at that time, was an important Marxian, someone who used and interpreted Karl Marx – to the point that Friedrich Engels said he was the only German professor who understood &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. Sombart called himself a &quot;convinced Marxist,&quot; but later wrote that &quot;It had to be admitted in the end that Marx had made mistakes on many points of importance.&quot;

As one of the German academics concerned with contemporary social policy, Sombart also joined the Verein für Socialpolitik (Social Policy Association) around 1888, together with his friend and colleague Max Weber. This was then a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the historical school, who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues.

Sombart was not the first sociologist to devote an entire book to the concept of social movement as he did in his &quot;Sozialismus und soziale Bewegung&quot;, published in 1896. His understanding of social movements was inspired by Marx and by a book on social movements by Lorenz von Stein. For him, the rising worker&#x27;s movement was a result of the inherent contradictions of capitalism. The proletarian situation created a &quot;love for the masses&quot;, which, together with the tendency &quot;to a communistic way of life&quot; in social production, was a prime feature of the social movement.

Sombart&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Der moderne Kapitalismus (Historisch-systematische Darstellung des gesamteuropäischen Wirtschaftslebens von seinen Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart)&quot; is a systematic history of economics and economic development through the centuries and very much a work of the Historical School. The development of capitalism is divided into three stages. The first volume of &quot;Der moderne Kapitalismus&quot; published in 1902, deals with proto-capitalism, the origins and transition to capitalism from feudalism, and the period he called early capitalism —&quot;Frühkapitalismus&quot;— which ended before the Industrial Revolution. In his second volume, which he published in 1916, he described the period that began , as high capitalism —&quot;Hochkapitalismus&quot;. The last book, published in 1927, treats conditions in the 20th century. He called this stage late capitalism —&quot;Spätkapitalismus&quot;, which began with World War I. The three volumes were split into semi-volumes which totaled six books.

Although later much disparaged by neo-classical economists, and much criticized in specific points, &quot;Der moderne Kapitalismus&quot; is still today a standard work with important ramifications for, e.g., the &quot;Annales school&quot; (Fernand Braudel). His work was criticised by Rosa Luxemburg, who attributed to it &quot;the express intention of driving a wedge between the trade unions and the social democracy in Germany, and of enticing the trade unions over to the bourgeois position.&quot;

In 1903, Sombart accepted a position as associate editor of the &quot;Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik&quot;, where he worked with his colleagues Edgar Jaffé and Max Weber.

In 1906, Sombart accepted a call to a full professorship at the Berlin School of Commerce, an inferior institution to Breslau but closer to political &quot;action&quot; than Breslau. Here, inter alia, companion volumes to &quot;Modern Capitalism&quot; dealing with luxury, fashion, and war as economic paradigms appeared; the former two were the key works on the subject until now. Also in 1906 his &quot;Why is there no Socialism in the United States?&quot; appeared. The book is a famous work on American exceptionalism in this respect to this day.

Sombart&#x27;s 1911 book, &quot;Die Juden und das Wirtschaftsleben&quot; (&quot;The Jews and Modern Capitalism&quot;), is an addition to Max Weber&#x27;s historic study of the connection between Protestantism (especially Calvinism) and Capitalism, with Sombart documenting Jewish involvement in historic capitalist development. He argued that Jewish traders and manufacturers, excluded from the guilds, developed a distinctive antipathy to the fundamentals of medieval commerce, which they saw as primitive and unprogressive: the desire for &#x27;just&#x27; (and fixed) wages and prices; for an equitable system in which shares of the market were agreed and unchanging; profits and livelihoods modest but guaranteed; and limits placed on production. Excluded from the system, Sombart argued, the Jews broke it up and replaced it with modern capitalism, in which competition was unlimited and the only law was pleasing the customer. Paul Johnson, who considers the work &quot;a remarkable book&quot;, notes that Sombart left out some inconvenient truths, and ignored the powerful mystical elements of Judaism. Sombart refused to recognize, as Weber did, that wherever these religious systems, including Judaism, were at their most powerful and authoritarian, commerce did not flourish. Jewish businessmen, like Calvinist ones, tended to operate most successfully when they had left their traditional religious environment and moved on to fresher pastures.

In his somewhat eclectic 1913 book &quot;Der Bourgeois&quot; (translated as &quot;The quintessence of capitalism&quot;), Sombart endeavoured to provide a psychological and sociological portrait of the modern businessman, and to explain the origins of the capitalist spirit. The book begins with &quot;the greed for gold&quot;, the roots of private enterprise, and the types of entrepreneurs. Subsequent chapters discuss &quot;the middle class outlook&quot; and various factors shaping the capitalist spirit - national psychology, racial factors, biological factors, religion, migrations, technology, and &quot;the influence of capitalism itself.&quot;

In a work published in 1915, a &quot;war book&quot; with the title &quot;Händler und Helden&quot; Sombart welcomed the &quot;German War&quot; as the &quot;inevitable conflict between the English commercial civilisation and the heroic culture of Germany&quot;. In this book, according to Friedrich Hayek, Sombart revealed an unlimited contempt for the &quot;commercial views of the English people&quot; who had lost all warlike instincts, as well as contempt for &quot;the universal striving for the happiness of the individual&quot;. To Sombart, in this work, the highest ideal is the &quot;German idea of the State. As formulated by Fichte, Lassalle, and Rodbertus, the state is neither founded nor formed by individuals, nor an aggregate of individuals, nor is its purpose to serve any interests of individuals. It is a &#x27;Volksgemeinschaft&#x27; (people&#x27;s community) in which the individual has no rights but only duties. Claims of the individual are always an outcome of the commercial spirit. The &#x27;ideas of 1789&#x27; – Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity – are characteristically commercial ideals which have no other purpose but to secure certain advantages to individuals.&quot; Sombart further claims that the war had helped the Germans to rediscover their &quot;glorious heroic past as a warrior people&quot;; that all economic activities are subordinated to military ends; and that to regard war as inhuman and senseless is a product of commercial views. There is a life higher than the individual life, the life of the people and the life of the state, and it is the purpose of the individual to sacrifice himself for that higher life. War against England was therefore also a war against the opposite ideal – the &quot;commercial ideal of individual freedom&quot;.

===Middle career and sociology===
At last, in 1917, Sombart became professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University, succeeding his mentor Adolph Wagner. He remained in the chair until 1931 but continued teaching until 1940. During that period he was also one of the most renowned sociologists alive, more prominent a contemporary than even his friend Max Weber. Sombart&#x27;s insistence on Sociology as a part of the Humanities (&quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot;) – necessarily so because it dealt with human beings and therefore required inside, empathic &quot;&quot;Verstehen&quot; rather than the outside, objectivizing &quot;Begreifen&quot;&quot; (both German words translate as &quot;understanding&quot; into English) – became extremely unpopular already during his lifetime. It was seen as the opposite of the &quot;scientification&quot; of the social sciences, in the tradition of Auguste Comte, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber – (although this is a misunderstanding since Weber largely shared Sombart&#x27;s views in these matters) – which became fashionable during this time and has more or less remained so until today. However, because Sombart&#x27;s approach has much in common with Hans-Georg Gadamer&#x27;s Hermeneutics, which likewise is a &quot;Verstehen&quot;-based approach to understanding the world, he is coming back in some sociological and even philosophical circles that are sympathetic to that approach and critical towards the scientification of the world. Sombart&#x27;s key sociological essays are collected in his posthumous 1956 work, &quot;Noo-Soziologie&quot;.

===Late career and Nazism===
During the Weimar Republic, Sombart moved toward nationalism.

In 1934, he published &quot;Deutscher Sozialismus&quot; where he claimed a &quot;new spirit&quot; was beginning to &quot;rule mankind&quot;. The age of capitalism and proletarian socialism was over, with &quot;German socialism&quot; (National-Socialism) taking over. This German socialism puts the &quot;welfare of the whole above the welfare of the individual&quot;. German socialism must effect a &quot;total ordering of life&quot; with a &quot;planned economy in accordance with state regulations&quot;. The new legal system will confer on individuals &quot;no rights but only duties&quot;, and &quot;the state should never evaluate individual persons as such, but only the group which represents these persons&quot;. German socialism is accompanied by the &quot;Volksgeist&quot; (national spirit) which is not racial in the biological sense but metaphysical: &quot;the German spirit in a Negro is quite as much within the realm of possibility as the Negro spirit in a German&quot;. The antithesis of the German spirit is the Jewish spirit, which is not a matter of being born Jewish or believing in Judaism but is a capitalistic spirit. The English people possess the Jewish spirit and the &quot;chief task&quot; of the German people and National Socialism is to destroy the Jewish spirit.&quot;

One of Sombart&#x27;s daughters, Clara, was married to Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt, who first described the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

===Legacy===
Sombart&#x27;s legacy today is difficult to ascertain because his Nazi affiliations have made an objective reevaluation difficult (while his earlier socialist ones harmed him with the more bourgeois circles), especially in Germany. In economic history, his &quot;Modern Capitalism&quot; is regarded as a milestone and inspiration, although many details have been questioned. Key insights from his economic work concern the emergence of double-entry accounting as a key precondition for Capitalism (a similar thesis was also discussed by Oswald Spengler) and the interdisciplinary study of the City in the sense of urban studies. Like Weber, Sombart makes double-entry bookkeeping system an important component of modern capitalism. He wrote in &quot;Medieval and Modern Commercial Enterprise&quot; that &quot;The very concept of capital is derived from this way of looking at things; one can say that capital, as a category, did not exist before double-entry bookkeeping. Capital can be defined as that amount of wealth which is used in making profits and which enters into the accounts.&quot; He also coined the term and concept of creative destruction which is a key ingredient of Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s theory of innovation (Schumpeter actually borrowed heavily from Sombart, not always with proper reference to the original work by Sombart). In sociology, mainstream proponents still regard Sombart as a &#x27;minor figure&#x27; and his sociological theory an oddity; today it is more philosophical sociologists and culturologists who, together with heterodox economists, use his work.

One of the reasons of a lack of reception in the United States is that most of his works were for a long time not translated into English - in spite of, and excluding, as far as the reception is concerned, the classic study on &quot;Why there is no Socialism in America&quot;.

However, in recent years, sociologists have shown renewed interest in Sombart&#x27;s work.

<text>Mark Barr McClellan (born June 26, 1963) is the director of the Robert J Margolis Center for Health Policy and the Margolis Professor of Business, Medicine and Health Policy at Duke University. Formerly, he was a senior fellow and director of the Health Care Innovation and Value Initiative at the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at The Brookings Institution, in Washington, D.C. McClellan served as commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration under President George W. Bush from 2002 through 2004, and subsequently as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2004 through 2006.

==Education==

After graduating from the University of Texas in 1985 majoring in English, Biology, and Plan II, he earned his M.D. degree from the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology in 1992 and his Ph.D. in economics from MIT in 1993. He also earned a Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard Kennedy School in 1991. He completed his residency training in internal medicine at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, and he is board-certified in internal medicine. McClellan&#x27;s research studies have addressed measuring and improving the quality of health care, the economic and policy factors influencing medical treatment decisions and health outcomes, estimating the effects of medical treatments, technological change in health care and its consequences for health and medical expenditures, and the relationship between health and economic well-being. He has twice received the Arrow Award for Outstanding Research in Health Economics.

==Career==

===In government===
From 1998 to 1999, McClellan served as deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, where he supervised economic analysis and policy development on a wide range of domestic policy issues.

During 2001 and 2002, McClellan served in the White House. He was a member of the president&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers, where he advised on domestic economic issues. He also served during this time as a senior policy director for health care and related economic issues for the White House.

McClellan served as commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beginning November 14, 2002, becoming the first economist to hold that position. Originally from Austin, Texas, he is the brother of former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan and the son of Texas comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn and attorney Barr McClellan.

He was administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the United States Department of Health and Human Services from 2004 to 2006. In this position, he was responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit program engendered by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act.

Following the resignation of Health &amp; Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson in 2004, McClellan was mentioned as a possible replacement, but President Bush ultimately nominated former Utah governor Mike Leavitt. On September 5, 2006, McClellan announced his resignation from his post in the department. He told The Associated Press he would be leaving the agency in about five weeks and would probably work for a think tank where he could write about improving health care in the United States.

McClellan is the founding chair and senior advisor of the Reagan-Udall Foundation, a public-private partnership between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and industry founded in 2007.

===In academia===

Previously, McClellan was associate professor of economics at Stanford University, associate professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine, a practicing internist, and director of the Program on Health Outcomes Research at Stanford University. He was also a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Additionally, he was a member of the National Cancer Policy Board of the National Academy of Sciences, associate editor of the &quot;Journal of Health Economics&quot;, and co-principal investigator of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal study of the health and economic well-being of older Americans.

==== Hospital Reimbursement Incentives: An Empirical Analysis ====
Source:

Published in 1997 in the &quot;Journal of Economics and Management Strategy&quot;, McClellan&#x27;s paper serves as a review and analysis of provider payment incentives resulting from the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS). Implemented in the 1980s, PPS was intended to incentivize hospitals to drive down costs by limiting the use of costly technologies that added little benefit. The hallmark of the program is the use of fixed payments via diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) in a prospective manner based on diagnosis at the time of admission. McClellan suggests that PPS may not optimally incentivize cost sharing among insurers and health providers due to the income effect by which hospitals may seek out particular diagnoses with higher reimbursement rates, akin to skimming in the insurance arena. Conversely, retrospective cost sharing allows for possible supply induced demand, minimizing the hospital&#x27;s incentive to decrease resource utilization and costs in more complicated cases.
This paper presents an econometric model to summarize these reimbursement incentives, present information on cost sharing and generosity in the PPS model, and discuss the implications of these findings. McClellan points out repeatedly that the PPS has increasingly permitted more retrospective adjustments to the payments. This has been primarily driven through outliers and treatment-driven DRG&#x27;s developed during the admission, rather than diagnosis-driven DRG&#x27;s identified at the time of admission. Outlier payments allow for supplemental payments for unusually lengthy or expensive admissions and make up no more than 5% of all hospital admissions. The author considers the increase in case mix index, a measure of the intensity of care delivered, to have the most important influence on overall PPS payments. He adds that these retrospective adjustments may be hampering the program&#x27;s effectiveness in implementing cost sharing. McClellan&#x27;s model allows individual aspects of PPS to be evaluated for their contribution to cost sharing rates and reimbursement variance. He used linear regression to approximate how the cost sharing reimbursement is derived, using fixed and variable components. Lower costs equaled lower reimbursement; however, higher costs led to higher reimbursements only if the costs were driven by a procedure. This was most true for men aged 65 to 69 with surgery requiring ICU care and an increased length of stay. Generosity estimates indicate that virtually all hospitals do some cost sharing. Higher generosity is usually associated with greater retrospective limits on cost sharing. In the 1990s, high-tech hospitals saw more generous reimbursements and were more likely to survive, whereas for-profit hospitals were more likely to exit the market.

In summary, the Medicare &quot;Prospective&quot; Payment System has multiple retrospective factors that limited cost sharing in 1990. McClellan&#x27;s review serves as a harbinger of current attempts to model a health care reimbursement program focused on pay for performance criteria such as penalties for readmissions and incentives for value-based purchasing. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act continues to drive home the message of cost sharing by reducing reimbursements in the Inpatient Prospective Payment System.

==Role in Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit==
During McClellan&#x27;s tenure as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the makers of Plan B emergency contraception applied for over-the-counter status.

In May 2004, FDA commissioner Steven Galson rejected over-the-counter status for Plan B. The Center for Reproductive Rights then filed a lawsuit, and deposed Dr John Jenkins, director of the FDA&#x27;s Office of New Drugs. Jenkins alleges that he learned in early 2004 that McClellan, then Commissioner of the FDA, had decided against approval even before the staff could complete their analysis. &quot;I think many of us were very concerned that there were policy or political issues that came to play in the decision,&quot; Jenkins stated. He later said he did not know if anyone outside FDA influenced the decision.

McClellan said in his deposition that he was not involved in the decision to reject the initial Plan B application for non-prescription sales; he left the FDA in February 2004 to head the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid. He also said that he was never told by anyone higher up in the Bush administration what to do about the application, although he did say that he &quot;briefed&quot; two White House domestic-policy advisors. The litigation is ongoing; no finding has been made for either side.

<doc id="521338" wikidata="Q5228911" url="?curid=521338" title="Dave Hansen (politician)">
<text>Dave Hansen (born December 18, 1947) is an American Democratic politician and former state legislator. He was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate from 2001 through 2021, representing the 30th senatorial district.

==Early life and education==
Hansen was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay in 1971, marrying Jane Dessart the same year; the couple has three children.

==Early career==
Before being elected to public office, Hansen was a school teacher, a Teamster&#x27;s Union steward, and also a truck driver for the City of Green Bay. He served on the Board of Supervisors for Brown County from 1996 to 2002.

==Wisconsin State Senate==
Hansen was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in November 2000. He defeated incumbent Republican Senator Gary Drzewiecki. He was re-elected in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. He served as the Assistant Democratic Leader from 2003 until 2016.

===2011 Act 10 protests===

On February 20, 2011 Hansen, along with the 13 other Democratic State Senators, fled the state to deny the State Senate a quorum on Governor Scott Walker&#x27;s legislation, which, among other things, limited collective bargaining benefits for most municipal and state employees.

===2011 Recall effort===

Hansen was the target of a recall effort as a result of his leaving the state in an attempt to prevent the Senate from being able to vote on Act 10. On July 19, however, he handily defeated his challenger and retained his seat.

A chronology of the recall effort:

* February 25: The committee &quot;Recall Dave Hansen&quot; officially registered with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. 13,582 signatures were required by April 26, 2011 to force a recall election. He was considered to be one of the three potentially vulnerable Democratic senators.
* April 21: Recall supporters filed about 18,872 signatures with Wisconsin&#x27;s Government Accountability Board.
* June 10: Wisconsin&#x27;s Government Accountability Board certified the recall election.
* July 19: Hansen defeated his recall challenger, Republican David VanderLeest, receiving 66% of the vote.

==Retirement==

On January 9, 2020, Hansen announced he would retire after his term ended in January 2021. He cited the desire to spend more time with his wife, young grandchildren and older grandchildren as they start their careers. Hansen said he raised the possibility of retirement during a family get together over the Christmas holiday. He says his family was very supportive of the decision. Hansen said he was proud of bipartisan cooperation to pass legislation covering senior care and the Silver Alert system. But he also lamented the declining trend away from bipartisanship.

Senator Hansen&#x27;s nephew, De Pere alderman Jonathon Hansen, ran in his uncle&#x27;s senate district following his retirement.

<doc id="521340" wikidata="Q1963025" url="?curid=521340" title="Tolkien fandom">
<text>Tolkien fandom is an international, informal community of fans of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, especially of the Middle-earth legendarium which includes &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. The concept of Tolkien fandom as a specific type of fan subculture sprang up in the United States in the 1960s, in the context of the hippie movement, to the dismay of the author (Tolkien died in 1973), who talked of &quot;my deplorable cultus&quot;. 

A Tolkienist is someone who studies the work of J. R. R. Tolkien: this usually involves the study of the Elvish languages and &quot;Tolkienology&quot;. A Ringer is a fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in general, and of Peter Jackson&#x27;s live-action film trilogy in particular. Other terms for Tolkien fans include Tolkienite or Tolkiendil.

Many fans share their Tolkien fan fiction with other fans. Tolkien societies support fans in many countries around the world.

== History ==

Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a children&#x27;s book, was first published in 1937, and it proved popular. But &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, first published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955, gave rise to fandom as a cultural phenomenon from the 1960s onwards.

=== 1950s ===

Tolkien fandom began within science fiction fandom soon after &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was published in 1954. Tolkien was discussed in science fiction fanzines and amateur press association magazines (&quot;apazines&quot;), both as single essays like &quot;No Monroe In Lothlorien!&quot; in Eric Bentcliffe&#x27;s &quot;Triode&quot;, and in extended threads of comment such as by Robert Lichtman in his &quot;Psi Phi&quot;. Tolkien-inspired costumes were worn at Worldcons from 1958. An organized Tolkien fandom organization called &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; came together in Pittcon, the 18th World Science Fiction Convention in Pittsburgh on 4 September 1960. England&#x27;s first Tolkien fanzine was &quot;Nazgul&#x27;s Bane&quot;, produced by Cheslin. Many fanzines had little Tolkien content but Tolkien-inspired names such as &quot;Ancalagon&quot;, &quot;Glamdring&quot;, &quot;Lefnui&quot;, &quot;Mathom&quot;, &quot;Perian&quot;, &quot;Ringwraith&quot;, &quot;Shadowfax&quot;, and so on. Others had more meaningful Tolkien content. Ed Meskys&#x27; apazine &quot;Niekas&quot; turned into a full-fledged fanzine during this era. Pete Mansfield&#x27;s Sword &amp; Sorcery fanzine, &quot;Eldritch Dream Quest&quot;, included many Tolkien items.

=== 1960s America ===

Foster attributes the surge of Tolkien fandom in the United States of the mid-1960s to a combination of the hippie subculture and anti-war movement pursuing &quot;mellow freedom like that of the Shire&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s cultural Anglophilia&quot; of the time, fuelled by a bootleg paperback version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; published by Ace Books followed up by an authorised edition by Ballantine Books. The &quot;hippie&quot; following latched onto the book, giving its own spin to the work&#x27;s interpretation, such as the Dark Lord Sauron representing the United States military draft during the Vietnam War, to the chagrin of the author who talked of a &quot;deplorable cultus&quot; and stated that &quot;Many young Americans are involved in the stories in a way that I&#x27;m not&quot; but who nevertheless admitted that &quot;... even the nose of a very modest idol [...] cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!&quot; Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory. This embracing of the work by American 1960s counter-culture made it an easy target for mockery, as in Harvard Lampoon&#x27;s parody &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, where Tom Bombadil becomes &quot;Tim Benzedrine&quot;, and Bilbo Baggins becomes &quot;Dildo Bugger&quot;. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; acquired immense popularity in the emerging hacker culture from the mid-1960s, and the technological subcultures of scientists, engineers, and computer programmers. It figured as one of the major inspirations of the nascent video game industry and the evolution of fantasy role-playing games.

=== 1970s to 1980s ===

Isaac Asimov, who had read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; three times by Tolkien&#x27;s death in September 1973, wrote a Black Widowers short story as tribute to the fellow author. &quot;Nothing Like Murder&quot; (1974) mentions college students forming Tolkien societies at Columbia and elsewhere. 

Interest in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; led to several attempts to adapt it for the film medium, most of which were largely unsuccessful. Filmmaker Ralph Bakshi succeeded in securing the rights to produce an animated feature film version, part one of what was originally planned as a two-part adaptation of the story. Bakshi produced the film using, among other animation techniques, rotoscoping, shooting a majority of the film in live-action first before transferring the live footage to animation. While the film had, and continues to have, a mixed critical reaction, it was a financial success, costing USD 8 million to produce, and grossing over USD 30 million at the box office. Despite this fact, United Artists, the film&#x27;s original distributor, refused to fund a sequel, leaving the project incomplete.

=== 1990s ===

The 1990s saw the conclusion of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; series. A series of minor texts by Tolkien were edited in journals such as &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; and &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot;, published by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship since the early 1990s. In the 2000s, several encyclopedic projects have documented Tolkien&#x27;s life and work in great detail, such as the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; (2006) and the twin volumes &quot;The Lord of the Rings: A Reader&#x27;s Companion&quot; and &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide&quot; (2005, 2006). The dedicated journal &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; has been appearing from 2004.

Tolkien discussion took place in many newsgroups from the earliest days of Usenet. The Tolklang mailing list was started in 1990. The alt.fan.tolkien and rec.arts.books.tolkien newsgroups have been active since 1992 and 1993, respectively. Notable points of contention in online discussions surround the origin of orcs, whether elves have pointy ears, whether balrogs have wings, and the nature of Tom Bombadil. Following the announcement of Jackson&#x27;s movies (from 2001), online fandom became divided between &quot;Revisionists&quot; and &quot;s&quot; over controversy surrounding changes to the novel made for the movies, such as those made to the character of Arwen and the absence of Tom Bombadil.

=== 2000s ===

Tolkien fandom changed in character with the release of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy between 2001 and 2003, attracting both a wide audience of existing fans (&quot;book-firsters&quot;) and many people who had not read Tolkien&#x27;s books (&quot;film-firsters&quot;). The large audience made the artistic conception of Jackson&#x27;s artists influential, indeed creating a stereotyped image of Middle-earth and its races of Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and Hobbits shared by fans and artists alike. Some fans, known as Tolkien tourists, travel to places in New Zealand to visit sites where scenes in the films were shot.

A &quot;Tolkien Reading Day&quot;, held annually on 25 March, an anniversary of the fall of Barad-dûr, was proposed by Sean Kirst, a columnist at &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; in Syracuse, New York, and launched by the Tolkien Society in 2003.

== &quot;Essential&quot; websites ==

Four websites are described as &quot;essential&quot; in Stuart D. Lee&#x27;s 2014 scholarly handbook &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;: the Tolkien Gateway, The One Ring.Net, The Tolkien Library (which is mainly a book site), and The Tolkien Society (which is an educational charity and literary society).

=== Tolkien Gateway ===

The Tolkien Gateway is a factual site that documents all Middle-earth characters, places, objects, and events, with citations to Tolkien&#x27;s texts. It provides some coverage of related non-Tolkien items such as films, actors, games, music, images, and scholarly books. The site is described in &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot; as &quot;the main source to start a review of the plethora of Tolkien-based online materials.&quot; It is referenced in scholarly works such as &quot;VII&quot;, &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot;, and &quot;Social Science Computer Review&quot;.

=== TheOneRing.net (or TORn) ===

A fansite of Jackson&#x27;s movies is TheOneRing.net (TORn), which was popular with the cast and crew of the film series. TORn was originally a small movie-news site. The filmmakers put effort into winning over fans, actively supporting sites for &quot;Ringers&quot;. The site was founded in 1999 by a group of Tolkien fans eager for the upcoming trilogy. In 1998, Michael &#x27;Xoanon&#x27; Regina and Erica &#x27;Tehanu&#x27; Challis started a website related to the filming, including &quot;spy&quot; reports from Tehanu&#x27;s visit to the New Zealand set. This activity got her escorted off the set, and then invited back on to take an official look around and meet director Peter Jackson. In early 1999, a designer by the username of Calisuri came across the site and offered technical help. Calisuri&#x27;s friend Corvar, who he was acquainted with from the Nightmare LPMud, was brought aboard to provide server and business help. Xoanon, Tehanu, Calisuri and Corvar then formed The One Ring, Inc. and are the sole owners/founders of TheOneRing.net.

The site is unique in having had a mutual working relationship between its crew and that of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, and later of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films. This enabled the site to bring its readers exclusive news from the set, as when Peter Jackson emailed TheOneRing.net to get his side heard when a lawsuit threatened his chance to film &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. 

In 2003, Cold Spring Press released TORn&#x27;s book &quot;The People&#x27;s Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien&quot; with essays defending fantasy as a genre, discussions of Tolkien&#x27;s views of good and evil, and an examination of cultural norms. The foreword by the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey says: &quot;The Internet, the experience of continually answering questions and receiving comments ... give the organizers of TheOneRing.net a perspective which is uniquely broad, and uniquely full of surprises, some of which would have pleased Tolkien very much, but which he could not have expected.&quot; A second volume was published in 2004. Over 1,500 &quot;Ringers&quot; (Lord of the Rings fans) came to the TheOneRing.net Oscar party at the Hollywood, American Legion on 28 February 2004, attended by Jackson, Fran Walsh, Elijah Wood and other cast and crew. On 2 September 2004, eleven commemorative kauri trees, paid for by TORn members, were planted in Willowbank Park in Wellington, New Zealand, Peter Jackson&#x27;s home town. The number eleven represented the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring, plus one each for Jackson and Tolkien. TheOneRing.net teamed up with Creation Entertainment to present The One Ring Celebration (ORC) in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Its sister convention, Eastern LOTR Fan Gathering (ELF), met in the eastern U.S. in 2005 and 2006. These conventions included panels and signings by leading members of the cast. In November 2008 and December 2011, TheOneRing.net and Red Carpet Tours staged a 14-night cruise between Auckland and Sydney, including excursions to film locations.

=== Other sites ===

TheOneRing.com (TORc) is a Tolkien fan site that caters more to the fans of Tolkien&#x27;s literary works than Jackson&#x27;s films. It was founded by Jonathan Watson, Ted Tschopp and David Mullich in April 1999. As of 2022, Watson has continued to run the website. The site is referenced by &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Arda&quot; provides a detailed online reference to Middle-earth, mirrored at GlyphWeb.

A fan edit of the theatrical cut of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; exists, called &quot;The Two Towers: The Edit&quot;. Most of the changes in 2007 were incorporated into &quot;The Lord of the Rings – The Purist Edition&quot;, a fan edit which turns the entire trilogy into an eight-hour film without most of the changes.

== Tolkienology ==

Tolkienology is a term used by fans to describe the study of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien treating Middle-earth as a real ancient history, conducting research from an &quot;in-universe&quot; perspective. This differs from Tolkien studies in that it ignores the real-world history of composition by the author, and assumes an underlying internally consistent Middle-earth canon. Tolkienology may include:

* Tolkienian linguistics: Study of the most complete languages Tolkien designed for Middle-earth, (usually Quenya and Sindarin), study of the writing systems, the most known being the Tengwar, and possible reconstruction for everyday use, including by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.
* debate on the &quot;true&quot; nature of Tom Bombadil, of balrogs etc. and debate on the &quot;real&quot; motivations of characters in the stories
* Genealogies of Hobbit families and kings.
* The accuracy of Tolkien&#x27;s calendars and how can they be used today.
* Reconstruction of history (of Elven kingdoms, Arnor and Gondor, Rohan or the more unknown lands).
* Morality issues such as whether an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent Ilúvatar (God) would destroy Númenor, if the &#x27;bad&#x27; Dunlendings had any right rivalling the &#x27;good&#x27; Rohirrim and if Gondor committed genocides.
* Possible census of population about each race.
* Astronomic descriptions in the books (moon phases, positions of stars), and what can be inferred about the geography of Middle-earth from them.
* Strategies of wars and battles, if they were right and what alternatives might have been.
* Possible folkloric impressions Hobbits had about places of the Shire and other whereabouts, determined by translating placenames.

=== Linguistics ===

The studies of Tolkien&#x27;s artistic languages (notably Quenya and Sindarin) is a field where fandom and scholarly Tolkien studies overlap. The resulting friction between scholarly students of the languages focusing on their conceptual evolution and fandom-oriented students taking an &quot;in-universe&quot; view became visible in the &quot;Elfconners&quot; controversy of the late 1990s, involving among others the linguists David Salo and Carl F. Hostetter, the editor of Vinyar Tengwar. There is a &quot;reconstructionist&quot; camp, which pursues the reconstruction of unattested Elvish forms, and a &quot;philological&quot; or &quot;purist&quot; camp which focuses entirely on the edition of the fragments in Tolkien&#x27;s unpublished papers. By its nature, reconstructionism aims for a &quot;canon&quot; of &quot;correct&quot; standard Elvish (Neo-Eldarin), while the philological study of the evolution of Tolkien&#x27;s conceptions cannot assume that the languages had ever reached a complete or internally consistent final form. The &quot;reconstructionist&quot; camp is represented by Salo, who translated the poems in the libretto by Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens for the Music of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, creating additional words in languages including Sindarin where necessary, while the &quot;purist&quot; camp is represented by Hostetter.

== Fan creativity ==

=== Fan fiction ===

Tolkien fan fiction is fantasy fiction, often published on the Internet, by Tolkien fans. It is based either directly on some aspect of Tolkien&#x27;s books on his fantasy world of Middle-earth, or on a depiction of this world, especially in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film series or other film depictions of that world. A wide range of types of writing have resulted, including homoerotic slash fiction and several strands of feminist storytelling.

=== Fan art ===

Jackson&#x27;s films made the work of the artists involved influential, indeed creating a stereotyped image of Middle-earth and its races of Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and Hobbits shared by fans and artists alike. Some fan artists draw inspiration from other sources; Anna Kulisz states that she based her painting of Arwen sewing Aragorn&#x27;s banner on Edmund Leighton&#x27;s 1911 painting &quot;Stitching the Standard&quot;. The German illustrator Anke Eißmann started out creating fan art, illustrating the German Tolkien Society&#x27;s &quot;Der Flammifer von Westernis&quot; from 1991. She went on to make numerous paintings of scenes from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Jenny Dolfen too has made paintings of scenes from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, making the transition from self-taught fan art to becoming a recognised and published artist.

== By region ==

Dedicated Tolkien Societies provide platforms for a combination of fandom and academic literary study in several countries.

<text>Mattersburg (; formerly &quot;Mattersdorf&quot;, , Croatian: &quot;Matrštof&quot;) is a town in Burgenland, Austria. It is the administrative center of the District of Mattersburg and was home to former Bundesliga football team, SV Mattersburg.

== Location ==
Mattersburg lies in the northern part of Burgenland, east of Wiener Neustadt in the Wulka River Valley, in a rural region of the country.

Mattersburg is reachable by road using the Burgenland Highway S31 from Eisenstadt and Oberpullendorf or the Mattersburg Highway S4 from Wiener Neustadt.

Mattersburg is connected by rail with Wiener Neustadt and Sopron by the Mattersburg Railway.

Mattersburg&#x27;s two boroughs are Mattersburg and Walbersdorf.

== History ==
The site of Mattersburg was already populated in antiquity based on excavations of Roman and Longobard graveyards.
The town was first mentioned in writing as &quot;Villa Martini&quot; in 1202, when it was a property of the Nagymartoni family of Aragonese origin. Its Hungarian name (Nagymarton) also refers to the church consecrated to Martin of Tours. Originally the German name was &quot;Mattersdorf&quot; and it was renamed to &quot;Mattersburg&quot; in 1924. &quot;Matter&quot; originated from &quot;Martin&quot; and also refers to St. Martin of Tours, while &quot;Dorf&quot; means &quot;village&quot; and &quot;Burg&quot; means &quot;castle&quot;.

The area&#x27;s original fortress had already been torn down by 1294. 
Mattersburg was elevated to the status of a market town in 1354. The town was destroyed by fire in the year 1774 and again in 1856. The area&#x27;s wealth increased when the railway began running from Wiener Neustadt to Mattersburg in 1847. During the 19th century, the town was the site of a ceramics factory founded by János Ziegler in 1815 or 1818, producing yellow coloured wares following the style of Vienna porcelain.

The town was one of the Burgenland Siebengemeinden. The first Jews to settle in the town arrived in the 16th century, having been expelled from Sopron, and their presence in the town increased greatly over the following years. In 1671, the Jews were forced to abandon the town by the order of Leopold I. They were allowed to return to Mattersdorf, as it was then called, in 1678, although they were forced to buy back their own possessions. The self-governing Jewish community was merged with the rest of the town in 1902/03.

As with the rest of Burgenland, Mattersburg belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary until 1920 and it was the seat of the Nagymarton district in Sopron county. In late 1918, Mattersburg locals rebelled against Hungarian rule to create the short-lived Republic of Heinzenland aimed at unifying with Austria. After the end of the First World War, German West-Hungary was given to Austria in the Treaties of St. Germain and Trianon; there it formed the new province of Burgenland. Mattersburg kept the official name of Mattersdorf until June 14, 1924; on July 2, 1926, it received town privileges. In 1978, Mattersburg incorporated the village of Walbersdorf.

After the Anschluss in February 1938, the Jewish population of Mattersburg was expelled and dispossessed, so that already in the autumn of 1938, there were no more Jews in Mattersburg. In the course of the war, more than two hundred of the town&#x27;s residents were missing or killed. Approximately one hundred of its Jewish residents were murdered in the Holocaust.

== Politics ==
The Mayor of Mattersburg is Ingrid Salamon of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ); there are two Vice-Mayors: the first is Klaus Leitgeb of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) and the second Josef Reisner of the SPÖ. The District Mayor of the Borough of Walbersdorf is Hubert Lang of the SPÖ and Johann Wallner is the Chief Officer.

Mattersburg&#x27;s municipal council has 25 seats with party mandates as follows: 9 ÖVP, 14 SPÖ, 1 Freedom Party (FPÖ), 1 Grüne, other lists 0.

== Sport ==
Mattersburg was home to the former Austrian Bundesliga team, SV Mattersburg until its dissolution in 2020, and is the home of the Sports table football Subbuteo team, TFC Mattersburg.

== Economy ==
One of the largest businesses in the area is the food company Felix Austria, who have their main headquarters in Mattersburg.

<text>The Salt River (Spanish: &#x27;, O&#x27;odham [Pima]: &#x27;, Yavapai: &#x27; or &#x27;, Maricopa language: Va Shly&#x27;ay) is a river in Gila and Maricopa counties in Arizona, United States, that is the largest tributary of the Gila River. The river is about 200 miles (320 km) long. Its drainage basin covers about 13,700 square miles (35,000 km2). The longest of the Salt River&#x27;s many tributaries is the 195-mile (314 km) Verde River. The Salt&#x27;s headwaters tributaries, the Black River and East Fork, increase the river&#x27;s total length to about 300 miles (480 km). The name Salt River comes from the river&#x27;s course over large salt deposits shortly after the merging of the White and Black Rivers.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Salt River has also been known as:
* Assumption 
* Black River 
* Blau Fluss 
* Blue River 
* Rio Asuncion
* Rio Azulrio de Lasrio 
* Rio de la Asuncion 
* Rio de las Balsas 
* River of the Rafts 
* Salada 
* Salinas 
* Rio Salado
==Course==
The Salt River is formed by the confluence of the White River and the Black River in the White Mountains of eastern Gila County. The White and Black rivers, and other tributaries of the upper Salt River, drain the region between the Mogollon Rim in the north and the Natanes Mountains and Natanes Plateau to the east and south. Tributaries of the Salt River also drain the Sierra Ancha and Mazatzal Mountains. The White and Black rivers drain the White Mountains in the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Together the two rivers drain an area of about . The Salt River, along with the Black River, forms the boundary between the Fort Apache Indian Reservation to the north and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation to the south.

The Salt River is fed by numerous perennial streams that start as springs and seeps along the Mogollon Rim and in the White Mountains. The Salt River is perennial from its tributary headwaters to Granite Reef Diversion Dam near Mesa.

From the Black and White confluence, the Salt River flows generally west and southwest. It is joined by Carrizo Creek, a perennial stream, and then flows through the Salt River Canyon. Cibecue Creek, a perennial stream, joins the river in the canyon, flowing from the north through the Fort Apache Reservation. Between Carrizo and Cibecue creeks, the Salt River becomes the boundary between the Tonto National Forest on the south and the Fort Apache Reservation on the north. Another perennial stream joins from the north, long Canyon Creek, followed by Cherry Creek. Just downstream from the Salt&#x27;s confluence with Medicine Creek, a portion of the Tonto National Forest is designated the Salt River Canyon Wilderness. The Salt River forms the northern and western boundary of the wilderness for several miles, after which the national forest and wilderness occupy both sides of the river.


Continuing its westward course, the Salt River is joined by Pinal Creek from the south, just before leaving the Salt River Canyon Wilderness. The river continues to flow through the Tonto National Forest until leaving the mountains near Mesa. Below the Pinal Creek confluence, the Salt River enters Theodore Roosevelt Lake, the first of four reservoirs on the river. Tonto Creek joins the Salt River in Theodore Roosevelt Lake. Below Theodore Roosevelt Dam, the Salt River passes through the canyon between the Mazatzal Mountains and the Superstition Mountains and is impounded by Horse Mesa Dam (forming Apache Lake) then Mormon Flat Dam (forming Canyon Lake) then Stewart Mountain Dam (forming Saguaro Lake). These four reservoirs are part of the Salt River Project. The water is used by the Phoenix metropolitan area for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes. The storage capacity of the reservoirs is for Roosevelt, for Apache, for Canyon, and for Saguaro.

As the Salt River passes through its reservoirs, it flows by the Four Peaks Wilderness, near the Four Peaks. A few miles downstream of Stewart Mountain Dam, the last of the four Salt River Project dams, the Verde River joins the Salt from the north. Fountain Hills is located a few miles to the northwest. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is located near the Verde–Salt confluence. The Tonto National Forest ends a couple miles below the Verde River confluence, and the Salt River enters the eastern edge of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. Less than from the national forest boundary, the Granite Reef Diversion Dam diverts all remaining water in the Salt River into the Arizona Canal and Southern Canal, which deliver drinking and irrigation water to much of the Phoenix metropolitan area. The dam and canals are part of the Salt River Project.

Below the diversion dam, the bed of the Salt River is dry, except following rain or upstream runoff. The USGS stream gage at 51st Avenue, Phoenix, records no flow at all on many days—in 2009, for example, there was no flow for most of the year, except during parts of February and March when the river&#x27;s discharge reached an average of . The diversion capacity at Granite Reef Diversion Dam is , with for the Arizona Canal, and for the Southern Canal.

Below Granite Reef Dam, the Salt River leaves the mountains and flows past the cities of Mesa, Tempe, and Scottsdale, then south of downtown Phoenix, where it passes north of South Mountain Park. With the exception of Tempe Town Lake, the riverbed winding through the cities is usually dry, except when heavy rains upstream force Stewart Mountain Dam to release more water than can be diverted at Granite Reef Dam. The Salt River joins the Gila on the southwestern edge of Phoenix, approximately from the center of the city. Monument Hill overlooks the confluence of the two rivers and is the site of the Initial Survey point for Arizona, the Gila and Salt River Meridian.

===River modifications===
The Salt River formerly flowed through its entire course year-round. However, the free-flowing river would frequently flood, including a massive flood in 1891. This flood, as well as others, led to the construction of several dams, beginning with the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, have caused the river to become intermittent in many parts.

Despite the dry river bed, or arroyo, dangerous flash floods occasionally occur, especially during monsoon storms in late July and early August. Flood waters can wash out roads. Bridges have been damaged, notably in 1980, 1993, and 2005. The natural flow of the Salt is at its mouth. However, except after rainfall, the Salt is dry or a small stream below Granite Reef Dam. The river was formerly navigable throughout its course by small craft. The river is still navigable in the majority of the area where it still carries water. 

The river was used for irrigation by the pre-Columbian Hohokam culture, by later Native Americans, and by early Euro-American settlers in the 19th century. It currently provides a major source of irrigation and drinking water for Phoenix and surrounding communities through the Salt River Project. The river&#x27;s water is distributed over more than of irrigation canals, used primarily for the growing of cotton, alfalfa, fruit, and vegetables.

==Ecology==
North American beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) historically flourished on the river. In an historical account, George C. Yount, a fur trapper with the Pattie expedition, wrote on 1 February 1863, &quot;...we began to ascend the Black River [Salt River]... We found it to abound with beavers... We followed up this stream to where it forks in the mountains; that is to say, about 80 miles from its mouth.&quot;

In 2022, fish kill was caused in three lakes by golden algae.

==Water quality==
There are turbidity problems along many stream reaches in Salt River&#x27;s watershed; these are related to rangeland management, recreation, mining, sand and gravel operations, and other sources. High levels of fecal coliform bacteria and ammonia have been reported for Carrizo Creek and the White River.

==History==

In ancient times, the river was home to the Salado culture and the Hohokam culture. The Akimel O&#x27;odham, also known as the Pima people, lived along the Salt River and dug canals, using irrigation to provide water to their villages and farms in the arid environment. The river was known to the authorities of New Spain as the &quot;Río Salado&quot;. The United States government recognized the territory of the Pima people by way of executive order signed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. A subsequent executive order also signed by President Hayes reduced the size of the Salt River portion of the reserve from approximately 680,000 acres to 46,627 acres. Today the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community live alongside the bank of the Salt River maintaining their traditions and way of life from before European colonization.

<text>Total War is a series of strategy games developed by British developer Creative Assembly for personal computers. They combine turn-based strategy and resource management with real-time tactical control of battles. Rather uniquely for real-time strategy games, flanking manoeuvers and formations factor heavily into gameplay. The first of the series, &quot;&quot;, was released in June 2000. The most recent major game released was &quot;Total War: Pharaoh&quot; on 11 October 2023. As of April 2021, the series had sold over 36 million copies.

==Main games==

===&quot;Shogun: Total War&quot;===

Released in June 2000, &quot;Shogun: Total War&quot; is the first game in the series. The game is set in feudal Japan. The single-player game includes interactive videos that represented possible decisions by the player, such as converting to Christianity. The original &quot;Shogun&quot; was not a mainstream product, but attracted a dedicated fan base. An expansion pack, &quot;The Mongol Invasion&quot;, was released with the original in the &quot;Warlord Edition&quot;.

===&quot;Medieval: Total War&quot;===

&quot;Medieval: Total War&quot; was released in August 2002. Using the same game engine as &quot;Shogun&quot;, the game takes players to medieval Europe. The expansion pack is called &quot;Viking Invasion&quot;, and the combined edition is called the &quot;Battle Collection&quot;. It was one of the best-selling games in the &quot;Total War&quot; series.

===&quot;Rome: Total War&quot;===

Released in 2004&quot;, Rome: Total War&quot; is set in the Roman Republic. This was the first game to encompass what would become one of the most fundamental additions to the &quot;Total War&quot; series, free map movement as opposed to earlier versions where all movement was province-based. The game also featured the first 3D map. The first expansion pack, &quot;&quot;, was released on 27 September 2005. &quot;Rome: Total War Gold Edition&quot;, which combined the fully patched versions of the original game and its first expansion into one DVD (instead of the original game&#x27;s three CD-ROMs), was released on 14 February 2006. A CD-ROM version (a total of four CDs) was also produced. A Mac version of &quot;Rome: Total War Gold Edition&quot;, developed by Feral Interactive, was released 12 February 2010. A second expansion pack, &quot;&quot;, was released on 19 June 2006. A compilation of the original game and the two expansions, &quot;Rome: Total War Anthology&quot;, was released on 16 March 2007. The series has also spawned several popular mods such as &quot;Europa Barbarorum&quot; and &quot;&quot; each of which seeks to create more historically accurate settings. This game was also added to mobile, offering a simplified version of the original game. &quot;Rome: Total War&quot; has won many strategy gaming awards for its realistic campaign and battlefield animation and interface. Total War: Rome Remastered was released on 29 April 2021 by Feral Interactive.

===&quot;Medieval II: Total War&quot;===
&quot;Medieval II: Total War&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Medieval: Total War&quot;, was released on 10 November 2006 in Europe and on 14 November in North America. The game includes much more detailed characters and features the Age of Discovery (and colonisation of the Americas) and the Mongol and Timurid invasions. An expansion pack, &quot;Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms&quot;, was announced on 30 March 2007. It was released on 28 August 2007. The &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of the game, containing the original game and the expansion pack, was released on 1 February 2008. The &quot;Kingdoms&quot; expansion pack contained 4 campaigns: the Britannia Campaign, set in the British Isles in 1258, during the reign of Henry III of England; the Crusades Campaign, set in the Middle East in 1174; the Teutonic Campaign, set in the Baltic region of Eastern Europe in 1250; and the Americas Campaign, set in the New World in 1521, during the decline of the Aztec and Maya civilisations.

===&quot;Empire: Total War&quot;===
&quot;Empire: Total War&quot; was announced on 22 August 2007 by Sega and had been secretly in development since the release of &quot;Barbarian Invasion&quot;. Players choose an 18th-century faction and set out to achieve domination over the known world through military force, diplomacy, espionage and economics. For the first time in a &quot;Total War&quot; game, players have the ability to play real-time 3D naval battles. Also a feature that had been developed in the game was the decentralisation of provinces, adding greater realism in that many features, from production to technological advancement, would occur outside of the capital of the province. &quot;Empire: Total War&quot; was released on 3 March 2009 in North America and 4 March in Europe. The expansion pack, &quot;Empire: Total War: Warpath&quot;, was released in October 2009. &quot;Warpath&quot; is set in the Americas where it is possible to control one of five different Native American nations. While the game was critically acclaimed due to its innovative game play, the game has been subject to most of the criticism of the &quot;Total War&quot; series by many critics and fans after its release due to bugs; Sega claims nearly all issues have been resolved. The issues have been explained by Creative Assembly several months after the game&#x27;s release. It was the first in the series to use Valve&#x27;s Steamworks DRM and achievements system, thereby requiring Steam to be played. A mobile version of the game developed by Feral Interactive was released on 21 November 2024 for both iOS and Android.

===&quot;Napoleon: Total War&quot;===
&quot;Napoleon: Total War&quot; was released in North America on 23 February 2010, and in Europe on 26 February. The game focuses on the politics and major military campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th century and the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century. &quot;Napoleon&quot; was released with several editions: the &quot;Standard Edition&quot; (as well as a limited edition version of the &quot;Standard Edition&quot;), &quot;Imperial Edition&quot;, and the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Edition&quot; (available in Australia and New Zealand only). Players assume the role of Napoleon Bonaparte or one of his major rivals on a turn-based campaign map and engage in the subsequent battles in real-time. As with its predecessor, &quot;Empire: Total War&quot;, which included a special episodic United States story line, &quot;Napoleon&quot; features three separate campaigns that follow the general&#x27;s early Italian and Egyptian campaigns as well as the European campaign and the Battle of Waterloo.

In the grand campaign, &quot;Campaigns of the Coalition&quot;, the player plays as Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, or Russia in a map that spans Europe. There is also a second campaign available as DLC, the &quot;Peninsular campaign&quot;, in which the player vies for control of the Iberian peninsula. The campaign is playable as either France, Spain, or Great Britain. &quot;Napoleon: Total War Gold Edition&quot; premiered for Macs on 3 June 2013.

===&quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot;===

On 2 June 2010 Creative Assembly released a full preview of &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot; set in the middle of the 16th century in Medieval Japan during a period of isolation and military conflict called Sengoku Jidai (the warring states period). The new battle engine supports up to 56,000 soldiers in a single battle, making them significantly larger than in &quot;Napoleon&quot;. &quot;Shogun 2&quot; is the first game of the series to feature the franchise&#x27;s name appearing as the primary title in an effort to increase brand awareness. The game was released on 15 March 2011.
&quot;Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai&quot; is a stand-alone expansion to &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot; released in March 2012. The game explores the conflict between the Imperial throne and the last Shogun around the time of the Boshin War in 19th-century Japan, 300 years after the events of the original game in a clash of traditional Samurai culture with the power of modern weaponry. There are six new playable clans (Satsuma, Tosa, and Choshu, Imperial and Aizu, Nagaoka, and Jozai Shogunate) plus four DLC clans (Tsu, Saga, Obama, and Sendai), supporting either the Imperial throne or the Tokugawa Shogunate. Also portrayed in a limited role are Britain, United States, and France, with each of whom trade deals can be struck (given the proper infrastructure) and from whom marines can be recruited. A new feature is the land and sea unit interactions which includes the ability to call in offshore artillery support barrages, coastal gun emplacements that target enemy ships, and the ability to call in campaign map bombardments – bombarding armies and cities in adjacent coastal areas of the campaign map. Other new features are railway networks, ironclad warships, improved siege battle mechanics (with upgradable tower defences, each with their own specialty), new agent types, the ability to control two armies on the battle map at the same time, a third-person shooter for torpedo gunboats, coastal batteries, Gatling guns and cannons, and a multiplayer overhaul.

===&quot;Total War: Rome II&quot;===

On 2 July 2012, Creative Assembly announced &quot;Total War: Rome II&quot; with a live-action trailer that features different scenes with the theme &quot;How far will you go for Rome?&quot;. Work on the title began during the development of &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot;. Creative Assembly announced that the game would have a bigger map than its predecessor, &quot;go more to the east&quot;, have many new game features, and new camera views in-battle, allowing the player to see the battle from almost every angle. They further claimed that the game was developed using a new programming system, which allows it to achieve better graphical quality, including dynamic facial expressions. The game was released on 3 September 2013. This title hit record high pre-order sales for Creative Assembly, with the Greek States Culture Pack unlocking Sparta, Athens, and Epirus in the campaign as a pre-order bonus. The initial release suffered from significant performance issues as well as having many bugs that severely affected gameplay.

===&quot;Total War: Attila&quot;===

On 25 September 2014, Creative Assembly announced &quot;Total War: Attila&quot; at the Eurogamer Expo. Using the same engine as &quot;Total War: Rome II&quot;, the game followed the life of Attila the Hun during the Dark Ages of Europe, much like &quot;Napoleon: Total War&quot; did with Napoleon&#x27;s life after &quot;Empire: Total War&quot;. According to Creative Assembly, &quot;Total War: Attila&quot; would implement an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; atmosphere, with hostile weather and darker lighting. &quot;Total War: Attila&quot; was released on 17 February 2015.

===&quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot;===

Announced on 22 April 2015, &quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot; changes the rules of the series as it takes place in a setting of high fantasy. The setting comes from Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;. The real-time battles and turn-based sandbox campaigns, a staple of the series, return. Races include the men of the Empire and Bretonnia, Orcs and Goblins (Greenskins), Dwarves, Vampire Counts, the Warriors of Chaos, Beastmen, Wood Elves, and the Norscan Tribes. Sega revealed this is the first in what will be a trilogy of titles. &quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot; was released on 24 May 2016.

===&quot;Total War: Warhammer II&quot;===

Announced on 31 March 2017 at EGX Rezzed. It was released on 28 September 2017. It focuses on the conflicts in the New World and Ulthuan between the High Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven, and Lizardmen as they seek to control the Vortex. Later, the Tomb Kings (an Ancient Egyptian themed faction of skeletons, mummies etc.) and Vampire Coast (an undead pirate faction) were released as paid DLC. A grand campaign combining the map from the first game and the second was also released called &quot;Mortal Empires.&quot;

===&quot;Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia&quot;===
&quot;Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia&quot; was released on 3 May 2018. The game is set in 878 AD, after the death of Ragnar Lodbrok and subsequent Viking invasion of the British Isles by the Great Heathen Army. The game focuses on the kingdoms vying for power of the Isles. The playable factions are English, Welsh, Gaelic, part of the Great Viking army, and the Viking sea kings. The game received generally favourable reviews from critics but a mixed response from users. The game holds a Critic Score of 75 and a User Score of 54 on Metacritic.

===&quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;===
Released on 23 May 2019, &quot; Three Kingdoms&quot; brings the &quot;Total War&quot; series to China during the rule of the Han dynasty in 190 AD where the child Emperor Xian of Han is placed on the throne as a puppet ruler by his regent Dong Zhuo. The game centres on heroes who fight tyranny but whose ambitions may break their fragile alliance and divide China leading up to the rise of the Three Kingdoms period. The game is based on the ancient Chinese novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

Players can play warlords such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. The graphics are different. There is a new battle system enabling the player to select Records, a more realistic mode, or Romance, seen by some to be a more fun and creative way to play. In Romance, players can control their warlords who now have special abilities. The campaign has also changed. There are six DLCs available: &quot;Eight Princes&quot;, set almost a hundred years after the original campaign; &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;, set eight years before, in the wake of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, &quot;A World Betrayed&quot;, set four years after the original campaign, &quot;Fates Divided&quot;, six years after &quot;A World Betrayed&quot; before the war between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao, &quot;Yellow Turban Rebellion&quot;, which allows the player to play as the Yellow Turban Faction within the original campaign; &quot;Reign of Blood&quot;, similar to the other DLCs available in &quot;Total War: Rome II&quot; and &quot;Total War: Attila&quot; called &quot;Blood and Gore&quot; and &quot;Blood and Burning&quot; respectively. &quot;Reign of Blood&quot; adds a new variety of combat animations and blood on the battlefield. A major expansion pack, &quot;The Furious Wild&quot; is also available, adding the Nanman people with four playable factions in the southwest.

===&quot;Total War Saga: Troy&quot;===

While in development &quot;Total War Saga: Troy&quot; used the &quot;Saga&quot; moniker, as did &quot;Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia&quot; and as has retroactively been applied to &quot;The Fall of the Samurai&quot; standalone expansion for &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot;. It is to be the first &quot;Total War&quot; game set in the Bronze Age and was released on August 13, 2020. The game was free to claim for the first 24 hours after its release.

On September 24, &quot;Amazons&quot; was released as a free DLC for Total War Access account holders alongside Epic Games Store Mod Support, while multiplayer and &quot;Blood &amp; Glory&quot; DLC was added October 29, 2020.

===&quot;Total War: Warhammer III&quot;===

Announced on 3 February 2021, the conclusion to the &quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot; trilogy introduces factions based on each of the four Chaos Gods (Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh), as well as the human civilisations of Kislev and Grand Cathay. The Ogre Kingdoms were included as a pre-order bonus. The game was released on 17 February 2022. Although, technically it is not a live service game, the Warhammer trilogy life-span means it is close to the live service genre at times.

=== &quot;Total War: Pharaoh&quot; ===

&quot;Total War: Pharaoh&quot;, focused on the New Kingdom period of Ancient Egypt, was announced on 23 May 2023 and released on 11 October 2023.

==Spin-off games==
===&quot;Spartan: Total Warrior&quot;===

&quot;Spartan: Total Warrior&quot; was developed by Creative Assembly and released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. &quot;Spartan: Total Warrior&quot; is a hack-and-slash action title that was to bring &quot;Total War&quot;″s hallmark large-scale battles to the console market. Rather than adhering to historical accuracy, Creative Assembly took inspiration from Greek and Roman mythology to craft a setting that allows for more fantastical set pieces and foes. The player takes the role of a Spartan warrior guided by Ares, tasked with defeating the invading Roman Empire. The game features both a &quot;campaign mode&quot; and an &quot;arena battle&quot; mode. The campaign mode takes place over 14 levels, while the arena battle mode tasks the players with surviving enemy assaults of increasing difficulty. An indirect follow-up called &quot;&quot; was released in 2008, dropping the &quot;Total Warrior&quot; moniker.

===&quot;Total War: Arena&quot;===

&quot;Total War: Arena&quot; was a free-to-play game that was discontinued in February 2019.

===&quot;Total War: Elysium&quot;===
&quot;Total War: Elysium&quot; is an upcoming free-to-play strategy digital collectible card game where the player controls generals from across history in head-to-head battles against other players.

===Total War Battles Series===

====&quot;Total War Battles: Shogun&quot;====

&quot;Total War Battles: Shogun&quot; was released on 20 April 2012 for iOS. This game was also released for Android devices and Microsoft Windows. Set in medieval Japan, the game utilises real-time strategy and, like other Total War games, combines troop organisation and management, combat, and building management. Available troops include samurai, archers, ninja, and cavalry. The battle system uses hexagon tiles for movement and placement, and a new key feature to this game enforces the &quot;Bushido&quot; code of conduct where, once units are moved forward, they can no longer move backward. 1 vs 1 local multiplayer is available.

====&quot;Total War Battles: Kingdom&quot;====
From the team behind &quot;Total War Battles: Shogun&quot;, &quot;Total War Battles: Kingdom&quot; entered open beta on PC on 9 March 2015, following a limited closed beta. Set in medieval England, the game combines realm building and management with real-time battles and has been released for PC, Android, and iOS. Support ended on 28 April 2022 and the game is no longer available to play.

====&quot;Total War Battles: Warhammer&quot;====
&quot;Total War Battles: Warhammer&quot; is the upcoming third release of the Total War: Battles Series. Developed by NetEase, Total War Battles: WARHAMMER is officially licensed by Creative Assembly and Games Workshop. It aims to bring deep strategic gameplay in the epic Warhammer Fantasy Battles world to millions of mobile devices worldwide. The game will support Android and iOS Platforms.

<text>A proboscis () is an elongated appendage from the head of an animal, either a vertebrate or an invertebrate. In invertebrates, the term usually refers to tubular mouthparts used for feeding and sucking. In vertebrates, a proboscis is an elongated nose or snout.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1609 from Latin , the latinisation of the Ancient Greek (), which comes from () &#x27;forth, forward, before&#x27; + (), &#x27;to feed, to nourish&#x27;. The plural as derived from the Greek is , but in English the plural form &quot;proboscises&quot; occurs frequently.

==Invertebrates==
The most common usage is to refer to the tubular feeding and sucking organ of certain invertebrates such as insects (e.g., moths, butterflies, and mosquitoes), worms (including Acanthocephala, proboscis worms) and gastropod molluscs.

===Acanthocephala===

The Acanthocephala, the thorny-headed worms or spiny-headed worms, are characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis, armed with spines, which they use to pierce and hold the gut wall of their host.
===Lepidoptera mouth parts===

The mouth parts of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part is known as the proboscis or &#x27;haustellum&#x27;. The proboscis consists of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. The proboscis contains muscles for operating. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction takes place due to the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. A specific example of the proboscis being used for feeding is in the species &quot;Deilephila elpenor&quot;. In this species, the moth hovers in front of the flower and extends its long proboscis to attain its food.

A few Lepidoptera species lack mouth parts and therefore do not feed in the imago. Others, such as the family Micropterigidae, have mouth parts of the chewing kind.

The study of insect mouthparts was helpful for the understanding of the functional mechanism of the proboscis of butterflies (Lepidoptera) to elucidate the evolution of new form-function. The study of the proboscis of butterflies revealed surprising examples of adaptations to different kinds of fluid food, including nectar, plant sap, tree sap, dung and of adaptations to the use of pollen as complementary food in &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies. An extremely long proboscis appears within different groups of flower-visiting insects, but is relatively rare.

=== Gastropods ===


Some evolutionary lineages of gastropods have evolved a proboscis. In gastropods, the proboscis is an elongation of the snout with the ability to retract inside the body; it can be used for feeding, sensing the environment, and in some cases, capturing prey or attaching to hosts. Three major types of proboscises have been identified: pleurembolic (partially retractable), acrembolic (fully retractable), and intraembolic (variable in structure). Acrembolic proboscises are usually found in parasitic gastropods.

==Vertebrates==

The elephant&#x27;s trunk and the tapir&#x27;s elongated nose are called &quot;proboscis&quot;, as is the snout of the male elephant seal.

Notable mammals with some form of proboscis are:

* Aardvark
* Anteater
* Elephant
* Elephant shrew
* Hispaniolan solenodon
* Echidna
* Elephant seal
* &quot;Leptictidium&quot; (extinct)
* &quot;Moeritherium&quot; (extinct)
* Numbat
* Proboscis monkey
* Saiga antelope
* Members of the tapir family

The proboscis monkey is named for its enormous nose.

The human nose is sometimes called a proboscis, especially when large or prominent.

<text>A by-law (bye-law, by(e)law, by(e) law), is a set of rules or law established by an organization or community so as to regulate itself, as allowed or provided for by some higher authority. The higher authority, generally a legislature or some other government body, establishes the degree of control that the by-laws may exercise. By-laws may be established by entities such as a business corporation, a neighbourhood association, or depending on the jurisdiction, a municipality.

In the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, the local laws established by municipalities are referred to as &quot;by&quot;(&quot;e&quot;)&quot;-laws&quot; because their scope is regulated by the central governments of those nations. Accordingly, a bylaw enforcement officer is the Canadian equivalent of the American Code Enforcement Officer or Municipal Regulations Enforcement Officer. In the United States, the federal government and most state governments have no direct ability to regulate the single provisions of municipal law. As a result, terms such as &quot;code&quot;, &quot;ordinance&quot;, or &quot;regulation&quot;, if not simply &quot;law&quot;, are more common.

==Etymology==
The Merriam-Webster Dictionary indicates that the origin of the word by-law is from the English word &quot;bilawe&quot;, probably from Old Norse &quot;*bȳlǫg&quot;, from Old Norse &quot;bȳr&quot; town + &quot;lag-, lǫg&quot; law. The earliest use of the term, which originates from the Viking town law in the Danelaw, wherein &quot;by&quot; is the Old Norse word for a larger settlement as in Whitby and Derby (compare with the modern Danish-Norwegian word &quot;by&quot; meaning town, or the modern Swedish word &quot;by&quot;, meaning village). However, it is also possible that this usage was forgotten and the word was &quot;reinvented&quot; in modern times through the use of the adverbial prefix &quot;by-&quot; giving the meaning of subsidiary law or side-law (as in &quot;byway&quot;). In any case, it is incorrect to claim that the word is related to the prepositional phrase &quot;by law&quot;; that is a modern conjecture contradicted by the evidence.

==Municipal by-laws==
Municipal by-laws are public regulatory laws; which apply in a certain area. The main difference between a by-law and a law passed by a national/federal or regional/state body is that a by-law is made by a non-sovereign body, which derives its authority from another governing body, and can only be made on a limited range of matters. A local council or municipal government derives its power to pass laws through a law of the national or regional government which specifies what things the town or city may regulate through by-laws. It is therefore a form of delegated legislation.
Within its jurisdiction and specific to those areas mandated by the higher body, a municipal by-law is no different from any other law of the land, and can be enforced with penalties, challenged in court, and must comply with other laws of the land, such as the country&#x27;s constitution. Municipal by-laws are often enforceable through the public justice system, and offenders can be charged with a criminal offence for breach of a by-law. Common by-laws include vehicle parking and stopping regulations, animal control, building and construction, licensing, noise, zoning and business regulation, and management of public recreation areas.

===Japan===
Under Article 94 of the Constitution of Japan, regional governments have limited autonomy and legislative powers to create by-laws. In practice, such powers are exercised in accordance with the Local Autonomy Law.

By-laws therefore constitute part of the legal system subordinate to the Japanese constitution. In terms of its mandatory powers and effective, it is considered the lowest of all legislation possible.

Such powers are used to govern the following:
* Location of the seat of government of the prefecture
* Frequency of routine meetings
* Number of prefectural vice-governors and vice village leaders
* Number of staff attached to administrative bodies governed
* Placement of regional autonomous areas
* Regulation of certain municipal monies
* Placement, maintenance and removal of public facilities
* Appointment of subordinate offices by the prefectural governor

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, by-laws are laws of local or limited application made by local councils or other bodies, using powers granted by an Act of Parliament, and so are a form of delegated legislation.

===Australia===
In Australian Law there are five types of by-law, and they are established by statute:
* State government authorities create by-laws as a type of &quot;statutory rule&quot; under an empowering Act; such by-laws must be &quot;made&quot; (or at least formally approved) by the State governor.
* Local government by-laws are the most prevalent type of by-law in Australia, and regulate such things as parking, drinking alcohol in public places, fire prevention, and zoning controls. In New South Wales these by-laws are called &quot;ordinances&quot;, and zoning controls are called &quot;Environmental Planning Instruments&quot; created under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act.
* Numerous specific institutions, including universities, are also empowered to make by-laws by their establishing legislation.
* By-laws of a company or society are created as a contract among members, and a formal process must be followed to adopt or amend them.
* Strata title was developed in Australia and by-laws of body corporate are also empowered by state legislation. Many people come into contact with strata by-laws on a regular basis, since they affect what people living in strata title housing can do in their homes. The most well-known of these is the &quot;no pets in flats&quot; rule.

==Organizational by-laws==
Corporate and organizational by-laws regulate only the organization to which they apply and are generally concerned with the operation of the organization, setting out the form, manner, or procedure in which a company or organisation should be run. Corporate by-laws are drafted by a corporation&#x27;s founders or directors under the authority of its charter or articles of incorporation.

=== Typical articles ===
By-laws widely vary from organization to organization, but generally cover topics such as the purpose of the organization, who are its members, how directors are elected, how meetings are conducted, and what officers the organization will have and a description of their duties. A common mnemonic device for remembering the typical articles in by-laws is NOMOMECPA, pronounced &quot;No mommy, see pa!&quot; It stands for name, object, members, officers, meetings, executive board, committees, parliamentary authority, amendment. Organizations may use a book such as &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; &quot;Newly Revised&quot; for guidelines on the content of their by-laws. This book has a sample set of by-laws of the type that a small, independent society might adopt.

The wording of the by-laws has to be precise. Otherwise, the meaning may be open to interpretation. In such cases, the organization decides how to interpret its by-laws and may use guidelines for interpretation.

=== Amendment ===
Usually, one of the last sections in the by-laws describes the procedures for amending them. It describes who can amend them (usually the membership, but it could be the organization&#x27;s board of directors), how much notice is needed, and how much of a vote is needed. A typical requirement is a two-thirds vote provided that previous notice was given or a majority of all the members.

=== Relation to other governing documents ===
In parliamentary procedure, including &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, the by-laws are generally the supreme governing document of an organization, superseded only by the charter of an incorporated society. The by-laws contain the most fundamental principles and rules regarding the nature of the organization.

It was once common practice for organizations to have two separate governing documents, a constitution and by-laws, but this has fallen out of favor because of the ease of use, increased clarity, and reduced chance of conflict inherent in a single, unified document. This single document, while properly referred to as the by-laws, is often referred to as a &quot;constitution&quot; or a &quot;constitution and by-laws&quot;. Unless otherwise provided by law, the organization does not formally exist until by-laws have been adopted.

=== Application to organizations ===

====Unions====
In some countries, trade unions generally have constitutions, which govern activities of the international office of the union as well as how it interfaces with its locals. The locals themselves can set up their own by-laws to set out internal rules for how to conduct activities.

In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, union by-laws are sometimes a subset of the union&#x27;s constitution or implement the union&#x27;s rules in more detail.

==== Nonprofit organizations ====
Nonprofit organizations in the United States applying for Federal Tax-Exemption Status are required to adopt bylaws for their organizations. Bylaws for nonprofit organizations by themselves are more of an internal organizing document than required by most states but are necessary for filing for nonprofit 501(c)(3) tax-exemption application using the Form 1023.

<text>Dame Monica Jessie Dacon ( Sheen, born 4 June 1934) is a Saint Vincent and the Grenadines former schoolteacher, educator and politician. She is the widow of parliamentarian St. Clair Dacon.

She attended The Girls&#x27; High School and passed both the Cambridge School Certificate and the Cambridge Higher School Certificate. In 1952 she began teaching at her alma mater and the Boys’ Grammar School. She would return to the Girls&#x27; High School eleven years later having taught in two Trinidad and Tobago schools, before returning to St. Vincent to teach at the Bishop&#x27;s College, Kingstown in 1966. 

She was acting Principal of Bishop&#x27;s College for a few months before going back to the Girls&#x27; High School where she remained for nearly fifteen years. She continued her studies and gained the St. Vincent Teachers&#x27; College Certificate in 1980 and two years later her Bachelor of Education degree from the University of the West Indies. On her return to St. Vincent she moved from secondary education to the tertiary level and became a lecturer at the St. Vincent Teachers&#x27; Training College.

She was appointed Deputy Governor General in 2001 when Sir Charles Antrobus was Governor General. She became acting Governor-General of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, after the death of Charles Antrobus and until the appointment of Dr. Frederick Ballantyne as Governor General, on June 2, 2002. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours/Overseas and Diplomatic List.

<doc id="521402" wikidata="Q7229115" url="?curid=521402" title="Popbitch">
<text>Popbitch is a weekly UK-based celebrity and pop music newsletter and associated dating website from the early 2000s. Much of the material for the newsletter comes from the Popbitch message boards, frequented by music industry insiders, gossips and the casually interested. The board has at various times been credited for celebrity rumours (both false and true) appearing in the press, and the coining of many expressions that have gone on to enjoy wider usage.

== History ==
The website was the first of many satirical and irreverent UK gossip sites that skirted the limits of defamation law. The uncompromising ethos of cruel humour gave it a feel somewhat similar to usenet gossip newsgroups.

Popbitch was founded, is owned and run by Neil Stevenson and Camilla Wright, both journalists. Wright is employed full-time to run Popbitch. Stevenson is still a director, but his active participation in the project has diminished. Originally published privately from a www.popbitch.demon.co.uk address, Popbitch has been published from popbitch.com since March 2000, and by Popdog Limited since 2001. Stevenson was employed by the British publishing house EMAP on various entertainment titles, including the celebrity magazine &quot;Heat&quot; and as editor of &quot;The Face&quot;.

== Editorial style of the newsletter ==
The newsletter is aimed principally at a British audience and is published weekly, usually on a Thursday. It usually contains celebrity-based stories relating to music, film, television and sport, with quirky stories from other fields.

The newsletter usually contains, in order:
* a short quote from a celebrity
* some advertising
* several multiple-paragraph stories separated by single-sentence stories or facts
* some advertising
* a section entitled &quot;Big questions&quot; with one or more allegations about unidentified celebrities presented in the form of questions
* a series of webpage links entitled &quot;Things To Make You Go Hmm&quot;
* predictions of the position of some artists in the UK singles chart for the week ahead
* some advertising
* some more advertising
* a &quot;Help Popbitch&quot; appeal for gossip or money or presents
* an &quot;End Bit&quot; section where contributors are thanked, usually by initials or messageboard identity
* the &quot;Old Jokes Home&quot; usually a topical joke
* and one or more web links headed &quot;Still Bored?&quot;
* some advertising

== Famous nicknames on Popbitch ==
* Fat Dancer (sometimes shortened to FD) = Robbie Williams (from a comment by Noel Gallagher, describing Williams as &quot;the fat dancer from Take That&quot;)
* ChazBaps = Billie Piper
* Derek and Victoria, Thick and Thin = The Beckhams
* Skeletor = Victoria Beckham
* Rhombus Face = Sophie Ellis-Bextor
* Jeremy ***** = Jeremy Clarkson
* Sir JingleJangle = Jimmy Savile

== Cultural impact ==
By 2003, Popbitch had moved from a niche-market publication to mainstream cultural knowledge, thanks in part to its role in assisting British tabloid newspapers with their entertainment coverage. It achieved frequent name-checks in newspaper &quot;diary&quot; columns, and from celebrities as diverse as Madonna and French and Saunders.

It played some part in popularising terms such as Croydon (or council) facelift, &quot;gak&quot; (meaning cocaine), and &quot;pramface&quot; (a term of abuse contracted from &quot;a face more suited to pushing a pram around a council estate&quot;).

It gained a reputation as being first with a number of celebrity-based stories. One poster reported David Beckham&#x27;s move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at least four months before sports pages picked up on the story — then stood by the story in the face of repeated denials. It was also the first to report on the name of Madonna&#x27;s son, Rocco.

Some of the contributors to the Popbitch messageboards have also become minor celebrities in their own right. When one, who posted as Reverend_Goatboy, died in July 2007, his death was noted in &quot;The Times&quot;.

== Controversy and criticism ==
The website was one of the first websites to detail accusations of necrophilia and child sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile during his lifetime.

False allegations against Jeremy Clarkson, a British TV celebrity, and David Beckham were published on the Popbitch messageboards by its users. This led to legal action against the site&#x27;s owners. The messageboard was closed and reopened with board members as editors. The editors have the ability to modify or delete anything libellous or &quot;not pop or bitch&quot;, and the board also employs automatic censors that prevent the names of certain celebrities from appearing. Despite these precautions Popbitch was once again in the news after being successfully sued by Max Beesley in March 2008 over an allegation about his personal life.

== Diversification ==
From mid-2007, Popbitch&#x27;s owners sought to broaden the appeal of the brand by launching Popbitch-themed and endorsed products. Camilla Wright said this diversification was necessary as, with simply a gossip website and email, it was &quot;harder to maintain a niche because everybody is doing it&quot;.

Among the first new sites launched was Popbets, a reality TV gambling site, in 2007, and this was followed in February 2008 by Radio Popbitch. Wright has also stated her aim to move into Popbitch-branded offline publishing, and web TV.

<text>Claude Nicollier (born 2 September 1944) is the first astronaut from Switzerland. He has flown on four Space Shuttle missions. His first spaceflight (STS-46) was in 1992, and his final spaceflight (STS-103) was in 1999. He took part in two servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope (called STS-61 and STS-103). During his final spaceflight he participated in a spacewalk, becoming the first European Space Agency astronaut to do so during a Space Shuttle mission (previous ESA astronauts conducted spacewalks aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, see List of spacewalks and moonwalks 1965–1999). In 2000 he was assigned to the Astronaut Office Extravehicular Activity Branch, while maintaining a position as Lead ESA Astronaut in Houston. Nicollier retired from ESA in April 2007.

He was appointed full professor of Spatial Technology at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne on 28 March 2007.

He was an expert board member of Swiss Space Systems, until the company&#x27;s dissolution.

==Early life and education==
Nicollier was born September 2, 1944. After graduating from the Gymnase de la Cité (high school) in Lausanne in 1962, he studied physics at the University of Lausanne and received a Licentiate degree in 1970. He then worked as a graduate scientist from 1970 to 1973 at the Institute of Astronomy at the university and at the Geneva Observatory, before obtaining a post Diploma degree in astrophysics from the University of Geneva in 1975. In parallel, he became a Swiss Air Force pilot in 1966, in the Fliegerstaffel 5 on Hawker Hunter where he holds a commission as captain, and has logged 5,600 hours flying time, including 4,000 hours in jet aircraft. Later, in 1988, he graduated as a test pilot from the Empire Test Pilot&#x27;s School in Boscombe Down, United Kingdom.

In 2004, he started teaching at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, and became a full professor in March 2007.

==Astronaut career==
Concurrently with his part-time research activities, he joined the Swiss Air Transport School in Zürich and became an airline pilot in 1974, assigned as a DC-9 pilot for Swissair. At the end of 1976, he accepted a Fellowship at the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Science Department at Noordwijk, Netherlands, where he worked as a research scientist in various airborne infrared astronomy programs. In July 1978, he was selected by ESA as a member of the first group of European astronauts. Under agreement between ESA and NASA, he joined NASA Astronaut Group 9 selected in May 1980 for astronaut training as a mission specialist. Unlike colleague Wubbo Ockels—who withdrew from training to focus on Spacelab and remained an ESA payload specialist—Nicollier became a mission specialist, the first non-American to become a full-time NASA astronaut.

Nicollier&#x27;s technical assignments in the Astronaut Office have included flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), participation in the development of retrieval techniques for the Tethered Satellite System (TSS), Remote Manipulator System (RMS), and International Space Station (ISS) robotics support. From the spring of 1996 to the end of 1998, he was head of the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch. From the year 2000 on, he was assigned to the Astronaut Office EVA (Extravehicular Activity) Branch, while maintaining a position as Lead ESA astronaut in Houston. Nicollier retired from ESA in April 2007.

He is a member of the Swiss Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the Swiss Air Force Officers Society (AVIA), and the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences and fellow of the British Interplanetary Society. He is also an honorary member of the Swiss Aero Club, the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects, and the Swiss Astronomy Day Society.

Nicollier has spent over 1000 hours in space (42 days, 12 hours and 5 minutes), including one space walk lasting 8 hours and 10 minutes. He served as mission specialist on four missions with four different space shuttles.

===STS-61-K===
His first spaceflight was planned to be STS-61-K, which had been scheduled for October 1986, but was cancelled following the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

===STS-46===
Nicollier&#x27;s first spaceflight was as a mission specialist on the 8-day Space Shuttle mission aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;, called STS-46, in 1992. The crew deployed the European Retrievable Carrier EURECA, as well as the Tethered Satellite System-1, which was a joint NASA and Italian Space Agency project.

===STS-61===
His second spaceflight was as a mission specialist on the 10-day mission aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot;, called STS-61, in 1993. It was the first mission to perform maintenance on the Hubble Space Telescope, which had been launched three years previously. The nature of this repair was to correct a 2 micrometer error in the lens, which caused significant distortion of the images taken by the telescope.

===STS-75===
In 1996 he took part in STS-75, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, which deployed TSS-1R, which was a follow-up mission to TSS-1 which had been deployed during STS-46.

===STS-103===

His final spaceflight was an eight-day mission aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, called STS-103, in 1999. It was the third servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. During this mission Nicollier participated in an 8-hour spacewalk; it was his first, and the first of any ESA astronaut during a Space Shuttle mission.

Following his astronaut career, he delivered a lecture on his experiences, “Revisiting Hubble,” at the first Starmus Festival in 2011 in the Canary Islands. The talk was published in the book &quot;Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Nicollier has received several awards and honors:

* Doctor Honoris Causa from Business School Lausanne (2011)
* Swiss Astronomy Award (2007)
* NASA Distinguished Service Medal (2001)
* Albert Einstein Medal (1998)
* NASA Space Flight Medals (1992, 1993, 1996, 1999)
* Prix d&#x27;honneur de la Fondation Pro Aero, Switzerland (1992)
* Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal from the International Aeronautical Federation (1994)
* Silver Medal from the Académie Nationale de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace, France (1994)
* Collier Trophy (awarded to the crew of STS-61) from the National Aeronautics Association (1994)
* Prix de l&#x27;Université de Lausanne (1994)
* Honorary doctorates from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, and the University of Geneva (both in 1994)
* International Space Hall of Fame (1997)

==Personal life==
He is widowed (Susana Perez of Monterrey, Mexico, died December 2007). Together they had two daughters.

==Other work==
Nicollier made a cameo appearances on the TV show &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Touchstone Television (Series 3, Episode 24, &quot;Reality Bytes&quot;).

<doc id="521411" wikidata="Q1057516" url="?curid=521411" title="Hank Hanegraaff">
<text>Hendrik &quot;Hank&quot; Hanegraaff (born 1950), also known as the &quot;Bible Answer Man&quot;, is an American Christian author and radio talk-show host. Formerly an evangelical Protestant, he joined the Eastern Orthodox Church in 2017. He is an outspoken figure within the Christian countercult movement, where he has established a reputation for his critiques of non-Christian religions, new religious movements, and cults, as well as heresy in Christianity. He is also an apologist on doctrinal and cultural issues.

==Career==

Prior to becoming a leading figure in the Christian countercult movement, Hanegraaff was closely affiliated with the ministry of D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Florida. During his association with Kennedy in the 1980s, he applied memory-based techniques (such as acrostic mnemonics) to help develop and spread strategies and methods for personal Christian evangelism. His work resembles memory dynamics techniques developed in speed-reading courses and in memory training programs used in some executive business courses.

During the late 1980s, Hanegraaff became associated with Walter Ralston Martin at the Christian Research Institute (CRI), the conservative Protestant countercult and apologetic ministry which Martin founded in 1960.

After Martin&#x27;s death from heart failure in June 1989, Hanegraaff became president of CRI. As part of his duties, Hanegraaff took over from Martin the role of anchorman on the radio program &quot;The Bible Answer Man&quot; and became a conference speaker and itinerant preacher in churches, where he pursued the general ministry charter of CRI.

The content of &quot;The Bible Answer Man&quot; show typically includes call-in questions from listeners about general Christian doctrine, biblical interpretation, and denominational particularities, as well as a regular special focus on a particular issue when a notable figure is a guest. A frequently treated special topic is Mormonism, with former Mormons appearing in studio as guests to speak from their experiences.

Shortly after the release of Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, he co-authored &quot;The Da Vinci Code: Fact or Fiction?&quot; with Lutheran historian and apologist Paul L. Maier. In 2013 he wrote &quot;Afterlife: What You Need To Know About Heaven, The Hereafter &amp; Near-Death Experiences&quot;, from Worthy Publishing.

Throughout the 1990s, Hanegraaff engaged in dialogue with Joseph Tkach Jr. and other leaders of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), now known as Grace Communion International (GCI). The WCG was founded in the 1930s by Herbert W. Armstrong, and had long been regarded as a cult by evangelicals, primarily for its denial of the Trinity and other traditional Christian doctrines. Following Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1986, the group re-evaluated many of its teachings, including the British Israel doctrine and various eschatological predictions. Hanegraaff was one of a handful of evangelical apologists, including Ruth A. Tucker, who assisted in the reforms. The biggest changes to ensure their acceptance among evangelicals were in embracing the doctrines of the Trinity and of salvation by grace through faith.

===2007 defamation suit===
Hanegraaff sued longtime critic William Alnor for alleging that Hanegraaff&#x27;s fundraising was under investigation for mail fraud. The allegation was based on an incident of misdirected mail, which was followed by a January 2005 CRI fundraising letter saying the error might have caused &quot;perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars&quot; in donations to be lost. The defamation lawsuit was thrown out based on California&#x27;s anti-SLAPP statute. The court found that although Alnor&#x27;s statements regarding a mail fraud investigation were false, Hanegraaff was unlikely to prove &quot;actual malice.&quot;

==Books==

===&quot;Christianity in Crisis&quot;===
In his 1993 book &quot;Christianity in Crisis&quot;, Hanegraaff charged the Word of Faith movement with heretical teachings, saying that many of the Word of Faith groups were cults, and that those who knowingly accepted the movement&#x27;s theology were &quot;clearly embracing a different gospel, which is in reality no gospel at all.&quot;

===&quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot;===
Hanegraaff revisited some of the same issues in his 1997 book &quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot;, in which he rejected the claims of many Charismatic teachers such as Rodney Howard Browne concerning what became known as the Toronto Blessing. The Toronto Blessing was associated with the Vineyard church located near the Toronto Airport, and was marked by spontaneous and sustained outbursts of bodily phenomena such as laughter, shaking, bouncing, and &quot;resting in the Spirit&quot;. A different but related set of phenomena and claims subsequently emanated from churches in Pensacola, Florida, and became known as the Brownsville Revival.

One of the book&#x27;s primary arguments is that many ostensible &quot;manifestations of the Spirit&quot; in Pentecostal, Charismatic, and Neo-Charismatic or &quot;third-wave&quot; affiliated churches are caused by psychological manipulation of parishioners, and that many of the &quot;signs and wonders&quot; claimed by these churches are fraudulent or result from manipulation, peer pressure, subtle suggestions, altered states of consciousness from repetitive chanting or singing, or expectations of supernatural events. Hanegraaff argues that many of the practices within these movements are not biblically sanctioned or appropriate and are based on misinterpretations of scripture. He contends that these movements rely too much on subjective experiences or feelings.

Beverley, professor of theology and ethics at Tyndale Seminary (formerly Ontario Theological Seminary) in Toronto, Canada, reviewed &quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot; in &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, and wrote that while the book &quot;exposes some real excesses and imbalances in the current charismatic renewal movements&quot;, it is a &quot;misleading, simplistic, and harmful book, marred by faulty logic [and] outdated and limited research&quot;.

Hanegraaff responded on equip.org, the CRI website, by arguing that Beverley had received funding from the Vineyard in the past and that he was aligned with them generally. Hanegraaff implied that Beverley had been compensated to write a &quot;hit piece&quot; for &quot;Christianity Today&quot;.

===&quot;Afterlife&quot;===
In 2013, Hanegraaff published the book &quot;Afterlife: What You Need To Know About Heaven, The Hereafter &amp; Near-Death Experiences&quot;, where he addresses questions that have been raised during his radio show regarding heaven and eternal life.

==Personal life==
Hanegraaff was born in the Netherlands and raised in the United States from childhood. He and his wife Kathy have twelve children. In the mid-2000s, seeking to save money on ministry operations, Hanegraaff and his wife moved from Southern California to Charlotte, North Carolina. In subsequent years Hanegraaff became increasingly discontented with evangelicalism; a period of research and seeking led him to the Eastern Orthodox Church. On Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, together with his wife Kathy and two of their sons, he was received by chrismation into St. Nektarios Greek Orthodox Church in Charlotte, a parish within the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Apparently the largest negative reaction to his conversion was that his syndicated radio program was dropped by the Bott Radio Network, which operates at least 119 Christian radio stations in at least 13 states. Some other radio stations did the same.

In 2017 Hanegraaff revealed that he has mantle cell lymphoma.

<doc id="521415" wikidata="Q4682174" url="?curid=521415" title="Aden Ridgeway">
<text>Aden Derek Ridgeway (born 18 September 1962) is an Australian former politician. He was a member of the Australian Senate for New South Wales from 1999 to 2005, representing the Australian Democrats. During his term he was the only Aboriginal member of the Australian Parliament. He is currently a spokesperson for Recognise, the movement to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples in the Australian Constitution.

==Early life and education ==
Aden Derek Ridgeway was born on the Bellwood Aboriginal reserve in Nambucca Heads (close to Macksville, New South Wales), as one of the Gumbaynggirr people. 

He was educated at Bellwood and St John&#x27;s College, Woodlawn in Lismore. 

== Early career ==
After leaving school in Year 11, he worked as a boilermaker. He then became involved in the public service, engaging in a number of careers, including being a park ranger, and working in several New South Wales government departments.

In 1990, Ridgeway was elected onto the first ATSIC Sydney Regional Council, a position in which he served two terms of office. 

In 1994, he became the Executive Director of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council. He continued in this position until 1998. Also in 1994, he became a trustee of the Australian Museum Trust.

He became a Member of the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales from 1995.

He was the Director of the Public Service Board Staff Credit Union from 1996 to 1998.

==Political career==
Ridgeway joined the Australian Democrats in 1990. During 1997–98 he served as the state policy convener for the New South Wales Branch of the Democrats. He was subsequently selected in the first position on the Democrats&#x27; Senate ticket at the 1998 election.

He has served on a number of parliamentary and senate committees.

In April 2001, Ridgeway was elected deputy leader of the Democrats, after Natasha Stott Despoja toppled Meg Lees in a leadership spill.

Ridgeway continued as deputy leader until August 2002, when along with fellow senators John Cherry, Lyn Allison and Andrew Murray, he succeeded in forcing Stott Despoja to resign. It was widely tipped that he would succeed her as leader. However, the media did not portray the spill kindly, labelling them the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;.

Ridgeway was expected to be appointed interim leader however, in a surprise decision, the party&#x27;s National Executive installed Brian Greig as interim leader due to the role Ridgeway played in forcing the resignation of Stott Despoja. He did not contest the subsequent leadership ballot, at which Andrew Bartlett defeated Brian Greig. He was technically leader between Natasha Stott Despoja&#x27;s resignation and the appointment of Brian Greig as interim leader.

Ridgeway also stood down as deputy leader and was replaced by Lyn Allison. He did not contest the leadership and stood down as deputy leader as he felt the National Executive&#x27;s decision not to appoint him as interim leader was a reflection on him in a leadership position.

He remained in the Senate, being particularly active on issues of Indigenous Affairs and reconciliation. He lost his seat in the 2004 election, along with Cherry, Lees (who had since left the party), and Greig. His term expired on 30 June 2005.

==Post-political career==
Ridgeway received the NAIDOC Person of the Year award in 2005 and was made chair of the National NAIDOC Committee, a role that he occupied until 2008.

In May 2006, Ridgeway was selected as the new host of ABC Television&#x27;s &quot;Message Stick&quot; program. He was the inaugural chairman of Indigenous Tourism Australia. 

In 2007, Ridgeway partnered with Tim Powell of Cox Inall Communications to establish Cox Inall Ridgeway, a social change agency that seeks to disrupt disadvantage in Indigenous communities. The agency is based on the lands of the Eora Nation (Walsh Bay, New South Wales), and Ridgeway is currently a partner in the business.

Ridgeway was Chairman of Bangarra Dance Theatre from 1998 to 2010.

In February 2013, Ridgeway was announced as a spokesperson for the Recognise campaign, a movement to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. In May 2013, he was one of a number of Aboriginal leaders to start the &quot;Journey to Recognition&quot;, a relay across Australia to raise awareness of the issue.

On 4 March 2020, it was announced that Ridgeway would be a member of the Local and Regional Co-Design Group for the Indigenous voice to government, set up in late 2019.

, Ridgeway is on the board of the Muurrbay Aboriginal Language and Culture Co-operative, a research and teaching centre for a group of Aboriginal languages in New South Wales, in Nambucca.

<doc id="521423" wikidata="Q130786" url="?curid=521423" title="Viktor Suvorov">
<text>Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun (; ; born 20 April 1947), known by his pseudonym of Viktor Suvorov (), is a former Soviet GRU officer who is the author of non-fiction books about World War II, the GRU and the Soviet Army, as well as fictional books about the same and related subjects.

After defecting to the United Kingdom in 1978, Suvorov began his writing career, publishing his first books in the 1980s about his own experiences and the structure of the Soviet military, intelligence, and secret police. He writes in Russian with a number of his books translated into English, including his semi-autobiographical &quot;The Liberators&quot; (1981). In the USSR, according to Suvorov and according to an interview with the former head of the GRU, he was sentenced to death in absentia.

In his military history books, he offers an alternative view of the role of the USSR in World War II; the first and most well-known book on this topic being &quot;Icebreaker: Who started the Second World War?&quot;. The proposed concept and the methods of its substantiation have caused numerous discussions and criticism in historical and social circles. In &quot;Icebreaker&quot;, &quot;M Day&quot; and several follow-up books Suvorov argued that Joseph Stalin planned to use Nazi Germany as a proxy (the &quot;Icebreaker&quot;) against the West. The books are based on his personal analysis of Soviet military investments, diplomatic maneuvers, Politburo speeches and other circumstantial evidence.

Suvorov also wrote a number of fiction books about the Soviet Army, military intelligence and the pre-war history of the USSR. The trilogy &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Choice&quot; and &quot;Snake-eater&quot; was a bestseller and was approached for movie adaptations. According to &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot;, an online newspaper, the circulation of some of Suvorov&#x27;s books exceeds a million copies.

==Early years==

Suvorov, born Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun, comes from a military family of mixed Ukrainian-Russian descent; his father, Bogdan Vasilyevich Rezun, was a veteran of WWII and a Ukrainian, while his mother Vera Spiridonovna Rezun (Gorevalova) is Russian. According to his own statements, Suvorov considers himself, his wife and children to be Ukrainians. He was born in the village of Barabash, Primorsky Krai; raised in Ukraine&#x27;s Cherkasy, where his father served. The family subsequently settled in Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic after his father&#x27;s retirement.

According to Suvorov, he went to first grade in the village of Slavyanka (Primorsky Territory), then studied in the village of Barabash. In 1957, after graduating on four classes, at the age of 11 he entered the Suvorov Military School in Voronezh (from 1958 to 1963). In 1963, the school was disbanded, and the students, including Rezun, were transferred to the Kalinin (now Tver) Suvorov Military School (from 1963 to 1965). In 1965, Rezun graduated from said school and was admitted without examinations to the second year of the Kyiv Higher Combined Arms Command School then named after General Mikhail Frunze (now Odesa Military Academy).

== Prague Spring invasion ==

In 1968, Suvorov graduated with honours from the Frunze Red Banner Higher Military Command School in Kyiv. At the same year, he served in Chernivtsi as a tank platoon commander with the 145th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, 66th Guards Training Motor Rifle Division, of the Carpathian Military District in Ukraine, participating in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Operation Danube. This experience is narrated in his 1981 book &quot;The Liberators: My Life in the Soviet Army&quot;.

The book was Suvorov&#x27;s first after his defection and in it he narrates his eyewitness account of the invasion, recounting the daily life within the Soviet Army. He points to deficiencies in readiness and in mindset. Suvorov mentions that middle-ranking officers struggled to impress their superiors, something that does not contribute to military effectiveness or discipline – instead fostering on officers a behavior of cunning and deceit in order to climb the ranks.

At the age of 19 he was admitted to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). From 1970 to 1971 he was an officer in the intelligence department of the headquarters of the Volga Military District (in the city of Kuibyshev), and later with the 808th Independent Army Reconnaissance Company (&quot;Spetsnaz&quot;). In 1970 he became a member of the nomenclature (nomenklatura) of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In this position he came under the patronage of the commander of the Carpathian Military District, Lieutenant General of Tank Forces (later General of the Army) Gennady Obaturov. This general was known for suppressing anti-communist uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and later Czechoslovakia in 1968 with ruthless efficiency, for which Obaturov received the Order of the Red Banner.

== Espionage in Geneva and defection ==

=== Geneva station ===
From 1971 to 1974, Suvorov studied at the Military Diplomatic Academy, known as &quot;the Conservatory&quot;, located in Moscow. The Academy trained officers for work abroad as intelligence operatives or &quot;scouts&quot; ( in the Russian language). These worked often &quot;under diplomatic cover&quot; (&quot;jackets&quot;, in the jargon of Soviet intelligence operatives), and also as &quot;illegals&quot;, meaning intelligence operatives not under diplomatic cover or (quasi-declared) commercial cover.

For four years, Suvorov worked in the Geneva GRU as an employee of the legal residency of military intelligence under the cover of the Permanent Mission of the USSR at the European United Nations Office at Geneva. According to the autobiographical book &quot;Aquarium&quot;, he received the rank of major while working in residency. The same title was named in an interview of 1992 with the newspaper by then head of the GRU, Colonel general Yevgeny Timokhin.

=== Defection ===
On 10 June 1978 he disappeared from his Geneva apartment with his wife and two children. According to Suvorov himself, he made contact with British intelligence because the Geneva station wanted to make him a &quot;scapegoat&quot; of a major failure. On 28 June 1978 British newspapers reported that Rezun was in England with his family. At the time, he was married to Tatiana Korzh. The couple had a son, Aleksandr, and a daughter, Oksana. They were smuggled out of Switzerland to Britain by British intelligence. There Suvorov worked as an intelligence analyst for the government and as a lecturer.

Since 1981, he has been writing under the pseudonym Viktor Suvorov, having written his first three books in English: &quot;The Liberators&quot;, &quot;Inside the Soviet Army&quot;, and &quot;Inside Soviet Military Intelligence&quot;. The author explains the choice of pseudonym by the fact that his publisher recommended that he choose a Russian surname of three syllables, evoking a slight &quot;military&quot; association among Western readers. According to Viktor himself, he teaches tactics and military history at a British military academy and lives in Bristol.

== Publications ==
=== Non-fiction ===
Suvorov drew on his experience and research to write non-fiction books in Russian about the Soviet Army, military intelligence, and special forces. He publishes these works under the pseudonym &quot;Viktor Suvorov.&quot;

*&quot;The Liberators&quot;, includes his eyewitness account about the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet forces
*&quot;Inside the Soviet Army&quot;, 
*&quot;Inside Soviet Military Intelligence&quot; 
*&quot;Aquarium&quot;, his memoir, and 
*&quot;Spetsnaz&quot;, about Special Forces units

* &quot;Control&quot;

* &quot;Snake-eater&quot; (2010)
=== Movies ===
Suvorov was in participant the movie The Soviet Story (2008).

== Works about World War II ==

Suvorov has written ten books about the outbreak of the Nazi-Soviet War in 1941 and the circumstances related to it. The first such work was &quot;Icebreaker&quot; (1989), followed by &quot;M Day&quot;, &quot;The Last Republic&quot;, &quot;Cleansing&quot;, &quot;Suicide&quot;, &quot;The Shadow of Victory&quot;, &quot;I Take it Back&quot;, &quot;The Last Republic II&quot;, &quot;The Chief Culprit&quot;, and &quot;Defeat&quot;.

In the &quot;Icebreaker&quot;, &quot;M Day&quot; and several follow-up books Suvorov argued that Stalin planned to use Nazi Germany as a proxy (the “Icebreaker”) against the West. For this reason, Stalin provided significant material and political support to Adolf Hitler, while at the same time preparing the Red Army to &quot;liberate&quot; the whole of Europe from Nazi occupation. Suvorov argued that Hitler had lost World War II from the time when he attacked Poland: not only was he going to war with the powerful Allies, but it was only a matter of time before the Soviet Union would seize the opportune moment to attack him from the rear. According to Suvorov, Hitler decided to direct a preemptive strike at the Soviet Union, while Stalin&#x27;s forces were redeploying from a defensive to an offensive posture in June 1941. Although Hitler had an important initial tactical advantage, that was strategically hopeless because he subjected the Nazis to having to fight on two fronts. At the end of the war, Stalin achieved only some of his initial objectives by establishing Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, China and North Korea. According to Suvorov, this made Stalin the primary winner of World War II, even though he was not satisfied by the outcome, having intended to establish Soviet domination over the whole continent of Europe.

Most historians agreed that the geopolitical differences between the Soviet Union and the Axis made war inevitable, and that Stalin had made extensive preparations for war and exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage. However, there was a debate among historians as to whether Joseph Stalin planned to attack Axis forces in Eastern Europe in the summer of 1941. A number of historians, such as Gabriel Gorodetsky and David Glantz disputed or rejected this claim. But it received some support from others, such as Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov, and Vladimir Nevezhin.

<text>Paul Ekman (born February 15, 1934) is an American psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco who is a pioneer in the study of emotions and their relation to facial expressions. He was ranked 59th out of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the twentieth century in 2002 by the &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot;.

His empirical and theoretical work helped to restart the study of emotion and non-verbal communication in the field of psychology, and introduced new quantitative frameworks which researchers could use to do so. He also carried out important early work on the physiology of emotions.

==Biography==
=== Childhood ===
Paul Ekman was born in 1934 in Washington, D.C., and grew up in a Jewish family in New Jersey, Washington, Oregon, and California. His father was a pediatrician and his mother was an attorney. His sister, Joyce Steinhart, is a psychoanalytic psychologist who, before her retirement, practiced in New York City.

Ekman originally wanted to be a psychotherapist, but when he was drafted into the army in 1958 he found that research could change army routines, making them more humane. This experience converted him from wanting to be a psychotherapist to wanting to be a researcher, in order to help as many people as possible.

=== Education ===
At the age of 15, without graduating from high school, Paul Ekman enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he completed three years of undergraduate study. During his time in Chicago, he was fascinated by group therapy sessions and understanding group dynamics. Notably, his classmates at Chicago included writer Susan Sontag, film director Mike Nichols, and actress Elaine May.

He then studied for two years at New York University (NYU), earning his BA in 1954. The subject of his first research project, under the direction of his NYU professor, Margaret Tresselt, was an attempt to develop a test of how people would respond to group therapy.

Next, Ekman was accepted into the Adelphi University graduate program for clinical psychology. While working for his master&#x27;s degree, Ekman was awarded a predoctoral research fellowship from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1955. His Master&#x27;s thesis was focused on facial expression and body movement he had begun to study in 1954. Ekman eventually went on to receive his Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Adelphi University in 1958, after a one-year internship at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute.

=== Military service ===
Ekman was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958 to serve two years as soon as his internship at Langley Porter was finished. He served as first lieutenant-chief psychologist, at Fort Dix, New Jersey, where he did research on army stockades and psychological changes during infantry basic training.

=== Career ===

Upon completion of military service in 1960, he accepted a position as a research associate with Leonard Krasner at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital, working on a grant focused on the operant conditioning of verbal behavior in psychiatric patients. Ekman also met anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1960 who was on the staff of the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital. Five years later, Gregory Bateson gave Paul Ekman motion picture films taken in Bali in the mid-1930s to help Ekman with cross-cultural studies of expression and gesture.

From 1960 to 1963, Ekman was supported by a post doctoral fellowship from NIMH. He submitted his first research grant through San Francisco State College with himself as the principal investigator (PI) at the young age of 29. He received this grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1963 to study nonverbal behaviour. This award would be continuously renewed for the next 40 years and would pay his salary until he was offered a professorship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1972.

Encouraged by his college friend and teacher Silvan S. Tomkins, Ekman shifted his focus from body movement to facial expressions. He wrote his most famous book, &quot;Telling Lies&quot;, and published it in 1985. The 4th edition is still in print. He retired in 2004 as professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). From 1960 to 2004 he also worked at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute on a limited basis consulting on various clinical cases.

After retiring from the University of California, San Francisco, Paul Ekman founded the Paul Ekman Group (PEG) and Paul Ekman International.

=== Media ===
In 2001, Ekman collaborated with John Cleese for the BBC documentary series &quot;The Human Face&quot;.

His work is frequently referred to in the TV series &quot;Lie to Me&quot;. Dr. Lightman is based on Paul Ekman, and Ekman served as a scientific adviser for the series; he read and edited the scripts and sent video clip-notes of facial expressions for the actors to imitate. While Ekman has written 15 books, the series &quot;Lie to Me&quot; has more effectively brought Ekman&#x27;s research into people&#x27;s homes.

He has also collaborated with Pixar&#x27;s film director and animator Pete Docter in preparation of his 2015 film &quot;Inside Out&quot;. Ekman also wrote a parent&#x27;s guide to using &quot;Inside Out&quot; to help parents talk with their children about emotion, which can be found on his personal website.

=== Influence ===
He was named one of the top Time 100 most influential people in the May 11, 2009 edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He was also ranked fifteenth among the most influential psychologists of the 21st century in 2014 by the journal Archives of Scientific Psychology. He is currently on the Editorial Board of Greater Good magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley. His contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

==Research work==

===Measuring nonverbal communication===
Ekman&#x27;s interest in nonverbal communication led to his first publication in 1957, describing how difficult it was to develop ways of empirically measuring nonverbal behaviour. He chose the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute, the psychiatry department of the University of California Medical School, for his clinical internship partly because Jurgen Ruesch and Weldon Kees had recently published a book called &quot;Nonverbal Communication&quot; (1956).

Ekman then focused on developing techniques for measuring nonverbal communication. He found that facial muscular movements that created facial expressions could be reliably identified through empirical research. He also found that human beings are capable of making over 10,000 facial expressions; only 3,000 relevant to emotion. Psychologist Silvan Tomkins convinced Ekman to extend his studies of nonverbal communication from body movement to the face, helping him design his classic cross-cultural emotion recognition studies.

===Emotions as universal categories===
In &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; published in 1872, Charles Darwin theorized that emotions were evolved traits universal to the human species. However, the prevalent belief during the 1950s, particularly among anthropologists, was that facial expressions and their meanings were determined through behavioral learning processes. A prominent advocate of the latter perspective was the anthropologist Margaret Mead, who had traveled to different countries examining how cultures communicated using nonverbal behavior.

Through a series of studies, Ekman found a high agreement across members of diverse Western and Eastern literate cultures on selecting emotional labels that fit facial expressions. Expressions he found to be universal included those indicating wrath, grossness, fear, joy, loneliness, and shock. Findings on contempt were less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized. Working with Wallace V. Friesen, Ekman demonstrated that the findings extended to preliterate Fore tribesmen in Papua New Guinea, whose members could not have learned the meaning of expressions from exposure to media depictions of emotion. Ekman and Friesen then demonstrated that certain emotions were exhibited with very specific display rules, culture-specific prescriptions about who can show which emotions to whom and when. These display rules could explain how cultural differences may conceal the universal effect of expression.

In the 1990s, Ekman proposed an expanded list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions that are not all encoded in facial muscles. The newly included emotions are: Amusement, Contempt, Contentment, Embarrassment, Excitement, Guilt, Pride in achievement, Relief, Satisfaction, Sensory pleasure, and Shame.

===Visual depictions of facial actions for studying emotion===
Ekman&#x27;s famous test of emotion recognition was the Pictures of Facial Affect (POFA) stimulus set published in 1976. Consisting of 110 black and white images of Caucasian actors portraying the six universal emotions plus neutral expressions, the POFA has been used to study emotion recognition rates in normal and psychiatric populations around the world. Ekman used these stimuli in his original cross-cultural research. Many researchers favor the POFA because these photographs have been rated by large normative groups in different cultures. In response to critics, however, Ekman eventually released a more culturally diverse set of stimuli called the Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion (JACFEE).

By 1978, Ekman and Friesen had finalized and developed the Facial Action Coding System. FACS is an anatomically based system for describing all observable facial movement for every emotion. Each observable component of facial movement is called an action unit or AU and all facial expressions can be decomposed into their constituent core AUs. An update of this tool came in the early 2000s.

Other tools have been developed, including the MicroExpressions Training Tool (METT), which can help individuals identify more subtle emotional expressions that occur when people try to suppress their emotions. Application of this tool includes helping people with Asperger&#x27;s or autism to recognize emotional expressions in their everyday interactions. The Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT) teaches recognition of very small, micro signs of emotion. These are very tiny expressions, sometimes registering in only part of the face, or when the expression is shown across the entire face, but is very small. Subtle expressions occur for many reasons, for example, the emotion experienced may be very slight or the emotion may be just beginning.

Paul Ekman International was established in 2010 by the EIA Group based on a partnership between Cliff Lansley and Paul Ekman to deliver emotional skills and deception detection workshops around the world.

===Detecting deception===
Ekman has contributed to the study of social aspects of lying, why people lie, and why people are often unconcerned with detecting lies. He first became interested in detecting lies while completing his clinical work. As detailed in Ekman&#x27;s &quot;Telling Lies&quot;, a patient he was involved in treating denied that she was suicidal in order to leave the hospital. Ekman began to review videotaped interviews to study people&#x27;s facial expressions while lying. In a research project along with Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, called the Wizards Project (previously named the Diogenes Project), Ekman reported on facial &quot;microexpressions&quot; which could be used to assist in lie detection. After testing a total of 20,000 people from all walks of life, he found only 50 people who had the ability to spot deception without any formal training. These &quot;naturals&quot; are also known as &quot;Truth Wizards&quot;, or wizards of deception detection from demeanor.

In his profession, he also uses oral signs of lying. When interviewed about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he mentioned that he could detect that former President Bill Clinton was lying because he used distancing language.

==Contributions==
In his 1993 paper in the psychology journal &quot;American Psychologist&quot;, Ekman describes nine direct contributions that his research on facial expression has made to the understanding of emotion. Highlights include:
* Consideration of both nature and nurture: Emotion is now viewed as a physiological phenomenon influenced by our cultural and learning experiences.
* Emotion-specific physiology: Ekman led the way by trying to find discrete psychophysiological differences across emotions. A number of researchers continue to search for emotion-specific autonomic and central nervous system activations. With the advent of neuroimaging techniques, a topic of intense interest revolves around how specific emotions relate to physiological activations in certain brain areas. Ekman laid the groundwork for the future field of affective neuroscience.
* An examination of events that precede emotions: Ekman&#x27;s finding that voluntarily making one of the universal facial expressions can generate the physiology and some of the subjective experience of emotion provided some difficulty for some of the earlier theoretical conceptualizations of experiencing emotions.
* Considering emotions as families: Ekman &amp; Friesen (1978) found not one expression for each emotion, but a variety of related but visually different expressions. For example, the authors reported 60 variations of the anger expression which share core configurational properties and distinguish themselves clearly from the families of fearful expressions, disgust expressions, and so on. Variations within a family likely reflect the intensity of the emotion, how the emotion is controlled, whether it is simulated or spontaneous, and the specifics of the event that provoked the emotion.

==Criticism==
Most credibility-assessment researchers agree that untrained people are unable to visually detect lies. 
The application of part of Ekman&#x27;s work to airport security via the Transportation Security Administration&#x27;s &quot;Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques&quot; (SPOT) program has been criticized for not having been put through controlled scientific tests. A 2007 report on SPOT referring to untrained people stated that &quot;simply put, people (including professional lie-catchers with extensive experience of assessing veracity) would achieve similar hit rates if they flipped a coin&quot;. Since controlled scientific tests typically involve people playing the part of terrorists, Ekman says those people are unlikely to have the same emotions as actual terrorists.

Field research by the EIA Group documented empirical testing of the impact of behavioral analysis in an airport environment by having a small group of trained and untrained subjects identify people from yet another group who had to bring unauthorized items through security. But the white paper is not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific paper, and had only two exercises of an airport security shift-length with the control group and two with the trained group, with about 20 participants total.

The methodology used by Ekman and O&#x27;Sullivan in their recent work on &quot;Truth Wizards&quot; has also received criticism on the basis of validation.

Other criticisms of Ekman&#x27;s work are based on experimental and naturalistic studies by several other emotion psychologists that did not find evidence in support of Ekman&#x27;s proposed taxonomy of discrete emotions and discrete facial expression.

Methodological criticisms of Ekman&#x27;s work focus on the essentially circular and tautological nature of his experiments, in which test subjects were shown selected photographs of &quot;basic emotions,&quot; and then asked to match them with the same set of concepts used in their production. Ekman showed photographs selected from over 3000 pictures of individuals asked to simulate emotions, from which he edited to contain &quot;those which showed only the pure display of a single affect,&quot; using no control and subject only to Ekman&#x27;s intuition. If Ekman felt a photograph did not show the correct &quot;pure&quot; emotion, he excluded it.

Ekman received hostility from some anthropologists at meetings of the American Psychological Association and the American Anthropological Association from 1967 to 1969. He recounted that, as he was reporting his findings on universality of expression, one anthropologist tried to stop him from finishing by shouting that his ideas were fascist. He compares this to another incident when he was accused of being racist by an activist for claiming that Black expressions are not different from White expressions. In 1975, Margaret Mead, an anthropologist, wrote against Ekman for doing &quot;improper anthropology&quot;, and for disagreeing with Ray Birdwhistell&#x27;s claim opposing universality. Ekman wrote that, while many people agreed with Birdwhistell then, most came to accept his own findings over the next decade.
However, some anthropologists continued to suggest that emotions are not universal. Ekman argued that there has been no quantitative data to support the claim that emotions are culture specific. In his 1993 discussion of the topic, Ekman states that there is no instance in which 70% or more of one cultural group select one of the six universal emotions while another culture group labels the same expression as another universal emotion.

Ekman criticized the tendency of psychologists to base their conclusions on surveys of college students. Hank Campbell quotes Ekman saying at the &quot;Being Human&quot; conference, &quot;We basically have a science of undergraduates.&quot; Ekman&#x27;s own studies have used freshman college students as the subject group, comparing their results with those of illiterate subjects from New Guinea.

Ekman has refused to submit his more recent work to peer-review, claiming that revealing the details of his work might reveal state secrets and endanger security. Critics assert that this is instead an attempt to shield his work from methodological criticisms within experimental psychology, even as his public and popular visibility has grown.
