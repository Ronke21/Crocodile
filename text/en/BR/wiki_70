<text>Edward Paul Sheringham (born 2 April 1966) is an English football manager and former player. He played as a forward, mostly as a second striker, in a 24-year professional career. Sheringham was part of the Manchester United team that won the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999. He scored the equalising goal and provided the assist for the club&#x27;s winning goal in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final against Bayern Munich that sealed it, with both goals coming in injury time of the second half.

Sheringham began his career at Millwall, where he scored 111 goals between 1983 and 1991, and is the club&#x27;s second all-time leading scorer. He left to join First Division Nottingham Forest. A year later, Sheringham scored Forest&#x27;s first ever Premier League goal, and was signed by Tottenham Hotspur. After five seasons at Spurs, Sheringham joined Manchester United where he won three Premier League titles, the FA Cup, the UEFA Champions League, the Intercontinental Cup and the FA Charity Shield. In 2001, he was named both the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.

After leaving Manchester United at the end of the 2000–01 season, Sheringham re-joined Tottenham Hotspur, where he was a losing finalist in the 2001–02 Football League Cup. He spent one season at newly promoted Portsmouth, scoring the club&#x27;s first Premier League goal, before joining West Ham United, where he helped the club gain promotion from the 2004–05 Football League Championship. The following season, Sheringham appeared for West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup final, becoming the third-oldest player to appear in an FA Cup final.

Sheringham is currently the thirteenth-highest goalscorer in the history of the Premier League with 146 goals, and is the competition&#x27;s 34th-highest appearance maker. He holds the record as the oldest outfield player to appear in a Premier League match (40 years, 272 days) and the oldest player to score in a Premier League match (40 years, 268 days). He was capped 51 times for the England national team, scoring 11 times, and played in the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 1996 UEFA European Championship. He retired from competitive football at the end of the 2007–08 season with Colchester United, at the age of 42. He has since managed League Two club Stevenage, and ATK of the Indian Super League.

==Club career==

===Millwall===
Sheringham began his professional career at Millwall in 1982 at the age of 16, after impressing a scout when playing for non-league club Leytonstone &amp; Ilford during a youth team game against Millwall. He was signed up, initially as an apprentice and scored on only his second appearance for the club in a match away at Bournemouth in January 1984. After being loaned out by the club twice in 1985 to Aldershot and later a Swedish side, Djurgården, he quickly became a first choice selection at Millwall and during the late 1980s formed a striking partnership with Tony Cascarino. He was the club&#x27;s top goalscorer in four seasons (1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89 and 1990–91) and played in every game of the season twice, in 1986–87 and 1990–91.

The 1987–88 season saw the club promoted to the First Division, then the highest tier of English league football, for the first time. Sheringham scored the first goal in Millwall&#x27;s first home game in Division One. Millwall briefly topped the table at the start of October 1988 and the goals of Sheringham (15) and Cascarino (15) kept Millwall in the top four for most of the season before fading after Easter to finish in 10th position. Sheringham said in his autobiography: &quot;It was a crazy exhilarating time. There we were, little Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. Everybody said it couldn&#x27;t last and of course it couldn&#x27;t and it didn&#x27;t, but we gave them all a good run for their money. We were beating the best teams when we shouldn&#x27;t and getting away draws to which we had no right.&quot;

Millwall&#x27;s spell in the top flight was not to last as they were relegated in the following season, finishing bottom of the Division after briefly topping the table again early in the season. Sheringham was again top scorer for Millwall with twelve goals, having missed ten league games through injury. The club had an opportunity to bounce straight back up at the end of the 1990–91 season, reaching the semi-finals of the Division Two play-offs, but they were beaten by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and remained in the Second Division. Sheringham&#x27;s outstanding form during the 1990–91 season saw him finish as the league&#x27;s highest scorer with 37 goals, a haul which included four hat-tricks. With Millwall failing to return to the top flight, a departure for Sheringham looked inevitable. In his final season at Millwall, Sheringham broke all of the club&#x27;s goalscoring records, scoring a total of 111 goals in all competitions in his eight years at the club. He was Millwall&#x27;s all-time leading scorer until 2009.

===Nottingham Forest===
The 25-year-old Sheringham was sold to Nottingham Forest in a £2 million deal in July 1991, to play alongside Nigel Clough. He did well for Forest and helped them finish eighth in the First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, as well as to reach the League Cup final, where they lost to Manchester United. Sheringham scored Forest&#x27;s first Premier League goal, against Liverpool, in August 1992 (which was also the first ever live goal shown on Sky Sports) but a week later he was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for £2.1 million. Forest went on to be relegated in 1992–93, in part due to having failed to adequately replace Sheringham in attack.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Sheringham had a successful start to his career at the club by being the Premier League&#x27;s top goalscorer in its inaugural season, scoring 22 goals (21 with Tottenham and one with Forest). His strike partners at White Hart Lane included Gordon Durie, Ronny Rosenthal, Jürgen Klinsmann and finally Chris Armstrong. In the 1993–94 season, he was Tottenham&#x27;s top scorer with 14 Premier League goals but played in just 19 games due to injury and this impacted negatively on Tottenham&#x27;s league form. Spurs finished 15th and were not completely safe from relegation until the penultimate game of the season. They have not finished lower than this ever since.

The following season was better, as he helped Spurs finish seventh in the Premier League and reach the semi-final of the FA Cup, just missing out on European football for the 1995–96 season.

Jürgen Klinsmann, who partnered Sheringham during the 1994–95 season, was later quoted as claiming that Sheringham was the most intelligent strike partner he had ever had.

Sheringham was hugely popular with the Tottenham fans and by the mid-1990s was firmly established as one of the most highly rated strikers in the Premier League. However, despite his prolific strike rate by the end of the 1996–97 season,he was 31 years old and had yet to win a major trophy in a career which had so far spanned 15 years; many pundits considered him past his best and likely to finish his career without major honours.

===Manchester United===
In June 1997, Sheringham agreed to join Manchester United in a £3.5 million deal. There was a significant gap upfront following the unexpected early retirement of the iconic Eric Cantona. His first competitive game for the club was against Chelsea in the 1997 FA Charity Shield which United won on penalties. His first league outing was against his former employers, Tottenham, at White Hart Lane. Throughout the game, Sheringham suffered jeers and boos from his former fans, who had been angered by the fact that Sheringham had accused Tottenham of lacking ambition when he made his transfer. In the 60th minute with the score at 0–0, Sheringham missed a penalty, although ended up on the winning side as two late goals gave United the win.

Sheringham scored 14 goals in all competitions and formed a good partnership with Andy Cole but the 1997–98 season ended without the league title. Towards the end of the season, during a game at Bolton Wanderers, an incident occurred that furthered the animosity with fellow striker Andy Cole. When Bolton scored, Sheringham blamed Cole, his strike partner and Cole then refused to talk to him. The breakdown in their relationship was never resolved, and reputedly they never spoke again. This had started three years previously in 1995 when Sheringham had snubbed Cole as the latter came on to make his international debut.

Speculation that Sheringham would leave United increased just after the 1998–99 season got underway, when Dwight Yorke moved to Old Trafford from Aston Villa. Yorke immediately formed a prolific partnership with Cole as United went on to regain the league title on the final day of the season. Sheringham&#x27;s first-team chances were relatively limited but he still managed to make enough appearances to qualify for a championship medal at the end of the season – at the age of 33 he had won his first major trophy. A week later he came off the substitutes bench to score United&#x27;s opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of Newcastle United in the FA Cup final to secure the double. Four days after the FA Cup triumph, Sheringham scored a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, having come on as a substitute earlier in the game. With seconds of stoppage-time remaining, Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored from Sheringham&#x27;s headed flick-on, and United won a treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup with Sheringham – having not won a major honour in his 15-year career – now having won every top-level trophy in the English game.

Sheringham&#x27;s first-team chances remained limited during the 1999–2000 season, but he still played enough times to merit another Premier League title medal. In the 2000–01 season, United secured a third consecutive league title, with Sheringham top-scoring for United and playing some of the best football of his career. In April 2001, he was voted Footballer of the Year by both the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association and Football Writers&#x27; Association. His fine form ensured that he was still involved with the national side despite being in his 35th year, being named in the squad for the 2002 World Cup.

===Return to Tottenham Hotspur===
At the end of the 2000–01 season, Sheringham&#x27;s four-year contract at Old Trafford expired. He was facing stiffer competition than ever for the places up front, most of all from United&#x27;s new Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. He refused United&#x27;s offer of a 12-month contract and returned to Tottenham on a free transfer as one of new manager Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s first signings. In his first season back, Sheringham helped Tottenham to a ninth-place finish, the club&#x27;s highest in six years, and to reach the League Cup final where they lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers, with Sheringham being brought down in the penalty area in the last minute for what he believed to be a penalty. 2002–03 brought a similar mid table finish, although Tottenham had topped the Premier League three games into the season. Sheringham made 80 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham in this period, scoring 26 goals.

Sheringham and Clive Allen were inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 8 May 2008.

===Portsmouth===
On the expiry of his Tottenham contract at the end of the 2002–03 season, Tottenham decided not to offer Sheringham a new contract and he joined Portsmouth in their first season in the Premier League. Sheringham became the oldest Premier League player to score a hat-trick when he scored three against Bolton early in the season. Despite this, he was only contracted to the club for one season and, despite scoring in his final game (a 5–1 win victory over Middlesbrough with the club already secure in the top flight), at the end of the 2003–04 season, Portsmouth decided not to offer the 38-year-old striker another contract but he insisted that he wanted to continue his top flight career at another club. Sheringham made 38 appearances for Portsmouth, scoring ten goals.

===West Ham United===

Sheringham then dropped down a division to the Championship to sign for West Ham United, the club he supported as a boy. Sheringham was the division&#x27;s third-highest scorer in the 2004–05 season with 20 goals (21 in all competitions) – one of the highest goalscoring seasons of his career. He won the Championship Player of the Season award, and helped the &quot;Hammers&quot; reach the 2005 Football League Championship play-off final where they beat Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium to return to the Premier League after two seasons in the second tier. At the end of the 2004–05 season, Sheringham&#x27;s one-year contract expired and both he and West Ham agreed to a one-year extension prior to the start of the new season. With his second-half appearance against Charlton Athletic on 2 April 2006, Sheringham became one of just five players to have played top-flight football while in their 40s; joining the likes of Les Sealey, John Burridge, Gordon Strachan and later Ryan Giggs. On 19 August 2006, he became the oldest outfield player in the history of the division, at 40 years 139 days. Sheringham signed a contract to play for West Ham until the end of the 2006–07 season, and was a player at the club after his 41st birthday. On 13 May 2006, Sheringham became the third oldest player to appear in an FA Cup final, at 40 years and 41 days old. The game ended 3–3, with Liverpool winning the trophy in a penalty shootout. Sheringham was the only West Ham player to convert his kick as Liverpool won the shootout 3–1. On 26 December 2006, at the age of 40 years and 266 days, he beat his own record for oldest Premier League scorer, with the goal in a 2–1 defeat to Portsmouth. On 30 December 2006, he broke the record for oldest Premier League outfield player once more, playing in the 1–0 defeat against Manchester City, aged 40 years and 270 days. Sheringham also appeared in 11 FA Cup, League Cup, and UEFA Cup games for West Ham, scoring two goals.

===Colchester United===
After being released by West Ham, Sheringham signed for Colchester United in July 2007 and was given the number 8 shirt. He started Colchester&#x27;s first game of the season, away at Sheffield United, and scored the first goal in a 2–2 home draw against Barnsley a week later. 7 days later he scored again, in a 3–0 win at Preston North End. Having just served a three match suspension after being sent off against Coventry, Sheringham was once again amongst the scorers in Colchester&#x27;s 2–1 win at Hillsborough over Sheffield Wednesday. He scored his fourth and final Colchester goal in a 3–1 FA Cup defeat to Peterborough United on 5 January 2008. Sheringham made only 3 league appearances in 2008, the last of which came against Stoke City on 26 April 2008, the last game at Layer Road.

Whilst at Colchester, Sheringham was the oldest player in all four divisions of the Football League, and is now part of the elite list of players who have achieved more than 700 league appearances in their career. He retired at the end of the 2007–08 season, his career ending on a low note as Colchester were relegated from the Championship – the club&#x27;s first relegation for 18 years.

==International career==
Something of a late developer on the international scene, Sheringham did not win his first England cap until the age of 27 in 1993. Under the reign of manager Terry Venables (1994–96) Sheringham came to be the preferred strike partner for Alan Shearer. During this time, England had a wealth of strikers with the likes of Andy Cole, Ian Wright, a young Robbie Fowler and Les Ferdinand all battling to partner Shearer in the England team.

The two formed a famous partnership at international level, as they complemented each other&#x27;s strengths: Shearer the out-and-out goalscorer, big, strong and powerful, Sheringham just &#x27;dropping off&#x27; his strike partner, finding spaces, creating play and providing key passes, forming the link between Shearer and the England midfield. The pairing came to be known as &#x27;The SAS&#x27; (&#x27;Shearer and Sheringham&#x27;) and their most successful time together came in Euro 96, held in England. Their most famous contribution was in the 4–1 victory over the Netherlands, a game in the opening group stages in which they both scored twice against one of the strongest teams in the tournament. Though England were eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, many believed that that squad of players such as Sheringham and his contemporaries including Paul Gascoigne, Steve McManaman, Tony Adams and Paul Ince, had done the nation proud. At this time, the England squad were also criticised heavily in the media for their part in several off the field incidents during the lead up to the tournament, where Sheringham, McManaman and Gascoigne were photographed drinking heavily and playing &quot;dentist chair&quot; drinking games as well as destroying the first class cabin of a Cathay Pacific flight which went down poorly with the public.

Sheringham continued to be a first choice selection under new England manager Glenn Hoddle (1996–99) until the emergence of new teenage superstar Michael Owen during the course of 1998 saw him overshadowed. Although Sheringham began the 1998 FIFA World Cup as a starting player with Owen on the bench, after Owen replaced him and almost turned around a defeat against Romania in England&#x27;s second game of the tournament, it seemed likely that Sheringham&#x27;s front line international career had come to an end.

He was not selected at all for UEFA Euro 2000 by then manager Kevin Keegan, but the retirement of Shearer (despite being four years younger than Sheringham) from international football after that tournament and the arrival of new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson in 2001 saw a return to international favour for him. He was often deployed as a tactical substitute late in games by Eriksson, valued for his ability to hold the ball up and create intelligent play. In 2001, Sheringham scored an important goal for England against Greece in a World Cup qualifying match within 15 seconds of coming on as a substitute, although this event is overshadowed by the 93rd minute equalising free-kick by David Beckham.

He was selected as part of Eriksson&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup squad after impressing throughout the 2001–02 season with his club, and played in the famous 1–0 win against Argentina, almost scoring a goal with a volley that was well saved by the Argentine goalkeeper, and made his final England appearance as a substitute in the 2–1 quarter-final defeat to Brazil in Japan. His twelve appearances for Eriksson were all as a substitute.

At the age of 36, that defeat signalled the final end of Sheringham&#x27;s international career, during which he had earned fifty-one caps and scored eleven times for England.

==Style of play==
A versatile forward, Sheringham was capable of playing as a striker and also as a supporting forward, courtesy of his ability both to score and create goals. Due to his vision, his ability to read the game, and his short passing ability, Sheringham was capable of playing off another striker, in a deeper, creative role, where he served as an assist provider, in particular in later years, as he lost pace and stamina. He also possessed good technical ability and upper body strength, which allowed him to retain possession in the box and hold up the ball when playing with his back to goal, and subsequently lay it off to his teammates. As a centre-forward in his prime, he was also very effective and extremely prolific, due to his accurate finishing, opportunism in the area, intelligence, and his ability in the air, which enabled him to be regarded as one of the top Premier League forwards of his generation.

==Poker career==
Upon his retirement from professional football in 2008, Sheringham has been a noticeable figure on the world poker scene, playing in various competitions worldwide. He made the final table in the €5,000 No Limit Hold&#x27;em Main Event in the EPT Vilamoura, finishing 5th out of a field of 384 players, winning €93,121.

==Coaching career==
In May 2014, Sheringham was appointed as an attacking coach with West Ham United. He was credited with a change in West Ham&#x27;s style of play which led to a run of good form at the start of the 2014–15 season, earning striker Diafra Sakho the Premier League Player of the Month award for October 2014.

On 21 May 2015, Sheringham was appointed to his first managerial role, taking charge of League Two side Stevenage, replacing Graham Westley. With the club struggling with injuries, he registered himself as a player, aged 49, for a Herts Senior Cup match against Welwyn Garden City in November of that year, but did not play. He was sacked on 1 February 2016, with the club 19th in the league having collected only three points from their previous eight matches.

On 14 July 2017, Sheringham was named as the new head coach of Indian Super League club ATK. On 24 January 2018, Sheringham was sacked by ATK after winning only three of his ten games in charge of the Kolkata-based outfit.

==Personal life==
Sheringham&#x27;s son Charlie, born in 1988, also became a professional footballer. The two made the FA Cup third round draw together in December 2013. Sheringham has two more children with Kristina Andriotis, whom he married in 2016. Earlier in his life, he dated models Danielle Lloyd and Katie Price.

Since 2005, Sheringham has resided in Sewardstonebury, Essex, just north of the border between Essex and Waltham Forest. He named his house Nou Camp in reference to the stadium that hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, stating &quot;I had a house built in 2005 and at the end, when it was finished, it was the perfect house, so I called it Camp Nou after that fantastic night.&quot;

In 2007, Sheringham was awarded an MBE at that year&#x27;s Birthday Honours for services to football.

In 2020, Sheringham competed on the first British series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, masked as &quot;Tree&quot;.

<text>The Fleischer &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons are a series of seventeen animated superhero short films released in Technicolor by Paramount Pictures and based upon the comic book character Superman, making them his first animated appearance.

They were originally produced by Fleischer Studios, which completed the initial short and eight further cartoons in 1941 and 1942. Production was resumed in May 1942 by Famous Studios, the successor company to Fleischer, which produced eight more cartoons in 1942–1943. &quot;Superman&quot; was the final animated series initiated by Fleischer Studios before Famous Studios officially took over production.

Although all entries are in the public domain in the United States, ancillary rights, such as merchandising contract rights, as well as the original 35 mm master elements, are owned today by Warner Bros., which has also owned Superman&#x27;s publisher, DC Comics, since 1969. In 2023, Warner Bros. released a Blu-ray set containing the 17 cartoons, taken from high-definition restorations of the original 35mm source elements.

== History ==
=== Development and initial entries ===
Only the first nine cartoons were produced by Fleischer Studios; nonetheless, all seventeen shorts are collectively known as &quot;the Fleischer &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons&quot;. In 1942, Fleischer Studios was dissolved and reorganized as Famous Studios, which produced the final eight shorts. These cartoons are seen as some of the finest quality (and certainly, the most lavishly budgeted) animated cartoons produced during The Golden Age of American animation. In 1994, the first entry in the series was voted #33 on a list of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.

By mid-1941, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer were running their own animation studio in Miami, Florida, and had recently finished their first animated feature film, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. The Fleischers were also well into production on their second, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;. Not wanting to risk becoming overworked (which could compromise the quality of each project), the Fleischers were strongly (but quietly) opposed to the idea of committing themselves to another major project when they were approached by their studio&#x27;s distributor and majority owner since May 1941, Paramount Pictures. Paramount was interested in financially exploiting the phenomenal popularity of the then-new &quot;Superman&quot; comic books, by producing a series of theatrical cartoons based upon the character. The Fleischers, looking for a way to reject the project without &quot;appearing&quot; uncooperative, agreed to do the series—but only at an (intentionally inflated) per-episode-budget number so exorbitantly high that Paramount would have to reject &quot;them&quot;, instead. They told Paramount that producing such a conceptually and technically complex series of cartoons would cost about $100,000 per short (or $ per short as of ); this was about four times the typical budget of a six-minute short of the Fleischers&#x27; popular &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; cartoons of that period. To the Fleischers&#x27; shock, instead of withdrawing its request, Paramount entered into negotiations with them, and got the per-episode budget lowered to $50,000. (or $ per short as of ) Now the Fleischers were committed to a project they never wanted to do—with more financial and marketing support than they had ever received for the projects they had done thus far.

The first cartoon in the series, simply titled &quot;Superman&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Mad Scientist&quot;), was released on September 26, 1941, and was nominated for the 1941 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons. It lost to &quot;Lend a Paw&quot;, a Pluto cartoon from Walt Disney Productions and RKO Radio Pictures.

The voice of Superman for the series was initially provided by Bud Collyer, who also performed the lead character&#x27;s voice during &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; radio series. Joan Alexander was the voice of Lois Lane, a role she also portrayed on radio alongside Collyer. Music for the series was composed by Sammy Timberg, the Fleischers&#x27; long-time musical collaborator.

Rotoscoping, the process of tracing animation drawings from live-action footage, was used minimally to lend realism to the character&#x27;s bodily movements. Many of Superman&#x27;s actions, however, could not be rotoscoped (such as flying, lifting very large objects, etc.). In these cases, the Fleischers&#x27; lead animators—many of whom lacked training in figure drawing—animated &quot;roughly&quot; and depended upon their assistants (usually inexperienced animators but established draftsmen) to keep Superman &quot;on model&quot; during his action sequences.

The Fleischer cartoons were also responsible for giving Superman perhaps his most singular superpower: flight. When the Fleischers started work on the series, the Superman of the comic books could only &quot;leap&quot; from place to place (hence the classic phrase, &quot;able to leap tall buildings in a single bound&quot;). After seeing the leaping fully animated, however, the Fleischers deemed it &quot;silly looking&quot;, and asked permission from Action Comics (later DC Comics) to have him fly instead; the publisher agreed and Superman was formally given the power of flight thereafter. Previously, he was only shown flying on the cover of &quot;Triumph&quot; #772, in &quot;The Adventure of Superman&quot; radio show and in the comics due to an artist and editorial error in &quot;Superman&quot; #10.

=== Transition from Fleischer to Famous ===
By the end of 1941, the brothers were no longer able to cooperate with each other, and the studio&#x27;s co-owner Dave Fleischer had left Florida for California, where he would eventually become the new head of Columbia Pictures&#x27; Screen Gems studio. After the Fleischers were removed from the company, Paramount renamed the organization Famous Studios, placing Seymour Kneitel (Max Fleischer&#x27;s son-in-law), Isadore Sparber, Sam Buchwald, and Dan Gordon in charge of production. The sleek look of the series continued, but there was a noticeable change in the storylines of the later shorts of the series after Famous replaced Fleischer as producer. The first nine cartoons had more of a science fiction aspect to them, as they involved the Man of Steel fighting robots, giant monsters, meteors from outer space, and other perils.
The later eight cartoons in the series, which were all Famous Studios productions, dealt more with World War II propaganda stories, such as in &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;, which finds Superman going to Japan to commit acts of sabotage in order to reduce the morale of the enemy; meanwhile, an angered Adolf Hitler had a cameo role at the end of &quot;Jungle Drums&quot; after Superman foiled another Nazi plot.

The first seven cartoons originated the classic opening line which was later adopted by the &quot;Superman&quot; radio series and in the live-action television series a decade later: &quot;Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!&quot; (the radio series also eventually used the cartoon series&#x27; theme music). For the final two Fleischer-produced cartoons and the first of the eight Famous Studios-produced cartoons, the opening was changed to &quot;Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to soar higher than any plane!&quot;. For the remaining Famous Studios-produced cartoons, the opening line was changed again to &quot;Faster than a streak of lightning! More powerful than the pounding surf! Mightier than a roaring hurricane!&quot; For international prints of &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons starting with &quot;Showdown&quot; the opening line is &quot;Faster than a streak of lightning! More powerful than the pounding surf! Mightier than a roaring hurricane!&quot; This series also featured a slight variation of the now-classic exclamation (also from the radio series): &quot;Up in the sky, look! It&#x27;s a bird! It&#x27;s a plane! It&#x27;s Superman!&quot;.

=== Later history ===
Famous Studios ended the series after a total of seventeen shorts had been produced, replacing it with the &quot;Little Lulu&quot; series, which was based on Marge&#x27;s comic strip of the same name. The high cost of the series kept it from continuing in the face of budgetary restrictions that were imposed after removing the Fleischers from the studio. The first cartoon had a budget of $50,000 (equivalent to $ in ), and the other sixteen each had a budget of $30,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for each of the eight other Fleischer cartoons and $485,414.68 for each of the eight Famous Studios cartoons, bringing the total cost of the series to $530,000 (equivalent to $ in ). In addition, Paramount cited waning interest in the &quot;Superman&quot; shorts among theater exhibitors as another justification for the series&#x27; cancellation.

The rights to all seventeen cartoons eventually reverted to National Comics, who licensed TV syndication rights to Flamingo Films (distributors of the TV series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;). All eventually fell into the public domain, due to National&#x27;s failure to renew their copyrights; thus, they have been widely distributed on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. Nonetheless, Warner Bros. (via DC Comics) now owns the original film elements to the cartoons.

=== Related works ===
A 1944 Famous Studios &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; cartoon entitled &quot;She-Sick Sailors&quot; parodied the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons a year after production of the cartoons had ceased. In this cartoon, Popeye&#x27;s enemy Bluto, who was voiced by the announcer for the Superman radio series, Jackson Beck, dresses up as Superman to fool Olive Oyl, and he challenges Popeye to feats of super-strength that &quot;only Superman&quot; can do. The musical score for &quot;She-Sick Sailors&quot; includes echoes of Sammy Timberg&#x27;s Fleischer/Famous &quot;Superman&quot; score.

The previous year, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; did a parody starring Bugs Bunny called &quot;Super-Rabbit&quot;.

In a rare move for a competing studio, Leon Schlesinger Productions, producers of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; (which were distributed by Warner Bros.), featured Timberg&#x27;s Superman theme in &quot;Snafuperman&quot;, a 1944 &quot;Private Snafu&quot; cartoon Schlesinger produced for the U.S. Army.

== Influence and legacy ==
In 1985, DC Comics named Fleischer Studios as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for its work on the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons. The series strongly influenced the creation of the acclaimed animated television series &quot;&quot;, as well as the similar-looking &quot;&quot;. Comic book artist Alex Ross has also listed the shorts among the inspiration for his take on Superman&#x27;s look.

This animated version of Superman was planned to be made as a cameo in the original final scene from the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

The robot robbery scene from &quot;The Mechanical Monsters&quot; has been echoed by several later works. In 1980, Japanese animated film writer and director Hayao Miyazaki created an identical robbery with a similarly functioning robot in the last episode of the TV series &quot;Lupin the Third Part II&quot;, a robot design he used again in his feature film &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;.

The elements of the scene were borrowed again in 1994 for &quot;The Tick vs. Brainchild&quot; (Season 1, Episode 9 of &quot;The Tick&quot;), with the robbery committed by Skippy, a cyborg dog.

The 2004 feature-length film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; (which Paramount released in several territories, Warner Bros. also distributed in a few countries) kept the setting in the 1940s, but scaled up the scene from a single robot robbing a jewelry exhibition to an army of gigantic robots stealing city infrastructure. The movie gave a nod to its source following the robbery with the newspaper headline, &quot;Mechanical Monsters Unearth Generators&quot;.

&quot;The Mechanical Monsters&quot; itself was featured as part of &quot;Fantastic Animation Festival&quot;.

A 1988 music video for the song &quot;Spy in the House of Love&quot; by Chrysalis Records recording artists Was (Not Was) borrowed footage extensively from Famous&#x27; &quot;Secret Agent&quot; short.

=== Arrowverse ===
In the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; tie-in comic, the world of those cartoons takes place on Earth-F before being destroyed by the Anti-Monitor.

== Availability ==
The Paramount &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons are widely available on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, and online.

The first &quot;official&quot; home video releases of the series were by Warner Home Video in 1987 and 1988, in a series of VHS and LaserDisc packages called &quot;TV&#x27;s Best Adventures of Superman&quot;. Four volumes were released, where each volume contained 2 selected episodes of the classic 1950s TV series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; (one black-and-white episode and one color episode), plus a selected Max Fleischer &quot;Superman&quot; short (marking the first &quot;official&quot; release of such as Warner holds the original film elements).

Among the best reviewed of these various releases was a 1991 VHS set produced by Bosko Video, the somewhat incorrectly titled &quot;The Complete Superman Collection: Golden Anniversary Edition – The Paramount Cartoon Classics of Max &amp; Dave Fleischer&quot; released as two VHS volumes which featured high-quality transfers from 35 mm prints. The Bosko Video set was later issued on DVD by Image Entertainment as &quot;The Complete Superman Collection: Diamond Anniversary Edition&quot; in 2000. The Bosko Video release was not associated with DC Comics or their parent company Warner Bros.

Another DVD was &quot;Superman: The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection&quot; from VCI Entertainment released on May 30, 2006, a month prior to the release of the film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. DVD features included: all 17 animated shorts digitally restored in Dolby Digital 2.0 audio; a bonus cartoon: &quot;Snafuperman&quot; (a 1944 Warner Bros. wartime parody of the Fleischer cartoons, featuring Private Snafu and produced for the U.S. Army); &quot;Behind the Cape&quot; synopses and fun facts with each cartoon; a DVD fold-out booklet with notes on the series; bios of the voice actors, producer Max Fleischer, and Superman; a bonus trailer for the 1948 &quot;Superman&quot; serial with Kirk Alyn; and a recorded audio phone interview with Joan Alexander (the voice of Lois Lane). This release, like the Bosko Video release, was not associated with DC Comics or their parent company Warner Bros.

A more &quot;official&quot; release from restored and remastered, superior original vault elements was released on DVD on November 28, 2006, as part of Warner Home Video&#x27;s re-releases of the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons. The first nine cartoons were released as part of the four-disc special edition &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; set, and the eight remaining cartoons were included on the two-disc special edition &quot;Superman II&quot; set. The entire collected Fleischer / Famous cartoons were included in the box sets &quot;The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection&quot; and &quot;Superman Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, where both sets also included a 13-minute short documentary on the history of these cartoons, entitled &quot;First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series&quot;. This documentary (which was included on the &quot;Superman II&quot; two-disc special edition DVD) features interviews with surviving members, relatives and biographers of the animation and production team, also contemporary animators such as Bruce Timm (&quot;&quot;), Paul Dini and Dan Riba (&quot;&quot;), who detail the influence these cartoons have had on their own works. Upon this release though, there was controversy by some consumers over why Warner Bros. chose to release these animated shorts amongst the &quot;Superman&quot; films DVD releases instead of packaging them as their own complete individual DVD release.

In 2004, a two-disc set was released by Platinum disc corporation with digitally enhanced audio 5.1.

In December 2004, Toonami Digital Arsenal made the shorts available for free download in mp4 format on its website. They posted one episode per day with the final episode, &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, going live on New Year&#x27;s Day 2005.

Another came on July 1, 2008, when Warner Bros. released the shorts on iTunes via their DC Comics sections. Fourteen of the shorts are available for $1.99 for every two, while the other three are all in one video for the same price.

On April 7, 2009, another release was made, this time a collection of all the cartoons released by Warner Home Video as the first authorized collection from the original masters, titled &quot;Max Fleischer&#x27;s Superman: 1941–1942&quot; with a suggested price at $26.99; the set included one new special feature in the form of &quot;&quot;The Man, The Myth, Superman&quot; featurette, along with an old special feature seen in the &quot;Superman II&quot; 2006 DVD release entitled &quot;First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series&quot;&quot;.

The 8-disc Blu-ray boxset &quot;The Superman Motion Picture Anthology&quot;, released in June 2011, includes all the Max Fleischer cartoons in SD as bonuses on the discs for the two versions of &quot;Superman II&quot;. The nine Fleischer Studios cartoons plus the 13-minutes feature &quot;First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series&quot; are on the &quot;Superman II – Original 1980/81 Theatrical Release&quot; disc and the eight Famous Studios cartoons are on the &quot;Superman II – The 2006 Richard Donner Cut&quot; disc.

A Blu-ray set containing all the cartoons, called &quot;Max Fleischer&#x27;s Superman: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was released on October 30, 2012, by the Gaiam studio. According to Blu-Ray.com and Amazon reviews, it was upscaled from standard definition to HD, and the set&#x27;s video quality and audio quality were criticized.

The shorts were available for the first time in true HD on WarnerMedia&#x27;s DC Universe streaming service. After the service went down in early 2021, they were no longer available. As of 2023, they have yet to reappear on Warner Bros.&#x27;s flagship streaming service Max.

An &quot;official&quot; Blu-ray set from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment was released on May 16, 2023. All of the cartoons are presented in 1080p resolution based on a 4K scan of the original 35 mm successive exposure negative.

<text>The Government Legal Department (previously called the Treasury Solicitor&#x27;s Department) is the largest in-house legal organisation in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Government Legal Profession.

The department is headed by the Treasury Solicitor (formally, &#x27;The Solicitor for the affairs of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury&#x27;). This office goes back several centuries. The office was enshrined in law by the Treasury Solicitor Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 18), which established the Treasury Solicitor as a corporation sole (an office with perpetual succession). Employees of the department exercise legal powers which are vested in the corporation sole.

The department is a non-ministerial government department and executive agency. The Treasury Solicitor reports to the Attorney General for England and Wales. The department employs more than 1,900 solicitors and barristers to provide advice and legal representation on a huge range of issues to many government departments.

==History==
The department was historically known as the Treasury Solicitor&#x27;s Department, but changed name to the Government Legal Department on 1 April 2015. The new name reflects a &quot;significant period of change&quot;, which saw the department double in size to 2,000 staff.

The head of the department combines the ancient office of King&#x27;s Proctor with that of Treasury Solicitor. She has the formal title of His Majesty&#x27;s Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor. The office is currently held by Susanna McGibbon who succeeded Sir Jonathan Jones after his resignation on 8 September 2020. She is also the Chief Executive of the department as an executive agency.

==Functions==
Government Legal Department lawyers work in both advisory and litigation roles. In litigation, lawyers bring and defend legal proceedings involving central government and related bodies. In advisory teams, lawyers provide advice to ministers and civil servants on both the current law and on proposed Government policies and future legislation.

The department is the authorised address for service of proceedings on most government departments, by virtue of the list published under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.

In England (with the exception of Lancashire, Manchester and Cornwall, where the function is delegated to Farrer &amp; Co), the Treasury Solicitor is the Crown&#x27;s nominee for the collection and disposition of ownerless property (&quot;bona vacantia&quot;). This typically comprises the assets of dissolved companies and the estates of persons who die intestate and with no known kin.

== List of HM Procurators-General and Treasury Solicitors ==
=== King&#x27;s Proctor/Procurators General ===
The office of King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Proctor is ancient; it also came to be known as HM Procurator General. The following were King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Proctor after 1660:

* 1660–1669: Alexander Cheeke
*1669–1700: Samuel Franklyn
*1700–1710: Thomas Smith
*1710–1714: George Smith
*1714–1727: Henry Farrant
*1727–1750: Edward Greenly
*1750–1766: Thomas Tindal
*1766–1783: Philip Champion de Crespigny
*1783–1804: James Heseltine
*1804–1815: Charles Bishop
*1815–1844: Iltid Nicholl
*1845–1876: Francis Hart Dyke

=== Treasury Solicitor ===
Historically, there were two solicitors in the Treasury. The first (The Solicitor for Negotiating and Looking after the Affairs of the Treasury), which existed alone until 1696, had become a sinecure by 1744, and perhaps as early as 1716; from the late 18th century the office included a salary of £200 a year. It was abolished in 1800. A second Treasury Solicitor, the precursor of the modern office, was established in 1696 and was assigned all the legal business undertaken in Westminster Hall; as the first Solicitor became a sinecure, the second Solicitor became the only one responsible for legal business. By 1786, its office-holder was carrying out legal work for other secretaries of state and the Attorney-General, and in the early nineteenth century was employed by other government departments as well. From 1794, the Solicitor was also barred from running their own private practice. The salary began at £500, increased to £1,000 in 1755 and then to £2,000 in 1794; until the 1830s, the Solicitor also charged fees for work done in departments outside the Treasury, but these were then abolished and he received an allowance of £850 in addition to his salary. The whole salary was fixed at £2,000 in 1851, and then increased to £2,500 in 1872. The following were Treasury Solicitors after 1660.

<text>In computing, Quark is an operating system kernel used in MorphOS. It is a microkernel designed to run fully virtualized computers, called &quot;boxes&quot; (see sandbox). , only one &quot;box&quot; is available, the &quot;ABox&quot;, that lets users run extant AmigaOS software compiled for Motorola 68000 series (MC680x0 or 68k) and PowerPC central processing units (CPUs).

==Design goals==

The Quark microkernel is not a member of the L4 microkernel family, but borrows concepts from it, including: the &quot;clan&quot; (group of tasks), ID concept, and recursive address mapping. Quark also has an asynchronous/synchronous message interface similar to Amiga&#x27;s Exec kernel but adapted to an environment with memory protection.

Other Quark features include:
* High super/usermode switch speed
* Low interrupt latency
* Interrupt threads (IntThreads) and Int P-code abstraction
* Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
* Models task/thread and clan/chief
* Resource tracking
* Virtual memory (optional)
* Distributed computing
* No access to kernel structures
* Clean design with an elegant application programming interface (API)
* Micro/pico kernel mix

For this new kernel, a hardware abstraction layer is used which provides the needed hardware resource information like scanning all Amiga Zorro II bus boards, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) boards, and local hardware resources.

==Functions==

* SYS_AddLinkMessage
* SYS_AttemptSemaphore
* SYS_AttemptSemaphoreShared
* SYS_CopyCPUHalConfig
* SYS_CreateMemList
* SYS_CreateTask
* SYS_DeletePort
* SYS_DeleteSemaphore

==Trance JIT==
&quot;Trance JIT&quot; is a MorphOS just-in-time (JIT) compiler, or code translator, for running 68k applications within the MorphOS environment. It has been part of the MorphOS operating system since MorphOS 1.4.

MorphOS has a fully integrated 68k emulator to run many Amiga applications, which were almost exclusively compiled for the 68k processor, though MorphOS runs on PowerPC. Trance supplements this function by adding JIT compiling, increasing the speed of the emulation. It does not interfere with the full integration of 68k and PowerPC tasks MorphOS provides.

Trance exists in the form of an executable, run during boot, and a shared library. Although it is not technically part of the kernel, and MorphOS can be run without it, Trance is considered a fundamental part of MorphOS and one of its most powerful features.

Compatibility of Trance is considered to be very high and there are few to no 68k instruction sequences or applications which cause it any problems. It is also considered to be very fast, with users noticing few differences between 68k programs and native PowerPC code.

Trance was developed by Ralph Schmidt and Teemu Suikki, with minor support from other MorphOS team members, Mark Olsen, Sigbjørn Skjæret, and Harry Sintonen.

==ABox==
Under the Quark kernel, a PowerPC native reimplementation of the OS known from the Commodore International A1000, A500(+), A600, A2000, A1200, A3000(T), and A4000(T) systems runs as a mix of a virtual emulation and a driver. This OS driver is called an ABox.

The 68k emulation is written in C and uses GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) assembly language macros where needed to speed up some complex instructions.

A JIT engine named Trance is also available for MorphOS, to speed up old 68k programs beyond the current state of the traditional emulation.

The PPC native Exec supports the PowerPC register model which means there is no difference for this Exec if it runs 68k or PowerPC code. PowerPC code does not block multitasking inside the OS box like in emulations where the 68k code is just emulated in some host system&#x27;s task (then every access outside this environment would stop the multitasking in the emulated environment).

For applications running under this new PowerPC ABox kernel 68k code runs as subroutines inside PowerPC tasks. For 68k or PowerPC applications it&#x27;s fully transparent if some library, hook, interrupt is still 68k or already using PowerPC code.

<doc id="526164" wikidata="Q331093" url="?curid=526164" title="Arabian plate">
<text>The Arabian plate is a minor tectonic plate in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres.

It is one of the three continental plates (along with the African and Indian plates) that have been moving northward in geological history and colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision is resulting in a mingling of plate pieces and mountain ranges extending in the west from the Pyrenees, crossing Southern Europe to Iranian plateau, forming the Alborz and the Zagros Mountains, to the Himalayas and ranges of Southeast Asia.

==Lexicology==

The &quot;Arabian plate&quot; is a designation of the region, and it is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Arab plate&quot;.

==Borders==
The Arabian plate consists mostly of the Arabian Peninsula; it extends westward to the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea and northward to the Levant. The plate borders are:

*East, with the Indo-Australian plate, at the Owen fracture zone
*South, with the African plate to the west and the Somali plate and the Indo-Australian plate to the east
*West, a left lateral fault boundary with the African plate called the Dead Sea Transform (DST), and a divergent boundary with the African plate called the Red Sea Rift which runs the length of the Red Sea;
*North, convergent boundary with the Anatolian plate and Eurasian plate, including the East Anatolian Fault, Zagros fold and thrust belt, and Makran Trench.

==History==
The Arabian plate was part of the African plate during most of the Phanerozoic Eon (Paleozoic–Cenozoic), until the Oligocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era. The Red Sea rifting began in the Eocene, and the separation of Africa and Arabia occurred approximately in the Oligocene, and since then the Arabian plate has been moving toward the Eurasian plate. The opening of the Red Sea rift led to volcanic activity. There are volcanic fields called the Older Harrats, such as Harrat Khaybar and Harrat Rahat, cover parts of the western Arabian plate. Some activity still continues especially around Medina, and there are regular eruptions within the Red Sea. 

The collision between the Arabian plate and Eurasia is pushing up the Zagros Mountains of Iran. Because the Arabian plate and Eurasian plate collide, some cities such as those in southeastern Turkey (which is on the Arabian plate) may undergo earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes.

==Countries and regions==
Countries within the plate include Bahrain, Djibouti, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Regions include the Anti-Lebanon Mountains (Lebanon), parts of Awdal (Somalia/Somaliland), the Khuzestan province (Iran), the Southeastern Anatolia region (Turkey), and the Southern Denkalya subregion (Eritrea).

<doc id="526167" wikidata="Q192175" url="?curid=526167" title="Dwight Yorke">
<text>Dwight Eversley Yorke CM (born 3 November 1971) is a Trinidadian and Tobagonian professional football coach and former player who is the head coach of Trinidad and Tobago. Throughout his club career, he played for Aston Villa, Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham City, Sydney FC and Sunderland, mainly as a forward, between 1998 and 2009. Yorke formed a prolific strike partnership with Andy Cole at Manchester United, where he won numerous honours including several Premier League titles and the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999. Yorke scored 123 goals in the Premier League, a record for a non-European which was not broken until Sergio Agüero in 2017.

At international level, Yorke represented Trinidad and Tobago on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and later qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in its history, representing his country in the 2006 tournament. After retiring from playing in 2009, Yorke became assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team, a position he held until the completion of the qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
Yorke was first discovered by Graham Taylor, at the time the Aston Villa manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke, aged 17, appeared in a team that played a friendly against Aston Villa. Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and played for the Villa Reserve and Youth sides for the majority of the 1989–90 season, making his First Division debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1–0. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the 1995–96 season, he then switched to centre forward and established himself as one of the Premier League&#x27;s top strikers.

Yorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the League Cup Final in 1996. Villa won 3–0 against Leeds United with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4–3 defeat. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times.

The circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa&#x27;s manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker Andy Cole. Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at Everton on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made little effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for £12.6 million on 20 August 1998.

===Manchester United===
In his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League, and forming a legendary partnership with Andy Cole. Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Inter Milan, and Juventus in the Champions League, and he won the Premier League Player of the Season. Yorke was also a regular member of United&#x27;s 1999–2000 title winning team, contributing 23 goals in all competitions.

Despite a less successful third season, Yorke scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3-0 victory over Derby County on 24 November 2000 and also netted a hat-trick in the top of the table clash with Arsenal. In January 2002 a move to Middlesbrough fell through. He played his last game for United that month, and was not issued a squad number for the 2002–03 season. Altogether he scored 65 goals for Manchester United in 152 appearances.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In July 2002, Yorke moved to Blackburn Rovers for an initial £2 million, potentially rising to £2.6 million; United had wanted a fee of £6 million. He was signed to cover the long absence of Matt Jansen from a traffic accident, and was reunited with his former United strike partner Andy Cole.

Yorke scored 13 goals in all competitions in his first season at Ewood Park, including the winner on 26 October 2002 as Rovers won 2–1 at reigning champions Arsenal. The following 4 January on his return to Villa Park, he scored twice in a 4–1 win in the FA Cup third round. On 11 May, in the last game of the season, he opened a 4–0 win at Tottenham Hotspur as Blackburn beat Everton to sixth place and UEFA Cup qualification.

===Birmingham City===
On 31 August 2004, transfer deadline day, Yorke moved to Birmingham City on a one-year deal with the option of a second. Instead of a loan to Celtic, he chose to join Birmingham for a &quot;substantial but undisclosed fee&quot;. It was later reported as £250,000.

Yorke scored on his home debut for Birmingham in a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic, with the equaliser seven minutes after replacing Clinton Morrison. He scored again against Graeme Souness&#x27;s Newcastle on 3 October. However, Yorke fell out of favour at St Andrew&#x27;s and was released by mutual consent in April 2005.

===Sydney FC===
Yorke immediately signed for Sydney FC, with a salary of $1 million a season. He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the Melbourne Victory. Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the treble with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from penalty kicks. Sydney FC coach Pierre Littbarski moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.

He played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals Central Coast Mariners. He set up the only goal, scored by Steve Corica, in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at the Sydney Football Stadium, and was awarded the Joe Marston Medal as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the marquee player for Sydney FC – meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the Football Federation Australia to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League&#x27;s second season.

Due to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.

Yorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against Everton in 2010. The game was considered his &#x27;farewell game&#x27; as he never had the chance to say a proper farewell to the fans at Sydney FC. Everton won the match 1–0, and Yorke was substituted midway through the second half.

===Sunderland===
On 31 August 2006, Yorke&#x27;s transfer to Sunderland was announced. The transfer for a fee of £200,000 (A$ $500,000) re-united Yorke with ex-teammate Roy Keane, manager of Sunderland. Yorke made his debut in the home match against Leicester City and received a rapturous standing ovation from home fans when he came on as a substitute in the first half. Yorke was used as a defensive midfielder rather than his usual striker role. He scored his first goal for Sunderland in the 2–1 loss against Stoke.

On 2 January 2008, during Sunderland&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Blackburn, Yorke was given a red card by referee Rob Styles. Yorke stated several times he would like to return to the A-League, preferably Sydney FC. However, following Sydney FC&#x27;s signings at the time it seemed unlikely that Sydney would have been able to fit him under the salary cap. It was reported that Yorke play for rivals Central Coast Mariners, the team bankrolled by the man who brought him to Sydney, Peter Turnbull.

On 11 March 2008, it was announced that the Mariners were in &quot;advanced negotiations&quot; with Yorke to become the marquee for two years. However, on 1 July he signed a new one-year contract to stay with Sunderland for the 2008–09 season. He was named man of the match for his performance against Arsenal on 4 October 2008, with Sunderland drawing 1–1 at home. Following Keane&#x27;s departure in December 2008, Yorke and Neil Bailey were named as assistants to Ricky Sbragia. Yorke was released at the end of the 2008–09 season.

===Post-retirement===
Yorke has completed his Level B coaching badge, and in 2010 was quoted as being interested in pursuing a career in coaching, ideally with Aston Villa. On 17 April 2011 he completed the London Marathon in a time of 3 hours and 32 minutes. On 14 August 2011, Yorke signed a two-year deal to work for Sky Sports as a pundit.

== International career ==
Yorke was capped 72 times for the Trinidad and Tobago national team, scoring 19 goals. Along with his friend Russell Latapy, Yorke was a member of the 1989 &#x27;Strike Squad&#x27;, the national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He retired from international football in 2001 after a disagreement with coach René Simões, who cut Yorke and Russell Latapy from the squad prior to a decisive game of the 2002 World Cup qualification, as both missed practice following a night partying. However he returned to the team for the 2006 World Cup qualification campaign, in which the team qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time in their history after a 2–1 aggregate qualifying victory over Bahrain.

Yorke was captain for all of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s games at the 2006 World Cup and was man of the match in the 0–0 draw against Sweden, pipping his close friend Shaka Hislop to the honour despite the then West Ham goalkeeper making several world-class saves. He was one of six players in the Trinidad squad (the others being Brent Sancho, Dennis Lawrence, Chris Birchall, Carlos Edwards and Stern John) to have played every minute of the campaign. Yorke was rated the best defensive midfielder in the opening stages of the World Cup.

Yorke announced his retirement from international football in March 2007, choosing to focus on his club career at Sunderland. He captained the side in Germany, and up until his retirement. However, he made a guest return appearance for a friendly against England in June 2008 after being invited by FIFA vice-president Jack Warner. On 10 July 2008, the TTFF announced Yorke&#x27;s return to the national team for the 2010 World Cup qualification campaign.

On 15 October 2008, he scored his first international goal after returning from retirement against the United States in a 2010 World Cup qualification match. The game ended 2–1 for Trinidad and Tobago. His goal was a crucial tie-breaker scored in the 79th minute, which put Trinidad and Tobago in a great situation to advance to the next qualifying stage, needing only a tie against Cuba in their final game. On 11 February 2009, Yorke scored a 26th-minute penalty for his country, but was sent off in the dying seconds of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s opening match of 2010 World Cup qualification against El Salvador (2–2) after exchanging heated remarks with Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez (the Trini star had voiced his disapproval of the disruptions caused by the home crowd) and was consequently banned for four games due to his use of abusive language. The suspension was later reduced to two matches.

After being released from Sunderland and being unable to find a club before the end of the current transfer window, Yorke retired from football altogether in September 2009, and took up the post of assistant manager with the Trinidad and Tobago national team.

==Management career==
===Early career===
On 21 April 2019, Yorke was interviewed for the vacant role at National League side Sutton United. However, Sutton appointed Matt Gray Instead.

On 12 November 2021, Aston Villa appointed Steven Gerrard as their new manager. Yorke said he was disappointed not to be hired instead.

On 21 April 2022 it was reported that Yorke was being considered for the vacant manager&#x27;s position at Perth Glory in the Australian A-League Men.

On 25 May 2022, Yorke managed the A-Leagues All Stars in their 3–2 loss against FC Barcelona.

===Macarthur FC===
On 1 July 2022, Yorke became the new manager of A-League Men side Macarthur FC, replacing Ante Milicic to become the club’s second manager. Three months later, he led the club towards its first trophy after winning the 2022 Australia Cup Final.

Yorke left the Bulls in January 2023, the day after a 1–0 loss to Adelaide United
===Trinidad and Tobago===
On 1 November 2024, Yorke became the new manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team, succeeding Angus Eve.

==Personal life==

Yorke grew up as a Tottenham Hotspur fan and his first jersey was a white Tottenham Hotspur shirt.

Yorke had a brief relationship with former model turned writer Katie Price that produced son Harvey, who was born in May 2002. He is autistic and partially blind, and has the genetic disorder Prader–Willi syndrome. In a 2009 interview, Yorke conceded being unfaithful to Price during their relationship, and subsequently playing no role in the upbringing of their son. He has not claimed paternity, despite a paternity test proving he is Harvey&#x27;s father. He has paid no financial amount regarding Harvey&#x27;s care and treatment nor visited or contacted his son.

The Dwight Yorke Stadium in Bacolet, Tobago, constructed for the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship, was named in Yorke&#x27;s honour. Yorke is a cricket fan. One of Yorke&#x27;s closest friends is Brian Lara. During the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Yorke made regular appearances bringing on drinks for the West Indies cricket team. Yorke&#x27;s older brother, Clint Yorke, is a former first-class cricketer who has represented the Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team as an opening batsman.

Yorke featured extensively in an episode of Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, which aired on 28 February 2006. The episode involved Yorke coaching the &quot;red team&quot; of contestants while they competed against the &quot;blue team&quot; in a game of football. Mark Rudan, Yorke&#x27;s Sydney FC teammate, was the manager of the &quot;blue team&quot;.

As a member of the squad that competed at the 2006 World Cup, Yorke was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago. He was also made a Sports Ambassador for the country.

Yorke released his autobiography, &quot;Born to Score&quot;, in 2009.

In December 2018, Yorke avoided bankruptcy by paying a £1.5 million debt to HM Revenue and Customs.

<doc id="526173" wikidata="Q179620" url="?curid=526173" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark">
<text>The convertible mark (, Cyrillic: &#x27;; [[Currency symbol|sign]]:KM; [[ISO 4217|code]]:BAM&quot;&#x27;) is the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is divided into 100 &#x27; or &#x27; (/) and locally abbreviated &quot;KM&quot;. While the currency and its subunits are uniform for both constituent polities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, namely the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS), the designs of the KM 10, KM 20, KM 50, and KM 100 banknotes are differentiated for each polity.

== History ==

The convertible mark was established by the 1995 Dayton Agreement. It replaced the Bosnia and Herzegovina dinar, Croatian kuna and Yugoslav novi dinar as the single currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1998. &quot;Mark&quot; refers to the Deutsche Mark, the currency to which it was pegged at par.

=== Etymology ===

The names derive from German. The three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian, have adopted the German nouns and as loanwords &quot;marka&quot; and &quot;pfenig&quot;. The Official Gazette of BiH ( ), Official newspaper of FBiH ( ) and other official documents recognised &quot;pfenig&quot; or пфениг (depending on the script; Serbian uses both Latin and Cyrillic equally, while Bosnian and Croatian uses only Latin) as the name of the subdivision. Most, however, consider the &quot;pf&quot; cluster in &quot;pfenig&quot; to be nigh unpronounceable, so the pronunciation was practically immediately reduced to &quot;fenig&quot;, which eventually gave rise to the &quot;fening&quot; misspelling.
Banknotes of 50 fenings circulated from 1998 to 2003. They were denoted &quot;50 KONVERTIBILNIH PFENIGA&quot; / &quot;50 КОНВЕРТИБИЛНИХ ПФЕНИГА&quot;; technically, the word &quot;convertible&quot; should not qualify the word &quot;pfenig&quot; because only the mark is convertible. &quot;(See Errors for all of the errors on banknotes and coins.)&quot; Coins of 10, 20, and 50 pfenigs have circulated since 1998 (the 5-pfenigs coin was released in 2006). All of them are inscribed &quot; / &quot; on the obverse. The misspelling / has never been corrected, and it took such a hold that it was officially adopted and not recognised as incorrect. Due to the overall confusion surrounding the foreign name of the currency, most people call the convertible mark simply &quot;marka&quot; (&quot;mark&quot;) while pfennigs are referred to as &quot;kovanice&quot; (&quot;nickels&quot;).

==== Plurals and cases ====

Serbo-Croatian is subject to a case system. For the purposes of pluralizing currency terms, three situations are relevant:

*In combination with numbers 1, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 101, 1001, et cetera (i. e. all numbers ending in &quot;1&quot; except 11), nouns use the nominative case singular (the base form):
::&quot;màrka&quot; and &quot;pfénig&quot;/&quot;féning&quot; 
*In combination with numbers whose final digit is 2, 3, or 4 (except 12, 13, and 14), nouns use the genitive case singular (the &quot;paucal form&quot;):
::&quot;màrke&quot; and &quot;pféniga&quot;/&quot;féninga&quot; 
*In combination with numbers 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 100, 1000, 10000, et cetera (i. e. all numbers ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 11, 12, 13, or 14), nouns use the genitive case plural:
::&quot;mȁrākā&quot; and &quot;pfénīgā&quot;/&quot;fénīngā&quot; 

For the pfenig, the plural is &quot;pfeniga&quot;/&quot;feninga&quot; with a short unaccented &quot;a&quot;, whereas the genitive plural is the same &quot;pfeniga&quot;/&quot;feninga&quot; but with a long unaccented &quot;i&quot; and &quot;a&quot;. A syllable after an accented syllable whose vowel is pronounced long and with a continuous tone, i. e. neither rising or falling, is said to have a genitive length (although the word does not necessarily have to be in the genitive case in order to have genitive length on its syllable; it can be in the locative also).

These matters should be noted when the local names are used in English. For example, the English plural &quot;ten pfenigas&quot; / &quot;ten feningas&quot; is incorrect because the final &quot;a&quot; in the BSC plural &quot;pfeniga&quot;/&quot;feninga&quot; already indicates the plural. Therefore &quot;ten pfenigs&quot; / &quot;ten fenings&quot; should be used. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) uses &quot;fenings&quot; as the English plural. Likewise, &quot;twenty-one markas&quot;, &quot;two markes&quot;, and &quot;twelve marakas&quot; are incorrect; &quot;twenty-one marks&quot;, &quot;two marks&quot;, and &quot;twelve marks&quot;, respectively, are correct.

== Coins ==

In December 1998, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 fenings. Coins of 5 fenings, KM 1, KM 2 and KM 5 were introduced later. The coins were designed by Bosnian designer Kenan Zekić and minted at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant (Wales, UK).

== Banknotes ==

In 1998, notes were introduced in denominations of 50 fenings, KM 1, KM 5, KM 10, KM 20, KM 50, and KM 100. KM 200 notes were added in 2002, while the 50-fening and KM 1 and KM 5 notes were later withdrawn from circulation. All current notes are valid throughout the nation.

The Central Bank of Bosnia Herzegovina issues the banknotes, with distinct designs for the constituent polities of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska,1 except for the largest denomination, i. e. the KM 200 note. The banknotes are legal tender throughout the country. On the notes for the Republika Srpska, inscriptions are printed first in Cyrillic and then Latin script, and vice versa. Banknotes, with the exception of the KM 200 note, are printed by the French company Oberthur.

===Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina issues===

===Republika Srpska issues===
===Nationwide issues===
The portraits of Ivan Franjo Jukić and Meša Selimović, which are both writers, were featured by consensus between both entities on all KM 1 and KM 5 notes used between 1998 and 2010.

On 15 May 2002, a KM 200 banknote, designed by Robert Kalina, was introduced during a promotion that was held in the Central Bank of BH. The reverse design which depicts a bridge is meant to resemble the euro banknotes, which were also designed by Robert Kalina. After an international tender, the Austrian company Oesterreichische Banknoten und Sicherheitsdruck GmbH (OeBS) in Vienna was chosen to print the notes. Initially, six million were ordered.

==Exchange rates==

Initially the mark was pegged to the Deutsche Mark at par. Since the replacement of the German mark by the euro in 2002, the Bosnian convertible mark uses the same fixed exchange rate to euro that the German mark had (that is, 

== Errors ==

Banknotes and coins of Bosnia and Herzegovina have many mistakes and inconsistencies.

Officially, only one banknote has not been released in circulation because of a mistake, even though other banknotes with mistakes had been issued.

=== Banknote examples ===

These are the most important mistakes that have been noticed to date:
* Both designs of the 50 fening banknote imprinted the adjective &quot;convertible&quot; next to the noun &quot;pfenig&quot;, although only the mark has the &quot;convertible&quot; prefix (&quot;50 KONVERTIBILNIH PFENIGA&quot; / &quot;50 КОНВЕРТИБИЛНИХ ПФЕНИГА&quot;).
* The KM 1 banknote for Republika Srpska was imprinted &quot;ИВО АНДРИЂ / IVO ANDRIĐ&quot; instead of &quot;ИВО АНДРИЋ / IVO ANDRIĆ&quot;. This banknote was immediately removed from circulation.
* Both designs of the KM 5 banknote had the Cyrillic word &quot;five&quot; incorrectly printed in Latin script on its reverse (&quot;PET КОНВЕРТИБИЛНИХ МАРАКА&quot;, instead of &quot;ПЕТ ...&quot;). Also, Meša Selimović&#x27;s name is written in Cyrillic as &quot;Меща Селимовић&quot; instead of &quot;Meша Селимовић&quot; (the letter &quot;щ&quot; is not even used in any of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina).
* The KM 10 banknote for Republika Srpska, first series, 1998, had Aleksa Šantić&#x27;s name printed in Latin script although it should have been printed in Cyrillic script as it is on all other examples of the 1998 series.
* Both designs of the KM 100 banknote were incorrectly printed with the Cyrillic abbreviation of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina with &quot;Џ / Dž&quot; instead of &quot;Ц / C&quot; (i. e. &quot;ЏББХ / DžBBH&quot; instead of &quot;ЦББХ / CBBH&quot;) in the safety bar.
* In 2017, Edin Bujak of the Department of Archaeology of the Faculty of Philosophy in Sarajevo noticed a mistake on the KM 10 banknote for the Federation of B&amp;H. The picture of the stećak on the reverse is actually a picture of a stećak from Križevići, Olovo and not from the Radimlja necropolis as stated on the banknote. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed this mistake, and it will be corrected in future printing of the banknote.

=== Coin examples ===
* The name of the subdivision of the convertible mark has been incorrectly engraved on coins: the word &quot;pfenig&quot; has been engraved as &quot;fening&quot;. This mistake has taken such a hold, especially because there were and are no 50 pfenig/fening banknotes in circulation, that &quot;fening&quot; was officially adopted as the name of the hundredth unit of the KM and is not recognized as incorrect.

<doc id="526180" wikidata="Q1571036" url="?curid=526180" title="Centreboard">
<text>A centreboard or centerboard (US) is a retractable hull appendage which pivots out of a slot in the hull of a sailboat, known as a &quot;centreboard trunk&quot; (UK) or &quot;centerboard case&quot; (US). The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of solely a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate; the term &quot;centreboard&quot; may refer to either a wooden or a metal pivoting retractable foil. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting.

The analog in a scow is a bilgeboard: these are fitted in pairs and used one at a time.

==General==
===History===
Lt. John Schank (c. 1740 – 6 February 1823) was an officer of the British Royal Navy and is credited with the invention of the centerboard. Schank, however, gave credit for the idea to British Brigadier General Earl Percy.

===Purpose===
A centreboard (often called a lifting foil in a modern racing dinghy) is used to provide lift to counter the lateral force from the sails. This is required for sailboats to move in directions other than downwind, since the force of the sail is never closer than 45 degrees to the apparent wind. Since most sailboats are symmetric along their axis of motion, when sailing upright, the lateral force can come from either side, which means that centreboards must use symmetric foil shapes so they will operate with equal efficiency on either tack. The more a yacht heels the more asymmetric its hull shape becomes.

The centerboard, daggerboard or bilgeboard can be used as a recovery platform upon which to stand, providing increased leverage, in the event the dinghy overturns via a capsize or turtle.

===How it works===
The efficiency of a centreboard improves with increasing aspect ratio. A long narrow centreboard produces less drag than a short, wide one for a given amount of lift, resulting in a faster boat that can point closer into the wind. A fore and aft, pivoting centreboard can also be used to move the centre of lateral resistance aft to match a change in sail plan, such as furling or dropping the jib. A retracting centreboard is more complex than a fixed keel, and most take up space inside the hull of the boat that could otherwise be used for passenger accommodation. Other types feature a casing under the boat, which does not take up space but instead has the problem of increased drag. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find boats with a combination of shallow keel and centreboard (e.g. Randmeer). The keel provides the housing for the centreboard, moving it out of the hull, but adds only a small amount of draft to the boat. The centreboard can then be lowered in deeper waters to increase the amount of lift. Ballast is usually provided in the keel, keeping the centreboard lighter and easier to handle.

Centreboards are often ballasted in keelboats and called &quot;lifting keels&quot; because like keels they are centred under the hull, although unlike keels, they are retractable. Ballasted centreboards are generally not locked in place when lowered; the mass of the ballast keeps them down. This also provides a measure of safety should the boat run aground—the force of impact will push the foil back into the centreboard trunk, rather than breaking it, as might happen if the board were locked in place. The mass of a ballasted foil means that a system of pulleys may be required to allow the sailor to lift the foil, and a method of latching the board in the upward position is needed. A centreboard differs from a ballast keel in that centreboards do not contribute to the stability of the vessel; their purpose is to provide lateral resistance. In small sailing dinghies it is rare to find a ballasted centreboard.

On larger sailing vessels, a similar design is sometimes incorporated to facilitate better navigation in shallow water than a fixed keel would allow. In these situations the appendage is generally referred to as a &quot;lifting keel&quot; (which is usually pivoted but occasionally retracted like a daggerboard) or a &quot;swing keel&quot;.

In such installations on offshore vessels, the keel should ideally be lockable in any position, so that it does not fall back into the keel well if the vessel is inverted.

When the craft is moving, the centreboard acts as a lifting foil.

<text>Unteruhldingen is a small village, part of the town of Uhldingen-Mühlhofen, on the northwestern shore of Lake Constance, Germany.
It is home to the Pfahlbauten, an open-air museum displaying reconstructions of Neolithic and Bronze Age pile dwellings. The buildings are idealized reconstructions from between the 1922 and 1941, which were designed based on archeological digs of the Wasserburg Buchau at Federsee. After 1945 the museum was led by the controversial but knowledgeable archeologist Hans Reinerth, one of the leading Nazi archaeologists of Amt Rosenberg. This museum has been expanded since to incorporate modern research.

<doc id="526182" wikidata="Q2068951" url="?curid=526182" title="Peninsular Ranges">
<text>The Peninsular Ranges (also called the Lower California province) are a group of mountain ranges that stretch from Southern California to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula; they are part of the North American Pacific Coast Ranges, which run along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Mexico. Elevations range from .

==Geography==

The Peninsular Ranges include the Santa Ana Mountains, the Temescal Mountains, other mountains and ranges of the Perris Block, the San Jacinto Mountains, the Laguna Mountains of southern California continuing from north to south with the Sierra de Juárez, the Sierra de San Pedro Mártir, the Sierra de San Borja, the Sierra de San Francisco, the Sierra de la Giganta, and the Sierra de la Laguna in Baja California. Palomar Mountain, home to Palomar Observatory, is in the Peninsular Ranges in San Diego County, as are the San Ysidro Mountains and Viejas Mountain. The Peninsular Ranges run predominantly north-south, unlike the Transverse Ranges to their north, which mostly run east-west.

==Geology==
Rocks in the ranges are dominated by Mesozoic granitic rocks, derived from the same massive batholith which forms the core of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. They are part of a geologic province known as the Salinian Block which broke off the North American plate as the San Andreas Fault and Gulf of California came into being.

Between the Peninsular Ranges and the Transverse Ranges lies the complex Malibu Coast—Santa Monica—Hollywood fault, which exists as the border between these two mostly geologically unitary provinces.

==Ecology and flora==

===Nearctic===

Most of the Peninsular Ranges are in the Nearctic realm. Several terrestrial ecoregions cover portions of the Peninsular Ranges. On the western side of the northern portion of the ranges, the montane sub-ecoregion of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion covers southern California and northern Baja California. On the western side of the southern portion of the ranges, the Baja California desert ecoregion covers the southern portion of the Peninsular Ranges in Baja California and Baja California Sur. On the eastern side of the northern ranges, the Sonoran Desert ecoregion covers southeastern California and northeastern Baja California as far south as the town of Loreto. On the eastern side of the Laguna Mountains in San Diego County, Anza-Borrego Desert State Park is known for its springtime profusion of Colorado Desert (Sonoran) wildflowers. On the eastern (Gulf of California) side of the southern portion of the ranges, the Gulf of California xeric scrub ecoregion covers the range in Baja California Sur.

The higher portions of the Peninsular Ranges, especially the west-facing slopes, are home to coniferous and mixed evergreen forests. Cleveland National Forest covers much of the higher Southern California Peninsular Ranges. The vegetation includes oak woodlands and forests of Jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;) and Coulter pine (&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot;). The Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests cover the upper slopes of the Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir ranges in Baja California. These isolated forests are predominantly composed of tamarack pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;murrayana&quot;), sugar pine (&quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot;), Parry pinyon &quot;(Pinus quadrifolia)&quot;, white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), California incense cedar (&quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;), and junipers. Oak species include coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), Engelmann oak (&quot;Quercus engelmannii&quot;), canyon live oak (&quot;Quercus chrysolepis&quot;), and Baja oak (&quot;Quercus peninsularis&quot;). These higher portions of the Peninsular Ranges harbor many rare and endemic species.
===Neotropic===
Southern Baja California Sur is part of the Neotropical realm. The southern end of the Baja California Peninsula, including the Sierra de la Laguna Peninsular Range, was, like the rest of the peninsula, originally part of the Mexican mainland. It was sheared off the mainland, becoming at one time an island, and evolved in relative isolation from the northern part of the peninsula and ranges. Its flora and fauna share many affinities with southern Mexico and Central America. It includes three distinct ecoregions, the Sierra de la Laguna dry forests, Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests, and San Lucan xeric scrub.

<doc id="526184" wikidata="Q840659" url="?curid=526184" title="Laser (dinghy)">
<text>The Laser is a class of single-handed, one-design sailing dinghies using a common hull design with three interchangeable rigs of different sail areas, appropriate to a given combination of wind strength and crew weight. Ian Bruce and Bruce Kirby designed the Laser in 1970 with an emphasis on simplicity and performance.

The Laser is a widely produced class of dinghies. As of 2018, there were more than 215,000 boats worldwide. It is an international class with sailors in 120 countries, and an Olympic class since 1996. Its wide acceptance is attributable to its robust construction, simple rig and ease of sailing that offer competitive racing due to tight class association controls which eliminate differences in hull, sails, and equipment.

The International Laser Class Association (ILCA) defines the specifications and competition rules for the boat, which is officially referred to as the ILCA Dinghy, due to a trademark dispute.

==Production==
The ILCA is manufactured by a number of different companies. As of April 2023 these were Devoti Sailing s.r.o., Czech Republic, Element 6 Evolution Co., Ltd., Thailand, Far East Boats, P. R. China, Nautivela srl, Italy, Ovington Boats Ltd, Great Britain, Performance Sailcraft Australia, Performance Sailcraft Japan, Rio Tecna srl, Argentina, and Qingdao Zou Inter Marine Co., Ltd., China. 

Laser dinghies are also manufactured by Laser Performance Europe in Portugal, but these boats are not licensed by World Sailing or the ILCA and are not eligible for ILCA events or the Olympic Games.

==Design==
The boat&#x27;s design began in 1969 with a phone call between Canadians Bruce Kirby and Ian Bruce. While discussing the possibility of a car-topped dinghy (a boat small enough to be carried on a roof rack of a typical car) for a line of camping equipment, Bruce Kirby sketched what would be known as &quot;the million dollar doodle&quot;. The plans stayed with Kirby until 1970 when One Design and Offshore Yachtsman magazine held a regatta for boats under $1000, called &quot;America&#x27;s Teacup&quot;. Hans Fogh made the sail and helmed the prototype in the regatta. After a few sail modifications, the Laser easily won its class. The prototype was originally named the &quot;Weekender&quot;; the sail held the letters TGIF, a common American abbreviation for &quot;Thank God it&#x27;s Friday&quot;. In December 1970 Dave Balfour, a McGill engineering student, suggested the name Laser and contributed the Laser sail insignia. The Laser sailboat was officially unveiled at the New York Boat Show in 1971 where many purchase orders were placed.

Bruce and Kirby agreed to put the boat into production with Bruce manufacturing the craft and Kirby receiving royalties on each unit. As world-wide demand grew, they realized that regional licensing the manufacturing would deliver boats more economically than exporting them from Canada.

The Laser hull accommodates interchangeable rigs with different sail areas. This allows for a wide range of sailors to sail and compete in a range of wind conditions despite the Laser&#x27;s small ideal crew weight range for a given rig. Three rigs are recognised by the International Laser Association: original Laser Standard with a sail area of 7.06 m²; the Laser Radial with a sail area of 5.76 m²; and the Laser 4.7 with a sail area of 4.7 m².

The Laser&#x27;s hull is constructed from fibreglass. The deck has a foam layer underneath for strength and buoyancy. The daggerboard is removable for storage and transport. The dinghy is manufactured by independent companies under licence in different parts of the world, including Performance Sailcraft Australia (Oceania) and Performance Sailcraft Japan.

As a one-design class of sailboat, all Lasers are built to the same specifications specified in the Laser Construction Manual. The association carries out inspections on manufacturers to ensure that boats are being made to the correct design. These factory specifications are the measurement of boats in a traditional sense. Sailors are prohibited from making any changes to the hull, sail, and spars unless specifically and positively permitted by the rules and are only allowed to use original parts. At regattas, boats are not measured, but rather inspected to ensure conformity with the rules.

The Laser hull is long, with a waterline length of . The hull weight is , which makes the boat light enough to lift onto a car-top rack.

The various sizes of Laser are all cat-rigged. The Laser Standard sail has a sail area of .

The Laser is designed to be sailed single-handed although class rules permit two sailors.

==Variants==
Lasers can be rigged with a variety of rigs. Three of these rigs, the Standard, Radial and 4.7 are recognised by the International Laser Association, while other rigs have also been developed by third parties and are also available.

===Laser Standard===

The Laser Standard, or ILCA 7, is the original Laser rig. It has been sailed as the Olympic men&#x27;s singlehanded dinghy since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.The Standard Laser uses a Portsmouth Yardstick of 1101for racing involving other classes. US Sailing sets its North American yardstick at DPN = 91.1.

===Laser Radial===

In Europe the smaller Laser Radial, or ILCA 6, has surpassed the original Laser Standard sail in popularity and replaced the Europe Dinghy as the Women&#x27;s Singlehanded Dinghy for the 2008 Olympics. The Radial uses the same hull and fittings as the Laser Standard, but has a smaller sail (5.8 m2) than the Standard with a different cut, and has a shorter lower mast section. Optimal weight for this rig is . The Laser Radial rig has a UK Portsmouth Yardstick number of 1150. Its DPN is 96.7.

===Laser 4.7===

A smaller sail plan for the Laser, the Laser 4.7 or ILCA 4, was developed about a decade after the Laser Radial. The sail area was reduced by 35% from the Standard (from ) with a shorter, pre-bent bottom mast section, allowing even lighter sailors to sail it. The same formula as the Radial is kept. The hull is the same as the Standard and Radial. The optimal weight for this rig is , thus becoming an ideal boat for young sailors moving from the Optimist/RS Tera who are still too light for a normal Laser. The Laser 4.7 rig has a UK Portsmouth Yardstick number of 1210. Its DPN is 95.4.

==Operational history==
The Laser is raced worldwide from club levels to international and Olympic competitions.

Laser world championships are held in all three rigs and across junior, open, and masters age groups. In total in 2019, the Laser class association awarded 11 world championships. Places for world championships are limited due to high demand and are allotted to countries on the basis of the number of paid association members in each country.

In the Olympics, men race in Laser Standards and women race in Laser Radials.

===Class association===
The International Laser Class Association (ILCA) governs boat specifications and competition. The class association operates on four levels: the world level; a regional level based around continents; a district level based around states in the USA and Australia, and nations elsewhere; and at a local fleet level. The association plays a major role in ensuring conformity to Laser class rules worldwide.

===Litigation===
Bruce Kirby withdrew the license he had issued to LaserPerformance and later filed a lawsuit against LaserPerformance and Farzad Rastegar on March 4, 2013, claiming non-payment of design royalties. Kirby also claims that the LaserPerformance boats have had issues with quality and parts availability. Kirby required the International Sailing Federation on March 25, 2013, to ask the International Laser Class Association to stop issuing ISAF license plaques to LaserPerformance (Europe) Limited, claiming that LaserPerformance were no longer a licensed builder. Instead ISAF and the ILCA issued a new plaque design, and changed the class rules so that a builder no longer needed to be licensed by Bruce Kirby.

In 2019 the ILCA moved against Laser Performance Europe (the UK licensed builder which is part of a group that also owned the trademark on the Laser name in much of the world) and withdrew its right to build officially measured boats. The ILCA has chosen the new name of &quot;ILCA Dinghy&quot; for the boat.

In 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut found boat builder Quarter Moon (QMI) and LaserPerformance (Europe) Limited (LPE) liable for a sum of $6,857,736, payable to Kirby.

<text>Neighborhoods in [[Berlin-Mitte]]: [[Cölln|Old Cölln]] [1] (with [[Museum Island]] [1a], [[Fischerinsel|Fisher Island]] [1b]), [[Alt-Berlin]] [2] (with [[Nikolaiviertel]] [2a]), [[Friedrichswerder]] [3], [[Neukölln am Wasser]] [4], [[Dorotheenstadt]] [5], [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]] [6], [[Luisenstadt]] [7], [[Stralauer Vorstadt]] (with [[Königsstadt]]) [8], [[Alexanderplatz]] Area (Königsstadt and Altberlin) [9], [[Spandauer Vorstadt]] [10] (with [[Scheunenviertel|Scheunenviertel [10a]]]), [[Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt]] [11], [[Oranienburger Vorstadt]] [12], [[Rosenthaler Vorstadt]] [13]

 (&quot;German&quot;: &quot;Barn Quarter&quot;) is a neighborhood of Mitte in the centre of Berlin. It is situated to the north of the medieval Altberlin area, east of the &quot;Rosenthaler Straße&quot; and &quot;Hackescher Markt&quot;. 

Until the Second World War it was regarded as a slum district and had a substantial Jewish population with a high proportion of migrants from Eastern Europe.

==History==
The name derives from several barns erected here outside the city walls in 1672 by order of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg. The barns were used to store hay for use at a large cattle market at nearby Alexanderplatz. In 1737 King Frederick William I of Prussia required Berlin Jews to settle here.

Prior to World War I, the Berlin City Council (&quot;Magistrat&quot;) redeveloped parts of the area. Since then the core of the neighborhood is the triangular Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, former &quot;Bülowplatz&quot;, where on 9 August 1931 the Communist and later Stasi Executive Erich Mielke shot two police officers. Mielke fled to Moscow shortly afterwards and did not face trial for the murders until 1992.

Since German reunification the Scheunenviertel, together with the neighbouring Spandauer Vorstadt, has become a fashionable district popular with younger people.

Note that Scheunenviertel is often mistakenly used as a synonym for Berlin&#x27;s Jewish quarter. Jewish cultural and commercial life was, however, centered on the neighboring Spandauer Vorstadt, where the New Synagogue and other Jewish establishments are located. The Nazis had applied the term &quot;Scheunenviertel&quot; to both of the neighborhoods in order to damage the Jewish neighborhood of Spandauer Vorstadt&#x27;s reputation.

<doc id="526200" wikidata="Q1056767" url="?curid=526200" title="The Masterplan (album)">
<text>The Masterplan is a compilation album by the English rock band Oasis. It was released on 2 November 1998 by Creation Records and was the band&#x27;s final release through the label. The album comprises B-sides that the band had not previously included on an album. Initially intended for release only in regions such as the United States and Japan, where the tracks were previously available only on expensive European-import singles, &quot;The Masterplan&quot; reached number 2 in the UK, where it initially went platinum, and number 51 in the United States. However, it reached the Top 20 in various charts worldwide, selling 3 million copies. It has since been certified triple platinum in the UK. Four songs from the album appear on the 2006 compilation album &quot;Stop the Clocks&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;The Masterplan&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics upon its release. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Barney Hoskyns criticised the collection as containing unimaginative songs, with the exceptions of &quot;Half the World Away&quot; and &quot;Headshrinker&quot;. Similarly, Matt Diehl of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the compilation as &quot;struttingly inconsistent&quot;, also criticising the band&#x27;s persistent use of Beatles influences. Conversely, Robert Hilburn in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; offered a more positive review, stating: &quot;virtually all the tunes on &quot;The Masterplan&quot; are appealing enough to have deserved a spot on one of Oasis&#x27; regular albums, and the best rank with the group&#x27;s finest moments.&quot; James Oldham of &quot;NME&quot; shared similar sentiments, noting that many of the B-sides in the collection were superior to the A-sides they were intended to support. He further observed that the collection highlighted the group&#x27;s influences, ultimately considering it the band&#x27;s &quot;third best album&quot;. In a 2000 review, Michael Sandlin of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was less favourable. While acknowledging that some tracks, such as &quot;Fade Away&quot; and &quot;Headshrinker&quot;, were better than certain studio album tracks, he criticised the overall collection as containing largely forgettable outtakes, remarking that &quot;some outtakes are initially scrapped for good reason&quot;.

Retrospectively, &quot;The Masterplan&quot; has received positive reviews, with many considering it one of Oasis&#x27; finest works. In 2008, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Marchese praised &quot;The Masterplan&quot; as a &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection, featuring &quot;swirling epics, pop-rock confections, [and] headbutt hard rockers&quot;. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine offered high praise for the album, stating: &quot;Apart from the sludgy instrumental &#x27;The Swamp Song&#x27;, there isn&#x27;t a weak track here, and the brilliant moments are essential not only for Oasis fans, but any casual follower of Britpop or post-grunge rock &amp; roll.&quot; On the eve of the collection&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2018, Ian King of &quot;Stereogum&quot; also praised &quot;The Masterplan&quot;. While he similarly found &quot;The Swamp Song&quot; to be the album&#x27;s weak point, he noted that the collection features many of the band&#x27;s best songs. Given the personnel changes the band would undergo following its release, King considers the compilation &quot;the last refuge of the band&#x27;s dreaming, climbing past; Manchester, Britpop, and all&quot;. In 2017, Henry Yates of &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;The Masterplan&quot; as Oasis&#x27; third best album, writing, &quot;by the time this compilation arrived in &#x27;98, it came laced with forehead-slapping frustration that Noel didn&#x27;t hold [these tracks] for a great third album&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In 2023, &quot;The Masterplan&quot; marked its 25th anniversary with a reissue, reaching #2 on the UK Albums Chart. Later in 2023, two songs from the album, &quot;The Masterplan&quot; and &quot;Going Nowhere&quot;, were re-recorded by Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds at Abbey Road Studios.

<text>Jónas Hallgrímsson (16 November 1807 – 26 May 1845) was an Icelandic poet, writer and naturalist. He was one of the founders of the Icelandic journal &quot;Fjölnir&quot;, which was first published in Copenhagen in 1835. The magazine was used by Jónas and his fellow &quot;Fjölnismenn&quot; to promote Icelandic nationalism, in the hope of giving impetus to the Icelandic Independence Movement. Jónas remains one of Iceland&#x27;s most beloved poets, penning some of the best-known Icelandic poems about Iceland and its people. Since 1996, Jónas&#x27;s birthday has been officially recognised in Iceland as the &quot;Day of the Icelandic Language&quot;. On 16 November each year, the &quot;Jónas Hallgrímsson Award&quot; is awarded to an individual for their outstanding contribution to the Icelandic Language.

==Biography==
Jónas was born in the north of Iceland, in Öxnadalur in Eyjafjörður. He was the son of Hallgrímur Þorsteinsson, a curate, and Rannveig Jónasdóttir. He was the third of their four children; his siblings were Þorsteinn (born 1800), Rannveig (born 1802) and Anna Margrét (born 1815). In 1816 Jónas&#x27; father drowned in a lake and Jónas was sent to live with his aunt. In 1821 he returned home to Öxnadalur to be confirmed, before going away to a school in Skagafjörður, where he was taught by the Reverend Einar H. Thorlacius. He studied there for two years, and won a scholarship to attend the school at Bessastaðir for a further six.

After passing his final examinations in 1829, Jónas moved to Reykjavík and was employed by a sheriff as a clerk, living in his home. During this time, he also worked as a defence lawyer. It is said that sometime in the winter of 1831–1832, Jónas proposed to a woman called Christiane Knudsen, but he was rejected. He was heartbroken.

In 1832 he sailed to Denmark, and passed the entrance exam for the University of Copenhagen. He began working for a law degree, but after four years switched to literature and natural sciences, excelling in both subjects. In 1835, along with fellow Icelandic students Brynjólfur Pétursson, Konráð Gíslason and Tómas Sæmundsson, he founded the patriotic journal &quot;Fjölnir&quot;.

After graduation he was awarded a grant from the state treasury to conduct scientific research in Iceland, a project which he worked on from 1839 to 1842. He continued to pursue his interest in the natural history of Iceland, and to work on &quot;Fjölnir&quot; throughout his life, dividing his time between Denmark and research trips to Iceland. It was in &quot;Fjölnir&quot; that many of his poems and essays first appeared. Jónas also worked as a translator of foreign material, including scientific works. In these can be found many of the Icelandic words coined by Jónas. One of these, for an example, is &quot;reikistjarna&quot;, meaning planet. This is a compound word from the verb &quot;að reika&quot; (to wander) and the noun &quot;stjarna&quot; (star).

On 21 May 1845 in Copenhagen, Jónas slipped on the stairs up to his room and broke his leg. He went to the hospital the next day, but died of blood poisoning, aged only 37.

==Style==
Jónas is considered one of the founding fathers, and best examples, of romanticism in Iceland. The imagery in his poetry was strongly influenced by the Icelandic landscape. He is also known for introducing foreign metres, such as pentameter, to Icelandic poetry.

:Charming and fair is the land,
::and snow-white the peaks of the jokuls [glaciers],
:Cloudless and blue is the sky,
::the ocean is shimmering bright,
:But high on the lave fields, where
::still Osar river is flowing
:Down into Almanna gorge,
::Althing no longer is held,
:Now Snorri&#x27;s booth serves as a sheepfold,
::the ling upon Logberg the sacred
:Is blue with berries every year,
::for children&#x27;s and ravens&#x27; delight.
:Oh, ye juvenile host
::and full-grown manhood of Iceland!
:Thus is our forefathers&#x27; fame
::forgotten and dormant withal.

==Controversy over Jónas&#x27; Remains==
In 1946, the bones of Jónas Hallgrímsson were moved from Copenhagen to Iceland in a controversy known in Icelandic as the &quot;beinamálið&quot; (&#x27;the case of the bones&#x27;). While ostensibly a national triumph, the reburial has been argued to have been an enormously problematic exercise in hegemony by Iceland&#x27;s post-independence elites and &quot;instead of uniting the nation, the episode uncovered a great divide within the people of Iceland&quot;. The main campaigner behind this was Sigurjón Pétursson, an admirer of Jónas who claimed to be in telepathic communication with the dead poet and wanted to re-bury his remains in Öxnadalur, where Jónas grew up. Sigurjón came up against serious opposition from a number of the political élite, including Ólafur Thors, who was then Prime Minister of Iceland. The government informed him that Jónas&#x27; bones were state property, and would be buried at the national burial ground at Þingvellir, alongside the poet Einar Benediktsson.

However, the government proved unwilling to finance the excavation and transportation. Sigurjón covered most of the cost, even paying for Matthías Þórðarson, the director of the National Museum, to oversee the excavation. The process was a lengthy one, because a father and son had been buried on top of Jónas in 1875, and another couple in 1900, and they needed to be excavated first.

Finally, Sigurjón was able to transport the remains to Iceland. He drove north with them, intending to bury them in Öxnadalur in defiance of the government, but the priests there refused to perform the rites. The coffin stood in a church for a week before being driven back south and buried in the government&#x27;s chosen spot on 16 November, Jónas&#x27; birthday. Since 1996, the date has been celebrated in Iceland as Icelandic Language Day.

The controversy, its motivations and outcomes were satirised by, amongst others, Halldór Laxness&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;Atómstöðin&quot; and Milan Kundera&#x27;s &quot;Ignorance&quot;.

<text>The Louisiade Archipelago is a string of ten larger volcanic islands frequently fringed by coral reefs, and 90 smaller coral islands in Papua New Guinea.

It is located 200 km southeast of New Guinea, stretching over more than and spread over an ocean area of between the Solomon Sea to the north and the Coral Sea to the south. The aggregate land area of the islands is about , with Vanatinai (Tagula) being the largest.

Rogeia, Samarai and Sariba lie closest to New Guinea, while Misima, Vanatinai, and Rossel islands lie further east.

== History ==
The islands were discovered by a Spanish expedition led by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606, that was part of the Fernandez de Quiros fleet which had sailed from South America in search of Australia. The Torres expedition visited various islands including Basilaki Island, which he named &quot;San Buenaventura&quot; in July 1606. It is possible that Malay and Chinese sailors also visited the islands earlier. More than a century later, in 1768, Louis Antoine de Bougainville visited the islands and named them for Louis XV, the king of France. Visits were also paid by Admiral Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux in 1793 and Captain Owen Stanley in 1849.

The 1942 Battle of Coral Sea was fought nearby, after Japanese occupation in the same year. The Deboyne Islands were the site of the 1942 Raids on Deboyne.

== Rain forests ==
The islands have a moist tropical climate, and are largely covered with tropical moist broadleaf forests. The Louisiade Archipelago rain forests form a distinct ecoregion, and are home to a number of endemic species, including several endemic trees (in genera &quot;Pandanus, Diospyros,&quot; and &quot;Hopea&quot;), as well as five endemic frog species, two endemic lizard species, and five endemic bird species.

==Government==
The archipelago is divided into the Local Level Government (LLG) areas Bwanabwana Rural (western part, with Basilaki), Louisiade Rural (central part, with Misima), and Yaleyamba (eastern part, with Rossel and Vanatinai islands). The LLG areas are part of Samarai-Murua District of Milne Bay. The seat of the Louisiade Rural LLG is Bwagaoia on Misima Island, the population center of the archipelago.
The seat of the Yaleyamba is changed every couple of years between Rambuso and Jingo (Rossell).
The seat of the Bwanabwana was Samarai from the Louisiade archipelago, but was recently transferred to the mainland of Papua New Guinea to the city of Alotau.

== Islands ==
The Louisiade Archipelago consists of the following island groups and islands:

<doc id="526207" wikidata="Q845929" url="?curid=526207" title="Pretender">
<text>A pretender is someone who claims to be the rightful ruler of a country although not recognized as such by the current government. The term may often be used to either refer to a descendant of a deposed monarchy or a claim that is not legitimate.

In addition, it may also refer to that of a deposed monarch, a type of claimant referred to as head of a house. In addition, it may also refer to a former monarchy.

Queen Anne popularized this word, using it to refer to her Roman Catholic half-brother James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite heir, in an address to Parliament in 1708: &quot;The French fleet sailed from Dunkirk ... with the Pretender on board.&quot;

In 1807 the French Emperor Napoleon complained that the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; continued to list German princes whom he had deposed. This episode established that publication as the pre-eminent authority on the titles of deposed monarchs and nobility, many of which were restored in 1815 after the end of Napoleon&#x27;s reign.

== Etymology ==
The noun &quot;pretender&quot; is derived from the French verb &quot;prétendre,&quot; itself derived from the Latin &quot;praetendere&quot; (&quot;to stretch out before&quot;, &quot;to hold before (as a pretext)&quot;, &quot;to extend [a claim] before&quot;), from the verb &quot;tendo&quot; (&quot;to stretch&quot;), plus the preposition &quot;prae&quot; (&quot;before, in front&quot;). The English, French and Latin words have &quot;prima facie&quot; no pejorative connotation, although one who pretends to a position with no plausible claim or with an entirely false claim, may be differentiated as a &quot;false pretender&quot;, see for example Perkin Warbeck.

==Roman Empire==
Ancient Rome knew many pretenders to the offices making up the title of Roman emperor, especially during the Crisis of the Third Century.

These are customarily referred to as the Thirty Tyrants, which was an allusion to the Thirty Tyrants of Athens some five hundred years earlier; although the comparison is questionable, and the Romans were separate aspirants, not (as the Athenians were) a Committee of Public Safety. The Loeb translation of the appropriate chapter of the Augustan History therefore represents the Latin &quot;triginta tyranni&quot; by &quot;Thirty Pretenders&quot; to avoid this artificial and confusing parallel. Not all of them were afterwards considered &quot;pretenders&quot;; several were actually successful in becoming emperor at least in part of the empire for a brief period.

==Greek pretenders==

===Byzantine Empire===
Successions to the Roman Empire long continued at Constantinople. Most seriously, after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and its eventual recovery by Michael VIII Palaiologos, there came to be three Byzantine successor states, each of which claimed to be the Roman Empire, and several Latin claimants (including the Republic of Venice and the houses of Montferrat and Courtenay) to the Latin Empire the Crusaders had set up in its place. At times, some of these states and titles were subjected to multiple claims.

===Cypriot pretenders===
Following the defeat and death of King James III King of Cyprus in 1474, his younger and illegitimate brother, Eugène Matteo de Lusignan, also styled &quot;d&#x27;Arménie&quot; (died 1523) removed to Sicily, then to Malta. He was acknowledged as rightful heir to the thrones of Cyprus, Armenia, Jerusalem, and Antioch, although he never made serious efforts to pursue the claims. The title of &quot;Barone de Baccari&quot; was created in 1508 for Jacques Matteo (sives Eugene Matteo) d&#x27;Armenia with the remainder to his descendants in perpetuity. Eugene, illegitimate son of King Jacques II of Cyprus, had, when his family were exiled, first gone to Naples, then Sicily, then settled on Malta, marrying a Sicilian heiress, &quot;Donna&quot; Paola Mazzara (a descendant of the Royal House of Aragon of Sicily and Aragon), with issue.

===Modern Greece===

The claimant to the throne of the last Greek kingdom is Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece. He belongs to the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the senior branch of the House of Oldenburg. His designated heir is his son Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark.

==French pretenders==

The establishment of the First Republic and the execution of Louis XVI in 1793 led to the king&#x27;s son becoming pretender to the abolished throne, styled as Louis XVII. As Louis XVII was a child and imprisoned in Paris by the revolutionaries, his uncle, the Comte de Provence, proclaimed himself regent in his nephew&#x27;s name. After Louis XVII died in 1795, the Comte de Provence became pretender himself, as Louis XVIII.

Louis XVIII was restored to the throne in 1814, and was succeeded by his brother Charles X in 1824. Charles X was, however, forced into exile by the July Revolution. Charles X and his son, Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, abdicated their claims in favor of Charles&#x27;s grandson, Henri, Count of Chambord; however, their cousin the Duke of Orléans, a descendant of Louis XIV&#x27;s younger brother, mounted the throne as Louis Philippe I, King of the French.

For most of the July Monarchy, the legitimists, as supporters of the exiled senior line came to be known, were uncertain of whom to support. Some believed the abdication of Charles and his son legal, and recognized the young Chambord as king, while others maintained that abdication was unconstitutional in France of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, and continued to recognize first Charles X and then Louis-Antoine, until the latter&#x27;s death in 1844. On his uncle&#x27;s death, Chambord claimed the crown, but lived in exile and upon his death in 1883, the direct male-line of Louis XV became extinct.

In 1848, Louis Philippe was himself overthrown by the February Revolution, and abdicated the throne in favor of his young grandson, Philippe, Comte de Paris. However, a republic was proclaimed, leaving Paris, like his cousin Chambord, merely a pretender to a no longer existing crown. Over the next several decades, there were several attempts at a so-called &quot;fusion&quot;, to unite both groups of monarchists in support of the childless Chambord as king, who would recognize the Count of Paris as his heir. Those efforts failed in the 1850s, but after the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870, when a royalist majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, fusion again became the monarchist strategy. As a result, in 1873 the Count of Paris withdrew his own bid for the throne and recognized Chambord as legitimate pretender to the French crown. In spite of this apparent unity among royalist forces, of the monarchy was not to be; Chambord refused to accept the Tricolor flag, which rendered him unacceptable to most Frenchmen as a constitutional king. The monarchists hoped that after Chambord&#x27;s death they could unite and crown the Orléanist candidate. But Chambord lived until 1883, while France&#x27;s royalists had lost their majority in parliament by 1877. The erstwhile Orléanist Adolphe Thiers thus called Chambord &quot;The French Washington&quot;, i.e. the true &quot;founder&quot; of the Republic.

By 1883 most French monarchists accepted the Count of Paris as head of royal house. A minority of reactionaries, the so-called &quot;Blancs d&#x27;Espagne&quot; (&quot;Spanish Whites&quot;), continued to withhold support from the House of Orléans and chose instead Juan, Count of Montizon, the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, who also happened to be the senior male descendant of Louis XIV.

The arguments are, on one side, that Louis XIV&#x27;s younger grandson, Philip de Bourbon, Duke of Anjou renounced any future claim to the French throne when he left France to become king of Spain as Philip V in 1700 (the renunciation was ratified internationally by the Treaty of Utrecht), ostensibly leaving the Dukes of Orléans as heirs to the throne of France in the event of extinction of descendants of Louis XIV&#x27;s elder grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy, which occurred in 1883. On the other side, Anjou&#x27;s renunciation is held to be invalid because prior to the revolution it was a fundamental tenet of the French monarchy that the crown could never be diverted from the rightful (senior line) heir of Hugh Capet. Moreover, although the Orléans volunteered to defer their rival claim to the throne after 1873, the regicidal vote of their ancestor Philippe Égalité in 1789 and the usurpation of Louis Philippe in 1830 are alleged to have extinguished all rights to the throne for the Orléans branch. The schism has continued to the present day, with supporters of the senior line reclaiming the title of &quot;Legitimist&quot;, leaving their opponent royalists to be known, once again, as &quot;Orléanists&quot;. The current representative of the senior line is Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, the senior legitimate living descendant of Hugh Capet (and of Philip V &quot;d&#x27;Anjou&quot; of Spain) who was born and raised in Spain. The Orléanist line, which returned to live in France when the law of banishment was repealed in 1950, is represented by Prince Jean, Duke of Vendôme, senior male-line descendant of King Louis Philippe.

In addition to these two claims to the historic royal throne of France, there have also been pretenders to the imperial throne of France, created first by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804 and recreated by his nephew Emperor Napoleon III in 1852 (abolished 1870). This claim is today disputed between Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon and his own father, the self-avowed republican Prince Charles Napoléon (deemed to be excluded from the succession due to a non-dynastic re-marriage), both descendants of Napoleon I&#x27;s youngest brother, Jérôme Bonaparte.

==Russian pretenders==

There is much debate over who is the legitimate heir to the Russian throne, and bitter dispute within the family itself. Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna is considered by some to be the legitimate heir. She is the only child of Grand Duke Vladimir who died in 1992, a great-grandson of Tsar Alexander II, whom some considered the last male dynast of the House of Romanov. Some of her opponents believe she is ineligible to claim the throne because she was born of a marriage that would have been deemed morganatic under Russia&#x27;s monarchy, which was abolished in 1917. Others oppose her for reasons similar to those of the anti-Orleanist rationale: her grandfather&#x27;s perceived disloyalty and dynastic ambition are seen as removing any rights which might otherwise have belonged to her branch of the former dynasty.

Still others maintain that the restrictive, pre-revolutionary marital rules of the Romanovs leave no one who can claim to be rightful heir to the dynasty&#x27;s legacy. Others recognized Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia as head of the family, being a descendant of Emperor Nicholas I and the elected president of the Romanov Family Association, which consists of most living male-line descendants of the Romanov emperors. Neither he nor his younger brother, Prince Dimitri Romanov, had sons and since their deaths no new claims have been advanced by this branch.

Anna Anderson attempted to prove she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the lost daughter of Nicholas II, but DNA testing on her remains eventually proved her to be an impersonator. Although she did not claim the throne, &quot;per se&quot;, as women could not succeed to the Russian throne so long as any male dynast survived, she became more famous than any of the various Romanov claimants to the throne.
Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (born 1952), who converted to the Eastern Orthodoxy in 2013, is the latest pretender to the Russian throne under the name of Prince Nikolai Kirillovich of Leiningen. He is the grandson of Grand Duchess Maria Cyrillovna of Russia, (sister of Vladimir, and aunt of Maria Vladimirovna), and great-grandson of Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. The Monarchist Party of Russia supports Prince Nikolai as the heir of the Russian throne, since they are of the opinion that Maria Vladimirovna Romanova and Nicholas Romanov are not dynasts. In early 2014, Nikolai Kirilovich declared himself &quot;Emperor Nicholas III&quot; (successor to Nicholas II).

In 2007 Nicholas married Countess Isabelle von und zu Egloffstein and in 2010 had a son, Emich.

==Spanish pretenders==

The Carlist line has claimed the throne of Spain after Ferdinand VII was succeeded by his daughter Isabella II instead of his brother Infante Carlos María Isidro, Count of Molina. Their claim was defended in several wars during the 19th centuries. Following the death of the last senior-line claimant, Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime in 1936, Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma became regent and later claimed the throne as &quot;Javier I&quot;. However, following the death of Xavier in 1977, the Carlist succession was in disarray as the heir, Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma, held left-wing socialist views that were viewed as incompatible with Carlism, and thus an incompatible claimant, leaving his younger, more conservative brother the Duke of Aranjuez as a rival claimant. As of 2024, the two legitimate claimants to the Carlist succession are Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Duke of Aranjuez and his nephew Prince Carlos, Duke of Parma and Piacenza.

==British pretenders==

===England, Scotland and Ireland===
After the execution by the English Parliament of Stuart King Charles I in 1649, his son Charles II was proclaimed king in Scotland (where he was crowned in 1651) and Ireland; but those two countries were invaded by English forces and annexed to the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell in 1653. Thus, Charles II was pretender to the throne of England from 1649 to the restoration of 1660, and exiled/deposed King of Scots and King of Ireland, 1653 to 1660. He died in 1685 and his brother James II and VII came to the throne. He had converted to Catholicism but this only became a worry when his second wife bore a son who would precede his two Protestant daughters. James was thus deposed by his elder daughter and his son-in-law (who was also his nephew, son of his sister Mary) during the Glorious Revolution in December 1688; they were formally offered the English and Scottish thrones by their respective parliaments a month later – which was still 1688 in England (where New Year&#x27;s Day was 25 March until 1752) but was already 1689 in Scotland (which adopted 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day in 1600). James made several attempts to regain the throne before his death in 1701, the most important of which was an effort he made with Irish support – that country having not yet acceded to the succession of William and Mary – which led to the Battle of the Boyne and the Battle of Aughrim, and set the stage for the subsequent Jacobite risings (or rebellions). These were a series of uprisings or wars between 1688 and 1746 in which supporters of James, his son (&quot;The Old Pretender&quot;) and grandson (&quot;The Young Pretender&quot;) attempted to restore his direct male line to the throne.

* James Francis Edward Stuart, the Roman Catholic son of the deposed James II and VII, was barred from the succession to the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701. Notwithstanding the Act of Union 1707, he claimed the separate thrones of Scotland, as James VIII, and of England and Ireland, as James III, until his death in 1766. In Jacobite terms, Acts of Parliament (of England or Scotland) after 1688 (including the Acts of Union) did not receive the required royal assent of the legitimate Jacobite monarch and, therefore, were without legal effect. James was responsible for a number of conspiracies and rebellions, particularly in the Highlands of Scotland. The most notable was the Jacobite rising of 1715–16.
* Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;), James Francis&#x27; elder son and the would-be Charles III, who led in his father&#x27;s name the last major Jacobite rebellion, the Jacobite rising of 1745–46. He died in 1788 without legitimate issue.
* Henry Benedict Stuart (best known as the Cardinal-Duke of York), the younger brother of Charles Edward and a Roman Catholic Cardinal, who took up the claim to the throne as the would-be Henry IX of England, though he was the final Jacobite heir to publicly do so. He died unmarried in 1807.

After 1807, the line of James VII and II became extinct. The Jacobites had ceased to have much political significance after the failure of the 1745 uprising, and the movement essentially became completely dormant after Henry&#x27;s death. Genealogically, the next most senior line to the English and Scottish thrones was through James II&#x27;s youngest sister, Henriette Anne, whose daughter had married into the House of Savoy. To the very limited extent that Jacobitism survived the death of Cardinal York, they supported the claims of this line. Its current representative is Franz, Duke of Bavaria, though he himself does not claim the title, his secretary having announced once that &quot;HRM (sic) is very content being a Prince of Bavaria&quot;.

Other pretenders to the throne have included:
* Lambert Simnel () was a pretender to the throne of England. His claim to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick in 1487 threatened the newly established reign of King Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509).
* Perkin Warbeck, a Fleming who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, and tried twice to invade England and capture the throne in the late 15th Century.
* Simon Abney-Hastings, 15th Earl of Loudoun, (1974- ) Australian Peer and head of the House of York. Member of the Abney-Hastings family; also known as &quot;King Simon I&quot;.

===Wales===

Owain Glyndŵr (1349–1416) is probably the best-known Welsh pretender, though whether he was pretender or Prince of Wales depends upon one&#x27;s source of information. Llywelyn ap Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who died in 1282, was the only Prince of Wales whose status as ruler was formally recognised by the English Crown, though three of the four men who claimed the throne of Gwynedd between the assumption of the title by Owain Gwynedd in the 1160s and the loss of Welsh independence in 1283 also used the title or similar. Madog ap Llywelyn also briefly used the title during his revolt of 1294–95. Since 1301, the title of Prince of Wales has been given to the eldest living son of the King or Queen Regnant of England (subsequently of Great Britain, 1707, and of United Kingdom, 1801). The word &quot;living&quot; is important. Upon the death of Arthur, Prince of Wales, Henry VII invested his second son, the future Henry VIII, with the title. The title is not automatic, however, but merges into the Crown when a prince dies or accedes to the throne, and has to be re-conferred by the sovereign.

Nevertheless, it is Glyndŵr whom many remember as the last native Prince of Wales. He was indeed proclaimed Prince of Wales by his supporters on 16 September 1400, and his revolt in quest of Welsh independence was not quashed by Henry IV until 1409. Later, however, one of Glyndŵr&#x27;s cousins, Owain Tudor, would marry the widow of Henry V, and their grandson would become Henry VII, from whom the current British monarch is descended (through his daughter Margaret Tudor, who married James IV of Scotland).

The various minor kingdoms that came together to form what is today known as the Principality of Wales each had their own royal dynasty. The most important of these realms were Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth. After 878 the ruling dynasties in these kingdoms each claimed descent from the sons of Rhodri Mawr who had conquered them or otherwise achieved their thrones during his reign. Merfyn Frych, the father of Rhodri Mawr, had come to power in Gwynedd because the native dynasty, known as the &quot;House of Cunedda&quot; had expired. Merfyn was descended from royalty through his own father Gwriad and claimed ancestors from among the rulers of British Rheged (in particular Llywarch Hen). It was acknowledged by all of the realms of Wales after the time of Rhodri Mawr that the House of Gwynedd (known as the House of Aberffraw) was senior and homage should be paid by each of them to the king of Gwynedd. After the reign of Owain ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd the realm began to merge with the concept of a &quot;Principality of Wales&quot;. This was realised by Owain&#x27;s descendant Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1267. It was not to last and this new Wales was invaded by England and dismantled between 1277 and 1284. All of the descendants of Llywelyn &quot;the last&quot; and his brothers were either imprisoned or killed.

==Irish pretenders==
The business of Irish pretenders is rather more complicated because of the nature of kingship in Ireland before the Norman take-over of 1171. In both Ireland and early Gaelic Scotland, succession to kingship was elective, often (if not usually) by contest, according to a system known as Tanistry.

The High King of Ireland (&quot;Ard Rí&quot;) was essentially a ceremonial, federal overlord, who exercised actual power only within the realm which was his dynastic seat. Because of the laws of succession, there could not be a pretender to this title in the sense it is normally understood. From the 5th century onwards the kingship tended to remain within the dynasty of the Uí Néill until Brian Boru of Munster wrested control of much of Ireland from Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill in 1002. Following his death in 1014 and that of Máel Sechnaill in 1022, the struggle for dominance resulted in Norman intervention from Henry II of England in 1171.

There were later attempts by Irish rulers fighting against the Normans to revive the High Kingship such as in 1258 when Brian Ua Néill of Cenel Eoghan was so acknowledged, in 1262 when the crown was offered to Haakon IV of Norway and in 1315 when an offer was made to the Scottish Edward Bruce. Effectively, the title fell into abeyance. Apart from the coronation oath, the title was not even used by the Kings of England, each of whom styled himself &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot;. In 1542 Henry VIII, styled himself &quot;King of Ireland&quot;.

Some Irish rebels discussed offering the Irish throne to Prince Joachim of Prussia (son of Kaiser Wilhelm II) before the 1916 Easter Rising. After the failure of the Rising, the royalists were a minority among the rebels, and so the offer was never made. According to Hugo O&#x27;Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan, Éamon de Valera raised the idea of an Irish monarchy with his great-grandfather Juan O&#x27;Donnell.

==Ottoman pretenders==

Cem Sultan, eldest of the sons of Mehmet the Conqueror born during his reign, claimed the Sultanate after the death of his father; he was defeated in battle months later by his eldest brother (by birth) Bayezid II. He fled to the island of Rhodes, then eventually to the Papal States. His descendants claimed his rights until the Knights Hospitaller defeated the Ottomans in the 16th century. After the Ottoman Empire was abolished and the Republic of Turkey came into power, the successive heads of the Ottoman family claimed the throne of the Ottoman Empire. The latest pretender to the Imperial House of Osman is Harun Osman, since 18 January 2021.

== Brazilian pretenders ==
After the abolition of the Empire of Brazil in 1889 by a military coup d&#x27;état that gave rise to the First Brazilian Republic, the current most recognised pretender to the Brazilian throne is Bertrand of Orléans-Braganza. He is the head of the called &quot;Vassouras branch&quot; of the Imperial Family, since it was divided after the resignation of his great-uncle Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará in 1908. The descendants of Pedro de Alcântara did not accept his resignation and maintained an active claim to the throne until the death of his elder son, Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza in 2007, whose claim passed to his son, Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza, head of the &quot;Petrópolis branch&quot;.

==Kingdom of Jerusalem==
The Emperors of Ethiopia held the title of &quot;King of Zion&quot; through their claim of descent from the Biblical House of David through his son King Solomon. Menelik II dropped the use of this title. The Ethiopian Emperors continued to use the honorific of &quot;Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah&quot; up until the monarchy ended with the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.

Since the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, many European rulers have claimed to be its rightful heir. None of these, however, have actually ruled over a part of the former Kingdom. Today there are several potential European claimants on the basis of the inheritance of the title. None of the claimants have any power in the area of the former Kingdom.

==Asian pretenders==
===Japan===
In the fourteenth century, two lines of the Imperial clan, Northern Court and Southern Court, claimed the throne. Their rivalry was resolved in 1392: while every emperor of the Southern Court enthroned prior to 1392 was established as legitimate, the throne was determined by Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Northern Court and his successors.

Since 1911, the Japanese government has declared the southern claimants were actually the rightful emperors despite the fact that all subsequent emperors including the then-Emperor Meiji were descended from the Northern Court, reasoning the Southern Court retained possession of the Three Sacred Treasures, thus converting the emperors of the former Northern court into mere pretenders. In other words, six former emperors of the Northern Court have been counted as pretenders instead since then. As a result of this compromise, the present Japanese Imperial Family is descended from the Northern Court Emperors.

Kumazawa Hiromichi publicly challenged Emperor Hirohito, disputing the legitimacy of his bloodline. Kumazawa claimed to be the 19th direct descendant of Emperor Go-Kameyama, the last Emperor of the Southern Court.

===Singapore===
Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor ceded the territory of Singapore to the British in the 19th century, but their descendants lived in the former royal palace until expelled by the government. They now live in obscurity.

==Heraldry==
Pretence is demonstrated in heraldry by placing on the shield of the pretender an inescutcheon of the arms of the former holder of the title pretended to, known as an &quot;inescutcheon of pretence&quot;. As well as being used by royalty, the inescutcheon of pretence is also used by English aristocratic and gentry families where a husband of an heraldic heiress (i.e. a daughter with no brothers) will display his wife&#x27;s paternal arms on an inescutcheon placed within his own coat of arms. Following the husband&#x27;s death the couple&#x27;s son and heir will remove the inescutcheon and show it instead as a quartering. 

==False pretenders==

Throughout history people have claimed fraudulently to be displaced monarchs or heirs who had disappeared or supposedly died under mysterious circumstances.
Some of them were look-alikes.
Such false pretenders include:
* Bertrand of Rais (or Ray), who claimed to be Baldwin I of Constantinople
* Thomas the Slav, who claimed to be the blinded Byzantine Emperor Constantine VI
* Lambert Simnel, who claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick
* Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York
* Gabriel de Espinosa, one of four people who claimed to be Sebastian of Portugal
* Yemelyan Pugachev, who claimed to be Peter III of Russia
* False Dmitry I, actually reigned as Tsar of Russia for nearly a year before he was killed in a riot
**False Dmitry II
**False Dmitry III
* Kaspar Hauser, who was claimed to be the stillborn son of Karl, Grand Duke of Baden
* False Margaret, who claimed to be Margaret, Maid of Norway
* Bou Hmara, who claimed to be a Sultan of Morocco
* False Olaf, who claimed to be Olaf II of Denmark

<doc id="526211" wikidata="Q315470" url="?curid=526211" title="Reichsdeutsche">
<text> (, literally translated ), is an archaic term for those ethnic Germans who resided within the German state that was founded in 1871. In contemporary usage, it referred to German citizens, the word signifying people from the German [[Reichsdeutsche|&#x27;]], i.e., Imperial Germany or&#x27;, which was the official name of Germany between 1871 and 1949.

The opposite of the &#x27; is, then, depending on context and historical period,&#x27;, &#x27; (however, usually meaning German citizens living abroad), or a more specific term denoting the area of settlement, such as [[Baltic Germans]] or [[Volga Germans]] (&#x27;).

==Term==
The key problem with the terms &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot; (of German descent, as to citizenship or ethnicity), and related ones is that the usage of the words often depends on context, i.e. who uses them where and when. There are, in that sense, no general legal or &quot;right&quot; definitions, although during the 20th century, all terms acquired legal — yet also changing — definitions.

The reason for the differentiation is that there has been a historical shift in the meaning of what belonging to a nation means. Until the early 19th century, a demonym such as &quot;German&quot; — apart from the &#x27; vernacular — was not too meaningful, although at least since the German Campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, the concept certainly existed. If anything, it was more seen as a cultural concept. The idea of a &#x27;, as advocated by philosophers like (1744–1803) and (1762–1814), includes German first language, religion (in different forms), and already sometimes German origin, descent or race in a vague sense.

With the 1871 unification of Germany under Prussian leadership, the concept of the German people first acquired a legal-political meaning, which they have retained until now. However, the German Empire as a &quot;Lesser German&quot; answer to the German Question, did not encompass more than two thirds of the German &#x27; (language area). For someone who considered themselves German but living abroad, e.g., in multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary, &#x27; meant any German who was a citizen of the German , as opposed to someone living abroad (and usually without a German passport). Part of the identity of ethnic German minorities living abroad — a classic example are the Baltic Germans — was to define themselves as German, using the pre-1871 concept. However, &quot; visiting the Russian Baltic governorates in the late 19th century, for instance, resented the claims of the Baltic Germans to be German — for the Germans from the Reich, to be German meant to be a German citizen, while for the Baltic Germans, it meant cultural-historical belonging.

It was however not until the German nationality law (&#x27;) of 1913 finally established the citizenship of the German Reich, whereas earlier political rights (including the claim to receive identity papers and passports) derived from one&#x27;s citizenship of one of the States of the German Empire. The citizens of some German states comprised also autochthonous or immigrant ethnic minorities of other than German ethnicity, which is why citizens of the German Empire always also comprised people of other ethnicity than the German (e.g. Danish, French, Frisian, Polish, Romani, Sorbian etc.). German citizenship is passed on from parent to child (&#x27;) whatever their ethnicity is. With naturalisation of aliens as German citizens, however, their eventual German ethnicity formed or still forms an advantage under certain circumstances (see &quot;).

In Nazi Germany, the &#x27; of 1935, part of the Nuremberg Laws established the legal status of &#x27;, i.e. German citizens &quot;of German or congeneric blood&quot;. As a result, Jews and &quot;&quot; officially became second-class citizens.

After World War II and the establishment of the West German Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, the analogous terms &#x27; (i.e., Federal Germans) and &#x27; (i.e., Federal citizens) were colloquially used to distinguish &#x27; citizens from people entitled to German citizenship, but as a matter of fact unwilling or unable to exercise it, such as citizens of East Germany (&#x27;) and East Berlin, or of the Saar Protectorate.

<text>The International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) is an annual academic competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads. The first IChO was held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former Eastern bloc and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in Austria. Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.

==About==
The International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) is an annual competition for the world’s most talented chemistry students at the secondary school level. Nations around the world send a team of four students who are tested on their chemistry knowledge and skills in a five-hour laboratory practical exam and a five-hour written theoretical examination that are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. Countries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive Olympiads before their students can participate in the event. Presently, around 80 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.

All participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to the top 12% of students, silver medals are awarded to the next 22% of students, and bronze medals are awarded to the next 32% of students. Honorable mentions are awarded to the top 10% of non medalist participants. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall. Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.

==Structure and rules== 

Each delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or &quot;head mentor&quot;). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in Bratislava, Slovakia.

Countries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 90 countries are expected to send students.

The competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant&#x27;s overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students&#x27; preference.

Students receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.

The syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of chemistry, including organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and spectroscopy. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.

These events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, &quot;the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding&quot;.

==Preparation==

 each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold &quot;training camps&quot; for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year&#x27;s preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.

==History==
The idea of the International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all Warsaw Pact countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.

The first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.

There was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.

In 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.

The first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998. Presently, 88 countries are invited to the International Chemistry Olympiads.

==Summary==



===Remote IChO===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, IChO 2020, 2021 and 2022 were organized remotely without a laboratory exam in order to keep the Olympic spirit of collaboration and peace even in harsh times.

<text>The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) was a space telescope for infrared light designed and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), in cooperation with ISAS (now part of JAXA) and NASA. The ISO was designed to study infrared light at wavelengths of 2.5 to 240 micrometres and operated from 1995 to 1998.

The €480.1-million satellite was launched on 17 November 1995 from the ELA-2 launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana. The launch vehicle, an Ariane 44P rocket, placed ISO successfully into a highly elliptical geocentric orbit, completing one revolution around the Earth every 24 hours. The primary mirror of its Ritchey-Chrétien telescope measured 60 cm in diameter and was cooled to 1.7 kelvins by means of superfluid helium. The ISO satellite contained four instruments that allowed for imaging and photometry from 2.5 to 240 micrometres and spectroscopy from 2.5 to 196.8 micrometers.

ESA and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center made efforts to improve the data pipelines and specialized software analysis tools to yield the best quality calibration and data reduction methods from the mission. IPAC supports ISO observers and data archive users through in-house visits and workshops.

== History and development ==

In 1983, the US-Dutch-British IRAS inaugurated space-based infrared astronomy by performing the first-ever &#x27;all-sky survey&#x27; at infrared wavelengths. The resulting map of the infrared sky pinpointed some 350,000 infrared sources waiting to be explored by IRAS&#x27; successors. In 1979, IRAS was in an advanced stage of planning and the expected results from IRAS led to the first proposal for ISO made to ESA in the same year. With the rapid improvements in infrared detector-technology, ISO was to provide detailed observations for some 30,000 infrared sources with much improved sensitivity and resolution. ISO was to perform 1000 times better in sensitivity and 100 times better in angular resolution at 12 micrometres compared to IRAS.

A number of follow-up studies resulted in the selection of ISO as the next installment for the ESA Scientific Programme in 1983. Next came a Call for Experiment and Mission Scientist Proposals to the scientific community, resulting in the selection of the scientific instruments in 1985. The four instruments chosen were developed by teams of researchers from France, Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.

Design and development of the satellite started in 1986 with Aérospatiale&#x27;s space division (currently absorbed into Thales Alenia Space) leading an international consortium of 32 companies responsible for manufacture, integration and testing of the new satellite. Final assembly took place at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center.

== The satellite ==

The basic design of ISO was strongly influenced by that of its immediate predecessor. Like IRAS, ISO was composed of two major components:
* Payload module, composed of a large cryostat holding the telescope and the four scientific instruments.
* Service module, supports the activities of the payload module by providing electrical power, thermal control, attitude and orbit control and telecommunications.

The payload module also held a conical sun shade, to prevent stray light from reaching the telescope, and two large star trackers. The latter were part of the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) which provided three-axis stabilisation of ISO with a pointing accuracy of one arc second. It consisted of Sun and Earth sensors, the before-mentioned star trackers, a quadrant star sensor on the telescope axis, gyroscopes and reaction wheels. A complementary reaction control system (RCS), using hydrazine propellant, was responsible for orbital direction and finetuning shortly after launch. The complete satellite weighed just under 2500 kg, was 5.3 m high, 3.6 m wide and measured 2.3 m in depth.

The service module held all the warm electronics, the hydrazine propellant tank and provided up to 600 watts of electrical power by means of solar cells mounted on the sunpointing side of the service module-mounted sunshield. The underside of the service module sported a load-bearing, ring shaped, physical interface for the launch vehicle.

The cryostat of the payload module surrounded the telescope and science instrument with a large dewar containing a toroidal tank loaded with 2268 litres of superfluid helium. Cooling by slow evaporation of the helium kept the temperature of the telescope below 3.4 K and the science instruments below 1.9 K. These very low temperatures were required for the scientific instruments to be sensitive enough to detect the small amount of infrared radiation from cosmic sources. Without this extreme cooling, the telescope and instruments would see only their own intense infrared emissions rather than the faint ones from afar.

== Optical telescope ==

The ISO telescope was mounted on the center line of the dewar, near the bottom-side of the toroidal helium tank. It was of the Ritchey-Chrétien type with an effective entrance pupil of 60 cm, a focal length ratio of 15 and a resulting focal length of 900 cm. Very strict control over straylight, particularly that from bright infrared sources outside the telescope&#x27;s field of view, was necessary to ensure the guaranteed sensitivity of the scientific instruments. A combination of light-tight shields, baffles inside the telescope and the sunshade on top of the cryostat accomplished full protection against straylight. Furthermore, ISO was constrained from observing too close to the Sun, Earth and Moon; all major sources of infrared radiation. ISO always pointed between 60 and 120 degrees away from the Sun and it never pointed closer than 77 degrees to Earth, 24 degrees to the Moon or closer than 7 degrees to Jupiter. These restrictions meant that at any given time only about 15 percent of the sky was available to ISO.

A pyramid-shaped mirror behind the primary mirror of the telescope distributed the infrared light to the four instruments, providing each of them with a 3 arc-minute section of the 20 arc-minute field of view of the telescope. Thus, pointing of a different instrument to the same cosmic object meant repointing the entire ISO satellite.

== Instruments ==

ISO carried an array of four scientific instruments for observations in the infrared:
* Infrared Camera (ISOCAM) – A high-resolution camera covering 2.5 to 17 micrometre wavelength with two different detectors. Like a visible-light camera it takes pictures of astronomical objects, but the image shows what the object looks like in infrared light.
* Photo-polarimeter (ISOPHOT) – An instrument designed to measure the polarisation of infrared radiation emitted from an astronomical object. The very broad wavelength range from 2.4 to 240 micrometre allowed this instrument to see the infrared emissions of even the coldest astronomical objects such as interstellar dust clouds
* Short Wave Spectrometer (SWS) – A spectrometer covering the 2.4 to 45 micrometre wavelength. Observations with this instrument provided valuable information about the chemical composition, density and temperature of the universe.
* Long Wave Spectrometer (LWS) – A spectrometer covering the 45 to 196.8 micrometre wavelength. 

All four instruments were mounted directly behind the primary mirror of the telescope, in a circular arrangement, with each instrument taking up an 80 degree segment of the cylindrical space. The field of view for each instrument was offset to the central axis of the telescope&#x27;s field of view. This means that every instrument &#x27;saw&#x27; a different portion of the sky at a given moment. In standard operational mode one instrument was in primary operation.

== Launch and operations ==

After a very successful development and integration phase ISO was finally launched into orbit on 17 November 1995, on board an Ariane-44P launch vehicle. Performance of the launch vehicle was very good with the apogee only 43 km lower than expected. ESA&#x27;s Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt in Germany had full control over ISO in the first four days of flight. After early commissioning primary control over ISO was handed over to the Spacecraft Control Centre (SCC) at Villanueva de la Cañada in Spain (VILSPA) for the remainder of the mission.
In the first three weeks after launch the orbit was fine-tuned and all satellite systems were activated and tested. Cool-down of the cryostat proved to be more efficient than previously calculated, so the anticipated mission length was extended to 24 months. Between 21 and 26 November all four science instruments were switched on and thoroughly checked out. Between 9 December 1995 and 3 February 1996 the &#x27;Performance Verification Phase&#x27; took place, dedicated to commissioning all instruments and fixing problems. Routine observations started from 4 February 1996, and lasted until the last helium coolant depleted on 8 April 1998.

The perigee of ISO&#x27;s orbit lay well inside the Van Allen radiation belt, forcing the science instruments to be shut down for seven hours during each pass through the radiation belt. Thus, 17 hours in each orbit remained for scientific observation. A typical 24-hour orbit of ISO can be broken down into six phases:
* Acquisition-of-Signal (AOS) by the primary Mission Control Center VILSPA in Spain and activation of the satellite.
* Science operations during the VILSPA window, starting four hours after perigee, and lasting for up to nine hours.
* Handover of operations to the secondary mission control center at Goldstone at apogee. During this 15 minute periode the science instruments could not be operated.
* Science operations during the Goldstone window, lasting up to eight hours.
* De-activation of the instruments upon approach of the Van Allen radiation belt and Loss-of-Signal (LOS) at Goldstone.
* Perigee passage.

Contrary to IRAS, no science data was recorded on-board ISO for later transmission to the ground. All data, both science data and housekeeping data were transmitted to the ground in real-time. The perigee point of ISO&#x27;s orbit was below the radio horizon of the mission control centers at both VILSPA and Goldstone, thus forcing the science instruments to be switched off at perigee.

== End of mission ==

At 07:00 UTC on 8 April 1998 flight controllers at VILSPA noticed a rise in temperature of the telescope. This was a clear sign that the load of superfluid helium coolant had depleted. At 23:07 UTC the same day, the temperature of the science instruments had risen above 4.2 K and science observations were ceased. A few detectors in the SWS instrument were capable of making observations at higher temperatures and remained in use for another 150 hours to make detailed measurements of an additional 300 stars. In the month following depletion of coolant the &#x27;Technology Test Phase&#x27; (TTP) was initiated to test several elements of the satellite in off-nominal conditions. After completion of TTP, the perigee of ISO&#x27;s orbit was lowered sufficiently enough to ensure ISO will burn up in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in 20 to 30 years after shutdown. ISO was then permanently switched off on 16 May 1998 at 12:00 UTC.

== Results ==

On average, ISO performed 45 observations in each 24-hour orbit. Throughout its lifetime of over 900 orbits ISO performed more than 26,000 successful scientific observations. The huge amounts of scientific data generated by ISO was subject to extensive archiving activities up to 2006. The full data-set has been available to the scientific community since 1998 and many discoveries have been made, with probably many more still to come:
* ISO detected the presence of water vapour in starforming regions, in the vicinity of stars at the end of their lives, in sources very close to the Galactic Centre, in the atmospheres of planets in the Solar System and in the Orion Nebula.
* Planet formation was detected around old, dying stars. This discovery contradicted theories that planet formation was only possible around young stars.
* Hydrogen fluoride gas was for the first time detected in interstellar gas clouds.
* The first detection of the earliest stages of stellar formation. The pre-stellar core L1689B was found and studied in great detail with ISO&#x27;s LWS instrument.
* ISO discovered large amounts of cosmic dust in the previously thought empty space between galaxies.
* Observations of the most-luminous object in the universe, Arp 220, revealed that the source for its enormous emission of infrared radiation is an outburst of star formation.
* Observations with the LWS instrument confirmed the previous discovery by IRAS of large cloud-like structures of very cold hydrocarbons radiating primarily in the infrared. These infrared cirrus clouds affect the energy balance of the entire universe, acting as a kind of galactic refrigerator.
* ISO searched for, and found several protoplanetary disks: rings or disks of material around stars which are considered to be the first stage of planet formation.
* ISO pointed its sensitive instruments on several of the planets in the Solar System to determine the chemical composition of their atmospheres.

<doc id="526220" wikidata="Q164873" url="?curid=526220" title="1000 Blank White Cards">
<text>1000 Blank White Cards is a party game played with cards in which the deck is created as part of the game. Though it has been played by adults in organized groups worldwide, 1000 Blank White Cards is also described as well-suited for children in &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Rules of Games&quot;. Since any game rules are contained on the cards (rather than existing as all-encompassing rules or in a book), 1000 Blank White Cards can be considered a sort of nomic. It can be played by any number of players and provides the opportunity for card creation and gameplay outside the scope of a single sitting. Creating new cards during the game, dealing with previous cards&#x27; effects, is allowed, and rule modification is encouraged as an integral part of gameplay.

==Game==
The game consists of whatever the players define it as by creating and playing things. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.

For many typical players, though, the game may be split into three logical parts: the deck creation, the play itself, and the epilogue.

===Deck creation===
A deck of cards consists of any number of cards, generally of a uniform size and of rigid enough paper stock that they may be reused. Some may bear artwork, writing or other game-relevant content created during past games, with a reasonable stock of cards that are blank at the start of gameplay. Some time may be taken to create cards before gameplay commences, although card creation may be more dynamic if no advance preparation is made, and it is suggested that the game be simply sprung upon a group of players, who may or may not have any idea what they are being caught up in. If the game has been played before, all past cards can be used in gameplay unless the game specifies otherwise, but perhaps not until the game has allowed them into play.

A typical group&#x27;s conventions for deck creation follow:
Though cards are created at all times throughout the game (except the epilogue), it is necessary to start with at least some cards pre-made. Despite the name of the game, a deck of 80 to 150 cards is usual, depending on the desired duration of the game, and of these approximately half will be created before the start of play. If a group doesn&#x27;t already possess a partial deck they may choose to start with fewer cards and to create most of the deck during play.

Whether or not the group possesses a deck already (from previous games), they will usually want to add a few more cards, so the first phase of the game involves each player creating six or seven new cards to add to the deck. See &quot;structure of a card&quot; below.

When the deck is ready, all of the cards (including blanks) are shuffled together and each player is dealt five cards. The remainder of the deck is placed in the centre of the table.

===Play===
The rules of game are determined as the game is played. There exists no fixed order of play or limit to the length or scope of the game. Such parameters may be set within the game but are of course subject to alteration.

One sample convention suggests the following:
Play proceeds clockwise beginning with the player on the dealer&#x27;s left. On each player&#x27;s turn, he/she draws a card from the central deck and then plays a card from his/her hand. Cards can be played to any player (including the person playing the card), or to the table (so that it affects everyone). Cards with lasting effects, such as awarding points or changing the game&#x27;s rules, are kept on the table to remind players of those effects. Cards with no lasting effects, or cards that have been nullified, are placed in a discard pile.

Blank cards can be made into playable cards at any time simply by drawing on them (see &quot;structure of a card&quot;).

Play continues until there are no cards left in the central deck and no one can play (if they have no cards that can be played in the current situation). The &quot;winner&quot; is the player with the highest score of total points at the end of the game, though in some games points don&#x27;t actually matter.

===Epilogue===
Since the cards created in any game may be used as the beginning of a deck for a future game, many players like to reduce the deck to a collection of their favourites. The epilogue is simply an opportunity for the players to collectively decide which cards to keep and which to discard (or set aside as not-for-play).

Many players believe that having their own cards favoured during the epilogue is the true &quot;victory&quot; of 1000 Blank White Cards, although the game&#x27;s creator has never discarded or destroyed a card unless that action was specified within the scope of the game. Retaining and replaying those cards which seem at the moment less than perfect can help reduce a certain stagnation and tendency to over-think that can otherwise overtake the game&#x27;s momentum.

One group of players in Boston (not the long-dispersed Harvard cadre) have introduced the idea of the &quot;Suck Box&quot;:

We don&#x27;t like to destroy cards, even if they suck, so we have a notecard box called The Suck Box. If a player feels a card is boring and useless to gameplay, they will nominate it for admission to The Suck Box. All players present then vote (sometimes lobbying for their cases), and the card either goes into The Suck Box or gets to remain in the primary deck. Ironically, when The Suck Box was introduced, one player created a card for the express purpose of adding it to The Suck Box. However, the rest of us felt that it was too amusing a card and had to remain in the deck.

==Structure of a card==
At its simplest, a card is just that: a physical card, which may or may not have undergone any modifications. Its role in the game is both as itself and as whatever information it carries, which can be changed, erased or amended. The cards used vary widely in size, from the original Vis-Ed brand flash cards, to half or full index cards, to simply sheets of A7 sized paper. Cards may be created with any marking medium and need not conform to any conventions of size or content unless specified within the scope of the game. Cards have been made of a wide range of substances, and modifying the shape or composition of a card is entirely acceptable: the original Vis-Ed box still contains a card, created by Plan 9 From Bell Labs developer Mycroftiv, to which a tablet of zinc has been affixed with adhesive tape; the card reads &quot;Eat This!... In a few minutes, the ZINC will be entering your system.&quot; Many cards have been created which demanded their own modification, destruction or duplication, and many have been created which display nothing but a picture or text bearing no explicit significance whatsoever. Some have been eaten, burned, or cut and folded into other shapes.

The game does tend to fall into structural conventions, of which the following is a good example:
A card consists (usually) of a title, a picture and a description of its effect. The title should uniquely identify the card. The picture can be as simple as a stick figure, or as complex as the player likes. The description, or rule, is the part that affects the game. It can award or deny points, cause a player to miss a turn, change the direction of play, or do anything the player can think of. The rules written on cards in play make up the majority of the game&#x27;s total ruleset.

In practice, these conventions can generate rather monotonous decks of one panel cartoons bearing point values, rules or both. As conceived, the game is far broader, as it is not inherently limited in length or scope, is radically self-modifying, and can contain references to, or actual instances of, other games or activities. The game can also encode algorithms (trivially functioning as a Turing machine), store real-world data, and hold or refer to non-card objects.

==History==
The game was originally created late in 1995 by Nathan McQuillen of Madison, Wisconsin. He was inspired by seeing a product at a local coffeehouse: a box of 1000 Vis-Ed brand blank white flash cards. He introduced &quot;The game of 1000 blank white cards&quot; a few days later into a mixed group including students, improvisational theatre members and club kids. Initial play sessions were frequent and high energy, but a fire consumed the regular venue shortly after the game&#x27;s introduction. The game physically survived but with the loss of their regular meeting place the majority of the original players fell out of contact with one another, and soon most had moved on to other cities.

The game started to spread as a meme through various social networks, mostly collegiate, in the late 1990s. Aaron Mandel, a former Madison resident, brought the game to Harvard University and started an active playgroup which changed the size of the cards to the more standard half-index dimensions (). Boston players Dave Packer and Stewart King created the first web content representing the game. Their graduation served to further spread the game to the west coast and onto the web. Subsequently, an article in &quot;GAMES&quot; Magazine and inclusion in the 2001 revision of &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Rules of Games&quot; established the game as an independent part of gaming culture. Various celebrities have also contributed cards to the game, including musicians Ben Folds and Jonatha Brooke, and cartoonist Bill Plympton.

The game&#x27;s inventor and its original players have frequently expressed amusement at the spread of a game they regarded mostly as a brilliant but highly idiosyncratic bit of conceptual humor which provided them with an excuse to draw goofy cartoons.

<text>The imperial woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis) is a woodpecker species endemic to Mexico. If it is not extinct, it is the world&#x27;s largest woodpecker species, at long. Owing to its close taxonomic relationship, and its similarity in appearance, to the ivory-billed woodpecker (&quot;C. principalis&quot;), it is sometimes called the Mexican ivory-billed woodpecker, but this name is also used for the extant pale-billed woodpecker (&quot;C. guatemalensis&quot;). The large and conspicuous bird has long been known to the native inhabitants of Mexico and was called in Nahuatl, by the Tepehuán and by the Tarahumara.

There have been no confirmed sightings of the imperial woodpecker since 1956. It is generally believed to be extinct, although the survival of some individuals is considered a remote possibility.

==Description and ecology==

The imperial woodpecker&#x27;s typical size ranges from . The male imperial woodpecker has a red-sided crest, centered black, but otherwise mostly black, with large white wing-patches, thin white &quot;braces&quot; on its mantle and a huge ivory-colored bill. They are all black except for the inner primaries, which are white-tipped, the white secondaries and a white scapular stripe which, unlike the ivory-billed woodpecker, does not extend onto the neck. The female is similar, but her crest is all black and (unlike the female ivory-bill) recurved at the top, lacking any red. Much larger than any other sympatric woodpecker, it is the only woodpecker in the area with solid black underparts. Its voice is reportedly toy trumpet-like. The bird was once widespread and, until the early 1950s, not uncommon throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico, from western Sonora and Chihuahua southwards to Jalisco and Michoacán. It is likely that, in the past, the woodpecker&#x27;s range followed the Sierra Madre north into Arizona, but by the time it was scientifically described in the 19th century, it was already confined to Mexico. It has been suggested that it might occur in Arizona, and there is also a hypothetical record of it in 1958 in Big Bend National Park, Texas, however this is not mentioned in Oberholser&#x27;s two-volume &quot;The Bird Life of Texas.&quot;

The imperial woodpecker prefers open montane forests made up of pine – oak forest dominated by large pines and with numerous dead trees, usually between above sea level. Most records are from elevations of , but there are records as low as . Large-growing pines native in the Sierra Madre Occidental include Durango, Chihuahua white, Apache and Arizona pines. It feeds mainly on the insect larvae found underneath bark scaled from dead pine trees. There are many reports of more than four individuals, and this grouping behaviour may be related to its foraging specialisation. Breeding has been recorded between February and June, and probably one to four eggs are laid. A mated pair requires a very large area of untouched mature forest to survive, approximately ; outside the breeding season, the birds are reported to form small groups of up to 12 individuals and move about a wide area, apparently in response to the availability of food. The main food source, beetle larvae in snags, is probably distributed in patches and peaks within a short period of time. Consequently, feeding sites are probably best exploited by &quot;nomadic&quot; groups. If operating in groups of seven or eight individuals, the minimum area of old-growth forest for a group is .

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has released a film of the imperial woodpecker recorded in Mexico in 1956.

==Decline and possible extinction==

The imperial woodpecker is officially listed as &quot;critically endangered (possibly extinct)&quot; by the IUCN and BirdLife International. It was not historically a rare species within a suitable habitat, but the total population probably never numbered more than 8,000 individuals (Lammertink et al. 1996). Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals) based on the lack of confirmed records since 1956; analyses of remaining habitats indicate that no tracts remain which are large enough to support the species. The last confirmed record was from Durango in 1956 and the species is very likely now extinct. If they have gone extinct, it would have been due to habitat destruction and fragmentation combined with hunting. These factors are the reason why the species has not been seen in over 60 years, although there have been local reports of sightings. Researchers believe that their decline was also accelerated by active eradication campaigns conducted by logging interests and by over-hunting — for use in folk medicine and because nestlings were considered a delicacy by the Tarahumara. It has been hunted for sport, food and for medicinal purposes over a long period of time and feathers and bills were reportedly used in rituals by the Tepheuana and Huichol tribes in the south of Durango. Additionally, imperial woodpeckers are stunning birds and, as the species became increasingly rare, many were apparently shot by people who had never encountered such a bird and wanted to get a closer look. 
The habitat in which the imperial woodpecker was located was predominantly in coniferous forests (terrain levels at 2,700-2,900 m. elevation). The area in which they lived was abundant with large dead trees, the removal of which could be linked to their extinction. The area had been cleared and logged multiple times by 2010. Increasing effort in conservation biology is being devoted to the analysis of the extinction risk as well as the search for the rare, long unseen, species. There are a handful of more recent, unconfirmed sightings, the most recent of which closely followed the 2005 publication of the purported rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker. Lammertink &quot;et al.&quot; (1996), after extensively reviewing post-1956 reports, conclude that the species did indeed survive into the 1990s in the central part of its range, but also consider its continued survival very unlikely. According to them, the population was always restricted in historic times, although the species was indeed present in maximum density before a catastrophic decline during the 1950s. The lack of good records from that time is apparently based more on lack of research than on actual rarity, but this seems to have changed radically only one decade later.

Field research by Tim Gallagher and Martjan Lammertink, reported in Gallagher&#x27;s 2013 book, found evidence — in the form of accounts by elderly residents in the bird&#x27;s range who saw imperial woodpeckers decades earlier and who discussed their recollections with the researchers — that foresters working with Mexican logging companies in the 1950s told the local people that the woodpeckers were destroying valuable timber and encouraged the people to kill the birds. As part of this campaign, the foresters gave the local residents poison to smear on trees that the birds foraged on. Because groups of imperial woodpeckers tended to feed on a single huge, dead, old-growth pine tree for as long as two weeks, applying poison to such a tree would be an effective way to wipe out a group of up to one dozen of these huge woodpeckers — and, perhaps, even to kill off succeeding groups of the birds that might move into the area and be attracted to the same tree. Gallagher suspects that such a campaign of poisoning may be the key to the species&#x27; apparent catastrophic population crash in the 1950s, which has hitherto lacked a satisfactory explanation. A campaign of poisoning could well have killed whole groups of the bird in a short time. The premise of protecting valuable timber from the woodpeckers was, in fact, baseless. Imperial woodpeckers do not forage on or excavate nest or roosting holes in live, healthy trees.

In Gallagher&#x27;s nonfiction account &quot;Imperial Dreams&quot; (2013), he discusses how difficult the search is for the imperial woodpecker due to its dangerous location. In Mexico&#x27;s Sierra Madre Occidental, there are major marijuana and opium poppy-growing regions that are patrolled by armed guards. The drug cartels often kill anyone who comes too close to their crops.

A search of the multi-institution online specimen database VertNet reveals that only 144 physical specimens of the imperial woodpecker exist, including only three known complete skeletons. An overlooked woodpecker skeleton from the Natural History Museum at Tring appears to also belong to the species. The species is also known from a single amateur film from 1956 depicting one bird climbing, foraging and flying. The film has been restored and released by Cornell University. Gallagher&#x27;s inspiration to search for the imperial woodpecker was this 1956 film, taken by dentist William Rhein, who made several trips to Mexico in search of the imperial woodpecker. This is the only known photographic record of the species.

The imperial woodpecker has been considered to be extinct by the Government of Mexico since 2001. However, its rediscovery or reintroduction would prompt immediate protection under the law.

<doc id="526222" wikidata="Q1378173" url="?curid=526222" title="European Patent Convention">
<text>The European Patent Convention (EPC), also known as the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, is a multilateral treaty instituting the European Patent Organisation and providing an autonomous legal system according to which European patents are granted. The term &quot;European patent&quot; is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally enforceable, nationally revocable patents, subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.

The EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents, via a single, harmonised procedure before the European Patent Office (EPO). A single patent application, in one language, may be filed at the EPO in Munich, at its branch in The Hague, at its sub-office in Berlin, or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.

== History ==
In September 1949, French Senator Henri Longchambon proposed to the Council of Europe the creation of a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the &quot;Longchambon plan&quot;, marked the beginning of the work on a European patent law aimed at a &quot;European patent&quot;. His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council&#x27;s Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the formalities required for patent applications (1953) and one on the international classification of patent (1954). The Council&#x27;s Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the Strasbourg Patent Convention in 1963.

In 1973, the &quot;Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents&quot; took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the &quot;Munich Convention&quot;). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which Kurt Haertel, considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and François Savignon played a decisive role.

The Convention was officially signed by 16 countries on 5 October 1973.

The Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: Belgium, Germany (then West Germany), France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for Sweden. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the Administrative Council which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977). Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.

The EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Monaco, Iceland, Norway, North Macedonia, San Marino, Albania, Serbia, the United Kingdom, and Montenegro are party to the EPC but are not members of the EU. Further, the EU is not a party to the EPC, although all members of the EU are party to the EPC. The Convention is, as of October 2022, in force in 39 countries. Montenegro became the 39th Contracting State on 1 October 2022.

A diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in international law and to add a level of judicial review of the Boards of Appeal decisions. The revised text, informally called the EPC 2000, entered into force on 13 December 2007.

===Cooperation agreements with non-contracting states: extension and validation agreements===

Throughout the history of the EPC, some non-contracting States have concluded cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became &quot;extension states&quot; or &quot;validation states&quot;, which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to , are not based on a &quot;direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC&quot;, and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states. As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is &quot;not subject to the jurisdiction of the [EPO] boards of appeal.&quot;

As of October 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina has an extension agreement with the EPO so that, in effect, this state can be designated in a European patent application. Several other &quot;extension states&quot; have since become states parties to the EPC. Furthermore, so-called &quot;validation agreements&quot; with Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia are also in effect since 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively. A further validation agreement was signed with Georgia on 31 October 2019 and entered into force on 15 January 2024.

== Legal nature and content ==

The European Patent Convention is &quot;a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last revised on 14 July 1967, and a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45, paragraph 1, of the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 19 June 1970.&quot; The European Patent Convention currently does not lead to the grant of centrally enforceable patents in all 39 countries, although the European Union patent would allow for unitary effect: centrally enforceability throughout 24 of the 27 countries of the European Union.

The content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles. These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention, are:
* the &quot;Implementing Regulations to the Convention on the Grant of European patents&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Implementing Regulations&quot;. The function of the Implementing Regulations is &quot;to determine in more detail how the Articles should be applied&quot;. In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the Implementing Regulations, the provisions of the EPC prevail.
* the &quot;Protocol on Jurisdiction and the recognition of decisions in respect of the right to the grant of a European patent&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Protocol on Recognition&quot;. This protocol deals with the right to the grant of a European patent but exclusively applies to European patent applications.
* the &quot;Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Patent Organisation&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Protocol on Privileges and Immunities&quot;;
* the &quot;Protocol on the Centralisation of the European Patent System and on its Introduction&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Protocol on Centralisation&quot;;
* the &quot;Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the Convention&quot;;
* the &quot;Protocol on the Staff Complement of the European Patent Office at The Hague&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Protocol on Staff Complement&quot;.

== Substantive patent law ==
One of the most important articles of the Convention, , entitled &quot;Patentable inventions&quot;, states:
This article constitutes the &quot;fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;T 154/04-r6&quot;&gt;Decision T 154/04 of 15 November 2006, Reasons 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EPC provides further indications on what is and is not patentable. Specifically, the EPC sets forth exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.

First, discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers and presentations of information are not regarded as inventions and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas &quot;as such&quot;. This is &quot;a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC.&quot; &quot;(For further information, see also: Software patents under the EPC).&quot;

The second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include:
* Inventions contrary to &quot;ordre public&quot; or morality (Article 53(a) EPC),
* Plant or animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals (Article 53(b) EPC), and
* Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body (Article 53(c) EPC), which have been excluded for &quot;socio-ethical considerations and considerations of public health&quot;. Products, &quot;in particular substances or compositions&quot;, for use in any of these therapeutic or diagnostic methods are not excluded from patentability, however.

== Unified prosecution phase ==

The Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.

European patent applications may be filed in any language, but they are prosecuted only in one of the three official languages of the EPO – English, French and German. If an application is filed in another language than an official language, a translation must be filed into one of the three official languages, within two months from the date of filing. The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the &quot;language of proceedings&quot; and is used by the EPO for communications.

European patent applications are prosecuted in a similar fashion to most patent systems – the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.

During the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and &quot;the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States.&quot; All Contracting States are considered designated upon filing of a European patent application. and the designations need to be &quot;confirmed&quot; later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees. Once granted by the EPO, a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.

==Opposition==

There are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the limitation and revocation procedures. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.

== Grant, effect and need for translations ==
In contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure. In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.

A European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the European Patent Bulletin. That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification. This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).

A translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have &quot;prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language&quot;. The European patent is &quot;void ab initio&quot; in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant. In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the London Agreement is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived. If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.

== Enforcement and validity ==

Almost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions.

===Infringement===
Infringement is remitted entirely to national law and to national courts. In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the &quot;direct product of a patented process&quot; to be an infringement. The &quot;extent of the protection&quot; conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and drawings, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims. A &quot;Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC&quot; provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a &quot;fair&quot; middle position, neither &quot;strict, literal&quot; nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation. The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.

All other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for wilful infringement, etc.), equitable defences, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.

For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the European Court of Justice. In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the Brussels Convention, the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was &quot;unavoidable&quot; that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.

===Validity===
Validity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts. limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:

* if the subject-matter of the European patent is not patentable within the terms of Articles 52 to 57 EPC (see &quot;Substantive patent law&quot; section above);
* if the disclosure does not permit the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art;
* if amendments have been made such that the subject-matter extends beyond the content of the application as filed;
* if the claims have been broadened post-grant, e.g. in opposition proceedings;
* an improper proprietor—in some jurisdictions, only the person pretending to be entitled to the European patent can raise this specific ground, so that the resulting nullity of the patent may be relative to some persons only.

== Term (duration) of a European patent ==
The EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a term of 20 years from the filing date, the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the PCT designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the priority date, which can be up to one year earlier. The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval. For EEA member states this is by means of a supplementary protection certificate (SPC).

== Relation with the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==
A European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), i.e. the filing of a PCT application, and then the entry into &quot;European regional phase&quot;, i.e. the transition from the international to the European procedural stages. The European patent application is therefore said to be a &quot;Euro-PCT application&quot; and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office. In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the PCT, the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations prevail over those of the EPC.

Twelve EPC Contracting States, namely Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, San Marino, and Slovenia, have &quot;closed their national route&quot;. This means that, for these countries, it is not possible to obtain a national patent through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent. The &quot;national route&quot; for Italy was closed until 30 June 2020, but Italy then reopened it for PCT applications filed on or after 1 July 2020.

<doc id="526224" wikidata="Q844163" url="?curid=526224" title="Indo-Australian plate">
<text>The Indo-Australian plate is or was a major tectonic plate. It is in the process of separation into two or three plates, and may be currently separated into more than one plate. It contains the continent of Australia, its surrounding ocean and extends north-west to include the Indian subcontinent and the adjacent waters.

==Formation==
It was formed by the fusion of the then Indian and the then Australian plates approximately 43 million years ago. The fusion happened when the mid-ocean ridge in the Indian Ocean, which separated the two plates, ceased spreading.

==Regions==
Australia-New Guinea (Mainland Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania), the Indian subcontinent, and Zealandia (New Caledonia, New Zealand, and Norfolk Island) are all fragments of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. As the ocean floor broke apart, these land masses fragmented from one another, and for a time these centers were thought to be dormant and fused into a single plate. However, research in the early 21st century indicates plate separation of the Indo-Australian plate may have already occurred.

==Characteristics==
The eastern side of the plate is the convergent boundary with the Pacific plate. The Pacific plate sinks below the Australian plate and forms the Kermadec Trench and the island arcs of Tonga and Kermadec. New Zealand is situated along the southeastern boundary of the plate, which with New Caledonia makes up the southern and northern ends of the ancient landmass of Zealandia, which separated from Australia 85 million years ago. The central part of Zealandia sank under the sea.

The southern margin of the plate forms a divergent boundary with the Antarctic plate. The western side is subdivided by the Indian plate that borders the Arabian plate to the north and the African plate to the south. The northern margin of the Indian plate forms a convergent boundary with the Eurasian plate, which constitutes the active orogenic process of the Himalayas and the Hindukush mountains.

The northeast side of the Australian plate forms a subduction boundary with the Eurasian plate in the Indian Ocean between the borders of Bangladesh and Burma and to the southwest of the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Along the northern Ninety East Ridge under the Indian Ocean there appears to be a weakness zone where the Indian and Australian plates are going different ways. The subsidence boundary through Indonesia is reflected in the Wallace line.

==Plate movements==

The eastern part (Australian plate) is moving northward at the rate of per year while the western part (Indian plate) is moving only at the rate of per year due to the impediment of the Himalayas. In terms of the middle of India and Australia&#x27;s landmasses, Australia is moving northward at per year relative to India. This differential movement has resulted in the compression of the former plate near its centre at Sumatra and the division into the separate Indian and Australian plates again.

A third plate, known as the Capricorn plate, may also be separating off the western side of the Indian plate as part of the continued breakup of the Indo-Australian plate.

===Separation===
There is good evidence that the Indo-Australian plate is in the process of separation into new plates. Recent studies, and evidence from seismic events such as the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes, suggest that the Indo-Australian plate may have already broken up into two or three separate plates due primarily to stresses induced by the collision of the Indo-Australian plate with Eurasia along what later became the Himalayas, and that the Indian plate and Australian plate may have been separate since at least .

Contemporary models suggest at present there is a deformation zone between the Indian and Australian plates, with both earthquake and global satellite navigation system data indicating that India and Australia are not moving on the same vectors northward. In due course, some expect a well defined localized boundary to reform between the Indian and Australian plates. Studies show the Ninetyeast Ridge has active faulting along its whole length so that while the simplest explanation is that the Indian and Australian plates have already separated here, it remains possible that only the Capricorn plate has separated from them.

<doc id="526225" wikidata="Q15030874" url="?curid=526225" title="Brixton Market">
<text>Brixton Market comprises a street market in the centre of Brixton, south London, and the adjacent covered market areas in nearby arcades Reliance Arcade, Market Row and Granville Arcade (rebranded as &#x27;Brixton Village&#x27; in 2009).

The market sells a wide range of foods and goods but is best known for its African and Caribbean produce, which reflect the diverse community of Brixton and surrounding areas of Lambeth. The Street Market is managed by the London Borough of Lambeth. The covered arcades have always been in private ownership, although substantial public funding was provided for their refurbishment under the Brixton Challenge grant scheme.

The market was severely damaged by fire on 16 July 2022.

==History==

The Market began on Atlantic Road in the 1870s and subsequently spread to Brixton Road which had a very wide footway. Brixton then was a rapidly expanding London railway suburb with newly opening shops, including the first London branch of David Greig at 54-58 Atlantic Road in 1870, and London&#x27;s first purpose-built department store, Bon Marché, on Brixton Road in 1877. The market was a popular attraction, with shoppers being entertained by street musicians.

Electric Avenue which is now part of the street market was built in the 1880s and was one of the first streets to have electric light. Glazed iron canopies covered the footpath, but these were significantly damaged by WW2 bombs, and finally removed in the 1980s. The song &quot;Electric Avenue&quot; was written by Eddy Grant referring to this area of the market. In 2016, Electric Avenue was refurbished with funding from the Mayor of London&#x27;s High Street Fund, Lambeth Council, Transport for London and the Heritage Lottery fund to include an illuminated sign celebrating the area&#x27;s history.

==The covered market arcades==
The market arcades were built in the 1920s and 1930s when road widening on Brixton Road forced traders from their established pitches.

Reliance Arcade, 455 Brixton Road (c1924) provides a narrow pedestrian route from Brixton Road to Electric Lane. It incorporates the original Georgian house and has a beautiful Egyptian tomb facade to Electric Lane; it was extended forward by Ernest J Thomas in 1931. Inside there are small shops no larger than market stalls and a glazed roof provide the light.

Reliance Arcade is Grade II listed, and was added to English Heritage&#x27;s Heritage At Risk Register in October 2014.

Market Row, 40–44 Atlantic Road was designed by Andrews and Peascod in 1928. It was built in the back yards of existing premises and links Atlantic Road, Coldharbour Lane and Electric Lane. The interior is double-height and windows in the roof provide light.

Brixton Village, Coldharbour Lane was built as Granville Arcade in 1937 to designs of Alfred and Vincent Burr; the developer was Philip Granville-Grossman. It was opened by actor Carl Brisson on 6 May 1937. It has an interior of narrow covered streets called &#x27;Avenues&#x27;, and is double-height, similar to Market Row. There are over 100 shops. It links Coldharbour Lane, Atlantic Road and Popes Road.

The three market arcades in close proximity, forming an extensive network of stalls, are rare survivals and their special character is what marks out Brixton as distinctive from other suburban shopping centres: a mixture of history, interesting architecture, the variety of goods on sale and the cultural mix of Brixton, known as the symbolic &#x27;soul of black Britain&#x27;.

Since 2011, the shops in Brixton Village and, more recently, Market Row and Reliance Arcade have been increasingly converted into cafes and restaurants, serving a wide range of different cuisines. As a result, they are now open 8:00 am – 11.30 pm every day except Monday, when they shut at 6:00 pm.

===Proposed redevelopment of covered market arcades (2008–2009)===
In 2007, Market Row and Brixton Village were sold along with the other London market interests of APL Ocean Ltd to London &amp; Associated Properties. In 2008, the new owners released proposals to redevelop the Brixton Village covered market.

The proposal included the removal of the existing building and the building of a 10-storey privately owned residential tower block and private park, above a new market building.

In January 2009, London and Associated Properties employed communications company Four Communications to undertake a survey of local opinion. Concerns were raised on the Brixton Community website Urban 75 that the survey was one sided, only available in English.

Friends of Brixton Market, traders and residents ran a successful campaign against the proposals.

Paul Bakalite&#x27;s proposal for Listing was strongly supported by the Twentieth Century Society. In April 2010 the Secretary of State of the Department of Culture (DCMS) announced that the government had overturned its previous decision not award heritage protection to these three arcades and declared all three Grade II listed buildings. They were listed by virtue of their cultural importance and contribution to the social and economic history of Brixton, particularly since the 1950s as one of the principal hearts of the Afro-Caribbean community in London, as well as for their architectural importance since such arcades, once more common, are now rare.

=== Controversial redevelopment plans for Brixton Arches (2016–2017) ===

In 2015, Network Rail contacted the merchants trading from the commercial premises located under the railway arches on Atlantic Road indicating plans to close those premises for a year for refurbishment as part of the Brixton Central masterplan for redevelopment of the area. This led to a public outcry from traders, many of whom had been occupying their retail space for decades, claiming that this closure was an excuse to increase rents as they would be able to return to occupy the same space, but with a 350% increase of their rents. 

The traders and community launched the Save Brixton Arches campaign, which fed into the anti-gentrification movement already underway within the Brixton community and culminated in a protest at the local council meeting where community activists declared the &quot;death of Brixton&quot; after the plans were approved. In 2017, the majority of the arches traders ceased trading and hoardings were installed over the empty premises, but development has stalled due to complications involving the leases of two of the tenants. 

During the same decade a series of properties comprosing most of Brixton Market were purchased by Hondo a company controlled by Taylor McWilliams an American investor. McWilliams has since proposed building an office tower twenty stories tall on Electric Avenue.

<doc id="526227" wikidata="Q580043" url="?curid=526227" title="Uhuru (satellite)">
<text>Uhuru was the first satellite launched specifically for the purpose of X-ray astronomy. It was also known as the X-ray Explorer Satellite, SAS-A (for Small Astronomy Satellite A, the first of the three-spacecraft SAS series), SAS 1, or Explorer 42. The NASA observatory was launched on 12 December 1970 into an initial orbit of about 560 km apogee, 520 km perigee, 3 degrees inclination, with a period of 96 minutes. The mission ended in March 1973. Uhuru was a scanning mission, with a spin period of ~12 minutes. It performed the first comprehensive survey of the entire sky for X-ray sources, with a sensitivity of about 0.001 times the intensity of the Crab nebula.

==Objectives==
The main objectives of the mission were:
* To survey the sky for cosmic X-ray sources in the 2–20 keV range to a limiting sensitivity of 1.5 × 10−18 joule/(cm2-sec), 5 × 10−4 the flux from the Crab Nebula
* To determine discrete source locations with a precision of a few square minutes of arc for strong sources and a few tenths of a square degree at the sensitivity limit
* To study the structure of extended sources or complex regions with a resolution of about 30 arc minutes
* To determine gross spectral features and variability of X-ray sources
* To perform, wherever possible, coordinated and/or simultaneous observations of X-ray objects with other observers.

==Instrumentation==
The payload consisted of two sets of proportional counters, each with ~0.084 m2 effective area. 
The counters were sensitive with more than 10% efficiency to X-ray photons in the ~2–20 keV range. 
The lower energy limit was determined by the attenuation of the beryllium windows of the counter plus a thin thermal shroud that was needed to maintain temperature stability of the spacecraft.
The upper energy limit was determined by the transmission properties of the counter filling gas. 
Pulse-shape discrimination and anticoincidence techniques were used to filter out emissions of particles and undesirable high-energy photons in the background. 
Pulse-height analysis in eight energy channels was used to obtain information on the energy spectrum of the incident photons. 
The two sets of counters were placed back to back and were collimated to 0.52° × 0.52° and 5.2° × 5.2° (full width at half maximum) respectively. 
While the 0.52° detector gave finer angular resolution, the 5.2° detector had higher sensitivity for isolated sources.

==Results==

Uhuru achieved several outstanding scientific advances, including the discovery and detailed study of the pulsing accretion-powered binary X-Ray sources such as Cen X-3, Vela X-1, and Her X-1, the identification of Cygnus X-1, the first strong candidate for an astrophysical black hole, and many important extragalactic sources.
The Uhuru Catalog, issued in four successive versions, the last being the 4U catalog, was the first comprehensive X-ray catalog, contains 339 objects and covers the whole sky in the 2–6 keV band.
The final version of the source catalog is known as the 4U Catalog; earlier versions were the 2U and 3U catalogs. Sources are referenced as, e.g., &quot;4U 1700-37&quot;.

==Naming==
The satellite&#x27;s name, &quot;Uhuru&quot;, is the Swahili word for &quot;freedom&quot;. It was named in recognition of the hospitality of Kenya from where it was launched, using the Italian San Marco launch platform near Mombasa.

<text>In Christian angelology, thrones (, pl. θρόνοι; , pl. &quot;throni&quot;) are a class of angels. This is based on an interpretation of . According to 1 Peter 3:21–22, Christ had gone to Heaven and &quot;angels and authorities and powers&quot; had been made subject to him.

Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in his work De Coelesti Hierarchia includes the thrones as the third highest of nine levels of angels.

According to the Second Book of Enoch, thrones are seen by Enoch in the Seventh Heaven.

==Christian angelology==
According to Matthew Bunson, the corresponding order of angels in Judaism is called the &quot;abalim&quot; or &quot;erelim&quot;, but this opinion is far from universal. The Hebrew word &quot;erelim&quot; is usually not translated &quot;thrones&quot;, but rather &quot;valiant ones&quot;, &quot;heroes&quot;, or &quot;warriors&quot;. The function ascribed to &quot;erelim&quot; in and in Jewish folklore is not consistent with the lore surrounding the thrones.

Thrones are sometimes equated with ophanim since the throne of God is usually depicted as being moved by wheels, as in the vision of (Old Testament). Rosemary Ellen Guiley (1996: p. 37) states that:

<doc id="526237" wikidata="Q164160" url="?curid=526237" title="Twilight">
<text>Twilight is daylight illumination produced by diffuse sky radiation when the Sun is below the horizon as sunlight from the upper atmosphere is scattered in a way that illuminates both the Earth&#x27;s lower atmosphere and also the Earth&#x27;s surface. Twilight also may be any period when this illumination occurs.

The lower the Sun is beneath the horizon, the dimmer the sky (other factors such as atmospheric conditions being equal). When the Sun reaches 18° below the horizon, the illumination emanating from the sky is nearly zero, and evening twilight becomes nighttime. When the Sun approaches re-emergence, reaching 18° below the horizon, nighttime becomes morning twilight. Owing to its distinctive quality, primarily the absence of shadows and the appearance of objects silhouetted against the lit sky, twilight has long been popular with photographers and painters, who often refer to it as the blue hour, after the French expression .

By analogy with evening twilight, sometimes &quot;twilight&quot; is used metaphorically to imply that something is losing strength and approaching its end. For example, very old people may be said to be &quot;in the twilight of their lives&quot;. The collateral adjective for &quot;twilight&quot; is &quot;crepuscular&quot;, which may be used to describe the behavior of animals that are most active during this period.
==Definitions by geometry==
Twilight occurs according to the solar elevation angle &quot;θs&quot;, which is the position of the geometric center of the Sun relative to the horizon. There are three established and widely accepted &quot;subcategories&quot; of twilight: civil twilight (nearest the horizon), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight (farthest from the horizon).

== Civil twilight ==
Civil twilight is the period of time for which the geometric center of the Sun is between the horizon and 6° below the horizon. 

Civil twilight is the period when enough natural light remains so that artificial light in towns and cities is not needed. In the United States&#x27; military, the initialisms BMCT (&quot;begin morning civil twilight&quot;, i.e., civil dawn) and EECT (&quot;end evening civil twilight&quot;, i.e., civil dusk) are used to refer to the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight, respectively. Civil dawn is preceded by morning nautical twilight and civil dusk is followed by evening nautical twilight.

Under clear weather conditions, civil twilight approximates the limit at which solar illumination suffices for the human eye to clearly distinguish terrestrial objects. Enough illumination renders artificial sources unnecessary for most outdoor activities. At civil dawn and at civil dusk, sunlight clearly defines the horizon while the brightest stars and planets can appear. As observed from the Earth (see apparent magnitude), sky-gazers know Venus, the brightest planet, as the &quot;morning star&quot; or &quot;evening star&quot; because they can see it during civil twilight.

Although civil dawn marks the time of the first appearance of civil twilight before sunrise, and civil dusk marks the time of the first disappearance of civil twilight after sunset, civil twilight statutes typically denote a fixed period after sunset or before sunrise (most commonly 20–30 minutes) rather than how many degrees the Sun is below the horizon. Examples include when drivers of automobiles must turn on their headlights (called lighting-up time in the UK), when hunting is restricted, or when the crime of burglary is to be treated as nighttime burglary, which carries stiffer penalties in some jurisdictions.

The period may affect when extra equipment, such as anti-collision lights, is required for aircraft to operate. In the US, civil twilight for aviation is defined in Part 1.1 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) as the time listed in the American Air Almanac.

== Nautical twilight ==
Nautical twilight occurs when the geometric center of the Sun is between 12° and 6° below the horizon.

After nautical dusk and before nautical dawn, sailors cannot navigate via the horizon at sea as they cannot clearly see the horizon. At nautical dawn and nautical dusk, the human eye finds it difficult, if not impossible, to discern traces of illumination near the sunset or sunrise point of the horizon (&quot;first light&quot; after nautical dawn but before civil dawn and &quot;nightfall&quot; after civil dusk but before nautical dusk).

 Sailors can take reliable star sightings of well-known stars, during the stage of nautical twilight when they can distinguish a visible horizon for reference (i.e. after astronomic dawn or before astronomic dusk). 
Under good atmospheric conditions with the absence of other illumination, during nautical twilight, the human eye may distinguish general outlines of ground objects but cannot participate in detailed outdoor operations.

Nautical twilight has military considerations as well. The initialisms BMNT (begin morning nautical twilight, &quot;i.e.&quot; nautical dawn) and EENT (end evening nautical twilight, &quot;i.e.&quot; nautical dusk) are used and considered when planning military operations. A military unit may treat BMNT and EENT with heightened security, e.g. by &quot;standing to&quot;, for which everyone assumes a defensive position.

==Astronomical twilight==

Astronomical twilight is defined as when the geometric center of the Sun is between 18° and 12° below the horizon. During astronomical twilight, the sky is dark enough to permit astronomical observation of point sources of light such as stars, except in regions with more intense skyglow due to light pollution, moonlight, auroras, and other sources of light. Some critical observations, such as of faint diffuse items such as nebulae and galaxies, may require observation beyond the limit of astronomical twilight. Theoretically, the faintest stars detectable by the naked eye (those of approximately the sixth magnitude) will become visible in the evening at astronomical dusk, and become invisible at astronomical dawn.

==Times of occurrence==
===Between day and night===
Observers within about 48°34&#x27; of the Equator can view twilight twice each day on every date of the year between astronomical dawn, nautical dawn, or civil dawn, and sunrise as well as between sunset and civil dusk, nautical dusk, or astronomical dusk. This also occurs for most observers at higher latitudes on many dates throughout the year, except those around the summer solstice. However, at latitudes closer than 8°35&#x27; (between 81°25’ and 90°) to either Pole, the Sun cannot rise above the horizon nor sink more than 18° below it on the same day on any date, so this example of twilight cannot occur because the angular difference between solar noon and solar midnight is less than 17°10’.

Observers within 63°26&#x27; of the Equator can view twilight twice each day on every date between the month of the autumnal equinox and the month of vernal equinox between astronomical dawn, nautical dawn, or civil dawn, and sunrise as well as between sunset and civil dusk, nautical dusk, or astronomical dusk, i.e., from September 1 to March 31 of the following year in the Northern Hemisphere and from March 1 to September 30 in the Southern Hemisphere.

The nighttime/twilight boundary solar midnight&#x27;s latitude varies depending on the month:

* In January or July, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 48°50&#x27; North or South, because then the Sun&#x27;s declination is less than 23°10&#x27; from the Equator;

* In February or August, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 53°47&#x27; North or South, because then the Sun&#x27;s declination is less than 18°13&#x27; from the Equator;

* In March or September before the equinoxes, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 63°26&#x27; North or South, because before the equinoxes the Sun&#x27;s declination is then less than 8°34&#x27; from the Equator;

* During the equinoxes, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 72°00&#x27; North or South, because during the equinoxes the Sun is crossing the Equator line;

* In March or September after the equinoxes, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 67°45&#x27; North or South, because after the equinoxes the Sun&#x27;s declination is then less than 4°15&#x27; from the Equator;

* In April or October, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 57°09&#x27; North or South, because the Sun&#x27;s declination is then less than 14°51&#x27; from the Equator;

* In May or November, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 50°03&#x27; North or South, because the Sun&#x27;s declination is then less than 21°57&#x27; from the Equator;

* In June or December, astronomical dawn to sunrise or sunset to astronomical dusk occurs at latitudes less than 48°34&#x27; North or South, because in June the Sun crosses the Tropic of Cancer (about 23°26&#x27; North) and in December the Sun crosses the Tropic of Capricorn (about 23°26&#x27; South).

=== Lasting from one day to the next ===

At latitudes greater than about 48°34&#x27; North or South, on dates near the summer solstice (June 21 in the Northern Hemisphere or December 21 in the Southern Hemisphere), twilight can last from sunset to sunrise, since the Sun does not sink more than 18 degrees below the horizon, so complete darkness does not occur even at solar midnight. These latitudes include many densely populated regions of the Earth, including the entire United Kingdom and other countries in northern Europe and even parts of central Europe. This also occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, but occurs on December 21. This type of twilight also occurs between one day and the next at latitudes within the polar circles shortly before and shortly after the period of midnight sun. The summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is on June 21st, while the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere is on December 21st.

* Civil twilight: between about 60°34&#x27; and 65°44&#x27; north or south. In the northern hemisphere, this includes the center of Alaska, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Faroe Islands, and Shetland. In the southern hemisphere this includes parts of the Southern Ocean and the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. When &quot;civil&quot; twilight lasts all night, this is also referred as a white night.
* Nautical twilight: between about 54°34&#x27; and 60°34&#x27; north or south. In the northern hemisphere this includes the center of Alaska, Russia, Canada, Estonia, Latvia, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, and Denmark. In the southern hemisphere this includes the southernmost point of South America, Ushuaia in Argentina, and Puerto Williams in Chile. When &quot;nautical&quot; twilight lasts all night, this is also referred as a white night.
* Astronomical twilight: between about 48°34&#x27; and 54°34&#x27; north or south. In the northern hemisphere, this includes the center of Isle of Man, Aleutian Islands, United Kingdom, Belarus, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Belgium, Czech Republic, Bellingham, Washington, Orcas Island, Washington, Vancouver, British Columbia, Paris, France, Luxembourg, Guernsey, Ukraine, Slovakia, and Hungary. In the southern hemisphere, this includes the center of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Bouvet Island, Heard Island, Falkland Islands. It also includes El Calafate and Río Gallegos in Argentina, and Puerto Natales in Chile. When &quot;astronomical&quot; twilight lasts all night, this does not constitute a white night. This phenomenon is known as the &quot;&quot;, nights when it does not get dark enough for astronomers to do their observations of the deep sky.

===Between one night and the next===
In Arctic and Antarctic latitudes in wintertime, the polar night only rarely produces complete darkness for 24 hours each day. This can occur only at locations within about 5.5 degrees of latitude of the Pole, and there only on dates close to the winter solstice. At all other latitudes and dates, the polar night includes a daily period of twilight, when the Sun is not far below the horizon. Around winter solstice, when the solar declination changes slowly, complete darkness lasts several weeks at the Pole itself, e.g., from May 11 to July 31 at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station. North Pole has the experience of this from November 13 to January 29.

Solar noon at civil twilight during a polar night: between about 67°24&#x27; and 72°34&#x27; north or south.

Solar noon at nautical twilight during a polar night: between about 72°34&#x27; and 78°34&#x27; north or south.

Solar noon at astronomical twilight during a polar night: between about 78°34&#x27; and 84°34&#x27; north or south.

Solar noon at night during a polar night: between approximately 84°34&#x27; and exactly 90° north or south.

===Lasting for 24 hours===
At latitudes greater than 81°25&#x27; North or South, as the Sun&#x27;s angular elevation difference is less than 18 degrees, twilight can last for the entire 24 hours. This occurs for one day at latitudes near 8°35’ from the Pole and extends up to several weeks the further toward the Pole one goes. This happens both near the North Pole and near the South Pole. The only permanent settlement to experience this condition is Alert, Nunavut, Canada, where it occurs from February 22–26, and again from October 15–19.

==Duration==


The duration of twilight depends on the latitude and the time of the year. The apparent travel of the Sun occurs at the rate of 15 degrees per hour (360° per day), but sunrise and sunset happen typically at oblique angles to the horizon and the actual duration of any twilight period will be a function of that angle, being longer for more oblique angles. This angle of the Sun&#x27;s motion with respect to the horizon changes with latitude as well as the time of year (affecting the angle of the Earth&#x27;s axis with respect to the Sun).

At Greenwich, England (51.5°N), the duration of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending on the time of year. At the equator, civil twilight can last as little as 24 minutes. This is true because at low latitudes the Sun&#x27;s apparent movement is perpendicular to the observer&#x27;s horizon. But at the poles, civil twilight can be as long as 2–3 weeks. In the Arctic and Antarctic regions, twilight (if there is any) can last for several hours. There is no astronomical twilight at the poles near the winter solstice (for about 74 days at the North Pole and about 80 days at the South Pole). As one gets closer to the Arctic and Antarctic circles, the Sun&#x27;s disk moves toward the observer&#x27;s horizon at a lower angle. The observer&#x27;s earthly location will pass through the various twilight zones less directly, taking more time.

Within the polar circles, twenty-four-hour daylight is encountered in summer, and in regions very close to the poles, twilight can last for weeks on the winter side of the equinoxes. Outside the polar circles, where the angular distance from the polar circle is less than the angle which defines twilight (see above), twilight can continue through local midnight near the summer solstice. The precise position of the polar circles, and the regions where twilight can continue through local midnight, varies slightly from year to year with Earth&#x27;s axial tilt. The lowest latitudes at which the various twilights can continue through local midnight are approximately 60.561° (60°33′43″) for civil twilight, 54.561° (54°33′43″) for nautical twilight and 48.561° (48°33′43″) for astronomical twilight.

These are the largest cities of their respective countries where the various twilights can continue through local solar midnight:
* Civil twilight (or white night) from sunset to sunrise: Tampere, Oulu, Umeå, Trondheim, Tórshavn, Reykjavík, Nuuk, Whitehorse, Yellowknife, Anchorage, Fairbanks, Arkhangelsk, Yakutsk, and Baltasound. In the Southern Hemisphere, the only minor permanent settlement to experience this is Villa Las Estrellas, on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, politically part of Chile.
* Nautical twilight (or if brighter, white night) from civil dusk to civil dawn: Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Vitebsk, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, Wejherowo, Flensburg, Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Letterkenny, Petropavl, Nanortalik, Grande Prairie, Juneau, Ushuaia, and Puerto Williams.
* Astronomical twilight (or grey night) from nautical dusk to nautical dawn: Hulun Buir, Erdenet, Nur-Sultan, Samara, Kyiv, Minsk, Alytus, Warsaw, Košice, Paris, Dublin, Zwettl, Prague, Stanley (Falkland Islands), Berlin, Hamburg, Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amsterdam, London, Cardiff, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Unalaska, Bellingham (largest in the continental USA), Rio Gallegos, and Punta Arenas.
* Major cities that near astronomical twilight (or grey night) from nautical dusk to nautical dawn: Khabarovsk (48°29&#x27;0&quot;N), Dnipro (48°27&#x27;0&quot;N), Victoria (48°25&#x27;42&quot;N), Saguenay (48°25′0&quot;N), Brest (48°23′26&quot;N), Thunder Bay (48°22′56″N), Vienna (48°12′30″N), Bratislava (48°8′38″N), Munich (48°8&#x27;0&quot;N), Seattle (47°36’35&quot;N)

Although Helsinki, Oslo, Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg also enter into nautical twilight after sunset, they do have noticeably lighter skies at night during the summer solstice than other locations mentioned in their category above, because they do not go far into nautical twilight. A white night is a night with only civil twilight which lasts from sunset to sunrise.

At the winter solstice within the polar circle, twilight can extend through solar noon at latitudes below 72.561° (72°33′43″) for civil twilight, 78.561° (78°33′43″) for nautical twilight, and 84.561° (84°33′43″) for astronomical twilight.

==On other planets==
Twilight on Mars is longer than on Earth, lasting for up to two hours before sunrise or after sunset. Dust high in the atmosphere scatters light to the night side of the planet. Similar twilights are seen on Earth following major volcanic eruptions.

==In religion ==
=== Christianity ===

In Christian practice, &quot;vigil&quot; observances often occur during twilight on the evening before major feast days or holidays. For example, the &quot;Easter Vigil&quot; is held in the hours of darkness between sunset on Holy Saturday and sunrise on Easter Day – most commonly in the evening of Holy Saturday or midnight – and is the first celebration of Easter, days traditionally being considered to begin at sunset.

=== Hinduism ===
Hinduism prescribes the observance of certain practices during twilight, a period generally called . The period is also called by the poetic form of in Sanskrit, literally &#x27;cow dust&#x27;, referring to the time cows returned from the fields after grazing, kicking up dust in the process. Many rituals, such as Sandhyavandanam and puja, are performed at the twilight hour. Consuming food is not advised during this time. According to some adherents, asuras are regarded to be active during these hours. One of the avatars of Vishnu, Narasimha, is closely associated with the twilight period. According to Hindu scriptures, an asura king, Hiranyakashipu, performed penance and obtained a boon from Brahma that he could not be killed during day or night, neither by human nor animal, neither inside his house nor outside. Vishnu appeared in a half-man half-lion form (neither human nor animal), and ended Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s life at twilight (neither day nor night) while he was placed in the threshold of his house (neither inside nor outside).

=== Islam ===
Twilight is important in Islam as it determines when certain universally obligatory prayers are to be recited. Morning twilight is when morning prayers (Fajr) are done, while evening twilight is the time for evening prayers (Maghrib prayer). Also during Ramadhan, the time for (morning meal before fasting) ends at morning twilight, while fasting ends after sunset. There is also an important discussion in Islamic jurisprudence between &quot;true dawn&quot; and &quot;false dawn&quot;.

=== Judaism ===
In Judaism, twilight is considered neither day nor night; consequently it is treated as a safeguard against encroachment upon either. It can be considered a time. For example, the twilight of Friday is reckoned as Sabbath eve, and that of Saturday as Sabbath day; and the same rule applies to festival days.

<text>Shareholder activism is a form of activism in which shareholders use equity stakes in a corporation to put pressure on its management. A fairly small stake (less than 10% of outstanding shares) may be enough to launch a successful campaign. In comparison, a full takeover bid is a much more costly and difficult undertaking. The goals of shareholder activism range from financial (increase of shareholder value through changes in corporate policy, cost cutting, etc.) to non-financial (disinvestment from particular countries, etc.). Shareholder activists can address self-dealing by corporate insiders, although large stockholders can also engage in self-dealing to themselves at the expense of smaller minority shareholders.

Shareholder activism can take any of several forms: proxy battles, publicity campaigns, shareholder resolutions, litigation, and negotiations with management. Daniel Loeb, head of Third Point Management, is notable for his use of sharply written letters directed towards the CEOs of his target companies.

Activism may help to address the principal-agent problem where the management (agents) do not adequately respond to the wishes of the principals (investors) of publicly traded companies. In the 2010s, investments in the activist asset class grew, with activists receiving coverage by the media and positive attention from investors. Activists have typically engaged in adversarial campaigns, but have also in some cases been able to acquire board seats with a formal proxy context.

Shareholder activists are making their mark on mergers and acquisitions as well – a 2015 survey of corporate development leaders found that 60% of respondents saw shareholder activism affecting transaction activity in their industry. Increasingly, however, the non-financial form of shareholder activism is affecting companies in a range of sectors. Shareholders, often with a comparatively small stake in a company, are seeking to influence the company&#x27;s environmental and social performance.

Some of the recent activist investment funds include: California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System (CalPERS), Icahn Management LP, Santa Monica Partners Opportunity Fund LP, State Board of Administration of Florida (SBA), and Relational Investors, LLC.

Due to the Internet, smaller shareholders have also gained an outlet to voice their opinions. In 2005, small MCI Inc. shareholders created an online petition to protest the MCI/Verizon merger.

== History ==
Corporations in 18th-century Europe were privileged and relatively uncommon, but in the United States became much more common, starting with 300 in the 1790s and expanding by around 26,000 between 1790 and the 1860s, resulting in about 15 times the corporations in Great Britain by 1830. These early corporations contained various provisions for corporate governance, including restricted charters, bylaws, prudent-mean voting rules, dividend payments, and press coverage.

From 1900 to 1950, about 1.22 &quot;offensive&quot; activist initiatives occurred per year, with more occurring in the 1940s and 1950s. Notable investors included Cyrus S. Eaton, Phoenix Securities Corporation, Benjamin Graham, J. Paul Getty, and Malcolm Chace. Activism was likely limited by the lack of ownership dispersion, meaning that many corporations had large shareholders with sizable blocks (10 to 20% of total shares) who already exerted significant control over the corporation.

== Notable investors ==
Notable activist investors include: Isaac Le Maire (1558–1624), Carl Icahn, Nelson Peltz (Trian Partners), Bill Ackman (Pershing Square), Daniel Loeb (Third Point Management), Barry Rosenstein, Larry Robbins (Glenview), David Einhorn, Gregg Hymowitz (EnTrust Global), Larry Fink (BlackRock), Christer Gardell (Cevian Capital), and Ryan Cohen.

During the 1980s, activist investors such as Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens gained international notoriety and were often perceived as &quot;corporate raiders&quot; for acquiring an equity stake in publicly owned companies, like Icahn&#x27;s investment in B.F. Goodrich, and then forcing companies to take action to improve value or rid themselves of rebel intruders like Icahn by buying back the raider&#x27;s investment at a fat premium, often at the expense of the other shareholders. More recently, activist investor Phillip Goldstein suggested that the role of the activist investor has moved from green mail to one of being a catalyst to unlock value in an underlying security, and says that the public perception of activist investors as &quot;corporate raiders&quot; has dissipated.

In 2019, notable activist investors included Starboard Value, Icahn Enterprises, Elliott Investment Management, and Third Point. In 2019, mutual funds such as Wellington Management Company had begun to show signs of activism.

Examples of activist investors in Asia include Oasis Management. 

=== Outreach strategies ===
Activist investors advertise their message out in various ways including postal mail, websites, and social media.

=== Statistics ===
As of 2018, there had been an average of 272 activist campaigns per year in the United States, including 47 proxy contests. About 47% of targeted companies were outside of the United States.

=== Proxy advisory ===
As of 2020, passive investors such as index funds by Vanguard as well as non-activist but still active management investors such as mutual funds play a significant role in corporate governance. These firms use proxy advisory firms such as Institutional Shareholder Services to receive recommendations on how to vote on shareholder proposals.

=== Funding ===
Activist investors are often hedge funds funded by accredited investors and institutions. In 2019, institutions were demanding more upfront explanation of the activist ideas before funding, and in some cases requiring that the funds be placed into special purpose vehicles specifically for the project. Activist hedge funds, which are hedge funds that &quot;take concentrated positions in the equity of public corporations and actively engage with corporate managers&quot; can address the principal-agent problem and limit self-dealing by providing management with high-powered incentives to increase value.

== Offensive versus defensive ==
Shareholder activism can be categorized as &quot;offensive&quot; or &quot;defensive&quot;; in the latter case, an existing shareholder attempts to correct some deficiency, while offensive activists build a position with the intention to agitate for change. Shareholders can also initiative a derivative suit to force action by the corporation. Shareholders can also engage in a securities class action but these are typically not associated with activism.

== Laws ==
In the United States, acquisition of over 5% of beneficial ownership in a company with the intention to influence leadership must be accompanied by a Schedule 13D filing; investors who do not intend to become activists may file a Schedule 13G instead.

=== Proxy access ===
Historically, investors were required to mail separate ballots when trying to nominate someone of their own to the board, but beginning in 2015, proxy access rules began to spread driven by initiatives from major institutional investors, and as of 2018, 71% of S&amp;P 500 companies had a proxy access rule.

=== Voting ===
Votes for the board may be &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;cumulative&quot;. In straight voting (aka statutory voting), shareholders get one vote per share on all ballot questions (e.g., candidates for the board of directors or shareholder proposals). In cumulative voting, a shareholder receives a general vote for however many number of ballot questions there are. The votes can then be all cast for (or against) a single ballot question, which makes it easier for minority shareholders to elect candidates. There has also been a movement toward &quot;majority&quot; voting, where a candidate must receive the majority of votes. Most large corporations are incorporated in Delaware due to the well-developed Delaware General Corporation Law; in Delaware, cumulative voting is optional, but exceptions exist; for example, a California-based but Delaware-registered corporation may be &quot;pseudo-foreign&quot; under California law and therefore have to comply with California law.

== Performance ==

Taking an activist approach to public investing may produce returns in excess of those likely to be achieved passively. A 2012 study by Activist Insight showed that the mean annual net return of over 40 activist-focused hedge funds had consistently outperformed the MSCI world index in the years following the global financial crisis in 2008. Activist investing was the top-performing strategy among hedge funds in 2013, with such firms returning, on average, 16.6% while other hedge funds returned 9.5%.

== Research ==
Shareholder activism directed at both European and American companies has been surging. A 1996 study found that larger firms with higher institutional holdings made firms more likely to be targeted by activist investors. Researchers also try to understand what makes company a desirable target for an activist investor. Lately, both scholars and practitioners started using machine learning methodologies to predict both targets and activists.

== Retail involvement ==
Any shareholder, including non-institutional retail investors, may submit a shareholder proposal in the United States, and between 1934 and the mid-1980s these shareholders typically submitted proposals. One estimate placed institutional owners at 68% of shares and retail at 32% of shares, but 98% of institutional owners vote and only 28% of retail owners vote. Institutional shareholders, however, often vote automatically upon the advice of proxy advisory firms; allowing retail shareholders to vote based upon a guideline (&quot;standing voting instructions&quot;) has been proposed to increase their involvement.

Various websites have been created to facilitate retail involvement, including Moxy Vote, Shareowners.org, United States Proxy Exchange and ProxyDemocracy.org, but over time these generally shut down.

== Political and labor involvement ==
Labor unions, including through pension funds such as CalPERS coalitions such as the Change to Win Federation often engage in shareholder proposals. The Shareholder Rights Group is a coalition of shareholder proposal advocates.

=== Socially responsible investing ===
Organizations such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), As You Sow and Ceres use shareholder resolutions, and other means of pressure, to address issues such as sustainability and human rights.

For an analysis of the hundreds of annual shareholder resolutions, see Proxy Preview.

<text>Józef Kostrzewski (25 February 188519 October 1969) was a Polish archaeologist.

Kostrzewski was born in Węglewo (now in Poznań County). He studied first in Kraków, then from 1910 onwards with Gustaf Kossinna at Berlin and graduated in 1914. Back in Poland, he was to turn Kossinna&#x27;s settlement-archaeological method (&quot;Siedlungsarchäologische Methode&quot;) against its creator and to try to prove a Slavonic autochthonism in Poland from at least the Bronze Age (Lusatian culture) onwards.

Kostrzewski became professor of prehistory at the newly founded University of Poznań in 1919, and from 1934 conducted the excavation of the Iron Age settlement of Biskupin, which he continued after the war.

After 1918, Kostrzewski became involved in bitter polemics about the ethnic ascription of the Lusatian and Pomeranian cultures with the German archaeologist Bolko von Richthofen.

During the German occupation of Poland during World War II, Polish universities and museums were closed, the finds were often transported to Germany, and many scholars were arrested, tortured and detained, or murdered. 

Kostrzewski hid from the Gestapo during the war, but returned to his Poznań chair in 1945. He died in Poznań in 1969, aged 84.

The Ditsong National Museum of Cultural History is housed in the old South African Mint building. The museum was amalgamated with the Pretoria-based Transvaal Museum for Natural History (now the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History and the Johannesburg-based South African National Museum of Military History on 1 April 1999 to form the Northern Flagship Institution (NFI).

In April 2010 the new name was launched, and the NFI became Ditsong Museums of South Africa. Ditsong is managed by a chief executive officer and a board, which replaced the three separate previous museum boards.

<text>The Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical is an honor presented at the Tony Awards, a ceremony established in 1947 as the Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre, to actresses for quality leading roles in a musical play, whether a new production or a revival. The awards are named after Antoinette Perry, an American actress who died in 1946.

Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the Tony Award Productions, a joint venture of The Broadway League and the American Theatre Wing, to &quot;honor the best performances and stage productions of the previous year.&quot;

The award was originally called the Tony Award for Actresses—Musical. It was first presented to Grace Hartman at the 2nd Tony Awards for her portrayal of various characters in &quot;Angel in the Wings&quot;. Before 1956, nominees&#x27; names were not made public; the change was made by the awards committee to &quot;have a greater impact on theatregoers&quot;.

In 1965, Liza Minnelli, age 19, became the youngest actress to win the award. She is followed by Lea Salonga, age 20, in 1991. In 2017, Bette Midler, age 71, became the oldest actress to win the award. She is followed by Victoria Clark, age 63, in 2023.

Angela Lansbury holds the record as the performer with the most wins in this category, with a total of four. Chita Rivera has the most nominations, with eight. The characters of Rose in Gypsy and Anna Leonowens in The King and I currently hold the record for most wins, each winning three times. Rose also holds the record for most nominations, with five.

<doc id="526272" wikidata="Q2583379" url="?curid=526272" title="Ditsong National Museum of Natural History">
<text>The Ditsong National Museum of Natural History, formerly the Transvaal Museum, is a natural history museum situated in Pretoria, South Africa. It is located on Paul Kruger Street, between Visagie and Minnaar Streets, opposite the Pretoria City Hall. The museum was established in 1895 by the former South African Republic, also known as the Transvaal. In 2010 it was one of the founding museums of Ditsong Museums of South Africa.

==Collections==
The museum curates large collections of Plio-Pleistocene fossils, including hominids from Sterkfontein, Swartkrans and Kromdraai in the UNESCO World Heritage Site; the Cradle of Humankind, as well as late Permian therapsids (proto-mammals from the Karoo). The most complete skull of an &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; specimen, Mrs Ples, is on display in the museum. In addition, the Transvaal museum houses extensive collections of mammals, birds, reptiles, and invertebrates.

==History==
It was founded as the &quot;Staatsmuseum&quot; (Afrikaans for &quot;State Museum&quot;) of the ZAR on 1 December 1892, and J. W. B. Gunning was appointed as its first director. For the first two years after it was founded, the museum was located in the Ou Raadsaal parliament building.

The Transvaal Museum was amalgamated with the Pretoria-based National Cultural History Museum (also called the African Window) and the South African National Museum of Military History (situated in Johannesburg) on 1 April 1999 to form the Northern Flagship Institution. The NFI was officially renamed Ditsong Museums of South Africa in April 2010. The Transvaal Museum was renamed Ditsong National Museum of Natural History on the same date. Ditsong is managed by a chief executive officer and a board, which replaced the three separate previous museum boards.

<text>The Explorer plate is an oceanic tectonic plate beneath the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada, which is partially subducted under the North American plate. Along with the Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate, the Explorer plate is a remnant of the ancient Farallon plate, which has been subducted under the North American plate. The Explorer plate separated from the Juan de Fuca plate roughly 4 million years ago. In its smoother, southern half, the average depth of the Explorer plate is roughly and rises up in its northern half to a highly variable basin between and in depth.

== Boundaries ==

The eastern boundary of the Explorer plate is being subducted under the North American plate. The southern boundary is a collection of transform faults, the Sovanco fracture zone, separating the Explorer plate from the Pacific plate. To the southeast is another transform boundary, the Nootka Fault, which separates the Explorer plate from the Juan de Fuca plate and forms a triple junction with the North American plate. To the northwest is a divergent boundary with the Pacific plate forming the Explorer Ridge, and the Winona Basin located within the northwest boundaries and the Pacific continental shelf. The Queen Charlotte triple junction is located where the Pacific plate and North American plate meets with the Explorer plate.

== Formation and evolution ==
Upon breaking apart 4 million years ago, the Juan De Fuca plate continued moving northeast at 26 mm/year (1 in/year) while the Explorer plate&#x27;s velocity changed, stalling or moving slowly north up to 20 mm/year. The Nootka Fault boundary between the Juan De Fuca plate and the Explorer plate has varied in length and direction since their separation. The formation of the Nookta Fault and the shearing of plate boundaries has caused a clockwise rotation, reorienting the Sovanco fracture zone northwards along the North American plate and slowing the Explorer plate&#x27;s subduction. The Sovanco fracture zone originated as a spreading center offset more than 7 million years ago which shows southward movement from the influence of the Explorer ridge and results in uneven spreading eastward unto the Explorer plate.

== Current state of subduction ==
The subducted portion of the plate extends downward to more than 300 km (186 mi) depth, and laterally as far as mainland Canada. The relative buoyancy of the subducting plate and the underlying mantle may be inhibiting the Explorer plate&#x27;s ability to descend further into the mantle.

There is an ongoing debate regarding the process of subduction of the Explorer plate and how the boundary between the Explorer plate and the North American plate are defined:
# The Explorer plate has stopped and may eventually accrete, fusing with the North American plate as the subduction has fully stopped and will eventually become a plate boundary between the North American plate and Pacific plate rather than continuing its subduction.
# The Explorer plate consists of two parts with half being fused to the North American plate and the other half remaining a microplate system.
# The Explorer plate has slowed to a terminal speed of 20 mm/year, and will continue until the entire plate is subducted.

== Seismic activity ==
As a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Explorer plate has a high level of seismic activity. However, the activity consists of low-magnitude events; no earthquake above magnitude 6.5 has been recorded in the region, though a swarm of several dozen magnitude 5–6 earthquakes occurred just north of the Seminole Seamount in 2008. The Explorer plate is the most seismically active area of Canada, but is anomalous as a subduction zone since most of the seismic activity occurs around the plate&#x27;s perimeter rather than at the subduction interface. Events are generally centered around the southern and north-western areas where the borders of the plate are in contact with other plates; however, the newer ocean crust created at Explorer ridge and Juan de Fuca ridge reduces the rigidity of the region and contributes to the low magnitude of events in the region.

<text>Tin Toy is a 1988 American animated short film produced by Pixar and directed by John Lasseter. The short film, which runs for five minutes, stars Tinny, a tin one-man band toy, trying to escape from Billy, a human baby. The third short film produced by the company&#x27;s small animation division, it was a risky investment: due to the low revenue produced by Pixar&#x27;s main product, the Pixar Image Computer, the company was under financial constraints.

Lasseter pitched the concept for &quot;Tin Toy&quot; by storyboard to Pixar owner Steve Jobs, who agreed to finance the short despite the company&#x27;s struggles, which he kept alive with annual investment. The film was officially a test of the PhotoRealistic RenderMan software and proved new challenges to the animation team, namely the difficult task of realistically animating Billy. &quot;Tin Toy&quot; later gained attention from Disney, who sealed an agreement to create &quot;Toy Story&quot; starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, which was primarily inspired by elements from &quot;Tin Toy&quot;.

The short film debuted in a completed edit at the SIGGRAPH convention in August 1988 to a standing ovation from scientists and engineers. The film went on to claim Pixar&#x27;s first Academy Award with the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, becoming the first animated film made using computer-generated imagery to win an Academy Award. With the award, &quot;Tin Toy&quot; went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. In 2003, &quot;Tin Toy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In a living room, a toy one-man band player named Tinny looks around and sees a baby named Billy arrive. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the infant can be. When Tinny tries to walk out of Billy&#x27;s reach, the musical instruments on the former&#x27;s back begin to play, attracting Billy&#x27;s attention. Tinny begins to run but is pursued by Billy. During a pursuit with the excited Billy pursuing him, Tinny soon finds cover under a couch, there he finds a collection of toys in hiding, also seemingly afraid of Billy, because too terrified to come out, they have gone through the same experience. Still, however, unaware of this, Billy accidentally trips, and falls over on the hardwood floor face first while walking and searching for Tinny, and begins to cry. Feeling sorry for the baby, Tinny sees this leaves his couch sanctuary, and begins to play near Billy to calm him down. Upon seeing this, Billy stops crying and picks up Tinny to play with, the latter fearing the worst. However, Billy soon lets go of the toy, more interested in his packaging, but ignores Tinny, and then plays with the box that Tinny came in. This annoys Tinny, who, mad, again plays music, tries following around Billy in hopes of being noticed, and goes to pursue him, but is still mad and ignored, and ends up trying to stop him no matter where Billy goes with Tinny pursuing him. Eventually, Billy, whose face is now covered in a shopping bag, leaves the room, followed by Tinny as the credits roll. With Billy gone, the newly optimistic toys from underneath the couch are safe to come out.

==Background==
Pixar, purchased in 1986 by entrepreneur and former Apple Computer head Steve Jobs, received many accolades for films produced by its small animation division, headed by former Disney animator John Lasseter. Lasseter&#x27;s primary role, as defended to Jobs by company founders Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, was to produce short films to promote the company&#x27;s own Pixar Image Computers. The department was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned, but after the release of two shorts, &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; (1986) and &quot;Red&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1987), some of the engineers working on the company&#x27;s products wondered whether it made sense to keep the animation group going at all. Pixar was losing money every year and Jobs was supporting the cash-strapped company SO through a line of credit with his personal guarantee.

The engineers felt they were working hard to make money for Pixar while Lasseter&#x27;s group was only spending it. Their passion was for building computers and software, not entertainment. Eventually, they discerned, to their chagrin, the reason why the company was supporting the division: the real priority of Catmull and Smith was to make films. The engineers were not alone in wondering about the value of Lasseter&#x27;s short films. On repeated occasions in the late 1980s, Catmull barely dissuaded Jobs from shutting down the animation division due to financial constraints. At this same time, Jobs was clashing with Alvy Ray Smith, which would eventually lead to his resignation from Pixar after a heated argument during a meeting. Things were by no means well at the company and Lasseter and his team of animators knew this, and were afraid to ask for money to finance another short, which they storyboarded as &quot;Tin Toy&quot;.

==Production==
In the spring of 1988, cash was running so short that Jobs convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. &quot;Tin Toy&quot; would require close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards. Catmull took him down to the animation offices, and Lasseter started his show. With the storyboards pinned on his wall, Lasseter did the voices and acted out the shots—just as story men had done on the Disney lot for decades—and thereby showed his passion for the project. The stakes here were much higher than before, however. Ralph Guggenheim, manager of the animation unit, recalled, &quot;We knew that he wasn&#x27;t just pitching for the film, he was pitching for the survival of the group.&quot; Jobs warmed up to the project and agreed to provide the money. &quot;I believed in what John was doing,&quot; Jobs later said. &quot;It was art. He cared, and I cared. I always said yes.&quot; His only comment at the end of Lasseter&#x27;s presentation was, &quot;All I ask of you, John, is to make it great.&quot;

That fall, after completion of &quot;Red&#x27;s Dream&quot;, most members of the company gathered at Stillwater Cove, near Fort Ross, to design new software that was designed completely for the work of an animator. From the meeting came Menv software (&quot;modeling Environment&quot;), the first program specifically designed to facilitate the workflow of an animator, separating the various phases of the animation (modeling, animation and lighting), later renamed &quot;Puppets&quot;. To show the application of the new program, it was approved the production of a short. Inspired by the birth of his daughter Julia, William Reeves proposed the idea to create a human baby. Lasseter had an inspiration for the new opera based on the observation of his nephew, intent to put any toy in the mouth on the way. Lasseter said, &quot;In terms of toys the child must have seemed a terrible monster!&quot;

The story was about Lasseter&#x27;s love, classic toys, and was inspired by a visit made in 1987 at the Tin Toy Museum in Yokohama, Japan. It was told from the perspective of a toy one-man band named Tinny, who meets a baby that charms and terrorizes him. Escaping under the couch, Tinny finds other frightened toys, but when the baby hits his head and cries, Tinny goes back out to cheer him up. &quot;Tin Toy&quot; was inspired much like &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot;, namely, Lasseter&#x27;s observations of a friend&#x27;s baby. This time, he opted for a more ambitious task, attempting to mimic a human baby in its appearance, the movement of its arms, and its fickle moods.

The short film was officially a test of the PhotoRealistic RenderMan software. This was the only Pixar short rendered on the RM-1, a RenderMan specific computer that was never sold to the public. As with &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; and &quot;Red&#x27;s Dream&quot;, it was also a chance for Lasseter to one-up his earlier efforts, taking his animation and storytelling to another level. The baby proved difficult to model and animate; &quot;it just became an incredible burden,&quot; remembered Flip Phillips, a new member of the team at the time. In early attempts at a model of the baby&#x27;s head, he appeared to have the face of a middle-aged man. The final version of the baby (known to the team as Billy) had a much-improved face with 40 separate facial muscles, but his skin had the look of plastic. When he moved, moreover, his body lacked the natural give of baby fat and his diaper had the solidity of cement—compromises made necessary by lack of time and the still-developing technology.

The picture on the table is a photograph of director John Lasseter.

==Release==
Lasseter and his technical directors slept under their desks at times to get &quot;Tin Toy&quot; finished before SIGGRAPH in Atlanta in August 1988, but to no avail. What the SIGGRAPH audience saw was the first three-fifths or so of the film, ending a cliffhanger moment with Tinny running into his box and watching in horror through the box&#x27;s cellophane as Billy advances towards him. &quot;Even though it wasn&#x27;t complete, people were wowed by it,&quot; producer Ralph Guggenheim remembered. The audience of scientists and engineers to which it was shown at SIGGRAPH greeted it with a standing ovation. These praises were joined over the years, positive assessments of public and critics, who praised the innovation and technology in it. Luke Bonanno called it &quot;One of the best Pixar short films,&quot; while other critics wrote that the film was &quot;A fascinating glimpse of a fledgling art form.&quot; and many praised the ability to move in just a few minutes and have been able to &quot;encompass the full range of emotions you feel when a toy is used by a child.&quot; Some criticisms were leveled at the character of Billy, who was called &quot;the most frightening and disturbing piece of animation in the history of this art form.&quot; Dario Floreano stated that the uncanny valley concept was taken seriously by the film industry because of negative audience reactions to Billy. It is unknown when this short was first released in its entirety.

&quot;Tin Toy&quot; went on to take the Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1989 at the 61st Academy Awards, it was the third CGI short film to get nominated for the Academy Award (behind &quot;Hunger&quot; and &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot;) and was the first CGI animated short film to receive an Academy Award. With the award, &quot;Tin Toy&quot; went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. A member of the Academy&#x27;s board of governors, animator William Littlejohn, saw in &quot;Tin Toy&quot; a window into the potential of the young medium. &quot;There is a realism that&#x27;s rather astonishing,&quot; he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;It emulates photography, but with artistic staging.&quot; Robert Winquist, head of the character animation program at CalArts, went further, predicting that computer animation was &quot;going to take over in a short time.&quot; He publicly advised animators, &quot;Put down your pencil and your paintbrush and do it another way.&quot;

The short film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; in 2003. &quot;Tin Toy&quot; garnered some home media releases via inclusion on &quot;Tiny Toy Stories&quot; in 1996, the VHS and DVD releases of &quot;Toy Story&quot; in 2000&quot;,&quot; and the &quot;Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1&quot; (2007). &quot;Tin Toy&quot; is also available for streaming on Disney+.

==Merchandising==
Apart from the home video editions of the short film, &quot;Tin Toy&quot; was not the subject of any type of merchandise, like all of the other short films that have been produced by the company. The only exception is the reproduction of vinyl Tinny, produced by MINDStyle in 2010. Pixar, in fact, sold the license to the manufacturer of &quot;Tin Toy&quot; MINDStyle objects, which created a maquette of the vinyl character Tinny inside of the line Art Toy Collectible limited Edition of 500 pieces, the price of ninety dollars. The box, which is a faithful reproduction of the packaging of the toy view in short, in addition to containing the model of Tinny, presents a certificate of authenticity printed on a card showing the storyboard in pencil of a scene from the short.

==Cancelled holiday special==
The success of &quot;Tin Toy&quot; gained attention from Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who approached Pixar to produce a computer-animated film. In the early 1990s, Pixar began to make arrangements with Disney to produce the first computer-animated film. The project went through, but considering the abrupt transition from shorts to feature a few minutes to an hour and a half, Pixar set out to create a special half-hour to see if they could manage a production that was similar to that of an actual film. Driven by the victory at the Oscars that year, a sequel to &quot;Tin Toy&quot; called &quot;A Tin Toy Christmas,&quot; was originally planned as a half-hour-long television special to be used to convince film studios that Pixar was capable of producing a feature film. This idea was brought to the table at the initial talks with Disney for &quot;Toy Story&quot;. The basic idea was that Tinny was part of a set of toy players who are not successful and remain unsold for years. Separated from other components, Tinny ends up by mistake in a toy shop of our age where he meets several characters, including a soft pink bear named Lotso.

The project was abandoned because the television network that would have produced the film could not afford the fees required (according to director Pete Docter, the special would have required a sum of eighteen times higher than the allowed budget). Disney was uninterested in the concept and urged Pixar to produce a feature immediately, which became a critical and commercial success. The character of Lotso, however, was adapted for &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, as the main villain.

Tinny himself makes a cameo in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, appearing when Woody and Bo Peep enter a pinball machine to meet Duke Caboom.

<doc id="526280" wikidata="Q1162445" url="?curid=526280" title="River Lune">
<text>The River Lune (archaically sometimes Loyne) is a river in length in Cumbria and Lancashire, England.

==Etymology==
Several elucidations for the origin of the name &quot;Lune&quot; exist. Firstly, it may be that the name is Brittonic in genesis and derived from &quot;*lǭn&quot; meaning &quot;full, abundant&quot;, or &quot;healthy, pure&quot; (c.f. Old Irish &quot;slán&quot;, Welsh &quot;llawn&quot;). Secondly, &quot;Lune&quot; may represent Old English &quot;Ēa Lōn&quot; (&quot;ēa&quot; = &quot;river&quot;) as a phonetic adaptation of a Romano-British name referring to a Romano-British god Ialonus who was worshipped in the area.

== Springs ==
The river begins as a stream at Newbiggin, in the parish of Ravenstonedale, Cumbria, at St. Helen&#x27;s Well (elevation of above sea level) and some neighbouring springs. On the first two miles of its course, it is joined by four streams, two of them as short as itself, but two much longer. These are the Bessy Beck (short), the Dry Beck of 4.9 kilometres&#x27; (three miles) length at from St. Helen&#x27;s Well, the Sandwath Beck (short) at , and the Weasdale Beck (5.58 km = 3½ mls) at 1.6 miles from the well. Weasdale Beck is the uppermost headwater of River Lune recorded in Environment Agency&#x27;s Catchment Data Explorer.

== Course and valleys ==
It then passes the remnants of a Roman fort near Low Borrowbridge at the foot of Borrowdale, and flows through south Cumbria, meeting the Irish Sea at Plover Scar near Lancaster, after a total journey of about .

The valley of the Lune has three parts. The northern part between its source and Tebay is called Lunesdale. Below this is the spectacular Lune Gorge through which both the M6 motorway and the West Coast Main Railway Line run. Below the gorge, the valley broadens out into Lonsdale.

Bridges over the Lune include the Devil&#x27;s Bridge near Kirkby Lonsdale and the Lune Millennium Bridge in Lancaster. At Caton, about upstream from Lancaster, there is a cluster of three bridges (one stone road bridge and two disused iron rail bridges now used as foot/cyclepaths) at the &quot;Crook o&#x27; Lune&quot;. Here in a 180-degree right-hand bend the Lune turns back on itself; this is followed by a 90-degree left-hand bend forming the shape of a shepherd&#x27;s crook and creating a beauty spot which was painted by J. M. W. Turner. The M6 motorway crosses the Lune near Tebay and Halton-on-Lune; in 2015 it was joined by the Heysham to M6 Link Road. The Ingleton branch line, a railway operational between 1861 and 1967, followed the Lune between Tebay and Kirkby Lonsdale, crossing the river twice on viaducts which still stand.
== Estuary ==
The river is a County Biological Heritage Site. Near the end of the non-tidal reach of the river stands the Lune Aqueduct, which carries the Lancaster Canal. The Lune is now tidal only below Skerton Weir in Lancaster. Four bridges in close proximity cross the estuary in Lancaster: Skerton Bridge (road), Greyhound Bridge (built as rail but now carries a road), Lune Millennium Bridge (pedestrian and cycle) and Carlisle Bridge (carrying the West Coast Main Line railway, and with a public walkway on the eastern side) which is the furthest downstream of the bridges. 

This part of the Lune is also the site of the old Port of Lancaster, probably a port from Roman times; the Lancaster Port Commission was established in 1750 to improve navigation on the estuary. Between 1750 and 1767, St George&#x27;s Quay and New Quay were built in Lancaster and in 1779 the port facilities were extended closer to the Irish Sea at Glasson Dock. In 1847 the Commissioners built a pair of lighthouses near Cockersand Abbey to help guide ships into the port. The lower lighthouse, known as the Plover Scar Lighthouse, (sometimes called Abbey lighthouse) still stands on Plover Scar, and it remains operational. The old high light, a square wooden tower, was demolished in 1954; but the former keepers&#x27; cottage, built alongside the high light, can still be seen.

Lancaster, in turn Lancashire, is named after the Lune. The dale gave its name to the ancient Lancashire hundred of Lonsdale and the ancient Westmorland ward of Lonsdale.

==In literature==

An engraving of a picture by J. Henderson entitled &#x27;The Vale of Lonsdale&#x27; appears in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1832 together with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. The plate shows Ingleborough in the background.

Jane Edmondson original title for &quot;Quaker Pioneers in Russia&quot; was &quot;From the Lune to the Neva&quot; ie from the Lune river where her parents (George &amp; Anne Edmondson) came from, to the River Neva, in St Petersburg where she was born as part of the Quaker experiment by Daniel Wheeler who went with 32 Quakers to St Petersburg at the request of Emperor Alexander I, in order to drain the marshes so that the then capital of Russia could expand. Publication date 1902 Religious Society of Friends, Publisher London, Headley Bros.

== Rescue incidents and agencies ==
The River Lune over the years has been subject to many rescue incidents, some fatal. The majority of incidents occur below Skerton Weir in the tidal area, or around the weir itself. HM Coastguard have operational primacy over incidents up to the high water mark, with their nearest team based in Morecambe. Flanking teams at Knott End and Arnside will often assist.

Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service Fire appliance at Lancaster maintains a water rescue service, with specially trained swiftwater rescue personnel. The nearest fire service boat is based at Preston fire station and this is often called to assist the swiftwater rescue personnel in carrying out rescues or providing safety cover for the crews.

In 2018 Lancaster Area Search and Rescue established themselves within the city. Part of the Surf Lifesaving Great Britain (SLSGB) family, their main role is to provide water rescue personnel and resources to flood and other water incidents within the Lancaster district at times when the statutory services require assistance. The team is equipped with rescue sleds and a powered inflatable boat for use on the river.

The RNLI can also be seen on the river fairly regularly, including both the D class and their Hovercraft, The Hurley Flyer. Rather than transit to scene from the Lifeboat station, the RNLI will often drive to the scene, often launching at Snatchems Golden Ball pub.

<doc id="526281" wikidata="Q1394956" url="?curid=526281" title="Walter Murch">
<text>Walter Scott Murch (born July 12, 1943) is an American film editor, director, writer and sound designer. His work includes &quot;THX 1138&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;The Godfather I&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, and &quot;III&quot;, &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;The English Patient&quot;, with three Academy Award wins (from nine nominations: six for picture editing and three for sound mixing). 

For his work on &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, Murch was the first person to receive a credit as &quot;Sound Designer.&quot; Murch was also the editor and re-recording mixer of &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot;. In 1998, producer Rick Schmidlin chose Murch as his editor for the restoration of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;. Murch is the author of a popular book on film editing, &quot;In the Blink of an Eye&quot;, and is the subject of Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s book &quot;The Conversations&quot;. Famed movie critic Roger Ebert called Murch &quot;the most respected film editor and sound designer in the modern cinema.&quot; David Thomson calls Murch &quot;the scholar, gentleman and superb craftsman of modern film&quot;, adding that in sound and editing, &quot;he is now without a peer.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Murch was born in New York City, New York, the son of Katharine (née Scott) and Canadian-born painter Walter Tandy Murch (1907–1967). He is the grandson of Louise Tandy Murch, a music teacher who was the subject of the 1975 documentary film &quot;At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch&quot; and of Mary Elizabeth MacCallum Scott, a Canadian physician, educator and Christian medical missionary, who with her husband Thomas Beckett Scott MD, established the Green Memorial Hospital in Manipay, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon).

As a boy, he began to experiment with sound recording, taping unusual sounds and layering them into new combinations. He attended The Collegiate School, a private preparatory school in Manhattan, from 1949 to 1961. In the summer of 1961 he worked as a music librarian and production assistant at Riverside Church&#x27;s newly founded radio station WRVR, now WLTW. He assisted with the July 29th 1961 live broadcast of a 12-hour folk music Hootenanny produced by Izzy Young. This featured, among many other acts, the first radio performance of the 20-year-old Bob Dylan. Murch then attended Johns Hopkins University from 1961 to 1965, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in the liberal arts. Murch spent the university school year 1963–1964 in Europe, studying Romance Languages and the History of Art in Italy at Perugia and in France at the Sorbonne.

While at Johns Hopkins, he met future director/screenwriter Matthew Robbins, cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, and philosopher Andrew Feenberg, with whom he staged a number of happenings. In 1965, Murch and Robbins enrolled in the graduate program of the University of Southern California&#x27;s film school, encouraging Deschanel to follow them. There all three encountered, and became friends with, fellow students such as George Lucas, Hal Barwood, Robert Dalva, Willard Huyck, Don Glut and John Milius; all of these men would go on to be successful filmmakers. Not long after film school, in 1969, Murch and others joined Francis Ford Coppola and Lucas at American Zoetrope in San Francisco. Murch and his family settled in Bolinas, California, in 1972.

== Career ==
Murch started editing and mixing sound with Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969). Subsequently, he worked on George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;THX 1138&quot; and &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; before editing picture and mixing sound on Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation,&quot; for which he received an Academy Award nomination in sound in 1974. Murch also mixed the sound for Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; which was released in 1974, the same year as &quot;The Conversation&quot;. He did picture editing and sound design work on &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, for which he won his first Academy Award in 1979 and he was also significantly involved in the re-editing work that resulted in the extended &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; in 2001.

In 1985, he directed his only feature film, &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, which he co-wrote with Gill Dennis. After the film failed at the box office and displeased many critics with its dark tone and themes, he never directed another film.

In 1988, Murch was one of the editors on &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being,&quot; directed by Philip Kaufman.

Murch edits in a standing position, comparing the process of film editing to &quot;conducting, brain surgery and short-order cooking&quot; since all conductors, cooks, and surgeons stand when they work. In contrast, when writing, he does so lying down. His reason for this is that where editing film is an editorial process, the creative process of writing is opposite that, and so he lies down rather than sit or stand up, to separate his editing mind from his creating mind.

Murch has written one book on film editing, &quot;In the Blink of an Eye&quot; (1995), which has been translated into many languages including Chinese, Italian, Hebrew, Spanish, French, German, Hungarian and Persian. His book describes many of his notable techniques used in his film editing. One of his most praised techniques he refers to as &quot;the rule of six&quot; referring to the six criteria in a film that he examines when making a cut. In his book, Murch also describes editing as more of a psychological practice with a goal of anticipating and controlling the thoughts of the audience.

Before this, he wrote the foreword to Michel Chion&#x27;s &quot;Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen&quot; (1994). He was also the subject of Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s book &quot;The Conversations&quot; (2002), which consists of several conversations between Ondaatje and Murch; the book emerged from Murch&#x27;s editing of &quot;The English Patient&quot;, which was based on Ondaatje&#x27;s novel of the same name.

In 2007, the documentary &quot;Murch&quot; premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival, which centered on Murch and his thoughts on filmmaking.

In 2012, Murch&#x27;s translations of short stories by the Italian writer Curzio Malaparte were published as &quot;The Bird That Swallowed Its Cage&quot;.

== Innovations and awards ==
While he was editing directly on film, Murch took notice of the crude splicing used for the daily rough-cuts. In response, he invented a modification which concealed the splice by using extremely narrow but strongly adhesive strips of special polyester-silicone tape. He called his invention &quot;N-Vis-O&quot;.

In 1979, he won an Oscar for the sound mix of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; as well as a nomination for picture editing. The movie was among the first stereo films to be mixed using an automated console. Additionally, the film is the first to credit anyone as Sound Designer, a professional designation that Murch is widely attributed to have coined as a means to help legitimize the field of post-production sound, much in the way William Cameron Menzies coined the term &quot;Production Designer&quot; in the 1930s.

&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was also notable for being the second film released in a Dolby sound system that has come to be known as 5.1, with three screen speaker channels, low-frequency enhancement, and two surround channels (one more channel than standard surround sound arrangements at the time). The movie was initially seen and heard in this 70mm six-track format in only 17 theaters, some of which also featured prototypes of the Model 650 subwoofer developed by John and Helen Meyer. In recent years, Murch has asserted that the Meyer Sound subwoofers were more &quot;emotionally significant&quot; to the film&#x27;s presentations than were the two surround channels.

In 1996, Murch worked on Anthony Minghella&#x27;s &quot;The English Patient&quot;, which was based on Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s novel of the same name. Murch won Oscars both for his sound mixing and for his editing. Murch&#x27;s editing Oscar was the first to be awarded for an electronically edited film (using the Avid system), and he is the only person ever to win Oscars for both sound mixing and film editing.

In 2003, Murch edited another Anthony Minghella film, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; on Apple&#x27;s sub-$1000 Final Cut Pro software using off the shelf Power Mac G4 computers. This was a leap for such a big-budget film, where expensive Avid systems were usually the standard non-linear editing system. He received an Academy Award nomination for this work; his efforts on the film were documented in Charles Koppelman&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Behind the Seen&quot;.

In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters by the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Vancouver, Canada.

In 2009, Murch&#x27;s work was the subject of a tribute, &quot;The Art of Walter Murch,&quot; a program in &quot;The Professionals,&quot; a series by the California Film Institute at the Christopher B. Smith Rafael Film Center.

In 2012, Murch was invited to serve as a mentor for the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, an international philanthropic program that pairs masters in their disciplines with emerging talents for a year of one-to-one creative exchange. Out of a gifted field of candidates, Murch chose Italian film editor Sara Fgaier as his protégée. Previous film mentors for the initiative include Mira Nair (2004), Stephen Frears (2006), Martin Scorsese (2008) and Zhang Yimou (2010).

Murch is the 2012 recipient of the Nikola Tesla Award given by the International Press Academy Satellite Awards for &quot;Visionary Achievement in Filmmaking Technology&quot;. Previous recipients have included Douglas Trumbull, James Cameron, Roger Deakins, Dennis Muren and George Lucas.

In 2015, Murch was presented with the Vision Award Nescens, at the 68th Locarno Film Festival, for his contributions to cinema. The two previous recipients of the award, initiated in 2013, were Douglas Trumbull and Garrett Brown. 

In 2016, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of media by the Southampton Solent University in Southampton, England along with Anne Coates who received an honorary Doctorate of Arts.

Murch has a long term association with the University of Hertfordshire; initially contributing an oral history interview with The Elstree Project in 2013. There is a dedicated post-production lab on the Hertfordshire campus named for Murch which opened in 2015. In 2018, Murch was awarded an honorary doctorate of arts by the University, for his contribution to the film industry in the county of Hertfordshire, his contribution towards The Elstree Project, and the Film and Television Production degrees. Murch and Hertfordshire&#x27;s Head of Post-Production lecturer Howard Berry teamed up to create the documentary &quot;Her Name Was Moviola&quot;, which received its premiere in 2024. Students from Berry&#x27;s film degree worked on the film as crew.

<doc id="526283" wikidata="Q7560096" url="?curid=526283" title="Something Fresh">
<text>Something Fresh is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published as &quot;Something New&quot; in the United States, by D. Appleton &amp; Company on 3 September 1915. It was published in the United Kingdom as &quot;Something Fresh&quot; by Methuen &amp; Co. on 16 September 1915. There are a number of differences between the American and British versions, but essentially, it is the same book. The novel introduces Lord Emsworth of Blandings Castle, whose home and family reappear in many of Wodehouse&#x27;s later short stories and novels.

The story is a comic caricature of English aristocratic life and the American aristocracy of wealth. The servants of the English country house, who follow a very elaborate hierarchy and take meals at many different social levels, mimic their betters, &quot;and in so doing make their betters look absurd&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Ashe Marson and his fellow lodger Joan Valentine discover that they both work as writers for the Mammoth Publishing Company. Joan urges Ashe to overcome his discontentment and take a fresh direction in life.

Meanwhile, Freddie Threepwood, younger son of the Earl of Emsworth, is engaged to marry Aline Peters, the daughter of American millionaire J. Preston Peters. Freddie pays a visit to a shady fixer, R. Jones, hoping to recover letters he once sent to a certain chorus girl, feeling they might be used to make a breach of promise case against him. His father later calls on Aline&#x27;s father to view his collection of scarabs and absent-mindedly puts Mr Peters&#x27; prize exhibit in his pocket. Though Peters suspects the Earl, he cannot confront him for fear of endangering his daughter&#x27;s marriage.

Aline is being pursued by George Emerson, a Hong Kong police officer, who wishes to marry her. Having befriended Freddie Threepwood, George has been invited to Blandings Castle, the family home, at the same time that Aline and her father are paying a visit. R. Jones finds the address of Freddie&#x27;s ex-sweetheart, Joan Valentine, who tells him she has long since destroyed any letters she may have had from Freddie. As Jones is leaving, Aline, a former school friend of Joan, arrives on a visit, and the suspicious Jones listens at the door. Hearing that Aline&#x27;s father is offering £1,000 to anybody who can retrieve his scarab, Joan decides that she will go herself to Blandings, posing as Aline&#x27;s maid, so as to recover the scarab and scoop the reward. Acting separately, Ashe answers a newspaper advert and is engaged as his valet by Mr. Peters, who is looking for somebody to steal back the scarab during his visit to Blandings.

Ashe informs Joan about this as they both take the train from London. During the trip Joan warns Ashe of the complicated system of etiquette observed among servants of a large house. She hopes this will persuade him to give up his quest and remove himself as her competitor. After their arrival, Ashe is terrified to be interviewed by the butler, Beach, and has to listen to a recital of his troubles with his feet and his stomach. Mr Peters also has stomach trouble and Ashe threatens him with non-cooperation unless he takes some exercise and stops smoking cigars.

At night, Ashe and Joan are both trying to get at the scarab when Lord Emsworth&#x27;s watchful secretary, Rupert Baxter, nearly catches them. Next morning, Ashe and Joan decide to become allies and, after flipping a coin, agree to take turns at stealing the scarab. Since Aline is following the same reduced diet as her father, George steals downstairs to prepare her a midnight feast and collides with Ashe in the dark hall. They start a noisy fight but escape after the suspicious Baxter trips over them and is found surrounded by food and broken china by the time the lights are turned on. He is blamed for waking everyone and roundly criticised by Lord Emsworth for going in search of food in the middle of the night.

The next night is Joan&#x27;s turn to make her attempt, but she finds the scarab has already gone. Putting together clues, she and Ashe discover that Freddie needs money to pay R. Jones, who is pretending that Joan is demanding it for the return of his letters. But Freddie is an admirer of the detective tales that Ashe writes and decides to trust him, confessing to the theft and returning the scarab. As Ashe leaves, Lord Emsworth arrives to announce that Aline has eloped on the train to London with George Emerson, who has been recalled to Hong Kong. Freddie is more relieved than hurt at this revelation.

When Ashe returns the scarab, Mr Peters offers to take Ashe back to America as his personal trainer in reward for the improvement in his health. Ashe hesitates long enough to ask Joan to marry him, and she admits she has been grieving at what seems to be the end of their partnership; as a result, a scullery maid looking out of the window has her dull life enriched as she sees them kissing.

==Background==
As a young boy in Victorian England, Wodehouse was taken on social calls with his aunts to great houses and often had tea in the Servants&#x27; Hall, where he learned about the servants&#x27; hierarchy and etiquette. These observations were incorporated into &quot;Something Fresh&quot;. Before Wodehouse wrote the novel, his uncle Walter Meredith Deane and later his eldest brother Philip Peveril had served as second-in-command of the Hong Kong police force, like George Emerson in the novel.

==Publication history==

Wodehouse converted pounds sterling into dollars in the story for the American readers of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; when it was first serialised between 26 June and 14 August 1915. The title &quot;Something New&quot; was used in America instead of &quot;Something Fresh&quot; because &quot;fresh&quot; has a meaning synonymous with &quot;impertinent&quot; in America. For it Wodehouse received a fee of $3,500, more than for any previous work. The serial in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; included illustrations by F. R. Gruger.

The book is described, in a new preface added in 1969, as the start of &quot;the Blandings Castle Saga&quot;. Into this scenario many new elements were to be introduced over the years, but there was also one notable omission. This was Lord Emsworth&#x27;s sister Lady Ann Warblington, who is mentioned in &quot;Something Fresh&quot; as subject to headaches and largely confined to her room, never to reappear in a Blandings novel again.

&quot;Something Fresh&quot; was published in the 1979 collection of Blandings novels &quot;Life at Blandings&quot;, along with &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; and &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The story was adapted in 2009 by Archie Scottney as a radio drama for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Classic Serial series. The cast included Ian Ogilvy as the narrator (credited as playing the role of &quot;Wodehouse&quot;), Ioan Gruffudd as Ashe Marson, Helen McCrory as Joan Valentine, Martin Jarvis as Lord Emsworth, Hector Elizondo as J. Preston Peters, Andrea Bowen as Aline Peters, and James Frain as George Emerson.

<text>Schlenkerla is a historic brewpub in Bamberg, Franconia, Germany, renowned for its smoked Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier.

==Beers==
Aecht Schlenkerla is recognized for making traditional Rauchbier (smoked beer) including urbock, märzen, weizen, oak doppelbock, lentbeer (Fastenbier), a Helles Marzen blend (Krausen), Helles (filtered and unfiltered) and Hansla (low alcohol). The brewery releases vintages of the Doppelbock and Urbock that have been aged in rock cellars. A schnapps made from Rauchbier is also available in Schlenkerla&#x27;s pub and restaurant. 

The brewery&#x27;s restaurant has been ranked among the top places in the world to have a beer by All About Beer magazine.

==The pub==
The brewery has been in operation since 1405, when it was a pub known as Zum Blauen Löwen (&quot;At the Blue Lion&quot;). Schlenkerla tavern features a Gothic ceiling known as the &quot;Dominikanerklause&quot;. It is located in the old town section of Bamberg, a UNESCO World Heritage site tucked away in the Franconia section of northern Bavaria. Each year the brewery celebrates &quot;Smokebeer Preservation Day&quot; on July 23. On that day in 1635 the first smoke free malt drying machine was patented. Soon most beers became smoke-free and Rauchbier became rare. Only a small number of Bamberg breweries continued the use of traditional fire kiln malt drying, preserving the style. The style is now made by a limited number of breweries around the world and is recognized at the Great American Beer Festival with a Smoke Beer category with six subcategories.

==Name==
Schlenkerla roughly translates as &quot;Dangling&quot;. &quot;Schlenkern&quot; is a German verb meaning &quot;to swing&quot; or &quot;to dangle&quot; (literally &quot;to slink&quot;). The &quot;-la&quot; suffix is typical of the East Franconian dialect. The name reportedly comes from a brewer with a hobbling gait whose image can be seen on the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier bottle. The brewery&#x27;s legal name is HellerBräu Trum KG, after the Trum family that has owned and run it for six generations.

<doc id="526290" wikidata="Q61266" url="?curid=526290" title="Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz">
<text>Johann Friedrich Gustav von Eschscholtz (1 November 1793 – 7 May 1831) was a Baltic German physician, naturalist, and entomologist. He was one of the earliest scientific explorers of the Pacific region, making significant collections of flora and fauna in Alaska, California, and Hawaii.

==Biography==
Eschscholtz was born in the Livonian city of Dorpat, then part of the Russian Empire. His parents, Johann Gottfried and Katherine Hedwig Ziegler Eschscholtz were ethnic Baltic Germans. He studied medicine and zoology at the University of Dorpat and served as an assistant to Carl Friedrich von Ledebour, a professor of botany. Eschscholtz received a medical degree in 1815.

===First voyage===
On the recommendation of Ledebour, Eschscholtz served as surgeon and naturalist on the Russian expeditionary ship &quot;Rurik&quot; under the command of Otto von Kotzebue. From 1815 to 1818 the expedition circumnavigated the globe for the purposes of seeking a Northwest Passage and exploring the lands bordering the Pacific Ocean. In addition to Eschscholtz, the scientific team included botanist Adelbert von Chamisso and artist Louis Choris.

The expedition left Kronstadt, Russia, on 30 June 1815, stopping at the Canary Islands in September and then crossing the Atlantic to Santa Catarina, Brazil. They passed Cape Horn in January 1816 and sailed north for several months to reach Kamchatka in July. From there they spent the rest of 1816 visiting the Aleutian Islands, California, and Hawaii. At each stop Eschscholtz collected specimens and recorded his observations of the local flora and fauna. Eschscholtz and Chamisso worked well together and became good friends. When Kotzebue became ill in 1817, they cut short a planned return to the Arctic and headed home, stopping again in Hawaii and then in the Philippines before ending their voyage at St. Petersburg in August 1818.

Kotzebue published a three-volume account of the expedition, including reports from Chamisso and Eschscholtz. Their natural history collections were described in the journals &quot;Horae physicae Berolinenses&quot; (1820), the &quot;Memoires de l&#x27;Academie Imperiale des Sciences de St. Petersbourg&quot; (1826) and &quot;Linnaea&quot; (between 1826 and 1836). Eschscholtz&#x27;s botanical collections from California were published under the title &quot;Descriptiones plantarum novae Californiae, adjectis florum exoticorum analysibus&quot; (1826). This was the first scientific description of California&#x27;s flora and the first reference to California in the title of a scientific paper. He also published some of his entomological finds in &quot;Entomographien&quot; (1822).

After his first voyage, Eschscholtz married Christine Friedrike Ledebour and became an assistant professor at the University of Dorpat in 1819. He was later appointed director of the university&#x27;s zoological museum in 1822.

===Second voyage===

In 1823, Kotzebue was commissioned to return to the North Pacific to resupply Kamchatka and then proceed to Alaska to protect the Russian American Company from smugglers. Eschscholtz accepted an offer to participate in this second voyage and left Kronstadt on 28 July 1823 aboard the &quot;Predpriaetie&quot; (&quot;Enterprise&quot;). Again Eschscholtz amassed significant collections of natural history specimens, especially insects. Substantial insect collections were made in Hawaii, Alaska, and California. After a voyage of three years, the expedition returned home in July 1826.

In 1830, Kotzebue and Eschscholtz published a report of their voyage titled &quot;A new voyage round the world in the years 1823, 24, 25, and 26&quot;. Eschscholtz published illustrated descriptions of the new fauna he encountered in &quot;Zoologischer Atlas&quot;, 1829-1833; and provided further information in &quot;System der Akalephen&quot;, 1829. He also continued to work at the University of Dorpat, serving as professor of medicine and zoology and director of the zoological museum.
Of the many insects he collected, about 100 butterflies and twenty beetles were species new to science. Eschscholtz described some of them before his death but many were described by others, including Swedish naturalist Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, French entomologist Pierre François Marie Auguste Dejean, and Russian entomologist Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim.

Eschscholtz died on 7 May 1831 in Dorpat, Estonia at the age of 37.

==Legacy==
His friend and colleague, Adelbert von Chamisso, named the California poppy (&quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;) in his honor. Kotzebue named an island in the Marshall Islands as Eschscholtz Atoll. This was renamed in 1946 to Bikini Atoll. Kotzebue also named a small bay east of Kotzebue Sound, Alaska after Eschscholtz.

Most of his collections were left to the University of Dorpat Museum and the Imperial Museum of Moscow.

<doc id="526293" wikidata="Q1336231" url="?curid=526293" title="Effective interest rate">
<text>The effective interest rate (EIR), effective annual interest rate, annual equivalent rate (AER) or simply effective rate is the percentage of interest on a loan or financial product if compound interest accumulates in periods different than a year. It is the compound interest payable annually in arrears, based on the nominal interest rate. It is used to compare the interest rates between loans with different compounding periods. In a situation where a 10% interest rate is compounded annually, its effective interest rate would also be 10%.

==Calculation==
The effective interest rate is calculated as if compounded annually. The effective rate is calculated in the following way, where &quot;r&quot; is the effective annual rate, &quot;i&quot; the nominal rate, and &quot;n&quot; the number of compounding periods per year (for example, 12 for monthly compounding):
:formula_1

For example, a nominal interest rate of 6% compounded monthly is equivalent to an effective interest rate of 6.17%. 6% compounded monthly is credited as 6%/12 = 0.005 every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1 + 0.005)12 ≈ 1.0617. Note that the yield increases with the frequency of compounding.

When the frequency of compounding is increased up to infinity (as for many processes in nature) the calculation simplifies to:
:formula_2
where formula_3 is Euler&#x27;s mathematical constant.

== Comparison with APR ==
The primary difference between annual percentage rate (APR) and effective interest rate, is that the effective interest rate includes the compounding effect, while APR assumes the payee has paid off all interest on a loan each month. Additionally, the APR method, depending on legal jurisdiction, reflects other factors that may effect the cost of a loan such as including fees that may be charged as a part of a loan. Effective interest is the standard in the European Union and many other countries, while APR is often used in the United States.

==Comparison with APY==
Annual percentage yield or effective annual yield is the analogous concept for savings or investments, such as a certificate of deposit. Since a loan by a borrower is an investment for the lender, both terms can apply to the same transaction, depending on the point of view. For a zero-coupon bond such as a US treasury bill, an annual effective discount rate may be specified instead of an effective interest rate, because zero coupon bonds trade at a discount from their face values.

==Effective interest rate (accountancy)==
In accountancy, the term effective interest rate is used to describe the rate used to calculate interest expense or income under the effective interest method. This is not the same as the effective annual rate, and is usually stated as an APR rate.

<doc id="526300" wikidata="Q3809292" url="?curid=526300" title="John Gates">
<text>John &quot;Johnny&quot; Gates, born Solomon Regenstreif (28 September 1913 – 23 May 1992) was an American communist businessman, best remembered as one of the individuals spearheading a failed attempt at liberalization of the Communist Party USA in 1957.

==Background==
Solomon Regenstreif, better known by the Anglo-Saxon name he later adopted, John Gates, was born in 1913 in New York City, the son of ethnic Jewish parents who hailed from Poland.

==Career==
Active in the campaign to free the Scottsboro Boys, Gates left college prior to graduation so that he could pursue his radical political activism. Gates first worked with unemployed workers in Ohio, eventually running unsuccessfully for the city council of Youngstown.

===Spanish Civil War veteran===
When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Gates joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and fought in Spain. In March 1938, at the age of 24, Gates rose to the rank of battalion political commissar of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. In this capacity, Gates gained a reputation as a strict disciplinarian. He later admitted he had gone somewhat overboard. In 1938, he was involved in the controversial decision to execute a deserter named Paul White who had left the lines before having a change of heart and returning, only to be executed for disciplinary reasons. The decision caused great dissension in the Lincoln Brigade&#x27;s ranks, forcing the immediate declaration that no further executions would take place.

===Political career===
Returning to the United States from Spain, Gates became the head of the Young Communist League.

The week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Gates enlisted in the American armed forces.

In the summer of 1948, Gates was one of 12 &quot;kingpin Commies&quot; (to borrow a colorful contemporary turn of phrase from &quot;Time&quot; magazine) indicted under the Smith Act for being &quot;dedicated to the Marxist–Leninist principles of the overthrow and destruction of the Government ... by force and violence.&quot; Although the Smith Act had been implemented eight years earlier at the time of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact for the altogether different purpose of fighting potential infiltration of America by secret Nazi and communist saboteurs, at the height of the Cold War the existing law was used as a tool against national officials of the Communist Party. Prosecution of the ailing 67-year-old William Z. Foster was eventually dropped, but Gates and ten others were convicted in 1949 and sentenced to five years in prison.

Following his release from prison in 1955, Gates was appointed as editor of the Communist Party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;. In that capacity, Gates&#x27; editorial policy soon came to set him at odds with the party leadership, he took liberal positions embracing Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s criticisms of Joseph Stalin and opposing the Soviet Union&#x27;s suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Party leaders were particularly upset by his support of Howard Fast, a prominent writer who was quite critical of the Soviet Union and soon after also left the Communist Party.

However, &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; was in deep trouble with significant losses in circulation due to a general disenchantment with communism, by both workers and intellectuals, and pressure from McCarthyism. Confronted with deep deficits and its inability to control Gates, on December 22, 1957, the Party suspended publication of the paper as a daily, the last daily issue appearing January 13, 1958.

===Resignation===
Gates resigned from the Party in January 1958, claiming that it had &quot;ceased to be an effective force for democracy, peace, and socialism in the United States.&quot; He set to work writing his memoirs, &quot;The Story of an American Communist&quot;, tapping fellow ex-communist pariah Earl Browder to write the book&#x27;s introduction.

In a January 18, 1958, television interview with Mike Wallace, Gates attempted to illuminate his interlocutor on the nature of the power relationship between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the American communist movement: 

 Gates cited the American Communist Party&#x27;s failure to declare its independence from Moscow as decisive in his decision to leave the organization.

Following publication of his memoirs, Gates went to work as a senior research assistant for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). In this capacity, Gates helped members with workers&#x27; compensation, unemployment, and Social Security claims. He retired from the union in 1987.

==Death==
Johnny Gates died on May 23, 1992, in Miami Beach, Florida, at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Lillian Schwartz; a brother, Nat Regenstreif, of Hollywood, Florida, and three sisters, Blanche Smiles of the Bronx, Irene Travis of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Marlene Seml of Boca Raton, Florida.

<text>The Schmidt–Rubin rifles were a series of Swiss Army service rifles in use between 1889 and 1958. They are distinguished by the straight-pull bolt action invented by Rudolf Schmidt and use Eduard Rubin&#x27;s GP90 7.5×53.5 and GP11 7.5×55 Schmidt–Rubin rifle cartridge.

==Models==
===Schmidt–Rubin 1889===
The Model 1889 was the first in the series of Schmidt–Rubin rifles that served Switzerland from 1889 to 1958. The rifle takes its name from the designer of its action, Colonel Rudolf Schmidt, and the designer of its ammunition, Colonel Eduard Rubin. Production of the rifle began in 1891. The straight-pull bolt action allows the user to pull the bolt straight back to unlock the action, cock the striker, extract, and eject the spent cartridge in one motion, and then push the bolt forward to chamber a round and lock the action. This is as opposed to a traditional bolt action, which requires the user to lift the bolt handle to unlock the action before pulling the bolt back. The rifle is roughly musket length with a free-floating barrel, 12-round magazine, and wood stock that extends almost to the tip of the barrel. The Schmidt–Rubin 1889 was an advanced weapon for its time, and one of the first rifles to use copper-jacketed ammunition as its standard ammunition. Most of the bullets used in Europe at the time, except for the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle metal-jacketed 8mm bullet, were around .45 caliber, as opposed to the revolutionary .308 caliber of the GP11 7.5×53.5mm round designed by Col. Rubin in 1882. The round was &quot;paper patched&quot;: the bullet was surrounded by a piece of paper, covering the exposed lead shank of the bullet while a steel cap covered the nose of the bullet. The paper patch helped prevent lead fouling of the bore. In 1923, long after the discontinuation of the Model 1889, the GP11/23 7.5×54.5mm round was produced without the paper patching instead using a full jacket around the bullet. The Model 1889 was eventually replaced by its successor models, including the Model 1896, Model 96/11, Model 1911, Model 1911 carbine.

===Schmidt-Rubin model 1889/96===
The Schmidt–Rubin Model 1889/96 was the replacement for the 1889. The biggest change was moving the locking lugs from the rear to the front of the bolt sleeve, allowing the receiver to be slightly shortened. The change also allowed the bolt and receiver to handle more pressure. Colonel Schmidt was asked to do this for the model 1889, but refused, saying that it was not possible. Colonel Vogelsgang and his assistant Rebholz worked out the details, which were not complex but required time to retool. The rifle system was adopted in 1896. When the cartridge was modified in 1911 to increase the velocity of the bullet, the 1896 bolt system was used. Almost all the model 89/96 rifles were converted to 96/11; only a few remain in the original configuration, most of them private series rifles rather than military issue.

===Schmidt-Rubin Model 1897 cadet rifle===
The Schmidt–Rubin Model 1897 cadet rifle was intended as a replacement for the earlier Vetterli rifles. The Model 97 rifles were single-shot, using the bolt mechanism of the Schmidt–Rubin Model 89/96 rifle. It was to use a reduced-power GP90 7.5×53.5mm cartridge, for cadets. The rifles&#x27; sights were graduated both for the light and the standard loads. Approximately 7,900 cadet rifles were made.

===Model 1899/1900 short rifle===
The model 1899/1900 short rifle was an answer to a call for a short rifle that would replace the unpopular Model 1893 Mannlicher straight pull action carbine. The 99/00 short rifle was meant to be used by artillery and other rear-echelon troops. Design began in February 1900, and production began in 1901 and lasted for 10 years (18,750 were made). It was issued to fortress troops, artillerymen, bicycle troops, and balloon companies. The model 99/00 short rifle can be fitted with Model 1889/92 bayonet and the Model 1906 bayonet. Most of the 99/00 and later 1905 short rifles were converted to model K11 carbines when the GP11 cartridge was adopted; very few unconverted rifles remain.

===Schmidt-Rubin 1896/11 rifle===
The Schmidt–Rubin 1896/11 rifle, or the Model 96/11, was a Swiss upgrade to the 89/96 rifles they had, to use the more powerful cartridge adopted as the GP11. The GP11 cartridge operated at a higher chamber pressure, which the 89/96 action could easily handle. The model 89/96 rifles were modernized by changing the three-groove rifled barrel to a new 4-groove type, adding a pistol grip to the stock, changing the magazine to the 6-round type used in the 1900 short rifle, and modernizing the sights. This also streamlined the appearance of the rifles. Because more rifles were needed than were available, the model 1911 rifle, with slight changes, was put into production. Almost all of the 127,000-plus model 89/96 rifles were converted to the 96/11 specifications.

===Model 1911 rifle===
An improvement over the original 1889 version of the Schmidt–Rubin rifle, the Swiss M1911 placed the locking lugs in the middle of the bolt, rather than at the rear, strengthening the action and allowing a more powerful cartridge, the Gewehrpatrone 11 or GP 11 to be used. It is distinguished from the 96/11 rifle by a curved buttplate and by a stock with an integral semi-pistol grip. It uses a graduated tangent sight which begins at 300 meters. The 1911 and 96/11 rifles were made with excellent craftsmanship, and were exceptionally accurate. As Switzerland remained neutral through both world wars, remaining rifles are typically in far better condition than other European rifles of the time.

===Model 1911 carbine (&quot;K11&quot;) ===
Support troops, cavalry, and certain other units required a shorter rifle, so the Swiss designed the Model 1911 carbine, smaller and lighter than the rifle, and still very accurate. It became a favorite of the Swiss Army, and its popularity contributed to the design of its successor the K31. Production of the K11 carbine included conversion of the model 1900 and 1905 short rifles to the newer specifications; the earlier short rifles are rarely found in their original state. The K11 rifle and carbine were the last of the Vogelsgang/Rebholz weapons produced.

===Other models===
Other models include:

* K31 carbine, a significant later development which was still a straight pull action but much different and improved over the older Schmidt design. Adolf Furrer designed the K31 action.
* Model 1905 carbine
* ZfK31/42 and /43
*Z fK55 sniper rifle

<text>Edmund or Etmond mac Maíl Coluim (c. 1070 – after 1097) was a son of Malcolm III of Scotland and his second wife, Margaret of Wessex. He may be found on some lists of Scottish kings, but there is no evidence that he was king. Although Edmund was probably Malcolm and Margaret&#x27;s second son, he was passed over in subsequent successions as a result of betraying his siblings by siding with their uncle, Donald III.

On the death of Edmund&#x27;s father and his heir-designate Edward, Malcolm&#x27;s eldest son by Margaret, in November 1093, Edmund&#x27;s uncle Donald took the throne. Edmund and his younger brothers Edgar, Alexander and David fled abroad, to England, to join their half-brother Duncan at the court of William Rufus.

In 1094 Duncan, with Rufus&#x27;s blessing and the support of landless nobles from the English court and landowners in Lothian, drove Donald from the throne. It is supposed that Edmund, as the next in age, was Duncan&#x27;s heir-designate. Duncan was forced by a rebellion to send his English allies home, and was shortly afterwards killed. The killer was Máel Petair, Mormaer of Mearns, but the Annals of Ulster and William of Malmesbury agree that the killing was done on the orders of Donald and Edmund.

What caused Edmund to join with his uncle is unknown. It is assumed that Donald appointed him his heir as Donald had no sons of his own, and it is thought that Edmund was granted an appanage to rule.

Edmund&#x27;s maternal uncle Edgar Ætheling came north in 1097, driving Donald from the throne and installing Edmund&#x27;s younger brother Edgar as king, with Alexander as his heir-designate. While Donald was mutilated and imprisoned, dying in 1099, Edmund was more fortunate. He was tonsured and sent to the Cluniac monastery at Montacute in Somerset. The exact date of his death is unknown.

<text>Alice Stokes Paul (January 11, 1885 – July 9, 1977) was an American Quaker, suffragette, suffragist, feminist, and women&#x27;s rights activist, and one of the foremost leaders and strategists of the campaign for the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits sex discrimination in the right to vote. Paul initiated, and along with Lucy Burns and others, strategized events such as the Woman Suffrage Procession and the Silent Sentinels, which were part of the successful campaign that resulted in the amendment&#x27;s passage in August 1920.

Paul often suffered police brutality and other physical abuse for her activism, always responding with nonviolence and courage. She was jailed under terrible conditions in 1917 for participating in a Silent Sentinels protest in front of the White House, as she had been several times during earlier efforts to secure the vote for women in the United Kingdom.

After 1920, Paul spent a half-century as leader of the National Woman&#x27;s Party, which fought for the Equal Rights Amendment, written by Paul and Crystal Eastman, to secure constitutional equality for women. She won a major permanent success with the inclusion of women as a group protected against discrimination by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

==Early life and education==

Alice Stokes Paul was born on January 11, 1885, to William Mickle Paul I and Tacie &quot;Parry&quot; Paul at Paulsdale in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey. She was a namesake of Alice Stokes, her maternal grandmother and the wife of William Parry. Her siblings were Willam Mickle Paul II, Helen &quot;Paul&quot; Shearer, and Parry Haines Paul. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; Alice Paul first learned about women&#x27;s suffrage from her mother, a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), and would sometimes join her mother in attending suffragist meetings.

Paul attended Moorestown Friends School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1901, she entered Swarthmore College, which had been co-founded in 1864 by her grandfather and other Hicksite Friends. While at Swarthmore, Paul served on the executive board of Student Government, an experience which may have sparked her excitement for political activism. She graduated from Swarthmore with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology in 1905.

After graduation, partly to avoid going into teaching, Paul pursued a fellowship year in New York City, living on the Lower East Side at the Rivington Street Settlement House. Working in the settlement movement reinforced her determination to right perceived injustices in America, but Paul soon realized that social work was not the way she was to achieve this goal: &quot;I knew in a very short time I was never going to be a social worker, because I could see that social workers were not doing much good in the world... you couldn&#x27;t change the situation by social work.&quot;

In 1907, after completing coursework in political science, sociology, and economics, Paul earned a Master of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania. She continued her studies at the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre in Birmingham, England. Paul also took economics classes from the University of Birmingham while continuing to earn money doing social work. It was at Birmingham that she first heard Christabel Pankhurst speak. When Paul later moved to London to study sociology and economics at the London School of Economics, she joined the militant suffrage group the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Christabel and her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst. Paul was arrested repeatedly in London during suffrage demonstrations and served three jail terms. After returning from England in 1910, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in sociology. Her dissertation was entitled &quot;The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania&quot;; it addressed the history of the women&#x27;s movement in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S. and urged woman suffrage as the key issue of the day.

After the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Paul enrolled at two law schools, taking day and evening classes to finish more quickly. In 1922, Paul received her LL.B degree from the Washington College of Law at American University. In 1927, she earned a master of laws degree, and in 1928, a doctorate in civil law from American University.

==Career==
===Britain===
====Early work in British woman suffrage====

In 1907, after completing her master&#x27;s degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Paul moved to England, where she eventually became deeply involved with the British women&#x27;s suffrage movement, regularly participating in demonstrations and marches of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU). After a &quot;conversion experience&quot; seeing Christabel Pankhurst speak at the University of Birmingham, Paul became enamored of the movement. She first became involved by selling a suffragist magazine on street corners. Considering the animosity towards the suffragettes, this was an arduous task and opened her eyes to the abuse women involved in the movement faced. These experiences, combined with the teachings of Professor Beatrice Webb, convinced Paul that social work and charity could not bring about the needed social changes in society: this could only be accomplished through equal legal status for women.

While in London, Paul also met Lucy Burns, a fellow American activist, while arrested in a British police station, who would become an essential ally for the duration of the suffrage fight, first in England, then in the United States. The two women impressed prominent WSPU members and began organizing events and campaign offices. When Emmeline Pankhurst attempted to spread the movement to Scotland, Paul and Burns accompanied her as assistants.

Paul gained the trust of fellow WSPU members through her talent with visual rhetoric and her willingness to put herself in physical danger to increase the visibility of the suffrage movement. While at the WSPU&#x27;s headquarters in Edinburgh, Paul and local suffragettes made plans to protest a speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey. For a week prior, they spoke with people on the streets to promote knowledge about why they were protesting against the Cabinet member. After Grey discussed proposed legislation he claimed would lead to prosperity at the meeting, Paul stood up and exclaimed: &quot;Well, these are very wonderful ideals, but couldn&#x27;t you extend them to women?&quot; Police responded by dragging her out of the meeting and through the streets to the police station, where she was arrested. As planned, this act was viewed by many as a public silencing of legitimate protest and increased press coverage and public sympathy.

Later events involved even more risk of bodily harm. Before a political meeting at St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall in Glasgow in August 1909, Paul camped out on the hall&#x27;s roof so that she could address the crowd below. When police forced her to descend, crowds cheered her effort. Later, when Paul, Burns, and fellow suffragettes attempted to enter the event, they were beaten by police as sympathetic bystanders attempted to protect them. After Paul and her fellow protesters were taken into custody, crowds gathered outside the police station demanding the women&#x27;s release.

On November 9, 1909, in honor of Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day, the Lord Mayor of London hosted a banquet for cabinet ministers in the city&#x27;s Guild Hall. Paul planned the WSPU&#x27;s response; she and Amelia Brown disguised themselves as cleaning women and entered the building with the normal staff at 9:00 am. Once in the building, the women hid until the event started that evening. Then they came out of hiding and &quot;took their stand&quot;. When Prime Minister H. H. Asquith stood to speak, Brown threw her shoe through a pane of stained glass, and both women yelled, &quot;Votes for women!&quot; Following this event, both women were arrested and sentenced to one-month hard labor after refusing to pay fines and damages for the window damage. She was imprisoned at Holloway Prison in London.

==== Civil disobedience and hunger strikes ====
Whilst associated with the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, Paul was arrested a total of seven times and imprisoned three times. It was during her time in prison that she learned the tactics of civil disobedience from Emmeline Pankhurst. Chief among these tactics was demanding to be treated as a political prisoner upon arrest. This not only sent a message about the legitimacy of the suffragists to the public but also had the potential to provide tangible benefits. In many European countries, including England, political prisoners were given a special status: &quot;[T]hey were not searched upon arrest, not housed with the rest of the prisoner population, not required to wear prison garb, and not force-fed if they engaged in hunger strikes.&quot; Though arrested suffragists often were not afforded the status of political prisoners, this form of civil disobedience provided much press for the WSPU. For example, during a London arrest (after being denied political prisoner status), Paul refused to put on prisoner&#x27;s clothing. After the prison matrons could not undress her forcibly, they requested assistance from male guards. This act, considered shockingly improper by Victorian era standards, provided extensive press coverage for the suffrage movement.

Another popular civil disobedience tactic used by the suffragists was hunger striking. The first WSPU-related hunger strike was conducted by sculptor Marion Wallace Dunlop in June 1909. By that fall, it was being widely used by WSPU members because of its effectiveness in publicizing their mistreatment and gaining quick release from prison wardens. Refusing food worked in securing an early release for Paul during her first two arrests. However, during her third prison stint, the warden ordered twice daily force-feeding to keep Paul strong enough to finish her month-long sentence.

Though the prisons staunchly maintained that the force-feeding of prisoners was for their own benefit, Paul and other women described the process as torturous. Paul had developed severe gastritis at the end of her month in prison. She was carried out of prison and immediately tended to by a doctor. However, after this event, her health was permanently scarred; she often developed colds and flu, which would sometimes require hospitalization.

Paul had been given a Hunger Strike Medal &#x27;for Valour&#x27; by WSPU.

=== United States ===
After the ordeal of her final London imprisonment, Paul returned to the United States in January 1910 to continue her recovery and to develop a plan for suffrage work back home. Paul&#x27;s experiences in England were well-publicized, and the American news media quickly began following her actions upon her return home. She drew upon the teachings of Woodbrooke and her religion and quickly decided that she wanted to embrace a single goal as a testimony. The single goal she chose was the recognition of women as equal citizens.

Paul reenrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing her Ph.D. while speaking about her experiences in the British suffrage movement to Quaker audiences and starting to work towards United States suffrage on the local level. After completing her dissertation, a comprehensive overview of the history of the legal status of United States women, she began participating in National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) rallies, and in April 1910, was asked to speak at NAWSA&#x27;s annual convention. After this significant opportunity, Paul and Burns proposed to NAWSA leadership a campaign to gain a federal amendment guaranteeing the vote for women. This was wholly contrary to NAWSA&#x27;s state-by-state strategy. Paul and Burns were laughed at by NAWSA leadership; the only exception was Jane Addams, who suggested that the women tone down their plan. As a response, Paul asked to be placed on the organization&#x27;s Congressional Committee.

==== 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession ====

One of Paul&#x27;s first big projects was initiating and organizing the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, D.C., the day before President Wilson&#x27;s inauguration. Paul was determined to pressure Wilson because the office of the President would be able to influence Congress the most. She assigned volunteers to contact suffragists nationwide and recruit supporters to march in the parade. In a matter of weeks, Paul succeeded in gathering roughly eight thousand marchers representing most of the country. However, she had much more trouble gaining institutional support for the protest parade. Paul insisted the parade route go through Pennsylvania Avenue where President Wilson would be. Her goal was to send the message that the push for women&#x27;s suffrage existed before Wilson and would outlast him if need be. Washington officials originally resisted this route, and according to biographer Christine Lunardini, Paul was the only one who truly believed the parade would take place on that route. Eventually, the city ceded the route to NAWSA. However, the city supervisor claimed that the women would not be safe marching along the Pennsylvania Avenue route and strongly suggested the group move the parade. Paul responded by demanding the city supervisor provide more police, which was not done. On March 3, 1913, the parade gained legitimacy with Congress passing a special resolution ordering the city supervisor to prohibit all ordinary traffic along the parade route and prevent any interference with the suffrage marchers.

On the event day, the procession proceeded along Paul&#x27;s desired route. The event, which was led by notable labor lawyer Inez Milholland dressed in white and riding a horse, was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most impressively beautiful spectacles ever staged in this country&quot;. Multiple bands, banners, squadrons, chariots, and floats were also displayed in the parade representing all women&#x27;s lives. One of the most notable sights was the lead banner in the parade which declared, &quot;We Demand an Amendment to the United States Constitution Enfranchising the Women of the Country.&quot; Some participating groups and leaders, however, wanted black and white women&#x27;s organizations and state delegations to be segregated; after much discussion, NAWSA decided black women could march where they wished. Still, Ida B. Wells was asked not to march with the Illinois delegation; ultimately, she joined the Chicago group and continued the march with the state delegation.

Over half a million people came to view the parade. With insufficient police protection, the situation soon devolved into a near-riot, with onlookers pressing so close to the women that they could not proceed. Police largely did nothing to protect the women from rioters. A senator who participated in the march later testified that he personally took the badge numbers of 22 officers who had stood idle, including two sergeants. Eventually, members of the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania National Guard intervened, and students from the Maryland Agricultural College provided a human barrier to help the women pass. Some accounts even describe Boy Scouts as stepping in and providing first aid to the injured. The incident mobilized public dialogue about the police response to the women&#x27;s demonstration, producing greater awareness and sympathy for NAWSA.

After the parade, the NAWSA&#x27;s next focus was lobbying for a constitutional amendment to secure the right to vote for women. Such an amendment had been initially sought by suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton who, as leaders of the NWSA, fought for a federal amendment to the constitution securing women&#x27;s suffrage until the 1890 formation of NAWSA, which campaigned for the vote on a state-by-state basis.

====National Woman&#x27;s Party====

Paul&#x27;s militant methods started to create tension between her and the leaders of NAWSA, who thought she was moving too aggressively in Washington. Eventually, disagreements about strategy and tactics led to a break with NAWSA. Paul formed the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage and, later the National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP) in 1916.

The NWP began introducing some of the methods used by the suffrage movement in Britain such as silent sentinels and focused entirely on achieving a constitutional amendment for woman suffrage. Alva Belmont, a multi-millionaire socialite at the time, was the largest donor to Paul&#x27;s efforts. The NWP was accompanied by press coverage and the publication of the weekly newspaper, &quot;The Suffragist&quot;.

====Silent Sentinels====

In the U.S. presidential election of 1916, Paul and the National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP) campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent Democrats to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. Paul went to Mabel Vernon to help her organize a picketing campaign. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and picketing at the White House. Picketing had been legalized by the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act, so the women were not doing anything illegal. The pickets, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign known as the &quot;Silent Sentinels&quot;, dressed in white, silent and with 2,000 taking part over two years, maintained a presence six days a week, holding banners demanding the right to vote. Paul knew the only way they could accomplish their goal was by displaying the President&#x27;s attitude toward suffrage, so picketing would achieve this in the best manner. Each day Paul would issue &quot;General Orders&quot;, selecting women to be in charge and who would speak for the day. She was the &quot;Commandant&quot;, and Mabel Vernon was the &quot;Officer of the Day&quot;. Paul created state days to get volunteers for the pickets, such as Pennsylvania Day, Maryland Day, and Virginia Day. She also made special days for professional women, such as doctors, nurses, and lawyers.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. Paul made sure the picketing would continue. In June 1917, picketers were arrested for &quot;obstructing traffic&quot;. Over the next six months, many, including Paul, were convicted and incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail.

When the public heard the news of the first arrests, some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. For example, the &quot;Boston Journal&quot; stated, &quot;The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers, and sailors until its efforts to attract the President&#x27;s attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation.&quot;

Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as &quot;Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?&quot; and &quot;We Shall Fight for the Things Which We Have Always Held Nearest Our Hearts—For Democracy, For The Right of Those Who Submit To Authority To Have A Voice in Their Own Governments.&quot; The capitalization of each word emphasized the gravity of the situation. With the hope of embarrassing Wilson, some of the banners quoted Wilson&#x27;s own words against him. Wilson ignored these women, but his daughter Margaret waved in acknowledgment, a major victory for the protesters. Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed. While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters. Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten. Even though they protested during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. More protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail throughout this time. Pardons were no longer given.

===Prison, hunger strikes, and passage of Nineteenth Amendment===

In solidarity with other activists in her organization, Paul purposefully strove to receive the seven-month jail sentence that started on October 20, 1917. She began serving her time in the District Jail.

Whether sent to Occoquan or the District Jail, the women were given no special treatment as political prisoners. They had to live in harsh conditions with poor sanitation, infested food, and dreadful facilities. In protest of the conditions at the District Jail, Paul began a hunger strike. This led to her being moved to the prison&#x27;s psychiatric ward and being force-fed raw eggs through a feeding tube. &quot;Seems almost unthinkable now, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; Paul told an interviewer from &quot;American Heritage&quot; when asked about forced feeding, &quot;It was shocking that a government of men could look with such extreme contempt on a movement that was asking nothing except such a simple little thing as the right to vote.&quot;

On November 14, 1917, the suffragists who were imprisoned at Occoquan endured brutality allegedly endorsed by prison authorities which became known as the &quot;Night of Terror&quot;. The National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP) went to court to protest the treatment of the women such as Lucy Burns, Dora Lewis, and Alice Cosu, her cellmate in Occoquan Prison, who suffered a heart attack at seeing Dora&#x27;s condition. The women were later moved to the District Jail where Paul languished. Despite the brutality that she experienced and witnessed, Paul remained undaunted. On November 27 and 28, all the suffragists were released from prison. Within two months, Wilson announced a bill on women&#x27;s right to vote.

=== Post-Suffrage ===
After Suffrage, the National Women&#x27;s Party (NWP) continued to lobby in Congress and abroad, advocating for legal equality for women. Alice Paul and NWP members successfully lobbied to include equality provisions into the United Nation&#x27;s charter, such as the phrase &quot;the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.&quot; NWP is credited with drafting over 300 pieces of legislation that became law. Paul remained in leadership positions, officially and unofficially, until she moved to Connecticut in 1974.

===Equal Rights Amendment===

Once suffrage was achieved in 1920, Paul and some members of the National Woman&#x27;s Party shifted attention to constitutional guarantees of equality through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which was written by Paul and Crystal Eastman. Drafted and delivered to Congress in 1923, the original text of the Equal Rights Amendment—which Paul and the National Woman&#x27;s Party dubbed the &quot;Lucretia Mott Amendment&quot; in honor of this antislavery and suffrage activist of an earlier generation—read, &quot;Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.&quot; In 1943, the amendment was renamed the &quot;Alice Paul Amendment,&quot; and contained wording was changed to the version that still exists today: &quot;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.&quot; For Paul, the ERA had the same appeal as suffrage in that it was a constitutional amendment and a single-issue campaign that she believed could and should unite women around a common core goal. Paul understood the value of single-issue politics for building coalitions and securing success.

Not everyone agreed about next steps or the ERA; from the start, the amendment had its critics. While Paul&#x27;s activism in the years after suffrage centered on securing legal protections for women&#x27;s equality in the U.S. and abroad, other activists and some members of the NWP focused on a wide range of issues from birth control and air conditioning to educating newly enfranchised women voters. Some of Paul&#x27;s earlier allies in suffrage found the ERA troubling, especially since they believed it would erode protective legislation—laws about working conditions or maximum hours that protected women in the workplace. If the ERA guaranteed equality, opponents argued, protective legislation for women would be null and void. The rival League of Women Voters (LWV), which championed workplace legislation for women, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. Paul and her cohorts, including a small group from the NWP, thought that sex-based workplace legislation restricted women&#x27;s ability to compete for jobs with men and earn good wages. In fact, Paul believed that protective legislation hurt women wage earners because some employers simply fired them rather than implement protections on working conditions that safeguarded women. Women were paid less than men, lost jobs requiring them to work late nights—often a prohibition under protective legislation—and had long been blocked from joining labor unions on par with men. She also believed that women should be treated under the law like men were and not as a class that required protection. To Paul, such protections were merely a form of entrenched &quot;legalized inequality,&quot; a position shared by suffragist Harriot Stanton Blatch. To Paul, the ERA was the most efficient way to ensure legal equality. Paul expected women workers to rally behind the ERA; some did, many did not. While early on, there was hope among NWP members that they could craft a bill that would promote equality while also guaranteeing labor protection for women, to Paul, that was a contradiction. What&#x27;s more, she was surprised when Florence Kelley, Ethel Smith, Jane Addams, and other suffragists parted with her and aligned with protective legislation.

While Paul continued to work with the NWP and even served as president again in the 1940s, she remained steadfastly committed to women&#x27;s equality as her singular mission. Along with the ERA, Paul worked on behalf of similar efforts in state legislation and international contexts. She helped ensure that the United Nations proclamations include equality for women. She hoped that this would encourage the United States to follow suit. Paul worked to change laws that had altered the status of a woman&#x27;s citizenship based on that of her husband&#x27;s. In the U.S., women who married men from foreign countries lost their U.S. citizenship and were considered by the U.S. to be citizens of whatever country their husbands were from. To Paul, this was a violation of equal rights. As such, she successfully worked on behalf of the international Equal Nationality Treaty in 1933 and in the U.S. for the successful passage of the Equal Nationality Act in 1934, which let women retain their citizenship upon marriage. Just after the founding of the United Nations in 1945, Paul wanted to ensure that women&#x27;s equality was a part of the organization&#x27;s charter and that its Commission on Human Rights included a focus on women&#x27;s equality in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She prevailed: the final version of the Declaration in 1948 opened with a reference to &quot;equal rights of men and women&quot;.

The ERA was introduced in Congress in 1923 and had various peaks and valleys of support in the following years as Paul continued to push for its passage. There were favorable committee reports in Congress in the late 1930s, and with more women working in men&#x27;s jobs during the war, public support for the ERA also increased. In 1946, the ERA passed by three votes in the Senate, not the majority needed for it to advance. Four years later, it would garner the Senate votes but fail in the House, thereby halting it from moving forward.

Paul was encouraged when women&#x27;s movement activism gained steam in the 1960s and 1970s, which she hoped would spell victory for the ERA. When the bill finally passed Congress in 1972, Paul was unhappy about the changes in the wording of the ERA that now included time limits for securing its passage. Advocates argued that this compromise—the newly added seven-year deadline for ratification in the states—enabled the ERA&#x27;s passage in Congress, but Paul accurately predicted that the inclusion of a time limit would ensure its defeat. In addition, this version put enforcement power in the hands of the federal government only; Paul&#x27;s original and 1943 reworded versions required both states and the federal government to oversee its provisions. Paul&#x27;s version was politically insightful and strategic: politicians who believed in states&#x27; rights, including many Southern states, were more likely to support an ERA that gave states some discretion of enforcement authority than a version that did not. Paul was proved correct: while the ERA did receive a three-year extension from Congress, it remained three states short of those needed for ratification.

States continued to attempt to ratify the ERA long after the deadline passed, including Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. In 2017 and again in 2019, the Senate and House introduced resolutions to remove the deadline from the ERA. These or similar measures, if passed, according to some experts, would make the amendment viable again, although other experts dispute it.

===1964 Civil Rights Act===
Paul played a significant role in adding protection for women in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the opposition of liberals who feared it would end protective labor laws for women. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. Smith&#x27;s amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. For twenty years, Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment in the House because he believed in equal rights for women, even though he opposed equal rights for blacks. For decades, he had been close to the National Woman&#x27;s Party, especially to Paul. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945, trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category.

=== Views on abortion ===
Alice Paul, like many early feminists and suffragists, was opposed to abortion. Paul was quoted as saying, &quot;Abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Paul had an active social life until she moved to Washington, D.C., in late 1912. She was an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She enjoyed close relationships with women and befriended and occasionally dated men. Paul did not preserve private correspondence for the most part, so few details about her personal life are available. Once Paul devoted herself to winning the vote for women, she placed the suffrage effort first in her life. Nevertheless, Elsie Hill and Dora Kelly Lewis, two women whom she met early in her work for NAWSA, remained close to her all their lives. She knew William Parker, a scholar she met at the University of Pennsylvania, for several years; he may have tendered a marriage proposal in 1917.

Paul became a vegetarian around the time of the suffrage campaign.

In 1974, Paul suffered a stroke and was placed in a nursing home under the guardianship of her nephew, who depleted her estate. News of her penniless state reached friends, and a fund for indigent Quakers quickly aided Paul. Paul died at the age of 92 on July 9, 1977, at the Greenleaf Extension Home a Quaker facility in Moorestown, New Jersey, less than a mile from her birthplace and childhood home. She is buried at Westfield Friends Burial Ground in Cinnaminson, New Jersey. Visitors frequently leave notes at her tombstone to thank her for her lifelong work on behalf of women&#x27;s rights.

==Legacy==

Paul was posthumously inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1979, and into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2010.

Her alma mater, Swarthmore College, named the Alice Paul Women&#x27;s Center in her honor, a name in use from 1975 to the early 1990s. In 2004, Swarthmore opened the Alice Paul Residence Hall. Montclair State University in New Jersey has also named a dormitory (Alice Paul Hall) in her honor. On April 12, 2016, President Barack Obama designated Sewall-Belmont House as the Belmont–Paul Women&#x27;s Equality National Monument, named for Alice Paul and Alva Belmont. The University of Pennsylvania, her doctoral alma mater, maintains the Alice Paul Center for Research on Gender, Sexuality, and Women.

Two countries have honored her by issuing a postage stamp: Great Britain in 1981 and the United States in 1995. The U.S. stamp was the $0.78 Great Americans series.

Paul appeared on a United States half-ounce $10 gold coin in 2012 as part of the First Spouse Gold Coin Series. A provision in the Presidential $1 Coin Program directs that Presidential spouses be honored. As President Chester A. Arthur was a widower, Paul is shown representing &quot;Arthur&#x27;s era&quot;. The U.S. Treasury Department announced in 2016 that an image of Paul will appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession that Paul initiated and organized. 

In 1987, a group of New Jersey women raised the money to purchase Paul&#x27;s papers when they came up for auction so that an archive could be established. Her papers and memorabilia are now held by the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1990, the same group, now the Alice Paul Institute, purchased the brick farmhouse, Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, where Paul was born. Paulsdale is a National Historic Landmark and is on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. The Alice Paul Institute keeps her legacy alive with educational exhibits about her life, accomplishments, and advocacy for gender equality.

Hilary Swank played Paul in the 2004 film &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;, which portrayed the 1910s women&#x27;s suffrage movement for passage of the 19th Amendment. In 2018, Alice Paul was a central character in an episode of &quot;Timeless&quot; (Season 2, Episode 7) which alludes to Paul giving an impassioned speech to President Woodrow Wilson during a march that ends in police violence upon the suffragist marchers. According to history, Paul was at the event and was arrested, but there is no evidence that she spoke to Wilson on that day. In 2022, &quot;Suffs&quot;, a musical written by Shaina Taub, premiered at The Public Theater with Alice Paul as a main character.

On January 11, 2016, Google Doodle commemorated her 131st birthday.

<text>Schroeder is a North German (from Schröder) occupational name for a cloth cutter or tailor, from an agent derivative of Middle Low German , &quot;to cut&quot;. The same term was occasionally used to denote a gristmiller as well as a shoemaker, whose work included cutting leather, and also a drayman, one who delivered beer and wine in bulk to customers; in some instances the surname may have been acquired in either of these senses. This name is widespread throughout central and eastern Europe which has been held by many notable people, including:

<text>John Endecott (also spelled Endicott; 1588 – 15 March 1665), regarded as one of the Fathers of New England, was the longest-serving governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He served a total of 16 years, including most of the last 15 years of his life. When not serving as governor, he was involved in other elected and appointed positions from 1628 to 1665 except for the single year of 1634.

Endecott was a zealous and somewhat hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist attitudes toward the Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony&#x27;s early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short, and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well with those of the Puritans. He notoriously defaced the English flag because he saw Saint George&#x27;s Cross as a symbol of the papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.

Endecott used some of his properties to propagate fruit trees; a pear tree he planted still lives in Danvers, Massachusetts. He also engaged in one of the earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in the colonies when copper ore was found on his land. His name is found on a rock in Lake Winnipesaukee, carved by surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony&#x27;s northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.

==Life==

Little is known of Endecott&#x27;s origins. 19th century biographers believed he hailed from Dorchester, Dorset, due to his significant later association with people from that area. In the early 20th century, historian Roper Lethbridge proposed that Endecott was born circa 1588 in or near Chagford in Devon. In the 16th century the prominent Endecott family, together with the Whiddons, Knapmans and Lethbridges, owned most of the mines around the stannary town of Chagford, which might—if he is indeed from this family—explain his interest in developing copper mining. (Based on this evidence, Chagford now has a house from the period named in Endecott&#x27;s honour.)

However, more recent research by the New England Historic Genealogical Society has identified problems with Lethbridge&#x27;s claims, which they dispute. According to their research, Endecott may have been born in or near Chagford, but there is no firm evidence for this, nor is there evidence that identifies his parents. They conclude, based on available evidence, that he was probably born no later than 1600. A John Endecott was active in Devon early in the 17th century, but there is no firm evidence connecting him to this Endecott.

Very little is known of Endecott&#x27;s life before his association with colonisation efforts in the 1620s. He was known to Sir Edward Coke, and may have come to know Roger Williams through this connection. He was highly literate, and spoke French. Some early colonial documents refer to him as &quot;Captain Endecott&quot;, indicating some military experience, and other records suggest he had some medical training.

===Settlement in the New World===
In March 1627/28, Endecott was one of seven signatories to a land grant given to &quot;The New England Company for a Plantation in Massachusetts&quot; (or the New England Company) by the Earl of Warwick on behalf of the Plymouth Council for New England; the council was at the time the umbrella organisation overseeing English colonisation efforts in North America between 40 and 48 degrees latitude.

Endecott was chosen to lead the first expedition, and sailed for the New World aboard the &quot;Abigail&quot; with fifty or so &quot;planters and servants&quot; on 20 June 1628. The settlement they organized was first called Naumkeag, after the local Indian tribe, but was eventually renamed Salem in 1629. The area was already occupied by settlers of the failed Dorchester Company, some of whose backers also participated in the New England Company. This group of earlier settlers, led by Roger Conant, had migrated from a settlement on Cape Ann (near present-day Gloucester, Massachusetts) after it was abandoned. Endecott was not formally named governor of the new colony until it was issued a royal charter in 1629. At that time, he was appointed governor by the Company&#x27;s council in London, and Matthew Craddock was named the Company&#x27;s governor in London.

Endecott&#x27;s responsibility was to establish the colony and to prepare it for the arrival of additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, and he called on the Plymouth Colony for medical assistance. His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony&#x27;s settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which included a maypole and dancing) were anathema to the conservative Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the abandoned site of Morton&#x27;s colony and had the maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.

===Early 1630s===
Endecott&#x27;s first tenure as governor came to an end in 1630, with the arrival of John Winthrop and the colonial charter. The company had reorganised itself, relocating its seat to the colony itself, with Winthrop as its sole governor. After seeing the conditions at Salem, Winthrop decided to relocate the colony&#x27;s seat at the mouth of the Charles River, where he founded what is now the city of Boston. Endecott, who was chosen as one of the governor&#x27;s Assistants (a precursor to the later notion of a Governor&#x27;s Council), chose to remain in Salem, where he was one of its leading citizens for the rest of his life, serving in roles as town councilor and militia leader, in addition to statewide roles as militia leader, magistrate, deputy governor, and governor. He established a plantation called &quot;Orchard&quot; in Salem Village (now known as Danvers), where he cultivated seedlings of fruit trees. One particular pear tree, brought over as a sapling on one of the early settlement convoys, still lives and bears fruit; it is known as the Endicott Pear Tree.

In the early 1630s the religious conflict between the Nonconformists and the Separatists was the primary source of political disagreement in the colony, and it was embodied by the churches established in Boston and Salem. The Salem church adhered to Separatist teachings, which sought a complete break with the Church of England, while Nonconformist teachings, which were held by Winthrop and most of the colonial leadership in Boston, sought to reform the Anglican church from within.

The arrival in Boston in 1631 of Roger Williams, an avowed Separatist, heightened this conflict. Authorities there banished him, and he first went to Salem, where, due to Endecott&#x27;s intervention, he was offered a position as a teacher in the local church. When word of this reached Boston, Endecott was criticised for supporting Williams, who was banished from the colony. Williams went to Plymouth, but returned to Salem a few years later, becoming the church&#x27;s unofficial pastor following the death of Samuel Skelton in 1634. Boston authorities called for his arrest after he made what they viewed as treasonous and heretical statements; he fled, eventually establishing Providence, Rhode Island.

During this time Endecott argued that women should be veiled in church, and controversially defaced the local militia&#x27;s flag, because it bore St George&#x27;s Cross, which Williams claimed was a symbol of the papacy. This action is celebrated in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s story, &quot;Endicott and the Red Cross&quot;, where the writer presents the &quot;tension between Endecott as a symbol of religious intolerance and as emblem of heroic resistance to foreign domination of New England.&quot; Endecott did this at a time when the Privy Council of King Charles I was examining affairs in Massachusetts, and the colonial administration was concerned that a strong response was needed to prevent the loss of the colonial charter. Endecott was censured for the rashness of his action (and not for the act itself), and deprived of holding any offices for one year; 1635 was the only year in which he held no office. The committee managing the colonial militia voted that year to stop using the English flag as its standard.

Following the incident, and the refusal of the colonial assembly to grant Salem additional land on the Marblehead Neck because of Williams&#x27; presence in Salem, the Salem church circulated a letter to other churches in the colony, calling the legislative act a heinous sin. Although the authorship of the letter is uncertain, Endecott defended the letter when summoned to Boston, and was consequently jailed for a day; after &quot;he came and acknowledged his fault, he was discharged.&quot;

===Pequot War===

In 1636 the boat of Massachusetts trader John Oldham was seen anchored off Block Island, swarming with Indians. The Indians fled at the approach of the investigating colonists, and Oldham&#x27;s body was found below the main deck. The attackers were at the time believed to be from tribes affiliated with the Narragansetts, but Narragansett leaders claimed that those responsible had fled to the protection of the Pequots. At the time the Pequots were aggressively expansionist in their dealings with the surrounding native tribes (including the Narragansett), but had generally kept the peace with the English colonists of present-day southern New England. The accusation of the Narraganssetts angered Massachusetts authorities (then under governor Henry Vane), who were already upset that the Pequots had earlier failed to turn over men implicated in killing another trader on the Connecticut River. This second perceived affront produced calls in Massachusetts for action against the Pequots. In August 1636 Governor Vane placed Endecott at the head of a 90-man force to extract justice from the Pequots.

Endecott&#x27;s instructions were to go to Block Island, where he was to kill all of the Indian men and take captive the women and children. He was then to go to the Pequots on the mainland, where he was to make three demands: first, that the killers of Oldham and the other trader be surrendered; second, that a payment of one thousand fathoms of wampum be made; and third, that some Pequot children be delivered to serve as hostages.

Endecott executed these instructions with zeal. Although most of the Indians on Block Island only briefly opposed the English landing there, he spent two days destroying their villages, crops and canoes; most of the Indians on the island successfully eluded English searches for them. English reports claimed as many as 14 Indians were killed, but the Narragansetts only reported one fatality. Endecott then sailed for Saybrook, an English settlement at the mouth of the Connecticut River. Lion Gardiner, the leader there, angrily informed Endecott when he learned of the mission&#x27;s goals, &quot;You come hither to raise these wasps around my ears, and then you will take wing and flee away.&quot;

After some discussion and delays due to bad weather, Gardiner and a company of his men agreed to accompany the Massachusetts force to raid the Pequot harvest stores. When they arrived at the Pequot village near the mouth of the Thames River, they returned the friendly greetings of the inhabitants with stony silence. Eventually a Pequot sachem rowed out to meet them; the English delivered their demands, threatening war if they did not receive satisfaction. When the sachem left to discuss the matter in the village, Endecott gave a promise to await his return; however, shortly after the sachem left, he began landing his fully armed men on shore. The sachem rushed back, claiming the senior tribal leaders were away on Long Island; Endecott responded that this was a lie, and ordered an attack on the village. Most of the villagers got away, and once again the expedition&#x27;s activity was reduced to destroying the village and seizing its crop stores; Gardiner reported that &quot;[t]he Bay-men killed not a man.&quot; After completing this work, Endecott and the Massachusetts men boarded their boats to return to Boston, leaving Gardiner and his men to finish the removal of the crops. The Pequots regrouped and launched an attack on Gardiner&#x27;s party whose armor protected them from the arrowfire, but their escape was nevertheless difficult.

Historian Alfred Cave describes Endecott&#x27;s actions as a &quot;heavy-handed provocation of an Indian war.&quot; All of the surrounding colonies protested the action, complaining that the lives of their citizens were placed in jeopardy by the raid. Since the Pequots had previously been relatively peaceful with the English, Endecott&#x27;s raid had the effect Gardiner predicted and feared. Communities on the Connecticut River were attacked in April 1637, and Gardiner was virtually besieged in Saybrook by Pequot forces. Endecott had no further role in the war, which ended with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe; their land was divided up by the colonies and their Indian allies in the 1638 Treaty of Hartford, and the surviving tribespeople were distributed among their neighbors. One captive, an enslaved Pequot boy, was sold to Endecott in 1637.

===Later terms as governor===
Endecott was elected deputy governor in 1641 and in this role was one of the signatories to the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, which enumerated a number of individual rights available to all colonists, and presaged the United States Bill of Rights. The next few years were quiet, although rumors of war with the Indians led to the formation in 1643 of the New England Confederation, designed to facilitate united action by the New England colonies against common external threats as well as internal matters such as dealing with escaped slaves and fugitives from justice.

In 1643, Governor Winthrop became embroiled in a controversy over the propriety of taking sides in a power struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out that he should have let the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor&#x27;s election became a referendum on Winthrop&#x27;s policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw the division of the colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor&#x27;s council of assistants.

Fallout from the English Civil War (begun in 1642) also permeated Boston during Endecott&#x27;s tenure. Two ships, one with a Royalist captain, the other with a Parliamentarian captain, arrived in Boston, and the Parliamentarian sought to seize the Royalist ship. After much deliberation, Endecott&#x27;s councils essentially adopted support of the Parliamentarian position, reserving the right to declare independence if the Parliament &quot;should hereafter be a malignant spirit.&quot; The Parliamentarian was permitted to seize the Royalist vessel, and the colony also began seizing Royalist vessels that came into port.

Thomas Dudley was elected governor in 1645, with Winthrop as his deputy. Endecott, as a consolation, was given command of the colonial militia, reporting to the governor. He was also once again made a governor&#x27;s assistant, and was chosen to represent the colony to the confederation in 1646. The threat of Indian conflicts in neighbouring colonies prompted the colony to raise its defensive profile, in which Endecott played a leading role. Winthrop was reelected governor in 1646; after his death in 1649, Endecott succeeded him as governor. By annual re-elections Endecott served nearly continuously until his death in 1664/5; for two periods (1650–1651 and 1654–1655) he was deputy governor.

In 1639 Endecott had been granted several hundred acres of land north of Salem, in what is now Boxford and Topsfield. The tract was not formally laid out until 1659, but as early as 1651 Endecott was granted an additional &quot;three hundred acres of land to tend the furtherance of a copper works&quot; that was adjacent to his land. Endecott hired Richard Leader, an early settler who had done pioneering work at an iron works in nearby Lynn, but the efforts to develop the site for copper processing failed.

A persistent shortage of coinage in all of the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on 27 May 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.

The colony&#x27;s boundaries expanded somewhat during Endecott&#x27;s tenure, mainly in the 1650s. In addition to formally claiming present-day Stonington, Connecticut as spoils from the Pequot War, Endecott sought to establish the colony&#x27;s northern boundary. In 1652 he sent a commission with surveyors to locate the most northerly point on the Merrimack River, since the colonial grant defined its northern border as north of that river. These surveyors were led by Indian guides to the outlet of Lake Winnipesaukee which was claimed by the guides to be the source of the Merrimack. At that location, the party incised an inscription on a rock that survives, and is now located in a small New Hampshire state park. When this survey line was extended eastward, the boundary was determined to fall on the coast at Casco Bay, and the colony thus claimed most of what is now southern Maine and New Hampshire.

One written statement made early in his tenure in May 1649 showed Endecott&#x27;s dislike of a fashionable trend toward long hair: &quot;Forasmuch as the wearing of long haire after the manner of Ruffians and barbarous Indians, hath begun to invade new England contrary to the rule of gods word ... Wee the Magistrates who have subscribed [signed] this paper ... doe declare and manifest our dislike and detestation against the wearing of such long haire.&quot; In 1651 he presided over a legal case in which three people were accused of being Baptists, a practice that had been banned in the colony in 1644. In convicting John Clarke and sentencing him to either pay a fine or be whipped, Endecott, according to Clarke&#x27;s account of the exchange, told Clarke that he &quot;deserved death, and said he would not have such trash brought into his jurisdiction.&quot; Clarke refused to pay the fine; it was paid by friends against his wishes, and he returned to Rhode Island. Of the three men convicted, only Obadiah Holmes was whipped; John Crandall, out on bond, returned to Rhode Island with Clarke.

When Oliver Cromwell consolidated his control over England in the early 1650s, he began a crackdown on religious communities that dissented from his religious views. This notably included Baptists and Quakers, and these groups began their own migration to the North American colonies to escape persecution. Those that first arrived in Boston in 1656 were promptly deported by Endecott&#x27;s deputy, Richard Bellingham, while Endecott was in Salem. More Quakers arrived while Endecott was resident in Boston, and he had them imprisoned pending trial and deportation. He met several times with the Quaker Mary Prince, after receiving an &quot;outrageous letter&quot; from her. The meetings were apparently fruitless, and she and the other Quakers were deported. Following these acts, the members of the New England Confederation all adopted measures for the prompt removal of Quakers from their jurisdictions.

The measures adopted were insufficient to prevent the influx of these perceived undesirables, so harsher measures were enacted. Repeat offenders were to be punished by having ears cut off, and, on the third offense, to have the tongue &quot;bored through with a hot iron&quot;. By 1658 the punishment for the third offense had been raised to death, &quot;except they do then and there plainly and publicly renounce their said cursed opinions and devilish tenets.&quot; In October 1658 the death penalty was enacted for the second offense in Massachusetts. One year later, three Quakers were arrested and sentenced to death under this law. Two of them, Marmaduke Stephenson and William Robinson, were hanged, while the third, Mary Dyer, received a reprieve at the last minute. Dyer returned to the colony in 1660, and, under questioning by Endecott and the other magistrates, refused to either recant her beliefs or agree to permanent banishment from the colony. She was hanged on 1 June 1660; she, Stephenson, Robinson, and William Leddra (hanged in 1661) are now known as the Boston martyrs. The severity of these acts was recognized by the colonists as problematic, and the laws were changed so that execution was the penalty for the fifth offense. (The poor treatment of Quakers and other religious dissenters would be cited as one of the reasons for revocation of the colonial charter in 1684.)

Endecott&#x27;s role in the treatment of the Quakers was immortalized by John Greenleaf Whittier in his poem &quot;The Ballad of Cassandra Southwick,&quot; named for another Quaker who suffered persecution along with husband Lawrence and at least three of her six children, daughter Provided and sons Daniel and Josiah, while Endecott was governor. Whittier characterized Endecott as &quot;dark and haughty&quot;, and exhibiting &quot;bitter hate and scorn&quot; for the Quaker. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recreated the trial of Wenlock Christison in &quot;John Endicott&quot;, one of three dramatic poems in a collection called &quot;New England Tragedies&quot;. Christison was the last Quaker Endecott sentenced to death for returning to Massachusetts after having been banished. He was not executed, however, because the law was changed shortly after his sentencing. Author Nathaniel Hawthorne described Endecott in &quot;The Gentle Boy&quot;, whose title character is the six-year-old son of William and Mary Dyer, as &quot;a man of narrow mind and imperfect education, and his uncompromising bigotry was made hot and mischievous by violent and hasty passions; he exerted his influence indecorously and unjustifiably to compass the death of the enthusiasts [i.e., the Quakers]; and his whole contact, in respect to them, was marked by brutal cruelty.&quot;

Even though the Puritan colonists of New England were supportive of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s reign in England, they were not always receptive to Cromwell&#x27;s suggestions. In response to a proposal by Cromwell that New Englanders migrate to Ireland to increase its Protestant population, the Massachusetts assembly drafted a polite response, signed by Endecott, indicating that its people were happy where they were.

===English Restoration===

In July 1660 word arrived in Boston that Charles II had been restored to the English throne. This was an immediate cause for concern in all of the colonies that had supported Cromwell, since their charters might be revoked. In Boston it created a more difficult problem for Edward Whalley and William Goffe, two of the &quot;regicide&quot; commissioners who had voted to execute Charles I. Although Charles promised in the 1660 Declaration of Breda that all were pardoned except by act of Parliament, the Indemnity and Oblivion Act 1660 singled out all of the regicides for punishment. Whalley and Goffe moved freely about the Boston area for some time, and Endecott refused to order their arrest until word arrived of the passage of the Indemnity Act. Endecott then issued a warrant for their arrest on 8 March 1661. It is unknown whether Whalley and Goffe had advance warning of the warrant, but they fled, apparently to the New Haven area.
Endecott&#x27;s warrant was followed by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship them back to England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, their search came up empty, and Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different men for the search had he been serious about catching them.

Opponents to the rule of the Puritans in Massachusetts were vocal in airing their complaints to the new king. Among their complaints was the fact that Charles&#x27; ascension to power had not been formally announced; this only took place in 1661 after Endecott received a chastising order from the king. This prompted the assembly to draft another of several laudatory letters it addressed to the king, congratulating him on his rise to power. The mint was claimed to be a bald-faced attempt to devalue good English currency, some colonists complained that the expansion of the colony&#x27;s borders in 1652 was little more than a land grab, while others put forward claims of administrative malfeasance with respect to funds provided by the crown for the Christianization of Indians, and the Quakers catalogued a long list of grievances. Believing that it was best to ignore the accusations, Endecott and other members of the old guard opposed sending representatives to London to argue against these charges. Supporters of the idea raised funds in a private subscription, and sent a commission to London.

The colonial mission, led by future governor Simon Bradstreet and pastor John Norton, was successful, and King Charles announced that he would renew the colonial charter, provided the colony allowed the Church of England to practice there. The Endecott administration dragged its feet on implementation, and after months of inaction, the king sent a commission headed by Samuel Maverick, one of the colony&#x27;s most vocal critics, to investigate. Endecott had advance warning of what the commission was to investigate, and took steps to address in form, if not in substance, some of the expected actions. Charles insisted that all religious dissenters be freed, which Endecott had done long before Maverick&#x27;s arrival, but he did so by deporting them. Upon the commissioners&#x27; arrival, the assembly took up the matter of allowing Church of England activity in the colony. They passed a law deliberately using the king&#x27;s language, allowing anyone &quot;orthodox in religion&quot; to practice in the colony; however, they also defined such orthodoxy as consisting of views that were acceptable to local ministers. This effectively negated the law, because there were probably no ministers in the colony who would agree that Anglicans satisfied their idea of orthodoxy.

===Last years===
In 1655 the Massachusetts assembly passed a law requiring its governor to live closer to Boston; this was probably done in response to Endecott&#x27;s sixth consecutive election as governor. Endecott was consequently obliged to acquire a residence in Boston; although he returned to Salem frequently, Boston became his home for the rest of his life. Endecott died in Boston on 15 March 1664/5. Although early accounts claim he was buried at Boston&#x27;s King&#x27;s Chapel, later evidence has identified his burial site as tomb 189 in the Granary Burying Ground.

==Family==

Before he came to the colonies in 1628, Endecott was married to his first wife, Anne Gourer, who was a cousin of Governor Matthew Craddock. After her death in New England, he was married in 1630 to a woman whose last name was Gibson, and by 1640 he was married to Elizabeth, the daughter of Philobert Cogan of Somersetshire. It is uncertain whether these represent two different wives, or a single wife whose name was Elizabeth (Cogan) Gibson. Due to this uncertainty concerning his wives, it is not known who the mother of his two sons was. There is only firm evidence that he was already married to Elizabeth in 1640, and the records that survive for the 1630s, when his sons were born, do not otherwise identify his wife by name. Endecott&#x27;s last wife, Elizabeth, was a sister-in-law of the colonial financier and magistrate Roger Ludlow. Endecott&#x27;s two known children were John Endecott and Dr. Zerubabbel Endecott, neither of whom, seemingly to his disappointment, followed him into public service. There is also evidence that Endecott fathered another child in his early years in England; in about 1635 he arranged funds and instructions for the care of a minor also named John Endecott.

Despite his high position, Endecott was never particularly affluent. According to his will, several large tracts of land, including the Orchard estate in Salem and one quarter of Block Island, were distributed to his wife and sons; however, it was also noted that some of his books were sold to pay debts. One unexpected legacy left behind by Endecott was the uncertain boundaries of the Orchard estate. Several generations later, his descendants were involved in litigation concerning disputed occupancy of part of the estate.

Endecott&#x27;s descendants include Massachusetts governor Endicott Peabody and United States Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott. His descendants donated family records dating as far back as the colonial era to the Massachusetts Historical Society.

In 1930, the Massachusetts tercentenary was marked by the issuance of a medal bearing Endecott&#x27;s likeness; it was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser. Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts (once a part of Salem) is named for him.

== Namesakes ==
In 1831, the brig &quot;Governor Endicott&quot;, of Salem, H. H. Jenks, master, was engaged in the pepper trade on the coast of Sumatra when she had occasion to help free &quot;Friendship&quot;, also of Salem, Charles Endicott, master, from Malay pirates. He and some of his officers had gone ashore to negotiate for pepper in the town of Quallah Battoo when pirates took over the ship, murdered some of her crew and looted the cargo. Captain Endicott obtained aid from &quot;Governor Endicott&quot; and the ship &quot;James Monroe&quot;, of New York, J. Porter, master, to rescue his ship from her captors and return her to Salem, where he arrived 16 July 1831.

<text>Béla Balázs (; 4 August 1884 – 17 May 1949), born Herbert Béla Bauer, was a Hungarian film critic, aesthetician, writer and poet of Jewish heritage. He was a proponent of formalist film theory.

==Career==
Balázs was the son of Simon Bauer and Eugénia Léwy, adopting his &quot;nom de plume&quot; in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium. He was the brother of the biologist Ervin Bauer.

Balázs was a moving force in the Sonntagskreis or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, Arnold Hauser, György Lukács and Károly (Karl) Mannheim. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.

He is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; which he originally wrote for his roommate Zoltán Kodály, who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, Béla Bartók. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet &quot;The Wooden Prince&quot;.

The collapse of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic under Béla Kun in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union. In 1922, Balázs published &quot;Mantel der Träume&quot; (translated and published in English as &quot;The Cloak of Dreams: Chinese Fairy Tales&quot; in 2010). The book, lauded by Thomas Mann as a &quot;beautiful book,&quot; is a collection of strange, sometimes chilling, fairy tales.

In Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, &quot;Der sichtbare Mensch&quot; (&quot;The Visible Man&quot;) (1924), helped found the German &quot;film as a language&quot; theory, which also exerted an influence on Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for G. W. Pabst&#x27;s film of &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot; (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by Brecht (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.

Later, he co-wrote (with Carl Mayer) and helped Leni Riefenstahl direct the film &quot;Das blaue Licht&quot; (1932). Riefenstahl later removed Balázs&#x27;s and Mayer&#x27;s names from the credits because they were Jewish. One of his best known films is &quot;Somewhere in Europe&quot; (&quot;It Happened in Europe&quot;, 1947), directed by Géza von Radványi.

His last years were marked by increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in Hungary, the Kossuth Prize. Also in 1949, he finished &quot;Theory of the Film&quot;, published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Award was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in cinematography. The following year, the Balázs Béla Studio was also founded.

<doc id="526350" wikidata="Q451294" url="?curid=526350" title="Laramie (TV series)">
<text>Laramie is an American Western television series that aired on NBC from 1959 to 1963. A Revue Studios production, the program originally starred John Smith as Slim Sherman, owner of the Sherman Ranch, along with his younger brother Andy, played by Robert L. Crawford Jr.; Robert Fuller as Jess Harper, an immature, hot-headed drifter who shows up at the Sherman Ranch in the premiere episode; and Hoagy Carmichael as Jonesy, who keeps the homestead/stage stop running while Slim and Jess usually alternate starring roles during the show. Actress Spring Byington was later added to the cast.

==Synopsis==
The two Sherman brothers and a drifter, Jess Harper, come together to run a stagecoach stop for the Great Central Overland Mail Company after the Shermans&#x27; father, Matt, was murdered by a greedy land seeker. The Sherman parents are buried on the ranch. Near the end of the series, Matt Sherman was revealed to have been falsely accused during the American Civil War of having aided the Confederates. After Jess Harper finds on Sherman Ranch land the wreckage of a Union Army gold wagon stolen by Confederate raiders, Slim sets forth with the officer accused of helping the Confederates, portrayed by Frank Overton, and an Army major, the real culprit played by John Hoyt, to clear Matt Sherman&#x27;s name. The gold dust in question had long ago been scattered by the wind.

The series premiere &quot;Stage Stop&quot; (September 15, 1959), which was filmed in color, explains how Slim Sherman and Jess Harper become partners in the Sherman Ranch and Relay Station. Jess arrives in Wyoming from Texas in search of an erstwhile &quot;friend&quot;, Pete Morgan, played by John Mitchum, who had robbed Jess. Morgan is part of the gang of Bud Carlin (Dan Duryea). The gang captures Judge Thomas J. Wilkens (Everett Sloane), to keep him from trying Morgan. Though Jess and Slim are at odds with each other in their first encounters, and friendship seems out of the question, Andy Sherman takes an instant liking to Jess. Andy even asks Jess to take him away from the ranch, where he lives with his older brother Slim. Their first housekeeper is Jonesy, the role filled by Carmichael. Slim and Jess must fight together when Carlin shows up at the relay station (Carlin says he likes to watch men fight), and proceeds to humiliate the judge.

In &quot;The General Must Die&quot; (November 17, 1959), Brian Keith appears as Whit Malone, an old friend of Slim Sherman&#x27;s from the Union Army. Malone and a mentally troubled Colonel Brandon, played by John Hoyt in another appearance on the series, arrive at the relay station with a daring but foiled plan to assassinate General William Tecumseh Sherman, who is scheduled to pass through the station on a stagecoach. Gilman Rankin makes a cameo appearance as General Sherman. This episode reveals that Slim Sherman entered the Army as a private and advanced to second lieutenant and fought under General Sherman (no relation) in the March to the Sea in Georgia.

Subsequent episodes focus on the close friendship that develops between Slim and Jess, as they become like brothers with occasionally strong differences of opinion, but always finding reconciliation and common ground. Generally, Slim, who is taller than Jess and two years older, is depicted as the more level-headed and thoughtful, with Jess as more emotional, with righteous indignation and difficulty controlling his temper.

In the episode &quot;Cactus Lady&quot; (February 21, 1961), it is revealed that Jess Harper had been nearly hanged by mistake in the border city of Laredo, Texas, because of the McCanles gang, played by Arthur Hunnicutt, L. Q. Jones, Harry Dean Stanton, and Anita Sands. The gang arrives suddenly in Laramie.
The German title of &quot;Laramie&quot; is &quot;Am Fuß der blauen Berge&quot; (&quot;At the Foot of the Blue Mountains&quot;), despite them being located some 600 miles north-west from Laramie, Wyoming.

==Episodes==

==Background and production==
Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s contract was not renewed after the first season, and his character was eliminated with the explanation that he had accompanied Andy to boarding school in St. Louis. Andy, however, returned to appear in three episodes in the first half of the second season.

To restore the chemistry of the original cast, as the third season began in 1961, Spring Byington, formerly of the sitcom &quot;December Bride&quot;, and Dennis Holmes joined the series in the roles of Daisy Cooper, a matronly widow, and Mike Williams, a young orphan permitted to live at the Sherman Ranch pending location of any next of kin, which never happened. At the beginning of its third season, &quot;Laramie&quot; was one of the first television programs that made the transition from black-and-white to color.

Because of declining ratings in its last season, &quot;Laramie&quot; was canceled.

=== The Laramie Peacock ===
The NBC peacock logo, in use since 1956, was given an update on January 2, 1962, when a new version of the NBC peacock &quot;living color&quot; logo was introduced before the &quot;Laramie&quot; broadcast that evening. The &quot;Laramie Peacock&quot; featured the bird fanning its plumage against a kaleidoscopic color background (with the eleven melded feathers shrinking and separating into the peacock&#x27;s form); it used the same &quot;living color&quot; tagline as the first peacock but the music piece that accompanied it was a soft, woodwind-based number. This symbol was used before every color program on the network until it was retired in 1975, but the &quot;Laramie&quot; version has made special appearances throughout the ensuing years, mostly in a retro-kitsch context or to commemorate a significant broadcast event on NBC.

==Release==

=== Broadcast ===
&quot;Laramie&quot; ran for four seasons, from September 15, 1959, to September 17, 1963, Tuesday evenings on NBC from 7:30 8:30pm Eastern.

=== Home media ===
Timeless Media Group has released all four seasons on DVD in Region 1.

<text>The Cinerama Dome is a movie theater located at 6360 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Designed to exhibit widescreen Cinerama films, it opened November 7, 1963. The original developer was William R. Forman,&lt;ref name=&quot;archive/motionpictureexh72jaye&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety/1234996192&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety/1234950561&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;losangelestheatres/cinerama&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;labusinessjournal/forman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/1981/05/04/William-R-Forman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; founder of Pacific Theatres. The Cinerama Dome continued as a leading first-run theater, most recently as part of the ArcLight Hollywood complex, until it closed temporarily in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California. The ArcLight chain closed permanently in April 2021, with the theater never having reopened. In June 2022, it was announced that there were plans to reopen it and the former ArcLight Hollywood under a new name, Cinerama Hollywood.

== History ==
In February 1963, Cinerama Inc. unveiled a radically new design for theaters that would show its movies. They would be based on the geodesic dome developed by R. Buckminster Fuller, would cost half as much as conventional theaters of comparable size, and could be built in half the time. Cinerama&#x27;s goal was to see at least 600 built worldwide within two years. The following April, Pacific Theatres Inc. announced plans to build the first theater based upon the design, and had begun razing existing buildings at the construction site. Located on Sunset near Vine Street, it would be the first new major motion-picture theater in Hollywood in 33 years and would be completed in time for the scheduled November 2 press premiere of &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. The design was proposed by French architect Pierre Cabrol, lead designer in the noted architectural firm of Welton Becket and Associates. Pierre Cabrol worked with R. Buckminster Fuller during his studies at MIT.

Pacific Theatres founder, William R. Forman, announced the construction of the Cinerama Dome in July 1963 at a star-studded, ground-breaking ceremony where Spencer Tracy, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Edie Adams, and Dorothy Provine donned hard hats, and, with picks and shovels, began construction. Forman had committed to United Artists that the theatre would be ready for the November 7, 1963, world premiere of the first movie filmed in the new 70mm, single-strip Cinerama process, Stanley Kramer&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World&quot;. Working around the clock, the entire construction spanned only 16 weeks. The Cinerama Dome is the only concrete geodesic dome in the world. The theatre is made up of 316 individual hexagonal and pentagonal shapes in 16 different sizes. Each of these pieces is approximately across and weighs around . The theatre also has design elements such as a loge section with stadium seating, architecturally significant floating stairways, and, at the time of its opening, the largest contoured motion-picture screen in the world, measuring high and wide, with a maximum aspect ratio of 2.69:1.

The It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World premiere (filmed in Ultra Panavision 70) marked the dawn of &quot;single lens&quot; Cinerama. Previously, Cinerama was known for its groundbreaking three-projector process. From 1963 until 2002, the Cinerama Dome never showed movies with the three-projector process. (The nearby Warner Cinerama at 6433 Hollywood Boulevard used the three-projector process until December 1964.) A unique &quot;rectified&quot; print was made with increased anamorphic compression towards the sides, which compensated for distortions that would otherwise be induced by Cinerama&#x27;s deeply curved screen.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, after a two-year closure, the Cinerama Dome was reopened as a part of Pacific Theatres&#x27; ArcLight Hollywood complex. The dome remains essentially unchanged, though there have been improvements, notably, in the acoustics. But for the first time ever, the Cinerama Dome began showing movies in the three-projector format. It is one of four known Cinerama theaters left in the world, the others include: Pictureville Cinema, Seattle Cinerama, The New Neon Cinema, and Cinerama restorationist and former Canadian broadcast engineer, Tom H. March&#x27;s Calgary basement.

: &quot;Cinerama was installed at the National Media Museum (formerly the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television) in Bradford, UK&quot; (Pictureville Cinema)

: &quot;The Cinerama Preservation Society, Inc. presented true three-projector showings of Cinerama films at the Neon Movies (Dayton, Ohio) between 1996 and 2000.&quot;

The Cinerama Dome made its digital projection debut in May 2005 with &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. In 2009, James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; was the first 3D film to be shown in the Cinerama Dome, using technology from XpanD 3D.

In December 2015, the Cinerama Dome upgraded to a laser-projection system, using two Christie 6P projectors and Dolby 3D. The venue is still capable of both 35mm and 70mm-film projection.

In April 2021, the parent company of Pacific Theatres announced that it would not be reopening any of its locations, including the Cinerama Dome, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in the year, it was reported that a permit had been filed with provisions for a bar and restaurant.

In June 2022, it was reported that Decurion Corp. had plans to reopen the theater under the name Cinerama Hollywood along with the adjoining fourteen-screen multiplex. There were also plans to include two bars and a restaurant at the location. Three months later, it was reported that the theater would not be reopening until at least the latter part of 2023; however, in May 2023, it was reported that it was delayed once again to the latter part of 2024. In November 2023, the cinema&#x27;s reopening was again delayed this time until the second quarter of 2025 due mostly in part to the redesign happening in the space including the addition of restaurants and event space.

== Preservation ==
With its wide screen, advanced acoustics and 70mm film capability, the Cinerama Dome remained a favorite for film premieres and &quot;event&quot; showings. But by the late 1990s, the motion picture exhibition business began to favor multiplex cinemas, and Pacific Theatres proposed a plan to remodel the Dome as a part of a shopping mall/cinema complex. Historical preservationists were outraged, not wishing to see another great theater turned into a multiplex or destroyed. At the same time, a small contingent of Cinerama enthusiasts had begun resurrecting the three-projector process. They and the preservationists prevailed upon Pacific to rethink its plans for the property.

The preservation of the Cinerama Dome came at a time when most other surviving Cinerama theaters were being demolished. An example of this was the case of the Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, Nebraska, a round Cinerama theater boasting a 110-foot screen that was razed in 2001 to make room for a parking lot.

The Cinerama Dome was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1998.

<text>The Spanish Grand Prix (, ) is a Formula One motor racing event currently held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. The race is one of the oldest in the world still contested, celebrating its centenary in 2013. The race had modest beginnings as a production car race. Interrupted by the First World War, the race waited a decade for its second running before becoming a staple of the European calendar. In 1927 it was part of the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship; it was promoted to the European Championship in 1935 before the Spanish Civil War brought an end to racing. The race was successfully revived in 1967 and has been a regular part of the Formula One World Championship since 1968 (except 1982–1985) at a variety of venues.

The event is due to take place at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya until 2026. From 2026 until at least 2035 the race will be run at a new circuit near Madrid.

==History==

===Origins and pre-war===
The first race generally considered to be a Spanish Grand Prix was held in 1913. Though not run to the Grand Prix formula of the day, instead it was a race for touring cars, taking place on a 300-kilometre road circuit at Guadarrama, near Madrid, on the road to Valladolid. It was officially named the RACE Grand Prix (after the Royal Automobile Club of Spain) and was won by Carlos de Salamanca with Rolls-Royce.

Motor racing events had taken place in Spain prior to that—the most notable among them being the Catalan Cup held annually from 1908 to 1910, on roads around Sitges, near Barcelona. The first event was won by Giosuè Giuppone on a Lion-Peugeot, with both following events won by Jules Goux, also driving a Lion-Peugeot, these races helping to establish a strong racing tradition in Spain, which has continued to this day. This enthusiasm for racing led to the plan to build a permanent track at Sitges—a oval that became known as Sitges-Terramar, and was the site of the first race to officially carry the title Spanish Grand Prix in 1923, won by Albert Divo in a Sunbeam.

====Lasarte====
After this first race, the track fell into financial difficulties, and the organisers had to look for another venue. In 1926, the Spanish Grand Prix moved to the Circuito Lasarte on the northern coast near Bilbao, home of the main race in Spain during the 1920s—the San Sebastián Grand Prix. The 1927 Spanish Grand Prix was part of the AIACR World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, but the race was still not established and in 1928 and 1929 was run to sports car regulations. The 1930 Spanish Grand Prix for sports cars, scheduled for 27 July, was cancelled due to the bad economic situation following the Wall Street crash in October 1929. The 1931 and 1932 Spanish Grands Prix were also announced, only to be cancelled due to political and economic difficulties. Finally, in 1933 the Spanish Grand Prix was revived at Lasarte with government backing. Following the 1935 race, Spain descended into civil war and racing stopped. In 1946, racing returned to Spain in the form of the Penya Rhin Grand Prix at the Pedralbes street circuit in Barcelona.

===Formula One===

====Pedralbes====

Spain did not return to the international calendar until 1951, joining the list of races of the Formula One championship at the very wide Pedralbes street circuit in Barcelona. Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio won his first world championship at the 1951 event in an Alfa Romeo while he took advantage of the improved works Ferrari&#x27;s tire problems. The race was scheduled for the 1952 and 1953 seasons but did not take place due to a lack of money, and in 1954, Briton Mike Hawthorn stopped Mercedes&#x27;s dominance by winning in a Ferrari. In 1955, the Spanish Grand Prix at Pedralbes was scheduled to take place, but a terrible accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans that killed more than 80 people resulted in regulations governing spectator safety, and the scheduled Spanish Grand Prix (like many others) was cancelled that year and for the subsequent 2 years (also owing to more problems with money to hold the race), and the wide but pedestrian-lined street track at Pedralbes was then never used again for motor racing.

====Jarama and Montjuïc====

In the 1960s, Spain made a bid to return to the world of international motor racing—the Royal Automobile Club of Spain commissioned a new permanent racing circuit just north of Madrid at Jarama, and the Spanish government refurbished the Montjuïc street circuit in Barcelona with safety upgrades. A non-championship Grand Prix took place at Jarama in 1967, which was won by Jim Clark racing in a Lotus F1 car.

In 1968, Jarama hosted the Spanish Grand Prix, near the beginning of the F1 season. It was agreed, following this event, that the race would alternate between the tight, slow and twisty Jarama and the fast, wide and sweeping Montjuïc, and the Montjuïc circuit hosted its first Formula One race in 1969, with Briton Jackie Stewart winning. Jarama would get the race in even-numbered years, and Montjuïc in odd-numbered years. 1970 was a race that saw Belgian Jacky Ickx and Briton Jackie Oliver get involved in a fiery accident; with Ickx and Oliver escaping with burns. The race was won by Stewart, he won again the next year after holding off 3 more powerful 12-cylinder engined cars. Austrian Niki Lauda won his first of 25 races in 1974. The 1975 event was marked by tragedy. There had been concerns about track safety during practice races, as the Armco barriers surrounding the city streets of the Montjuïc circuit had not been fastened down properly. There were a number of protests, and the drivers refused to race. The organizers panicked, and they threatened to lock the cars inside the stadium where they stayed while not being raced. The drivers and teams relented; but double-winner Emerson Fittipaldi retired in protest after a single lap. On the 26th lap of the race, Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s car crashed when the rear wing broke off, killing four spectators. The race was stopped on the 29th lap and won by Jochen Mass, though only half the points were awarded.

====Jarama====

After the tragic events at the dangerously fast and tight space of Montjuïc, the Spanish Grand Prix was confined to Jarama. The 1976 race saw Briton James Hunt take advantage of Lauda&#x27;s broken ribs in a tractor accident; he was then disqualified after his McLaren was found to be 1.8 inches too wide. McLaren appealed the decision, and it was successful; Hunt&#x27;s points were restored. 1977 and 1978 saw Mario Andretti dominate in his ground-effect Lotus 78. The 1980 race was of note, because on the Friday morning of race weekend, FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announced the Spanish &quot;Grand Prix&quot; would not be counted as a championship race. As a result, none of the factory teams (Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo) showed up for the event and only the independent constructors belonging to FOCA competed. The race was won by Alan Jones in a Williams. 1981 was a race that Gilles Villeneuve in his ill-handling Ferrari held off 4 better-handling cars to take victory on the twisty and confined circuit; this is considered one of the greatest drives in all motorsports. But the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama was then also dropped from the racing calendar after being cancelled in 1982 because the organizers seemed more interested in the golf course near the circuit, and because of the narrow track, unpleasantly hot late June conditions, and small crowd at that year&#x27;s race; it would return in 1986.

====Jerez====

An attempt to revive the Spanish Grand Prix on a street circuit in the southwestern resort town of Fuengirola for 1984 and 1985 did not work out; but in 1985, the Mayor of Jerez commissioned a new racing circuit in his town to promote tourism and sherries. The track, the Circuito Permanente de Jerez, located near Seville in southern Spain was finished in time for the championship, which saw a furious battle between Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell, with the two cars finishing side by side. Senna won by 0.014 seconds—one of F1&#x27;s closest finishes. 1987 saw Mansell win in his Williams; and 1989 saw Senna drive a hard race to keep himself in the championship points; he won the event from Austrian Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari and the Brazilian&#x27;s fierce rival and McLaren teammate, Frenchman Alain Prost. The 1990 event was the last Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez (although Jerez did stage the European Grand Prix in 1994 and 1997). During the practice, Martin Donnelly&#x27;s Lotus was destroyed in a high-speed crash, and the Briton was ejected from the car. He was severely injured, but survived; he never raced in Formula One again. Jerez&#x27;s remote location did not help build large crowds for the race, combined with Donnelly&#x27;s appalling crash into Armco barriers close to the track did nothing to help Jerez&#x27;s reputation; although the circuit was popular with the F1 fraternity. Ferrari finished first and second in the race, with Prost finishing ahead of Mansell.

====Catalunya====

Work on the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was underway in Montmeló, few kilometres from Barcelona, thanks to the support of the Spanish government, and in 1991, the event moved to this new track, where it has remained since. The 1992 event was advertised as the Grand Prix of the Olympic Games. Since that race the race has been held in early season, usually in late April or early May.

The Williams team dominated the first outings there, taking all victories until 1994. Michael Schumacher has won a total of six times, including his 1996 victory in heavy rain, which was his first for Ferrari. Mika Häkkinen took three victories and was on road for fourth in 2001 before his car failed on the last lap.

Since 2003 the race has been well attended thanks to success of Fernando Alonso. Alonso finished second in 2003 and 2005 before taking victory from pole in 2006. Alonso also finished third in 2007, with two further second places in 2010 and 2012, where he finished behind the Williams of Spanish speaking Pastor Maldonado, who won from pole; this was the first win and pole in a Grand Prix for a Venezuelan driver and Williams&#x27;s first win since the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix and the team&#x27;s first Spanish Grand Prix win and pole since 1997.
Two Spanish drivers have won the Spanish Grand Prix; Carlos de Salamanca in 1913 and Alonso in 2006 and 2013, with Spanish speaking Juan Manuel Fangio winning in 1951 as well as Maldonado in 2012.

From , the Spanish Grand Prix was due to alternate every year between Catalunya and the Valencia Street Circuit. However, this did not happen—Valencia dropped out for financial reasons and Catalunya remained the sole host of the Spanish Grand Prix.

Only four of the 19 races at this track between 2001 and 2019 have not been won from pole position.

The 2020 race was postponed from May to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race returned in 2021; Lewis Hamilton won the race after passing Max Verstappen after making an additional pit stop.

The layout of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya changed in 2023 to use the layout currently used by MotoGP since 2021.

==== Madrid ====
Spain&#x27;s capital city, Madrid, has been nominated as a future host of Formula One, with a target debut in 2025. However, it was pushed back to 2026. The new street circuit will be located around the IFEMA Palacio Municipal in Madrid.

<text>Scott of the Antarctic is a 1948 British adventure film starring John Mills as Robert Falcon Scott in his ill-fated attempt to reach the South Pole. The film more or less faithfully recreates the events that befell the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition in 1912.

The film was directed by Charles Frend from screenplay by Ivor Montagu and Walter Meade with &quot;additional dialogue&quot; by the novelist Mary Hayley Bell (Mills&#x27; wife). The film score was by Ralph Vaughan Williams, who reworked elements of it into his 1952 &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot;. The supporting cast included James Robertson Justice, Derek Bond, Kenneth More, John Gregson, Barry Letts and Christopher Lee.

Much of the film was shot in Technicolor at Ealing Studios in London. Landscape and glacier exteriors were shot in the Swiss Alps and in Norway. Background scenes were shot in the Antarctic islands.

==Plot==
Captain Scott is given the men, but not the funds, to go on a second expedition to the Antarctic. As his wife works on a bust of him, she tells him that she is &quot;not the least jealous&quot; that he is going to the Antarctic again. The wife of Dr. E. A. Wilson, whom Scott hopes to recruit, is much less enthusiastic, but Wilson agrees to go on condition it is a scientific expedition. Scott also visits Fridtjof Nansen, who insists that a polar expedition must use only dogs, not the motor sledges or ponies that Scott proposes. Scott goes on a fundraising campaign, with mixed results, finding scepticism among Liverpool businessmen who are interested primarily in economic opportunities, but also enthusiasm among schoolchildren who help fund the sledge dogs. With the assistance of a government grant he finally manages to raise just enough money to finance the expedition, with some economies.

After a stop in New Zealand, the ship sets sail for Antarctica. They set up a camp at the coast, where they spend the winter and hold a Midwinter Feast on 22 June 1911. In the spring a small contingent of men, ponies and dogs begins the trek towards the pole. About halfway, the ponies are, as planned, shot for food and some of the men are sent back with the dogs. At the three-quarter mark, Scott selects the five-man team to make the push to the pole, hoping to return by the end of March 1912. They reach the pole only to find the Norwegian flag already planted there and a letter from Roald Amundsen asking Scott to deliver it to the King of Norway.

Hugely disappointed, Scott&#x27;s team begins the long journey back. When reaching the mountains bordering the polar plateau, Wilson shows the men some sea plant and tree fossils he has found, also a piece of coal, proving that the Antarctic must have been a warm place once. Scott ironically notes the economic possibilities. Scott is increasingly concerned about the health of two men: Evans, who has a serious cut on his hand, and Oates, whose foot is badly frostbitten. Evans eventually collapses and dies, and is buried under the snow. Realising that his condition is slowing the team down, Oates says &quot;I hope I don&#x27;t wake tomorrow&quot; but when he does, he sacrifices himself by crawling out of the tent, saying &quot;I&#x27;m just going outside; I may be away some time.&quot; (; the words as famously recorded by Scott are &quot;...and may be some time&quot;). Finally, just 11 miles short of a supply depot, the rest of the team dies in their tent trapped by a blizzard. Each man writes his farewell letters, with frostbitten Scott also writing his famous &quot;Message to the Public&quot;, saying &quot;I do not regret this journey...&quot;

Months later, on a clear sunny day, the search party discovers the completely snowed-over tent. After a shot of Scott&#x27;s diary being recovered, the film ends with the sight of a wooden cross with the five names of the dead inscribed on it as well as the quote: &quot;To strive to seek to find and not to yield.&quot; (Commas left out; a line from the poem &quot;Ulysses&quot;, by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.)

==Production==
===Development===
Towards the end of the war, Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, was keen to &quot;carry on the tradition that made British documentary film preeminent during the war. These were the days when we were inspired by the heroic deeds typical of British greatness.&quot;

In 1944, Charles Frend and Sidney Cole pitched the idea of a film about the Scott expedition. Balcon was interested, so they wrote up a story treatment which Balcon approved. Ealing secured co-operation from Scott&#x27;s widow (who would die in 1947). Walter Meade wrote the first draft.

The extensive number of interviews that were done with surviving team members and relatives from Scott&#x27;s expedition were acknowledged at the start of the film with the credit:
&quot;This film could not have been made without the generous co-operation of the survivors and the relatives of late members of Scott&#x27;s Last Expedition. To them and to those many other persons and organisations too numerous to mention individually who gave such able assistance and encouragement, the producers express their deepest gratitude.&quot;

===Casting===
In 1947 it was announced that John Mills, then one of the biggest stars in Britain, would play the title role.

&quot;This is the most responsible thing I have done in films,&quot; said Mills. &quot;I was only about four when the tragedy happened, but Scott has always been one of my heroes and it&#x27;s jolly satisfying to feel that the job of helping to bring the great story of British enterprise and grit to the screen has fallen to me.&quot; During the making of the film, Mills wore Scott&#x27;s actual watch which had been recovered from his body.

It was an early role for Kenneth More whose audition was arranged by Stewart Granger, whose wife Elspeth March had appeared in a play with More. He wrote &quot;the script wasn&#x27;t right. &quot;Scott&quot; was a bad film—despite John Mills&#x27; magnificent performance—and certainly it was not the happiest to work on.&quot;

===Filming===
After three years&#x27; research for the film, cameraman Osmond Borradaile travelled and spent six months between 1946 and 1947 shooting footage in the Antarctic at Hope Bay, as well as in the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands.

Filming started in June 1947 in Switzerland for four weeks, at the Jungfrau Mountain and the Aletsch Glacier. In October 1947 there was a further nine weeks&#x27; location filming in Norway, near Finse, which was used to represent the area near the South Pole. The bulk of the scenes were shot at the Hardanger Jokul.
The film&#x27;s unit transferred to Ealing Studios in London for three months of studio work.

==Release==
The film was chosen for a Royal Command Film Performance in 1948.

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;Variety&quot; felt the documentary-style approach robbed the piece of much of its drama.

===Box office===
&quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; was the third-most-popular film at the British box office in 1949. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the &#x27;biggest winner&#x27; at the box office in 1949 Britain was &quot;The Third Man&quot; with &quot;runners up&quot; being &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;, &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, &quot;Paleface&quot;, &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Maytime in Mayfair&quot;, &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;Red River&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Sleep Here&quot;.

The film earned distributor&#x27;s gross receipts of £214,223 in the UK of which £165,967 went to the producer. The film also performed well at the box office in Japan.

The film made a loss of £205,261.

===Music===

In 1953 Ralph Vaughan Williams recast and expanded his score for the film into his Seventh Symphony, &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot; and, thus, the music for the film has come to be better known than the film itself.

==Historical accuracy==
===Differences===
There are several differences in the film from the real events.

In the film, Scott receives a telegram in New Zealand, but does not read it for himself or to the crew until his ship is &quot;en route&quot; to the Antarctic. It says: &quot;I am going south. Amundsen&quot;. Scott and his crew immediately comprehend that Amundsen is heading for the South Pole. In fact, Scott received this telegram a little earlier, in Australia, and Amundsen&#x27;s true text was less clear: &quot;Beg leave to inform you Fram proceeding Antarctic Amundsen.&quot; [&quot;Fram&quot; was Amundsen&#x27;s ship.] As Amundsen had publicly announced he was going to the North Pole, the real Scott and his companions did not initially grasp Amundsen&#x27;s ambiguous message, according to Tryggve Gran&#x27;s diary (Gran was Scott&#x27;s only Norwegian expedition member).

In the film, the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; disembarks Scott&#x27;s team in the Antarctic, sails along the ice barrier without Scott and unexpectedly discovers Amundsen&#x27;s Antarctic base camp. The ship therefore returns to Scott&#x27;s base camp and informs Scott about Amundsen&#x27;s presence in the vicinity. In fact, Scott was not at his base camp during this unscheduled return of his ship but was busy laying depots in the interior of the Antarctic.

The film quotes Scott&#x27;s transport plans as &quot;from the glacier to the pole and all the way back—man hauling&quot;. In reality, Scott had instructed the base camp team to meet and fetch him with dog teams on the return journey around 1 March at latitude 82 degrees. The order was never carried out and Scott and his men died on their way home.

In the film, just before reaching the South Pole, Scott&#x27;s team sight a distant flag, and realise the race is lost. In the next scene, the men arrive at Amundsen&#x27;s empty tent flying a Norwegian flag at the Pole, and notice the paw prints of Amundsen&#x27;s sledge-dogs. In reality, Scott and his men discovered the &quot;sledge tracks and ski tracks going and coming and the clear trace of dogs&#x27; paws—many dogs&quot; on the previous day when they came to a black flag Amundsen had left to mark his way back.

The film gives the impression that Scott starts to doubt at the South Pole whether he would manage to return to base camp safely, quoting &quot;Now for the run home and a desperate struggle. I wonder if we can do it&quot;. In fact, Scott wrote &quot;Now for the run home and a desperate struggle &quot;to get the news through first&quot;. I wonder if we can do it&quot; (both he and Amundsen had lucrative agreements with the media on exclusive interviews, but Scott now had little chance to beat Amundsen to the cablehead in Australia). The published diary omitted these six words, which were only re-discovered long after the film was produced.

===Causes of the tragedy===
Given that some 1912 expedition members were still alive and were consulted in the production process, the film depicts the causes of the tragedy as they were considered in 1948.

* In Norway, Scott consults the veteran polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who urges Scott to rely only on dogs. Scott on the other hand insists on a variety of transport means, including motor sledges, ponies, and dogs. The historical background to Scott&#x27;s portrayed reluctance is that on his 1904 expedition, Scott&#x27;s dogs had died of disease while Ernest Shackleton in 1908 had nearly attained the South Pole using ponies.
*Scott&#x27;s depicted fundraising speech is not effective and the government only gives him £20,000. To make the expedition possible anyway, he cancels one of his two planned ships, and settles on the dilapidated &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, a photo of which he optimistically shows to Wilson, who is unmoved. This scene reflects the real Apsley Cherry-Garrard&#x27;s criticism over the lack of funds and the inappropriate ship in his book &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;.
* Arriving in Antarctic waters, the ship is briefly seen to fight its way through pack-ice. The parallel to the real expedition is that the ship was delayed for the unusual period of 20 days in the pack-ice, shortening the available season for preparations.
* Having ascended the glacier up to the polar plateau, Scott sends home one of the supporting parties, addressing its leader Atkinson (&quot;Atch&quot;) with the following words &quot;Bye Atch. Look out for us about the beginning of March. With any luck we will be back before the ship has to go.&quot; This paraphrases Scott&#x27;s real order to the dog teams to assist him home to base camp around 1 March at latitude 82 degrees. The order was never carried out and so Scott and his men died on their way home at the end of March.
* On the return journey from the pole, the men found that the stove oil canisters in the depots were not full. The seals were not broken so they speculate that the oil has evaporated.

<doc id="526368" wikidata="Q56318" url="?curid=526368" title="Komi-Permyak language">
<text>Komi-Permyak (, , or , ), also known as Permyak, is one of two Permic varieties in the Uralic language family that form a pluricentric language, the other being Komi-Zyryan. Udmurt is another Permic language spoken outside of the region and not a member of the Komi pluricentric language.

The Komi-Permyak language, spoken in Perm Krai of Russia and written using the Komi Cyrillic alphabet, was co-official with Russian in the Komi-Permyak Okrug of Perm Krai.

==Glottonym==

The original name of the Komi-Permyak language is &quot;коми кыв&quot; &quot;Komi language&quot;, identical with the native name of the Komi-Zyryan language.

In the 1920s, the Soviet authorities introduced the new name for the Komi language in the Perm Region as &quot;коми-пермяцкий язык&quot;, the Komi-Permian language, combining the native name of the language with the Russian one. The new name was transliterated in Komi as &quot;коми-пермяцкöй кыв&quot; &#x27;Komi-Permyak language&#x27;. In this way, the local language was nominally separated from the Komi-Zyryan language, that officially received the original name, the Komi language. The Komis of the Perm Region had to officially use the new name, even though it has negative connotations for the speakers, continuing to use the original name, the Komi language, exclusively in their colloquial speech.

Only in the early years of the first decade of the 2000s has there begun a controversial process of replacing the offensive official name with a more correct one. The term &quot;перем коми кыв&quot; &#x27;Permian Komi language&#x27; was proposed and it is used nowadays (alongside the old term) in local mass-media, in scientific papers and in the Komi-Permyak version of Wikipedia.

==Dialects==

All of the Komi-Permyak dialects are easily mutually intelligible and, to a lesser extent, mutually intelligible with the Komi-Zyryan dialects.

The Komi-Permyak dialects may be divided geographically into Northern and Southern groups, and phonemically into /l/ and /v/ groups:

# Northern
#*/l/ type: лым /lɨm/ &quot;snow&quot;, вӧл /vɘl/ &quot;a horse&quot;, вӧлтӧг /vɘltɘg/ &quot;without a horse&quot;, вӧлӧн /vɘlɘn/ &quot;with a horse, on a horse&quot;
#**Upper Lupya
#**Mysy (former rural council)
#**Kosa-Kama
#**Kochevo
#**Zyuzdino (Afanasyevo)
#**Yazva
# Southern
#*/v/ type: вым /vɨm/, вӧв /vɘv/, вӧвтӧг /vɘvtɘg/, вӧвӧн /vɘvɘn/
#**Kudymkar-Inva
#**Lower Inva
#*Southern /l/ type: лым /lɨm/, вӧл /vɘl/, вӧлтӧг /vɘltɘg/, вӧлӧн /vɘlɘn/
#**On
#**Nerdva

Formerly a southern dialect group existed in the Obva river basin, but it is now extinct except for the Nerdva dialect. Because of this the latter is nowadays usually considered together with the central group, which in this way has become &quot;southern&quot;.

The central (new southern) and northern groups of Komi-Permyak are spoken in Komi Okrug of Perm Krai, where the language was standardized in the 1920s. The modern standard is based on Kudymkar dialect of the central group, but many elements of northern dialects were included as well, so that the &quot;literary language&quot; has significant differences in its morphological system from the &quot;main&quot; dialect.

The central dialects, spoken in the Ińva river basin, differ considerably from the other Komi-Permyak dialects due to the general shift of etymological /l/ to /v/, then to /w/, and finally to the disappearance of the consonant, which has triggered significant changes in morphology.

The differences between the Kudymkar and Uliś Ińva dialects are mainly in accentuation: the Uliś Ińva has a phonological stress (the Öń too), whereas the Kudymkar dialect (like as Ńerdva) has a morphological one. The Ńerdva dialect retains the etymological /l/. The same can be said about the Öń dialect (recently extinct), that had connections with the eastern Permian.

The northern group of the Permian dialects (upon Kösva, Kama and Lup rivers) was under a strong Zyryan influence on all levels. The Köć and Kös dialects are closely related with some Syktyv dialects of Zyryan, whereas the Lup dialect was in tenuous connections with the Upper Ezhva dialect for a long time.

The Komi-Permyak standard language refers only to the central and northern groups of the Komi-Permyak dialects. They can be called as proper Permian dialects. The other two groups are marginal.

An only relic of the eastern Permian is the Yaźva dialect, ca. 200 speakers of the ca. 900 ethnical Komis in Krasnovishersky District of Perm Krai. In the early 2000s (decade) it was standardized by authority of the krai. The dialect has archaic system of vowels (including /ö/, /ü/ and /ʌ/), while its accentuation is similar to Uliś Ińva&#x27;s and its lexical system is like the Northern Permian one.

The Western Permian group is represented by another marginal dialect, Źuźdin (ca. 1000 persons living in Kirov Oblast near the border of Komi Okrug).

==Phonology==
In the Komi-Permyak standard language there are the same 26 main consonants and 7 vowels as in Komi-Zyryan.

===Consonants===
Komi-Permyak&#x27;s modern consonant system includes 26 native ones, and the additional consonants /ts/, /f/, /x/ in Russian loanwords. In traditional speech the &quot;foreign sounds&quot; were replaced with /t͡ɕ/, /p/, and /k/, respectively.
# Only in Russian loanwords.
# There is also a phoneme // which mostly occurs paralinguistically and only in 1 word &quot;Бунгаг&quot; [ʙuŋɡaɡ] outside it.

===Vowels===

The Komi-Permyak vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by three features: front and back, rounded and unrounded and vowel height.

Komi-Permyak does not distinguish between long and short vowels and does not have vowel harmony. There are no diphthongs; when two vowels come together, which occurs at some morpheme boundaries, each vowel retains its individual sound.

==Writing system==

Both regional standards of the Komi language have an identical alphabet, introduced in 1938. The alphabet (anbur, анбур) includes all the Russian letters plus two additional graphemes: і and ӧ.

==Grammar==
Komi-Permyak is an agglutinating language. It uses affixes to express possession, to specify mode, time, and so on.

===Nouns===
All Permian Komi nouns are declined for number, case and possession, adding special suffixes to word stems.

====Number====

In Permian Komi there are two grammatical numbers: singular and plural. The singular is the unmarked form of a word, and the plural is obtained by inflecting the singular.

The plural marker of nouns is /ez/ (orthographically эз or ез) immediately following a word stem before any case or other affixes. The last consonant of the stem before the plural suffix has to be duplicated.

The plural suffix has also a reduced variant (a &quot;weak form&quot;) /е/ (orth. э or е), that is used combining with some weak forms of possessive suffixes, e.g. киэт &#x27;your (Sg.) hands &#x27; versa киэз &#x27;hands&#x27;.

====Possession====

The Permian Komi possessive suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a case suffix depending on case. The three suffixes of singular possession have in addition to their main forms the weak variants used combining with a weak form of plural suffix, weak forms of some cases or forming the suffixes of plural possession.
# 

The possessive suffix of 3Sg is widely used also as a definite article. In colloquial speech it is the main meaning of this suffix.

====Cases====

It is assumed, that the Permian Komi standard language has eighteen noun cases: ten grammatical cases and eight locative cases. The disputes continue about the status of some monosyllabic postpositions and a set of dialectal reduced forms of postpositions that can be treated as case suffixes too. The maximal number of all possible cases reaches 30.

The case suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a possessive suffix depending on case. Some cases have weak variants of their suffixes combining with the weak variants of possessive suffixes.

===Adjectives===
Used attributively, Permian Komi adjectives precede the nouns they modify, and are not declined: басöк нывка &#x27;beautiful girl&#x27; → басöк нывкаэслö &#x27;to the beautiful girls&#x27;.

However most adjectives can also be used as nouns and sometimes as appositions, in which case they are declined: e.g. ыджыт (&quot;big&quot;) → ыджыттэзісь (&quot;out of the bigs&quot;). The declensional paradigma is the same as by nouns, except the main accusative form, that became by adjectives suffix ö instead of öс or a null morpheme by nouns: адззи басöк нывкаöс &#x27;I have found a beautiful girl&#x27; → адззи басöкö &#x27;I have found a beautiful [girl]&#x27;.

Being predicative an adjective agrees with the subject for number. The plural marker of the predicative is öсь: керкуыс ыджыт &#x27;the house is big &#x27; → керкуэc ыджытöсь &#x27;the houses are big&#x27;.

The adjective in Permian Komi have five degrees of comparison

The comparative and the superlative compare the intensity of an object&#x27;s quality with the other object&#x27;s one. The sative, excessive and diminutive compare the intensity of the quality with its basic degree.

===Numerals===
The numerals in Komi-Permyak

===Personal pronouns===
Komi personal pronouns inflect in all the cases. The language makes no distinction between &quot;he&quot;,&quot; she&quot; and &quot;it&quot;. The nominative case of personal pronouns are listed in the following table:

===Verbs===

Permian Komi verbs show tense (present, future, past), mood (indicative, imperative, evidential, optative, conditional and conjunctive), voice and aspect.

The verbal stem is a 2nd person singular of imperative mode: мун &#x27;go&#x27;, кер &#x27;make&#x27;. All the other forms are formed by adding suffixes to the stem.

Some verbal stems having a consonant cluster at the end become expanded with a so-called &quot;voyelle de soutien&quot; which is dropped before the suffixes beginning with a vowel: = &#x27;hear&#x27;, &#x27;swear&#x27; = , e. g. &#x27;to hear&#x27;, &#x27;by hearing&#x27; but &#x27;I heard&#x27;, &#x27;he hears&#x27;, &#x27;you hear&#x27;. Thus, these stems with a consonant cluster have their full und reduced variants.

Permian infinitives are marked with added to a stem as in &#x27;to go&#x27;, &#x27;hear&#x27;

All Permian Komi verbs are conjugated in the same way, except for the defective verb &#x27;to be&#x27;.

Negation is mostly expressed by a conjugated negator preceding the stem, e. g. &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go&#x27;.

The indicative mood has three tenses: present, future and past. The main marker of the present and future tense is а (negat. о), the marker of the past tense is и (negat. э).

<doc id="526383" wikidata="Q4871801" url="?curid=526383" title="Battle of Mount Harriet">
<text>The Battle of Mount Harriet was an engagement of the Falklands War, which took place on the night of 11/12 June 1982 between British and Argentine forces. It was one of three battles in a Brigade-size operation all on the same night, the other two being the Battle of Mount Longdon and the Battle of Two Sisters.

One of a number of night battles that took place during the British advance towards Stanley, the battle led to British troops capturing all the heights above the town, allowing its capture and the surrender of the Argentine forces on the islands.

==Background==
The British force consisted of 42 Commando (42 CDO), Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Nick Vaux, Royal Marines (he later became a general), with artillery support from a battery of 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery. Engineer support from 2Tp, 59 Independent Commando Squadron (59 Ind CDO Sqn), Royal Engineers. The 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards (1WG) and two companies from 40 Commando (40 CDO) were in reserve. HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; provided naval gunfire support.

The Argentine defenders consisted of ex-Army Green Beret Captain Carlos Alberto Arroyo&#x27;s B Company from Lieutenant Colonel Diego Alejandro Soria&#x27;s 4th &quot;Monte Caseros&quot; Infantry Regiment (RI 4). On 1 June, the Argentine defenders on Harriet and Two Sisters, after having abandoned their field kitchens in their original positions on Mount Challenger, were given permission by their officers to consume their cold-weather ration packs, which helped raise the morale of the conscripts.

On the night of 30 May, elements of K Company, led by Captain Peter Babbington of 42 CDO boarded three Sea King helicopters and moved forward of San Carlos to secure Mount Kent at , one of the tallest of the peaks surrounding Stanley where Major Cedric Delves&#x27; D Squadron from the Special Air Service (SAS) had established a presence. When the Royal Marines reinforcements in the Sea Kings, and 7 &#x27;Sphinx&#x27; Battery of the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery aboard a Chinook helicopter arrived at the landing zone, 3 kilometres (2 miles) behind the ridge of the mountain, they were met by gun-flashes, mortar fire and tracer rounds as another clash involving D Squadron was taking place. Captain Gavin Hamilton&#x27;s Mountain Troop had this time spotted enemy movement in the form of Captain Tomás Fernández&#x27; 2nd Assault Section, 602 Commando Company trying to exit the area after having taking cover on Bluff Cove Peak the day before.

By the end of May, D Squadron had secured Mount Kent at the cost of two wounded in Air Troop (Dick Palmer and Carl Rhodes) from small-arms fire with another SAS man having broken his hand taking cover during the engagement, and Boat Troop with Tactical HQ started patrolling Bluff Cove Peak, which they took with the loss of another two SAS wounded (Ewen Pearcy and Don Masters) hit by hand grenade splinters or rock fragments, including a Spanish-speaking Warrant officer attached from 23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve) who had joined Delves to interrogate any captured Argentines. At the same time, Captain Matthew Selfridge&#x27;s D Company scouting ahead of 3 PARA took Teal Inlet Settlement, at the cost of one wounded through an accidental discharge. The SAS soldiers claim coming under mortar bombardment while evacuating their wounded and the Royal Marines from 7 &#x27;Sphinx&#x27; Battery of the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery reported the loss of one gunner (Van Rooyen), who suffered a broken arm while taking cover among the rocks during the bombardment.

The rest of 42 Commando made a march across the hills north of Mount Simon to reinforce Mounts Kent and Challenger overlooking Port Stanley. The weather conditions were atrocious, with the Marines advancing through steep slippery hillocks and stone-runs to their objectives. Lou Armour was a corporal in J Company under Major Mike Norman:
Because of the weather and lack of equipment, we just had to carry all our heavy equipment back to Mount Kent, instead of being flown there. That was psychologically the toughest thing I&#x27;d ever done. You&#x27;re walking and falling, walking and falling—some of the lads carrying up to a hundred pounds—and if you fell over, it took two guys to lift you back up. Then there was the lack of sleep, the wet, the cold, the diarrhea.
The final attack was preceded by several days of observation and nights of patrolling. Some night-fighting patrols were part of a deception to convince the Argentines that the attack would come from a westerly direction. Other, more covert patrols were to find a route through a minefield around the south of Mount Harriet. Sniping and naval artillery were used to harass the defenders and deny them sleep.

On 3 June, Lieutenant Chris Marwood&#x27;s Reconnaissance Troop of 42 CDO on Mount Wall, accompanying the 3 Commando Brigade Forward Air Control team commanded by Flight Lieutenant Dennis Marshall-Hasdell, encountered two rifle sections from the 4th &quot;Monte Caseros&quot; Regiment (Second Lieutenant Lautaro Jiménez-Corbalán&#x27;s 3rd Platoon of B Company from Mount Harriet). The night before, the section under Corporal Elvio Alberto Balcaza had detected the presence of British troops on Wall, and the section under Corporal Nicolas Víctor Odorcic moved forward to assist under the cover of the early morning mist. However, at around 11.00 hours (local time) the Recce Troop opened fire and two conscripts (Privates Celso Paez and Roberto Ledesma) were instantly killed, and their NCO (Odorcic) went down, concussed when shot in the helmet by one of the Marine snipers.

This action drew attention to their exposed forward position, and Argentine reinforcements in the form of a rifle section under Corporal Walter Ariel Pintos from Second Lieutenant Marcelo Llambías Pravaz&#x27;s 3rd Platoon on Two Sisters joined the action with a counterattack firing rifle-grenades. The Primary Forward Air Controller, commando-trained Flight Lieutenant Dennis Marshal-Hasdell, remembers:

&quot;We were separated from our heavy bergens with the radios and all our gear. The patrol was spread over quite a large area, with lots of shouting, noise and firing going on. The Marines abandoned all their equipment, and although no one told us, it became clear that we were to withdraw. With no information and the likelihood of having to fight our way out, Dave Greedus and I decided to abandon our equipment, destroying as much as we could. The two radio sets (HF and UHF) were tough enough, but the HAZE unit of the laser target marker was designed to withstand the weight of a tank!&quot;

The Ferranti laser-target-designator retrieved in the contact showed that the Royal Marines were seeking to destroy the Argentine bunkers on Mount Harriet with 1,000-pound GBU-16 Paveway II dropped by RAF Harriers. The next day, Lieutenant Tony Hornby&#x27;s 10 (Defence) Troop re-occupied the Mount Wall observation post against no opposition. However, on the night of 5–6 June, Captain Andrés Ferrero&#x27;s 3rd Assault Section from 602 Commando Company attacked Lieutenant Hornby&#x27;s men on Mount Wall and the Royal Marines were forced to withdraw.

That same night (5-6 June), a British Gazelle helicopter, (no. XX377 of 656 Squadron) that was bringing forward communications equipment for the planed advance of the 5th Infantry Brigade in the form of the supporting 42 CDO through Harriet and Williams was shot down in a friendly fire incident by a Sea Dart missile launched by HMS Cardiff, all four men in the helicopter were killed.

As a reward for their efforts, the Argentine Land Forces Commander (Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre) who had been visiting the Commanding Officer of the 4th Regiment during the gun-battle on 3 June, ordered that the recently arrived boxes of chocolate bars from the Argentine hospital ship Bahía Paraiso to be distributed among the Mount Harriet defenders, regardless of rank.

==Initial actions==
On 8 June, the British troopships &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; and &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; were attacked by Argentine aircraft at Bluff Cove. Lieutenant-Colonel Diego Alejandro Soria sought permission to attack the British beachhead with the 4th Regiment, but his request was denied.

That day, reinforcements in the form of machine-gunners, mortarmen and protecting riflemen from the 1st &#x27;Patricios&#x27; Infantry Regiment, Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment arrived from Comodoro Rivadavia to support the 4th Infantry Regiment. On the night of 8–9 June, action on the outer defence zone flared when Lieutenant Mark Townsend&#x27;s 1 Troop (K Company, 42 CDO) probed Mount Harriet, killing two Argentines (Corporal Hipolito Gonzalez and Private Martiniano Gomez) from Second Lieutenant Jiménez-Corbalán&#x27;s 3rd Platoon. At the same time, two platoon-sized fighting patrols from 45 Commando attempted the same on Two Sisters Mountain, but the Argentine RASIT ground surveillance radar on Mount Longdon was able to detect the 45 Commando platoons, and artillery fire dispersed the British force. In all, Second Lieutenant Lautaro Jiménez-Corbalán would report the loss of 6 killed and 14 wounded fighting off Lieutenant Marwood&#x27;s Recce Troop on Mount Wall and the raid of Lieutenant Towsend&#x27;s 1 Troop, including losses suffered during the final British assault on Mount Harriet on the night of 11–12 June.

Around dusk on 9 June, Lieutenant-Colonel Soria&#x27;s men detected the presence of British troops who had taken up positions in Port Harriet House on the southern approaches to Mount Harriet. The 4th Regiment&#x27;s Reconnaissance Platoon, under Sub-Lieutenant Jorge Pasolli, received orders to move forward and clear &quot;at bayonet point if necessary&quot; the British from the farmhouse and the Scots Guards Reconnaissance Platoon that had moved into the area was forced to withdraw when the Argentine force, with Paratroop-trained First Lieutenant Francisco Pablo D&#x27;Aloia (adjutant of RI 4&#x27;s Commanding Officer) at the head, radioed fire support from the 120-mm Mortar Platoon dug in on Mount Harriet. Sub-Lieutenant Pasolli&#x27;s men attacked and the Scots Guards returned fire with two Bren machine guns but were forced to abandon their rucksacks and radios. As the Guardsmen retreated, under small arms and mortar fire, they sustained three wounded, including Sergeant Ian Allum.

On the night of 9–10 June, a rifle company from the 1st Battalion, 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles moved forward to conduct a raid against Mount William defenders. However, this strong night incursion was aborted and the planned fire support missions cancelled.

On the morning of 11 June, the orders for the attack were given to 42 CDO by Lieutenant Colonel Vaux. K Company was ordered to attack the eastern end of the mountain, while L Company would attack the southern side an hour later, where if the mountain was secured, would move North to occupy Goat Ridge. J Company would launch a diversionary attack (code-named Vesuvius) on the western end of Mount Harriet. If these objectives fell quickly, 42 CDO would proceed to capture Mount William.

In the closing hours of 11 June, K and L Companies moved from their assembly area on Mount Challenger (which lay to the west of Mount Harriet) and made their way south, around their objective, across the minefield, to their respective start lines. As they moved around the feature in the dark, J Company with supporting Welsh Guards launched a loud diversionary &quot;attack&quot; from the west.

==Battle==
The battle for Mount Harriet began on the evening of 11 June with a heavy naval softening-up bombardment that killed two Argentinians and wounded twenty-five.

John Witheroe, one of the British war correspondents, later recalled the heavy Royal Navy bombardment:

The Argentines retaliated and Captain Tomás Fox, the artillery observation officer on Mount Kent, directed 155 mm artillery rounds that fell among the men of &#x27;B&#x27; Company, 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles in the area of Bluff Cove, seriously wounding four Gurkhas, including Lance Corporal Gyanendra Rai, who nearly bled to death.

During the patrolling period, the Royal Marines had discovered a path through a minefield (possibly frozen) that Lieutenant Roberto Francisco Eito&#x27;s platoon of sappers from the 601st Combat Engineers Company had laid around Mount Harriet, allowing the 42 Commando rifle companies to attack the two Argentine 4th Regiment companies on Harriet from the rear.

Captain Peter Babbington&#x27;s K Company crossed their start line first and proceeded up the mountain undetected, knifing two sentries on the way. They remained undetected until they approached Sub-Lieutenant Mario Hector Juárez&#x27; 120 mm mortar platoon positions and decided to engage them. They were assisted in the advance by HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot;&#x27;s, artillery, and their own battalions mortars. During the engagement, Second Lieutenant Juárez was badly wounded firing his handgun in the dark and Corporal Laurence G Watts from K Company was killed clearing the occupants of a tent. The supporting British artillery batteries and mortar crews fired over 1,000 rounds to keep the Argentines pinned down, and helped stop the defenders getting a proper aim at the Royal Marines from K and L Companies.

About 150 metres from Soria&#x27;s HQ, Corporal Steve Newland circled behind a group of Argentines (under First Lieutenant Jorge Agustín Echeverría, the 4th Regiment&#x27;s intelligence officer) who along with ten men he had earlier on gathered from Sub-Lieutenant Eugenio César Bruny&#x27;s 2nd Rifle Platoon with the intent of making a local counterattack were now gathering retreating soldiers and setting up an ambush. Newland pulled back into cover and warned the lead elements in K Company. Each time a Royal Marine moved, Corporal Roberto Bacilio Baruzzo would open fire with the help of his night vision rifle scope, to make it appear there was only one enemy sniper holding up K Company. First Lieutenant Echeverría&#x27;s men were holding their fire in order to encourage the British to break cover and rush their position only to run into the concentrated fire of the machine-gun and protecting riflemen.
With half a platoon of RI4 and RI12 riflemen and a 7.62 mm general-purpose machine gun team threatening to blunt the British advance, Newland darted out from cover and charged the enemy. He neutralized the machine gun with grenades and killed three Argentine soldiers, but on reaching the rear of the position, Corporal Baruzzo shot Newland in both legs.

With the enemy machine gun out of action, Corporals Steve Newland, Mick Eccles and Chrystie &#x27;Sharky&#x27; Ward were able to clear the remaining Argentine troops and captured 17 Argentines, including Baruzzo and Echeverría with the Argentinian intelligence officer having been shot five times. The three British corporals were each awarded the Military Medal. Corporal Roberto Baruzzo was awarded the Medal of Valour in Combat.

Increasing numbers of Argentine soldiers, mainly shocked and dazed conscripts from RI 4&#x27;s Recce Platoon, Reserve Platoon and 120-mm Mortar Platoon began to surrender but several experienced officers (First Lieutenants Francisco Pablo D&#x27;Aloia, Esteban Guillermo Carlucci, Luis Oscar García and Sub-Lieutenants Jorge Pasolli and Edgardo Duarte-Lachnight)as well as the senior NCOs (including the Regimental Sergeant-Major Miguel Angel Cáceres) fought on, in accordance to their orders. The RI 4 Commanding Officer and the medical officer First Lieutenant Rubén Cichiara, covered by the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers machine-gun detachment under Sergeant Jorge Alberto Rivero, linked up with B Company and ordered Arroyo&#x27;s men to counterattack. The heavy machine gun teams and protecting riflemen, in general, remained at their positions continuing the fight.

Captain David Wheen&#x27;s L Company crossed their start line shortly after K Company and were almost immediately engaged by machine-gun fire from Sub-Lieutenant Pablo Oliva&#x27;s platoon of conscripts defending the lower southern slopes. There were several casualties from this fire, including Lieutenant Ian Stafford the only Argyll and Sutherland Highlander in the campaign who was on exchange as L Company&#x27;s second -in-command and was shot in the leg. Kim Sabido, the IRN reporter with L Company, reported stiff Argentine resistance:

The weapons in Oliva&#x27;s platoon would not be silenced until being hit by several MILAN anti-tank missiles and the supporting 105mm artillery guns from Mount Challenger, with Oliva reporting the loss of 3 men killed (Sergeant Héctor Montellano, Corporal Oscar Labalta and Private Juan Raúl Serradori) and 14 wounded (including the platoon sergeant, Ramón Antonio Barrios and Corporals Héctor Adán Pereyra and Carlos Alberto López) in his platoon. L Company Marines took 5 hours to advance 600 metres in the face of reinforcements in the form of Sub-Lieutenant Bruny&#x27;s RI 4 Platoon and contend they took fire from at least seven machine guns and protecting rifle teams that wounded five men, including the company&#x27;s second-in-command and his signaller. British military historian Hugh Bicheno reports that the 4th Regiment&#x27;s passive night goggles were all with Arroyo&#x27;s B Company. Another 11 Marines in Wheen&#x27;s Company were wounded by Argentine shellfire that Lieutenant-Colonel Soria personally brought down attempting to halt the British advance. One of the attacking Royal Marines, Geoff Power, remembers:

Before first light, Lieutenant Jerry Burnell&#x27;s 5 Troop of L Company proceeded to an outcrop of rocks towards Goat Ridge. As they advanced, the Royal Marine platoon came under fire from Second Lieutenant Jiménez-Corbalán 3rd Platoon, covering the Argentine retreat and were forced to withdraw under cover of the machine guns pre-positioned behind and further up the hill. The Troop took one casualty in this action. L Company requested mortar fire onto the Argentines; a mixture of High explosive (HE) and White phosphorus (WP); then 5 Troop moved forward supported by the 15 machine-guns positioned on the ridge. They took 3 prisoners although most of Jiménez-Corbalán men had withdrawn after losing two killed in the night fighting (Privates Juan José Acuña and Carlos Epifanio Casco). The platoon of Oscar Augusto Silva continued to resist from Goat Ridge in the early morning light and a determined conscript (Orlando Aylan), in a position just below the summit of Mount Harriet held up L Company with accurate shooting until killed by an 84mm anti-tank rocket fired at short range. 5 Troop continued their advance across open ground towards Goat Ridge but came under fire and withdrew into the cover of rocks. British artillery bombarded Silva&#x27;s platoon and Lima Company was able to resume the advance in the form of 4 Troop and captured Goat Ridge after Silva&#x27;s men had withdrawn.

At some time in the early morning darkness, Second Lieutenant Jiménez-Corbalán&#x27;s 3rd platoon were making their way to new positions on Mount William, the officer was concussed and temporarily blinded when he set off an Argentine booby-trap while leading his men through a minefield. At great risk to themselves, his radio operator Privates Teodoro Flores and Carlos Salvatierra rescued their platoon commander and were decorated for their bravery.

==Aftermath==
The battle was an example of good planning, use of deception and surprise and was a further step towards the main objective of Stanley. Two Royal Marines, Corporal Laurence George Watts and Corporal Jeremy Smith were killed, and thirty were wounded, including fourteen in L Company. Another seven Scots Guards and Gurkhas were wounded by Argentine artillery and mortar fire controllers on Mount Harriet. A supporting British Gazelle helicopter had also been lost in a friendly-fire incident early on 6 June, killing both pilots and two signallers. On 13 June, a Welsh Guards messenger (Lance Corporal Chris Thomas), bringing forward food supplies to Major Christopher Drewrywe&#x27;s Number 2 Company (1WG), via Mount Harriet&#x27;s lower slopes was killed when his motorbike ran over a mine or was hit by mortar fire.

Eighteen Argentines were killed defending Mount Harriet, including those killed in earlier patrol battles and shelling. The night battle had lasted longer than expected, leaving no time for 42 Commando to capture Mount William under the cover of darkness as had been planned. Lance Corporal Tony Koleszar had the surprising experience of finding that two &#x27;dead&#x27; Argentine soldiers, whose boots he was trying to remove, were very much alive and jumped up to surrender.

Some British reporters were thus misled into depicting the Argentineans as hapless teenage conscripts who caved in after the first shots were fired, but Royal Marine Warrant Officer 2 John Cartledge, who served with L Company during the battle, corrected them, saying the Argentines were good soldiers who had fought properly:They used the tactics which they had been taught along the way very well, they were quite prepared for an attack. They put up a strong fight from start to finish. They were also better equipped than we were. We had first-generation night sights, which were large cumbersome pieces of equipment, while the Argentines had second-generation American night sights that were compact and so much better than what we had. The one deficiency which we exposed was that they had planned for a western end of the mountain attack and therefore had not bothered to extend their defensive positions to the eastern end, where we ultimately attacked.

The 4th Infantry Regiment had taken up positions on Mount Harriet and Two Sisters Mountain on 1 June. Their small individual Lineman entrenching tools were all broken by the time they took over their new defensive-line after having constructed solid positions on Mount Challenger and Wall Mountain during May, as the Argentinian Regimental Commander explained to British military historian Martin Middlebrook.

One British general put their success down to his Marines&#x27; skill and professionalism:What was needed was speed but not being bloody stupid. The Israelis would have done it much faster but with many more casualties.

42 Commando captured 300 prisoners on Mount Harriet, and for the bravery shown in the attack, Lieutenant Colonel Nick Vaux was awarded a Distinguished Service Order, Captain Babbington of K Coy a Military Cross, Sergeant Collins, Corporals; Eccles, Newland and Ward, also of K Coy were each awarded Military Medals. Eight men were Mentioned in dispatches.

After the battle, Corporal Krishnakumar Raiof the Queens Gurkha Engineers would be killed whilst engaged in clearing the minefield and booby-traps that the Argentine Marines had laid in nearby Goat Ridge, the same explosives that had injured Sub-Lieutenant Jiménez-Corbalán as he made his way to William with his men from Harriet.

In 2017, David Wheen travelled to Argentina to meet Lautaro Jiménez-Corbalán, in an act of reconciliation, Wheen presented Jiménez-Corbalán with a British military essay and painting of the battle and received in return, a copy of his book &quot;Malvinas en Primera Línea&quot; (Falklands on the Front Line), recounting the experiences of the 4th Regiment in the Falklands.

In 2019, Marine Andy Damstag from L Company who dragged Corporal Héctor Pereyra into the cover of rocks during the British attack and spent the next two hours looking after the wounded Argentine NCO, offering him sweets and cigarettes, contacted him and returned his helmet that he had kept as a souvenir with the help of the Argentine Embassy in London.

<doc id="526397" wikidata="Q836915" url="?curid=526397" title="Free state (polity)">
<text>Free state is a term occasionally used in the official titles of some states throughout the world with varying meanings depending on the context. In principle, the title asserts and emphasises a particular freedom of the state in question, but this is not always reflected in practice. Some states use the title to assert sovereignty or independence from foreign domination, while others have used it to assert autonomy within a larger nation-state. Sometimes &quot;free state&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;republic&quot;.

The republican sense of the term derives from &quot;libera res publica&quot; (literally, &quot;the free public thing/affair&quot;), a term used by Latin historians for the period of the Roman Republic, though not all &quot;free states&quot; have been republics. The historical German free states and the Orange Free State of Southern Africa were republican in form, while the Congo Free State and Irish Free State were governed under forms of monarchy.

==Overview==
===Republican England===
English Parliament, in the act forming the Commonwealth of England of 1649 to 1660, declared that &quot;England is confirmed to be a Commonwealth and Free State and shall from henceforth be Governed as a Commonwealth and Free State.&quot; The Commonwealth had a republican constitution.

===Germany===

In Germany, the term &quot;free state&quot; (in German, &quot;Freistaat&quot; ) comes from the 19th century as a German word for &quot;republic&quot;. After the German Revolution of November 1918, when Imperial Germany became a democratic republic, most of the German states within the German Reich called themselves a Free State. Others used expressions like &quot;Republik&quot; or &quot;Volksstaat&quot; (people&#x27;s state) – though unpopular, as that term was associated with the enemy France. According to the Versailles Treaty, Danzig was split off from Germany in 1919, becoming the Free City of Danzig.

After the Nazis came to power, they abolished the concept of a federal republic and all the states and re-organized Germany into &quot;Gaue&quot;, with appointed leadership.

The states were re-established within the reduced German borders after World War II; however, from 1952 only Bavaria (successor (but not de jure) to the Kingdom of Bavaria) still called itself a Free State and that made &quot;Freistaat&quot; a synonym for Bavaria. After the reunification, the reestablished Saxony (successor (but not de jure) to the Kingdom of Saxony) used the name again in 1992 and Thuringia began to use it for the first time in 1993.

====Free Cities====
Historically, Germany had Imperial Free Cities, who were subject only to the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1871 Germany knew three Free Cities, Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck; the last lost its status in 1937. Since 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany has Hamburg (&quot;Freie und Hansestadt&quot;, Free and Hanseatic City) and Bremen (&quot;Freie Hansestadt&quot;), as well as Berlin, as a city which is also a state. Like the Free States these three cities have no special rights in the federation.

===Africa===

In South Africa, the term &quot;free state&quot; was used in the title of the nineteenth century Orange Free State (&quot;Oranje Vrystaat&quot; in Afrikaans) and is today used in the title of its successor, Free State; both entities were established as republican in form.

In contrast, the Congo Free State came into being between 1877 and 1884 as a private kingdom or dictatorship of King Leopold II of Belgium. In this case, the term &quot;free&quot; emphasised the new state&#x27;s freedom from major colonial powers and the Belgian parliament, as the colony was ruled only by the king.

===Irish Free State===

The Irish Free State of 1922–1937 was a dominion of the British Empire. The term &quot;free state&quot; was deliberately chosen as a literal translation of the Irish word &quot;saorstát&quot;. At the time in which Irish nationalist leaders (who generally favoured a republican form of government) were negotiating the secession of most of Ireland from the United Kingdom, the word &quot;saorstát&quot; was a commonly used Irish-language word for &quot;republic&quot;. The British government was opposed to the Free State being established as a republic (which would mean severing Ireland&#x27;s links with the British Crown) and so insisted that the literal translation of &quot;saorstát&quot; be used in the new state&#x27;s English title instead. The term &quot;saorstát&quot; thus represented a compromise in terminology: British officials could accept it as a less explicit rejection of Ireland&#x27;s links to the Crown than the term &quot;republic&quot; itself, while Irish republicans could choose to interpret it as signifying a republic by any other name.

===Puerto Rico===

The official Spanish name of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is &quot;Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico&quot;, literally, &quot;Associated Free State of Puerto Rico&quot;, expressing a &quot;politically organized community” or “State,” which is simultaneously connected by a compact to a larger political system and hence does not have an independent and separate status. However, according to the United States Supreme Court, Puerto Rico is not free or associated; it is only a state in the general sense, not as a state of the Union in the U.S. constitutional sense. According to consistent U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, Puerto Rico belongs to but is not an integral part (Organized incorporated territory) of the United States. Moreover, the said jurisprudence has determined that regardless of what nominal or cosmetic veneer has moted Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status, it is essentially a U.S. colonial territory, since it is under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress. At its most basic, this Supreme Court doctrine expresses that Puerto Rico is more like property, far from a free-governing community or nation, and thus &quot;domestic in a foreign sense&quot; (not for the taking or meddling by free foreign nations), but &quot;foreign in a domestic sense&quot; (not a partner or an equal). In the Insular Cases, the Court ruled that the United States Constitution does not automatically apply in Puerto Rico.

<doc id="526399" wikidata="Q211853" url="?curid=526399" title="Republic of Serbian Krajina">
<text>The Republic of Serbian Krajina or Serb Republic of Krajina ( / or РСК / RSK, ), known as the Serbian Krajina ( / ) or simply Krajina, was a self-proclaimed Serb proto-state, a territory within the newly independent Republic of Croatia (formerly part of Socialist Yugoslavia), which it defied, and which was active during the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95). It was not recognized internationally. The name &quot;Krajina&quot; (&quot;Frontier&quot;) was adopted from the historical Military Frontier of the Habsburg monarchy (Austria-Hungary), which had a substantial Serb population and existed up to the late 19th century. The RSK government waged a war for ethnic Serb independence from Croatia and unification with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Republika Srpska (in Bosnia and Herzegovina).

The government of Krajina had &quot;de facto&quot; control over central parts of the territory while control of the outskirts changed with the successes and failures of its military activities. The territory was legally protected by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).

Its main portion was overrun by Croatian forces in 1995 and the Republic of Serbian Krajina was ultimately disbanded as a result; a rump remained in eastern Slavonia under UNTAES administration until its peaceful reintegration into Croatia in 1998 under the Erdut Agreement.

The name &quot;Krajina&quot; (meaning &quot;frontier&quot;) stemmed from the Military Frontier which the Habsburg monarchy carved out of parts of the crown lands of Croatia and Slavonia between 1553 and 1578 with a view to defending itself against the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The population was mainly Croats, Serbs and Vlachs who immigrated from nearby parts of the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Bosnia and Serbia) into the region and helped bolster and replenish the population as well as the garrisoned troops in the fight against the Ottomans. The Austrians controlled the Frontier from military headquarters in Vienna and did not make it a crown land, though it had some special rights in order to encourage settlement in an otherwise deserted, war-ravaged territory. The abolition of the military rule took place between 1869 and 1871. In order to attract Serbs to become part of Croatia, on 11 May 1867, the Sabor solemnly declared that &quot;the Triune Kingdom recognizes the Serbs living in it as a nation identical and equal with the Croatian nation&quot;. Subsequently, the Military Frontier was incorporated into Habsburg Croatia on 1 August 1881 when the Ban of Croatia Ladislav Pejačević took over from the Zagreb General Command.

Following the end of World War I in 1918, the regions formerly forming part of the Military Frontier came under the control of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where they formed part of the Sava Banovina, along with most of the old Croatia-Slavonia. Between the two World Wars, the Serbs of the Croatian and Slavonian Krajina, as well as those of the Bosnian Krajina and of other regions west of Serbia, organized a notable political party, the Independent Democratic Party under Svetozar Pribićević. In the new state there existed much tension between the Croats and Serbs over differing political visions, with the campaign for Croatian autonomy culminating in the assassination of a Croatian leader, Stjepan Radić, in the parliament, and repression by the Serb-dominated security structures.

Between 1939 and 1941, in an attempt to resolve the Croat-Serb political and social antagonism in first Yugoslavia, the Kingdom established an autonomous Banovina of Croatia incorporating (amongst other territories) much of the former Military Frontier as well as parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1941, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia and in the aftermath the Independent State of Croatia (which included the whole of today&#x27;s Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Serbia (Eastern Syrmia) as well) was declared. The Germans installed the Ustaše (who had allegedly plotted the assassination of the Serbian King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1934) as rulers of the new country; the Ustaše authorities promptly pursued a genocidal policy of persecution of Serbs, Jews and Croats (from opposition groups), leading to the deaths of over 300,000. During this period, individual Croats coalesced around the ruling authorities or around the communist anti-fascist Partisans. Serbs from around the Knin area tended to join the Chetniks, whilst Serbs from the Banovina and Slavonia regions tended to join the Partisans. Various Chetnik groups also committed atrocities against Croats across many areas of Lika and parts of northern Dalmatia.

At the end of World War II in 1945, the communist-dominated Partisans prevailed and the Krajina region became part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia until 7 April 1963, when the federal republic changed its name to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Josip Broz Tito suppressed the autonomous political organizations of the region (along with other movements such as the Croatian Spring); however, the Yugoslav constitutions of 1965 and 1974 did give substantial rights to national minorities - including to the Serbs in SR Croatia.

The Serbian &quot;Krajina&quot; entity to emerge upon Croatia&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1991 would include three kinds of territories:

* a large section of the historical Military Frontier, in areas with a majority Serbian population;
* areas such as parts of northern Dalmatia, that never formed part of the Frontier but had a majority or a plurality of Serbian population, including the self-proclaimed entity&#x27;s capital, Knin;
* areas that bordered with Serbia and where Serbs formed a significant minority (Baranya, Vukovar).

Large sections of the historical Military Frontier lay outside of the Republic of Serbian Krajina and contained a largely Croat population - these including much of Lika, the area centered around the city of Bjelovar, central and south-eastern Slavonia.

==Creation==
 
The Serb-populated regions in Croatia were of central concern to the Serbian nationalist movement of the late 1980s, led by Slobodan Milošević. In September 1986 the Serbian Academy&#x27;s memorandum on the status of Serbia and Serbs was partially leaked by a Serbian newspaper. It listed a series of grievances against the Yugoslav federation, claiming that the situation in Kosovo was genocide, and complained about alleged discrimination of Serbs at the hands of the Croatian authorities. Among the claims that it makes is that &#x27;except for the time under the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbs in Croatia have never been as jeopardized as they are today&#x27;. Tension was further fueled by the overthrow of Vojvodina and Montenegro&#x27;s government by Milošević&#x27;s loyalists, and the abrogation of Kosovo&#x27;s and Vojvodina&#x27;s autonomy in 1989, which gave Milošević 4 out of 8 votes on the Yugoslav Federal Presidency, thus gaining the power to block every decision made by the Presidency. Furthermore, a series of Serb nationalist rallies were held in Croatia during 1989, under pressure from Serbia. On 8 July 1989, a large nationalist rally was held in Knin, during which banners threatening JNA intervention in Croatia, as well as Chetnik iconography was displayed. The Croatian pro-independence party victory in 1990 made matters more tense, especially since the country&#x27;s Serb minority was supported by Milošević. At the time, Serbs comprised about 12.2% (581,663 people) of Croatia&#x27;s population (1991 census).

Serbs became increasingly opposed to the policies of Franjo Tuđman, elected president of Croatia in April 1990, due to his overt desire for the creation of an independent Croatia. On 30 May 1990, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) of Jovan Rašković broke all ties to the Croatian parliament. The following June in Knin, the SDS-led Serbs proclaimed the creation of the Association of Municipalities of Northern Dalmatia and Lika. In August 1990, the Serbs began what became known as the Log Revolution, where barricades of logs were placed across roads throughout the South as an expression of their secession from Croatia. This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating the coastal region of Dalmatia from the rest of the country. The Constitution of Croatia was passed in December 1990, which reduced the status of Serbs from &quot;constituent&quot; to a &quot;national minority&quot; in the same category as other groups such as Italians and Hungarians. Some would later justify their claim to an independent Serb state by arguing that the new constitution contradicted the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, because, in their view, Croatia was still legally governed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, although this ignores the fact that Serbia&#x27;s constitution, promulgated three months before Croatia&#x27;s, also contained several provisions violating the 1974 Federal Constitution.

Serbs in Croatia had established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian independence. Their position was that if Croatia could secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia. Milan Babić, a dentist by profession from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. At his ICTY trial in 2004, he claimed that &quot;during the events [of 1990–1992], and in particular at the beginning of his political career, he was strongly influenced and misled by Serbian propaganda, which repeatedly referred to the imminent threat of a Croatian genocide perpetrated on the Serbs in Croatia, thus creating an atmosphere of hatred and fear of Croats.&quot; The rebel Croatian Serbs established a number of paramilitary militia units under the leadership of Milan Martić, the police chief in Knin.

In August 1990, a referendum was held in Krajina on the question of Serb &quot;sovereignty and autonomy&quot; in Croatia. The resolution was confined exclusively to Serbs so it passed by an improbable majority of 99.7%. As expected, it was declared illegal and invalid by the Croatian government, who stated that Serbs had no constitutional right to break away from Croatian legal territory - as well as no right to limit the franchise to one ethnic group.

Babić&#x27;s administration announced the creation of a Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (or &quot;SAO Krajina&quot;) on 21 December 1990. On 16 March 1991, another referendum was held which asked: &quot;Are you in favor of the SAO Krajina joining the Republic of Serbia and staying in Yugoslavia with Serbia, Montenegro and others who wish to preserve Yugoslavia?&quot;. With 99.8% voting in favor, the referendum was approved and the Krajina assembly declared that &quot;the territory of the SAO Krajina is a constitutive part of the unified state territory of the Republic of Serbia&quot;. On 1 April 1991, it declared that it would secede from Croatia. Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased paying taxes to the Zagreb government, and began implementing its own currency system, army regiments, and postal service.

Croatia held a referendum on independence on 19 May 1991, in which the electorate—minus many Serbs, who chose to boycott it—voted overwhelmingly for independence with the option of confederate union with other Yugoslav states - with 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum by 93 percent. On 25 June 1991, Croatia and Slovenia both declared their independence from Yugoslavia. As the JNA attempted unsuccessfully to suppress Slovenia&#x27;s independence in the short Slovenian War, clashes between revolting Croatian Serbs and Croatian security forces broke out almost immediately, leaving dozens dead on both sides. Serbs were supported by remnants of the JNA (whose members were now only from Serbia and Montenegro), which provided them weapons. Many Croatians fled their homes in fear or were forced out by the rebel Serbs. The European Union and United Nations unsuccessfully attempted to broker ceasefires and peace settlements.
Around August 1991, the leaders of Serbian Krajina and Serbia allegedly agreed to embark on a campaign which the ICTY prosecutors described as a &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; whose purpose &quot;was the forcible removal of the majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia, an area he planned to become part of a new Serb-dominated state.&quot; According to testimony given by Milan Babić in his subsequent war crimes trial, during the summer of 1991, the Serbian secret police (under Milošević&#x27;s command) set up &quot;a parallel structure of state security and the police of Krajina and units commanded by the state security of Serbia&quot;. Paramilitary groups such as the Wolves of Vučjak and White Eagles, funded by the Serbian secret police, were also a key component of this structure.

A wider-scale war was launched in August 1991. Over the following months, a large area of territory, amounting to a third of Croatia, was controlled by the rebel Serbs. The Croatian population suffered heavily, fleeing or evicted with numerous killings, leading to ethnic cleansing. The bulk of the fighting occurred between August and December 1991 when approximately 80,000 Croats were expelled (and some were killed). Many more died and or were displaced in fighting in eastern Slavonia (this territory along the Croatian/Serbian border was not part of the Krajina, and it was the JNA that was the principal actor in that part of the conflict). The total number of exiled Croats and other non-Serbs range from 170,000 (ICTY) up to a quarter of a million people (Human Rights Watch).

In the latter half of 1991, Croatia was beginning to form an army and their main defenders, the local police, were overpowered by the JNA military who supported rebelled Croatian Serbs. The RSK was located entirely inland, but they soon started advancing deeper into Croatian territory. Among other places, they shelled the Croatian coastal town of Zadar killing over 80 people in nearby areas and damaging the Maslenica Bridge that connected northern and southern Croatia, in the Operation Coast-91. They also tried to overtake Šibenik, but the defenders successfully repelled the attack by JNA, in the Battle of Šibenik. The main city theatre was also bombed by JNA forces. The city of Vukovar, however, was completely devastated by JNA attacks. The city of Vukovar that warded off JNA attacks for months eventually fell, ending the Battle of Vukovar. 2,000 defenders of Vukovar and civilians were killed, 800 went missing and 22,000 were forced into exile. The wounded were taken from Vukovar Hospital to Ovčara near Vukovar where they were executed.

==Formal proclamations==
On 19 December 1991, the SAO Krajina proclaimed itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Constitution of Serbian Krajina came into effect the same day. On 26 February 1992, the SAO Western Slavonia and SAO Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia were added to the RSK, which initially had only encompassed the territories within the SAO Krajina. The Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (Srpska Vojska Krajine, SVK) was officially formed on 19 March 1992. The RSK occupied an area of some 17,028 km2 at its greatest extent.

==1992 ceasefire==

Under the Vance plan, signed in November 1991, Presidents Tuđman and Milošević agreed to a United Nations peace plan put forward by Cyrus Vance.
A final ceasefire agreement, the Sarajevo Agreement, was signed by representatives of the two sides in January 1992, paving the way for the implementation of the Vance plan. Four United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) were established in Croatian territory which was claimed by RSK, and the plan called for the withdrawal of the JNA from Croatia and for the return of refugees to their homes in the UNPAs.

The JNA officially withdrew from Croatia in May 1992 but much of its weaponry and many of its personnel remained in the Serb-held areas and were turned over to the RSK&#x27;s security forces. Refugees were not allowed to return to their homes and many of the remaining Croats and other nationalities left in the RSK were expelled or killed in the following months. On 21 February 1992, the creation of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was authorised by the UN Security Council for an initial period of a year, to provide security to the UNPAs.

The agreement effectively froze the front lines for the next three years. Croatia and the RSK had effectively fought each other to a standstill. The Republic of Serbian Krajina was not recognized &quot;de jure&quot; by any other country or international organization. Nevertheless, it gained support from Serbia&#x27;s allies, like Russia.

==After the ceasefire==
UNPROFOR was deployed throughout the region to maintain the ceasefire, although in practice its light armament and restricted rules of engagement meant that it was little more than an observer force. It proved wholly unable to ensure that refugees returned to the RSK. Indeed, the rebel Croatian Serb authorities continued to make efforts to ensure that they could &quot;never&quot; return, destroying villages and cultural and religious monuments to erase the previous existence of the Croatian inhabitants of the Krajina. Milan Babić later testified that this policy was driven from Belgrade through the Serbian secret police—and ultimately Milošević—who he claimed was in control of all the administrative institutions and armed forces in the Krajina. This would certainly explain why the Yugoslav National Army took the side of the rebelled Croatian Serbs in spite of its claims to be acting as a &quot;peacekeeping&quot; force. Milošević denied this, claiming that Babić had made it up &quot;out of fear&quot;.

The Army of Serbian Krajina frequently attacked neighboring Bihać enclave (then in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) with heavy artillery.
With the creation of new Croatian counties on 30 December 1992, the Croatian government also set aside two autonomous regions (&quot;kotar&quot;) for ethnic Serbs in the areas of Krajina:
* Autonomous District of Glina (, )
** Municipalities &quot;de jure&quot; within the Autonomous District of Glina were Glina, Vrginmost, Hrvatska Kostajnica, Dvor and Vojnić.
* Autonomous District of Knin (, )

However, Serbs considered this too late, as it was not the amount of autonomy they wanted, and by now they had declared &quot;de facto&quot; independence.

The districts never actually functioned since they were located within the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. The existence of the Autonomous District of Glina was also provided in the draft of the Z-4 plan, that was rejected.
After Operation Storm, the application of the law which allowed autonomy would be temporarily suspended. In 2000 this part of the law was formally repealed.

==Decline==

The partial implementation of the Vance Plan drove a wedge between the governments of the RSK and Serbia, the RSK&#x27;s principal backer and supplier of fuel, arms, and money. Milan Babić strongly opposed the Vance Plan but was overruled by the RSK&#x27;s assembly.

On 26 February 1992, Babić was deposed and replaced as President of the RSK by Goran Hadžić, a Milošević loyalist. Babić remained involved in RSK politics but as a considerably weaker figure.

The position of the RSK eroded steadily over the following three years. On the surface, the RSK had all the trappings of a state: army, parliament, president, government and ministries, currency and stamps. However, its economy was wholly dependent on support from the rump Yugoslavia, which had the effect of importing that country&#x27;s hyperinflation.

The economic situation soon became disastrous. By 1994, only 36,000 of the RSK&#x27;s 430,000 citizens were employed. The war had severed the RSK&#x27;s trade links with the rest of Croatia, leaving its few industries idle. With few natural resources of its own, it had to import most of the goods and fuel it required. Agriculture was devastated, and operated at little more than a subsistence level. Professionals went to Serbia or elsewhere to escape the republic&#x27;s economic hardships. To make matters worse, the RSK&#x27;s government was grossly corrupt and the region became a haven for black marketeering and other criminal activity. It was clear by the mid-1990s that without a peace deal or support from Yugoslavia the RSK was not economically viable. This was especially evident in Belgrade, where the RSK had become an unwanted economic and political burden for Milošević. Much to his frustration, the rebel Croatian Serbs rebuffed his government&#x27;s demands to settle the conflict. 
In July 1992 the RSK issued its own currency, the Krajina dinar (HRKR), in parallel with the Yugoslav dinar. This was followed by the &quot;October dinar&quot; (HRKO), first issued on 1 October 1993 and equal to 1,000,000 Reformed Dinar, and the &quot;1994 dinar&quot;, first issued on 1 January 1994, and equal to 1,000,000,000 October dinar.
The RSK&#x27;s weakness also adversely affected its armed forces, the Vojska Srpske Krajine (VSK). Since the 1992 ceasefire agreement, Croatia had spent heavily on importing weapons and training its armed forces with assistance from American contractors. In contrast, the VSK had grown steadily weaker, with its soldiers poorly motivated, trained and equipped. There were only about 55,000 of them to cover a front of some 600 km in Croatia plus 100 km along the border with the Bihać pocket in Bosnia. With 16,000 stationed in eastern Slavonia, only about 39,000 were left to defend the main part of the RSK. Overall, only 30,000 were capable of full mobilization, yet they faced a far stronger Croatian army. Also, political divisions between Hadžić and Babić occasionally led to physical and sometimes even armed confrontations between their supporters; Babić himself was assaulted and beaten in an incident in Benkovac.

In January 1993 the revitalized Croatian army attacked the Serbian positions around Maslenica in southern Croatia which curtailed their access to the sea via Novigrad.

In mid-1993, the RSK authorities started a campaign to formally create a United Serbian Republic.

In a second offensive in mid-September 1993, the Croatian army overran the Medak pocket in southern Krajina in a push to regain Serb-held Croatian territory. The rebel Croatian Serbs brought reinforcements forward fairly quickly, but the strength of the Croatian forces proved superior. The Croatian offensive was halted by a combination of a battalion of Canadian peacekeepers from the second battalion of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) reinforced by a Company of French peacekeepers, combined with international diplomacy. Hadžić sent an urgent request to Belgrade for reinforcements, arms, and equipment. In response, around 4,000 paramilitaries under the command of Vojislav Šešelj (the White Eagles) and &quot;Arkan&quot; (the Serb Volunteer Guard) arrived to bolster the VSK.

General elections were held in the RSK on 12 December 1993, with a second round of the presidential election on 23 January 1994. Martić received 54,000 fewer votes than Babić in the first round, but went on to win the second round with 104,234 votes.

== Operation Flash and Storm ==

Following the rejection by both sides of the Z-4 plan for reintegration, the RSK&#x27;s end came in 1995, when Croatian forces gained control of SAO Western Slavonia in Operation Flash (May) followed by the biggest part of occupied Croatia in Operation Storm (August). The Krajina Serb Supreme Defence Council met under president Milan Martić to discuss the situation. A decision was reached at 16:45 to &quot;start evacuating the population unfit for military service from the municipalities of Knin, Benkovac, Obrovac, Drniš and Gračac.&quot; The RSK was disbanded and most of its Serb population (from 150,000 to 200,000 people) fled. Only 5,000 to 6,000 people remained, mostly the elderly. Croatian historian Ivo Goldstein wrote, &quot;The reasons for the Serb exodus are complex. Some had to leave because the Serb army had forced them to, while others feared the revenge of the Croatian army or of their former Croat neighbors, whom they had driven away and whose homes they had mostly looted (and it was later shown that this fear was far from groundless)&quot;.
Most of the refugees fled to today&#x27;s Serbia, Bosnia, and eastern Slavonia. Some of those who refused to leave were murdered, tortured and forcibly expelled by the Croatian Army and police.

==Later events==
The parts of the former RSK in eastern Croatia (along with the Danube) remained in place, in what was previously the SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.

In 1995, Milan Milanović, formerly a Republic of Serbian Krajina official, signed the Erdut Agreement as a representative of the Serbian side. This agreement, co-signed by the representative of the Croatian Government, was sponsored by the United Nations, and it set up a transitional period during which the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) peacekeeping mission would oversee a peaceful reintegration of this territory into Croatia, starting on 15 January 1996. In 1998, the UNTAES mission was complete and the territory was formally returned to Croatia. Based on the Erdut Agreement, the Joint Council of Municipalities was established in the region in 1997.

After the peaceful reintegration, two Croatian islands on the Danube, the Island of Šarengrad and the Island of Vukovar, remained under Serbian military control. In 2004, the Serbian military was withdrawn from the islands and replaced with Serbian police. The islands remain an open question as the Croatian side insists on applying Badinter Arbitration Committee decisions.

In 1995 a Croatian court sentenced former RSK president Goran Hadžić &quot;in absentia&quot; to 20 years in prison for rocket attacks on Šibenik and Vodice. In 1999 he was sentenced to an additional 20 years for war crimes in Tenja, near Osijek, and in 2002 Croatia&#x27;s state attorney brought another indictment against him for the murder of almost 1,300 Croats in Vukovar, Osijek, Vinkovci, Županja and elsewhere. On 4 June 2004, the ICTY indicted him on 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In 2011 he was arrested and extradited to the Hague, where his initial trial hearing was held on 25 July the same year. In 2014 he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer; he died two years later at the age of 57. The ICTY trial was terminated upon his death.

Former RSK president Milan Babić was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2004 and was the first ever indictee to plead guilty and enter a plea bargain with the prosecution, after which he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was charged with five counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war. After he was sentenced in 2004, Babić was found dead in his prison cell in The Hague in March 2006, in an apparent suicide.

Former RSK president Milan Martić was indicted for war crimes by the ICTY in 2005 was convicted of war crimes on 12 June 2007 and sentenced to 35 years in prison where he was transferred to in 2009. He is serving his sentence in Estonia. According to the ICTY, in the amended indictment, he &quot;helped organize an ethnic cleansing campaign of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina and virtually the entire non-Serb population was forcibly removed, deported or killed&quot;.

Between 2001 and 2012, the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markač and Ivan Čermak in the Trial of Gotovina et al for their involvement in crimes committed during and in the aftermath of Operation Storm. The indictment and the subsequent trial on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war described several killings, widespread arson and looting committed by Croatian soldiers. In April 2011, Gotovina and Markač were convicted and given prison sentences, while Čermak was acquitted. Gotovina and Markač appealed the verdict and in November 2012 the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY overturned their convictions, acquitting them. Both of them were accused of being part of the &quot;criminal enterprise&quot; but the Court concluded there was no such conspiracy.

After the war, a number of towns and municipalities that had comprised the RSK were designated Areas of Special State Concern.

==Demographics==
According to the indictment of prosecutor Carla Del Ponte against Slobodan Milošević at the ICTY, the Croat and non-Serb population from the 1991 census was approximately as follows:
Thus Serbs comprised 52.3% and Croats 35.8% of the population of SAO Krajina respectively in 1991.

According to data set forth at the meeting of the Government of the RSK in July 1992, its ethnic composition was 88% Serbs, 7% Croats, 5% others. As of November 1993, less than 400 ethnic Croats still resided in UNPA Sector South, and between 1,500 and 2,000 remained in UNPA Sector North.

==Status==
Serbian Krajina has been described as a &quot;proto-state&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Legal status===
During its existence, this entity did not achieve international recognition. On 29 November 1991, the Badinter commission concluded that Yugoslavia was &quot;in dissolution&quot; and that the republics – including Croatia – should be recognized as independent states when they asked so. They also assigned these republics territorial integrity. For most of the world, this was a reason to recognize Croatia. However, Serbia did not accept the conclusions of the commission in that period and recognized Croatia only after Croatian military actions (Oluja and Bljesak) and the Dayton agreement.

On 20 November 1991 Lord Carrington asked Badinter commission: &quot;Does the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have the right to self-determination?&quot; The commission concluded on 11 January 1992 &quot;that the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is entitled to all the rights concerned to minorities and ethnic groups[...]&quot; and &quot;that the Republics must afford the members of those minorities and ethnic groups all the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized in international law, including, where appropriate, the right to choose their nationality&quot;.
===Support and funding===
Milan Babić, former President of Serbian Krajina, testified to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) that Krajina was provided with weapons by Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s government in Serbia, and that Krajina was economically and financially dependent upon Serbia. Babić testified that Milošević held &quot;de facto&quot; control over both the Army of Serbian Krajina and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) during its actions in Krajina via an alternate chain of command through the Serbian police.

<doc id="526409" wikidata="Q33656" url="?curid=526409" title="Kildin Sami">
<text>Kildin Sámi is a Sámi language spoken on the Kola Peninsula of northwestern Russia by the Kildin Sámi, who have historically inhabited the peninsula.

The Sámi languages closest to Kildin are Ter Sámi and Akkala Sámi, in Soviet tradition sometimes considered to be dialects of Kildin Sámi. From a strictly geographical point of view, only Kildin and Ter, spoken on the Peninsula, could be regarded as Kola Sámi. It is the largest of the Eastern Sámi languages by number of speakers. However, unlike its close relatives Skolt Sámi or Inari Sámi Kildin is today only used actively by very few people.

==Geographic distribution==

Originally, Kildin Sámi was spoken in clustered areas of the mainland and coastal parts of the Kola Peninsula. Nowadays, Kildin Sámi speakers can be found in rural and urban areas, including the administrative center of the oblast. The area of Lovozero has the highest concentration of speakers. Other Kildin Sámi speakers are scattered throughout the villages and small towns of the Peninsula: Revda, Kola, Loparskaya, Teriberka, but can also be found in larger more sizable towns of Murmansk Oblast such as Olenegorsk and Apatity. Lovozero is known as the main place where the language is still spoken by 700–800 ethnic Sámi amongst a total village population of approximately 3,000. However, today the Saami are but a minority in Lovozero: the large majority of the population consists of Russians and Izhma Komi. The language has only about 100 active and perhaps 600 passive speakers. As a result of relocation, migration, and forced movement of the group, the community has really fragmented and become divided over other areas in Murmansk Region, thus leading to an inability for the revival and sustenance of their language, traditions, customs, and beliefs.

==History==

===Early period ===
The Kildin Sámi (Kola Sámi) first came into contact and had more subsequent meetings with the Russians in the 12th century, when Pomor traders from the Republic of Novgorod landed on the southern shores of the Kola Peninsula. The Russians themselves inhabited and set up shelters in the Kola and the Ter Coast as it was known then during the 13th–14th centuries. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Russians started heavily occupying and building their own communities in northern Karelia and increased exposure between the Kildin Sámi and Russians naturally blossomed as a result. In the 19th century, Kola Sámi were organized and advocated for themselves through &quot;tight-knit familial communities&quot; where they worked in pastures, lived by fishing, and survived through hunting all in a concrete set around defined territory with extended family. During this time, the community shared in spiritual customs and held similar ideologies on their language and community.

In the Russian Empire, the Kildin Sámi had no authority, rights or privileges, or liberties of autonomy and independence to control their affairs and to educate and teach their language through schools. After the 1917 Revolution which overthrew the tsarist regime of Nicholas II and led to the rise of the Bolsheviks, party systems, and emphasis towards a village-centered, peasant-centered, society, the Soviet state implemented laws or statutes that encouraged the development and protection of Sámi language and Sámi culture.

===Stalinist era ===
During the 1930s, with an orientation toward Russian nationalism (&quot;Russification&quot;) and Russian identity that came about more dramatically with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rise to power and his oppressive tactics, Kola Sámi languages and culture came under intense pressure. His oppressive agricultural, economic, and cultural policies also led to the arrest of those who resisted collectivization, including many who lived in the Kola tundras. As Russia entered World War II, Kildin Sámi youth were drafted to serve in the Red Army, which lessened hardships and prejudices they faced for a temporary period. Although the repression ended after the death of Stalin in 1953, Russification policies continued and the work with the Sámi languages started again only in the beginning of the 1980s when new teaching materials and dictionaries were published.

===Current state===
As social and cultural emphasis has been put on the writing and speaking of the various languages that constitute Russia, Kildin Sámi has now become a critically endangered language. Russian is prominently spoken in Kildin Sámi communities so much so that the original language is hardly ever heard of or only spoken privately amongst those who still know how to do so within an insular community. The few Kildin Sámi who speak and understand their language proficiently can also speak various dialectical tongues that constitute ethnic Russia. Because the language has eroded so rapidly over the centuries, it is more widely spoken amongst or between older elders who were taught and educated between themselves and thus retained the spoken language and hardly spoken by children. In Lovozero, Kildin Sámi was taught as an elective subject for first through fourth graders ; however, beginning in the 2014–15 school year, Kildin Sámi language instruction was folded into a broader class on Sámi history, culture, and folklore. The reasons for the loss and decline in speakership is as follows: a lack of education, dispersion of the Sámi, no generational transmission of traditional Sámi trades and ways of life, and not ever needing to speak or not regularly speaking the language have both caused speakership to take a hit over the years. Kildin Sámi is written using an official Cyrillic script.

==Opportunities and challenges for the Kildin Sámi==
===Opportunities ===
There is an opportunity to revitalize, reintegrate, and have Kildin Sámi be more widely spoken such as reintroducing and raising awareness and support for Kildin Sámi as an everyday language for communication—like in the Sámi community of Lovozero. Youth and adolescents are expressing more interest now to speak Kildin Sámi which can help in the languages survival. A sizable portion of political and cultural Kildin Sámi groups are pushing for policies and local measures that help to maintain and protect Sámi tradition, which is important if the language is to survive the test of time. The federal Russian legislation guarantees the Sámi several legal rights giving them language sovereignty and rights to use and develop their languages. But for the practical realization of these rights the Kola Sámi community needs to hold a constant constructive dialogue with the municipal and regional authorities, which have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Sámi in the development of the Sámi language and culture.

===Challenges ===
A majority of children remain ignorant of their traditional languages, customs and beliefs, and have had no formal or informal teaching which may give them a base of knowledge from which to work from. Antiquated materials, ineffective or inaccessible resources, and old teaching methods are often used to teach the language; there is no efforts towards the transmission of the language to future generations nor is there an active effort to preserve written language for scholarly use or to build opportunities to learn Kildin Sámi at higher levels. Although authorities and some government officials express a desire and willingness to resuscitate and revitalize the language, the community is not using that to their advantage, either because they do not know how to do so or whom to reach out to. There is no collaboration or team effort from language activists, language experts and language users and no coordinated or organized process to make learning the Kildin Sámi language a reality for more people. A language center or another initiative to carry out a more coordinated and well-planned language work could solve that problem.

==Phonology==
Below is one analysis of the consonants in Kildin Sámi as given by &quot;The Oxford Guide to the Uralic Languages&quot;:

* Geminates occur in all consonants, with the exception of preaspirated consonants as well as voiced alveolar and prepalatal fricatives and affricates.

&quot;The Oxford Guide to the Uralic Languages&quot; gives the following inventory of monophthongs:

Rimma Kuruch&#x27;s dictionary presents a slightly different set of monophthongs:

== Writing system ==
Kildin Sámi has been written in an extended version of Cyrillic since the 1980s. The alphabet has three variants with some minor differences among certain letters, mostly in Ҋ vs. Ј and ʼ (apostrophe) vs. Һ. The Sammallahti/Khvorostukhina dictionary (1991) uses Ҋ and ʼ (apostrophe); Antonova et al. (1985) uses Ј and Һ; a third orthographic variant, used by Kert (1986), has neither of these letters.

Note that the letters Ӓ, Ҋ/Ј, Һ/ʼ (apostrophe), Ӆ, Ӎ, Ӊ, Ӈ, Ҏ, Ъ, Ь, Ҍ and Ӭ do not occur in the word-initial position, either because the letters mark features of preceding consonants or the sounds they represent do not occur word initially. Therefore these letters do not normally occur in uppercase, except for all caps text.

The letter Щ occurs only in Russian loanwords.

The orthographic principles are more or less similar to Russian, but note the following special features.

===Palatalization ===
Similar to Russian, palatalization of a consonant in Kildin Sámi is marked by the letter Ь or one of the vowel letters Е, Ё, И, Ю, and Я following the consonant. Palatalized Д, Т, Н, however, are marked by ҍ or one of the vowel letters Ӓ and Ӭ. The consonant letter Н before Ь or one of the vowel letters Е, Ё, И, Ю, and Я does not represent palatalization but the palatal nasal .

===Long vowels ===
Long vowels are marked with a macron over the vowel letter (and above the diaeresis in the cases of Ё).

===Preaspiration ===
The letter Һ occurs before the letters П, Т, К, Ц and Ч, and marks (historical) preaspiration. The actual pronunciation, however, varies between true preaspiration and the fricative sounds , , or .

===Voiceless sonorants ===
Voiceless sonorants are represented by the letters Ҋ/Ј, Ӆ, Ӎ, Ӊ, and Ҏ.

===Velar nasal===
The velar nasal is written as Ӈ.

==Grammar==
=== Nouns ===

According to Kuruch, Kildin Sámi nouns are classified into several declensions.

=== Negation ===
In Kildin Sámi negation is formed by a syntagma, which consists of a finite negative auxiliary and a finite main verb in a special form called connegative (negative form of the main verb). The negative auxiliary gets inflected by person, number and mood, while the main verb is marked for tense.

This is the inflectional paradigm of the negative auxiliary:

Negative clause in present tense:
Negative clause in present tense:
With the negation of the verb &quot;to be&quot; in the third person it comes to an amalgamation of the main verb and the negative auxiliary:
* &quot;ellʹa&quot; = &quot;is not&quot;, compound of &quot;ejj&quot; (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and &quot;lea&quot; (connegative, present, main verb: &quot;to be&quot;)
* &quot;jievla&quot; = &quot;are not&quot;, compound of &quot;jiev&quot; (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and &quot;lea&quot; (connegative, present, main verb: &quot;to be&quot;)
* &quot;ellʹij&quot; = &quot;was not&quot;, compound of &quot;ejj&quot; (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and &quot;liijja&quot; (connegative, past, main verb: &quot;to be&quot;)

In the third person plural of the past tense there is no amalgamation of the negative auxiliary and the main verb &quot;to be&quot;:
* &quot;jiev liijja&quot; = &quot;were not&quot;, compound of &quot;jiev&quot; (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and &quot;liijja&quot; (connegative, past, main verb: &quot;to be&quot;)

Negative indefinite pronouns are formed with the negative prefix &quot;ni-&quot;. It is the only prefix in Kildin Sámi and is borrowed from the Russian language. The prefix &quot;ni-&quot; can get used with all interrogative pronouns. Negative indefinite pronouns are also inflected for case. Some examples are:
* &quot;ni-kʹē&quot; -who? nominative, singular &quot;nobody&quot;
* &quot;ni-kʹējn&quot; -who? comitative, singular &quot;with nobody&quot;
* &quot;ni-kʹēnn&quot; -who? genitive, singular &quot;nobody&#x27;s&quot;
* &quot;ni-mī&quot; -what? nominative, singular &quot;nothing&quot;
* &quot;ni-mēnn&quot; -what? accusative, singular &quot;nothing&quot;
== Vocabulary ==

=== Loanwords to English ===
The word &quot;tundra&quot; has been borrowed to English, via Russian. In Kildin Sámi, (&#x27;) means &quot;treeless plain&quot;, but its genitive case is (&#x27;).

== Literature ==
The printed item in Kildin were chapters 1-22 of the Gospel of Matthew published in 1897. It was translated with the help of native speaker consultants, in Cyrillic orthography by the Finnish linguist Arvid Genetz, and printed at the expense of the British and Foreign Bible Society. (The rest of the Gospel was in Akkala Sámi language.)

<text>The Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party was a political party in the Dominion of Newfoundland before it joined Canada.

The party was created by Attorney-General Edward Patrick Morris in 1907, when he split from the ruling Liberal Party to found his own political vehicle. The party tied with the Liberals in the 1908 election but, when no party was able to form a government, new elections were held which the People&#x27;s Party won with 26 seats to 10 for the Liberals.

Morris and the People&#x27;s Party were re-elected in the 1913 election, winning 16 seats compared to 7 for the Liberals and 8 for the Fishermen&#x27;s Protective Union led by William Coaker.

In 1917, a wartime crisis over conscription resulted in Morris inviting the opposition parties to join in a National Government, which ruled for two years. Morris retired at the end of 1917, and was replaced as People&#x27;s Party leader by Sir Michael Patrick Cashin.

Cashin&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1919 election by Richard Squires and his Liberal Reform Party (a merger between the Liberals and the FPU). In opposition, Cashin changed the name of the party to the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party, which contested the 1923 election but disappeared afterwards. Some members of that party joined Albert Hickman&#x27;s new Liberal-Progressive Party, while others joined with Tories to form the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party.

Although not a sectarian party, the People&#x27;s Party and its immediate successor had their support concentrated among Catholic voters, particularly on the south coast of the island.

<text>The Nvidia nForce2 chipset was released by Nvidia in July 2002 as a refresh to the original nForce product offering. The nForce2 chipset was a platform for motherboards supporting AMD&#x27;s Socket A CPUs along with DDR SDRAM. There were multiple variations of the chipset including one with an integrated GeForce4 MX graphics processor (IGP), and one without.

==Refresh==

In 2003, Nvidia released a refreshed nForce2, called &quot;nForce2 Ultra 400&quot;. The nForce2 Ultra 400 and nForce2 400 presented official support for a 200 MHz FSB and PC-3200 DDR SDRAM, whereas the older nForce2 only supported a maximum of 166 MHz FSB. Ultra 400 offered dual-channel support, while the plain 400 was single-channel PC-3200-capable. Both performed very similarly because neither had the IGP. Athlon XP did not benefit significantly from the added bandwidth because the Athlon XP&#x27;s bus was only capable of bandwidth matching a single channel of PC-3200. 

The new chipset was partnered with several different southbridges, including one with (MCP-T) and one without (MCP) SoundStorm and dual Ethernet NICs. In 2004 three new southbridges were introduced: MCP-S integrated Serial ATA, MCP-RAID had additional RAID-functions and MCP-Gb featured Gigabit Ethernet. These newer southbridges did not integrate the SoundStorm unit nor the dual-Ethernet capabilities of the MCP-T.

<doc id="526423" wikidata="Q33462" url="?curid=526423" title="Inari Sámi language">
<text>Inari Sámi ( or ) is a Sámi language spoken by the Inari Sámi of Finland. It has approximately 400 speakers, the majority of whom are middle-aged or older and live in the municipality of Inari. According to the Sámi Parliament of Finland, 269 persons used Inari Sámi as their first language. It is the only Sámi language that is spoken exclusively in Finland. The language is classified as being seriously endangered, as few children learn it; however, more and more children are learning it in language nests. In 2018, Inari Sámi had about 400 speakers; due to revival efforts, the number had increased.

==History==

The first book in Inari Sámi was &quot;Anar sämi kiela aapis kirje ja doctor Martti Lutherus Ucca katkismus&quot;, which was written and translated by Edvard Wilhelm Borg in 1859. The written history of modern Inari Sámi, however, is said to begin with Lauri Arvid Itkonen&#x27;s translation of the history of the Bible in 1906, although he had already translated some other books into Inari Sámi (Martin Luther and John Charles Ryles). After that, Inari Sámi was mainly published in books written by linguists, in particular Frans Äimä and Erkki Itkonen. For many years, very little literature was written in Inari Sámi, although Sämitigge has funded and published a lot of books, etc., in recent years.

Since 1992, Finland&#x27;s Sámi have had the right to interact with officials in their own language in areas where they have traditionally lived: Enontekiö, Utsjoki, Inari and the northern part of Sodankylä as official policy favors the conservation of the language. All announcements in Inari, which is the only officially quadrilingual municipality in Finland, must be made in Finnish, North Sámi, Inari Sámi and Skolt Sámi. Only about 10% of the public servants in the area, however, can serve the Inari Sámi-speaking population in Inari Sámi, so Finnish is used by the remaining 90%.

In 1986, the Anarâškielâ servi (Inari Sámi Language Association) was founded to promote the language and its use. The association publishes numerous books, textbooks, a calendar, etc., in Inari Sámi. They have established a language immersion program in 1997 for 3- to 6-year-old children in a day care in Inari and Ivalo. In 2007, the association started publishing an Inari Sámi newspaper called &quot;Kierâš&quot; online.

A new phenomenon is the use of Inari Sámi in rap songs by Mikkâl Morottaja, whose stage name is Amoc. Morottaja published the first full-length Inari Sámi rap CD in the world on 6 February 2007, the Sámi National Day.

==Geographic distribution==
Along with Finnish, Skolt Sámi and Northern Sámi, Inari Sámi is one of the four official languages in the municipality of Inari, in particular in the following villages located on the shore of Lake Inari (the Inari Sámi name for the village is enclosed in parentheses):

*Aksujärvi (Ákšujävri)
*Iijärvi (Ijjävri)
*Inari (Aanaar)
*Ivalo (Avveel)
*Kaamanen (Kaamâs)
*Menesjärvi (Menišjävri)
*Nellim (Njellim)
*Partakko (Päärtih)
*Repojoki (Riemâšjuuhâ)
*Sevettijärvi (Čevetjävri)
*Syysjärvi (Čovčjävri)
*Tirro (Mosshâš)

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

===Vowels===

Notes:
* The central open vowel was distinguished only in older Inari Sámi. In the modern language, it has merged into the front vowel .

===Prosody===

Inari Sámi, like the other Samic languages, has fixed word-initial stress. Words are furthermore divided into feet, usually consisting of two syllables each, and with secondary stress on the first syllable of every foot. In the other Samic languages the last syllable in a word with an odd number of syllables is not assigned to a foot. In Inari Sámi, however, two important changes in the early development of Inari Sámi have changed this structure, making the prosodic rhythm quite different:
# In words with an odd number of syllables, the last two syllables were converted into a foot, leaving the third-last syllable as a foot of its own.
# The apocope of certain final vowels, in words of three syllables or more, reduced this new final foot to a single syllable.
Consequently, Inari Sámi distinguishes prosodically between words that originally ended in a vowel but have undergone apocope, and words that already ended in a consonant in Proto-Samic.

This rearrangement of the foot structure has an effect on the length of vowels and consonants.

==Orthography==

Inari Sámi is written using the Latin script. The alphabet currently used for Inari Sámi was made official in 1996 and stands as follows:

The phonetic values are the same as in Karelian, and &quot;đ&quot; represents the voiced dental fricative (in English &quot;the&quot;). Q/q, W/w, X/x, Å/å, Ö/ö are also used in words of foreign origin. &quot;Á&quot; was traditionally pronounced in the middle of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ä&quot;, but in modern Inari Sámi the distinction between &quot;á&quot; and &quot;ä&quot; is nonexistent. In writing, &quot;Á&quot; and &quot;ä&quot; are nevertheless considered separate characters. &quot;Ä&quot; is used in: 
* the first syllable of a word, when there is an &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot; in a second syllable of the same word,
* a word of only one syllable (although &quot;á&quot; is also used), or
* the diphthong &quot;iä&quot; (but not in the diphthong &quot;uá&quot;).

===Marks used in reference works===

In dictionaries, grammars and other linguistic works, the following additional marks are used. These are not used in normal writing.
* A dot is placed below consonants to indicate a half-long consonant: &quot;đ̣, j̣, ḷ, ṃ, ṇ, ṇj, ŋ̣, ṛ, ṿ&quot;. Some works may instead print the letter in bold, or use a capital letter.
* A vertical line ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE), typewriter apostrophe or other similar mark is placed between consonants to indicate that the preceding consonant is long, and the preceding diphthong is short. It is only used when a diphthong precedes.
* The same mark placed between a diphthong and a consonant indicates that the diphthong is short.
* The same mark placed between a single vowel and a consonant indicates that the vowel is half-long.

==Grammar==

===Consonant gradation===

Consonant gradation is a pattern of alternations between pairs of consonants that appears in the inflection of words. Consonant gradation in Inari Sámi is more complex than that of other Sámi languages, because of the effects of the unique stress pattern of Inari Sámi. Like in other Sámi languages, there is a distinction between the strong and weak grade, but a second factor is whether the consonants appear in the middle of a foot (FM) or in the juncture between two feet (FJ). In the latter case, consonants are often lengthened.

===Umlaut===

Umlaut is a phenomenon in Inari Sámi, whereby the vowel in the second syllable affects the quality of the vowel in the first.

The following table lists the Inari Sámi outcomes of the Proto-Samic first-syllable vowel, for each second-syllable vowel.

As can be seen, several of the Proto-Samic vowels have identical outcomes before certain second-syllable vowels. Only before Proto-Samic &quot;*ē&quot; are all vowels distinguishable. For example, Proto-Samic &quot;*oa&quot; and &quot;*ë&quot; both appear before &quot;*ë&quot; as &quot;o&quot;, while &quot;*o&quot; and &quot;*u&quot; both appear as &quot;u&quot;. In cases where the second-syllable vowel changes, it is necessary to know which series the vowel of a particular word belongs to. For example, &quot;to drink&quot; has the third-person singular present indicative form , while &quot;to end&quot; has ; the former originates from Proto-Samic &quot;*u&quot;, the latter from &quot;*o&quot;.

A second kind of umlaut also occurs, which operates in reverse: when the first syllable contains &quot;a&quot; (originating from Proto-Samic &quot;*ë&quot;) and the second syllable contains &quot;á&quot;, the second-syllable vowel is backed to &quot;a&quot;. Thus, the third-person singular present indicative form of &quot;to go&quot; is (rather than *), and the illative singular of &quot;age&quot; is (rather than *).

===Nouns===

Inari Sámi has nine cases, although the genitive and accusative are often the same:

*Nominative
*Genitive
*Accusative
*Locative
*Illative
*Comitative
*Abessive
*Essive
*Partitive

The partitive appears to be a highly unproductive case in that it seems to only be used in the singular. In addition, unlike Finnish, Inari Sámi does not make use of the partitive case for objects of transitive verbs. Thus &quot; could translate into Finnish as either &quot; (English: &quot;I&#x27;m eating (all of) the bread&quot;) or &quot;&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m eating (some) bread&quot;, or generally, &quot;I eat bread&quot;); this telicity contrast is mandatory in Finnish.

===Pronouns===

The personal pronouns have three numbers: singular, plural and dual. The following table contains personal pronouns in the nominative and genitive/accusative cases.

The next table demonstrates the declension of a personal pronoun &quot;I/we (dual)/we (plural)&quot; in the various cases:
