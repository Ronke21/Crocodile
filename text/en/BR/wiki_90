<text>Brunswick Square is a public garden and ancillary streets along two of its sides in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden. It is overlooked by the School of Pharmacy and the Foundling Museum to the north; the Brunswick Centre to the west; and International Hall (a hall of residence of the University of London) to the south. East is an enclosed area of playgrounds with further trees, Coram&#x27;s Fields, associated with charity Coram Family which is just over double its size; next to that area Brunswick Square is mirrored, symmetrically by Mecklenburgh Square, likewise of 3 acres including roads. The squares are named after contemporary Queen consorts (the wife of George III and the wife of his eldest son George IV).

==Layout==

Bloomsbury is notable for its garden squares, literary connections, and numerous cultural, educational and health care institutions. Mecklenburgh Square is a matching square to the east covering three acres. Between the two, east of this square, is an enclosed area of playgrounds with further trees, Coram&#x27;s Fields (associated with charity Coram Family) which occupies just over seven acres. Russell Square is the nearest tube station to the south-west.

;Protection
Brunswick Square and Mecklenburgh Square and Coram&#x27;s Fields are jointly listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==
What is now the square (apart from the longer of the two roads bounding it and sharing in its name which is older) including the nearer part of buildings facing it was originally part of the grounds of the Foundling Hospital. It was planned to be leased for housebuilding, along with Mecklenburgh Square, to raise funds for the hospital in 1790. Brunswick Square, named after Caroline of Brunswick, was finished first, being built by James Burton in 1795–1802; none of the original houses remain.

The bronze sculpture of a child&#x27;s mitten, by Tracey Emin, sits on top of one of the railings outside the Foundling Museum.

==In literature, arts and the media==
In Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot;, John and Isabella Knightley live in Brunswick Square.

In William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Mr. Osborne lives in Brunswick Square.

==Notable residents==
John Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square in 1819.

The Minerva Club was founded here by Dr Elizabeth Knight and Alice Green in 1920. The club was used for Women&#x27;s Freedom League meetings and as a hostel for suffrage activists and fund-raising annual birthday parties for Charlotte Despard. Despard travelled from Ireland each year to attend.

The writer E.M. Forster used 26 Brunswick Square as his London base from 1930 to 1939.

<text>Protagoras ( ; ) is a dialogue by Plato. The traditional subtitle (which may or may not be Plato&#x27;s) is &quot;or the Sophists&quot;. The main argument is between Socrates and the elderly Protagoras, a celebrated sophist and philosopher. The discussion takes place at the home of Callias, who is host to Protagoras while he is in town. The philosophical issues raised in the &quot;Protagoras&quot; include the unity and the teachability of virtue, and the relationship between pleasure and goodness.

==The characters==

Of the twenty-one people who are specifically said to be present, three are known sophists. In addition to Protagoras himself, there are Hippias of Elis and Prodicus of Ceos. Two of the sons of Pericles are said to be there, Paralus and Xanthippus. With the exception of Aristophanes, all of Socrates&#x27; named friends from the &quot;&quot;Symposium&quot;&quot; are in attendance: Eryximachus the doctor, Phaedrus, the lovers Pausanias and Agathon (who is said to be a mere boy at this point), and Alcibiades. Additionally, there are several unnamed foreigners whom Protagoras is said to have picked up in his travels and a servant (a eunuch) in the employ of Callias.

==The dialogue==

=== Introduction ===
The dialogue begins with an unnamed friend of Socrates asking him how his pursuit of the young Alcibiades, just now reputed to be growing his first beard, is proceeding. Socrates explains that while he has just been in the company of Alcibiades, his mind is now on more interesting matters. He says that the Sophist Protagoras, the wisest man alive (309c–d), is in town. Socrates relates the story of how his young friend, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus, came knocking on his door before daybreak and roused him out of bed. Hippocrates was in a big hurry to be present when Protagoras held court, as he was expected to do, at the home of Callias, and wanted Socrates to introduce him as a potential student to the old Sophist, as Protagoras had a great reputation as a teacher.

=== Socrates examines Hippocrates ===
Socrates warns the excitable Hippocrates that Sophists are dangerous. He tells him that the words of the Sophists go straight into the soul (&quot;psychē&quot;) and can corrupt a person straightaway. Socrates says that buying wisdom from a Sophist is different from buying food and drink at the market. With food and drink, you never know what you are getting, but you can consult experts for advice before consuming anything that might be dangerous (313a–314c).

Socrates says he regards Prodicus as a man of inspired genius (316a). He expresses the same admiration for Prodicus in another dialogue, the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;. Socrates later notes that Prodicus was assigned to sleep in a storage room that his host had cleaned out for the visit (315d).

=== At the house of Callias ===
Socrates accompanies Hippocrates to the home of Callias, and they stand in the doorway chatting about &quot;some point which had come up along the road&quot; (314c). A eunuch opens the door, takes one look at them, guesses they are Sophists, and slams the door in their faces (314d). They knock again, and this time assure the porter they are not Sophists, but only want to visit Protagoras. The porter lets them in, and it is at this point that Socrates recites the list of guests. Upon entering, Socrates and young Hippocrates witness the great Sophist Protagoras walking around the cloister, surrounded by numerous men, some of them famous Athenians which Socrates mentioned by name, like Charmides and the two sons of Pericles. Plato describes how the crowd opens and reassembles behind Protagoras every time the Sophist makes a turn while walking.

=== Protagoras the sophist ===
Protagoras does not deny being a Sophist, and claims that it is an ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used the arts as a screen, a front, to protect themselves from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus would not want to miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him from his bed (317c–e).

=== Protagoras&#x27; opening speech ===
Socrates asks Protagoras &quot;in respect to what&quot; Hippocrates will improve by associating with him, as, for example, he would improve in medicine by associating himself with a doctor (318d). Protagoras begins by saying that a good Sophist can make his students into good citizens by teaching civic virtue (πολιτικὴν τέχνην). Socrates says that this is fine and good, but that he personally believes that this is not feasible since virtue cannot be taught (319b). He adds that technical skill (technē) can be imparted to students by teachers, but that wisdom cannot be. By way of example, Socrates points to the fact that while in matters concerning specialised labour one would take advice only from the appropriate specialist, like for example builders (τέκτονες) about construction, in matters of state everyone&#x27;s opinions are considered, which proves that political virtue is within everyone, or that at least that is what Athenians in their democratic ideals believe. Another example is that Pericles did not manage to impart his wisdom to his sons (319e). Socrates then adds that Clinias, younger brother of Alcibiades, was taken from his family for fear that Alcibiades would corrupt him, and he was given back as a hopeless case. Socrates says he could give more examples, but thinks his point is sufficiently established.

=== Protagoras&#x27; mythos ===
Protagoras says his claim that virtue can be taught is better illustrated by a myth than by reasoned arguments, and he recounts a myth about the origins of living things. After the gods had created the animals including man, they assigned two Titan brothers, Epimetheus (&quot;afterthought&quot;) and Prometheus (&quot;forethought&quot;), with the task of giving each their proper traits for survival. The two agreed that Epimetheus would do the dealing, while Prometheus would check on his brother&#x27;s work. And so, Epimetheus began by giving strength to some, speed to some, and wings, claws, hooves, pelts and hides to others. But being a little foolish, or rather a &quot;late-thinker&quot; as his name implies, Epimetheus forgot to save something for man. When Prometheus saw what had happened, he realised that without pelts or claws, mankind was doomed, and so he decided to go secretly into the gods&#x27; mountain home of Olympus and steal something to give back to man. Initially, Prometheus wanted to steal temperance (sophrosyne), but this virtue was guarded inside the palace of Zeus by terrible guardians, and so, the Titan opted for the gift of fire straight from the workshop of Hephaestus and practical wisdom from the goddess Athena. Because Prometheus failed to enter the palace of Zeus, however, man was never granted civic wisdom, and so his race was still in danger of extinction. Seeing this, Zeus sent Hermes to distribute shame and justice among human beings, and to do so equally. To Protagoras, this answers Socrates&#x27; question as to why people think that wisdom about architecture or medicine is limited to the few while wisdom about justice and politics is more broadly understood (322d).

=== Protagoras&#x27; logos ===
Protagoras states that he has two good pieces of evidence that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing something that can be taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness to them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates&#x27; question of why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment in which the survival of a hypothetical city-state rests on the skill of flute playing. Naturally, all parents would be eager to teach their sons how to play the flute, but given the importance of this skill, everyone would also be teaching everyone else, as it would be considered a crime to withhold this knowledge. The result would be a city where everyone would be at least decent in the art, but being taught constantly and by everyone, those naturally gifted would always be better than those who happen to have gifted parents. The same goes for virtue. It is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree by everyone else, and to the point that it seems like a part of human nature, while children of virtuous men do not always exceed the rest (327b–d).

=== Socrates&#x27; complaint ===
Socrates admits that Protagoras has given an excellent answer and that there is only one small thing to clarify, which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom, are one thing, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together, or many things, like features of a face that form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second, but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into rhetoric that does not answer the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. It is a typical occurrence Socratic Dialogues, in which a Sophist uses eloquent speeches to hide the inconsistency of his arguments. Socrates&#x27; move is to pretend that he has a weak memory (334c), and that for the debate to continue, Protagoras needs to answer in a concise manner. This forces the Sophist to use Socrates&#x27; notorious method, his unique question/answer format that can lead to a logical conclusion, usually in Socrates&#x27; favour. Protagoras begins to bristle at this and replies that his answers are as long as they need to be, while Socrates reminds him that as a teacher of rhetoric, and one that advertises his ability to teach others all the different ways a debate can be had, he above all should be able to shorten his answers when the need arises. Their argument over form appears to be leading them nowhere, and Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk is one thing while public speaking is another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.

Socrates praises the Spartans as the best people in the world, not only because of their fierceness in battle but also because of their wisdom and philosophical skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked these qualities and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training, but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the right moment, they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).

Then the debaters return to their previous analysis of Pittacus&#x27; and Simonides&#x27; poetry. On Socrates&#x27; interpretation, Pittacus claims that it is difficult to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a–45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates&#x27; interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, with only the latter garnering his praise (345d–46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.

=== Socrates&#x27; major argument ===
Socrates then repeats the initial question of whether virtue is one or many things, and he reminds Protagoras that his answer was the latter, that virtues are many (349b-d). Protagoras accepts that this was indeed his original position, and that while the virtues are certainly connected, courage more than any other can be shown to be independent, as there are many who are both unwise &quot;and&quot; courageous. Socrates proceeds using his method, and asks whether the most courageous soldiers are those who are ignorant or knowledgeable of fighting. Protagoras says that while there are those who are courageous while being ignorant, their courage is more like madness, and that to be considered truly courageous, one needs to know what he is engaged in. But after agreeing that courageous people are necessarily knowledgeable, and therefore wise, Protagoras sees through Socrates&#x27; tricks, as the latter was indeed trying to push for a unification theory of virtue on the premise that everything, courage and justice included, are essentially wisdom, and therefore the same thing. Protagoras tells Socrates that while he agreed that the courageous are knowledgeable, he did not agree about the inverse, that wise men are also courageous. The link between courage and knowledge in other words is not commutative (350c-351b). Socrates needs to start another thread.

Socrates finally asks why it is that men do harm to themselves, by overeating or overindulging in other pleasures, and asks Protagoras whether his view is the standard one, that these men do so because of pleasure. Protagoras agrees, and Socrates continues by saying that what we call bad is not necessarily unpleasant in the short term, but necessarily so in the long term, like certain foods that cause pleasurable sensations but harm the body in the long run.

Socrates then concludes that the only reason why people exchange good for bad, like the pleasant taste of food for the sickness that comes by eating it, is because they do not know that the first (the pleasure) is short, while the second (the pain) is long. The error they make is just like one in judging the sizes of different objects when they are far away, assuming one is smaller because it&#x27;s further away. So if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). To be &quot;overcome by pleasure&quot; then means just this, ignorance. So, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. And that&#x27;s how the issue of courage can finally be addressed, after Socrates was cut short by Protagoras only a short time before. Given that courage is good, as both agree, then the lack of it, must necessarily be a lack of knowledge, and so Protagoras was wrong in saying that some courageous men are also ignorant.

=== Conclusion: The mutual exchange of the debator&#x27;s positions ===
While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it &quot;can&quot; in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchange positions, with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one (361a). Protagoras acknowledges that Socrates is a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.

<text>Summer Lightning is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 1 July 1929 by Doubleday, Doran, New York, under the title Fish Preferred, and in the United Kingdom on 19 July 1929 by Herbert Jenkins, London. It was serialised in &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot; (UK) between March and August 1929 and in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (US) from 6 April to 22 June 1929.

It forms part of the Blandings Castle saga, being the third full-length novel to be set there, after &quot;Something Fresh&quot; (1915) and &quot;Leave It to Psmith&quot; (1923). &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1933) forms a semi-sequel to the story, with many of the same characters involved.

==Plot introduction==

Gally is down at Blandings and writing his memoirs, to the horror of all who knew him in their wild youths, particularly Lord Emsworth&#x27;s neighbour and pig-fancying rival Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe. While sinister forces, including the efficient Baxter and the unpleasant Percy Pilbeam, scheme to put a stop to the book, Ronnie Fish and his old pal Hugo Carmody are entangled in difficult relationships, which require much subterfuge, some pig-theft and a little imposter-ing to resolve.

==Plot summary==

Hugo Carmody, who became secretary to Lord Emsworth following the failure of &quot;The Hot Spot&quot;, the night club he ran with Ronnie Fish, is conducting a secret affair with Millicent Threepwood, Emsworth&#x27;s niece. They hide this from Lady Constance, who is distracted with worries that the book of memoirs her brother Galahad is writing will bring shame to the family.

Ronnie, meanwhile, is secretly engaged to Sue Brown, a chorus girl and an old friend of Hugo. When they run into Lady Constance in London one day, Ronnie introduces Sue as Myra Schoonmaker, an American heiress he and his mother Lady Julia recently met in Biarritz.

Ronnie travels to Blandings, where Baxter has just returned, called in by Lady Constance to steal the memoirs. Hoping to get money out of Lord Emsworth, his trustee, Ronnie claims to love pigs, but his uncle has seen him bouncing a tennis ball on the Empress&#x27; back, and is enraged. Ronnie, inspired, steals the pig, planning to return it and earn his uncle&#x27;s gratitude, roping in Beach to help; they hide her in a cottage in the woods.

Hugo is sent to London to fetch a detective; the job is refused by Percy Pilbeam. Hugo takes Sue out dancing, but when Ronnie arrives at the club he sees Pilbeam, who admires Sue, sat at her table. Ronnie gets angry at Pilbeam, makes a scene, spends a night in jail, and in the morning snubs Sue, who he believes has betrayed him. Millicent, feeling the same about Hugo, breaks off their engagement also. Meanwhile, Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, worrying about the memoirs, hires Pilbeam to retrieve them; Pilbeam agrees, realising he can use the pig-finding job to get into the castle.

Sue heads to Blandings, posing as Myra Schoonmaker. Just after her arrival, Mortimer Mason, Sue&#x27;s employer, visits Galahad in the library to discuss the memoirs. He recognizes Sue in the garden and talks about her, so Galahad learns her true identity, sharing the knowledge only with Sue. Percy Pilbeam arrives, recognises Sue, and tries to get her help in his memoir-stealing scheme. Baxter, meanwhile, has grown suspicious that the pig was stolen by Carmody as a means of insuring his job; he spots Beach heading off to feed the pig, and follows him, just as the storm breaks.

Beach reaches the cottage to find Hugo and Millicent, gone there to shelter from the rain. Their relationship is healed, Hugo having explained about Sue and Ronnie, and Beach, protecting Ronnie, claims he stole the pig for Hugo to return and win Lord Emsworth&#x27;s favour. Beach leaves, as Carmody takes the pig to a new hiding spot.

Baxter accuses Beach in front of Emsworth, and the three of them head to the cottage, Emsworth growing ever warier of Baxter&#x27;s sanity. They find no pig, Carmody having moved it to Baxter&#x27;s caravan, where Pilbeam, also caught in the rain, saw him stow it. While Emsworth, Lady Constance, Gally and Millicent go to dinner with Parsloe-Parsloe (lured away to leave the memoirs unguarded), Ronnie Fish confronts Pilbeam, and learns that Sue was indeed out in London with Carmody, and that she has come to Blandings to be near Ronnie.

Pilbeam gets tipsy, and tells Beach about Sue, and then tells Carmody that he saw him hide the pig. Carmody, in a panic, calls Millicent at Matchingham Hall; she advises him to tell Emsworth where the pig is at once. He does so, Emsworth is overjoyed, and agrees to their marriage, much to Lady Constance&#x27;s disgust.

Meanwhile, Baxter intercepts a telegram meant for Lady Constance from Myra Schoonmaker in Paris, and goes to the imposter Sue&#x27;s room to retrieve a note he sent her, criticising Lord Emsworth. Trapped by Beach bringing her dinner, he hides under the bed while she and Ronnie are reunited. Ronnie spots Pilbeam climbing into the room to steal Galahad&#x27;s memoirs, and chases him downstairs; the returning dinner party assume they are fleeing Baxter, now confirmed as mad by the presence of the stolen pig in his caravan, and Emsworth charges into Sue&#x27;s room with a shotgun. Baxter crawls out from under the bed, flustered and enraged by his experience and Emsworth&#x27;s harsh words, reveals Sue&#x27;s deception and storms off.

Galahad, learning that Sue Brown is Dolly Henderson&#x27;s daughter, reveals that he loved her mother but was forbidden to marry her, and views Sue as a kind of honorary daughter. He tells Lady Constance that he will suppress his book if she agrees to sanction Sue and Ronnie&#x27;s marriage, and to persuade her sister Julia to do likewise. Pilbeam, hearing this as he once again climbs the drainpipe, gives up his mission, leaving Galahad to tell Sue the old story of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe and the prawns.

==Publication history==

The story was serialised under the title &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; in twelve parts in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, with illustrations by John H. Crosman. In &quot;Pall Mall Magazine&quot;, &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; was published in six parts and illustrated by Gilbert Wilkinson. The story was printed with the same title, &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;, in the &quot;Sydney Evening News&quot; in 1929.

The UK edition has a preface by Wodehouse. The UK edition also has a dedication: &quot;To Denis Mackail, author of &#x27;Greenery Street&#x27;, &#x27;The Flower Show&#x27; and other books which I wish I had written&quot;. Denis Mackail was an English writer.

The story was included in the 1979 collection &quot;Life at Blandings&quot;, published by Penguin Books. The collection also includes &quot;Something Fresh&quot; and &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;.

==Adaptations==

The novel has twice been adapted as a film, with the 1933 version &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; directed by Maclean Rogers. A 1938 Swedish adaptation, under the title &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;, was directed by Anders Henrikson and starred Olof Winnerstrand and his wife Frida Winnerstrand.

In 1987, the book was adapted as a radio drama in the &quot;Blandings&quot; radio series.

A stage play, adapted by Giles Havergal, was first performed at Glasgow&#x27;s Citizens Theatre in 1992; a 1998 revival starred Helen Baxendale as Sue Brown. The play was performed at Keswick&#x27;s &quot;Theatre by the Lake&quot; in 2009.

The novel was dramatised by Archie Scottney for BBC Radio 4 in 2010, with Charles Dance as Galahad Threepwood, Patricia Hodge as Lady Constance, Martin Jarvis as Lord Emsworth, and Ian Ogilvy as the narrator.

== Continuity with other novels==
Percy Pilbeam first appeared in &quot;Bill the Conqueror&quot; (1924). Hugo Carmody and Ronnie Fish had previously been introduced to readers in &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (1928), while the Empress appeared in the shorts &quot;Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey&quot; and &quot;Company for Gertrude&quot;, the latter also featuring the devious Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe.

Most of the cast would remain at Blandings for the excitements of &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1933).

<text>Gravity Probe B (GP-B) was a satellite-based experiment whose objective was to test two previously-unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth-orbiting satellite at of altitude, crossing directly over the poles.

The satellite was launched on 20 April 2004 on a Delta II rocket. The spaceflight phase lasted until &lt;time&gt;2005&lt;/time&gt;; Its aim was to measure spacetime curvature near Earth, and thereby the stress–energy tensor (which is related to the distribution and the motion of matter in space) in and near Earth. This provided a test of general relativity, gravitomagnetism and related models. The principal investigator was Francis Everitt.

Initial results confirmed the expected geodetic effect to an accuracy of about 1%. The expected frame-dragging effect was similar in magnitude to the current noise level (the noise being dominated by initially unmodeled effects due to nonuniform coatings on the gyroscopes). Work continued to model and account for these sources of error, thus permitting extraction of the frame-dragging signal. By &lt;time datetime=&quot;2008-08&quot;&gt;August 2008&lt;/time&gt;, the frame-dragging effect had been confirmed to within 15% of the expected result, and the &lt;time datetime=&quot;2008-12&quot;&gt;December 2008&lt;/time&gt; NASA report indicated that the geodetic effect was confirmed to be better than 0.5%.

In an article published in the journal &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; in &lt;time&gt;2011&lt;/time&gt;, the authors reported analysis of the data from all four gyroscopes results in a geodetic drift rate of and a frame-dragging drift rate of , in good agreement with the general relativity predictions of and , respectively.

==Overview==

Gravity Probe B was a relativity gyroscope experiment funded by NASA. Efforts were led by the Stanford University physics department with Lockheed Martin as the primary subcontractor. Mission scientists viewed it as the second relativity experiment in space, following the successful launch of Gravity Probe A (GP-A) in &lt;time&gt;1976&lt;/time&gt;.

The mission plans were to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at altitude, crossing directly over the poles. The gyroscopes were intended to be so free from disturbance that they would provide a near-perfect spacetime reference system. This would allow them to reveal how space and time are &quot;warped&quot; by the presence of the Earth, and by how much the Earth&#x27;s rotation &quot;drags&quot; space-time around with it.

The geodetic effect is an effect caused by space-time being &quot;curved&quot; by the mass of the Earth. A gyroscope&#x27;s axis when parallel transported around the Earth in one complete revolution does not end up pointing in exactly the same direction as before. The angle &quot;missing&quot; may be thought of as the amount the gyroscope &quot;leans over&quot; into the slope of the space-time curvature. A more precise explanation for the space curvature part of the geodetic precession is obtained by using a nearly flat cone to model the space curvature of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field. Such a cone is made by cutting out a thin &quot;pie-slice&quot; from a circle and gluing the cut edges together. The spatial geodetic precession is a measure of the missing &quot;pie-slice&quot; angle. Gravity Probe B was expected to measure this effect to an accuracy of one part in , the most stringent check on general relativistic predictions to date.

The much smaller frame-dragging effect is an example of gravitomagnetism. It is an analog of magnetism in classical electrodynamics, but caused by rotating masses rather than rotating electric charges. Previously, only two analyses of the laser-ranging data obtained by the two LAGEOS satellites, published in &lt;time&gt;1997&lt;/time&gt; and &lt;time&gt;2004&lt;/time&gt;, claimed to have found the frame-dragging effect with an accuracy of about 20% and 10% respectively, whereas Gravity Probe B aimed to measure the frame dragging effect to a precision of 1%. A recent analysis of Mars Global Surveyor data has claimed to have confirmed the frame dragging effect to a precision of 0.5%, although the accuracy of this claim is disputed.

The launch was planned for &lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-19&quot;&gt;19 April 2004&lt;/time&gt; at Vandenberg Air Force Base but was scrubbed within 5 minutes of the scheduled launch window due to changing winds in the upper atmosphere. An unusual feature of the mission is that it only had a one-second launch window due to the precise orbit required by the experiment. On &lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-20 09:57:23-07:00&quot;&gt;20 April, at 9:57:23 AM&lt;/time&gt; PDT (&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-20 16:57:23Z&quot;&gt;16:57:23&lt;/time&gt; UTC) the spacecraft was launched successfully. The satellite was placed in orbit at &lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-20 11:12:33-07:00&quot;&gt;11:12:33&lt;/time&gt; AM (&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-20 18:12:33Z&quot;&gt;18:12:33&lt;/time&gt; UTC) after a cruise period over the south pole and a short second burn. The mission lasted 16 months.
Some preliminary results were presented at a special session during the American Physical Society meeting in &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-04&quot;&gt;April 2007&lt;/time&gt;. NASA initially requested a proposal for extending the GP-B data analysis phase through &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-12&quot;&gt;December 2007&lt;/time&gt;. The data analysis phase was further extended to &lt;time datetime=&quot;2008-09&quot;&gt;September 2008&lt;/time&gt; using funding from Richard Fairbank, Stanford and NASA, and beyond that point using non-NASA funding only. Final science results were reported in &lt;time&gt;2011&lt;/time&gt;.

== Experimental setup ==

The &quot;Gravity Probe B&quot; experiment comprised four London moment gyroscopes and a reference telescope sighted on IM Pegasi, a binary star in the constellation Pegasus. In polar orbit, with the gyro spin directions also pointing toward IM Pegasi, the frame-dragging and geodetic effects came out at right angles, each gyroscope measuring both.

The gyroscopes were housed in a dewar of superfluid helium, maintaining a temperature of under . Near-absolute zero temperatures were required to minimize molecular interference, and enable the lead and niobium components of the gyroscope mechanisms to become superconductive.

At the time of their manufacture, the gyroscopes were the most nearly spherical objects ever made (two gyroscopes still hold that record, but third place has been taken by the silicon spheres made by the Avogadro project). Approximately the size of ping pong balls, they were perfectly round to within forty atoms (less than ). If one of these spheres were scaled to the size of the Earth, the tallest mountains and deepest ocean trench would measure only high. The spheres were made of fused quartz and coated with an extremely thin layer of niobium. A primary concern was minimizing any influence on their spin, so the gyroscopes could never touch their containing compartment. They were held suspended with electric fields, spun up using a flow of helium gas, and their spin axes were sensed by monitoring the magnetic field of the superconductive niobium layer with SQUIDs. (A spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field precisely aligned with the rotation axis; see London moment.)

IM Pegasi was chosen as the guide star for multiple reasons. First, it needed to be bright enough to be usable for sightings. Then it was close to the ideal positions near the celestial equator. Also important was its well-understood motion in the sky, which was helped by the fact that this star emits relatively strong radio signals. In preparation for the setup of this mission, astronomers analyzed the radio-based position measurements with respect to far distant quasars taken over several years to understand its motion as precisely as needed.

== History ==
The conceptual design for this mission was first proposed by an MIT professor, George Pugh, who was working with the U.S. Department of Defense in &lt;time&gt;1959&lt;/time&gt; and later discussed by Leonard Schiff (Stanford) in &lt;time&gt;1960&lt;/time&gt; at Pugh&#x27;s suggestion, based partly on a theoretical paper about detecting frame dragging that Schiff had written in &lt;time&gt;1957&lt;/time&gt;. It was proposed to NASA in &lt;time&gt;1961&lt;/time&gt;, and they supported the project with funds in &lt;time&gt;1964&lt;/time&gt;. This grant ended in &lt;time&gt;1977&lt;/time&gt; after a long phase of engineering research into the basic requirements and tools for the satellite.

In &lt;time&gt;1986&lt;/time&gt; NASA changed plans for the Space Shuttle, which forced the mission team to switch from a shuttle-based launch design to one that was based on the Delta 2, and in &lt;time&gt;1995&lt;/time&gt; tests planned of a prototype on a shuttle flight were cancelled as well.

Gravity Probe B marks the first time that Stanford University has been in control of the development and operations of a space satellite funded by NASA.

The total cost of the project was about $750 million.

== Mission timeline ==


This is a list of major events for the GP-B experiment.

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-20&quot;&gt;20 April 2004&lt;/time&gt; : Launch of GP-B from Vandenberg AFB and successful insertion into polar orbit.

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-08-27&quot;&gt;27 August 2004&lt;/time&gt; : GP-B entered its science phase. On mission day 129 all systems were configured to be ready for data collection, with the only exception being gyro 4, which needed further spin axis alignment.

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-08-15&quot;&gt;15 August 2005&lt;/time&gt; : The science phase of the mission ended and the spacecraft instruments transitioned to the final calibration mode.

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-09-26&quot;&gt;26 September 2005&lt;/time&gt; : The calibration phase ended with liquid helium still in the dewar. The spacecraft was returned to science mode pending the depletion of liquid helium.

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-02&quot;&gt;February 2006&lt;/time&gt; : Phase I of data analysis complete

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-09&quot;&gt;September 2006&lt;/time&gt; : Analysis team realised that more error analysis was necessary (particularly around the polhode motion of the gyros) than could be done in the time to &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-04&quot;&gt;April 2007&lt;/time&gt; and applied to NASA for an extension of funding to the end of &lt;time&gt;2007&lt;/time&gt;.

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-12&quot;&gt;December 2006&lt;/time&gt; : Completion of Phase III of data analysis

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-04-14&quot;&gt;14 April 2007&lt;/time&gt; : Announcement of best results obtained to date. Francis Everitt gave a plenary talk at the meeting of the American Physical Society announcing initial results: &quot;The data from the GP-B gyroscopes clearly confirm Einstein&#x27;s predicted geodetic effect to a precision of better than 1 percent. However, the frame-dragging effect is 170 times smaller than the geodetic effect, and Stanford scientists are still extracting its signature from the spacecraft data.&quot; 

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2010-12-08&quot;&gt;8 December 2010&lt;/time&gt; : GP-B spacecraft decommissioned, left in its polar orbit. 

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2011-05-04&quot;&gt;4 May 2011&lt;/time&gt; : GP-B Final experimental results were announced. In a public press and media event at NASA Headquarters, GP-B Principal Investigator, Francis Everitt presented the final results of Gravity Probe B. 

; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2015-11-14&quot;&gt;19 November 2015&lt;/time&gt; : Publication of GP-B Special Volume (Volume 32, Issue 22) in the peer-reviewed journal, &quot;Classical and Quantum Gravity&quot;. 

On &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-02-09&quot;&gt;9 February 2007&lt;/time&gt;, it was announced that a number of unexpected signals had been received and that these would need to be separated out before final results could be released. In &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-04&quot;&gt;April&lt;/time&gt; it was announced that the spin axes of the gyroscopes were affected by torque, in a manner that varied over time, requiring further analysis to allow the results to be corrected for this source of error. Consequently, the date for the final release of data was pushed back several times. In the data for the frame-dragging results presented at the &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-04&quot;&gt;April 2007&lt;/time&gt; meeting of the American Physical Society, the random errors were much larger than the theoretical expected value and scattered on both the positive and negative sides of a null result, therefore causing skepticism as to whether any useful data could be extracted in the future to test this effect.

In &lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-06&quot;&gt;June 2007&lt;/time&gt;, a detailed update was released explaining the cause of the problem, and the solution that was being worked on. Although electrostatic patches caused by non-uniform coating of the spheres were anticipated, and were thought to have been controlled for before the experiment, it was subsequently found that the final layer of the coating on the spheres defined two-halves of slightly different contact potential, which gave the sphere an electrostatic axis. This created a classical dipole torque on each rotor, of a magnitude similar to the expected frame dragging effect. In addition, it dissipated energy from the polhode motion by inducing currents in the housing electrodes, causing the motion to change with time. This meant that a simple time-average polhode model was insufficient, and a detailed orbit by orbit model was needed to remove the effect. As it was anticipated that &quot;anything could go wrong&quot;, the final part of the flight mission was calibration, where amongst other activities, data was gathered with the spacecraft axis deliberately misaligned for &lt;time datetime=&quot;PT24h&quot;&gt;24 hours&lt;/time&gt;, to exacerbate any potential problems. This data proved invaluable for identifying the effects. With the electrostatic torque modeled as a function of axis misalignment, and the polhode motion modeled at a sufficiently fine level, it was hoped to isolate the relativity torques to the originally expected resolution.

Stanford agreed to release the raw data to the public at an unspecified date in the future. It is likely that this data will be examined by independent scientists and independently reported to the public well after the final release by the project scientists. Because future interpretations of the data by scientists outside GP-B may differ from the official results, it may take several more years for all of the data received by GP-B to be completely understood.

=== NASA review ===
A review by a panel of 15 experts commissioned by NASA recommended against extending the data analysis phase beyond &lt;time&gt;2008&lt;/time&gt;. They warned that the required reduction in noise level (due to classical torques and breaks in data collection due to solar flares) &quot;is so large that any effect ultimately detected by this experiment will have to overcome considerable (and in our opinion, well justified) skepticism in the scientific community&quot;.

=== Data analysis after NASA ===
NASA funding and sponsorship of the program ended on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2008-09-30&quot;&gt;30 September 2008&lt;/time&gt;, but GP-B secured alternative funding from King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia that enabled the science team to continue working at least through &lt;time datetime=&quot;2009-12&quot;&gt;December 2009&lt;/time&gt;. On &lt;time datetime=&quot;2008-08-29&quot;&gt;29 August 2008&lt;/time&gt;, the 18th meeting of the external GP-B Science Advisory Committee was held at Stanford to report progress. 

The Stanford-based analysis group and NASA announced on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2011-05-04&quot;&gt;4 May 2011&lt;/time&gt; that the data from GP-B indeed confirms the two predictions of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. The findings were published in the journal &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;. The prospects for further experimental measurement of frame-dragging after GP-B were commented on in the journal &quot;Europhysics Letters&quot;.

<doc id="531115" wikidata="Q938558" url="?curid=531115" title="Harry Bateman">
<text>Harry Bateman FRS (29 May 1882 – 21 January 1946) was an English mathematician with a specialty in differential equations of mathematical physics. With Ebenezer Cunningham, he expanded the views of spacetime symmetry of Lorentz and Poincare to a more expansive conformal group of spacetime leaving Maxwell&#x27;s equations invariant. Moving to the US, he obtained a Ph.D. in geometry with Frank Morley and became a professor of mathematics at California Institute of Technology. There he taught fluid dynamics to students going into aerodynamics with Theodore von Karman. Bateman made a broad survey of applied differential equations in his Gibbs Lecture in 1943 titled, &quot;The control of an elastic fluid&quot;.

==Biography==
Bateman was born in Manchester, England, on 29 May 1882. He first gained an interest in mathematics during his time at Manchester Grammar School. In his final year, he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. Bateman studied with coach Robert Alfred Herman to prepare for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. He distinguished himself in 1903 as Senior Wrangler (tied with P.E. Marrack) and by winning the Smith&#x27;s Prize (1905).

His first paper, &quot;The determination of curves satisfying given conditions&quot;, was published when he was still an undergraduate student. He studied in Göttingen and Paris, and taught at the University of Liverpool and University of Manchester. After moving to the US in 1910, he taught at Bryn Mawr College and then Johns Hopkins University. There, working with Frank Morley in geometry, he achieved his Ph.D., prior to which he had already published more than 60 papers, including some of his celebrated papers. In 1917, he took up his permanent position at the California Institute of Technology, which was then known as the &quot;Throop Polytechnic Institute&quot;.

Eric Temple Bell says, &quot;Like his contemporaries and immediate predecessors among Cambridge mathematicians of the first decade of this century [1901–1910]... Bateman was thoroughly trained in both pure analysis and mathematical physics, and retained an equal interest in both throughout his scientific career.&quot;

Theodore von Kármán was called in as an advisor for a projected aeronautics laboratory at Caltech and later gave this appraisal of Bateman:
Harry Bateman married Ethel Horner in 1912 and had a son named Harry Graham, who died as a child. Later, the couple adopted a daughter named Joan Margaret. He died on his way to New York in 1946 of coronary thrombosis.

==Scientific contributions==
In 1907, Harry Bateman was lecturing at the University of Liverpool together with another senior wrangler, Ebenezer Cunningham. In 1908, together they came up with the idea of a conformal group of spacetime (now usually denoted as ) which involved an extension of the method of images.
In nuclear physics, the Bateman equation is a mathematical model describing abundances and activities in a decay chain as a function of time, based on the decay rates and initial abundances. The model was formulated by Ernest Rutherford in 1905 and the analytical solution was provided by Harry Bateman in 1910.

For his part, in 1910 Bateman published &quot;The Transformation of the Electrodynamical Equations&quot;. He showed that the Jacobian matrix of a spacetime diffeomorphism which preserves the Maxwell equations is proportional to an orthogonal matrix, hence conformal. The transformation group of such transformations has 15 parameters and extends both the Poincaré group and the Lorentz group. Bateman called the elements of this group spherical wave transformations.

In evaluating this paper, one of his students, Clifford Truesdell, wrote:

Bateman was the first to apply Laplace transform to the integral equation in 1906. He submitted a detailed report on integral equations in 1911 to the British association for the advancement of science. Horace Lamb in his 1910 paper solved an integral equation 
:formula_1 
as a double integral, but in his footnote he says, &quot;Mr. H. Bateman, to whom I submitted the question, has obtained a simpler solution in the form&quot; 
:formula_2.

In 1914, Bateman published &quot;The Mathematical Analysis of Electrical and Optical Wave-motion&quot;. As Murnaghan says, this book &quot;is unique and characteristic of the man. Into less than 160 small pages is crowded a wealth of information which would take an expert year to digest.&quot;
The following year he published a textbook &quot;Differential Equations&quot;, and sometime later &quot;Partial differential equations of mathematical physics&quot;. Bateman is also author of &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot; and &quot;Numerical integration of differential equations&quot;. Bateman studied the Burgers&#x27; equation long before Jan Burgers started to study.

Harry Bateman wrote two significant articles on the history of applied mathematics: &quot;The influence of tidal theory upon the development of mathematics&quot;, and &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s work in dynamics and its influence on modern thought&quot;.

In his &quot;Mathematical Analysis of Electrical and Optical Wave-motion&quot; (p. 131), he describes the charged-corpuscle trajectory as follows:

This figure of speech is not to be confused with a string in physics, for the universes in string theory have dimensions inflated beyond four, something not found in Bateman&#x27;s work. Bateman went on to study the luminiferous aether with an article &quot;The structure of the Aether&quot;. His starting point is the bivector form of an electromagnetic field, formula_3. He recalled Alfred-Marie Liénard&#x27;s electromagnetic fields, and then distinguished another type he calls &quot;aethereal fields&quot;:
Bateman received many honours for his contributions, including election to the American Philosophical Society in 1924, election to the Royal Society of London in 1928, and election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1930. He was elected as vice-president of the American Mathematical Society in 1935 and was the Society&#x27;s Gibbs Lecturer for 1943. He was on his way to New York to receive an award from the Institute of Aeronautical Science when he died of coronary thrombosis. The &quot;Harry Bateman Research Instructorships&quot; at the California Institute of Technology is named in his honour.

After his death, his notes on higher transcendental functions were edited by Arthur Erdélyi, Wilhelm Magnus, , and Francesco G. Tricomi, and published in 1953.

==Publications==
In a review of Bateman&#x27;s book &quot;Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics&quot;, Richard Courant says that &quot;there is no other work which presents the analytical tools and the results achieved by means of them equally completely and with as many original contributions&quot; and also &quot;advanced students and research workers alike will read it with great benefit&quot;.

<text>The A59 is a major road in England which is around long and runs from Wallasey, Merseyside to York, North Yorkshire. The alignment formed part of the Trunk Roads Act 1936, being then designated as the A59. It is a key route connecting Merseyside at the M53 motorway to Yorkshire, passing through three counties and connecting to various major motorways. The road is a combination of historical routes combined with contemporary roads and a mixture of dual and single carriageway. Some sections of the A59 in Yorkshire closely follow the routes of Roman roads, some dating back to the Middle Ages as salt roads, whilst much of the A59 in Merseyside follows Victorian routes which are largely unchanged to the present day.

Numerous bypasses have been constructed throughout the 20th century, one of the earliest being the Maghull bypass in the early 1930s, particularly where traffic through towns was congested. Portions of the route through Lancashire were proposed to be upgraded to motorway standard during the mid-20th century, latterly being downgraded to significant improvements then ultimately withdrawn from consideration. Sections of the road have previously been noted as being amongst the most dangerous in the country, particularly in Yorkshire, despite continued efforts to improve road safety.

==Route==
===Merseyside===
The A59 starts in Wallasey at the northern end of the M53 motorway and heading through the Kingsway Tunnel. In the centre of Liverpool, a separate spur heads north from the roundabout junction at the entrance of the Queensway Tunnel, joining the main route at Scotland Road in Vauxhall. It continues north through Kirkdale and Walton, passing Aintree Racecourse and Ormskirk Road (forming the boundary between Aintree and Netherton), before reaching Switch Island junction where it meets the A5036, M57 motorway and the M58 motorway. From Switch Island, the A59 travels through Maghull and Lydiate, into Lancashire through Aughton and thence to Ormskirk, roughly parallel to the Merseyrail Northern Line path.

===Lancashire===
At Ormskirk, it reverts from a dual to single carriageway on an old bypass. The road follows through Burscough and Rufford, despite a bypass being considered for this section in the early 1980s, before reaching the A565 at Tarleton. The road continues over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and River Douglas through to Longton (and Hutton) bypass, where it returns to dual carriageway. Passing Lancashire Police HQ, the road bypasses Penwortham and continues across the River Ribble into Preston, by-passing the city centre via Ring Way, where the A583 from Blackpool converges. It briefly merges with the A6 before heading East and meeting the M6 at junction 31, after which the road splits into two separate carriageways until it meets the A677 for Blackburn.

The A59 continues through Myerscough Smithy then runs around the perimeter of Samlesbury Aerodrome (a British Aerospace installation). At Longsight Road, it passes through Salesbury until meeting A666, at which point it bypasses Billington, Whalley then Clitheroe, Chatburn and the village of Sawley before reaching Gisburn.

===Yorkshire===

From Horton it enters North Yorkshire and goes through West and East Marton before meeting the A56, after which the road passes Broughton. Past Broughton, the road meets the Skipton bypass at its western end, where it overlaps the A65 on its route between Kendal and Leeds, de-merging with the A65 further to the east. The road continues over the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway through a roundabout junction with the B6160 before rising up Beamsley hill. At the top of the hill, the road crosses into the Harrogate district, at which points there is a long narrow, twisting descent, known as Kex Gill, that leads to Blubberhouses village.
The A59 then runs along the head of Fewston Reservoir and follows the route of a Roman road past the &#x27;golf balls&#x27; at Menwith Hill, an RAF station. As Skipton Road, the A59 then declines towards Harrogate passing Kettlesing. Reaching Harrogate as Skipton Road, it meets the A61 Ripon Road for Ripon, Harrogate town centre and Leeds, before continuing through the suburbs of the town as Skipton Road. This section of the A59 is widely considered to be one of the busiest roads in North Yorkshire. Part of this section travels across the Stray, an act-protected tract of grassy land which horseshoes around the town centre. The A59 then turns left at the Empress Roundabout, which is itself on the Stray, towards the suburb of Starbeck, although traffic travelling towards York is directed onto the A661 Wetherby Road to utilise the A658 Harrogate and Knaresborough Southern Bypass. The A59, however, continues to travel through Starbeck as Knaresborough Road and later High Street, then heads east to Knaresborough, passing through the town centre before heading towards York as York Road.

The remainder of the route is comparatively flat. From Knaresborough, the A59 meets up with York-directed traffic from Harrogate on the A658, and skirts to the north of Goldsborough towards the A1(M). The A59 heads towards York, travelling close to such places as Nun Monkton, Moor Monkton and Upper Poppleton before crossing Holgate Bridge and finally ending just to the south of the city walls at a zebra crossing at the junction of Tadcaster Road and Nunnery Lane, the A1036.

==History==
===Early history===
The A59 in Yorkshire from Green Hammerton to York follows the path of an old Roman road known locally as Watling Street and may in Medieval times have been used as a salt road. Archaeological digging in 2008 showed the Roman road crossing the River Nidd on an old county bridge prior to diverging north-east of Green Hammerton, contrary to previous understanding of the route. Evidence of ditches earlier than the Roman conquest of Britain were also uncovered during the archaeological dig in 2008, suggesting a road network present in the area dating back to the Iron Age.

===19th century===
Much of the present-day Merseyside alignment is unchanged over the last century, with the route through Liverpool to Switch Island junction in Aintree utilising existing road infrastructure from the Victorian era, such as Scotland Road. The present day alignment between Switch Island junction and Aughton, Lancashire via Maghull was non-existent prior to the 20th century, with the connecting roads being typically smaller lanes which still exist today. The A59&#x27;s Ormskirk junction with the B5195 Turnpike Road is where the A59&#x27;s continues along its Victorian alignment, known as &quot;Hollborn Hill&quot; before continuing through Ormskirk and West Lancashire.
In Clitheroe district prior to the opening of the new Chatburn road in 1827 the main Liverpool / Skipton route ran through Clitheroe town via Whalley road and Pimlico over the limestone ridge of Chatburn Old road. The original route in Sawley village skirted the River Ribble from Smithies bridge and may have used the relatively steep &amp; narrow brow from near the Spread Eagle pub, alongside the River Ribble, prior to today&#x27;s route the A59 ran up from Southport House.

===20th century===
The route from Liverpool to Leeds via Preston was one of many roads across the country to be designated a trunk road in the Trunk Roads Act 1936, being given the designation &quot;A59&quot; and encompassing the alignment from Liverpool to Skipton. The route fell within the first schedule of the act, which also included around of road to be trunked and designated.

This century saw the vast majority of the A59&#x27;s bypasses constructed, some of which were built before trunking, including a bypass of Ormskirk town centre in Lancashire, which appeared on maps from 1929 onwards as &quot;Byepass Road&quot; and subsequently forming the A59. Numerous additional bypasses were built after the road was trunked, to realign the A59 away from routes where it may have previously travelled through busy towns and cities. One of the earliest examples is in Lancashire with the &quot;Longton Bypass&quot;, which was constructed during 1956–57 at an estimated cost of £491,000 (). Prior to the bypass, the A59 travelled through the villages of Walmer Bridge, Longton and Hutton before being realigned to their east.
In Yorkshire at Beamsley Hill, there are two lanes east-bound (on an incline) and a single lane west-bound, some of which was improved at various points during the late 20th century, such as in Hazlewood, where the A59 was rerouted to become a largely straight road, bypassing the now older winding route which exists to its north-west. The A59 was also rerouted just to the east of the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway during the same period, requiring construction of a new Bolton Bridge over the River Wharfe, with the former alignment now forming a bridleway.

Up until the early 1970s, the start of the A59 was in the centre of Liverpool; this now forms a small spur connecting to the present day A59, which runs through the Kingsway Tunnel from its start point in Wallasey. The Birkenhead alignment of the A59 utilises a disused railway cutting to link the road up to the M53 motorway. In Lancashire, the A59 was realigned during the same period in the early 1970s, to bypass the towns of Clitheroe / Whalley plus the villages of Chatburn &amp; Sawley. The Chatburn section includes a deep limestone cutting with the Downham road bridge overhead. Most of it was constructed as a single-carriageway despite parliamentary concerns that it would be less safe than a dual-carriageway. The Sawley brow section was 3 lanes with overtaking both ways, but following several serious accidents, is now only overtaking allowed on the uphill east-bound side. The bypass had been confirmed the year before at an estimated cost of £3.4 million ().
The A59 stretch of the Skipton Bypass was opened in 1981 at an estimated cost of £16.4 million (), crossing the B6265 north of the town and providing relief to traffic congestion.
The A59 was upgraded to primary status during the 1990s due to its increased perceived importance as an east–west route. This stretch of the route was claimed in 2004 to be one of the busiest roads in North Yorkshire.

Whilst now skirting to the north of Goldsborough towards the A1(M), originally the route went through the village of Flaxby and onto Allerton, but the route now travels a restricted east–west route and meets the A1(M) at its junction 47. The road originally ended to the south of Green Hammerton, with the A66 routed down from Boroughbridge and going into York.

==Bypass improvements==
The A59 in Yorkshire was part of North Yorkshire&#x27;s 30-year transport plan in 2016, including maintenance of potholes and resurfacing works, as well as the potential construction of new routes.

Numerous sections of the route have been realigned at various stages, particularly where the previous alignment had travelled through busy villages or towns. Most have been constructed since the route was trunked and designated the A59, however some parts, such as the Maghull bypass, had been constructed prior to the Trunk Roads Act 1936.

===List of A59 bypasses===
===Kex Gill Bypass proposal===

A bypass has been proposed for the Kex Gill section of road that spans from Blubberhouses to the top of Beamsley Hill. The road has been closed on many occasions since 2010 (particularly in 2016 when it was closed for 8 weeks for emergency repair work). It was closed again due to a landslip in May 2018 and local planners have stated that a new section of road should be built to the north of the current route on the other side of a very small and narrow valley. North Yorkshire County Council have stated that they will start to construct the £30 million bypass in spring 2020. At the same time, they revealed that the closure and repairs bill for the section of the A59 at Kex gill was over £3 million for the period of 2009–2018. Plans for a bypass were submitted in December 2019, with the cost expected to be around £43.7 million.

==Motorway proposals==

A bypass road for Ormskirk and Burscough respectively was first proposed as part of James Drake&#x27;s &quot;1949 Road Plan for Lancashire&quot;, described as an all-purpose road but later considered to be a potential motorway by 1958 and given the designation of A59(M). By 1963, Lancashire County Council had dropped the plans for a motorway of this nature, instead deciding to focus later efforts during the mid-1970s on proposing a scheme to improve the A59 link between Liverpool and Preston. This proposal was at the time considered to potentially become the M59 motorway, with investigations into all practical options being considered, however the motorway was ultimately never constructed. A map published by Lancashire County Council and dated 1974 shows the suggested route of the motorway, starting at the missing M58 motorway junction 2 and continuing north-bound towards Blackpool along the alignment of the A59. However, the road could still happen after the completion of the Preston Western Distributor Road (A582) in July 2023.

==Road safety==
The A59 has persistently featured in the top 10 most dangerous roads in Britain. A report by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2004 branded a section of road between the towns of Skipton and Harrogate as being &quot;the most hazardous primary route in the nation&quot;, suggesting that the cost to implement safety measures to reduce the number of incidents could be in the region of £3 million. North Yorkshire County Council claimed they were taking steps to reduce fatalities on the road and that accidents on the stretch in question was still too high, despite the number of accidents in 2003 being at its lowest in six years. The newspaper had also reported on the lives of those who have lost loved ones on the road.

In 2008 European Road Assessment Programme reported the risk of being involved in a death or disabling injury accident as being between Low-medium and Medium-high depending on the section of road travelled. There were renewed calls in 2017 to improve the A59 in Ribble Valley, Lancashire, with MP Nigel Evans describing the A59 as a &quot;dangerous road&quot; whilst requesting the police carry out a full audit of accidents in an effort to tackle the problem. A proposal to improve safety of the road between Skipton and Harrogate, which is the only direct route between the towns, was discussed by councillors in March 2017. Numerous possible re-alignments are being considered in an effort to minimize or eradicate the impact of road closures, which has cost the council almost £1 million.

==Junctions and landmarks==
There are numerous junctions along the route of the A59, including motorway and other A-road junctions. Major junctions and landmarks are listed below.

<text>The A63 is a major road in Yorkshire, England between Leeds and Kingston upon Hull. A section between North Cave and Hull forms the eastward continuation of the M62 motorway and is part of the unsigned Euroroute E20.

==Route==
=== Leeds to Howden ===


The route from Leeds out to Selby runs roughly parallel, and between south of the route of the Leeds and Selby Railway.

The route begins just east of Leeds city centre at a junction with the A61, although, before its February 2009 realignment along the new East Leeds Link Road, it began at a junction with the A64 in the Halton Moor area of the city (now signed as the B6159). The road passes through the Knowsthorpe and Cross Green areas, as &quot;Pontefract Lane&quot;; despite being of dual carriageway standard, this stretch is subject to a 40 mph speed limit, and incorporates peak-time HOV lanes. At the end of this dual carriageway section, the route meets the M1, and the road continues north along the motorway for one junction then resumes as the A63.

From junction 46 of the M1, the Thorpe Park roundabout, the route continues east, meeting the A642 at Garforth. There is a turning for &quot;Lidgett Lane&quot; (B6137) to the left, next to Garforth Academy, with the Shell garage on the right. It crosses the Leeds Country Way (a former railway), and there is the B6137 to the right for Kippax. On the Garforth/Micklefield parish boundary is a roundabout with the A656 Roman Ridge.

At the Boot and Shoe junction, with the former A1, there is the Esso &quot;Boot &amp; Shoe Service Station&quot;, and the Best Western &quot;Milford Hotel&quot;. There is a grade-separated left turn for the B1222 (for Sherburn-in-Elmet). This dual-carriageway section of the former A1, follows the Leeds – North Yorkshire boundary (Ledsham and South Milford), and was built as part of the Brotherton-Micklefield scheme in November 1964 by Dowsett Engineering Construction. At the Selby Fork junction south of the Selby Fork Hotel, the A1246 continues southwards along the former A1, and the road enters the former district of Selby, in North Yorkshire.

It crosses the A1(M) at junction 42 at South Milford. It meets the A162 at a roundabout, crosses a railway, and passes through Monk Fryston. It follows Causeway Dike and passes through Hambleton, where to the east it crosses the Selby Diversion of the East Coast Main Line, and the A1238 (former A63) at a roundabout. The route follows the six-mile £44 million Selby Bypass and £5 million Barlby Bypass, the latter of which is shared with the north–south A19, although the A19 still passes through Selby itself. On the bypass the road passes Selby Golf Club, meets the A19 at a roundabout at Brayton, crosses the Selby Canal, crosses the Doncaster-Selby railway, meets the A1041 at a roundabout, and crosses the River Ouse on the River Ouse swing bridge and the Selby-Hull railway. The short section around Barlby follows what was the old East Coast Main Line railway before the Selby Diversion opened in the early 1980s. An alternative route eastwards from the Selby bypass, to the M62, is the A1041 via Camblesforth, then the A645 past Drax power station. The route out to Hull is shadowed by the Selby-Hull railway line.

It leaves at the Barlby Roundabout (completed May 2013; formerly a dangerous road junction) to the right, passing Osgodby then over the railway line and passes Hemingbrough. A planned bypass at Osgodby (2002) was cancelled due to increases in prices of land. It crosses the River Derwent and enters the East Riding of Yorkshire. It passes through Newsholme before bypassing Howden to the west, as Barnhill Lane and Boothferry Road, where it meets the A614 at a roundabout. Access to the M62 is via junction 37 to the south, along the A614.

East of Howden, the A63 has been downgraded and is now the B1230. The B1230 carries non-motorway traffic over the M62 motorway and onwards into Gilberdyke. When the B1230 was the A63, a three-mile section, through Gilberdyke and Newport, was dual carriageway. Where the B1230 crosses the M62 motorway east of Newport, the M62 finishes and the A63 restarts. Before the last eastern section of the M62 was built, the motorway terminated at a temporary junction at Balkholme. Before the M62 opened, the single carriageway A63 was Hull&#x27;s main route to the South of England, causing many bottlenecks.

=== North Cave to Hull ===

The section from junction 38 of the M62 (its terminus) to the A1034 junction near South Cave was single carriageway before the M62 opened in May 1976. The section was constructed as the dualling of the Caves Bypass and opened when the last eastern section of the M62 opened, completing the dual carriageway link to the outskirts of Hull. The £2 million contract was given to Clugston, and work started in February 1975. From junction 38, the B1230 leads to North Cave (and in the direction of Beverley) along the former A63. The BP &quot;Triangle North Cave&quot; is alongside the junction.

There is the Beacon Service Area on the eastbound side, with a Travelodge &quot;Hull South Cave&quot; and Shell &quot;Beacon&quot;, situated just south of Everthorpe and Wolds prisons. The road skirts the southern edge of South Cave, and near Ellerker it crosses the former route (and Ermine Street from Brough, then known as Petuaria, to York) at the A1034 junction.

The Elloughton bypass was built in October 1971, from the A1034 to the Welton/Brough junction passing Brantingham to the west. It replaced the former road through Elloughton and Brough. This section skirts the southern edge of the Yorkshire Wolds. The £1,629,850 contract for 3.25 miles was given on 10 October 1969 to Gleeson Civil Engineering; the site office was on Brantingham Road; the eastbound carriageway opened on Sunday 21 March 1971; part of the dual section opened on Monday 13 September 1971; the bypass fully opened on Friday 29 October 1971.

The Welton/Brough – North Ferriby section opened in the late summer of 1963. Martin Cowley Ltd, of Derbyshire, was given the £156,947 contract in August 1961 for the two-mile section. At the Elloughton-cum-Brough-Welton parish boundary, there is a grade-separated junction for Brough to the south and Welton to the north. The road passes on the south side of South Hunsley School (with a leisure centre) at Melton, part of the parish of Welton.

A new grade separated junction was constructed east of Melton near North Ferriby in 2006/7. The Shell &quot;Grand Dale&quot; filling station is on the westbound side, west of the Melton interchange. The Yorkshire Wolds Way crosses at this point.

The North Ferriby bypass and North Ferriby – Hessle sections opened in 1961. Martin Cowley Ltd of Clay Cross, in Derbyshire, was given the contract for the two-mile bypass, for £281,851 in August 1959, to take 20 months from October 1959; it was opened on Friday 25 August 1961. The former route is partly the B1231 (for Swanland). The road meets the A15 at a grade-separated junction. The former route, before the South Docks Road improvement, followed the current A1105 into Hull.

The road continues through the Humber Bridge Country Park, across the Hull-Selby railway, and under the Humber Bridge. The Humber Bridge was designed to take some of Hull&#x27;s traffic southwards, but the vast majority takes the A63 westwards, towards the M18. The road passes on the south side of Hessle, next to Hessle railway station, and follows the Hull to Selby railway line closely on the southern side as far as the outskirts of Hull near the western docks.

=== Within Kingston upon Hull ===
The section from Hessle into Kingston upon Hull is named &quot;Clive Sullivan Way&quot;, after the rugby league footballer Clive Sullivan, (originally titled the &quot;South Docks Road&quot;). There is a junction with &quot;Priory Way&quot;, and at Gipsyville it meets the A1166 at a grade-separated roundabout near St Andrew&#x27;s Quay. Near the Albert Dock, there is a fly-over where it rejoins the former &quot;Hessle Road&quot; next to the Smith &amp; Nephew factory to the south.

====Castle Street====

The A63 meets the A1079 (for central Hull) at a junction, beyond which the road is named &quot;Castle Street&quot;. The Castle Street section of the road (2011) had significant air pollution problems (NO2 levels), with over 55,000 vehicles per day, and had heavy congestion, having been at full capacity for around a decade; much of the traffic is heavy goods vehicles originating as a result of Ro-Ro activity at Hull Docks. The road section also was experiencing high accident levels, as well as forming a barrier to local north–south movement within the city centre. Improvement schemes for the road had been planned since the 1980s, but were subject to funding delays.

Consultation on the design of a solution began 2009. Split level junctions including passing under or over the A63 were considered for the bottleneck at the Mytongate roundabout, with additional congestion easing measures, and pedestrian bridges. Other options included an extended viaduct and tunnel options – the consultation showed a preference for an underground solution. In March 2010 the Highways Agency established a preferred scheme – the A63 would be lowered at the Mytongate bottleneck, and the north south connecting roads raised slightly (), creating a split level junction; additionally the eastbound carriageway would be widened, and pedestrian crossings created. If funded, construction was planned to begin in 2016 for completion in 2019. The cost has been estimated at between £150 and £200 million. In May 2012 the design and consultation work was initiated. In June 2013 the government announced the go ahead for a £160 million improvement to the road after 2015. From 2021, work began on Mytongate, and is predicted to be finished in 2025. A bridge called Murdoch&#x27;s Connection was also constructed further east than the junction between the Princes Quay Shopping Centre and Hull Marina which allows for safe pedestrian crossing and fewer traffic lights, as well as greater connection between the main city centre area to the upmarket Humber Street area of the city centre.

====Roger Millward Way====

It crosses the River Hull at Myton Swing Bridge, near the River Hull tidal surge barrier and The Deep. The stretch over Myton Bridge and within the ward of Drypool is known as Roger Millward Way. It was originally named Garrison Road but the name was changed to Roger Millward Way in memory of the deceased rugby player in 2018. Within Drypool there is a northwards junction with the A1165 (Great Union Street), and southwards junction connecting the Victoria Dock Village housing estate at the same point. The road terminates at a junction for the A1033 (&quot;Hedon Road&quot;). It is prone to congestion due to traffic from the Port of Hull and vehicles exiting Victoria Dock heading into the city centre.

==Proposed diversion==
A proposal to divert the road along a causeway between Hessle and Hull Docks was unveiled in 2019. The £1.5 billion project would have a dual carriageway road veering into the estuary and take all of the through traffic from the A63 away from the centre of Hull.

<text>The bluish-grey saltator or Amazonian grey saltator (Saltator coerulescens) is a passerine bird in the tanager family Thraupidae that is widespread in semi-open habitats in tropical and subtropical South America.

Two of its former subspecies groups, &quot;grandis&quot; (of Mexico and Central America) and &quot;olivascens&quot; (of northern South America and Trinidad), are now recognized as separate species, the cinnamon-bellied saltator and the olive-grey (or Caribbean grey) saltator.

==Taxonomy==
The bluish-grey saltator was formally described in 1817 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot under the binomial name &quot;Saltator coerulescens&quot;. Vieillot based his description on the &quot;Habia de la Ceja Blanca&quot; that Félix de Azara had described in 1802 in his book on birds in Paraguay and the Río de la Plata. The specific epithet &quot;coerulescens&quot; is derived from Latin and means &quot;bluish&quot;.

&quot;Saltator coerulescens&quot; was formerly known as the greyish saltator and included two subspecies groups: &quot;grandis&quot; (including &quot;brevicaudus&quot;, &quot;hesperis&quot;, &quot;plumbiceps&quot;, &quot;vigorsii&quot; and &quot;yucatanensis&quot;) and &quot;olivascens&quot; (including &quot;brewsteri&quot; and &quot;plumbeus&quot;). In 2021, they were recognized as separate species, the cinnamon-bellied saltator (&quot;S. grandis&quot;) and olive-grey (or Caribbean grey) saltator (&quot;S. olivascens&quot;). With these as separate species, &quot;S. coerulescens&quot; includes the subspecies &quot;azarae&quot;, &quot;mutus&quot; and &quot;superciliaris&quot;.

==Description==
On average, the bluish-grey saltator is 20 cm long and weighs 52 g. The plumage depends on age and subspecies, but in general this bird has grey or greyish-olive upperparts, a white stripe over the eye, a narrow white throat, a grey breast and a buff or cinnamon belly.

The common call is a long-drawn upward slur, &quot;ch&#x27;wheeet&quot; or &quot;ch&#x27;kweeee&quot;, sometimes with a more elaborate beginning, as &quot;hi&#x27;whee chu weeeeh&quot;. The song is a warble, usually fairly short, varying from nasal to mellow.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species occurs in a wide range of semi-open habitats, such as woodlands, scrub and edges of forest (it avoids the interior of dense forests) in tropical and subtropical South America, including northern Argentina, western Uruguay, Paraguay, widely in Brazil (being replaced by the olive-grey saltator in the extreme north near the borders with the Guianas and Venezuela), Bolivia, eastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, and southeastern Colombia (being replaced by the olive-grey saltator in central and northern parts of the country).

==Behaviour and ecology==
The bluish-grey saltator feeds on fruits, buds and slow-moving arthropods. It forages at low and middle levels, sometimes in pairs or small groups and sometimes with mixed-species flocks that may include other saltators.
The two pale blue subelliptic eggs per clutch measure some 23–31.5 mm long by about 17–22 mm wide and weigh about 5 grams each. They look unusual for this genus as they have a circle of blackish-brown hairstreaks and dots around the blunt end. They are laid in a bulky cup nest 2–4 m high in a tree.

<text>Charles Nicolas Joseph Justin Favart (17 March 1749 in Paris – 1 or 2 February 1806) was a French playwright at the Comédie-Italienne for two decades. Favard was also an actor at the Comédie Française for fifteen years. Usually known as Nicolas Favart, formally Charles-Nicolas Favart or C.-N. Favart, he was simply Favart fils (Favart Jr) in his time.

Favart was the son of the dramatist, Charles Simon Favart, and was himself a playwright. He wrote a number of successful opéras comiques, such as &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot; (1782) and &quot;Le Mariage singulier&quot; (1787). His son Antoine-Pierre-Charles Favart (1780–1867) was in the diplomatic service, and assisted in editing his grandfather&#x27;s memoirs; he was a playwright and painter as well.

<text>The Brunswick Centre is a grade II listed residential and shopping centre in Bloomsbury, London, England. It is located between Brunswick Square and Russell Square and is administratively in the London Borough of Camden.

==Planning and design==
The centre replaced streets of run-down Georgian era terrace housing. It was designed by Patrick Hodgkinson in the mid-1960s, based on studies by Leslie Martin. It was initially planned as a private development at a time when private, mixed-use development in the UK was rare. Building started in 1967 and was completed in 1972, though the building fell some way short of its intended size. The original plan extended up to Euston Road but the Ministry of Defence would not release the site of a building they leased for use by the Territorial Army (and that still stands next to the Centre today).

After failing to attract sufficient private buyers on time, the residential section was leased to the London Borough of Camden for use as council housing, while the developer retained ownership of the structure and shopping areas. The exterior of the building was never painted because the Borough could not afford to complete work on the building after they took control. In Hodgkinson&#x27;s design, the blocks would have been painted cream, a shade typical of the Georgian period, as a homage to the terraced houses that previously stood on the site and those that still surround it.

==21st century==

Despite being widely disliked by those who are unsympathetic to modernist architecture, it was listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England in 2000.
By this time, however, many of its shop premises were unoccupied. Plans for renovation had repeatedly been blocked by residents&#x27; committees but in November 2002, the £22 million project began. This included the painting of the blocks in their originally-planned colour and the commissioning of artist Susanna Heron to introduce water features to the central space. The major work was completed in late 2006 with the opening of branches of several high street chain stores and restaurants. The dual management has caused problems though, as the landlord restored the structure of the estate but the council is responsible for maintenance of the residential properties – so while the concrete structure was restored, the windows remained untouched, detracting from the overall aesthetic of the development. In 2007, the council started work on replacing the windows.

Now referring to itself as The Brunswick, the centre contains 560 flats, various shops, cafés and restaurants, a Waitrose supermarket, and a Curzon cinema.

==Appearances in popular culture==
The centre is regularly used as a location for films, TV, photography and music videos including &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Stuff&quot;,
&quot;The Comic Strip&quot;, &quot;Crime Traveller&quot;, &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s skateboarders trailer and Egg Card&#x27;s guinea pig advertisement.

* Jack Nicholson strolls along the concourse and down the main staircase (now demolished) in the 1975 film &quot;The Passenger&quot;.
*The 2022 series set in the Star Wars universe &quot;Andor&quot; filmed Coruscant scenes at the centre.
* Mansun&#x27;s music video for &quot;Wide Open Space&quot; was filmed at the centre.
* Lodger wrote a song dedicated to the building.

<doc id="531140" wikidata="Q4649170" url="?curid=531140" title="A35 road">
<text>The A35 is a major road in southern England, connecting Honiton in Devon and Southampton in Hampshire. It is a trunk road for some of its length. Most of its route passes through Dorset and the New Forest. It originally connected Exeter and Southampton, the original A35 ran along what is now the A3052 joining the present road at Charmouth.

==Route==

Beginning in Honiton at the eastern junction with the A30 road, the A35 travels in a roughly south-easterly direction past Axminster, Charmouth and Bridport. After Bridport, there is a section of dual carriageway, before it reaches its bypass around Dorchester. After Dorchester, there are approximately of dual carriageway, including the Puddletown bypass, until it reaches its roundabout with the A31 road at Bere Regis. Continuing roughly south-easterly still, it becomes dual carriageway again near Upton, before returning to a single carriageway through Poole and Bournemouth, apart from a small section of dual carriageway on Wessex Way. On reaching Christchurch, there is a dual-carriageway bypass. It then heads in a north-easterly direction through the New Forest, passing through Lyndhurst where it meets the A337 road (to Lymington). It continues through Ashurst and Totton, meeting the A36 road and M271 motorway at grade separated junctions. It then turns north-east, acting as the western part of Southampton&#x27;s ring road, with the A27 road making up the eastern part. It terminates at Swaythling, on the northern outskirts of Southampton.

==History==
===1922 - Road classification===
The road number was created with the 1922 classification of roads in the United Kingdom. At that time its western terminus was on the then A30 in Heavitree, Exeter. In 1966 the section from Charmouth to Exeter was de-trunked and renumbered to A3052, with the A35 directed over the former A373 to Honiton, terminating at the then-new A30 Honiton Bypass. This added the narrow long Charmouth Tunnel to the route, built in 1832 to avoid the summit of Thistle Hill.

===1987/88 - Building of Dorchester and Bridport Bypasses===
The A35 is a main route along England&#x27;s south coast, and was congested. To help solve the congestion, sections of the A35 were upgraded between Honiton and Poole. In 1969 the Ministry of Transport recorded the case for bypasses around Bridport and Dorchester. The bypass to the south of Bridport opened almost two decades later in 1987, followed by the bypass to the south of Dorchester in 1988.

===1990/91 - Building of Axminster and Charmouth Village Bypasses===
Following the re-routing onto the former A373 road, a major traffic bottleneck was the town of Axminster. A much-desired southern bypass for the town was indefinitely postponed in 1980 by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Kenneth Clarke. The project was eventually authorized by Act of Parliament in 1987, with construction beginning in 1990 approximately following the line of a Roman road. Charmouth village was bypassed in 1991, with the Charmouth Tunnel bypassed at the same time. The defunct tunnel was converted into a shooting range in 2010.

===1999 - Puddletown Bypass===
The Puddletown dual carriageway bypass which opened in 1999 (together with the A30 Honiton-Exeter dualling) were financed under a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) contract running from 1996 to 2026.

===2004-2007 - Road straightening between Slepe and Upton===
An on-line straightening between Slepe and the Upton bypass was carried out in 2004, and the extension of the speed limit west of Slepe by in 2007.

===Bournemouth Centenary Way diversion===
In Bournemouth, it has been diverted around the Sovereign Centre of Boscombe along Centenary Way resulting in a concurrency with the A338; much of its former route is now pedestrianised.

==Junction list==














==Incidents==
In May 2021, a sinkhole opened on the carriageway following emergency repairs to a pothole on the A35 Puddletown bypass near the junction for Troytown. The road was closed to allow remedial works to be carried out.

In October 2021 the edge of the eastbound carriageway collapsed into a field where the A35 ascends an escarpment east of Honiton. Due to the complex ground conditions repairs took 8 months to complete with temporary signals controlling single-file traffic for that time.

<text>Thomas A. Gaudette (1923–1998) was a community organizer who worked in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. Originally a businessman, Gaudette became interested in neighborhood organizing through his Catholic Church activism. Gaudette helped form a neighborhood group, along the lines of those organized by Saul Alinsky, on the far West Side of Chicago called Organization for a Better Austin. OBA was concerned with poor schools and neighborhood decline.

He also founded the Mid-America Institute for Community Organizations, and trained notable organizers like Shel Trapp and Gale Cincotta.

==Biography==
Thomas A. Gaudette was born in 1923, in Medford, Massachusetts. His parents were Roman Catholic and his father a member of a railroad union, two critical influences on Tom Gaudette&#x27;s later development as a community organizer. Gaudette served with distinction in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, surviving the famous raid on Ploesti, Romania, and by war&#x27;s end earning the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, and a Presidential Unit Citation. After the war, he graduated in 1949 from Boston College.

By the 1950s Tom Gaudette and his wife Kay had settled in Chicago, where he worked as a vice-president for the Admiral Corporation. Here, he was introduced to community organizing, for his new home had become a center of community organizing because of the work of Saul Alinsky and the Roman Catholic Church.

Experienced in labor organizing and trained in sociology, Saul Alinsky (1909–1972) inspired the community organizing movement in the United States. Alinsky-style community organizing is dedicated to creating grass-roots organizations led by local people with the end of combating government bureaucracies or businesses or other powers unresponsive to local concerns. The organizer, in the classic Alinsky sense, does not assume leadership of community organizations. Instead, he or she may inspire local communities to action, but the organizer&#x27;s real job is to identify leaders who can direct the community organizations, so that communities themselves can truly determine their own direction. The Alinsky maxim &quot;Never do for the people what they can do for themselves&quot; aptly expresses this approach to community organizing. Identified with neither socialist thought nor the New Left of the 1960s, community organizing is thus a populist movement possessed of a profound faith in the democratic abilities of local communities to control their destiny. A major correlative belief is that, when local communities themselves address their problems, social justice and true democracy are realized.

In 1939, Alinsky successfully organized the Back of the Yards neighborhood in the slums of the stockyards area of Chicago. His Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council successfully fought for major civic improvements and stands as a landmark success in the history of Alinsky&#x27;s organizing. It still exists today. An important reason for the success of Alinsky and the Back of the Yards Council was the strong support of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicago, with its advocacy of social activism. Auxiliary Bishop Bernard Sheil championed Alinsky&#x27;s work in the Back of the Yards, and such other notable Chicago Roman Catholic Church leaders as Cardinal Samuel Stritch and Monsignor John Egan would continue to provide him with invaluable moral and financial support. In short, Alinsky&#x27;s methods of community organizing would be rooted in socially active churches, most notably Roman Catholic.

It was in this context that Tom Gaudette entered community organizing in Chicago. Active in their Roman Catholic parish, Tom and Kay Gaudette&#x27;s involvement in the Christian Family Movement led to their joining the Chatham-Avalon Park Community Council in 1957. Tom Gaudette emerged as a leader of this organization, serving as its president and spokesman in fights over such issues as zoning restrictions and controls on taverns in Chatham-Avalon Park. Another key issue, dominant in the Chicago of the 1950s and 1960s, was the African-American integration of white, often ethnic, neighborhoods, with subsequent white flight to the suburbs. Through his work in these areas, Gaudette met Father Egan, who, as head of the Chicago Archdiocesan Conservation Council concerned with integration, was beginning his rise in the ranks of Roman Catholic social activism. Impressed with Guadette&#x27;s character and leadership abilities, Egan believed him the right person to organize an area that the monsignor had targeted for such work: Chicago&#x27;s West Town, a Polish-American community. Saul Alinsky had refused Egan&#x27;s earlier request to organize the area, citing the lack of money and an organizer to carry out the work. Egan responded by raising money for the project from the archdiocese and sending Gaudette to Alinsky to interview for the position of organizer for West Town. After an interview memorable for the profane give and take between the two, Alinsky hired Gaudette in 1961, leading to an eleven-year association between the men. Alinsky schooled Gaudette in community organizing, making him one of the handful of organizers whom Alinsky personally trained.

Gaudette went to work for Alinsky on Chicago&#x27;s west side, organizing the Northwest Community Organization (NCO) in 1961, one of the hallmark Alinsky community organizations in Chicago. NCO, under Gaudette&#x27;s tutelage, fought the extensive demolition of housing planned for the area because of urban renewal. After working with NCO, Gaudette, at the request of Father Egan and other clergy, turned his attention to South Austin in south Chicago. His work here led to the Organization for a Better Austin (OBA) in 1966, notable for the fact that it brought together African-Americans and whites in an area tormented by racial strife. OBA had its most effective results in the improvement of the neighborhood school system.

Despite efforts by Alinsky to have him undertake organizing efforts in other cities, Gaudette refused to do so. Chicago would remain his base of operations, even after Tom Gaudette founded the Mid-America Institute for Community Development in 1972, the same year that Alinsky died. Gaudette used the Institute (operated out of his Chicago home) for his work throughout the country and even Asia as an independent trainer and teacher of community organizers. Monsignor Egan credited Tom Gaudette with inspiring more community organizers than any other person, many of whom originally worked with him. These included Gail Cincotta, who was a member of OBA, and later would become one of the more successful organizers in the United States. She, along with Shel Trapp, founded the National Training and Information Center and National People&#x27;s Action. Cincotta&#x27;s most remarkable accomplishment was her successful campaign for the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act, which the United States Congress passed in 1976. The Act banned the banking practice of &quot;redlining&quot; poor neighborhoods. Another one of Gaudette&#x27;s more important successes has been his work with John Baumann, S.J., and the Pacific Institute for Community Organization, of Oakland, which stands as one of the more active community organizing networks in the United States today. Gaudette was also responsible for community organizations in Seattle, Kansas City, and Baltimore, among other places.

On his death in 1998, Tom Gaudette left a considerable legacy to the work of community organizing, attested to by the persons he trained, as well as by his philosophy of organizing summarized in this eloquent quotation:

<text>The A45 is a major road in England. It runs east from Birmingham past the National Exhibition Centre and the M42, then bypasses Coventry and Rugby, where it briefly merges with the M45 until it continues to Daventry. It then heads to Northampton and Wellingborough before running north of Rushden and Higham Ferrers and terminating at its junction with the A14 in Thrapston.

Prior to the construction of the M6 motorway, it was the main route from the Midlands to Ipswich and to the Haven ports. When the A1-M1 link road section of the current A14 opened in 1994, most of the A45 to the east of Cambridge was re-designated as the A14 and some sections to the west were downgraded to B-roads (including the B645 between Higham Ferrers and St Neots).

==History==
The original (1923) route of the A45 was Birmingham to Ipswich. The road was extended to Felixstowe in 1935, replacing the A139. Around the same time, the A45 was rerouted around the south of Coventry when the city&#x27;s southern bypass was completed ). 

Initially, the A45 passed through Ipswich to Felixstowe; when the Ipswich bypass was completed in 1985, the road was diverted to pass over the Orwell Bridge which opened in 1982.

A bypass for the village of Eltisley was built in 1972, along with a bypass on the B1040 road. The £8 million St Neots bypass opened in December 1985 on what was then the A45. 

===Bypasses and realignments===
*Small Heath (Now bypassed to the south)
*Meriden (Now bypassed to the north)
*Coventry (An early bypass to the south)
*Daventry (The route now follows the ring road)
*Weedon Bec and Flore (Bypassed to the north)
*Northampton (Bypassed, the former route being A4500)
*Higham Ferrers (Bypassed to the west of the town)

===Re-designation===
When the new A14 link road between the A1 near Huntingdon and the M1 (at its junction with the M6) was opened to traffic in the mid-1990s, the Cambridge to Felixstowe stretch of the A45 was re-designated as the A14 (and many of the villages the route went through were bypassed) and the St Neots to Cambridge section became part of an extended A428. The route through Felixstowe at the end of the A14 is now the A154.

==Route==
===Birmingham to Dunchurch===
The road starts on the A4540 Birmingham Ring Road, bypassing Small Heath and crossing the B4145. It passes over the River Cole and meets the A4040 at a grade-separated junction at the Swan Shopping Centre in Yardley. It meets the B425 at traffic lights in Sheldon, then enters the borough of Solihull. The section of the A45 from Birmingham city centre to the M45 is all dual carriageway — urban dual carriageway with traffic lights until Birmingham Airport, then rural grade-separated between the airport and Coventry. The Bickenhill Junction (grade-separated) intersects with the B4438, a dual carriageway access road for the airport, N.E.C. and Birmingham International railway station. In December 2024 the new A4545 opened, replacing part of the southern section of the B4438, providing an alternative direct link to the M42. There is another grade-separated junction with the M42 junction 6 (three level grade separation with roundabout). On this junction, there is also access to the National Motorcycle Museum. The road meets the A452 at Stonebridge at a grade separated junction and passes over the River Blythe where the road briefly enters Warwickshire. Meriden is bypassed to the north. The Heart of England Way passes under the road, and the road enters the borough of Coventry.
The A45 becomes an urban road and skirts the south side of Coventry, crossing the A4114 near Allesley Park, the B4101 at Tile Hill, West Coast Main Line, A429 and B4113. Beyond here the road takes a more rural nature, with a grade-separated junction with the A46 and the A444 (three level roundabout with underpass for the A46 and the A444, and an overpass for the A45). Between here and the next junction, the A45 runs concurrent with the A46. The Tollbar End roundabout was one of the busiest in the Midlands. It had exits for the A46 north / Coventry Eastern Bypass, Coventry Airport and B4110. In early 2017, the Tollbar End roundabout was upgraded and the junction is now a roundabout interchange with an underpass for the A46. Crossing the River Avon, the road re-enters Warwickshire. The A423 exits to the south-east at a (grade-separated) forked junction near the former Peugeot factory. The A445 crosses at a roundabout near Ryton on Dunsmore, followed by the War Memorial Roundabout with the B4455 Fosse Way. This Portland stone memorial obelisk on the roundabout just north of Stretton-on-Dunsmore commemorates King George V&#x27;s review of the 29th Division before they were sent to Gallipoli. There is a further grade-separated junction with the A4071 and B4453 towards Rugby. The final roundabout on this section is the start of the M45 and the B4429. For , the A45 runs concurrent with the M45 until a fairly new junction beyond Dunchurch. The B4429 carried the A45 until the new junction was built.

===Dunchurch to Thrapston===

Heading towards Daventry, the road is single carriageway. The road passes two prisons: HMP Onley and HMP Rye Hill. After Willoughby, the road enters Northamptonshire, where it crosses the Oxford Canal and Grand Union Canal near Braunston. The Jurassic Way crosses the road here. The road enters Daventry and briefly runs concurrent with the A425 heading to Leamington Spa, then heads south-east on the Daventry bypass, here called the Stefen Way. The road meets the B4038 at a roundabout where the A425 exits. The road heads west past Dodford and then bypasses Weedon Bec, crossing the West Coast Main Line and Grand Union Canal and then meets the A5 at a roundabout constructed as part of the Daventry Development Link Road realignment which opened on 15 November 2018.
 This road also bypasses Flore, before meeting the grade-separated M1 Junction 16, briefly running concurrent with the M1.

The A45 resumes at M1 Junction 15 as a dual carriageway, heading around the south side of Northampton. It then meets the older route (made of sections of the A5076 and A4500) at the A45 / A508 grade-separated junction, near Northampton High School. It then crosses the River Nene and Nene Way, and after that, there is a large grade-separated junction with the A428 and the A5095). This section is concurrent with the A43, which exits at a grade-separated junction near Weston Favell. The grade-separated junction with the end of the A5076 is also the exit for Billing Aquadrome. The road has a grade-separated junction with the B573 near Earls Barton. The road then meets the Wellingborough bypass (A509) at a roundabout, although there is a segregated turn lane for westbound traffic wishing to continue on the A45. It runs concurrently with the A509 to the grade-separated junction near the bridge over the River Nene, where the A509 exits south near Irchester Country Park. East of Wellingborough, the road crosses the Midland Main Line. There is a grade-separated junction for the A5001 into Rushden and the route runs alongside the River Nene, offering a second turning to Rushden at a roundabout with the A5001 again; at this second junction, the original route to the A1 has been reclassified the B645. At the roundabout with the A6 near Higham Ferrers, it starts the follow the former route of the A605. The section of dual carriageway from the M1 now ends at the next roundabout and the route from there is now single carriageway. This is the start of the Raunds bypass. The next roundabout is with the B663. The route bypasses Ringstead and the A45 finishes at a grade-separated junction with the A14 (roundabout with overpass for the A14) near Thrapston.

<text>Marie Justine Benoîte Favart (née Duronceray) (; 15 June 1727 – 22 April 1772) was an operatic singer, actress, playwright and dancer, the wife of the dramatist, Charles Simon Favart.

==Biography==
Madame Favart is largely responsible for the 18th-century change in Parisian operatic taste from French standards to performances of a lyric type adapted from Italian models, which developed later into the genuine French comic opera. She was also a bold reformer in matters of stage costume, playing the peasant with bare arms, in wooden shoes and linen dress, and not, as heretofore, in court costume with enormous hoops, diamonds and long white kid gloves. With her husband, and other authors, she collaborated in a number of successful pieces, and one &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot; she produced alone.

Maurice, comte de Saxe, a Marshal of France and her husband&#x27;s patron, began to make advances to Mme Favart, and Favart was forced to flee. Mme Favart was established by the marshal in a house at Vaugirard; proving a fickle mistress, she was suddenly arrested and confined in a convent, where she was brought to unconditional surrender in the beginning of 1750. Before the year was out the marshal died, and Mme Favart reappeared at the Comédie Italienne, where for twenty years she was a great favourite. Among the roles created by Mme Favart were La Vieille, Robinette and Thérèse in Egidio Duni&#x27;s &quot;La fée Urgèle&quot;, which was premiered at court in 1765.

Madame Favart in fictionalised form is the title-character of Offenbach&#x27;s 1878 opéra comique, &quot;Madame Favart&quot;.

In the edition in ten volumes of the works of the couple Favart, published in 1763-1772 at Duchesne (Paris), Volume 5 is devoted exclusively to the dramatic works of Marie Justine Favart. These are the following:
*1753: &quot;Les amours de Bastien et Bastienne, parodie du Devin de village&quot;,
*1754: &quot;La feste d’amour, ou Lucas et Colinette, petite pièce en vers et en un acte&quot;,
*1757: &quot;Les encorcelés, ou Jeannot et Jeannette, parodie des Surprises de l’amour&quot;,
*1758: &quot;La fille mal gardée, ou Le pédant amoureux, parodie de la Provençale&quot;,
*1760: &quot;La fortune au village, parodie d’Églée&quot; and
*1762: &quot;Annette et Lubin, comédie en un acte et en vers&quot;.

<text>The Eurocopter AS532 Cougar (now Airbus Helicopters H215M) is a twin-engine, medium-weight, multipurpose helicopter developed by Eurocopter. The AS532 is a development and upgrade of the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma in its militarized form. Its civilian counterpart is the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma (Later called the Airbus Helicopters H215, note the lack of M suffix). The AS532 has been further developed as the Eurocopter EC725.

==Design and development==
The AS332 Super Puma, designed as a growth version to replace the SA 330 Puma, first flew in September 1977. It was fitted with two 1,330 kW Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines, composite rotor blades, improved landing gear and a modified tailfin.

In 1990 all military Super Puma designations were changed from &quot;AS 332&quot; to &quot;AS 532 Cougar&quot; to distinguish between the civil and military variants of the helicopter.

Canada had considered purchasing the Cougar to replace their CH-113 Labrador, but opted in the end to purchase the CH-149 Cormorant. In 2012 France began a €288.8m project (€11.1m/unit) to upgrade 23 Army Cougars and 3 for the Air Force to address obsolescence issues and to deliver similar avionics to their EC225 and EC725 helicopters.

==Variants==


;AS532 UL/AL
:The AS 532 UL/AL is the long version of the Cougar family and is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines. It carries a crew of 2 and up to 29 troops or 6 injured passengers on stretchers plus 10 others. As with the other versions of the Cougar, the AS 532 UL/AL can lift 4.5 tons by means of a sling. The Horizon battlefield ground surveillance system can be installed on the AS 532 UL (utility version). The AS 532 AL (armed version) can also be fitted with a variety of weapons, including pod-mounted 20 mm cannons, 68 mm rocket-launchers, and side-mounted rapid fire machine-guns.

;AS532 SC
:The AS 532SC is the naval version of the Cougar family and is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines. This version is mainly used for Anti-surface unit warfare (ASUW), fitted with AM 39 Exocet missiles; Anti-submarine warfare (ASW), fitted with a variable-depth sonar and torpedoes; Search and rescue; and Sea patrols. For deck landing, securing at high sea states, maneuver and traverse this variant can be fitted with ASIST.

;AS535
:It was variant offered to cover the Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR or &quot;RESCO&quot; in French) needs of the French Army. The military preferred to acquire the improved version of the aircraft, the Eurocopter EC725 instead to fulfill this gap.

<text>The A93 is a major road in Scotland and the highest public road in the United Kingdom. It runs north from Perth through Blairgowrie and Rattray, then through the Grampian Mountains by way of Glenshee, the Cairnwell Pass and Glen Clunie to Braemar in Aberdeenshire. At Braemar, the road then switches east down the strath of the River Dee before crossing the A90 and terminating in Aberdeen.

==Route==

Leaving Perth, the A93 continues through the planned 19th-century village of Guildtown before crossing the River Isla and passing the Meikleour Beech Hedges. north lies Blairgowrie and Rattray, the largest town in Perth and Kinross, where the road crosses the River Ericht. up Glenericht it reaches the little village of Bridge of Cally and begins the long climb up into Glenshee. At this point, it climbs from Glenshee onto the moors of Glenbeg and the snow gates at Spittal of Glenshee, which are regularly closed in winter (which here can be from October to April) to prevent motorists becoming stranded overnight. At the Cairnwell Pass, the road reaches its maximum elevation of 670 metres (2,199 ft) above sea level, which makes it, at this point, the highest public road in the United Kingdom. The southern approach to the Cairnwell Pass used to include a notorious double hairpin bend with steep gradients known as the Devil&#x27;s Elbow. This was bypassed by a new stretch of road in the early 1970s but the old hairpin bends and World War II anti-tank traps can be accessed on foot from a lay-by part way up the hill.

Over the summit of the Cairnwell Pass, the road enters Aberdeenshire and the standard of the carriageway improves considerably, wider and better surfaced than the in Perth and Kinross. Descending now, it runs along deserted Glen Clunie alongside the Clunie Water for to Braemar. So far the road has been running roughly north, but here it turns east for the descent to the North Sea at Aberdeen. from Braemar, it passes Balmoral Castle, then continues through Ballater, Dinnet, Aboyne, Kincardine O&#x27;Neil, Banchory and Peterculter before entering Aberdeen.

==Storms of 2015==
A section of the A93 near Crathie collapsed on 29–30 December 2015 due to pressure from the overflowing River Dee. The Dee had burst its banks due to the effects of Storm Frank, which caused very severe flooding across Deeside.

<text>The North End is a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is the city&#x27;s oldest residential community, having been inhabited since it was colonized in the 1630s. It is only , yet the neighborhood has nearly one hundred establishments and a variety of tourist attractions. It is known for its Italian American population and Italian restaurants.

==History==


===17th century===
The North End as a distinct community of Boston was evident as early as 1646. Three years later, the area had a large enough population to support the North Meeting House. The construction of the building also led to the development of the North Square, which was the center of community life.

Increase Mather was the minister of the North Meeting House, an influential and powerful figure who attracted residents to the North End. On November 27, 1676, Mather&#x27;s home, the meeting house, and a total of 45 buildings were destroyed by a fire—Boston organized the first paid fire department in America two years later. The meeting house was rebuilt soon afterwards, and the Paul Revere House was later constructed on the site of the Mather House. Part of Copp&#x27;s Hill was converted to a cemetery, called the North Burying Ground (now known as Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground); the earliest grave markers in the cemetery date to 1661.

===18th century===
The North End became a fashionable place to live in the 18th century. Wealthy families shared the neighborhood with artisans, journeymen, and laborers. Two brick townhouses are still standing from this period: the Pierce-Hichborn House and the Ebenezer Clough House on Unity Street. The Old North Church was constructed during this time as well, now known as Christ Church. It is the oldest surviving church building in Boston.

The Hutchinson Mansion in North Square was attacked by anti-Stamp Act rioters on the evening of August 26, 1765, forcing Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson to flee through his garden. In 1770, 11 year-old Christopher Seider was part of an angry crowd that attacked the home of Ebenezer Richardson which was located on Hanover Street. Richardson fired a gun into the crowd, hitting and fatally wounding the boy.

During the Siege of Boston, the North Meeting House was dismantled by the British for use as firewood.

===19th century===
In the first half of the 19th century, the North End experienced a significant amount of commercial development. This activity was concentrated on Commercial, Fulton, and Lewis Streets. During this time the neighborhood also developed a red-light district, known as the Black Sea. By the late 1840s, living conditions in the crowded North End were among the worst in the city. Successive waves of immigrants came to Boston and settled in the neighborhood, beginning with the Irish and continuing with Eastern European Jews and Italians. Boston as a whole was prosperous, however, and the wealthy residents of the North End moved to newer, more fashionable neighborhoods such as Beacon Hill.

In 1849, a cholera epidemic swept through Boston, hitting the North End most harshly; most of the seven hundred victims were North Enders. In 1859, tensions between the Catholic Irish immigrants and the existing Protestant community led to the Eliot School Rebellion. By 1880, the Protestant churches had left the neighborhood.

The Boston Draft Riot of July 14, 1863, began on Prince Street in the North End.

In the latter half of the 19th century, several charitable groups were formed in the North End to provide aid to its impoverished residents. These groups included The Home for Little Wanderers and the North End Mission. The North Bennet Street Industrial School (now known as North Bennet Street School) was also founded at around this time to provide North End residents with the opportunity to gain skills that would help them find employment. Beginning in the 1880s, North End residents began to replace the dilapidated wooden housing with four- and five-story brick apartment buildings, most of which still stand today. The city contributed to the revitalization of the neighborhood by constructing the North End Park and Beach, Copp&#x27;s Hill Terrace, and the North End Playground.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, the North End was dominated by Jewish and Italian immigrants. Three Italian immigrants founded the Prince Macaroni Company, one example of the successful businesses created in this community. Also during this time, the city of Boston upgraded many public facilities in the neighborhood: the Christopher Columbus School (now a condominium building), a public bathhouse, and a branch of the Boston Public Library were built. These investments, as well as the creation of the Paul Revere Mall (also known as the Prado), contributed to the North End&#x27;s modernization. The Civic Service House&#x27;s Night School, established in 1901, set out to do specialized settlement work along civic lines, and purposed to reach a constituency approaching or within the privileges of citizenship.

In 1918, the Spanish Influenza Pandemic hit the crowded North End severely; so many children were orphaned as a result of the pandemic that the city created the Home for Italian Children to care for them. The following year, in 1919, the Purity Distilling Company&#x27;s 2.3 million gallon molasses storage tank explosively burst open, causing the Great Molasses Flood. A 25 ft wave of molasses flowed down Commercial Street towards the waterfront, sweeping away everything in its path. The wave killed 21 people, injured 150, and caused damage worth $100 million in today&#x27;s money.

In 1927, the Sacco and Vanzetti wake was held in undertaker Joseph A. Langone, Jr.&#x27;s Hanover Street premises. The funeral procession that conveyed Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s bodies to the Forest Hills Cemetery began in the North End.

In 1934, the Sumner Tunnel was constructed to connect the North End to Italian East Boston, the location of the then-new Boston Airport (now Logan International Airport). In the 1950s the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway (locally known as the Central Artery) was built to relieve Boston&#x27;s traffic congestion. Hundreds of North End buildings were demolished below Cross Street, and the Artery walled off the North End from downtown, isolating the neighborhood. The increased traffic led to the construction of a second tunnel between the North End and East Boston; this second tunnel (the Callahan Tunnel) opened in 1961. Although the construction of the Central Artery created years&#x27; worth of disorder, in the 1950s the North End had low disease rates, low mortality rates, and little street crime. As described by Jane Jacobs in &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;, in 1959 the North End&#x27;s &quot;streets were alive with children playing, people shopping, people strolling, people talking. Had it not been a cold January day, there would surely have been people sitting. The general street atmosphere of buoyancy, friendliness, and good health was so infectious that I began asking directions of people just for the fun of getting in on some talk.&quot;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the North End experienced population loss. During this time, many shops in the neighborhood closed, the St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School and the St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church closed, and the waterfront industries either relocated or went defunct. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved high-rise, high-density housing projects in the neighborhood while North End residents worked to build affordable housing for the elderly. One of these projects, the Casa Maria Apartments, stands on the site of the St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church.

In 1976, the neighborhood welcomed President Ford and Queen Elizabeth II, who each visited the North End as part of the United States Bicentennial Celebrations.

During the late 20th century through the early 21st century, the Central Artery was dismantled and replaced by the Big Dig project. Throughout the construction process, access to the North End was difficult for both residents and visitors; as a result, many North End businesses closed. The Rose Kennedy Greenway is now located on the former site of the Central Artery.

== Geography ==

The North End describes its location in the historic Shawmut Peninsula, which centuries of infill have obscured. Copp&#x27;s Hill is the largest geographic feature and is close to the center of the neighborhood.

The North End&#x27;s modern boundaries are to the northeast of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, with the outlet of the Charles and Mystic Rivers to the North, and Boston Harbor to the East. Government Center, Quincy Market, and the Bulfinch Triangle neighborhoods lie across Greenway. The Charlestown Bridge crosses the mouth of the Charles River to connect the North End to Charlestown, while the Callahan Tunnel, Sumner Tunnel, and MBTA Blue Line tunnel connect it to East Boston.

Commercial Street and Atlantic Avenue border the neighborhood on the harbor side, while Hanover Street bisects the neighborhood and is the main north–south street. Cross Street and North Washington Street runs along the community&#x27;s western edge. The North End Parks of the Greenway occupy the site of the former elevated Central Artery (demolished in 2003). Other notable green spaces include Cutillo Park, Polcari Park, Langone Park, DeFilippo Playground, the Paul Revere Mall (The Prado), and the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park.

No MBTA subway station is within the neighborhood, but stations serving the Blue, Orange, and Green Lines are within 5-10 minute walks, including Aquarium, Haymarket, and North Station.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 Census data, the neighborhood&#x27;s population is 10,131, a 5.13% rise from 2000. The majority of the North End&#x27;s residents are White (90.88%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (3.69%), Asian (2.83%), Black/African Americans (1.13%), two or more races/ethnicities (1.01%) other race/ethnicity (0.29%), American Indian and Alaska Native (0.15%), and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (0.03%).

===African American community===
A small community of free African Americans lived at the base of Copp&#x27;s Hill from the 17th to the 19th century. Members of this community were buried in the Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground, where a few remaining headstones can still be seen today. The community was served by the First Baptist Church.

By the late 19th century, the African American community of the North End was known as New Guinea. By that time, however, much of the community had actually moved to Beacon Hill.

===Irish community===
Between 1845 and 1853, a massive wave of Irish immigrants settled in the North End; the neighborhood became predominantly Irish (the city&#x27;s overall population was also affected, going from a predominantly Yankee-Protestant city to being one-third Irish in just a few years). Between 1865 and 1880, the North End was almost exclusively Irish (or Irish-American) and Catholic.

===Jewish community===
In the late 19th century, a stable Jewish community began to develop in the North End. Much of the community settled along Salem Street. The community founded places of worship, a Hebrew School, and social programs. In 1903, the first and only new synagogue to be built in the North End was constructed. Carroll Place was renamed &quot;Jerusalem Place&quot; in honor of the new building. By 1922, however, the majority of Jewish residents had moved out of the North End, preferring other neighborhoods such as Roxbury.

===Italian community===

By 1890, the North Square area was known as Little Italy. The population of Italian immigrants in the North End grew steadily until reaching its peak, in 1930, of 44,000 (99.9% of the neighborhood&#x27;s total population). Although many businesses, social clubs, and religious institutions celebrate the neighborhood&#x27;s Italian heritage, the North End is now increasingly diverse. Both the population of the North End and the percent of that population who are Italian have decreased over the years; as of 2014 the population of the North End was 7,360, of whom 824 (11%) had been born in Italy and an additional 2,772 (38%) were of Italian heritage.

In 1923, the Michael Angelo (later renamed &quot;Michelangelo&quot;) School was built in the North End and named in honor of the Italian residents. The street on which the building was constructed was renamed Michelangelo Street, and remains the only street in the North End with an Italian name. The Michelangelo School closed in 1989, and the building was converted into housing.

Italian bakeries, restaurants, small shops, and groceries opened in the first half of the 20th century. The first immigrants found work selling fruit, vegetables, wine, cheese and olive oil. Later immigrants found more opportunities in the construction trades, and by 1920 the neighborhood was served by Italian physicians, dentists, funeral homes, and barbers. Residents founded businesses, some of which still exist today, including Prince Pasta, the Pastene Corporation, and Pizzeria Regina.

The Italian American community faced anti-Italian sentiment, prejudice, and neglect. After World War II, however, Italian Americans began to gain political power which then helped the community to address these issues. Today, the &quot;old world&quot; Italian atmosphere of the North End helps to drive tourism, and many of the small neighborhood shops have been replaced by restaurants. Italian feasts, such as the Feast of St. Anthony and the Fisherman&#x27;s Feast, are still celebrated in the streets of the North End, and draw large crowds.

==Arts and culture==

===Arts===
The North End Music and Performing Arts Center (NEMPAC) and the Improv Asylum Theater are located on Hanover Street. All Saints Way, a private art project located on Battery Street, is occasionally open to the public. It consists of framed portraits of Roman Catholic saints hung on a brick wall, some of which are visible from the street.

===Cuisine===
At the end of the 19th century the North End was filled with small restaurants that served inexpensive meals. In 1909, there were 12 active Italian restaurants, and by the 1930s a few of these restaurants were renowned. Today, the North End&#x27;s streets are lined with cafes, small grocery stores, and Italian restaurants. These restaurants are a popular destination for both locals and tourists.

Sicilian immigrants also started food companies specializing in their native cuisine, which after successful expansion moved out of the neighborhood. The Pastene company began as a family pushcart in the North End in 1848. Beginning in 1912, Prince pasta was manufactured in the North End and sold at 92 Prince Street. (The brand is now owned by New World Pasta.)

===Private education===
St. Johns School is a private Roman Catholic school that is located in North Square. It opened in 1873 and has served the neighborhood continuously since then.

The North End is also home to the North Bennet Street School, a trade and craftmanship school that was founded in 1885.

===Public art===
The North End is home to six of Boston&#x27;s publicly accessible artworks. The Boston Art Commission has care and custody of all public art located on city property.
*North End Library Mosaics (2009) - located at 25 Parmenter Street.
*Paul Revere sculpture (1940) - located at the Paul Revere Mall, between Hanover Street and Salem Street.
*Merchant Marine Memorial - located near the Andrew P. Puopolo Junior Athletic Field, on Commercial Street.
*Benjamin Franklin Tablet (1946) - located on the corner of Union Street and Hanover Street.
*Christopher Columbus sculpture (1979) - located in the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, near Atlantic Avenue.
*Massachusetts Beirut Memorial (1992) - located in the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park.

===Summer festivals===
Every summer, the remaining Italian residents of the North End hold festivals (feasts) to honor the patron saints of different regions in Italy from where their families immigrated. Statues of these saints are paraded down the streets of the neighborhood while well-wishers attach dollar bills to the statues as a donation and show of support. The feasts also include marching bands, food and other vendors, and live music.

===Architecture===
The North End has a mixture of architecture from all periods of American history, including early structures such as the Old North Church (1723), the Paul Revere House (1680), the Pierce-Hichborn House (1711), and the Clough House (1712). However, the bulk of the architecture seen in the area today dates from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, when tenement architecture replaced mansions and other buildings to accommodate the influx of immigrants. By the time of the Great Depression, the North End&#x27;s reputation as a city slum resulted in lending discrimination; the area&#x27;s residents could not obtain mortgages for construction or rehabilitation. Instead, residents, many of whom were carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and masons, lent their labor to each other and succeeded at rehabilitating the North End&#x27;s buildings at low cost.

Starting in the mid-1970s, the abandoned industrial area along the North End&#x27;s waterfront was rebuilt and converted into a luxury housing and business district. After the 1970s and continuing to present day, developers converted tenements into larger apartments and condominiums. New development is regulated in this historic district under city zoning regulations.

===Historic sites===
North End has twelve sites on the National Register of Historic Places.

Other notable sites include:

*Clough House
*Copp&#x27;s Hill
*Equestrian statue of Paul Revere
*Freedom Trail
*Hanover Street
*Langone Park
*North End Parks
*North Street
*North Square
*Skinny House
==Government services==
===Police===
The North End is located within the Boston Police Department&#x27;s A-1 district (Downtown, Beacon Hill, and Chinatown are also included in this district).

Residents complain of repeated noise and litter problems stemming from loud partying in the neighborhood. In 2012, Boston police officers increased patrols in the North End to deal with noise complaints. Other areas of concern have included attacks on women and a series of breaking and enterings to residential apartments. Members of the Patriarca crime family have historically lived in or operated out of the North End, including Gennaro Angiulo, Gaspare Messina, and the Dinunzio brothers (Anthony &amp; Carmen).

===Fire===
The North End is served by the Boston Fire Department. The area has been impacted by a number of significant fires—the Boston Fire Historical Society notes the following five-alarm fires in the North End since 1860:
* December 10, 1905 – Consolidated Gas Company coal sheds on Commercial Street opposite Charter Street
* February 20, 1913 – Braman, Dow &amp; Company at 239 Causeway Street
* November 2, 1952 – Union Wharf off Commercial Street
* March 7, 1962 – Commercial Wharf
* July 20, 1978 – Apartment building at 179–181 Salem Street
* February 22, 2007 – Five-story commercial and residential building at 129 Endicott Street

Two fires are known to have resulted in at least 10 fatalities, both involving crowded housing conditions:
* February 2, 1890 – tenement at 259 North Street (12 deaths)
* January 29, 1902 – lodging house at 12 Fleet Street (10 deaths)

===Public education===
The Boston Public School system operates the John Eliot Elementary School in the North End. The school opened as the North Writing School in 1713 and merged with the North Latin School in 1790 to form the John Eliot School; it is Boston&#x27;s oldest continuously run school. In 2007, the Eliot school was considered for closure due to poor performance. Between 2007 and 2011, school administrators instituted a successful improvement program, and, by 2012 the Eliot school was classified as an innovation school which was recognized for excellence by Governor Deval Patrick.

===Public library===
The Boston Public Library operates the North End Branch Library, located at 25 Parmenter Street. The branch was established in 1913 and moved to its present location, a building designed by Carl Koch, in 1963. This branch maintains an Italian-language collection as well as a local history collection in addition to its regular holdings.

===Public transportation===
The North End is accessible via mass transit provided by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) including:
* MBTA subway: Orange Line and Green Line at Haymarket and North Station, and the Blue Line at Aquarium Station
* MBTA Commuter Rail: four lines at North Station
* MBTA bus: the 4, 89/93, 92, 93, 111, 117, 191, 192, 193, 325, 326, 352, 354, 424, 426, 426/455, and 428 bus lines. The number 4 bus uses Commercial Street for part of its route that connects North Station with South Station
* MBTA boat: ferries depart from Long Wharf, connecting the North End by water to Hull, Hingham, Charlestown, Salem (seasonally), Provincetown (seasonally), and Logan Airport

==Infrastructure==

The North End has narrow, dense streets. No major streets run through the neighborhood, and virtually all trips made within the neighborhood are by walking. Still, many sidewalks are not ADA accessible because they are narrow or obstructed. Resolving this accessibility issue would require removing some on-street parking spaces.

Free and unlimited resident parking passes mean that 4,000 permits are available for only 1,500 on-street resident parking spaces. The few visitor parking spaces do not have meters, but do have two-hour limits. Paid public parking is available within the neighborhood at Lewis Wharf, Sargents Wharf, and the Cooper Street lot. Nearby public parking garages include Government Center, Dock Square, and the Boston Harbor Garage. At night, many restaurants offer valet parking.

Busy roads ring the North End. Commercial Street has two lanes of northbound and one lane of southbound traffic; and goes around the North End&#x27;s eastern perimeter. Private shuttles linking North Station to the Seaport neighborhood also use this road. On the Western edge is North Washington Street, which has the highest traffic volume in the immediate area.

Seasonal private ferries serving the Boston Harbor Islands operate from Long Wharf. Boston Water Taxis provides seasonal, on-demand water taxi service from five North End docks: Long Wharf, Yacht Haven Marina, Sargents Wharf, Burroughs Wharf, and Battery Wharf.

In 2017, the City unveiled a two-way protected cycle track on the east side of Commercial Street. Three BLUEBikes (formerly Hubway) bikeshare stations are on the edges of neighborhood: at Commercial and Fleet Streets, Hanover and Cross Streets, and Atlantic Avenue and Long Wharf.

<text>The A87 is a major road in the Highland region of Scotland.

It runs west from its junction with the A82 road at Invergarry (), along the north shores of Loch Garry and Loch Cluanie, then down through Glen Shiel and along Loch Duich to Kyle of Lochalsh before crossing the Skye Bridge to Kyleakin, Broadford, and Portree, before terminating at Uig in the north of the Isle of Skye.

Its total length is ; it is a primary route for all of its length.

==Historic route==

The route of the A87 has changed significantly over the years. Until the 1960s, the road ran along Glen Garry as far as Tomdoun, before heading north over the hills to Glen Loyne, where it crossed Loch Loyne with two bridges. It then headed north west to the Cluanie Inn, where it joined the A887. Loch Loyne was dammed as part of a hydro-electric scheme, which put part of this road underwater. A new road was built further to the east, around Loch Loyne, joining with the A887 at Bun Loyne. The remains of the bridges on Loch Loyne are visible when the level of water in the loch is low.

The A87 route used to involve a short ferry crossing over Loch Long at Dornie, but this has since been replaced with a bridge. Nearby, the A87 used to run through the village of Morvich, around an inlet at the end Loch Duich. This has now been bypassed with a causeway and bridge.

In 1995 the Skye Bridge replaced the ferry between Kyle of Localsh on the mainland and Kyleakin on the Isle of Skye. Tolls were met with considerable opposition, until removed in December 2004.

<text>The A85 is a major road in Scotland. It runs east from Oban along the south bank of Loch Etive, through Lochawe and Tyndrum, Crianlarich, Lochearnhead, St Fillans and Crieff before passing through Perth, where it crosses the River Tay via Perth Bridge (West Bridge Street) to Bridgend. Its name between Crieff and Perth is the Crieff Road. It then runs concurrently with the A90 to the Swallow Roundabout, before diverging to follow the Invergowrie Bypass, Riverside Avenue and Riverside Drive before terminating in Dundee city centre.

The A90 road from Perth to Dundee was previously numbered A85; on opening of an upgraded A94 to Aberdeen the A90 number was continued across the Friarton Bridge (previously M85) and on to the A85 route, then from Swallow Roundabout to Aberdeen. The Perth-Dundee stretch was formerly part of the Euroroute system, of route E120 which ran in a circular route between Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth.

Between Tyndrum and Crianlarich the road runs concurrently with the A82, where it merges with the main north–south road. Parts follow an old military road. In Oban, it connects with the A816 road.

Some statistics seem to show that the stretch of the A85 between Oban and Tyndrum is among the ten most dangerous roads in Scotland.

<text>The A71 is a major road in Scotland linking Edinburgh with Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. It adjoins the Livingston Bypass A899.

It runs south west from Edinburgh for approximately 70 miles, through Saughton, Wilkieston and south of Livingston, Whitburn and Wishaw, then by way of Overtown, Garrion Bridge, Stonehouse, Strathaven, Darvel, Newmilns, Galston, Hurlford and Kilmarnock to Irvine on the North Ayrshire coast.

Formerly a trunk route from the east to the west coast of Scotland it has since been downgraded to a mix of primary and secondary routes. From Edinburgh to Darvel, it is now a secondary route, in a poor state of repair in some places. But, from Darvel to Irvine, it has retained its primary route status.

==Route==
===Edinburgh to Newmains===

The A71 almost parallels the M8 between the A720 (Edinburgh City Bypass) and the junction with the A73 at Newmains. It passes through the village of Wilkieston and onto the Mid Calder bypass, which leads the route to the south of Livingston. The A71 follows a very straight course through Livingston with several grade separated junctions.

===Newmains to Darvel=== 

West of Livingston, the A71 turns sharply south west, bypassing Shotts, Newmains and Wishaw then descends steeply into the Clyde Valley, over Garrion Bridge at the junction with the A72. The A71 climbs steeply up the western side of the Clyde valley on a road which it shares for a very short section with the A72.

When the A71 peaks at the top of the valley, it goes under the M74 at Jct 8 (a junction known locally as Canderside Toll), before turning towards the village of Stonehouse, where a bypass takes traffic to the north of the narrow village roads, before descending into the Avon valley and into Strathaven. This village, at a meeting of the A71, A723 and A726, provides a link to East Kilbride and Paisley, as well as to Lanark, Hamilton and Motherwell.

===Darvel to Irvine===

The A71 then becomes a narrow and winding road across moorland, as the road ascends to the head of the Avon valley. At the highest point is Loudoun Hill, an ancient site of human occupation, and the road here follows the route of a minor Roman road which once linked the Clyde Valley and the coast. The road descends into the Irvine Valley, going through the towns of Darvel and Newmilns, and bypassing Galston and then through Hurlford. At Darvel, the A71 becomes a primary route for the rest of its length to Irvine, and widens slightly, with a straighter alignment until its junction with the A77, south of Kilmarnock. The A71 remains as a dual-carriageway until its terminus in Irvine town centre. A crash barrier runs along the central reservation of the dual-carriageway from the A77 to the boundary with North Ayrshire at Dreghorn.

In mid 2014, the road began to subside between Darvel and Newmilns, with the westbound lane being affected near to the entrance to Gowanbank House. Traffic lights were put in place while a solution was sought, however as of January 2017, a solution has been found and the traffic lights have been lifted.

<doc id="531179" wikidata="Q4992739" url="?curid=531179" title="History of Scania">
<text>For hundreds of years up until the 18th century, the history of the province of Scania was marked by the struggle between the two Scandinavian kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden over the hegemony in the Baltic area.

== Viking age ==
It was previously thought that society in Scania, like in the rest of Scandinavia, was made up of farmers mostly Fen farmers and cattle farmers, thralls, the farmer being free and equal, and having their say at the Things in the affairs of society. Archeological findings on Jutland, the Danish islands, and on the Scanian plains have modified this picture. It has now become clear that the distribution of wealth, at least from the early Migration Period, was very uneven. The plains were to a large extent divided up between large farms which were far bigger than smallholdings, and were often grouped in villages. Subsequently, only a small faction of the population can be presumed to have enjoyed full civic rights. It seems now more likely that this society ought to be perceived as a system of tribes, each led by chieftains, in Danish often called &quot;godes&quot;, whose authority depended on the size and wealth of the tribe. Scania had 5 main tribes each having had their own Thanes (leaders), and their own group of warriors, all under the command of the King of Scania.

==After Christianization==

It now seems likely that a period of domestic colonization within Scania that was earlier believed to have started before the Viking Age, in reality largely took place after the Viking Age, when donations of land to monasteries led to influences from Continental Europe. This led to a transition from a predominantly animal husbandry-based society to one of farming, which entailed extensive land clearing, possibly also connected with the liberation of the thralls, that led to the creation of many new settlements with names ending in &quot;-torp, -rup,&quot; and &quot;-rød.&quot;
Scania was first mentioned in written texts in the 8th century, stating that it was a part of Denmark. According to the Large Jelling Stone, Scanians, like all Danes were Christianized by &quot;the King of all Danes&quot;, Harald Bluetooth before this stone was raised, presumably around 985 AD.

The Scanian law, the oldest of the Medieval Scandinavian laws, came into force in the beginning of the 13th century. It is remarkable in the sense that it exists written in both &quot;Latin letters&quot; (not in Latin though) as well as Runes, &quot;Codex runicus&quot;.
Already in 1060 was Dalby Church build by Svend Estridsen, as one of the first Danish churches made of stone. Between 1104 and 1536, Lund was the Archbishopric of Denmark, and the Danish National Banner, Dannebrog, was preserved in the Cathedral for several centuries.

In 1332 the king of Denmark, Christopher II, died as a &quot;king without a country&quot; after he and his older brother and predecessor had divided Denmark into much smaller polities. King Magnus IV of Sweden took advantage of his neighbour&#x27;s distress, redeeming the eastern Danish provinces for a huge amount of silver, which included Scania. The province was later reconquered by the Danish king Valdemar IV of Denmark in 1360, as part of his conquest campaign to regain previously lost Danish territory.
During parts of the Middle Ages, Scania was known throughout Northern Europe for its herring and the market where it was sold.

==14th and 15th centuries==
In the middle of the 14th century the Black Death affected the area as much as in most of Europe. Generally the population declined with a third or more.
By the end of this century, the Kalmar Union rose as an attempt to counter the Hanseatic League. The Union was largely a creation of Queen Margaret who had become Queen in Denmark and Norway in 1387, as her only son, King Olaf II of Denmark and IV of Norway died. And two years later she helped the Swedes to get rid of the disliked Albert of Mecklenburg. Her adopted son Boguslaw, actual son of a Polish-Pomeranian Duke, was given the name Eric of Pomerania, as he was crowned King of all three Scandinavian countries on 17 June 1397 in Kalmar, hence the name of the Union. Queen Margaret, remained as the de facto ruler of the three kingdoms more or less until her death in 1412. King Eric founded the Scanian Town, which today is known as Landskrona at the central part of the all Danish Øresund, and introduced the Sound Dues (Øresundtolden) in 1429, which was to last until 1857 (with exception of Swedish ships between 1658 and 1720). By this he secured a large stable income for his kingdom that made it relatively rich and which made the town of Elsinore (Helsingør) flowering.
In the Franciscan monastery at Lund, &quot;the Academy&quot; was established in 1425. It was a kind of medieval university, but was closed when the Reformation reached Denmark in 1536.

==Renaissance and final Danish rule==

=== Golden age of the aristocracy ===
The period between 1536 and 1660 is often considered a golden age of the Scania nobility in terms of their wealth and economic control. Church estates were confiscated by the Crown in 1536 (following the example of the Swedish Crown in 1527 provided by Gustav Vasa). These included prosperous lands belonging to the former archbishopric at Hogestad and Snårestad as well as those of the monasteries at Bosjökloster, Dalbykloster and Övedskloster. However, the land swap policy of Fredrik II whereby he exchanged lands in Scania for lands near his own estate in Själland (Zealand) resulted in large areas within Scania falling into the hands of local nobility. Their wealth is visible in the private castle-building of the period in places such as Rosendal Castle. By the 17th century approximately 54% overall of the 15,000 estates in Scania were owned by the nobility, though the concentration of ownership was not evenly spread. In the area of Ystad, around 80% of the farmland was owned by aristocrats by 1650.

=== Regional tensions ===
Scania&#x27;s geopolitical position, situated on the Scandinavian mainland but politically part of the Danish kingdom, made it for centuries the of the struggle for hegemony in the Baltic region between Denmark and Sweden, the so-called &quot;dominium maris baltici&quot;. The two Nordic countries were in conflict with each other for about five hundred years. By possessing both sides of the Öresund strait, as well as The Belts, Denmark had effective control over the entrance to the Baltic Sea and was able to monopolize trade through the sounds. From the 15th century, Denmark started to collect the Sound Dues, a transitory due from all foreign ships passing through the strait, whether &quot;en route&quot; to or from Denmark or not. The Sound Dues constituted the major source of income for the Danish crown and was resented by the Swedish Crown.
In the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645), Sweden&#x27;s representatives stipulated toll freedom in Öresund for the country, and after this point, Sweden was exempted from paying the Danish Sound Toll. However, this arrangement came to an end in 1720, when the Treaty of Frederiksborg officially ended Sweden&#x27;s toll-free status. Denmark continued to collect Sound Toll until 1857.

In the winter of 1612, over a period of two weeks, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf burned down or otherwise destroyed 24 Scanian parishes and most of their population without meeting any enemy troops. The largest destroyed settlement was the Town Væ, which two years later was replaced by Danish King Christian IV as the nearby Christiansted (after the Swedification process, spelled Kristianstad), the last Scanian town to be founded by a Danish king.

== 1658 conquest by Sweden ==

Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, Scania together with all Danish lands east of Öresund became a possession of Sweden. This treaty followed the Dano-Swedish War (1657-1658), which was a part of a wider war, which also included Poland and some of the German states of that time. 

Soon after the signing of the Instrument of Cession king Charles X Gustav of Sweden landed in Helsingborg on 5 March 1658 (O.S.) to take possession of the newly acquired provinces. The king was received by a delegation led by the bishop of the Diocese of Lund, Peder Winstrup. The Copenhagen-born bishop quickly shifted his allegiance to the new ruler and later became ennobled. He stayed in office until his death in 1679.

After the Roskilde treaty war with Denmark soon broke out again, this time started by Charles X Gustav of Sweden. The result of this war and the following Treaty of Copenhagen (1660) was the return of Bornholm to Denmark and the present border between the countries was established. At that time king Charles Gustav had died of an infection, during a visit to Gothenburg.

Scania, together with the other so-called Scanian provinces, was placed under a Governor-General taking up residence in the city of Malmö. The first Governor-General was Gustaf Otto Stenbock. This type of government was used in territories which were not fully integrated and were regarded as being more exposed to enemy attacks. The Governor-General held the highest military command in his area and had four county governors answering to him. In 1669 the general governorate was dismantled, but after the outbreak of the Scanian War in 1676 it was reinstituted.

In 1666 the University of Lund or &quot;Regia Academia Carolina&quot;, after a proposal from Bishop Peder Winstrup, was established as part of a programme of measures to further integrate the newly acquired provinces. The university was closed during the Scanian War, but reopened in 1682.

In 1676, during the Scanian War, the province was occupied by Denmark and many Scanians either joined the Danish army or fought with the Danish. The members of this partisan movement were known as &quot;friskydter&quot;, but are today most known by the Swedish degrading name Snapphanar. The 1676–1679 war between Denmark and Sweden over Scania was devastating for the people of Scania. It effectively ended in a draw, after much destruction of property and suffering for the civilian population. Landskrona Citadel became used as the primary Danish base and recruitment centre Turning points came with the Swedish victories in the Battle of Lund in December 1676 and the Battle of Landskrona in July 1677. But the war continued another two years.

In the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1679) on 2.September (Gregorian calendar) peace was restored through French intervention. The Treaty of Copenhagen (1660) borders would be restored in exchange for indemnities, and yet again would Scania become subordinated to Sweden against the will of its people. and the treaty was again confirmed as Treaty of Lund exactly a fortnight later, on the 16th.

 Section 9 of the Roskilde peace treaty had initially ensured autonomy in Scania and in an additional agreement, signed at the Malmö Recess in 1662, Sweden guaranteed that the old laws and privileges of Scania would continue to apply in the region. The Malmö Recess agreement further ensured that Scanian noblemen, priests and peasants would be allowed to send representatives to the Swedish parliament.

However, in 1680 Sweden&#x27;s first era of absolute monarchy was ushered in as the Swedish king Charles XI managed to convince the Diet, (the Riksdag of the Estates, an early form of Swedish Parliament) to declare the king &quot;a Christian ruler with absolute power to rule his kingdom at his discretion&quot;. In 1682, the Diet downgraded the Council of State to a King&#x27;s Council and gave the king unlimited powers to legislate without the need for confirmation from the Diet. A decision not to honour the agreement of the Malmö Recess soon followed and a tougher Swedification program was implemented in Scania, aiming to create uniformity within the Swedish kingdom. Scania was allowed to retain its old laws and customs until 1683, at which point the Swedish administration persuaded the Scanian aristocracy to waive the Scanian laws and privileges in favour of the new Swedish law and church ordinance, as a condition for allowing Scanians to have representation in the Swedish parliament.

An entire staff of Swedish politicians, artists, poets and scholars were engaged in creating an image of the king as an instrument of God and a personification of the apocalyptic &quot;Lion of the North&quot;, a form of symbolic imagery first introduced for Gustav II Adolf. The propaganda was not only aimed at convincing the Swedish population of the king&#x27;s divinely ordained power, but was also part of a campaign to present Sweden to the world as an imperial power of considerable wealth and military glory. Many works of art from the era show Charles XI as a victorious warrior in Scania and on the central panel of Jacques Foucquet&#x27;s monumental ceiling painting in the Stockholm Royal Palace, Charles XI is depicted with &quot;the goddess of Scania&quot; at his feet.
Blekinge and especially Halland were successively removed from the Skåneland dominion and became fully integrated into the Swedish Kingdom, while the four counties of Scania were joined into one county. Blekinge was though allowed to remain within the diocese of Lund and still is. A gradual process of incorporation of Scania into the Swedish Kingdom was successfully concluded by 1720.

The latest battle between Denmark and Sweden concerning the control of Scania was the Battle of Helsingborg (1710) during the Great Northern War. In March that year the last Danish troops left the province. In July 1720, a peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark again confirmed the status of Scania as part of Sweden.

Two counties got governors and an administrative pattern identical to the other Swedish counties. However, the hostilities between Denmark and Sweden during the Napoleonic Wars caused Sweden to reintroduce the office of the Governor-General. Between 1801 and 1809, Johan Christopher Toll was appointed Governor-General of Scania, with the county governors of Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County answering to him.

King Charles XII took up residence in the city of Lund for two years after his return to Sweden from the Ottoman Empire in 1716.

==After peace treaty of 1720==

In July 1720, a peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark again confirmed the status of Scania as part of Sweden.

A land reform, the so-called &quot;Enskifte&quot; was implemented at the turn of century 1700/1800. At that time the population of the province had just passed 250,000 inhabitants. Rutger Macklean was the first to enforce this largely good reform in the 1780s, at his feudal domains around Svaneholm Castle. But he also burned down the farmer&#x27;s villages which later caused some unnecessary troubles when the reform was enforced generally.

Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, the future king Charles XIV John, landed in Helsingborg on the 20 of October 1810 on his way from Paris to Stockholm.

In 1811 revolts broke out in different parts of Sweden due to extra conscriptions of farmers. At the Klågerup shootings 30–40 civilians got shot to death by the military. Several hundred were taken prisoners or/and were wounded. In the aftermath two men publicly first got their right hand cut off and then were beheaded at Stortorget square in Malmö. Also many others were physically punished.

The first horse-drawn railway (although with wooden rails) on Swedish soil was opened in 1798 at Höganäs, connecting the coal mine with the harbour. In 1856 one of the first public railways in the country opened between Malmö and Lund.

In 1863 the population of Scania had reached 500,000 inhabitants.

In the 19th century Scania became the cradle of the Swedish Social Democratic Party when August Palm held his speech &quot;Hvad vilja socialisterna?&quot; (&quot;What do the Socialists want?&quot;) in Malmö in 1881, where he also started the newspaper &quot;Folkviljan&quot;.

Train ferries began to sail the HH route between Helsingborg and Elsinore in 1892 and from 1909 on the route Trelleborg – Sassnitz, Germany. The train ferries later began to transport cars and lorries as well.
At 18. and 19. December 1914, the &quot;Three Kings Meeting&quot; was held in Malmö. In order to confirm the joint Scandinavian neutrality during the then ongoing World War, the Swedish King Gustav V, the Danish King Christian X and (his brother) the Norwegian King Håkon VII met together with their Ministers of Foreign Affairs, at Malmö. The Three King&#x27;s meeting also meant the full Swedish acceptance of Norway&#x27;s secession from the former Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905. The Swedish King as of 1905, Oscar II couldn&#x27;t accept his loss of Norway. But in 1907 had his son Gustav V become King, and at least by 1914 could the new Swedish Regent see the call for a normalisation also between the Swedish and the new Norwegian &quot;courts&quot;. Ever since this Royal meeting in Malmö, has the Royal relationships between Sweden, Denmark and Norway indeed been excellent.

The first public flight school in Sweden was set up in 1915, at Ljungbyhed by Enoch Thulin. Between 1926 and 1996 it was the flight school of the Swedish Air Force. Today commercial flight training is performed at Ljungbyhed Airport, one of the world&#x27;s oldest active airports. In 1924 the world&#x27;s shortest international air route was opened from Malmö Bulltofta Airport to Copenhagen, Denmark, using Junkers F 13.

After the February Revolution in Russia 1917, Germany&#x27;s hope for a separate peace treaty with Russia arose. But the new Russian &quot;temporary leader&quot; Alexander Kerensky declined. Then Germany gave the Russian communist agitator Vladimir Lenin and his companions in Switzerland a safe-conduct through the German Empire, in the hope that Lenin and the communists would destabilise Russia so that hopefully peace could be achieved at the Eastern Front. In August 1917 Lenin and his entourage arrived to Scania, on this historically important journey, through the train ferry line between Saßnitz (Germany) and Trelleborg (Scania in Sweden).

Between 1930 and 1939, the Saxtorp TT-races were held. Motorcycle races resembling the ones at Isle of Man. Nine of these in all ten races, gathered attendances exceeding 100.000, up to 160.000. No other sport events in Sweden has seen crowds of this size. The 1937 race &quot;only&quot; attracted 80.000 people due to heavy rain.

The first motorway in Sweden was inaugurated in 1953 connecting Malmö and Lund (today part of European route E22).

For the 1958 FIFA World Cup was Malmö Stadion build, it was a venue for both football and track and field. The opening game of the entire championships was played there as BRD or &quot;West Germany&quot; defeated Argentina, 3–1. A few games were also played at Olympia in Helsingborg.

In the middle of the 1970s the population of the province passed the one-million mark.

The first aircraft hijacking in Sweden occurred in September 1972 at Bulltofta Airport in Malmö, involving Croatian terrorists.

Malmö and the old Malmö Stadion was one of the four stadiums which hosted the UEFA Euro 1992. Three games were played at Malmö Stadion, Denmark vs England 0-0, England vs France 0–0 and France vs Denmark 1–2.

A new administrative pattern was set up 1997 when Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County were amalgamated, forming Skåne County with 33 municipalities.

In July 2000 the Öresund Bridge was inaugurated, creating a fixed rail and road link between Sweden and Denmark.

At 6.22 am CET, on 16 December 2008 did a very unusual earthquake hit not only Scania, but was felt in large parts of Götaland, Denmark and Northern Germany and Poland. Its epicentre was located close to Sjöbo, and measured 4.8–4.9 on the Richter Scale, and was the worst earthquake in Sweden for a century or longer, according to the closest seismographic station, which is located in Berlin, Germany The craw-flight distance between Sjöbo and Berlin is less than 400 km.

Pope Francis visited the province on 31 October and 1 November 2016. His 24-hour Scanian visit commemorated the 500 year anniversary of the beginning of The Reformation. An ecumenical liturgy was held in the 900 year old Lund Cathedral and the following morning the pope conducted a Catholic mass at Malmö FF&#x27;s football stadium. During the ecumenical commemoration in the cathedral the Pope and the president of the Lutheran World Federation, Bishop Dr Munib Younan signed a treaty in which Lutherans and Catholics promised each other to in the future see more to what unites than differs between these two branches of Christianity (The Pope had earlier done the same with the Eastern Orthodox Church).

During 2015, the province&#x27;s population exceeded 1.3 million.

<text>Francesco Minerva (31 January 1904 – 23 August 2004) was an Italian Roman Catholic prelate; at his death he was the second-oldest living bishop in the Roman Catholic Church, after Corrado Bafile. He was also one of its longest-serving priests, having been ordained on 16 April 1927.

==Biography==
Minerva was born at Canosa di Puglia. He graduated in theology at the Pontifical Lateran University and, later, in law at the University of Bari.
Pope Pius XII named Minerva bishop of Nardò in 1948 and in 1950 transferred him to the somewhat larger diocese of Lecce. While his successor in Nardò, Corrado Ursi, went on to become Archbishop of Naples and a Cardinal, Minerva continued in Lecce, which was elevated to an archdiocese in 1980, and retired in 1981.

He died at Canosa di Puglia in 2004. He is buried in the Cathedral of San Sabino in that city.

<doc id="531184" wikidata="Q7667810" url="?curid=531184" title="Water cooling">
<text>Water cooling is a method of heat removal from components and industrial equipment. Evaporative cooling using water is often more efficient than air cooling. Water is inexpensive and non-toxic; however, it can contain impurities and cause corrosion.

Water cooling is commonly used for cooling automobile internal combustion engines and power stations. Water coolers utilising convective heat transfer are used inside high-end personal computers to lower the temperature of CPUs and other components.

Other uses include the cooling of lubricant oil in pumps; for cooling purposes in heat exchangers; for cooling buildings in HVAC and in chillers.

==Mechanism==
=== Advantages ===
Water is inexpensive, non-toxic, and available over most of the earth&#x27;s surface. Liquid cooling offers higher thermal conductivity than air cooling. Water has unusually high specific heat capacity among commonly available liquids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure allowing efficient heat transfer over distance with low rates of mass transfer. Cooling water may be recycled through a &quot;recirculating&quot; system or used in a single-pass &quot;once-through cooling&quot; (OTC) system. Water&#x27;s high enthalpy of vaporization allows the option of efficient evaporative cooling to remove waste heat in cooling towers or cooling ponds. Recirculating systems are &quot;open&quot; if they rely upon evaporative cooling or &quot;closed&quot; if heat removal is accomplished in heat exchangers, thus with negligible evaporative loss. A heat exchanger or condenser may separate &quot;non-contact cooling water&quot; from a fluid being cooled, or &quot;contact cooling water&quot; may directly impinge on items like saw blades where phase difference allows easy separation. Environmental regulations emphasize the reduced concentrations of waste products in non-contact cooling water.

=== Disadvantages ===
Water accelerates the corrosion of metal parts and is a favorable medium for biological growth. Dissolved minerals in natural water supplies are concentrated by evaporation to leave deposits called scale. Cooling water often requires the addition of chemicals to minimize corrosion and insulating deposits of scale and biofouling.

Water contains varying amounts of impurities from contact with the atmosphere, soil, and containers. Being both an electrical conductor and a solvent for metal ions and oxygen, water can accelerate corrosion of machinery being cooled. Corrosion reactions proceed more rapidly as temperature increases. Preservation of machinery in the presence of hot water has been improved by addition of corrosion inhibitors including zinc, chromates and phosphates. The first two have toxicity concerns; and the last has been associated with eutrophication. Residual concentrations of biocides and corrosion inhibitors are of potential concern for OTC and blowdown from open recirculating cooling water systems. With the exception of machines with short design life, closed recirculating systems require periodic cooling-water treatment or replacement raising similar concern about ultimate disposal of cooling water containing chemicals used with environmental safety assumptions of a closed system.

Biofouling occurs because water is a favorable environment for many life forms. Flow characteristics of recirculating cooling water systems encourage colonization by sessile organisms using the circulating supply of food, oxygen and nutrients. Temperatures may become high enough to support thermophilic populations of organisms such as types of fungi. Biofouling of heat exchange surfaces can reduce heat transfer rates of the cooling system, and biofouling of cooling towers can alter flow distribution to reduce evaporative cooling rates. Biofouling may also create differential oxygen concentrations increasing corrosion rates. OTC and open recirculating systems are more susceptible to biofouling. Biofouling may be inhibited by temporary habitat modifications. Temperature differences may discourage the establishment of thermophilic populations in intermittently operated facilities, and intentional short-term temperature spikes may periodically kill less tolerant populations. Biocides have been commonly used to control biofouling where sustained facility operation is required.

Chlorine may be added in the form of hypochlorite to decrease biofouling in cooling water systems, but is later reduced to chloride to minimize the toxicity of blowdown or OTC water returned to natural aquatic environments. Hypochlorite is increasingly destructive to wooden cooling towers as pH increases. Chlorinated phenols have been used as biocides or leached from preserved wood in cooling towers. Both hypochlorite and pentachlorophenol have reduced effectiveness at pH values greater than 8. Non-oxidizing biocides may be more difficult to detoxify prior to release of blowdown or OTC water to natural aquatic environments.

Concentrations of polyphosphates or phosphonates with zinc and chromates or similar compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean enough that a film of gamma iron oxide and zinc phosphate can inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points. These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and phosphorus compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water. Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition in the cooling water system, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged lower chromate concentrations and the use of less-flexible corrosion inhibitors. Blowdown may also contain chromium leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with chromated copper arsenate.

Total dissolved solids or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is reported as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of filtered water is evaporated. Salinity indicates water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials. Probability of scale formation increases with increasing total dissolved solids. Solids commonly associated with scale formation are calcium and magnesium both as carbonate and sulfate. Corrosion rates initially increase with salinity in response to increasing electrical conductivity, but then decrease after reaching a peak as higher levels of salinity decrease dissolved oxygen levels.

Some groundwater contains very little oxygen when pumped from wells, but most natural water supplies include dissolved oxygen. Increasing oxygen concentrations accelerate corrosion. Dissolved oxygen approaches saturation levels in cooling towers. It is beneficial in blowdown or OTC water being returned to natural aquatic environments.

Water ionizes into hydronium (H3O+) cations and hydroxide (OH−) anions. The concentration of ionized hydrogen (as protonated water) in a cooling water system is reported as the pH level. Low pH values increase the rate of corrosion; high pH values encourage scale formation. Amphoterism is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems, but aluminum corrosion rates increase with pH values above 9. Galvanic corrosion may be severe in water systems with copper and aluminum components. Acid can be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the pH decrease will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids.

== Steam power stations ==
Few other cooling applications approach the large volumes of water required to condense low-pressure steam at power stations. Many facilities, particularly electric power plants, use millions of gallons of water per day for cooling. Water cooling on this scale may alter natural water environments and create new environments. Thermal pollution of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters is a consideration when siting such plants. Water returned to aquatic environments at temperatures higher than the ambient receiving water modifies aquatic habitat by increasing biochemical reaction rates and decreasing the oxygen saturation capacity of the habitat. Temperature increases initially favor a population shift from species requiring the high-oxygen concentration of cold water to those enjoying the advantages of increased metabolic rates in warm water.

Once-through cooling (OTC) systems may be used on very large rivers or at coastal and estuarine sites. These power stations put the waste heat into the river or coastal water. These OTC systems thus rely upon an ample supply of river water or seawater for their cooling needs. Such facilities are built with intake structures designed for bringing in large volumes of water at a high rate of flow. These structures tend to also pull in large numbers of fish and other aquatic organisms, which are killed or injured on the intake screens. Large flow rates may trap slow-swimming organisms including fish and shrimp on screens protecting the small bore tubes of the heat exchangers from blockage. High temperatures or pump turbulence and shear may kill or disable smaller organisms that pass through the screens entrained with the cooling water. More than 1,200 power plants and manufacturing facilities in the U.S. use OTC systems; the intake structures kill billions of fish and other organisms each year. More-agile aquatic predators consume organisms impinged on the screens; and warm water predators and scavengers colonize the cooling water discharge to feed on entrained organisms.

The U.S. Clean Water Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue regulations on industrial cooling water intake structures. EPA issued final regulations for new facilities in 2001 (amended 2003), and for existing facilities in 2014.

=== Cooling towers ===
As an alternative to OTC, industrial cooling towers may use recirculated river water, coastal water (seawater), or well water. Large mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft cooling towers in industrial plants continuously circulate cooling water through heat exchangers and other equipment where the water absorbs heat. That heat is then rejected to the atmosphere by the evaporation of some of the water in cooling towers where upflowing air contacts the downflowing water. The loss of evaporated water into the air exhausted to the atmosphere is replaced by &quot;make-up&quot; fresh river water or fresh cooling water, but the amount of water lost during evaporative cooling may affect the natural habitat for aquatic organisms. Because the evaporated pure water is replaced by make-up water containing carbonates and other dissolved salts, a portion of the circulating water is continuously discarded as &quot;blowdown&quot; water to minimize the excessive build-up of salts in the circulating water; these blowdown wastes may change the receiving water quality.

== Internal combustion engines ==
The heated coolant mixture can be used to warm the air inside the car by means of the heater core. Also, the water jacket around an engine is very effective at deadening mechanical noises, making the engine quieter.

=== Open method ===
An open water cooling system makes use of evaporative cooling, lowering the temperature of the remaining (unevaporated) water. This method was common in early internal combustion engines until scale buildup was observed from dissolved salts and minerals in the water. Modern open cooling systems continuously waste a fraction of recirculating water as blowdown to remove dissolved solids at concentrations low enough to prevent scale formation. Some open systems use inexpensive tap water, but this requires higher blowdown rates than deionized or distilled water. Purified water systems still require blowdown to remove the accumulation of byproducts of chemical treatment to prevent corrosion and biofouling.

=== Pressurization ===
Water for cooling has a boiling point temperature of around 100 degrees C at atmospheric pressure. Engines operating at higher temperatures may require a pressurized recycle loop to prevent overheating. Modern automotive cooling systems often operate at to raise the boiling-point of the recycling water coolant and reduce evaporative losses.

=== Antifreeze ===
The use of water cooling carries the risk of damage from freezing. Automotive and many other engine cooling applications require the use of a water and antifreeze mixture to lower the freezing point to a temperature unlikely to be experienced. Antifreeze also inhibits corrosion from dissimilar metals and can increase the boiling point, allowing a wider range of water cooling temperatures. Its distinctive odor also alerts operators to cooling system leaks and problems that would go unnoticed in a water-only cooling system.

=== Other additives ===
Other less common chemical additives are products to reduce surface tension. These additives are meant to increase the efficiency of automotive cooling systems. Such products are used to enhance the cooling of underperforming or undersized cooling systems or in racing where the weight of a larger cooling system could be a disadvantage.

== Power electronics and transmitters ==
Since approximately 1930 it is common to use water cooling for tubes of powerful transmitters. As these devices use high operation voltages (around 10 kV), the use of deionized water is required and it has to be carefully controlled.
Modern solid-state transmitters can be built so that even high-power transmitters do not require water cooling. Water cooling is however also sometimes used for thyristors of HVDC valves, for which the use of deionized water is required.

=== Liquid cooling maintenance ===

Liquid cooling techniques are increasingly being used for the thermal management of electronic components. This type of cooling is a solution to ensure the optimisation of energy efficiency while simultaneously minimising noise and space requirements. Especially useful in supercomputers or Data Centers because maintenance of the racks is quick and easy. After disassembly of the rack, advanced-technology quick-release couplings eliminate spillage for the safety of operators and protect the integrity of fluids (no impurities in the circuits). These couplings are also capable of being locked (Panel mounted?) to allow blind connection in difficult-to-access areas. It is important in electronics technology to analyse the connection systems to ensure:
* Non-spill sealing (clean break, flush face couplings)
* Compact and lightweight (materials in special aluminum alloys)
* Operator safety (disconnection without spillage)
* Quick-release couplings sized for optimized flow
* Connection guiding system and compensation of misalignment during connection on rack systems
* Excellent resistance to vibration and corrosion
* Designed to withstand a large number of connections even on refrigerant circuits under residual pressure

== Computer usage ==

Water cooling often adds complexity and cost in comparison to air cooling design by requiring a pump, tubing or piping to transport the water, and a radiator, often with fans, to reject the heat to the atmosphere. Depending on the application, water cooling may create an additional element of risk where leakage from the water coolant recycle loop can corrode or short-circuit sensitive electronic components.

The primary advantage of water cooling for cooling CPU cores in computing equipment is transporting heat away from the source to a secondary cooling surface to allow for large, more optimally designed radiators rather than small, relatively inefficient fins mounted directly on the heat source. Cooling hot computer components with various fluids has been in use since at least the Cray-2 in 1982, which used Fluorinert. Through the 1990s, water cooling for home PCs slowly gained recognition among enthusiasts, but it became noticeably more prevalent after the introduction of the first Gigahertz-clocked processors in the early 2000s. As of 2018, there are dozens of manufacturers of water cooling components and kits, and many computer manufacturers include preinstalled water cooling solutions for their high-performance systems.

Water cooling can be used for many computer components, but usually it is used for the CPU and GPUs. Water cooling typically uses a water block, a water pump, and a water-to-air heat exchanger. By transferring device heat to a separate larger heat exchanger using larger, lower-speed fans, water cooling can allow quieter operation, improved processor speeds (overclocking), or a balance of both. Less commonly, Northbridges, Southbridges, hard disk drives, memory, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), and even power supplies can be water-cooled.

Internal radiator size may vary: from 40 mm dual fan (80 mm) to 140 quad fan (560 mm) and thickness from 30 mm to 80 mm. Radiator fans may be mounted on one or both sides. External radiators can be much larger than their internal counterparts as they do not need to fit in the confines of a computer case. High-end cases may have two rubber grommeted ports in the back for the inlet and outlet hoses, which allow external radiators to be placed far away from the PC.
A &quot;T-Line&quot; is used to remove trapped air bubbles from the circulating water. It is made with a t-connector and a capped-off length of tubing. The tube n acts as a mini-reservoir and allows air bubbles to travel into it as they are caught into the &quot;tee&quot; connector, and ultimately removed from the system by bleeding. The capped line may be capped with a fill-port fitting to allow the release of trapped gas and the addition of liquid. 

Water coolers for desktop computers were, until the end of the 1990s, homemade. They were made from car radiators (or more commonly, a car&#x27;s heater core), aquarium pumps and home-made water blocks, laboratory-grade PVC and silicone tubing and various reservoirs (homemade using plastic bottles, or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic, usually clear) and or a T-Line. More recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water-cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case. This, and the trend to CPUs of higher power dissipation, has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling.

Dedicated overclockers have occasionally used vapor-compression refrigeration or thermoelectric coolers in place of more common standard heat exchangers. Water cooling systems in which water is cooled directly by the evaporator coil of a phase change system are able to chill the circulating coolant below the ambient air temperature (impossible with a standard heat exchanger) and, as a result, generally provide superior cooling of the computer&#x27;s heat-generating components. The downside of phase-change or thermoelectric cooling is that it uses much more electricity, and antifreeze must be added due to the low temperature. Additionally, insulation, usually in the form of lagging around water pipes and neoprene pads around the components to be cooled, must be used in order to prevent damage caused by condensation of water vapour from the air on chilled surfaces. Common places from which to obtain the required phase transition systems are a household dehumidifier or air conditioner.

An alternative cooling scheme, which also enables components to be cooled below the ambient temperature while obviating the requirement for antifreeze and lagged pipes, is to place a thermoelectric device (commonly referred to as a &#x27;Peltier junction&#x27; or &#x27;pelt&#x27; after Jean Peltier, who documented the effect) between the heat-generating component and the water block. Because the only sub-ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat-generating component itself, insulation is required only in that localized area. The disadvantage of such a system is higher power dissipation.

To avoid damage from condensation around the Peltier junction, a proper installation requires it to be &quot;potted&quot; with silicone epoxy. The epoxy is applied around the edges of the device, preventing air from entering or leaving the interior.

Apple&#x27;s Power Mac G5 was the first mainstream desktop computer to have water cooling as standard (although only on its fastest models). Dell followed suit by shipping their XPS computers with liquid cooling, using thermoelectric cooling to help cool the liquid. Currently, Dell&#x27;s only computers to offer liquid cooling are their Alienware desktops.

Asus are the first and only mainstream brand to have put water-cooled laptops into mass production. Those laptops have a built-in air/water hybrid cooling system and can be docked to an external liquid cooling radiator for additional cooling and electrical power.

== Ships and boats ==
Water is an ideal cooling medium for vessels as they are constantly surrounded by water that generally remains at a low temperature throughout the year. Systems operating with seawater need to be manufactured from cupronickel, bronze, titanium or similarly corrosion-resistant materials. Water containing sediment may require velocity restrictions through piping to avoid erosion at high velocity or blockage by settling at low velocity.

Plant transpiration and animal perspiration use evaporative cooling to prevent high temperatures from causing unsustainable metabolic rates.

Machine guns used in fixed defensive positions sometimes use water cooling to extend barrel life through periods of rapid fire, but the weight of the water and pumping system significantly reduces the portability of water-cooled firearms. Water-cooled machine guns were extensively used by both sides during World War I; however, by the end of the war lighter weapons that rivaled the firepower, effectiveness and reliability of water-cooled models began to appear on the battlefield. Thus water-cooled weapons have played a far lesser role in subsequent conflicts.

A hospital in Sweden relies on snow-cooling from melt-water to cool its data centers, medical equipment, and maintain a comfortable ambient temperature.

Some nuclear reactors use heavy water as coolant. Heavy water is employed in nuclear reactors because it is a weaker neutron absorber. This allows for the use of less-enriched fuel. For the main cooling system, normal water is preferably employed through the use of a heat exchanger, as heavy water is much more expensive. Reactors that use other materials for moderation (graphite) may also use normal water for cooling.

High-grade industrial water (produced by reverse osmosis or distillation) and potable water are sometimes used in industrial plants requiring high-purity cooling water. Production of these high-purity waters creates waste byproduct brines containing the concentrated impurities from the source water.

In 2018, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder and University of Wyoming invented a radiative cooling metamaterial known as &quot;RadiCold&quot;, which has been developed since 2017. This metamaterial aids in cooling of water and increasing the efficiency of power generation, in which it would cool the underneath objects, by reflecting away the sun&#x27;s rays while at the same time allowing the surface to discharge its heat as infrared thermal radiation.

<text>A Regius Professor is a university professor who has, or originally had, royal patronage or appointment. They are a unique feature of academia in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The first Regius Professorship was in the field of medicine, and founded by the Scottish King James IV at the University of Aberdeen in 1497. Regius chairs have since been instituted in various universities, in disciplines judged to be fundamental and for which there is a continuing and significant need. Each was established by an English, Scottish, or British monarch, and following proper advertisement and interview through the offices of the university and the national government, the current monarch still appoints the professor (except for those at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, which left the United Kingdom in 1922). This royal imprimatur, and the relative rarity of these professorships, means a Regius chair is prestigious and highly sought-after.

Regius Professors are traditionally addressed as &quot;Regius&quot; and not &quot;Professor&quot;. The University of Glasgow currently has the highest number of extant Regius chairs, at fourteen.

Traditionally, Regius Chairs only existed in the seven ancient universities of the UK and Ireland. In October 2012 it was announced that Queen Elizabeth II would create up to six new Regius Professorships, to be announced in early 2013, to mark her Diamond Jubilee. In January 2013 the full list was announced, comprising twelve new chairs, probably the largest number ever created in one year, and more than created in most centuries. In July 2015 it was announced that further Regius Professorships would be created to mark the Queen&#x27;s 90th birthday.

<text>The A62 road in Northern England runs between the cities of Leeds in West Yorkshire and Manchester in Greater Manchester covering a distance of . It passes through Heckmondwike, Huddersfield, Oldham and Failsworth.

==Route==
The A62 begins at a junction with the A58 road as Gelderd Road in Leeds. It runs through West Yorkshire, passing through Birstall, Heckmondwike, Liversedge, Huddersfield, Linthwaite, Slaithwaite, and Marsden. It crosses the Pennines at Standedge, and continues through Saddleworth and into Oldham. From there, the A62 runs into Manchester as Oldham Street and Oldham Road through Failsworth, ending at the Manchester Inner Ring Road.

==History==
It is paralleled at some distance by part of the M62 Trans-Pennine motorway. Before the M62 was built, the A62 was the main trans-Pennine road between Oldham and Huddersfield. The M62 is numbered after the A62 and now takes most of the long-distance traffic between Manchester and Leeds (2023 Average daily traffic figures: M62: 110,000 A62: 5,885 .)

<text>Komsomolsk-on-Amur () is a city in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia, located on the west bank of the Amur River in the Russian Far East. It is located on the Baikal-Amur Mainline, northeast of Khabarovsk. Population: 

==History==
The future site of Komsomolsk-on-Amur was conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century, becoming part of the Yuan dynasty. It was later held by the Qing dynasty until the area was ceded to the Russian Empire in the treaty of Aigun in 1858. The village of Permskoye () was established on the later site of Komsomolsk in 1860 by migrant peasants from what was then called the Nizhne-Tambovsky District, Far Eastern Territory (now Khabarovsk Krai). 

The government of the Russian SFSR announced in 1931 plans to construct a shipyard on the Amur at the present site of Komsomolsk, with construction beginning in 1932. According to official mythology, the town was built using volunteer labor from the Communist youth organization Komsomol (and after 1991, the Russian Communist Youth League), and on that basis receiving the name Komsomolsk. However, the construction of the town was done with the extensive use of forced labour from the concentration camps under the Gulag administration, specifically the Dallag (Far East Camp) complex. The site had been the centre of the system for the Khabarovsk krai. According to Adashova and Kovalev, there was not a single entreprise constructed there in the 1930s or 1940s which had not involved Dallag forced labour, and at least 900 thousand of the mentioned forced labourers passed through the area throughout its existence. The suffix &quot;on Amur&quot; was added to differentiate from other towns with the same name. It was granted town status in 1933.

By the end of the 1940s, the shipyards along with facilities for other heavy industry had been completed. The city developed into a regional center for industries such as aircraft manufacturing, metallurgy, machinery, oil refining, and shipbuilding. At present, Komsomolsk-on-Amur is the main center for the manufacture of Sukhoi military aircraft and the Sukhoi Superjet airliner. The MiG-15bis and the Lisunov Li-2 were both manufactured in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Komsomolsk-on-Amur serves as the administrative center of Komsomolsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of krai significance of Komsomolsk-na-Amure—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Komsomolsk-na-Amure is incorporated as Komsomolsk-na-Amure Urban Okrug. The city is administratively divided into 2 okrugs (previously raion), coinciding with the historical parts: Leninsky (Dzemgi) and Central.

In the Soviet period, the administrative-territorial division of the city was different from the present.

==Layout==

Komsomolsk-on-Amur consists of two historical parts: the center, or &quot;city&quot;, where the main enterprise - Shipyard, and the Dzemgi - an area that has formed during the construction of an aircraft factory (future KnAAPO). In fact, each of the parts is a separate town, itself a single center in the city.

Areas of the city are very different architectural appearance: Center Stalinist buildings dominated the 40-50s (exception - the residential area near the railway station), Dzemgi is built up mainly typical panel apartment blocks. The &quot;sleeping&quot; area Dzemgi is not, as the majority of their residents work in enterprises located here.

Komsomolsk-on-Amur is an important industrial center of Khabarovsk Krai and of the Russian Far East. It has a diversified economy where machine building, metallurgy and timber enterprises dominate.

The city&#x27;s most notable company is Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, Russia&#x27;s largest aircraft-manufacturing enterprise. It is among Khabarovsk Krai&#x27;s most successful enterprises, and for years has been the largest taxpayer of the territory. It has manufactured hundreds of civil aircraft and thousands of various-role military aircraft from the first recon aircraft to modern Su- series fighters and light amphibian aeroplanes. The company is hugely important to the city&#x27;s economy, contributing 45% of all payments into the local budget.

Also based in the city is Amur Shipbuilding Plant, an important producer of ships and submarines.

The easternmost GLONASS telemetry and tracking station is located in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

Two air bases are located near the city, Khurba to the south and Dzemgi to the north.

The city is served by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Airport.

Public transport includes 5 tram routes, bus and fixed-taxi (marshrutka). However, since January 10, 2018 the tram has not been operated, due to &#x27;poor road condition&#x27; on Mira Prospect. It has yet to reopen and it was speculated that the suspension of tram traffic might become permanent.

<text>The A58 is a major road in Northern England running between Prescot, Merseyside and Wetherby, West Yorkshire.

==Route from West to East==
Its westbound start is at Prescot on the outskirts of Liverpool via Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire to the eastern terminus at Wetherby. The road goes through the following locations:

* St Helens 
* Ashton-in-Makerfield
* Hindley
* Westhoughton
* Bolton
* Bury
* Heywood
* Rochdale
* Littleborough 
* The Pennines
* Ripponden 
* Sowerby Bridge
* Halifax 
* Hipperholme
* Birkenshaw
* Drighlington
* New Farnley
* Leeds City Centre as the A58(M) motorway (part of the Leeds Inner Ring Road), 
* Scarcroft
* Bardsey
* Collingham 
* to its terminus at Wetherby

==History==
===Leeds to Wetherby===
The original route between Leeds and Wetherby has a dual carriageway diverting from Roundhay Road/Wetherby Road, at the old Fforde Grene junction in Harehills. It runs along the Easterly Road dual carriageway passing Oakwood and Gipton. The re-routed A58 meets its original route at Boggart Hill in Seacroft. The re-routed section was constructed in the 1930s and had a branch of the Leeds Tramway running along the central reservation until the 1950s. The proposed Leeds Supertram was also to run this route.

<doc id="531202" wikidata="Q238609" url="?curid=531202" title="Constance of Antioch">
<text>Constance of Hauteville (c. 1128–1163) was the ruling princess of Antioch from 1130 to 1163. She was the only child of Bohemond II of Antioch and Alice of Jerusalem. Constance succeeded her father at the age of two after he fell in battle, although his cousin Roger II of Sicily laid claim to Antioch. Alice assumed the regency, but the Antiochene noblemen replaced her with her father (Constance&#x27;s grandfather), Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After he died in 1131, Alice again tried to take control of the government, but the Antiochene barons acknowledged the right of her brother-in-law Fulk of Anjou to rule as regent for Constance.

Constance was given in marriage to Raymond of Poitiers in 1136. During the subsequent years, Raymond ruled Antioch while Constance gave birth to four children. After Raymond was murdered after a battle in 1149, Fulk of Anjou&#x27;s son Baldwin III of Jerusalem assumed the regency. He tried to persuade Constance to remarry, but she did not accept his candidates. She also refused to marry a middle-aged relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenus. Finally, she found a love interest and was married to Raynald of Châtillon, a knight from France, in 1153.

After her second husband fell into captivity around 11601161, Constance wanted to rule Antioch alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem declared her fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the lawful prince. Constance disregarded this declaration and took control of the administration of the principality with the assistance of Emperor Manuel. Constance was dethroned in favor of her son shortly before her death.

== Early life ==

Born in 1128, Constance was the only child of Prince Bohemond II of Antioch and Princess Alice, the second daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Constance of France. Bohemond was killed in a battle at the Ceyhan River in February 1130. After his death, Alice assumed the regency for Constance. According to rumors spreading in Antioch, Alice was planning to send Constance to a monastery or to marry her off to a commoner. Bohemond&#x27;s cousin Roger II of Sicily regarded himself as Bohemond&#x27;s lawful successor because he was the senior member of the House of Hauteville.

The Antiochene noblemen sent envoys to Baldwin II, urging him to come to the principality, but Alice decided to resist her father. The 12th-century historian, William of Tyre, also accused her of seeking assistance from Imad ad-Din Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo. According to William of Tyre&#x27;s account, her envoys were captured by BaldwinII&#x27;s soldiers, who had meanwhile reached Antioch. Before long, Alice was forced to beg for mercy from her father. He removed Alice from the regency, ordering her to leave Antioch.

== Reign ==

=== Childhood ===

The Antiochene noblemen acknowledged Baldwin II as regent, swearing fealty to him and Constance. He made Count Joscelin I of Edessa her guardian to rule the principality until her marriage. BaldwinII died on August21, 1131, and JoscelinI died a week later.

Alice again laid claim to the regency. However, most Antiochene lords remained hostile to the idea of a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII&#x27;s successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice&#x27;s brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Counts Joscelin II of Edessa and Pons of Tripoli in early 1132. King Fulk had to travel to Antioch by sea because Pons did not allow him to march through the County of Tripoli. Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Rainald I Masoir, constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.

Fulk returned to Antioch when Zengi dispatched Sawar, governor of Aleppo, to invade the principality in 1132 or 1133. After defeating the invaders, Fulk entered Antioch. Since the principality needed a firm government, the Antiochene noblemen approached Fulk to select a husband for Constance. He chose Raymond of Poitiers, the younger son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. He did not announce his decision in public because he wanted to prevent Alice and RogerII of Sicily from intervening.

Alice&#x27;s sister, Queen Melisende, Fulk&#x27;s wife, persuaded Fulk to allow Alice to return to Antioch in 1135. Alice wanted to tighten the relationship of the principality and the Byzantine Empire; therefore, she offered Constance&#x27;s hand to Manuel, a son of Emperor John II Komnenos. To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy to France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge him to come to Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.

=== First marriage ===

Raymond of Poitiers arrived at Antioch in April 1136. Ralph of Domfront, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, made Alice believe that Raymond came to Antioch to marry her instead of her eight-year-old daughter. However, Constance was kidnapped from the palace, and Ralph of Domfront blessed her marriage to Raymond in the cathedral. With the marriage, Raymond became the ruler of the principality, and Alice retired to Lattakieh.

In early 1147 Roger II of Sicily extended an offer to Louis VII of France to transport the French crusaders to the Holy Land during the Second Crusade. Fearing that Roger only wanted to assert his claim to Antioch, LouisVII and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (niece of Raymond of Poitiers) declined. Louis and his crusaders came to the principality in March 1148. Before long, rumors spread among the crusaders about a love affair between Raymond and Eleanor. The crusaders tried to convince her husband to launch a campaign against Aleppo, the capital of Nur ad-Din, but LouisVII decided to leave Antioch to Jerusalem, forcing Eleanor to accompany him.

=== Widowhood ===

Raymond was killed in the Battle of Inab during an expedition against Nur ad-Din Zangi on June29, 1149. Since Raymond and Constance&#x27;s four children were still underage, there was no one to &quot;perform the duties of a prince and raise the people from despair&quot;, according to William of Tyre. Nur ad-Din invaded the principality and seized all Antiochene territories to the east of the Orontes River. Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, directed the defense, but most noblemen preferred a secular ruler. After learning of Raymond&#x27;s fate, Constance&#x27;s cousin, Baldwin III of Jerusalem, hurried to Antioch and assumed the regency. He also concluded a truce with Nur ad-Din.

Baldwin III returned to Antioch in summer 1150. He wanted to persuade Constance to remarry, proposing three candidates (Yves, Count of Soissons, Walter of Saint Omer, and Ralph of Merle), but she declined. Urged by BaldwinIII, Constance went to Tripoli in early 1152 to meet him and her two aunts, Melisende and Hodierna. The two ladies tried to persuade Constance to choose among the three candidates, but she returned to Antioch without making a promise to remarry. According to William of Tyre, Patriarch Aimery convinced Constance to resist, because he wanted to control the government of the principality. The Byzantine Emperor ManuelI Komnenos sent his widowed brother-in-law, the middle-aged John Rogerios Dalassenos, to Antioch to marry Constance. However, because of his age, she &quot;regarded him with displeasure&quot;, according to the contemporaneous John Kinnamos, and refused to marry him.

Historian Steven Runciman says that Constance may have refused the candidates proposed by BaldwinIII and ManuelI because she had met Raynald of Châtillon, a knight from France. Even though William of Tyre described Raynald as a &quot;knight of common sort&quot;, Constance decided to marry Raynald. Their betrothal was kept secret because Constance wanted to obtain BaldwinIII&#x27;s permission for the marriage.

=== Second marriage ===

After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald married in early 1153. Raynald took charge of the administration of the principality. However, he was unpopular because his subjects regarded him as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald to pay homage to him in the spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.

After her husband fell into captivity, Constance announced her intention to administer the principality, but most Antiochene noblemen preferred a male ruler. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem hurried to Antioch and declared Constance&#x27;s fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the lawful prince, charging Patriarch Aimery with the administration of the principality. Constance did not accept Baldwin&#x27;s decision and protested against it to Emperor Manuel.

Manuel dispatched his nephew, Alexios Bryennios Komnenos, and John Kamateros to Antioch to begin negotiations about his marriage to Constance&#x27;s daughter, Maria. The marriage contract was signed and the emperor&#x27;s delegates confirmed Constance&#x27;s position as the ruler of the principality. BaldwinIII, who came to Antioch to meet the imperial envoys, did not protest.

Constance&#x27;s son, Bohemond, reached the age of majority in 1163. To strengthen her position against her son, Constance sought assistance from Constantine Kalamanos, Byzantine governor of Cilicia. However, the Antiochene barons made an alliance with Thoros II of Cilician Armenia and forced her to leave Antioch. After Constance&#x27;s removal, BohemondIII took control of the principality. Before long, Constance died, probably in Lattakieh or Byblos, according to Steven Runciman.

== Family ==
Constance&#x27;s first husband, Raymond of Poitiers, was the second son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine and his second wife, Philippa of Toulouse. He was born in 1114. According to William of Tyre, Constance was left with &quot;two sons and as many daughters still underage&quot; when her husband died in 1149. Their elder son, Bohemond, was five at the time of Raymond&#x27;s death. He seized Antioch from his mother in 1163. Constance and Raymond&#x27;s daughter Maria, famed for her beauty, married the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos in 1161. Another daughter, Philippa, was given in marriage to Humphrey II of Toron in the late 1160s.

Whether the father of Constance&#x27;s second son, Baldwin, was Raymond of Poitiers or Raynald of Châtillon cannot be determined with certainty. Baldwin died fighting at the head of a Byzantine cavalry regiment in the Battle of Myriokephalon on September17, 1176. It is certain that Raynald fathered Agnes, who became the wife of Béla III of Hungary. Raynald and Constance&#x27;s second daughter, Alice, became the third wife of Azzo VI of Este in 1204.

<text>The A28 is a trunk road in the counties of Kent and East Sussex in south east England, connecting Margate, Canterbury, Ashford and Hastings.

Starting at the seaside resort of Margate at the north-east point of Kent, the A28 runs inland and west-southwest to the cathedral city of Canterbury, before passing through the chalk hills of the North Downs via the gap cut by the River Stour, to the town of Ashford in the Vale of Holmesdale. From here, the A28 proceeds via the market town of Tenterden, to the East Sussex seaside town of Hastings, on the English Channel.

== Route ==
The A28 leaves Margate via the seaside resorts of Westgate and Birchington, and then heads inland reaching open countryside at the village of Sarre, after which the road roughly parallels both the Ashford-Ramsgate railway line and the Great Stour river on their combined route to Canterbury and then Ashford.

From Sarre, the road passes through the villages of Upstreet, Hersden and Sturry, and then to the city of Canterbury. It forms part of Canterbury&#x27;s ring road before leaving via Wincheap and Thanington Without, where a sliproad linking to the A2 was completed in 2011.

The A28 passes between the North Downs via the villages of Chartham, Chilham, Godmersham and Bilting, to enter the Vale of Holmesdale. The road reaches surburbia again at Kennington, a suburb of Ashford, but the A28 then skirts around the town centre of Ashford on a section of dual carriageway, where it has a junction with the A20. In 1983, this section was named &quot;Simone Weil Avenue&quot;, in honour of the French philosopher and mystic who is buried nearby in Bybrook Cemetery. Bypassing the village of Great Chart, the road undulates in a general south-westward direction around the Kentish Weald via the villages of Bethersden and High Halden, to the market town of Tenterden.

The A28 continues via the villages of Rolvenden and Newenden before crossing a narrow bridge over the River Rother and entering East Sussex via Northiam, beyond which the road becomes very winding. After the village of Brede there is a steep descent to bridge the river of the same name. Next is Westfield, just before the road climbs to terminate at its junction with the A21 just north of Hastings.

Work has continued to improve the A28 into the 21st century. In 2011 a new slip road was completed to connect the road to the A2 in Canterbury.

<text>The A33 is a major road in the counties of Berkshire and Hampshire in southern England. The road currently runs in three disjoint sections.

==Route==

===Reading–Basingstoke===
The first stretch of the A33 is a relatively new road, built as the A33 relief road, which starts on the Inner Distribution Road and bypasses most of suburban Reading, servicing the Kennet Island residential development, Madejski Stadium and Green Park Business Park, towards the M4, where it connects at junction 11. The first stretch of this road follows the route of the old Coley branch railway, including a passage under the railway era bridge carrying Berkeley Avenue. A two-year redevelopment scheme ran from early 2008 until late 2010, widening the northern section of the dual carriageway and significantly expanding and improving the motorway junction. The Mereoak Roundabout south of the motorway was replaced with two separate junctions with traffic lights.

The section south of the M4 is dual carriageway up to the county boundary with Hampshire, where it reverts to single carriageway towards Basingstoke.

===Basingstoke–Winchester===
The second section of the A33 starts near Popham, southwest of Basingstoke at a junction with the A30. The road from here to Winchester is a scenic mix of single and dual carriageway, that was progressively improved in the late 1960s. The route runs through much of the borough of Basingstoke and Deane. At Kings Worthy, the road diverts onto part of the original Winchester Bypass, constructed in the late 1930s, up to the A34.

===Southampton===
The third section of A33 starts at the Chilworth Roundabout, a junction with the A27 and M3, and runs south into the centre of Southampton and further south to Ocean Village. It then turns west and into dual carriageway at a roundabout near the Isle of Wight ferry terminal, past the docks and through Town Quay to run along West Quay Road, continuing past Leisure World and Ikea (which is partially responsible for congestion on the road and immediate surroundings due to its popularity, particularly on weekends). The A33 then bears left slightly to carry on along the Millbrook Road West dual carriageway to meet the M271 and A35 at Redbridge Flyover.

==History==
The A33 originally started at a junction with what was the A32 at Riseley Common and was a continuous route to Southampton Between Basingstoke and Southampton, it mostly followed the course of the historic Roman Road between these towns. This section of the route became part of the London–Southampton Trunk Road. The road was progressively detrunked as the M3 was extended.

The Winchester Bypass was constructed in the mid-1930s. While a significant improvement at the time, as other parts of the road were improved around it, it became increasingly ineffective and dangerous. The bypass was subsequently replaced by the completion of the M3 over Twyford Down, which generated a significant road protest.

<text>The A37 is a major road in south west England.

==Route==
It runs north from the A35 at Dorchester in Dorset into Somerset through Yeovil and Shepton Mallet before terminating at the Three Lamps junction with the A4 in central Bristol. The road is entirely single carriageway, except in the Yeovil and Bristol built-up areas, at Ilchester (where it multiplexes with the A303), and north of Dorchester. The road is one of the main routes connecting Bristol to the county of Dorset and is also a popular non-motorway route from Bristol to Exeter and Cornwall via the A303.

===Fosse Way===
From the Podimore roundabout northeast of Ilchester to Shepton Mallet the route traces that of the Fosse Way.

==The road today==
The road is subject to a stream of speed restrictions where it winds through a number of small villages. These parts of the road can be dangerous, especially where wide vehicles pass on sections where buildings are close to the road.

==History==
===1922 road classification=== 
The original A37 in 1922 started in Fortuneswell, Isle of Portland, however, the section to Dorchester
was soon renumbered A354, presumably to create a link between the major port of Weymouth and the A30 at Salisbury, from where the route would continue to London. Such a route has now been superseded by the M27 and M3.

One of the worst accident spots on the A37 was the A371 junction just south of Shepton Mallet. The junction was always very busy and suffered long traffic queues due to the nature of the road. The junction was also a point where traffic would converge or pass through from multiple locations, this was further exacerbated by the A361 Glastonbury junction which backed right onto the first junction. This muddled configuration resulted in numerous road traffic accidents, many of which were fatal.

After a long campaign for the junction to be replaced, a roundabout was constructed in 1999 significantly improving road safety and traffic flow. There have been few other construction schemes on the road in recent decades.

In recent years most of the overtaking lanes, provided on steep stretches just south of Bristol, have been blocked out with chevrons.

==Future==
A potential extension of the Avon Ring Road (A4174) from the Hicks Gate Roundabout between Keynsham and Bristol to the A37 south of Whitchurch would provide a direct link to the M32 and M4 north of Bristol.

<text>&quot;Slut (archaic: slattern)&quot; is an English-language term for a person, usually a woman, who is sexually promiscuous or considered to have loose sexual morals. It is predominately used as an insult, sexual slur or offensive term of disparagement. It originally meant &quot;a dirty, slovenly woman&quot;, and is rarely used to refer to men, generally requiring clarification by use of the terms &quot;male slut&quot; or &quot;man whore&quot;.

The word was used as early as the late 14th century (in the form of an adjective, &quot;sluttish&quot;, referring to a untidy appearance) by Geoffrey Chaucer in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.
From the late 20th century, there have been attempts to reclaim the word, exemplified by various SlutWalk parades, and some individuals embrace the title as a source of pride.

==Etymology, common usages and synonyms==
The common denotative meanings of &quot;slut&quot; are &#x27;sexually promiscuous woman&#x27;, or &#x27;immoral or dissolute woman; prostitute&#x27;. These definitions identify a slut as a woman of low character—a person who lacks the ability or chooses not to exercise a power of discernment to order her affairs. Similar terms used for men are &quot;cad&quot;, &quot;rake&quot;, &quot;male slut&quot;, &quot;man whore&quot;, &quot;himbo&quot;, &quot;womanizer&quot;, &quot;stud&quot;, and &quot;player&quot;. The adjective &quot;slutty&quot; carries a similar connotation, but can be applied both to people and to clothing and accessories, such as Halloween costumes.

Although the ultimate origin of the word &quot;slut&quot; is unknown, it first appeared in Middle English in 1402 as (AHD), with the meaning of &#x27;dirty, untidy, or slovenly woman&#x27;. Even earlier, Geoffrey Chaucer used the word &quot;sluttish&quot; () to describe a slovenly man; however, later uses appear almost exclusively associated with women. The modern sense of &#x27;sexually promiscuous woman&#x27; dates to at least 1450. The word was originally used around 1450 in the late Middle English language. It was used to describe a woman as dirty, or refer to her as a prostitute, harlot, or immoral woman. The word &quot;slut&quot; also took a similar form around the same era in the Norwegian language as &#x27;sleet&#x27;, also known as an impure liquor.

Another early meaning was &#x27;kitchen maid or drudge&#x27; (), a meaning retained as late as the 18th century, when hard knots of dough found in bread were referred to as &quot;slut&#x27;s pennies&quot;. An example of this use is Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diary description of his servant girl as &quot;an admirable slut&quot; who &quot;pleases us mightily, doing more service than both the others and deserves wages better&quot; (February 1664). &quot;Slut&quot; and &quot;slutishness&quot; occur in Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;As You Like It&quot;, written in 1599 or 1600. In the nineteenth century, the word was used as a euphemism in place of &quot;bitch&quot; in the sense of a female dog.

Today, the term &quot;slut&quot; has a pervasive presence in popular culture and pornography, but is almost exclusively used to describe women. An exact male equivalent of the term does not exist. The lack of a comparably popular term for men highlights the double standard in societal expectations (gender roles) between males and females, as negative terms for sexually promiscuous males are rare. Out of the 220 terms ascribed to females and 20 terms ascribed to males, all female terms are disapproving while some male terms signal approval or praise; these include &quot;stud&quot;, &quot;player&quot;, and &quot;man whore&quot;. While colloquial terms such as &quot;male slut&quot; or &quot;man whore&quot; are used in popular culture, they are usually used in a joking manner. There are, however, other terms that can be used to criticize men for their sexuality. For example, a man&#x27;s masculinity can be undermined by using terms such as &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;sissy&quot;, &quot;pussy,&quot; or &quot;whipped.&quot; They also dismiss female-on-male abuse, and are just as powerful and representative of modern societal prejudices. Hence, women may find it difficult to hold high positions at their workplace, whereas men may be mocked for choosing to be stay-at-home fathers. Although a sexually active and professionally successful woman might be seen as a threat, a man without those qualities is often regarded with suspicion and questions about his sexuality.

The word &quot;slut&quot; is commonly interchanged with the words &quot;tramp&quot;, &quot;whore&quot;, &quot;hoe&quot;, &quot;nympho&quot;, and &quot;hooker.&quot; All of these words have a very negative connotation. Additional meanings and connotations of the term are negative and identify a slut as being a slovenly and ugly person, for example, as in these quotations from OED2:


The attack on the character of the person is perhaps best brought together by the highly suggestive and related compound word, &quot;slut&#x27;s-hole&quot;, meaning a place or receptacle for rubbish; the associated quote provides a sense of this original meaning:

&quot;Slut&quot; can also be used as verb to denote behavior characterized as that of a slut. For example, in the 1972 play, &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, by Jason Miller, contained the exchange:

== Alternative usages and culture ==

=== General ===

The word &quot;slut&quot; is used as a slang term in the BDSM, polyamorous, and gay and bisexual communities. A parallel exists between the female term &quot;slut&quot; and the term &quot;gay&quot; for males. Unlike women, who are usually policed for being sexually promiscuous, men are often criticized for not being masculine or dominant enough, thus questioning their heterosexuality. Unlike women, who are expected to be sexually chaste, men are expected to be sexually active, thus having more sexual freedom. Although &quot;slut&quot; is rarely used to describe heterosexual men, it is commonly used among gay males. When discussing sexual activity, &quot;slut&quot; is used to shame gay men for taking sexual risks, such as unprotected sex or having multiple partners. However, if used in a humorous way, &quot;slut&quot; may also favor sexual freedom and mark the shift from traditional gender roles in gay men.

With BDSM, polyamorous, and non-monogamous people, in usage taken from the book &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot;, the term has been used as an expression of choice to openly have multiple partners, and revel in that choice: &quot;a slut is a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that &quot;sex is nice and pleasure is good for you&quot;.&quot; A &quot;slut&quot; is a person who has taken control of their sexuality and has sex with whomever they choose, regardless of religious or social pressures or conventions to conform to a strait-laced monogamous lifestyle committed to one partner for life.

The term has been reappropriated to express the rejection of the concept that government, society, or religion may judge or control one&#x27;s personal liberties, and the right to control one&#x27;s own sexuality. In April 2013, Emily Lindin, founder of the UnSlut Project, created a blog to share her stories on sexual bullying to &quot;provide some perspective to girls who currently feel trapped and ashamed&quot;. The blog now consists of entries from members of all ages, ethnicities, and genders. The film, &quot;UnSlut: A Documentary Film&quot;, coincides with the project and is screened across the country.

The double standard associated with slut-labeling is part of the modern day rape culture. Rape culture is &quot;the casual debasement [of women] ... that has become such a part of our lives that it is often invisible.&quot; Though people in society are vocally anti-rape, there is an insinuation that certain types of rape are acceptable or that women are voluntarily taking actions that justify sexual advances. &quot;For example, women continue to be blamed if they are raped because of how they are dressed, the assumption that women purportedly lie about being raped remains popular, and certain women, such as married women or women of colour, are still considered &#x27;unrapeable&#x27;&quot;. The word &quot;slut&quot; and the double standard it contains reflects the gender norms and gender biases that are prevalent in a culture in which rape is constantly justified. People from all sects of society contribute to this justification.

There have been many movements or &quot;SlutWalks&quot; taking place around the world to regain a sense of pride in women. Many slut walks or movements protest against the idea that a woman&#x27;s appearance, often considered promiscuous, is a justification of sexual assault and rape. The participants in these walks protest against individuals that excuse rape due to the woman&#x27;s appearance, including victim blaming and slut shaming; slut walks have now become a worldwide movement.

===Women of color===

The word &quot;slut&quot; means different things to white women and people of color, especially black women. &quot;Slut&quot; has different associations for black women. Anna North of &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered Leora Tanenbaum who stated, &quot;As Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves &#x27;slut&#x27; without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.&quot; She argued that, for black women, the word &quot;slut&quot; does not mean anything very harmful due to the history of being treated as slaves in the past. Black women&#x27;s &quot;relationship to the term &quot;slut&quot;&quot; is informed by a history of racism and slavery, of &quot;having been seen as objects of property, not just for the sexual gratification of those in power but also for reproduction of whole generations of slaves, which involved rape most of the time.&quot;

Most of the SlutWalks were coordinated by white women, and some black women felt uncomfortable when joining. Sociologist Jo Reger writes: &quot;Women of color ... argued that the white women organizers and participants had not considered the ways in which the sexuality of women of color had been constructed through a history of oppression, rape, and sexual exploitation.&quot; People of color, especially black people, had been avoiding words like &quot;slut&quot;, &quot;jezebel&quot;, &quot;hottentot&quot;, &quot;mammy&quot;, &quot;mule&quot;, &quot;sapphire&quot;, or &quot;welfare queens&quot;.

Model and actress Amber Rose was one of the first people to conduct and take a lead for a SlutWalk for people of color. &quot;The Amber Rose SlutWalk Festival is a completely inclusive space. This event is a zero tolerance event and we do not condone hateful language, racism, sexism, ableism, fat-shaming, transphobia or any other kind of bigotry. Further, we recognize that shaming, oppression, assault and violence have disproportionately impacted marginalized groups, including women of color, transgender people and sex workers, and thus we are actively working to center these groups at our events.&quot;

<doc id="531218" wikidata="Q499627" url="?curid=531218" title="Harmonia axyridis">
<text>Harmonia axyridis is a large lady beetle or ladybug species that is most commonly known as the harlequin, Asian, or multicoloured Asian lady beetle. This is one of the most variable species in the world, with an exceptionally wide range of colour forms. It is native to eastern Asia, but has been artificially introduced to North America and Europe to control aphids and scale insects. It is now common, well known, and spreading in those regions, and has also established in Africa and widely across South America. This species is conspicuous in North America, where it may locally be known as the Halloween beetle, as it often invades homes during October to overwinter.

When the species first arrived in the UK, it was labelled in jest as the &quot;many-named ladybird&quot; due to the great quantity of vernacular names. Among those already listed other names include multivariate, southern, Japanese, and pumpkin ladybird.

==Description==
&quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot; is a typical coccinellid beetle in shape and structure, being domed and having a &quot;smooth&quot; transition between its elytra (wing coverings), pronotum, and head. It ranges from 5.5–8.5mm in size. The common color form, f. &quot;succinea&quot;, is orange or red in colouration with 0–22 black spots of variable size. The other usual forms, f. &quot;conspicua&quot; and f. &quot;spectabilis&quot;, are uniformly black with, respectively, two or four red markings. The pronotum is white with variable black patterning, ranging from a few black spots in an M formation to almost entirely black. The underside is dark with a wide reddish-brown border.

However, numerous other forms have also been recorded. Extreme forms may be entirely black, or feature complex patterns of black, orange and red.

The large size of this species is usually the first clue to its identification. Despite variation, this species does not generally overlap in pronotal or elytral pattern with any other species, except in unmarked orange or red forms. In Europe it is similar to the much smaller &quot;Adalia decempunctata&quot;, while in America it is similar to the much smaller &quot;Mulsantina picta&quot; and spotless forms of &quot;Adalia bipunctata&quot;. When identification is difficult, the underside pattern usually enables a reliable conclusion. Identification is most simple for the common forms, while less common varieties may take longer to identify. They always have reddish-brown legs and are obviously brown on the underside of the abdomen, even in the melanic colour forms.

==Range==
&quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot; is native to eastern Asia from central Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan in the west, through Russia south to the Himalayas and east to the Pacific coast and Japan, including Korea, Mongolia, China, and Taiwan. As a voracious predator, it was identified as a biocontrol agent for aphids and scale insects. Consequently, it has been introduced into greenhouses, crop fields, and gardens in many countries, including the United States and parts of Europe. The species is now established in North America (United States, Canada, Mexico), Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama), South America (Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Chile), Europe (Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland), Israel, New Zealand, and South Africa.

===North America===

This species spread across continents because of human-mediated processes. They became established in North America as the result of introductions into the United States in an attempt to control the spread of aphids. In the last three decades, this insect has spread throughout the US and Canada, and has been a prominent factor in controlling aphid populations. The first introductions into the US took place as far back as 1916. The species repeatedly failed to establish in the wild after successfully controlling aphid populations, but an established population of beetles was observed in the wild near New Orleans, Louisiana, in about 1988. In the following years, it quickly spread to other states, being occasionally observed in the Midwest within five to seven years and becoming common in the region by about 2000. The species was also established in the Northwest by 1991, and the Northeast by 1994, aided by additional introductions from the native range, rather than just reaching there from the Southeast. Reportedly, it has heavily fed on soybean aphids (which recently appeared in the US after coming from China), supposedly saving farmers vast sums of money in 2001.

===Worldwide propagation===
Worldwide routes of propagation of &quot;H. axyridis&quot; were described with genetic markers in 2010. The populations in eastern and western North America originated from two independent introductions from the native range. The South American and African populations both originated independently from eastern North America. The European population also originated from eastern North America, but with substantial genetic admixture with individuals of the European biocontrol strain (estimated at 40%).

The species is widely considered to be one of the world&#x27;s most invasive insects, partly due to their tendency to overwinter indoors and the unpleasant odor and stain left by their bodily fluids when frightened or crushed, as well as their tendency to bite humans. In Europe it is currently increasing to the detriment of indigenous species, its voracious appetite enabling it to outcompete and even consume other ladybirds. The harlequin ladybird is also highly resistant to diseases that affect other ladybird species, and carries a microsporidian parasite to which it is immune, but that can infect and kill other species. Native ladybird species have experienced often dramatic declines in areas invaded by &quot;H. axyridis&quot;. In 2015, it was declared the fastest-invading species in the UK, spreading throughout the country after the first sighting was confirmed in 2004.

In addition to its household pest status, the harlequin has been reported to be a minor agricultural pest that has been inadvertently harvested with crops in Iowa, Ohio, New York State, and Ontario, causing a detectable and distinctly unpleasant taste, known as &quot;lady beetle taint&quot;. In particular, contamination of grapes by the beetle has been found to alter the taste of wine.

==Biology and behaviour==
&quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot; becomes dormant in cooler months, though it will move around whenever the temperature reaches about . Because the beetles will use crevices and other cool, dry, confined spaces to overwinter, significant numbers may congregate inside walls if given a large enough opening.

Large aggregations are often seen in autumn. The beetles have pheromones to signal to each other. However, many aggregation cues are visual, picking out sites at both long (light-coloured structures that are distinct from their surroundings) and short (pre-existing aggregations to join) distances. Non-volatile long-chain hydrocarbons laid down by previous aggregations also play a significant role in site selection. Both visual and hydrocarbon cues are more important than volatile pheromones.

They often congregate in sunlit areas because of the heat available, so even on fairly cold winter days, some of the hibernating beetles will &quot;wake up&quot; because of solar heating. Large populations can be problematic because they can form swarms and linger in an area for a long time. The beetles can form groups that stay in upper corners of windows. This beetle has been also found to be attracted to dark screening material for its warmth. It has good eyesight; it will return from a location to which it is removed, and is known to give a small bite if provoked.

&quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot;, like other ladybeetles or ladybirds, uses isopropyl methoxy pyrazine as a defensive chemical to deter predation, and also carries this chemical in its hemolymph at much higher concentrations than many other ladybeetle species, along with species-/genus-specific defensive compounds such as harmonine. These insects will &quot;reflex bleed&quot; when agitated, releasing hemolymph from their legs. The liquid has a foul odour (similar to that of dead leaves), a bitter taste, and can stain porous materials. Some people have allergic reactions, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis when exposed to these beetles. Occasionally, the beetles will bite humans, presumably in an attempt to acquire salt, although many people feel a pricking sensation as a beetle walks across the skin. Bites normally do no more harm than cause irritation, although a small number of people are allergic to bites. Their natural predators include birds, spined soldier bugs, ants (including the also invasive &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;) and other coccinellids, including fellow &quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot;.

These beetles can be difficult to identify because of their variations in color, spot size, and spot count of the elytra. The easiest way to identify &quot;H. axyridis&quot; f. succinea is to look at the pronotum and see whether the black markings look like a letter &quot;W&quot; or &quot;M&quot;. This species has more white markings on the pronotum than have most native North American species, though this feature is not useful when attempting to separate it from species in other parts of the world.

==Control==
Numerous methods of control have been investigated in areas where this beetle has been introduced and causes a threat to native species and biodiversity and to the grape industry. Methods of control include insecticides, trapping, removal of aggregates of beetles, and mechanically preventing entry to buildings. Methods under development involve the investigation of natural parasites and pathogens, including the use of parasitic sexually transmitted mites and fungal diseases.

The best methods for dealing with &quot;H. axyridis&quot; in private homes involve sealing openings they may enter. Sweeping and vacuuming are considered effective methods for removing them from homes, though this should be done carefully so as not to trigger reflex bleeding. A nylon stocking placed inside the vacuum cleaner&#x27;s hose, secured with a rubber band, allows the beetles to be &quot;bagged&quot; rather than collected inside the machine. A trap designed for indoor use was developed which attracts the beetles with a light and seals them in a removable bag.

== Biochemistry ==
&quot;Harmonia axyridis &quot;secretes a number of defensive compounds, one of which, (9Z,17R)-9-Octadecene-1,17-diamine () has been isolated from its hemolymph. This molecule has been reported to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that includes human pathogens. Antibacterial activity is most pronounced against fast-growing mycobacteria and &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, and the growth of both chloroquine-resistant &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; strains is also inhibited; causative agents of tuberculosis and malaria respectively.

<text>The A65 is a major road in England. It runs north west from Leeds in West Yorkshire via Kirkstall, Horsforth, Yeadon, Guiseley, Ilkley and Skipton, west of Settle, Ingleton and Kirkby Lonsdale before terminating at Kendal in Cumbria.

==Bypasses==
Listed from south to north, beginning at Leeds:

* The £5.5 million dual-carriageway Burley in Wharfedale Bypass opened in April 1995.
* The £4 million Addingham bypass opened in January 1991.
* The £2.8 million Draughton Bypass opened in December 1991.
* The north section of the £16.4 million Skipton Bypass opened in December 1981, which is part of the A59.
* North of Skipton, where the road meets the busy A629 from Bradford, there have been plans for a bypass around Gargrave, which is where the road crosses the Pennine Way.
* The £8.5 million Settle &amp; Giggleswick Bypass opened in December 1988.
* The Clapham bypass is the earliest of these bypasses. The National Archives have a file &quot;West Riding CC: Clapham Bypass (A65); consideration of proposals&quot; covering 1948–1969.

==Road safety==
The A65 between Long Preston and junction 36 of the M6 motorway has a poor safety record, according to EuroRAP being listed as a &quot;medium-high risk road&quot;. This stretch of single carriageway road suffered 48 fatal or serious injury accidents between 2002 and 2004. The road features in the list of highest risk roads in Britain (excluding motorcycle accidents). The section between Leeds and Long Preston is listed as being a &quot;low-medium risk road&quot;.

<doc id="531229" wikidata="Q2468294" url="?curid=531229" title="Sexaholics Anonymous">
<text>Sexaholics Anonymous (SA), founded in 1979, is one of several twelve-step programs for compulsive sexual behavior, based on the original twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. SA is part of a group of twelve-step organization addressing sexual addiction: Sex Addicts Anonymous(SAA), Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous(SLAA), Sexual Compulsives Anonymous(SCA) and Sexual Recovery Anonymous(SRA). Collectively, these groups are known as &quot;S&quot; groups due to their acronyms Starting with &quot;S&quot;: SA, SAA, SLAA, SCA, and SRA.

SA supports individuals who identify as &quot;sexaholics.&quot; According to the group, a sexaholic is someone for whom &quot;lust has become an addiction.&quot; SA distinguishes itself from other &quot;S&quot; groups by defining sexual sobriety as no sex with self or with partners other than with one&#x27;s spouse &quot;in a marriage between a man and a woman,&quot; and progressive victory over lust.

&quot;In defining sobriety, we do not speak for those outside Sexaholics Anonymous. We can only speak for ourselves. Thus, for the married sexaholic, sexual sobriety means having no form of sex with self or with persons other than the spouse. For the unmarried sexaholic, sexual sobriety means freedom from sex of any kind. And for all of us, single and married alike, sexual sobriety also includes progressive victory over lust.&quot;

The group uses the &quot;Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; and the book &quot;Sexaholics Anonymous&quot; (often referred to as &quot;The White Book&quot;) as guide. &quot;The White Book&quot; explains that &quot;the sexaholic has taken himself or herself out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. He or she has lost control, no longer has the power of choice, and is not free to stop.&quot;

==History==
Sexaholics Anonymous was founded by Roy K. (in twelve-step fellowships it is customary to refer to members by their first name and the first initial of their last name, in order to preserve their anonymity). SA received permission from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to use its Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions in 1979.

Roy K. died from cancer on the afternoon of September 15, 2009. He claimed that he had been sexually sober since January 31, 1976.

=== Group commitment to sobriety definition ===

From the earliest attempts by Roy K. to found SA in the 1970s, and throughout the history of SA, some members have sought to change the group&#x27;s concept of sexual sobriety. This was an attempt to generalize marriage similar to the 12 Step concept from Step 3 of &quot;God as you understand God.&quot; It was an attempt to endorse as sexually sober, sexual activity by couples, not legally married, whether they be of the same or opposite sex. The fellowship did not accept this and, as a result, in 1991 some SA members and groups left SA to form Sexual Recovery Anonymous (SRA), citing the SA sobriety definition&#x27;s lack of endorsement of same sex relationships and committed relationships. Murray R., one of the SRA founders had served on the SA General Service Board and had long attempted to change the SA sobriety definition to include committed relationships with either the same or opposite sex.

As early as 1991 Roy was writing to the fellowship regarding same-sex acting out. In an article titled Principles Corroborating SA&#x27;s Interpretation of Sexual Sobriety Roy wrote:

In the section titled &quot;The Great Same-Sex Controversy&quot;, Roy goes on to explain how society was divided on the &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; argument about homosexuality:

The issue came up again in the late 1990s. A survey was held, reaching out to various individual meetings through the regional councils and local Intergroups. A solid majority of responders felt that the sobriety definition did not require clarification. Agitation on the issue continued due to a perception that the ambiguous nature of the survey questions rendered the results meaningless. The Chair of the SA General Delegate Assembly summed up this ambiguity: &quot;I received conflicting opinions about the meaning of the January 1999 vote that we do not need to clarify the SA sobriety definition. Many (probably most) were convinced this vote meant that we are already clear on the meaning of traditional SA sobriety and no further clarification is needed. Others were equally convinced this vote meant that &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;marriage&quot; could be interpreted as understood by each member. Some were convinced that SA is afraid to &quot;say what it means and mean what it says.&quot;

On July 9, 1999, the General Delegate Assembly, meeting at an international conference in Cleveland, unanimously voted (9-0) to clarify the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; to be &quot;one&#x27;s partner in a marriage between a man and a woman.&quot; This is known as the Cleveland Clarification or the Cleveland Statement of Principle. It was overwhelmingly accepted by the membership at the group, intergroup and regional levels. In 2000, same-sex attracted SA members expressed their support for the Cleveland Clarification in a letter to SA Delegates and Trustees signed by 66 members from 7 countries. Candidates for membership in the SA Board of Trustees, are now required to affirm the SA Sobriety Definition including the Cleveland Clarification.

This controversy continues to circulate within the fellowship. The General Delegate Assembly (GDA) &quot;is the policy-making body of SA.&quot; Any Delegate is free to propose a motion at the GDA to debate the SA sobriety definition. SA Conferences are about recovery, not for debating policy matters like the sobriety definition. ESSAY, the bimonthly international SA newsletter, states the principle in its Editorial Philosophy: &quot;SA’s sobriety definition is not debated, since it distinguishes SA from other sex addiction fellowships.&quot;

In July 2016, the GDA passed a motion further entrenching the 1999 Cleveland Statement of Principle: &quot;In SA&#x27;s sobriety definition, the term &quot;spouse&quot; refers to one&#x27;s partner in a marriage between a man and a woman.&quot; The motion requires the inclusion of the Statement of Principle in all SA literature on the SA website home page. Further, the motion declared that &quot;Meetings that do not adhere to and follow [...] the Statement of Principle [...] are not SA meetings and shall not call themselves SA meetings.&quot;

SA has attracted a subsection of the same-sex attracted population who seek not to act sexually on such attractions. At the July 2007 SA International Convention a survey was conducted of 176 SA members. Asked the object of their sexual fantasy and acting out, 23% nominated same-sex and a further 7% indicated both genders. Topic meetings on same-sex issues are held at SA International Conferences and personal stories of same–sex recovery appear in ESSAY, the official SA publication. There also exist other organizations which serve such individuals (see ex-gay movement).

==International conventions==
All SA &amp; S-Anon conventions from inception to 2016 have been held in the United States, except July 1992 and July 1997 which were both held in Canada. In 2017, the first SA International Convention was held outside North America was in Israel. In January 2019, they held their first convention in Spain.

== Literature ==
SA fully accepts all AA General Conference-approved literature for use in SA meetings, and SA groups frequently read from AA literature in their own meetings. SA adheres closely to the AA model, applying all of AA&#x27;s principles to lust and sexual addiction, and whereas other members of other S-groups define sobriety for themselves, SA is closer to AA in proposing an understanding of sobriety which requires abstinence and is common to the group.

== Criticism ==
A psychologist involved in sexual addiction treatment, Patrick Carnes, encourages self-defined sobriety in his writings, saying that a no-masturbation definition of sobriety is only appropriate for some sex addicts and that bottom lines can in fact be modified over time. Joe Kort criticizes SA for its pro-heterosexual marriage stance.

However, founder Roy K. knew ahead of time that this was a controversial subject and often wrote letters from a contrarian perspective. &quot;If we come into an SA group where we can define our own sobriety, watch those rationalizations come alive! And if we define our own level of sobriety, that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re likely to reach.&quot; In addition, Roy studied theology for many years at a seminary. He often would leave an SA convention where he was one of the keynote speakers and preach at a church around the corner for those interested in listening to a more evangelical point of view. &quot;We don&#x27;t claim to understand all the ramifications of sexual sobriety. Some of us have come to believe that there is a deeper spiritual significance in sexual sobriety, while others simply report that without a firm and clear bottom line, our &quot;cunning, baffling, and powerful&quot; sexaholism takes over sooner or later.

<text>UAN is a solution of urea and ammonium nitrate in water used as a fertilizer. The combination of urea and ammonium nitrate has an extremely low critical relative humidity (18% at 30 °C) and can therefore only be used in liquid fertilizers. The most commonly used grade of these fertilizer solutions is UAN 32.0.0 (32%N) known as UN32 or UN-32, which consists of 45% ammonium nitrate, 35% urea and only 20% water. Other grades are UAN 28, UAN 30 and UAN 18.
The solutions are quite corrosive towards mild steel (up to per year on C1010 steel) and are therefore generally equipped with a corrosion inhibitor to protect tanks, pipelines, nozzles, etc. Urea–ammonium nitrate solutions should not be combined with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN-17) or other solutions prepared from calcium nitrate. A thick, milky-white insoluble precipitate forms that may plug nozzles.

== Physical and chemical characteristics of urea ammonium nitrate solutions==
The solutions contain a remarkably low amount of water and nevertheless have a low salt-out temperature:

<text>Moshe Zalman Feiglin (; born 31 July 1962) is a right libertarian-leaning Israeli politician and activist, and the leader of libertarian Zionist party Zehut. As a member of Likud, he headed the Manhigut Yehudit (&quot;Jewish Leadership&quot;) faction within the party, and represented Likud in the Knesset between 2013 and 2015.

Prior to becoming a Knesset member, Feiglin co-founded the Zo Artzeinu (&quot;This is our Land&quot;) movement with Shmuel Sackett in 1993 to protest the Oslo Accords. On 8 August 1995, eighty intersections throughout the country were blocked in a massive act of non-violent civil disobedience against the Oslo process. As a result of his activities, Feiglin was sentenced to six months in prison in 1997 for sedition against the state by Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court. The sentence was later commuted to community service. In November 1996, Feiglin established the Manhigut Yehudit movement; it joined Likud in 2000, with Feiglin declaring that he would be a candidate for chairmanship of the party as a springboard for premiership of the State of Israel.

In early January 2015, Feiglin announced that he was leaving the Likud and forming his own party, after the Likud primaries the previous month.

Feiglin complained about efforts that were done to try to keep him out of Israel&#x27;s parliament, the Knesset. He referred to alleged political corruption in the Likud primary and legal maneuvers Benjamin Netanyahu took in the past to move him down the party’s list, accusing the prime minister of trying to assassinate him politically.

As a result of the above issues and timing, Feiglin did not form a new party for the Knesset elections in March, and instead decided to take his time to build a strong new party (&quot;If we have to give up on the coming Knesset to build ourselves well and fundamentally, we will do so. We will take the time that we need to build ourselves in the proper and most exacting way.&quot;). In July 2021, Feiglin returned to the Likud. In January 2024, Feiglin left Likud and reestablished Zehut. 

Feiglin&#x27;s party Zehut is in favor of legalizing marijuana.

==Biography==
Moshe Feiglin was born in Haifa, the son of Ya&#x27;akov Zvi and Esther Feiglin. His ancestors moved to Palestine, from Imperial Russia during the First Aliyah. His grandfather was the first child born in Metula, and some of his ancestors were among the founders of several settlements, including Mishmar HaYarden, Hadera, and Kinneret. His father served in the Jewish Settlement Police during the British Mandate era. His family later moved to Rehovot, where he attended the local Tachkemoni school of the Mizrachi movement, and subsequently graduated from Rabbi Haim Drukman&#x27;s Yeshivat Or Etzion. They are also related to Rebbes of The Chabad Dynasty.

During his IDF national service, Feiglin served in the Engineering Corps. He later signed on to one additional year as a career soldier, and attained the rank of captain. He fought in the 1982 Lebanon War.

Feiglin ran a company that used rope rappelling in the construction industry.

Feiglin is married, and has five children, and lives in the settlement of Karnei Shomron.

==Political career==
===Manhigut Yehudit===
Feiglin co-founded the Manhigut Yehudit movement in 1996. It began as a brainchild of Feiglin and a friend of his, Moti Karpel, who established the organization as the continuation of the Zo Artzeinu protest movement. The main tactical difference between the two in Feiglin&#x27;s thought is that Zo Artzeinu protested government policy without suggesting an alternative, whereas Manhigut Yehudit seeks to become the government and be the alternative.

Lacking the tools to do this, and without a political party with which to stake his run, he was approached by a founding member of the Likud party and participant in the Zo Artzeinu protests who proposed that Feiglin register for the Likud party and register, in turn, the thousands who participated in the protests, thereby building a support base for himself in the party, from which he could run for the party presidency and, in turn, Prime Minister.

According to Feiglin&#x27;s own words, Manhigut Yehudit was started to &quot;return the country to the people and lead the State of Israel through authentic Jewish values&quot;.

Feiglin says that the movement&#x27;s leadership will arise from &quot;those who have a deep commitment to Torah values&quot;. Still, 30 percent of its present members are secular (2005). He opposes the surrender of what he regards as Jewish land, and has demanded the government take action against the estimated 50,000 illegal Arab structures built throughout the country. Feiglin has stated that Likud had &quot;given up true Likud values and acquiesced in the Gaza evacuation&quot;.

===Likud===

Feiglin was a minor candidate in the 2002 Likud leadership election.

In 2005, Feiglin again ran for Likud chairman and won 12.5% of the votes, coming third out of seven candidates, after Benjamin Netanyahu and Silvan Shalom. He attempted to run for a slot on the party&#x27;s Knesset list, but encountered severe opposition from Netanyahu, who delayed party elections and advocated making changes to its charter to bar &quot;anyone who has served three or more months in prison&quot; from running as a Likud MK. This would have prevented Feiglin, who served a six-month sentence in the mid-1990s for civil disobedience, from running for either an MK or leadership position in the future. Feiglin withdrew from the race on 3 January 2006, following the release of a statement from the Likud party election chairman declaring, in agreement with a prior decision by the Israeli High Court, that Feiglin&#x27;s conviction was not for &quot;dishonorable&quot; violations of the law, allowing him to participate in future Likud affairs.

In the 14 August 2007 primaries, Feiglin nearly doubled his previous showing and received 23.4% of the votes to Netanyahu&#x27;s 72.8%. Netanyahu, fearing a strong showing by Feiglin, tried to have him ousted from the party prior to the vote, and said he would continue such efforts. On 10 December 2008, Feiglin was won twentieth place in the Likud primaries. On 11 December, following a petition submitted against him by Ophir Akunis, he was demoted to the 36th spot.

In an article written in 2009, Feiglin stated: &quot;Sad to say, Prime Minister Netanyahu is a pitiful puppet of Peres and his cohorts.&quot;

Feiglin ran against Netanyahu again in the 2012 Likud leadership election, held on 31 January 2012, and again received 23% of the vote. In the Likud primaries held in late 2012 to select candidates for the 2013 elections, Feiglin finished thirteenth, and was elected to the Knesset in the 2013 elections.

Feiglin served as Deputy Speaker in the 19th Knesset. He and his Manhigut Yehudit faction suffered a serious setback in the December 2014 Likud primaries, held in the run-up to the 2015 Knesset elections, when he fell to the 36th position on the Likud list, making it unlikely he would be returned to the Knesset. In January 2015, he announced that he was leaving Likud to form his own party, although he did not do so in time for the elections. Shortly after the elections, he announced that the new party was to be called Zehut (&quot;Identity&quot;).

In July 2021, Feiglin returned to the Likud.

==Views and opinions==
Feiglin has openly stated that, though he is not opposed to peace, peace is not his goal, and would not be on the top of his agenda as Prime Minister. Rather, Feiglin&#x27;s focus is on reforming Israel as an essentially Jewish State by acting on several campaigns on the religious, social, legal, and security fronts.

In a May 2012 article on liberty that originally appeared on the NRG &quot;Maariv&quot; Hebrew website, Feiglin wrote: &quot;Liberty means fighting against coercion of all kinds; religious, anti-religious, economic, cultural, educational, and more. Liberty means allocating state land to the citizen. It means privatization of government firms to the public, and not to core shareholders. Liberty means liberalized communication - broadcasting license and not broadcast franchise. You want to open up a television or radio station? Buy a wavelength and broadcast as you please within the framework of the law. Liberty means restoring the responsibility for education to the parents, using the education coupon method. It means a gradual transfer to a professional volunteer army. Liberty means prohibiting biometric data bases or any other type of human designation. There is no difference in principle between sophisticated biological marking and tattooing an ID number; both turn our identities into the property of a third party. In both, we lose our freedom. Simply put: We have one G-d above us, and we should not be enslaved to another person or mechanism. The state is ours, and under no circumstance is the opposite true.&quot;

He is against religious coercion and the establishment of religious political parties. He has come out against legislation such as the Chametz Law, which forbids selling leavened products on the Passover Holiday, when eating or owning leavened food products is prohibited by Jewish law.

He is also a proponent of the civil marriage initiative in Israel which would allow any Israeli citizen to marry without a religious cleric. At present, marriage in Israel is impossible outside the confines of a religious system; hence, for tens of thousands of people with problematic religious status, it is impossible ever to get married in the country. The present system also places the power of divorce in the hand of the Religious courts, who are answerable only to the Supreme Courts. The civil marriage initiative would make the religious nature of marriage entirely voluntary, effectively separating religion and state in this matter.

Feiglin has advocated removing the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf&#x27;s control over the entire al-Aqsa complex, and suggested a synagogue should be established on the Temple Mount. In February 2014, at Feiglin&#x27;s insistence, the Knesset debated the status of the Temple Mount. Feiglin&#x27;s platform states:&quot;We have to internalize that this is our Land - exclusively... Most important: We must expel the Moslem wakf from the Temple Mount and restore exclusive Israeli sovereignty over this most holy site.&quot;

In July 2014, during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Feiglin outlined steps toward &quot;achieving quiet in Gaza&quot;. His plan included attacking all of Gaza, its infrastructure and military sites, without regard to civilian &quot;human shields&quot;. After conquering and annexing Gaza into Israel, that portion of Gaza&#x27;s &quot;enemy population that is innocent of wrong-doing and separated itself from the armed terrorists will be treated in accordance with international law and will be allowed to leave&quot;. After becoming part of Israel, Gaza would be re-populated by Jews. He said the civilians of Gaza could go to Sinai, and his plan would also &quot;ease the housing crisis in Israel&quot;. Feiglin criticized lawmaker Aliza Lavie for discussing legislation on sexual violence, protesting that in wartime, no one should be &quot;talking about things like flowers and sexual assault&quot;.

On August 4, 2014, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; tabloid newspaper alleged that Feiglin had called for concentration camps in Gaza. In a TV show with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer, Feiglin denied that claim, saying he was talking about creating &quot;sheltered areas&quot; for the civilians of Gaza so that Israel could stop rockets by Hamas in a more effective way. He also said that he &quot;definitely&quot; supported &quot;tent encampments&quot; before the people in Gaza can be relocated to another place.

In 2008, Feiglin has proposed a plan to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. His plan would include annexing all post-1967 land currently in Israel&#x27;s hands and offering financial incentive for Palestinian families in these areas to emigrate to other countries. Feiglin pointed to a poll by An-Najah University in Nablus, which showed that one in three Palestinian Arabs would emigrate to other countries even without a financial incentive, as supporting his plan. Feiglin also proposed that Israel actively encourage Israeli-Arabs to emigrate to the Arab world, and provide assistance to any Arab who chooses to do so.

About 20% of Israel&#x27;s citizens are Israeli Arabs. Feiglin was asked about Israel&#x27;s status as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state&quot; in a 2004 interview, and stated: &quot;Why should non-Jews have a say in the policy of a Jewish state? ... For two thousand years, Jews dreamed of a Jewish state, not a democratic state. Democracy should serve the values of the state, not destroy them...&quot;

In 2003, Feiglin proposed replacing the Knesset with a bicameral legislature, whose upper house, which would control all &quot;national affairs&quot;, would be &quot;composed exclusively of Jews&quot;. Point three in the program states that he will enact a new Basic Law which will set forth a detailed proposal for a constitution. The Law will replace the at-large election of the Knesset with regional representatives, and would also create a lower house to handle municipal issues, in which Israeli Arabs could be represented. The posting was taken down on December 9, 2008, the day after Feiglin won twentieth place in the Likud primaries. However, the posting had been archived by Israeli scholar Tomer Persico prior to being removed, and Persico wrote a 2012 article analyzing Feiglin&#x27;s program, referencing the 2003 posting.

On 3 April 2019, Feiglin gave a speech at Maariv Jerusalem Post conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, in which he called to rebuild the Third Temple on Temple Mount immediately. He said in a statement: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to build a Third Temple in one or two years, I want to build it now. To build the Temple, I need support; I can&#x27;t do it alone.&quot;

On 15 June 2024, Feiglin said, in the context of the Gaza war, &#x27;As Hitler said &#x27;I can&#x27;t live if one Jew is left,&#x27; we can&#x27;t live here if one &#x27;Islamo-Nazi&#x27; remains in Gaza and not before we return to Gaza and turn it into Hebrew Gaza&#x27;.

==Published works==
In his 2005 book &quot;War of Dreams&quot;, Feiglin wrote that his program was: &quot;Israeli citizenship to Jews only [and] the immediate expulsion of any person of another people who claims any sort of sovereignty in the Land of Israel.&quot;&quot;We are busy fighting for Yesha, and refuse to recognize the more dangerous front against the fifth column inside Israel.&quot; &quot;We established a state so that we could stop being different and start being normal. If only Jews can be Israelis, then we will never be normal. . . .The fundamental solution is leadership that is not looking for normalcy. The solution is leadership that emphasizes our Jewish identity. Paradoxically, it is only when the Arabs understand that the Israelis do not need them to help them to forget that they are Jews - will we be able to live here in peace with non-Jews who unequivocally accept the fact that Israel is a Jewish state.&quot; It appears that the Israeli Arabs identify with our enemies. There are laws in this country that deal with treason and they should be applied when required. If Israeli Arabs are found helping our enemies, they should be stripped of their citizenship. In addition, if they are citizens, they should not be exempt from paying taxes; they should serve in the IDF, or at least in Sherut Le&#x27;umi, the National Service. . . . .If they are against us, we must make every effort to ensure that they leave. If they collaborate with our enemy, they must be removed.

==Controversy and criticism==

===Comments on Arabs===
Of Israeli Arabs, Feiglin said, &quot;They will have to seek the right to self-determination in Arab states. Israel will encourage the Arabs to emigrate to their countries and assist any Arab who wishes to do so.&quot; He insisted there is no such thing as a Palestinian people, and that they and Israeli Arabs should relocate, citing a text he had posted on the website of his Manhigut Yehudit (&quot;Jewish Leadership&quot;) movement. In a 2004 interview with &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, he spoke of &quot;a voluntary transfer to the 22 neighbouring Arab states&quot; of the some 1.4 million Israeli Arabs, who make up 20 percent of Israel&#x27;s population. &quot;Arabs are not the sons of the desert, but its father&quot;, he quoted Sir Claude Jarvis, British governor of Sinai from 1923.

In a 2004 report in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Feiglin was quoted as saying: &quot;Why should non-Jews have a say in the policy of a Jewish state?... For two thousand years, Jews dreamed of a Jewish state, not a democratic state. Democracy should serve the values of the state, not destroy them... You can’t teach a monkey to speak and you can’t teach an Arab to be democratic. You’re dealing with a culture of thieves and robbers. The Arab destroys everything he touches.&quot;

In an interview with the U.S.-based &quot;The Jewish Press&quot;, Feiglin said: &quot;You can find places where we say the same things. You can also find places where we are different. I was in the army when Meir, Hashem yikom damo [may God avenge his blood], was [most] active, so I didn&#x27;t get to know him so well. But I can definitely say that the slogan &#x27;Kahane tzadak - Kahane was right&#x27; has proven itself many times.&quot; 
Several commentators have depicted Feiglin as a fascist. 

In 2013, he set forth his legislative agenda regarding Israeli Arabs: &quot;Zero tolerance for Arab citizens&#x27; defiance. Enforcement of laws of treason. Enforcement of laws against robbery, rape, and vandalism.&quot; 
Feiglin, responding to a report that Israel&#x27;s first permanent Arab Supreme Court judge Salim Joubran had refused to sing Israel&#x27;s national anthem, asserted that Joubran &quot;must return his Israeli ID card and make do with the status of &#x27;permanent resident&#x27;&quot;.

According to a 2012 article in &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Feiglin condemned Baruch Goldstein over his killing of 29 Palestinian Muslims in a mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, though he did not condemn Goldstein&#x27;s motivations.

=== Hitler comments===
In an article in &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Yossi Sarid quoted Feiglin, in the context of demonstrations against the Oslo accords, as saying, &quot;Hitler was an unparalleled military genius. Nazism promoted Germany from a low to a fantastic physical and ideological status. The ragged, trashy youth body turned into a neat and orderly part of society and Germany received an exemplary regime, a proper justice system and public order. Hitler savored good music. He would paint. This was no bunch of thugs. They merely used thugs and homosexuals.&quot; Feiglin clarified his position to the &quot;Maariv&quot; newspaper that just because he considers Hitler a military genius, this does not mean he admires him.

===Banned from Britain===
Feiglin is banned from entering the United Kingdom due to a decision by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, made public in March 2008, excluding Feiglin on the grounds that his presence in the country &quot;would not be conducive to the public good&quot;. A letter to Feiglin from the Home Office said that Smith based her decision on an assessment that his activities &quot;foment or justify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs; seek to provoke others to terrorist acts; foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to serious criminal acts; and foster hatred, which might lead to inter-community violence in the UK&quot;. Feiglin responded, &quot;Seeing that renowned terrorists like Hizbullah member Ibrahim Mousawi are welcomed in your country in open arms, I understand that your policy is aimed at encouraging and supporting terror.&quot;

===Oslo Accords===
Feiglin was arrested for organizing mass acts of resistance and blocked highways across Israel during the period in which the Oslo accords were debated and implemented. Feiglin was charged with &quot;break[ing] the barrier of obedience to the rule of law&quot; and incitement to commit crimes. Regarding his organization of peaceful demonstrations and the blocking of intersections without a permit, Feiglin was quoted as stating, &quot;We will do all that it&#x27;s possible to do, including breaking the law.&quot;
He was sentenced to six months in prison in 1997 for sedition, and the sentence was later performed via community service.

===Likud members===
Relations between Feiglin and his fellow Likud members have been mixed. Likud Knesset member Limor Livnat stated that Feiglin and his friends are &quot;not real Likudniks&quot;, and that his faction &quot;cannot be allowed to prevail&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, Livnat explained that Feiglin and his faction must be prevented &quot;from taking over, or the party and the state will be in danger&quot;, adding that, &quot;this is not democracy, this is anarchy&quot;.

Despite criticism from fellow Likud members, Feiglin has displayed favorable relations with a significant number of former Likud Knesset members. This was manifest during a Feiglin rally at Jerusalem&#x27;s Ramada Hotel that took place before the 2008 Likud primary after Feiglin promised to throw all his votes to them if they showed up. Former Likud Knesset members Gila Gamliel, David Mena, Daniel Benlulu, and Ayoub Kara attended the event, despite warnings from Netanyahu&#x27;s advisers not to do so. Gila Gamliel, who did not vote against the Disengagement from Gaza, eventually took Feiglin&#x27;s votes and placed 19th, one spot ahead of Feiglin. This ultimately resulted in Feiglin getting pushed down to the 36th spot, and out of the Eighteenth Knesset.

===Support for Jonathan Pollard===
Feiglin is a highly vocal supporter of Jonathan Pollard, a former American naval intelligence analyst who formerly served a sentence in the American Federal prison system for spying for Israel. Feiglin, who has called Pollard a hero, has written a number of articles in support of Pollard. In a later 2008 article, Feiglin stated that, &quot;Pollard is a Jew who saved the Israelis from American treachery.&quot;

===Criticism of U.S. Vice President Biden===

Feiglin referred to U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden as a &quot;diseased leper&quot; in a 2010 op-ed column published by Israel&#x27;s third-largest news outlet, &quot;Maariv&quot;.

=== Support for cannabis legalization ===

As part of his libertarian political philosophy, Feiglin supports the full legalization of cannabis in Israel, stating of legalization in Amsterdam: &quot;I don&#x27;t see Amsterdam as a bad thing. ... There&#x27;s no chaos, there&#x27;s more freedom for citizens. [Legalization] didn&#x27;t upend the way of life.&quot; And stating that, &quot;This may be one of the reasons why marijuana is illegal. God owns the patent on cannabis, and the large pharmaceutical companies do not appreciate such an intervention in their market and exert their influence accordingly.&quot; The opposition of the Knesset Health committee to Feiglin&#x27;s proposals have led to multiple controversial confrontations in the Knesset. Feiglin says that, &quot;When I expressed my opinion on this issue over a year ago, I had no idea that I had climbed atop such a potent barrel of social dynamite... The debate is not about cannabis. Cannabis is just the tip of the iceberg. The debate is about liberty.&quot;

===Approach to homosexuals===
Feiglin wrote an article in 2009 entitled &quot;I Am A Proud Homophobe&quot;. In 2012, he wrote several posts on his Facebook page detailing his views on gays. &quot;The gay pride parade isn&#x27;t about rights. It&#x27;s about forcing the values of the minority onto the majority, effectively locking the majority into the proverbial closet. Homosexual &quot;rights&quot; undermine the normative family, the foundation of our nation.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Throughout history&quot;, Feiglin explained, &quot;from Rome to Europe in our day, the approval and spread of homosexuality presaged the decline of nations and cultures. If one reads the Torah portion &#x27;Noah&#x27; - this comes as no surprise. . . .The organizers of a pride parade do not wish to gain rights. They strive to force homosexuality as a culture upon the public sphere. . . . A minority has no right to take over public assets. Let the marchers kindly go back to their individual closets. And let them do it without whining, because no one interferes with their affairs in there. Let them give up their attempts at takeovers, and leave the public sphere to normal people. . . .Feiglin added in an additional post: &quot;I have no problem with homosexuals, most of whom are, most likely, good and talented people and no one wants to interfere in their private lives. I have a problem with homosexuality as a culture. This culture subverts the status of the family. And without the family there is no nation, and without a nation there is no civilization.&quot;
Feiglin refused to meet with a gay faction within the Likud, and was quoting as stating: &quot;[A]s individuals I can’t tell them how to lead their lives and I can cooperate with them on different subjects, but as a group that tries to promote an ideology of their sexual orientation, I don’t think they have legitimacy, especially not in the Likud.&quot; On Feb. 7, 2013, Feiglin met with an Israeli gay advocacy group in Tel Aviv, and said he was no longer a homophobe. News accounts of the meeting reported Feiglin&#x27;s views: &quot;&#x27;I am in favor of you having all your human rights, but I am not prepared by the way to invalidate the special value of the classic family&#x27;, he said and made it clear that he still opposed gay marriage and same-sex parenting. &#x27;Every child in the world has a right to a mother and father. It has nothing to do with religion, but with my basic perception of the good of the child&#x27;, he said.&quot;

After his election to the Knesset, Moshe Feiglin met with homosexual groups. Although he does not identify with their lifestyle choices, he told them, he supports their rights as individuals and will fight to ensure that those rights are upheld.

When asked by a lesbian supporter if he would support her running in the primaries for the Zehut party, Feiglin was enthusiastically positive about it.

===Women===

During his 2013 campaign, Feiglin reiterated his view that women&#x27;s role in Israeli society should be based on Jewish Biblical principles. In response to a question about feminism, Feiglin was quoted as saying: &quot;&#x27;Tel Aviv has become a city that has erased masculinity and where being a man is considered a sickness&#x27;, and added that feminism has destroyed family values, something essential to Judaism. ... Pressed further, he stated that &#x27;the man is the family, while the woman is the home [literally &quot;house&quot;]&#x27;, and that in our current culture, we are forgetting &#x27;what it means to be a man&#x27;.&quot;

When the Jerusalem city government voted to permit sex-segregated public buses, according to the wishes of some ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) Jews, Feiglin supported the action: &quot;I see discrimination against women as despicable. But it is unreasonable to force an ultra-Orthodox bus company to institute mixed seating on its buses against the wishes of its customers.&quot; Feiglin also opposes the Israeli army&#x27;s decision to allow women into combat units.

=== Christians and Christianity===

Feiglin has criticized some Christian supporters of Israel, such as Glenn Beck, and challenged the sincerity of Christians who have defended Israel, as well as Israeli Jews who supported Beck. &quot;Glenn Beck doesn&#x27;t back the Jewish mission. What drives him is the Christian mission. I have no problem doing business with him, but he has to respect me when he comes here just like I don&#x27;t try to force my identity on him when I come to him. Jews like it when Goyim finally smile at them, but sometimes, a smile is more dangerous than a scowl, and this is one of those occasions&quot;, Feiglin said. Feiglin also said he had a &quot;deep problem&quot; with Efrat Chief Rabbi Shlomo Riskin participating as a featured speaker at a Christian prayer rally Glenn Beck organized at the Caesarea Amphitheater in Israel. Danny Danon responded to Feiglin, saying: &quot;Israel has too many real foes, and very few genuine friends like Glenn Beck. I cannot understand the urge to reject his friendship with pseudo-theological argumentation... Rejecting friendship is not a sign of national pride, but a proof of very low self-confidence.&quot;

===Petition by &quot;Scholars for Israel and Palestine&quot;===
In December 2014, a group of academics who are part of the anti-BDS movement and members of The Third Narrative, a Labor Zionist organization, have called on the U.S. and E.U. to impose sanctions on Feiglin and three other Israelis &quot;who lead efforts to insure permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and to annex all or parts of it unilaterally in violation of international law&quot;. These academics, calling themselves Scholars for Israel and Palestine (SIP) and claiming to be &quot;pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace&quot;, are asking the U.S. and EU to freeze Feiglin&#x27;s foreign assets and impose visa restrictions. One of the signatories was quoted in Haaretz as saying the four leaders were chosen because they &quot;were particularly dismissive of Secretary of State Kerry&#x27;s peace-making efforts, and explicitly call for and work towards the formal annexation of the West Bank or part of it, and thereby push Israel in the direction of violating international law. They are the ones who cross particularly sharp red lines.&quot; The group of mainly Jewish academics blasted Feiglin for his &quot;straightforward and undisguised extremism&quot; and &quot;annexationist&quot; agenda.

===Comments following the 2020 Beirut explosion===

Celebrating the 2020 Beirut explosions, which killed at least 220 people and injured thousands more, Feiglin referred to the explosion as &quot;a spectacular pyrotechnics show&quot;, and wrote:

You don’t actually believe this was some disorganized fuel depot, right? You do realize that this inferno was supposed to land on us as a rain of rockets? [...] Today is Tu B&#x27;Av, a day of joy, and a true and huge thank you to G-d and all the geniuses and heroes really (!) who organized for us this wonderful celebration in honor of the day of love.

&quot;The Times of Israel&quot; reported that the post was subsequently removed by Facebook. Explaining the removal, Facebook stated: “The post was removed because its content mocks the victims, which goes against our policy.&quot; Feiglin confirmed the removal of his post via his official Facebook account, claiming to &quot;stand behind every word&quot;

=== Comments during the Gaza war ===
Haaretz reported that while being interviewed by Channel 12 about the Gaza war in June 2024, Feiglin quoted Adolf Hitler stating that Israelis &quot;cannot live in this land if one Islamo-Nazi remains in Gaza.&quot; He continued stating that he wanted to &quot;turn Gaza Hebrew&quot; as Jews were &quot;not guests in our own land; it is entirely ours.&quot;

<doc id="531233" wikidata="Q3400373" url="?curid=531233" title="A55 road">
<text>The A55, also known as the North Wales Expressway (), is a major road in Wales and England, connecting Cheshire and North Wales. The vast majority of its length from Chester to Holyhead is a dual carriageway primary route, with the exception of the Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait and several short sections where there are gaps in between the two carriageways. All junctions are grade separated apart from a roundabout east of Penmaenmawr and another nearby in Llanfairfechan. Initially, the road ran from Chester to Bangor. In 2001, it was extended across Anglesey to the ferry port of Holyhead parallel to the A5. The road improvements have been part funded with European money, under the Trans-European Networks programme, as the route is designated part of Euroroute E22 (Holyhead – Leeds – Amsterdam – Hamburg – Malmö – Riga – Moscow – Perm – Ekaterinburg – Ishim).

== Route ==

===The Chester southerly bypass===
The A55 begins at junction 12 of the M53, the southern end of the motorway, near Chester. It is known as the Chester southerly bypass between J39 Christleton and J36a Broughton. The A55 crosses the River Dee and the border into Wales, passing close to Broughton, Flintshire, and passing north of Buckley, Penyffordd and Northop. There is a major climb between Broughton and Dobshill (Junctions 36a Broughton to 35 Dobshill) though with no crawler lane. Junction 34/33b is point at which the A494 converges and then diverges with the A55. The road briefly has a three-lane section as westbound traffic from Queensferry can leave towards Mold. In the eastbound direction another short three-lane section allows vehicles to join the A494 or exit onto the A55 to Chester. Traffic taking the A55 into England must negotiate a tight 270 degree speed-limited single lane curve to climb up and over the A55/A494 at Ewloe loops. Plans to upgrade the A494 between this junction at Ewloe and Queensferry were rejected by the Welsh Government on 26 March 2008 due to their scale.

=== Ewloe to Colwyn Bay ===

From Ewloe, the road is relatively flat until after Northop when it climbs up onto the flanks of Halkyn Mountain range, passing to the southwest of Holywell with major climbs between Northop and Halkyn (Junctions 33 and 32b) and Halkyn and Holywell Summit (Junctions 32 and 31). This section of road is notorious for poor weather conditions including fog, ice and snow in winter months. In fine weather, however there are extensive views over the River Dee estuary to the Wirral Peninsula, Liverpool and beyond. The highest part of the road is in the vicinity of Brynford at around 790 feet (240 m). The steep descent towards St Asaph is down the new Rhuallt Hill (Junctions 29 to 28), which also provides the first views of the mountains of Snowdonia in the far distance. There is a crawler lane on Rhuallt Hill for eastbound traffic. The road bypasses St Asaph to the north, and runs past Bodelwyddan and Abergele to reach the North Wales coast at Pensarn (Junction 23A). From here onwards to Bangor, the route is close to the North Wales Coast railway.

=== Colwyn Bay Bypass ===
Two sections between (Junction 23) Llanddulas to (Junction 17) Conwy are assigned 70 mph (110 km/h) speed limits because they are actually special roads. This is because these sections were built under legislation for building motorways but they were never declared as motorways. Legally it means these two stretches of the A55 are neither part of the national UK motorway network nor trunk roads. As such, the national speed limit does not apply so 70 mph (110 km/h) signs (the maximum speed permitted on UK roads) are used instead. Unlike other sections of the A55 that have National Speed Limit (NSL) signage and are accessible to all motor vehicles, motorway restrictions are enforced on these two stretches of road (therefore no pedestrians, learner drivers, &quot;etc.&quot;)

A 50 mph (80 km/h) limit remains in force through the Colwyn Bay bypass (Old Colwyn to Mochdre). The restriction was imposed for several reasons. First as a safety precaution because the slip-roads on this stretch are unusually short due to the road&#x27;s design. Part of it was built on a narrow swathe of land through the town that was once the North Wales coast railway; Colwyn Bay railway station had to be rebuilt and the track bed realigned to complete the underpass as the road used the former railway goods yard which was relocated to Llandudno Junction. The former four-track railway was reduced to two more northerly tracks to make space for the road. Secondly, the reduced speed limit was intended to reduce road noise for residents. However, since the completion of the Colwyn Bay bypass, the lower speed limit has been an unpopular decision with drivers.

=== Conwy Tunnel ===

The crossing of the estuary of the River Conwy is by means of an immersed tube tunnel, the first of its kind constructed in the United Kingdom. At 1060m, the tunnel is the longest road tunnel in Wales.

The decision to construct an immersed tube tunnel bypass followed an extensive public consultation, named the Collcon Feasibility Study. This ruled out another bridge by the castle on aesthetic grounds, since it would have damaged the view of the world heritage site Conwy Castle, and the two bridges by Robert Stephenson and Thomas Telford. Another alternative bridge crossing was proposed at Deganwy, but this too was ruled out for aesthetic reasons. An inland alternative with heavy grades which would have passed over Bwlch y Ddeufaen pass at , following the old Roman road, was also worked up but rejected for cost and utility reasons as it would have required a very long crawler lane.

The tunnel was constructed by a Costain/Tarmac Construction joint venture, as pre-formed concrete sections, and then floated into position over a pre-prepared trench in the bed of the estuary. The 3 million tonnes of silt and mud extracted to create the trench in which the tunnel sections sat, were vacuumed to one side of the construction site, as to let them drift down river would have harmed the large mussel fishing beds downstream. The silt was deposited upstream of the bridge at Conwy which created a large new area of low-lying land which was subsequently given to the RSPB for a wildlife preserve. The casting basin for the tunnel sections was later converted into a new marina in the lower estuary. Because of the valuable fishery in the river and also because of the history of heavy metal mining in the catchment of the river, extensive ecological assessments were made both prior to the construction of the tunnel and subsequently. These studies finally concluded that no significant environmental damage had been caused.

After five years of construction, the tunnel was opened in October 1991 by Queen Elizabeth II, the tunnel initially had an advisory speed limit, but this was dropped in 2007 as accidents were rare in the tunnels.

=== Penmaenbach and Pen-y-clip tunnels ===

Leaving Conwy in a westerly direction, the construction of this section has involved major civil engineering works because it crosses two major headlands: Penmaenbach Point and Penmaenan Point. Work has involved the cutting of several hard rock tunnels beneath the sea cliffs.

The first to be built in 1932 was the Penmaenbach Tunnel which carried motor traffic to Penmaenmawr. Two smaller tunnels through Penmaenan Point, opened 1935, carried the road on to Llanfairfechan. This new route, carrying traffic in both directions, relieved the original coach road built by Telford in the early 19th century. Cut into the cliffs by hand, this narrow, winding route hugged the contours around both steep headlands. Telford&#x27;s route has now been converted into a cycleway across Penmaenbach and Penmaenan Points. Originally at the western end (Llanfairfechan) of the modern Pen-y-Clip tunnel, access was only allowed in an easterly direction because travelling the other way would mean heading the wrong way up the eastbound carriageway. However, in 2009 a purpose-built bridge – over the westbound carriageway – was constructed to allow unrestricted access to cyclists and walkers.

The 1930s alignment was used until a new two-lane Penmaenbach Tunnel opened in 1989 to carry westbound traffic. Eastbound traffic would now travel through the 1932 Penmaenbach Tunnel using both its original lanes. Four years later, work to build the Pen-y-clip tunnel was completed. Like at Penmaenbach it carried westbound traffic while the original road carried vehicles in the opposite direction. Both new routes were subject to an advisory 50 mph speed limit until these were lifted in 2007 as there had been few accidents.

However traffic travelling eastbound on the 1930s cliff-hugging route still faced speed restrictions at both tunnel locations. For instance the eastbound carriageway at Penmaenbach is subject to a 30 mph (50 km/h) speed limit due to sharp curves and double white lines nominally preclude lane changing. Plans to rectify the awkward alignment by building another tunnel parallel to the current westbound tunnel (as originally intended when the westbound tunnel was proposed) have been discussed for several years. The work in late-2007 at Penmaenbach eastbound has seen the erection of gantries to close lanes when bidirectional working is in place. New bridges over the railway tunnel entrances at each end were added and a footbridge over the railway at the eastern end to accommodate the cycleway.

=== Penmaenmawr to Anglesey ===

Some sections of the rest of the route are of lower standard than that of those further east. Some traffic leaves for major holiday destinations such as Caernarfon or the Llŷn Peninsula, though much continues on to the port of Holyhead. As such part of the route is not classed as clearway and has two at grade junctions (roundabouts), Penmaenmawr (Junction 16) and Llanfairfechan (Junction 15). The Bangor bypass, in which the road previously terminated and became the A5 regains high standards and is such through the Anglesey section, bar the Britannia Bridge, which is a single carriageway deck above the North Wales Coast railway over the Menai Strait. In 2007 the Welsh Assembly Government undertook a consultation to determine which of four options would be preferred for another crossing. This section intersects with the A487 towards Caernarfon, and the west coast of North Wales.

=== Anglesey ===

The final section of the A55 to be constructed was the Anglesey section. This 20 mile (32 km) section from the end of the Llanfairpwll bypass to Holyhead Harbour was constructed as Private Finance Initiative scheme where the builders, a Carillion / John Laing joint venture, earn a shadow toll based on usage and lane availability. They also have to maintain the road for the extended period of their shadow toll agreement. When travelling eastbound along this section there are fine views of Snowdonia. The approach to Holyhead required major work with a new section over the sea paralleling the Stanley Embankment that carries the original A5 and the North Wales Coast railway.

==Improvements underway==
Work started in early 2017 on the upgrading of the 1960s built substandard section of dual carriageway west of Abergwyngregyn from Tai&#x27;r Meibion towards Tan-y-lon, which is a relatively narrow section of dual carriageway and prone to flooding.
After a pause, work restarted on the scheme (now known as the Abergwyngregyn-Tai&#x27;r Meibion scheme) in 2021 and encompassing some 2.2 km of the A55. It involves constructing a new road to the north of the dual carriageway for general use including cycleway and farm access. This allowed the closure of 8 central reservation gaps used by slow moving agricultural vehicles which caused safety concerns with the volume and speed of traffic on the dual carriageway. The work was well underway in September 2021 and due to open fully in 2022.

==Planned improvements==
Plans are also in their final stages to grade separate the two roundabouts at Penmaenmawr and Llanfairfechan planned to be completed by 2022. A Public Inquiry was due to be held on 21/9/21 in Llandudno Junction concerning issues over the side roads.
The two roundabout improvements will now be treated separately and the full plans can be seen on the A55 microsite.
In June 2021 the Welsh Government decided to review all road schemes whilst looking at public transport alternatives.
In September 2021 the Welsh Government announced an expansion of their plans for the North Wales Metro that may impact this road scheme. In particular longer-term plans to reopen old rail routes from Bangor to Amlwch and Bangor to West Wales (presumably a link to Cambrian Coast railway and possibly onwards from Aberystwyth to Carmarthen) may impact cash available for road schemes.
The Junction 16 scheme involves creating a new grade separated junction close to the Penmaenbach Tunnel with a single overbridge allowing access for all directions. This will replace the limited access junction 16A there for Dwygyfylchi. The existing junction 16 roundabout would be replaced by a limited access junction (westbound off/westbound on) as it is a difficult location close to the North Wales coast railway and cycle route and partly on a railway bridge. A new local road would run from the new Dwygyfylchi interchange to the existing roundabout passing around the rear of the Penguin Cafe/truckstop.
The Llanfairfechan junction 15 grade separation is much easier to achieve and will be completed on site as a grade separated junction with a single overbridge allowing access/exit for all possible directions.

In November 2012, the Welsh Government published two more detailed studies looking at options to improve transport in the North East Wales and the A55 / A494 areas. Possible changes to be considered further include
*applying managed motorway concepts
*providing hard shoulders
*providing crawler lanes at key points 
*redesigning and improving slip roads.

==History==
The A55 partly follows the alignment of the Roman road from Chester (Deva) to Caernarfon (Segontium), particularly from Junction 31 to 30 and Junction 13 to 12. Between Chester and Holywell the alignment of this road is uncertain and between St. Asaph and Abergwyngregyn, the Roman road followed an inland route, via Canovium Roman Fort at Caerhun, avoiding the difficulties of the crossing of the Conwy estuary and the cliffs at Penmaenbach and Pen-y-Clip.

===A55 opening dates of major improvements===
====1930s====
*Unknown date pre1832 Ewloe to Northop avoiding Northop Hall (shown of OS surveyor&#x27;s 1832 hand-drawn survey map in Flintshire Archives)
*1931 or 1932 Northop Bypass 
*Summer 1932 Holywell Bypass
*Unknown date 1930s? St. Asaph to Rhuallt dual carriageway and roundabouts
*Unknown date 1930s? Short section of &#x27;experimental&#x27; concrete road west of St Asaph
*1932 Penmaenbach Tunnel
*1935 Pen-y-Clip Tunnels
*Post 1938 Vicar&#x27;s Cross: A41/A51 interchange. (Directly over the site of Vicar&#x27;s Cross, a mansion in occupation 1938 – Folliott family-this only became the A55 on completion of the Chester southerly bypass in 1976).

====1950s====
*1958 Conwy new bridge avoiding Telford&#x27;s suspension bridge opened 13 December 1958. This also included a one way system through Conwy with a new route for eastbound traffic around the town&#x27;s north wall, eliminating a traffic lights at the town&#x27;s narrow north gate. Originally it had been intended to go along the quay to the new bridge but this would have destroyed the harbour fishing industry.

<text>Rotational spectroscopy is concerned with the measurement of the energies of transitions between quantized rotational states of molecules in the gas phase. The rotational spectrum (power spectral density vs. rotational frequency) of polar molecules can be measured in absorption or emission by microwave spectroscopy or by far infrared spectroscopy. The rotational spectra of non-polar molecules cannot be observed by those methods, but can be observed and measured by Raman spectroscopy. Rotational spectroscopy is sometimes referred to as &quot;pure&quot; rotational spectroscopy to distinguish it from rotational-vibrational spectroscopy where changes in rotational energy occur together with changes in vibrational energy, and also from ro-vibronic spectroscopy (or just vibronic spectroscopy) where rotational, vibrational and electronic energy changes occur simultaneously.

For rotational spectroscopy, molecules are classified according to symmetry into spherical tops, linear molecules, and symmetric tops; analytical expressions can be derived for the rotational energy terms of these molecules. Analytical expressions can be derived for the fourth category, asymmetric top, for rotational levels up to J=3, but higher energy levels need to be determined using numerical methods. The rotational energies are derived theoretically by considering the molecules to be rigid rotors and then applying extra terms to account for centrifugal distortion, fine structure, hyperfine structure and Coriolis coupling. Fitting the spectra to the theoretical expressions gives numerical values of the angular moments of inertia from which very precise values of molecular bond lengths and angles can be derived in favorable cases. In the presence of an electrostatic field there is Stark splitting which allows molecular electric dipole moments to be determined.

An important application of rotational spectroscopy is in exploration of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium using radio telescopes.

==Applications==
Rotational spectroscopy has primarily been used to investigate fundamental aspects of molecular physics. It is a uniquely precise tool for the determination of molecular structure in gas-phase molecules. It can be used to establish barriers to internal rotation such as that associated with the rotation of the group relative to the group in chlorotoluene (). When fine or hyperfine structure can be observed, the technique also provides information on the electronic structures of molecules. Much of current understanding of the nature of weak molecular interactions such as van der Waals, hydrogen and halogen bonds has been established through rotational spectroscopy. In connection with radio astronomy, the technique has a key role in exploration of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium. Microwave transitions are measured in the laboratory and matched
to emissions from the interstellar medium using a radio telescope. was the first stable polyatomic molecule to be identified in the interstellar medium. The measurement of chlorine monoxide is important for atmospheric chemistry. Current projects in astrochemistry involve both laboratory microwave spectroscopy and observations made using modern radiotelescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).

==Overview==
A molecule in the gas phase is free to rotate relative to a set of mutually orthogonal axes of fixed orientation in space, centered on the center of mass of the molecule. Free rotation is not possible for molecules in liquid or solid phases due to the presence of intermolecular forces. Rotation about each unique axis is associated with a set of quantized energy levels dependent on the moment of inertia about that axis and a quantum number. Thus, for linear molecules the energy levels are described by a single moment of inertia and a single quantum number, formula_1, which defines the magnitude of the rotational angular momentum.

For nonlinear molecules which are symmetric rotors (or symmetric tops - see next section), there are two moments of inertia and the energy also depends on a second rotational quantum number, formula_2, which defines the vector component of rotational angular momentum along the principal symmetry axis. Analysis of spectroscopic data with the expressions detailed below results in quantitative determination of the value(s) of the moment(s) of inertia. From these precise values of the molecular structure and dimensions may be obtained.

For a linear molecule, analysis of the rotational spectrum provides values for the rotational constant and the moment of inertia of the molecule, and, knowing the atomic masses, can be used to determine the bond length directly. For diatomic molecules this process is straightforward. For linear molecules with more than two atoms it is necessary to measure the spectra of two or more isotopologues, such as 16O12C32S and 16O12C34S. This allows a set of simultaneous equations to be set up and solved for the bond lengths). A bond length obtained in this way is slightly different from the equilibrium bond length. This is because there is zero-point energy in the vibrational ground state, to which the rotational states refer, whereas the equilibrium bond length is at the minimum in the potential energy curve. The relation between the rotational constants is given by
:formula_3

where v is a vibrational quantum number and α is a vibration-rotation interaction constant which can be calculated if the B values for two different vibrational states can be found.

For other molecules, if the spectra can be resolved and individual transitions assigned both bond lengths and bond angles can be deduced. When this is not possible, as with most asymmetric tops, all that can be done is to fit the spectra to three moments of inertia calculated from an assumed molecular structure. By varying the molecular structure the fit can be improved, giving a qualitative estimate of the structure. Isotopic substitution is invaluable when using this approach to the determination of molecular structure.

===Classification of molecular rotors===
In quantum mechanics the free rotation of a molecule is quantized, so that the rotational energy and the angular momentum can take only certain fixed values, which are related simply to the moment of inertia, formula_4, of the molecule. For any molecule, there are three moments of inertia: formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7 about three mutually orthogonal axes &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; with the origin at the center of mass of the system. The general convention, used in this article, is to define the axes such that formula_8, with axis formula_9 corresponding to the smallest moment of inertia. Some authors, however, define the formula_9 axis as the molecular rotation axis of highest order.

The particular pattern of energy levels (and, hence, of transitions in the rotational spectrum) for a molecule is determined by its symmetry. A convenient way to look at the molecules is to divide them into four different classes, based on the symmetry of their structure. These are


===Selection rules===
====Microwave and far-infrared spectra====
Transitions between rotational states can be observed in molecules with a permanent electric dipole moment. A consequence of this rule is that no microwave spectrum can be observed for centrosymmetric linear molecules such as (dinitrogen) or HCCH (ethyne), which are non-polar. Tetrahedral molecules such as (methane), which have both a zero dipole moment and isotropic polarizability, would not have a pure rotation spectrum but for the effect of centrifugal distortion; when the molecule rotates about a 3-fold symmetry axis a small dipole moment is created, allowing a weak rotation spectrum to be observed by microwave spectroscopy.

With symmetric tops, the selection rule for electric-dipole-allowed pure rotation transitions is , . Since these transitions are due to absorption (or emission) of a single photon with a spin of one, conservation of angular momentum implies that the molecular angular momentum can change by at most one unit. Moreover, the quantum number &quot;K&quot; is limited to have values between and including +&quot;J&quot; to -&quot;J&quot;.

====Raman spectra====
For Raman spectra the molecules undergo transitions in which an &quot;incident&quot; photon is absorbed and another &quot;scattered&quot; photon is emitted. The general selection rule for such a transition to be allowed is that the molecular polarizability must be anisotropic, which means that it is not the same in all directions. Polarizability is a 3-dimensional tensor that can be represented as an ellipsoid. The polarizability ellipsoid of spherical top molecules is in fact spherical so those molecules show no rotational Raman spectrum. For all other molecules both Stokes and anti-Stokes lines can be observed and they have similar intensities due to the fact that many rotational states are thermally populated. The selection rule for linear molecules is ΔJ = 0, ±2. The reason for the values ±2 is that the polarizability returns to the same value twice during a rotation. The value ΔJ = 0 does not correspond to a molecular transition but rather to Rayleigh scattering in which the incident photon merely changes direction.

The selection rule for symmetric top molecules is
: Δ&quot;K&quot; = 0
: If &quot;K&quot; = 0, then Δ&quot;J&quot; = ±2
: If &quot;K&quot; ≠ 0, then Δ&quot;J&quot; = 0, ±1, ±2

Transitions with Δ&quot;J&quot; = +1 are said to belong to the &quot;R&quot; series, whereas transitions with belong to an &quot;S&quot; series. Since Raman transitions involve two photons, it is possible for the molecular angular momentum to change by two units.

===Units===
The units used for rotational constants depend on the type of measurement. With infrared spectra in the wavenumber scale (formula_11), the unit is usually the inverse centimeter, written as cm−1, which is literally the number of waves in one centimeter, or the reciprocal of the wavelength in centimeters (formula_12). On the other hand, for microwave spectra in the frequency scale (formula_13), the unit is usually the gigahertz. The relationship between these two units is derived from the expression
:formula_14

where ν is a frequency, λ is a wavelength and &quot;c&quot; is the velocity of light. It follows that 
:formula_15

As 1 GHz = 109 Hz, the numerical conversion can be expressed as 
:formula_16

===Effect of vibration on rotation===
The population of vibrationally excited states follows a Boltzmann distribution, so low-frequency vibrational states are appreciably populated even at room temperatures. As the moment of inertia is higher when a vibration is excited, the rotational constants (&quot;B&quot;) decrease. Consequently, the rotation frequencies in each vibration state are different from each other. This can give rise to &quot;satellite&quot; lines in the rotational spectrum. An example is provided by cyanodiacetylene, H−C≡C−C≡C−C≡N.

Further, there is a fictitious force, Coriolis coupling, between the vibrational motion of the nuclei in the rotating (non-inertial) frame. However, as long as the vibrational quantum number does not change (i.e., the molecule is in only one state of vibration), the effect of vibration on rotation is not important, because the time for vibration is much shorter than the time required for rotation. The Coriolis coupling is often negligible, too, if one is interested in low vibrational and rotational quantum numbers only.

===Effect of rotation on vibrational spectra===

Historically, the theory of rotational energy levels was developed to account for observations of vibration-rotation spectra of gases in infrared spectroscopy, which was used before microwave spectroscopy had become practical. To a first approximation, the rotation and vibration can be treated as separable, so the energy of rotation is added to the energy of vibration. For example, the rotational energy levels for linear molecules (in the rigid-rotor approximation) are

:formula_17

In this approximation, the vibration-rotation wavenumbers of transitions are

:formula_18

where formula_19 and formula_20 are rotational constants for the upper and lower vibrational state respectively, while formula_21 and formula_22 are the rotational quantum numbers of the upper and lower levels. In reality, this expression has to be modified for the effects of anharmonicity of the vibrations, for centrifugal distortion and for Coriolis coupling.

For the so-called &quot;R&quot; branch of the spectrum, formula_23 so that there is simultaneous excitation of both vibration and rotation. For the &quot;P&quot; branch, formula_24 so that a quantum of rotational energy is lost while a quantum of vibrational energy is gained. The purely vibrational transition, formula_25, gives rise to the &quot;Q&quot; branch of the spectrum. Because of the thermal population of the rotational states the &quot;P&quot; branch is slightly less intense than the &quot;R&quot; branch.

Rotational constants obtained from infrared measurements are in good accord with those obtained by microwave spectroscopy, while the latter usually offers greater precision.

==Structure of rotational spectra==

===Spherical top===
Spherical top molecules have no net dipole moment. A pure rotational spectrum cannot be observed by absorption or emission spectroscopy because there is no permanent dipole moment whose rotation can be accelerated by the electric field of an incident photon. Also the polarizability is isotropic, so that pure rotational transitions cannot be observed by Raman spectroscopy either. Nevertheless, rotational constants can be obtained by ro–vibrational spectroscopy. This occurs when a molecule is polar in the vibrationally excited state. For example, the molecule methane is a spherical top but the asymmetric C-H stretching band shows rotational fine structure in the infrared spectrum, illustrated in rovibrational coupling. This spectrum is also interesting because it shows clear evidence of Coriolis coupling in the asymmetric structure of the band.

===Linear molecules===
The rigid rotor is a good starting point from which to construct a model of a rotating molecule. It is assumed that component atoms are point masses connected by rigid bonds. A linear molecule lies on a single axis and each atom moves on the surface of a sphere around the centre of mass. The two degrees of rotational freedom correspond to the spherical coordinates θ and φ which describe the direction of the molecular axis, and the quantum state is determined by two quantum numbers J and M. J defines the magnitude of the rotational angular momentum, and M its component about an axis fixed in space, such as an external electric or magnetic field. In the absence of external fields, the energy depends only on J. Under the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels, &quot;F&quot;(J), of the molecule can be expressed as,

:formula_26
where formula_27 is the rotational constant of the molecule and is related to the moment of inertia of the molecule. In a linear molecule the moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the molecular axis is unique, that is, formula_28, so 
:formula_29
For a diatomic molecule
:formula_30 
where &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 are the masses of the atoms and &quot;d&quot; is the distance between them.

Selection rules dictate that during emission or absorption the rotational quantum number has to change by unity; i.e., formula_31. Thus, the locations of the lines in a rotational spectrum will be given by

:formula_32

where formula_33 denotes the lower level and formula_34 denotes the upper level involved in the transition.

The diagram illustrates rotational transitions that obey the formula_35=1 selection rule. The dashed lines show how these transitions map onto features that can be observed experimentally. Adjacent formula_36 transitions are separated by 2&quot;B&quot; in the observed spectrum. Frequency or wavenumber units can also be used for the &quot;x&quot; axis of this plot.

====Rotational line intensities====

The probability of a transition taking place is the most important factor influencing the intensity of an observed rotational line. This probability is proportional to the population of the initial state involved in the transition. The population of a rotational state depends on two factors. The number of molecules in an excited state with quantum number &quot;J&quot;, relative to the number of molecules in the ground state, &quot;NJ&quot;/&quot;N&quot;0 is given by the Boltzmann distribution as
:formula_37, 
where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; the absolute temperature. This factor decreases as &quot;J&quot; increases. The second factor is the degeneracy of the rotational state, which is equal to . This factor increases as &quot;J&quot; increases. Combining the two factors
:formula_38 

The maximum relative intensity occurs at
:formula_39

The diagram at the right shows an intensity pattern roughly corresponding to the spectrum above it.

====Centrifugal distortion====
When a molecule rotates, the centrifugal force pulls the atoms apart. As a result, the moment of inertia of the molecule increases, thus decreasing the value of formula_27, when it is calculated using the expression for the rigid rotor. To account for this a centrifugal distortion correction term is added to the rotational energy levels of the diatomic molecule.

:formula_41

where formula_42 is the centrifugal distortion constant.

Therefore, the line positions for the rotational mode change to

:formula_43
In consequence, the spacing between lines is not constant, as in the rigid rotor approximation, but decreases with increasing rotational quantum number.

An assumption underlying these expressions is that the molecular vibration follows simple harmonic motion. In the harmonic approximation the centrifugal constant formula_42 can be derived as
:formula_45
where &quot;k&quot; is the vibrational force constant. The relationship between formula_46 and formula_42 
:formula_48
where formula_49 is the harmonic vibration frequency, follows. If anharmonicity is to be taken into account, terms in higher powers of J should be added to the expressions for the energy levels and line positions. A striking example concerns the rotational spectrum of hydrogen fluoride which was fitted to terms up to &quot;[J(J+1)]5&quot;.

====Oxygen====
The electric dipole moment of the dioxygen molecule, is zero, but the molecule is paramagnetic with two unpaired electrons so that there are magnetic-dipole allowed transitions which can be observed by microwave spectroscopy. The unit electron spin has three spatial orientations with respect to the given molecular rotational angular momentum vector, K, so that each rotational level is split into three states, J = K + 1, K, and K - 1, each J state of this so-called p-type triplet arising from a different orientation of the spin with respect to the rotational motion of the molecule. The energy difference between successive J terms in any of these triplets is about 2 cm−1 (60 GHz), with the single exception of J = 1←0 difference which is about 4 cm−1. Selection rules for magnetic dipole transitions allow transitions between successive members of the triplet (ΔJ = ±1) so that for each value of the rotational angular momentum quantum number K there are two allowed transitions. The 16O nucleus has zero nuclear spin angular momentum, so that symmetry considerations demand that K have only odd values.

===Symmetric top===
For symmetric rotors a quantum number &quot;J&quot; is associated with the total angular momentum of the molecule. For a given value of J, there is a 2&quot;J&quot;+1- fold degeneracy with the quantum number, &quot;M&quot; taking the values +&quot;J&quot; ...0 ... -&quot;J&quot;. The third quantum number, &quot;K&quot; is associated with rotation about the principal rotation axis of the molecule. In the absence of an external electrical field, the rotational energy of a symmetric top is a function of only J and K and, in the rigid rotor approximation, the energy of each rotational state is given by

:formula_50

where formula_51 and formula_52 for a &quot;prolate&quot; symmetric top molecule or formula_53 for an &quot;oblate&quot; molecule.

This gives the transition wavenumbers as

:formula_54

which is the same as in the case of a linear molecule. With a first order correction for centrifugal distortion the transition wavenumbers become
:formula_55

The term in &quot;DJK&quot; has the effect of removing degeneracy present in the rigid rotor approximation, with different &quot;K&quot; values.

===Asymmetric top===
The quantum number &quot;J&quot; refers to the total angular momentum, as before. Since there are three independent moments of inertia, there are two other independent quantum numbers to consider, but the term values for an asymmetric rotor cannot be derived in closed form. They are obtained by individual matrix diagonalization for each &quot;J&quot; value. Formulae are available for molecules whose shape approximates to that of a symmetric top.

The water molecule is an important example of an asymmetric top. It has an intense pure rotation spectrum in the far infrared region, below about 200 cm−1. For this reason far infrared spectrometers have to be freed of atmospheric water vapour either by purging with a dry gas or by evacuation. The spectrum has been analyzed in detail.

==Quadrupole splitting==
When a nucleus has a spin quantum number, &quot;I&quot;, greater than 1/2 it has a quadrupole moment. In that case, coupling of nuclear spin angular momentum with rotational angular momentum causes splitting of the rotational energy levels. If the quantum number &quot;J&quot; of a rotational level is greater than &quot;I&quot;, levels are produced; but if &quot;J&quot; is less than &quot;I&quot;, levels result. The effect is one type of hyperfine splitting. For example, with 14N () in HCN, all levels with J &gt; 0 are split into 3. The energies of the sub-levels are proportional to the nuclear quadrupole moment and a function of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;J&quot;. where , . Thus, observation of nuclear quadrupole splitting permits the magnitude of the nuclear quadrupole moment to be determined.
This is an alternative method to the use of nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy. The selection rule for rotational transitions becomes

==Stark and Zeeman effects==
In the presence of a static external electric field the degeneracy of each rotational state is partly removed, an instance of a Stark effect. For example, in linear molecules each energy level is split into components. The extent of splitting depends on the square of the electric field strength and the square of the dipole moment of the molecule. In principle this provides a means to determine the value of the molecular dipole moment with high precision. Examples include carbonyl sulfide, OCS, with . However, because the splitting depends on μ2, the orientation of the dipole must be deduced from quantum mechanical considerations.

A similar removal of degeneracy will occur when a paramagnetic molecule is placed in a magnetic field, an instance of the Zeeman effect. Most species which can be observed in the gaseous state are diamagnetic . Exceptions are odd-electron molecules such as nitric oxide, NO, nitrogen dioxide, , some chlorine oxides and the hydroxyl radical. The Zeeman effect has been observed with dioxygen, 

==Rotational Raman spectroscopy==
Molecular rotational transitions can also be observed by Raman spectroscopy. Rotational transitions are Raman-allowed for any molecule with an anisotropic polarizability which includes all molecules except for spherical tops. This means that rotational transitions of molecules with no permanent dipole moment, which cannot be observed in absorption or emission, can be observed, by scattering, in Raman spectroscopy. Very high resolution Raman spectra can be obtained by adapting a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. An example is the spectrum of . It shows the effect of nuclear spin, resulting in intensities variation of 3:1 in adjacent lines. A bond length of 109.9985 ± 0.0010 pm was deduced from the data.

==Instruments and methods==
The great majority of contemporary spectrometers use a mixture of commercially available and bespoke components which users integrate according to their particular needs. Instruments can be broadly categorised according to their general operating principles. Although rotational transitions can be found across a very broad region of the electromagnetic spectrum, fundamental physical constraints exist on the operational bandwidth of instrument components. It is often impractical and costly to switch to measurements within an entirely different frequency region. The instruments and operating principals described below are generally appropriate to microwave spectroscopy experiments conducted at frequencies between 6 and 24 GHz.

===Absorption cells and Stark modulation===
A microwave spectrometer can be most simply constructed using a source of microwave radiation, an absorption cell into which sample gas can be introduced and a detector such as a superheterodyne receiver. A spectrum can be obtained by sweeping the frequency of the source while detecting the intensity of transmitted radiation. A simple section of waveguide can serve as an absorption cell. An important variation of the technique in which an alternating current is applied across electrodes within the absorption cell results in a modulation of the frequencies of rotational transitions. This is referred to as Stark modulation and allows the use of phase-sensitive detection methods offering improved sensitivity. Absorption spectroscopy allows the study of samples that are thermodynamically stable at room temperature. The first study of the microwave spectrum of a molecule () was performed by Cleeton &amp; Williams in 1934. Subsequent experiments exploited powerful sources of microwaves such as the klystron, many of which were developed for radar during the Second World War. The number of experiments in microwave spectroscopy surged immediately after the war. By 1948, Walter Gordy was able to prepare a review of the results contained in approximately 100 research papers. Commercial versions of microwave absorption spectrometer were developed by Hewlett-Packard in the 1970s and were once widely used for fundamental research. Most research laboratories now exploit either Balle-Flygare or chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectrometers.

===Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy===
The theoretical framework underpinning FTMW spectroscopy is analogous to that used to describe FT-NMR spectroscopy. The behaviour of the evolving system is described by optical Bloch equations. First, a short (typically 0-3 microsecond duration) microwave pulse is introduced on resonance with a rotational transition. Those molecules that absorb the energy from this pulse are induced to rotate coherently in phase with the incident radiation. De-activation of the polarisation pulse is followed by microwave emission that accompanies decoherence of the molecular ensemble. This free induction decay occurs on a timescale of 1-100 microseconds depending on instrument settings. Following pioneering work by Dicke and co-workers in the 1950s, the first FTMW spectrometer was constructed by Ekkers and Flygare in 1975.

====Balle–Flygare FTMW spectrometer====
Balle, Campbell, Keenan and Flygare demonstrated that the FTMW technique can be applied within a &quot;free space cell&quot; comprising an evacuated chamber containing a Fabry-Perot cavity. This technique allows a sample to be probed only milliseconds after it undergoes rapid cooling to only a few kelvins in the throat of an expanding gas jet. This was a revolutionary development because (i) cooling molecules to low temperatures concentrates the available population in the lowest rotational energy levels. Coupled with benefits conferred by the use of a Fabry-Perot cavity, this brought a great enhancement in the sensitivity and resolution of spectrometers along with a reduction in the complexity of observed spectra; (ii) it became possible to isolate and study molecules that are very weakly bound because there is insufficient energy available for them to undergo fragmentation or chemical reaction at such low temperatures. William Klemperer was a pioneer in using this instrument for the exploration of weakly bound interactions. While the Fabry-Perot cavity of a Balle-Flygare FTMW spectrometer can typically be tuned into resonance at any frequency between 6 and 18 GHz, the bandwidth of individual measurements is restricted to about 1 MHz. An animation illustrates the operation of this instrument which is currently the most widely used tool for microwave spectroscopy.

====Chirped-Pulse FTMW spectrometer====
Noting that digitisers and related electronics technology had significantly progressed since the inception of FTMW spectroscopy, B.H. Pate at the University of Virginia designed a spectrometer which retains many advantages of the Balle-Flygare FT-MW spectrometer while innovating in (i) the use of a high speed (&gt;4 GS/s) arbitrary waveform generator to generate a &quot;chirped&quot; microwave polarisation pulse that sweeps up to 12 GHz in frequency in less than a microsecond and (ii) the use of a high speed (&gt;40 GS/s) oscilloscope to digitise and Fourier transform the molecular free induction decay. The result is an instrument that allows the study of weakly bound molecules but which is able to exploit a measurement bandwidth (12 GHz) that is greatly enhanced compared with the Balle-Flygare FTMW spectrometer. Modified versions of the original CP-FTMW spectrometer have been constructed by a number of groups in the United States, Canada and Europe. The instrument offers a broadband capability that is highly complementary to the high sensitivity and resolution offered by the Balle-Flygare design.

<text>The A52 is a major road in the East Midlands, England. It runs east from a junction with the A53 at Newcastle-under-Lyme near Stoke-on-Trent via Ashbourne, Derby, Stapleford, Nottingham, West Bridgford, Bingham, Grantham, Boston and Skegness to the east Lincolnshire coast at Mablethorpe. It is approximately long.

==Route length==
According to the AA, Newcastle-under-Lyme to Derby takes 56 minutes, Derby to Boston takes 1 hour and 40 minutes (100 minutes), and Boston to Mablethorpe takes 1 hour and 2 minutes (62 minutes), taking 3 hours and 38 minutes (218 minutes) to travel the whole distance.

==History==
===Brian Clough Way===
The mainly dual-carriageway stretch between The Pentagon Island in Derby and the Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre in Nottingham was named Brian Clough Way in 2005 to honour the late Derby County and Nottingham Forest football manager Brian Clough.

===Nantwich, Chesire===
Historically the A52 used to start at Nantwich in Cheshire, but was renumbered to become the A500, the A531, and the B5500—the A500 sections later becoming unclassified.

==Route==

===Newcastle-under-Lyme – Derby===
The road starts as &quot;Ryecroft&quot; from the roundabout with the A34 and B5367. It is dual carriageway until the next roundabout, forming part of the Newcastle ring road, with the A527 and A53. It passes the leisure centre on the right, then veers right at a junction with the B5045 (which continues on the main road), where it enters the City of Stoke-on-Trent. As &quot;Hartshill Road&quot;, it passes the Royal Stoke University Hospital and enters the town of Stoke-upon-Trent. It takes two possible routes around the town centre, meeting the A500 D Road. It goes under the West Coast Main Line near Stoke-on-Trent railway station and becomes &quot;Leek Road&quot;, passing one campus (Leek Road) of Staffordshire University. It meets the A50 at a roundabout at Joiner&#x27;s Square near Hanley. It meets the A5008 and A5009 (for Leek) at crossroads, where it turns right. There is a junction with the A5272 (for Berry Hill). As &quot;Werrington Road&quot; in Bucknall it passes the former Mitchell High School and enters Staffordshire and the borough of the Staffordshire Moorlands. It passes through Ash Bank and Staffordshire, then meets the A520 (for Leek) at crossroads, then overlaps the A522 (for Cheadle). It passes through the villages of Kingsley and then Froghall where it crosses over the Churnet Valley Railway and Cauldon Canal, before meeting the A521 and B5053 (for Ipstones). It passes through Whiston and meets the B5417 (for Oakamoor). It meets the A523 (for Leek) and passes through Swinscoe, then briefly enters East Staffordshire.

The road enters Derbyshire and the Derbyshire Dales district where it crosses the River Dove over the Hanging Bridge near the junction with the B5032 at Mayfield close to the &quot;Queens Arms Hotel&quot;. The £3 million Ashbourne Relief Road opened in October 1994. There is a roundabout for the exit to Ashbourne and one with the A515. The road climbs up the side of the Dove Valley, and there is a central overtaking/crawler lane. The roundabout with the eastern exit to Ashbourne is near an old airfield which is now an industrial estate. The area around the next section of road to Derby has links with Bonnie Prince Charlie. It passes through Brailsford and the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; and at Kirk Langley, there is a junction with the B5020 for Mickleover.

It passes Mackworth, the &quot;Munday Arms&quot; and &quot;Mackworth Hotel&quot;, with part of the Mackworth Estate to the south and Markeaton Park. Entering Derby as &quot;Ashbourne Road&quot;, it meets the busy A38 at a roundabout, and Esso &quot;Mackworth Service Station&quot;. It passes the &quot;Shell Friargate&quot; garage on the left which has now been closed down. From here to the dual-carriageway is a popular pub crawl, with many student residences close by for the University of Derby, such as St Christopher&#x27;s Court. Close by to the north is the new Markeaton campus of the university. The road splits into east and west sections, passing St John the Evangelist church on the left, with the easterly section being &quot;Agard Street&quot; and the westerly section being &quot;Friargate&quot;. From the traffic lights at the eastern end of both, the road becomes &quot;Ford Street&quot;, passing the Friargate Studios.

===Derby – Nottingham===

It overlaps the £3.5 million (£ as of ), A601 Derby Inner Ring Road, which is called &quot;St Alkmunds Way&quot; and was opened on 30 July 1972. It is used by 70,000 motorists daily as they pass under the 2007 footbridge towards Pentagon Island. From the Radio Derby building (to the west of the city centre) to Nottingham, it is dual-carriageway. It crosses the River Derwent, the A601 leaves to the south, and it passes under the Midland Main Line as &quot;Eastgate&quot;. There is the &quot;Pentagon Island&quot; Grade Separated Junction (GSJ) with the A61 near Chaddesden. The westbound-direction is not grade-separated and meets the roundabout, thus causing many severe queues at rush-hour. Near Spondon, there is a large GSJ with the A5111 Derby outer ring road. The £4.6 million (£ as of ), Borrowash Bypass Extension opened on 29 May 1980 as well the £6 million (£ as of ), Nottingham Road Diversion, from the Pentagon Island to &quot;Raynesway&quot;. Both sections totalled . before Borrowash, it enters the Borough of Erewash.

Further east, it is the main east–west route from Derby to Nottingham, connecting the two cities via the busy junction 25 of the M1 at Sandiacre. The £250,000 Borrowash Bypass opened in 1957, although the bridge at Ockbrook opened in 1969, from a roundabout with the A6005 to Hopwell Firs. The former route is partly the A6005. The £2 million (£ as of ), Sandiacre Stapleford Bypass opened in December 1964, being built two years before junction 25 of the M1 had been opened although all the bridges and roundabout were part of the bypass. It was the first major road project opened by the 1964 Labour government. The former route is the B5010. It crosses the Nottingham section of the Midland Main Line, and the River Erewash and Erewash Canal, entering Nottinghamshire and the Borough of Broxtowe.

&quot;Bardill&#x27;s Island&quot; roundabout provides a junction with &quot;Toton Lane&quot; (B6003), which connects to both Stapleford and the Toton Lane Park &amp; Ride site that is linked to central Nottingham by the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) tramway. The roundabout is also near the George Spencer Academy and the garden centre after which it is named. The A52 then passes through Bramcote at the roundabout with the A6007 next to Bramcote leisure centre and becomes a three-lane dual carriageway, however the left lane is a bus lane. There is a right-turn at traffic lights for &quot;Wollaton Road&quot; (B6006) for Beeston near the &quot;Nurseryman&quot; pub.

It enters the City of Nottingham at the A6464 &quot;Priory&quot; roundabout (&quot;Woodside Road&quot; leading to the A6005) in Lenton Abbey with the &quot;Shell Priory &quot; garage on the right, and the &quot;Wollaton Miller and Carter Steakhouse&quot; on the left on &quot;Wollaton Vale&quot; road. To the left is Wollaton Park and nearby to the south is the University of Nottingham. The junction at the Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre with the A6514 &quot;Middleton Boulevard&quot; was originally a roundabout, but became a GSJ, costing £3.7 million in late 1983. It then turns right and follows Clifton Boulevard (Ring Road) (after just under 2 miles crossing Clifton Bridge over the River Trent) as far as the A60 roundabout, where it continues East towards the A1. The former route through Nottingham is now the A6200, then down &quot;Angel Row&quot;, &quot;Wheeler Gate&quot;, &quot;Lister Gate&quot; then through what is now the Broadmarsh Centre and past the railway station on &quot;Carrington Street&quot;, through The Meadows as &quot;Arkwright Street&quot; to a point near the A60/A6011 junction, over Trent Bridge and along the current A6520 &quot;Radcliffe Road&quot;. South of here it follows the former A614 as &quot;Clifton Boulevard&quot;. There is a junction for &quot;Abbey Street&quot; (A6005 – former A453) which was originally a much smaller temporary flyover, but was improved in June 1990 at a cost of £5.5 million, which is where the former A614 terminated. It crosses the Beeston Canal and Nottingham – Derby/Loughborough railway line and follows the Clifton Boulevard around the south of Nottingham. It overlaps the A453, then the A453 exits for the M1 and Clifton near the Texaco &quot;Silverdale Service Station&quot; and The Becket School.
One of the bridges over the Trent at Clifton Bridge includes a section of the former B680 (which followed the route into Nottingham now used by the A453). The 275 ft east bridge opened in 1958, being officially opened by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The bridge was widened, with the west bridge, to dual-carriageway as the A614 as part of a £3.2 million section, opening in 1972. This was the completion of the dual-carriageway Nottingham ring-road. It enters the borough of Rushcliffe where it crosses the former Great Central Main Line and meets the A60 (for Ruddington and the Nottingham South Premier Inn), then the A606 at busy roundabouts. This section from the A606 roundabout, near the Wheatcroft Garden Centre, to the Dunkirk junction (current A6005, then the A453) – the Nottingham Ring Road – was opened in 1963 as mostly single carriageway. The section from Clifton Bridge to the A60 roundabout was dualled in December 1968. The £6 million section from Gamston to Lings Bar opened in September 1981 as &quot;Gamston Lings Bar Road&quot;. It passes close to Tollerton Airfield and a large Morrisons (former Safeway), and crosses the Grantham Canal meeting the former route (A6011) at a busy roundabout near the &quot;Bridge&quot; pub. The section from the QMC to the A606 &quot;Wheatcroft Island&quot; roundabout used to be the A614 until the Gamston section was opened. The former route of the A52 into Nottingham is now the A6200 and A6011.

===Nottingham – Grantham===

Heading east as &quot;Radcliffe Road&quot; with Bassingfield to the right, the £25,000 (£ as of ), dual-carriageway section from Holme House built in 1956 finishes at the start of the Radcliffe on Trent bypass as &quot;Grantham Road&quot;. There is the BP &quot;Pierrepont Filling Station&quot; just before the turn-off for Radcliffe on Trent. This stretch has SPECS cameras along it. Close by is the Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre. The road goes past Upper Saxondale, then meets the A46 at the large Saxondale roundabout, which has the &quot;Shell Saxondale&quot; garage. The road runs roughly parallel with the Nottingham-Grantham railway between Radcliffe on Trent and Grantham. From the A46, the road heads east past Bingham on the £2.6 million (£ as of ), Bingham bypass opened in December 1986. The road passes the Murco &quot;Kings Service Station&quot; on the left. There is a left turn for Scarrington, then it passes a HM Prison Whatton at Whatton-in-the Vale, near to where it crosses the River Smite.
It passes the &quot;Vale of Belvoir&quot; hotel, and after Elton where it passes the &quot;Manor Arms&quot;, it enters Leicestershire, the district of Melton, and the Vale of Belvoir at the start of the Bottesford bypass, which opened in February 1989 with an extremely wide concrete £3 million (£ as of ), two-way road.

It passes by Muston and enters Lincolnshire and South Kesteven at the crossing of Sewstern Lane (Viking Way) next to the popular &quot;Muston Gap&quot;, passing through Sedgebrook. Belvoir Castle can be seen in the distance. The road climbs the steep &quot;Mill Hill&quot; near Barrowby, crosses the A1 and becomes &quot;Barrowby Road&quot;. The section of road from Radcliffe on Trent to Grantham was planned to become a dual-carriageway in the 1990s, but there are no plans at present.

It meets a roundabout with &quot;Barrowby Gate&quot;, next to the &quot;Muddle Go Nowhere&quot;, passing through Green Hill. At the bottom of &quot;Barrowby Road&quot; is a low-height railway bridge, which in 2005 was the most-hit railway bridge in the UK. Until only recently this busy trunk road was part of the High Street in Grantham; now it is diverted alongside the East Coast Main Line on &quot;Sankt Augustin Way&quot;, which is also the A607.
At the start of &quot;Sankt Augustin Way&quot;, the road passes an Asda on the left. It meets &quot;Dysart Road&quot; at traffic lights and turns left at a one way system onto &quot;Wharf Road&quot;, passing a large Morrisons store and &quot;Churchills&quot; pub, then turning right at traffic lights onto &quot;London Road&quot;, passing Sainsburys and the &quot;Reindeer Inn&quot;. The most sensible route around Grantham is to follow the A1 from Barrowby and take the A607 exit into Grantham, although there is a low bridge (13&#x27;) on &quot;Springfield Road&quot; (another part of the A607), which was the UK&#x27;s most-hit bridge in 2006.

There have been plans for an A52 bypass south of Grantham, which have many cycle-riding objectors. South of the town, it meets the B1174 at traffic lights near the &quot;Spotted Cow&quot;, with the Total &quot;St Leonards Service Station&quot; on the left and Pizza Hut and McDonald&#x27;s on the right.

===Grantham – Boston===
This section of road is known locally as &quot;The Ramper&quot;, a name from the turnpike era.
From Grantham, which was the A52&#x27;s original eastern end, the road continues as &quot;Bridge End Road&quot; passing the &quot;White Lion&quot;, then &quot;Somerby Hill&quot; eastwards, passing the &quot;Shell Somerby Hill Service Station&quot; on the left, rising up the valley of the River Witham to reach the ancient Ermine Street Roman road at the B6403/B1176 roundabout, which it follows for about . Ermine Street continues as the B6403 northwards at Cold Harbour. Traffic for Skegness may want to take the A153 instead (via the Sleaford bypass), as from Boston – Wainfleet, the traffic slows down. It follows &quot;High Dike&quot;, and there is a left turn for Welby and a right turn for Ropsley.
There is a crossroads with the left for Oasby. There is a right turn for Braceby, then just before a right turn for Haceby, the road enters North Kesteven. There are turnings for Dembleby and Newton and passes through Scott Willoughby. It meets the A15 at the Threekingham Bar roundabout near Osbournby becoming &quot;Holland Road&quot;, and passes through Threekingham and crosses &quot;Mareham Lane&quot; (a Roman road), with the &quot;Holland Road Service Station&quot; on the right, where it re-enters South Kesteven. From here to the South-Forty Foot Drain (about ), the road lies on the border of the districts of North Kesteven and South Kesteven. There are crossroads with the B1394 (for Swaton and Horbling), and the road meets the B1177 from nearby Billingborough at Bridge End, becoming &quot;Bridge End Causeway&quot;.
At &quot;Donington High Bridge&quot;, it enters the district of South Holland next to the &quot;Sloop Inn&quot;. It passes over the Sleaford-Spalding railway and at Donington there is a roundabout with the A152 (the former name of the A52 east of Grantham). It follows a bypass, which opened in the early 1990s, to the north becoming &quot;Bicker Road&quot; and there is a left turn for Northorpe. It enters the borough of Boston just before the bypass to the south of Bicker, which opened in the early 1990s, where it meets the B1181 and becomes &quot;Donington Road&quot;. It passes the Texaco &quot;Bicker Bar Service Station&quot; on the left at the roundabout with the A17. It meets a roundabout for Swineshead and passes through Drayton, meets the B1391 as &quot;Abbey Lane&quot;, then &quot;Drayton Road&quot;. At Baythorpe passing the popular 2014 FARMA award-winning Manor Farm Shop Best UK small farm shop it becomes &quot;Boston Road&quot; and the B1192 joins to the left at Kirton Holme. At the Poachers Hotel it becomes &quot;Swineshead Road&quot;. There are crossroads again with the B1192 (for Hubbert&#x27;s Bridge to the left) at the &quot;Four Crossroads Inn&quot; at Baker&#x27;s Bridge. Near Boston, you will not find a straighter or flatter road, as the road follows the New Hammond Beck.
It passes Wyberton Fen and meets a roundabout with a Tesco superstore and B&amp;Q on the left at Chain Bridge. The Hammer &amp; Pincers pub is on the left just before a roundabout, where the main route follows to the left, and the straight-on direction is for Wyberton. The Alban Retail Park is on the right before it crosses the South Forty-Foot Drain and railway at a level crossing, then meets the A1121 from the left at a mini-roundabout close to a Peugeot, Citroën and BMW garage. It enters Boston as &quot;Sleaford Road&quot; along a long straight avenue of trees, passing the &quot;Shell Boston&quot; garage on the right.

There are crossroads for &quot;Brothertoft Road&quot; (A1137), which can be used to avoid the busy town centre, then a mini-roundabout with &quot;Carlton Road&quot; becoming &quot;Queen Street&quot;. There are crossroads, with Asda to the left, just before a level crossing with the railway near the railway station. There is a mini-roundabout with &quot;West Street&quot; to the left near &quot;The Eagle&quot; pub and it becomes &quot;Liquorpond Street&quot;. There is a retail park with a McDonald&#x27;s on the right. There are some crossroads with &quot;King Street&quot;, then Marriotts Mazda garage on the left before a roundabout with the A16 &quot;Spalding Road&quot; (which it overlaps through Boston). Some residents want a bypass. An alternative for cars could be to take the B1192/B1184 through Hubbert&#x27;s Bridge and Sibsey, rejoining at Old Leake.

===Boston – Mablethorpe===
In Boston, it follows the inner relief road, where it becomes &quot;John Adams Way&quot;, which crosses the River Witham (where it is tidal) on the £220,000 Haven Bridge, which opened in June 1966. It passes the Esso &quot;John Adams Way Service Station&quot; on the right, close to two speed cameras in either direction and overshadowed by the floodlights of Boston United. There are traffic lights at a roundabout with the A1137/B1183 (for Horncastle), where the inner-relief road ends near the &quot;Red Cow Hotel&quot;. Boston Shopping Park is on the left, and the road becomes &quot;Spilsby Road&quot; where it crosses the Maud Foster Drain] at Bargate Bridge near Maud Foster Windmill. It passes Holy Trinity church on the left, and the &quot;Mill Inn&quot; which is close to Boston High School. The road has a roundabout with the A16 and becomes &quot;Wainfleet Road&quot;. At the &quot;Burton Corner&quot; roundabout, Skegness is signposted in the direction of the A16. It passes the &quot;Burton House&quot; on the right, then passes the &quot;Ball House Inn&quot; at Willoughby Hills. It crosses the Hobhole Drain at Haltoft End where it passes the Freiston Centre for Environmental Education and the &quot;Castle Inn&quot;. There are right turns for Butterwick and it goes through Benington becoming &quot;Main Road&quot; where it passes All Saints church and the &quot;Admiral Nelson&quot;, then Leverton where it passes St Helena&#x27;s church. Near to Leverton Highgate is the Traveller&#x27;s Rest cafe, and &quot;Three Horseshoes&quot;. It passes through Old Leake, and meets the B1184 near The Giles School and passes the &quot;Bricklayer&#x27;s Arms&quot; and passes near to the &quot;Angel Inn&quot; in Wrangle, then the primary school towards Wrangle Lowgate.

The section between Boston and Skegness has had straighter sections since the late 1990s. Just before a bend to the right where it becomes &quot;Holland Lane&quot; then &quot;Main Road&quot;, it enters the district of East Lindsey. There are left turns for Friskney. It then passes through Friskney Tofts, where it passes the &quot;Barley Mow&quot; near Friskey Eaudyke then Wainfleet Tofts. It passes near to Wainfleet St Mary (near the home of Batemans Brewery) which is now bypassed, and meets the B1195, then crosses the Steeping River and over a level crossing. There is a left turn for Croft and it passes the Pine Trees Leisure Park. Entering Skegness as &quot;Wainfleet Road&quot;, it passes Skegness Retail Park with a Pizza Hut and Skegness Hospital. It meets the B1451 roundabout in the centre of Skegness near a Morrisons (former Safeway) superstore and the railway station becoming &quot;Roman Bank&quot;. After the junction with the A158 (from Lincoln), it is no longer a trunk road, and passes the Total &quot;North End Service Station&quot; on the right.
North of Skegness, it meets Seathorne near the primary school, &quot;Garden City&quot; pub, Skegness Water Leisure Park, Butlins and Fantasy Island. It passes through Ingoldmells and the primary school as &quot;Skegness Road&quot;, heading slightly westwards through Hogsthorpe as &quot;South End&quot; then &quot;High Street&quot;. At Mumby, it meets the B1449 as &quot;Station Road&quot; and passes the St Thomas of Canterbury church and &quot;Red Lion&quot;, with a left turn for Cumberworth. Passing through Huttoft there is the primary school and the &quot;Axe and Cleaver Inn&quot; on &quot;Mumby Road&quot; and &quot;Sutton Road&quot;. Next is Sandilands and it reaches Sutton-on-Sea as &quot;Huttoft Road&quot;, passing the primary school and meets the A1111 at a roundabout, becoming &quot;Trusthorpe Road&quot;. At Trusthorpe as &quot;Sutton Road&quot;, it passes some radio masts. It reaches Mablethorpe as &quot;Seaholme Road&quot; and ends at the junction of &quot;Victoria Road&quot; and the &quot;High Street&quot; (A1104).

<doc id="531250" wikidata="Q349062" url="?curid=531250" title="Bohemond III of Antioch">
<text>Bohemond III of Antioch, also known as Bohemond the Child or the Stammerer (; 1148–1201), was Prince of Antioch from 1163 to 1201. He was the elder son of Constance of Antioch and her first husband, Raymond of Poitiers. Bohemond ascended to the throne after the Antiochene noblemen dethroned his mother with the assistance of the lord of Armenian Cilicia, Thoros II. He fell into captivity in the Battle of Harim in 1164, but the victorious Nur al-Din Zengi, (governor) of Aleppo released him to avoid coming into conflict with the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond went to Constantinople to pay homage to Manuel I Komnenos, who persuaded him to install a Greek Orthodox patriarch in Antioch. The Latin patriarch of Antioch, Aimery of Limoges, placed Antioch under interdict. Bohemond restored Aimery only after the Greek patriarch died during an earthquake in 1170.

Bohemond remained a close ally of the Byzantine Empire. He fought against the new lord of Armenian Cilicia, Mleh, assisting in the restoration of Byzantine rule in the Cilician plain. He also made alliances with the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damascus against Saladin, who had begun to unite the Muslim countries along the borders of the crusader states. Since Bohemond repudiated his second wife and married an Antiochene lady, Patriarch Aimery excommunicated him in 1180.

Bohemond forced the Armenian rulers of Cilicia to accept his suzerainty in the late 1180s. He also secured the County of Tripoli for his second son, Bohemond, in 1187. However, Saladin occupied almost the whole Principality of Antioch in the summer of 1188. To preserve the peace with Saladin, Bohemond did not provide military assistance to the crusaders during the Third Crusade. The expansionist policy of King Leo I of Armenia in the 1190s gave rise to a lasting conflict between Antioch and Cilicia. Bohemond was captured in 1194 by Leo, who tried to seize Antioch, but the burghers formed the Commune of Antioch and expelled the Armenian soldiers from the town. Bohemond was released only after he acknowledged Leo&#x27;s independence.

New conflicts emerged after Bohemond&#x27;s eldest son, Raymond, died in 1197. Raymond&#x27;s widow, who was Leo&#x27;s niece, gave birth to a posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen, but Bohemond&#x27;s younger son, Bohemond of Tripoli, wanted to secure his succession in Antioch with the assistance of the commune. The elderly Bohemond seems to have supported his son during his last years. The War of the Antiochene Succession began with Bohemond&#x27;s death and lasted until 1219.

== Early life ==

Bohemond was the elder son of Princess Constance of Antioch and her first husband, Raymond of Poitiers. He was born around 1148. Prince Raymond died fighting against Nur al-Din Zengi, (governor) of Aleppo, in the Battle of Inab on 29June 1149.

Neither Baldwin III of Jerusalem nor the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos could persuade the widowed Constance to take a new husband. Finally, she chose Raynald of Châtillon, a French knight who had recently settled in Syria. Raynald ruled the principality as Constance&#x27;s husband from 1153 until he was captured by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, in late November 1160 or 1161.

Urged by the Antiochene noblemen, Baldwin III proclaimed Bohemond the rightful ruler, charging Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, with the administration of the principality during Bohemond&#x27;s minority. However, Constance appealed to Manuel Komnenos, who confirmed her position as the sole ruler of Antioch. Constance wanted to retain power even after Bohemond reached the age of majority. However, the Antiochene noblemen rebelled against her with the assistance of Thoros II, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, forcing her to leave Antioch in February 1163.

== Prince of Antioch ==

=== First years ===

Bohemond was installed as prince after his mother was dethroned. Nur ad-Din laid siege to Krak des Chevaliers in the County of Tripoli in September 1163. Raymond III of Tripoli appealed to Bohemond for assistance. Bohemond and Constantine Kalamanos, Byzantine governor of Cilicia, hurried to the castle. The united Christian armies defeated the besiegers in the Battle of al-Buqaia.

Amalric of Jerusalem entrusted the government of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to Bohemond before departing for his campaign against Egypt in July 1164. Taking advantage of Bohemond&#x27;s absence, Nur ad-Din attacked the fortress at Harenc in the Principality of Antioch (present-day Harem, Syria). Bohemond, RaymondIII of Tripoli, ThorosII of Armenian Cilicia, and Constantine Kalamanos joined their forces and marched to Harenc, compelling Nur ad-Din to retreat.

Reynald of Saint-Valery, Lord of Harenc, tried to convince Bohemond not to pursue the enemy, but Bohemond did not follow his advice. The armies clashed at the battle of Harim on 10August 1164. Nur ad-Din almost annihilated the Christian army. Most Christian commanders (including Bohemond) were captured. Two days later, Harenc fell to Nur ad-Din. Nur ad-Din took his prisoners to Aleppo. His advisors urged Nur ad-Din to proceed to Antioch, but he declined, fearing that an attack on Antioch could provoke Emperor Manuel into annexing the principality. Amalric of Jerusalem hurried to Antioch to start negotiations with Nur ad-Din. Before long, Nur ad-Din released Bohemond, along with Thoros II of Cilicia, for a ransom because he regarded them as vassals of the Byzantine emperor.

=== Byzantine alliance ===

Soon after his release, Bohemond visited Emperor Manuel in Constantinople and paid homage to him. In return for monetary aid, Bohemond agreed to allow Athanasius, the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, to accompany him back to Antioch. The Latin Patriarch, Aimery, left Antioch and imposed an interdict on the city. Manuel&#x27;s cousin, Andronicus Komnenus, who was made Byzantine governor of Cilicia in 1166, often visited Antioch to meet Bohemond&#x27;s beautiful young sister, Philippa. Bohemond appealed to Manuel, who dismissed Andronicus, replacing him with Constantine Kalamanos.

Bohemond granted Apamea to the Knights Hospitaller in 1168. An earthquake destroyed most towns of northern Syria on 29June 1170. The Greek Patriarch, Athanasius, died when the edifice of the Cathedral of St.Peter collapsed on him during the Mass. Bohemond went to Qosair (present-day Altınözü, Turkey) and persuaded the exiled Latin Patriarch to return to his see.

Mleh, who had seized Cilicia with Nur ad-Din&#x27;s help, besieged Bagras, the fortress of the Knights Templars near Antioch, in early 1170. Bohemond sought assistance from Amalric of Jerusalem, and their united army defeated Mleh, also forcing him to restore the towns of the Cilician plains to the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond&#x27;s relationship with Armenian Cilicia remained tense, which prevented him from pursuing an active foreign policy until Mleh was dethroned in 1175.

Bohemond concluded an alliance with Gumushtekin, of Aleppo, against Saladin, the Ayyubid ruler of Egypt and Syria, in May 1176. On Bohemond&#x27;s demand, Gumushtekin released his Christian prisoners, including Bohemond&#x27;s stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon. To strengthen his alliance with the Byzantine Empire, in 1177 Bohemond married Theodora, who was closely related to Emperor Manuel.

Bohemond met Philip, Count of Flanders, who had come to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in September 1177. According to the contemporaneous William of Tyre, many crusaders blamed Bohemond and RaymondIII of Tripoli for dissuading Philip from participating in a military campaign against Egypt, preferring instead to take advantage of Philip&#x27;s presence in their own realms. Indeed, in December Philip and Bohemond jointly laid siege to Harenc, a fortress of As-Salih Ismail al-Malik, Emir of Damascus, seizing the opportunity following a mutiny of the garrison. They lifted the siege soon after As-Salih informed them that Saladin (the common enemy of both As-Salih and Bohemond) had left Egypt for Syria. As-Salih paid 50,000 dinars and renounced half of the nearby villages in favor of Bohemond.

Bohemond and Raymond III of Tripoli marched to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in early 1180, according to William of Tyre. Baldwin IV of Jerusalem feared that the two princes (who were his father&#x27;s cousins) had come to dethrone him, the symptoms of his leprosy having become &quot;more and more evident&quot; by that time. Historian Bernard Hamilton, who accepts William of Tyre&#x27;s narration, says that Bohemond and Raymond came to Jerusalem to choose a husband for Baldwin&#x27;s sister and heir, Sibylla, wishing to decrease the influence of the king&#x27;s maternal relatives. However, Baldwin gave her in marriage to Guy of Lusignan, who was supported by their mother, Agnes of Courtenay. Sibylla&#x27;s marriage contributed to the formation of two parties of noblemen. Bohemond, RaymondIII of Tripoli, and the Ibelin brothers became the leaders of the group that opposed Guy of Lusignan.

=== Conflicts ===

Manuel I Komnenos died on 24 September 1180. Bohemond soon repudiated his wife, Theodora, to marry an Antiochene lady of bad reputation, Sibylla. Patriarch Aimery accused Bohemond of adultery and excommunicated him. After Bohemond confiscated church property, Aimery imposed an interdict on Antioch and fled to his fortress at Qosair. Bohemond besieged the fortress, but Rainald II Masoir, Lord of Margat, and other noblemen who supported the patriarch rose up against him.

Baldwin IV sent Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, along with other bishops, and Raynald of Châtillon to Antioch to mediate. After preparatory negotiations with the envoys in Latakia, Bohemond and Aimery met in Antioch. Bohemond agreed to restore confiscated church property and Aimery lifted the interdict, but Bohemond&#x27;s excommunication remained in force because he refused to return to Theodora. Peace was not fully restored, and the leaders of the opposition fled to Armenian Cilicia.

Bohemond made peace with Imad ad-Din Zengi II, the Zengid ruler of Aleppo, in May 1182. However, Imad ad-Din was forced to surrender Aleppo to Saladin on 11June 1183. Fearing an attack on Antioch, Bohemond sold Tarsus to Roupen III, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, to raise funds. BaldwinIV of Jerusalem promised to send 300 knights to Antioch. Saladin did not invade the principality and signed a peace treaty with Bohemond. Bohemond attended the assembly that BaldwinIV had summoned to discuss the administration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in autumn 1183. At the meeting, Guy of Lusignan was dismissed as regent, and his five-year-old stepson, Baldwin, was proclaimed co-ruler. A charter shows that Bohemond was in Acre in April 1185, suggesting that he was present when the leper BaldwinIV died around that time.

Roupen III of Armenian Cilicia laid siege to Lampron, the seat of his rival, Hethum III of Lampron. Hethum sent envoys to Bohemond, seeking his assistance. Bohemond invited Roupen to a banquet to Antioch where he had Roupen captured and imprisoned in 1185. Bohemond invaded Cilicia, but he could not prevent Roupen&#x27;s brother, Leo, from seizing Lampron. An Armenian nobleman, Pagouran of Barbaron, mediated a peace treaty. Roupen agreed to pay a ransom and to renounce Sarventikar, Tall Hamdun, Mamistra, and Adana. He also acknowledged Bohemond&#x27;s suzerainty. After the ransom was paid in 1186, Bohemond released Roupen, who soon reconquered the fortresses and towns that he had ceded to Antioch.

=== Saladin&#x27;s triumph ===

The child Baldwin V of Jerusalem died in late summer 1186. Raymond of Tripoli and his supporters could not prevent BaldwinV&#x27;s mother, Sibylla, and her husband, Guy of Lusignan, from seizing the throne. Baldwin of Ibelin, who was the only Jerusalemite baron to refuse to pay homage to Sibylla and Guy after their coronation, moved to Antioch. Bohemond granted a fief to him.

Nomad Turkmen bands invaded Cilicia, forcing the new ruler, Leo, to swear fealty to Bohemond shortly after his ascension in 1186 or 1187. The Turkmens also broke into the Principality of Antioch, pillaging the lowlands around Latakia and the monasteries in the nearby mountains. Bohemond was forced to make a truce with Al-Muzaffar Umar, Saladin&#x27;s governor in Syria, who joined Saladin&#x27;s invasion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in May. Even so, Bohemond sent 50 knights under the command of his elder son, Raymond, to Jerusalem after a Christian army was almost annihilated in the Battle of Cresson. The Turkmens continued their plundering raid until the Antiochene army defeated them and seized their booty.

Saladin launched a crushing defeat on the Christian army in the Battle of Hattin on 4July 1187. Bohemond&#x27;s son was one of the few Christian leaders to flee from the battlefield. Within three months, Saladin captured almost all towns and fortresses of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. RaymondIII of Tripoli, who died before the end of the year, willed the County of Tripoli to Bohemond&#x27;s elder son and heir, Raymond. Bohemond sent his younger son and namesake to take control of Tripoli, convinced that one ruler could not defend both Antioch and Tripoli. After his son was installed in Tripoli, Bohemond became &quot;the greatest of the Franks and their most extensive ruler&quot;, according to Ibn Al-Athir. Bohemond offered to pay homage to William II of Sicily in exchange for military assistance.

Saladin started the invasion of northern Syria on 1July 1188. His troops captured Latakia on 22 or 23July, Sahyun six days later, and the fortresses along the Orontes River in August. After the Knights Templar surrendered their fortress at Bagras to Saladin on 26September, Bohemond pleaded for a truce, offering the release of his Muslim prisoners. Saladin granted the truce from 1October 1188 to 31May 1189. Bohemond managed to retain only his capital and the port of St Symeon. Saladin stipulated that Antioch was to be surrendered without resistance if no reinforcements came before the end of May 1189. Bohemond urged the Holy Roman emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, to come to Syria, offering him the suzerainty over Antioch.

=== Third crusade ===

Guy of Lusignan, who had recently been released, came to Antioch in July or August 1188. Bohemond did not provide him with military assistance, and Guy left for Tripoli.

Frederick Barbarossa departed from the Holy Roman Empire in May 1189. The defence of Antioch was a principal aim of his crusade, but he died unexpectedly near Seleucia in Asia Minor (present-day Silifke in Turkey) on 10June 1190. His son Duke Frederick VI of Swabia took over the command of the army, but most crusaders decided to return to Europe. The remnants of the German crusaders reached Antioch on 21June 1190. Bohemond paid homage to Frederick of Swabia. Barbarossa&#x27;s body, which had been carried to Antioch, was buried in the cathedral before the duke continued his crusade toward the Holy Land.

In May 1191 Bohemond sailed to Limassol along with Guy of Lusignan and Leo of Cilicia to meet King Richard I of England, who had arrived to reconquer the Holy Land from Saladin. He once again met Richard during the siege of Acre in summer 1191, but he did not provide military support to the crusaders. Bohemond&#x27;s relationship with Leo of Cilicia became tense when Leo captured Bagras and refused to cede it to the Knights Templar.

After Richard of England left the Holy Land, Bohemond met Saladin in Beirut on 30October 1192. According to Ibn Al-Athir, Bohemond &quot;did obeisance&quot; and Saladin &quot;bestowed a robe of honour upon him&quot; at their meeting. They signed a ten-year truce that included both Antioch and Tripoli but did not cover Armenian Cilicia even though Leo of Cilicia was Bohemond&#x27;s vassal.

=== Last years ===

Bohemond&#x27;s wife, Sibylla, wanted to secure Antioch for her son, William, with the assistance of Leo of Cilicia (whose wife, Isabel, was her niece). Leo invited Bohemond and his family to Bagras, saying that he wanted to start negotiations regarding the surrender of the fortress either to Antioch or to the Templars in early 1194. The meeting was a trap: Bohemond was captured and taken to Leo&#x27;s capital, Sis.

Bohemond was compelled to surrender Antioch to Leo. He appointed his marshal, Bartholomew Tirel, to accompany the Armenian troops, which were under the command of Hethoum of Sason, to Antioch. The Antiochene noblemen allowed Leo&#x27;s soldiers to enter the town, but the mainly Greek and Latin burgers opposed Leo&#x27;s rule. An Armenian soldier&#x27;s rude remark about Saint Hilary, to whom the royal chapel was dedicated, provoked a riot, forcing the Armenians to withdraw from the town. The burghers assembled in the cathedral to form a commune under the auspices of Patriarch Aimery. They declared Bohemond&#x27;s eldest son, Raymond, regent for his imprisoned father. Raymond&#x27;s younger brother, Bohemond, also hurried from Tripoli to Antioch, and the Armenian forces had to return to Cilicia.

Henry I of Jerusalem came to Antioch to mediate a peace treaty in early 1195. After Bohemond renounced his claim to suzerainty over Cilicia and acknowledged Leo&#x27;s possession of Bagras, Leo released him and his retainers. Before long, Bohemond&#x27;s son, Raymond, married Leo&#x27;s niece and heir, Alice.

Raymond died in early 1197, but his widow gave birth to a posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. The elderly Bohemond sent her and her infant son to Cilicia wanting either to secure Antioch for his son by Sibylla, or to guarantee their security. Bohemond assisted Duke Henry I of Brabant in capturing Beirut in October 1197. Before long, he decided to besiege Jabala and Latakia, but he had to return to Antioch to meet the papal legate, Conrad of Wittelsbach, the archbishop of Mainz. The archbishop had come to Antioch to secure Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s right to succeed Bohemond. On Conrad&#x27;s demand, Bohemond summoned the Antiochene noblemen, who swore fealty to his grandson.

Bohemond of Tripoli regarded himself his father&#x27;s lawful heir, because he was Bohemond&#x27;s elder surviving son. He came to Antioch at the end of 1198 and persuaded the commune to accept his rule. Before long, the younger Bohemond returned to Tripoli, enabling his father to re-take control of state affairs, suggesting that the elder Bohemond had tacitly supported his son&#x27;s coup. LeoI of Cilicia appealed to the Holy See to protect Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s interest, but the Knights Templar submitted a complaint against him for refusing to restore Bagras to them.

Bohemond died in April 1201. His son hurried to Antioch to attend his funeral. The commune proclaimed him prince, but many noblemen who remained loyal to Raymond-Roupen fled to Cilicia. The ensuing War of the Antiochene Succession lasted for years, until the death of Leo in May 1219.

== Family ==
Bohemond&#x27;s first wife, Orgueilleuse of Harenc, was first mentioned in charters issued in 1170, suggesting that Bohemond married her in or before that year. She was last mentioned in February or March 1175. She was the mother of Bohemond&#x27;s two eldest sons, Raymond and Bohemond.

Bohemond&#x27;s second wife, Theodora (whom the &quot;Lignages d&#x27;Outremer&quot; mentioned as Irene) was a relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Historian Charles M. Brand identifies her as the daughter of Manuel&#x27;s nephew, John Doukas Komnenos. According to the &quot;Lignages d&#x27;Outremer&quot;, Theodora gave birth to a daughter, Constance, who was not mentioned in other sources.

William of Tyre described Sibylla, the third wife of Bohemond, as a witch who &quot;practised evil magics&quot; to seduce Bohemond. Michael the Syrian stated that Sibylla was a whore. Her sister was the wife of Bohemond&#x27;s vassal, the lord of Burzey, and Ali ibn al-Athir described this sister as a spy who was &quot;in correspondence with Saladin and exchanged gifts with him.&quot; Bohemond and Sibylla&#x27;s daughter, Alice, became the wife of the wealthy Lord Guy I Embriaco of Jabala. William, the son of Bohemond and Sibylla, may have been named for William II of Sicily. In his fourth marriage, Bohemond married Isabella of Farabel, with whom he had Bohemond of Botron, who married Isabelle, heiress to the Lordship of Botrun.

<doc id="531257" wikidata="Q3043192" url="?curid=531257" title="Definition of terrorism">
<text>There is no legal or scientific consensus on the definition of terrorism. Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism, and governments have been reluctant to formulate an agreed-upon legally-binding definition. Difficulties arise from the fact that the term has become politically and emotionally charged. A simple definition proposed to the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) by terrorism studies scholar Alex P. Schmid in 1992, based on the already internationally accepted definition of war crimes, as &quot;peacetime equivalents of war crimes&quot;, was not accepted.

Scholars have worked on creating various academic definitions, reaching a consensus definition published by Schmid and A. J. Jongman in 1988, with a longer revised version published by Schmid in 2011, some years after he had written that &quot;the price for consensus [had] led to a reduction of complexity&quot;. &quot;The Cambridge History of Terrorism&quot; (2021), however, states that Schmid&#x27;s &quot;consensus&quot; resembles an intersection of definitions, rather than a bona fide consensus.

The United Nations General Assembly condemned terrorist acts by using the following political description of terrorism in December 1994 (GA Res. 49/60):
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;terrorism&quot; comes from French , from , &quot;great fear&quot;, &quot;dread&quot;, related to the Latin verb , &quot;to frighten&quot;. 

The French National Convention declared in September 1793 that &quot;terror is the order of the day&quot;. The period 1793–94 is referred to as (Reign of Terror). Maximilien Robespierre, a leader in the French Revolution proclaimed in 1794 that &quot;Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible.&quot;
The Committee of Public Safety agents that enforced the policies of &quot;The Terror&quot; were referred to as &quot;Terrorists&quot;. The word &quot;terrorism&quot; was first recorded in English-language dictionaries in 1798 as meaning &quot;systematic use of terror as a policy&quot;.

Although the Reign of Terror was imposed by the French government, in modern times &quot;terrorism&quot; usually refers to the killing of people by non-governmental political activists for political reasons, often as a public statement. This meaning originated with Russian radicals in the 1870s. Sergey Nechayev, who founded the &quot;People&#x27;s Reprisal&quot; (Народная расправа) in 1869, described himself as a &quot;terrorist&quot;. German radicalist writer Johann Most helped popularize the modern sense of the word by dispensing &quot;advice for terrorists&quot; in the 1880s.

According to Myra Williamson (2009): &quot;The meaning of &#x27;terrorism&#x27; has undergone a transformation. During the reign of terror a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary state against the enemies of the people. Now the term &#x27;terrorism&#x27; is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by &quot;non-state or subnational entities&quot; against a state&quot;.

==Notable definitions of terrorism==
Definitions include:

* &quot;the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders&quot; (Michael Walzer, 2002).
* &quot;the organized use of violence to attack non-combatants (‘innocents’ in a special sense) or their property for political purposes&quot; (C. A. J. Coady, 2004).
* &quot;the deliberate use of violence, or threat of its use, against innocent people, with the aim of intimidating some other people into a course of action they otherwise would not take&quot; (Igor Primoratz, 2004).
* &quot;the use of force or violence or the threat of force or violence to change the behavior of society as a whole through the causation of fear and the targeting of specific parts of society in order to affect the entire society&quot; (Arthur H. Garrison, 2004).
* &quot;The premediated use or threat to use violence by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political or social objective through the intimidation of a large audience beyond that of the immediate victims&quot; (Todd Sandler, 2010).
* &quot;a doctrine about the presumed effectiveness of a special form or tactic of fear-generating, coercive political violence... [as well as] a conspiratorial practice of calculated, demonstrative, direct violent action without legal or moral restraints, targeting mainly civilians and non-combatants, performed for its propagandistic and psychological effects on various audiences and conflict parties&quot; (Schmid, 2011).
Bruce Hoffman notes that terrorism is &quot;ineluctably about power&quot;.

==General criteria==
Terrorism has been described as:
* The use of violence or of the threat of violence in the pursuit of political objectives
* Acts committed by non-state actors (or by undercover personnel serving on the behalf of their respective governments)
*The intentional use of lethal force against civilians, and/or destructive force against civilian areas, buildings or infrastructure.
* Acts reaching more than the immediate target victims and also directed at targets consisting of a larger spectrum of society 
* Both &quot;mala prohibita&quot; (i.e., crime that is made illegal by legislation) and &quot;mala in se&quot; (i.e., crime that is inherently immoral or wrong)

Definitions of terrorism typically emphasize one or more of the following features:

# Its effect of extreme fear
# Whether it targeted the state from within
# Its strategic goals
# Its random or indiscriminate nature
# Who it targeted
# Whether it was planned and prepared in secret

The following criteria of violence or threat of violence usually fall outside of the definition of terrorism:
* Wartime (including a declared war) or peacetime acts of violence committed by a nation state against another nation state regardless of legality or illegality and are carried out by properly uniformed forces or legal combatants of such nation states
* Reasonable acts of self-defense, such as the use of force to kill, apprehend, or punish criminals who pose a threat to the lives of humans or property
* Legitimate targets in war, such as enemy combatants and strategic infrastructure that form an integral part of the enemy&#x27;s war effort such as defense industries and ports
* Collateral damage, including the infliction of incidental damage to non-combatant targets during an attack on or attempting to attack legitimate targets in war

Scholar Ken Duncan argues the term terrorism has generally been used to describe violence by non-state actors rather than government violence since the 19th-century Anarchist Movement.

==In international law==
===The need to define terrorism in international criminal law===
Schmid (2004) summarised many sources when he wrote: &quot;It is widely agreed that international terrorism can only be fought by international cooperation&quot;. If states do not agree on what constitutes terrorism, the chances of cooperation between countries is reduced; for example, agreement is needed so that extradition is possible.

Ben Saul has noted (2008): &quot;A combination of pragmatic and principled arguments supports the case for defining terrorism in international law&quot;. Reasons for why terrorism needs to be defined by the international community include the need to condemn violations to human rights; to protect the state and its constitutional order, which protects rights; to differentiate public and private violence; to ensure international peace and security, and &quot;control the operation of mandatory Security Council measures since 2001&quot;.

Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the negotiations of the proposed United Nations Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (proposed in 1996 and not yet achieved), noted in 2008 the need to provide a precise definition of terrorist activities in international law: &quot;Criminal law has three purposes: to declare that a conduct is forbidden, to prevent it, and to express society&#x27;s condemnation for the wrongful acts. The symbolic, normative role of criminalization is of particular importance in the case of terrorism. The criminalization of terrorist acts expresses society&#x27;s repugnance at them, invokes social censure and shame, and stigmatizes those who commit them. Moreover, by creating and reaffirming values, criminalization may serve, in the long run, as a deterrent to terrorism, as those values are internalized.&quot; Thus, international criminal law treaties that seek to prevent, condemn and punish terrorist activities, require precise definitions:

Saul noted in this sense that, missing a generally agreed, all-encompassing, definition of the term:
====Obstacles to a comprehensive definition====
There are many reasons for the failure to achieve universal consensus regarding the definition of terrorism, not least that it is such a &quot;complex and multidimensional phenomenon&quot;. In addition, the term has been used broadly, to describe so many different incidents and events that scholar Louise Richardson has said that the term &quot;has become so widely used in many contexts as to become almost meaningless&quot;. An analysis of 73 different definitions in 2004 came up with only five common elements, which excluded any reference to victims, fear/terror, motive, non-combatant targets or the criminal nature of the tactics used.

Historically, the dispute on the meaning of terrorism arose since the laws of war were first codified in 1899. The Martens Clause was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.

More recently the 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, which applies in situations Article 1. Paragraph 4 &quot;... in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes...&quot;, contains many ambiguities that cloud the issue of who is or is not a legitimate combatant.

In a briefing paper for the Australian Parliament in 2002, Angus Martyn stated: 

The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.

Diaz-Paniagua (2008) has noted that, to &quot;create an effective legal regime against terrorism, it would be necessary to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate&quot;. Nonetheless, due to major divergences at the international level on the question of the legitimacy of the use of violence for political purposes, either by states or by self-determination and revolutionary groups, this has not yet been possible.&quot; In this sense, M. Cherif Bassiouni (1988) notes:

Sami Zeidan, a diplomat and scholar, explained the political reasons underlying the current difficulties to define terrorism as follows (2004):
In the same vein, Jason Burke (2003), a British reporter who writes about radical Islamist activity, said:
The political and emotional connotation of the term &quot;terrorism&quot; makes difficult its use in legal discourse. In this sense, Saul (2004) notes that: 
As scholar Bruce Hoffman (1998) has noted: &quot;terrorism is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one&#x27;s enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. (...) Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization &#x27;terrorist&#x27; becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.&quot; For this and for political reasons, many news sources (such as Reuters) avoid using this term, opting instead for less accusatory words like &quot;bombers&quot;, &quot;militants&quot;, etc.

The term has been depicted as carrying racist, xenophobic and ethnocentric connotations when used as an ethnic slur aimed at Arabs or Middle Easterners, or at someone of Arab or Greater Middle Eastern descent or when used by white supremacists.

These difficulties led Pamala Griset (2003) to conclude that: &quot;the meaning of terrorism is embedded in a person&#x27;s or nation&#x27;s philosophy. Thus, the determination of the &#x27;right&#x27; definition of terrorism is subjective&quot;.

While discussing the definitional and ethical difficulties of terrorism, philosopher Jenny Teichman argues that &quot;it ought not to be impossible to find an agreed definition, and then ask whether one wants to condemn or applaud all or some of the things that fall under &quot;that&quot; description&quot;. Experts disagree on &quot;whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of &quot;terror&quot; for a definition of &quot;terrorism&quot;&quot;.

====The sectoral approach====
To elaborate an effective legal regime to prevent and punish international terrorism—rather than only working on a single, all-encompassing, comprehensive definition of terrorism—the international community has also adopted a &quot;...&#x27;sectoral&#x27; approach aimed at identifying offences seen as belonging to the activities of terrorists and working out treaties in order to deal with specific categories thereof&quot;. The treaties that follow this approach focus on the wrongful nature of terrorist activities rather than on their intent:

Following this approach, the international community adopted 12 sectoral counter-terrorism conventions, open to the ratification of all states, between 1963 and 2005 (see below), relating to types of acts (such as aboard an aircraft, taking hostages, bombings, nuclear terrorism, etc.).

Analyzing these treaties, Andrew Byrnes observed that:
Byrnes notes that &quot;this act-specific approach to addressing problems of terrorism in binding international treaties has continued up until relatively recently. Although political denunciation of terrorism in all its forms had continued apace, there had been no successful attempt to define &#x27;terrorism&#x27; as such in a broad sense that was satisfactory for legal purposes. There was also some scepticism as to the necessity, desirability and feasibility of producing an agreed and workable general definition.&quot; Nonetheless, the same committee of the United Nations General Assembly which authored the 1997 Bombing Convention and the 1999 Financing Convention has been working on a proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, given renewed impetus by the September 11 attacks in 2001.

===Comprehensive conventions===
The international community has worked on two comprehensive counter-terrorism treaties, the League of Nations&#x27; 1937 Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism, which never entered into force, and the United Nations&#x27; proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which has not yet been finalized.

====League of Nations (1930s)====
In the late 1930s, the international community made a first attempt at defining terrorism. Article 1.1 of the League of Nations&#x27; 1937 Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism defined &quot;acts of terrorism&quot; as &quot;criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public&quot;. Article 2 included as terrorist acts, if they were directed against another state and if they constituted acts of terrorism within the meaning of the definition contained in article 1, the following:
These articles never entered into force, owing to lack of support.

====UN Comprehensive Convention (1997–present)====
Since 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.

In 1996 an Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism was set up, with the remit of drafting several conventions condemning various aspects of terrorism, with the intention of producing a final Comprehensive Convention which would either supplement or replace the series of sectoral conventions.

Since January 1997, the United Nations General Assembly has been negotiating a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. The definition of the crime of terrorism on the negotiating table reads as follows (GA Resolution 51/210, Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, December 1996; adopted January 1997):
Among the negotiators, the 1996/7 definition is not controversial in itself; the deadlock in the negotiations arises instead from the opposing views on whether such a definition would be applicable to the armed forces of a state and to self-determination movements. Thalif Deen described the situation as follows: &quot;The key sticking points in the draft treaty revolve around several controversial yet basic issues, including the definition of ´terrorism´. For example, what distinguishes a &quot;terrorist organisation&quot; from a &#x27;liberation movement&#x27;? And do you exclude activities of national armed forces, even if they are perceived to commit acts of terrorism? If not, how much of this constitutes &#x27;state terrorism&#x27;?&quot;

In 2002, the coordinator of the negotiations, supported by most western delegations, proposed the following exceptions to address those issues:
In November 2004, a Secretary-General of the United Nations report described terrorism as any act &quot;intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act&quot;.

The state members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference proposed instead the following exceptions:
===Sectoral conventions (1963–2005)===
The various sectoral counter-terrorism conventions, or treaties, define as terrorist particular categories of activities. These include:

* The 1963 Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft 
* The 1970 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft 
* The 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation
* The 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages 
* The 1979 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 
* The 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation 
* The 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation 
* The 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf 
* The 1991 Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Identification 
* The 1997 International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings 
* The 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism 
* The 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism

====1997: Terrorist Bombings Convention====

Article 2.1 of the 1997 International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings defines the offence of terrorist bombing as follows:

Article 19 expressly excluded from the scope of the convention certain activities of state armed forces and of self-determination movements as follows:
====1999: Terrorist Financing Convention====

Article 2.1 of the 1999 sectoral United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (Terrorist Financing Convention) defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offence committed by &quot;any person&quot; who &quot;by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out&quot; an act &quot;intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.&quot;

====2005: Nuclear Terrorism Convention====

The 2005 United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism defines the crime of nuclear terrorism as follows:
Article 4 of the convention expressly excluded from the application of the convention the use of nuclear weapons during armed conflicts without, though, recognizing the legality of the use of those weapons:
===Definitions of terrorism in other UN decisions===
In parallel with the criminal law codification efforts, some United Nations organs have put forward some broad political definitions of terrorism.

The United Nations did not focus any debate on terrorism until 1972, after the terrorist attack at the Olympic Games in Munich.

====UN General Assembly Resolutions (1972, 1994/6)====
In 1972 the General Assembly passed a resolution titled &quot;Measures to prevent international terrorism which endangers or takes innocent human lives or jeopardises fundamental freedoms, and study of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts ofviolence which lie in misery, frustration, grievance and despair, and which cause some people to sacrifice human lives, including their own, in an attempt to effect radical changes&quot;. An Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism, consisting of three sub-committees, was established, but no consensus was reached on the various draft proposals submitted, and the matter was again put aside until the Cold War had ended (1991).

In 1994, the General Assembly agreed on a declaration that terrorism was &quot;criminal and unjustifiable&quot;, condemning all such acts &quot;wherever and by whomever committed&quot;, in its &quot;Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism&quot; (GA Res. 49/60).

A 1996 non-binding United Nations Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism (which described terrorism as &quot;Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them&quot;) annexed to the UN General Assembly Resolution 51/210, described terrorist activities in the following terms:
Antonio Cassese has argued that the language of this and other similar UN declarations &quot;sets out an acceptable definition of terrorism.&quot;

Each year, a legal committee of the General Assembly meets to discuss international cooperation to counter terrorism, and in 2019 the committee &quot;reaffirmed the importance of the negotiations on and successful conclusion of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism&quot; and the need for consensus for this and in particular stressed &quot;the importance of negotiating an internationally agreed definition of terrorism&quot;.

====UN Security Council (1999, 2004)====
In 1999, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1269 unanimously, which &quot;unequivocally condemn[ed] all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation&quot;.

In 2004, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1566 condemned terrorist acts as:
====High-Level Panel (2004)====

Also in 2004, a High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change composed of independent experts and convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations called states to set aside their differences and to adopt, in the text of a proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, the following political &quot;description of terrorism&quot;:
The following year, Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan endorsed the High Level Panel&#x27;s definition of terrorism and asked states to set aside their differences and to adopt that definition within the proposed comprehensive terrorism convention before the end of that year. He said:
The suggestion of incorporating this definition of terrorism into the comprehensive convention was rejected. Some United Nations&#x27; member states contended that a definition such as the one proposed by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and endorsed by the Secretary General, lacked the necessary requirements to be incorporated in a criminal law instrument. Diaz-Paniagua stated that a comprehensive definition of terrorism to be included in a criminal law treaty must have &quot;legal precision, certainty, and fair-labeling of the criminal conduct - all of which emanate from the basic human rights obligation to observe due process&quot;.

===European Union===
The European Union defines terrorism for legal/official purposes in Art. 1 of the &quot;Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism&quot; (2002). This provides that terrorist offences are certain criminal offences set out in a list consisting largely of serious offences against persons and property that: 
===North Atlantic Treaty Organization===
NATO defines terrorism in the AAP-06 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, Edition 2019 as &quot;The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence, instilling fear and terror, against individuals or property in an attempt to coerce or intimidate governments or societies, or to gain control over a population, to achieve political, religious or ideological objectives&quot;.

==In national law==
===Australia===
, the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1995&quot; (known as the Criminal Code), representing the federal government&#x27;s criminal law and including Australia&#x27;s laws against terrorism, defines &quot;terrorist act&quot; in Section 5.3. The definition, after defining in (a) the harms that may be caused (and excluding accidental harm or various actions undertaken as advocacy) defines a terrorist act as:
Within the Criminal Code, a variety of offences are defined with reference to the definition of a terrorist act, for example financing terrorism, activities which advocate violent terrorist acts, etc.

===Argentina===
The Argentine National Reorganization Process dictatorship, which lasted from 1976 to 1983, defined &quot;terrorist&quot; as &quot;not only who set bombs and carry guns, but also those who spread ideas opposite to Christian and western civilization&quot;.

=== Brazil ===
In 2016, Brazil passed a law that defines acts of terrorism and establishes punishment for committing, planning, enabling, sponsoring, inciting and participating in terrorist acts. The bill lists a series of acts that provoke social and general terror or endanger people, property, infrastructure, or public peace, for reasons of xenophobia, discrimination or prejudice of race, color, ethnicity and religion. Shortly after the creation of the law, Federal Police&#x27;s Operation Hashtag arrested eleven suspects of planning a terrorist attack in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, section 83.01 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; defines terrorism as an act committed &quot;in whole or in part for a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause&quot; with the objective of intimidating the public &quot;with regard to its security, including its economic security, or compelling a person, a government or a domestic or an international organization to do or to refrain from doing any act.&quot;

=== France ===
In 1986, France adopted its first &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; law. The French legal definition of &quot;acts of terrorism&quot; as in force since 2016 is to be found in the French criminal code, article 421. The article starts with: 
===India===
The Supreme Court of India quoted Alex P. Schmid&#x27;s definition of terrorism in a 2003 ruling (Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar), &quot;defin[ing] acts of terrorism veritably as &#x27;peacetime equivalents of war crimes.&#x27;&quot;

The now lapsed Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act specified the following definition of terrorism:

===Pakistan===
The Pakistan Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 1999 states:

A person is said to commit a terrorist act if he,

(a) in order to, or if the effect of his actions will be to, strike terror or create a sense of fear and insecurity in the people, or any section of the people, does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive or inflammable substances, or such fire-arms or other lethal weapons as may be notified, or poisons or noxious gases or chemicals, in such a manner as to cause, or be likely to cause, the death of, or injury to, any person or persons, or damage to, or destruction of, property on a large scale, or a widespread disruption of supplies of services essential to the life of the community, or threatens with the use of force public servants in order to prevent them from discharging their lawful duties; or

(b) commits a scheduled offence, the effect of which will be, or be likely to be, to strike terror, or create a sense of fear and insecurity in the people, or any section of the people, or to adversely affect harmony among different sections of the people; or

(c) commits an act of gang rape, child molestation, or robbery coupled with rape as specified in the Schedule to this Act; or

(d) commits an act of civil commotion as specified in section &amp;A.&quot;
=== Philippines ===
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, officially designated as Republic Act No. 11479, is a counter-terrorism law intended to prevent, prohibit, and penalize terrorism in the Philippines. The law was passed by the 18th Congress and signed by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020, effectively replacing the Human Security Act of 2007 on July 18, 2020.

The Act defines terrorism as:

* Engaging in acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person or endangers a person&#x27;s life;
* Engaging in acts intended to cause extensive damage or destruction to a government or public facility, public place, or private property;
* Engaging in acts intended to cause extensive interference with, damage, or destruction to critical infrastructure;
* Developing, manufacturing, possessing, acquiring, transporting, supplying, or using weapons; and
* Releasing dangerous substances or causing fire, floods or explosions when the purpose is to intimidate the general public, create an atmosphere to spread a message of fear, provoke or influence by intimidation the government or any international organization, seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic, or social structures in the country, or create a public emergency or seriously undermine public safety.

The definition states that &quot;advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights&quot; shall not be considered as terrorist acts only if they &quot;are not intended to cause death or serious physical harm to a person, to endanger a person&#x27;s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety.&quot;

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Interior Ministry issued a set of anti-terrorist laws in 2014. According to Article 1 and 2:

&quot;Calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based&quot; and anyone who questions the King or the government or supports any group, party, organization other than that of the ruling elite inside or outside the Kingdom is a terrorist.

References to atheism were absent from Saudi Arabia&#x27;s public draft of Law on Combating the Financing of Terrorism as of October 2023.

===Syria===
After the United States attack on Abu Kamal, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem defined terrorism as &quot;Killing civilians in international law means a terrorist aggression.&quot;

===Turkey===
The definition of &quot;Terrorism&quot; in Article 1 of Anti-Terror Law 3713 is: &quot;Terrorism is any kind of act done by one or more persons belonging to an organization with the aim of changing the characteristics of the Republic as specified in the Constitution, its political, legal, social, secular and economic system, damaging the indivisible unity of the State with its territory and nation, endangering the existence of the Turkish State and Republic, weakening or destroying or seizing the authority of the State, eliminating fundamental rights and freedoms, or damaging the internal and external security of the State, public order or general health by means of pressure, force and violence, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s Terrorism Act 2000 defined terrorism as follows:
Section 34 of the Terrorism Act 2006 amended sections 1(1)(b) and 113(1)(c) of Terrorism Act 2000 to include &quot;international governmental organisations&quot; in addition to &quot;government&quot;.

Successive Independent Reviewers of Terrorism Legislation (most recently in a report of July 2014) have commented on the UK&#x27;s definition of terrorism.

===United States===
====U.S. Code (U.S.C.)====
Title 22, Chapter 38, Section 2656f, of the United States Code (regarding the Department of State) contains a definition of terrorism in its requirement that annual country reports on terrorism be submitted by the Secretary of State to Congress every year. It reads:
Title 18 of the United States Code (regarding criminal acts and criminal procedure) defines international terrorism as:
Commenting on the genesis of this provision, Edward Peck, former U.S. Chief of Mission in Iraq (under Jimmy Carter) and former ambassador to Mauritania said:
====U.S. Code of Federal Regulations====
The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as &quot;the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives&quot; (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85).

====U.S. Department of Defense====
The U.S. Department of Defense recently changed its definition of terrorism. Per Joint Pub 3-07.2, &quot;Antiterrorism,&quot; (24 November 2010), the Department of Defense defines it as &quot;the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence to instill fear and coerce governments or societies. Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit of goals that are usually political.&quot;

The new definition distinguishes between motivations for terrorism (religion, ideology, etc.) and goals of terrorism (&quot;usually political&quot;). This is in contrast to the previous definition which stated that the goals could be religious in nature.

====U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency====
The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contains a definition of terrorism, which reads:

The new definition does not require that the act needs to be politically motivated. The FEMA also said that terrorism &quot;include threats of terrorism; assassinations; kidnappings; hijackings; bomb scares and bombings; cyber attacks (computer-based); and the use of chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological weapons&quot; and also states that &quot;[h]igh-risk targets for acts of terrorism include military and civilian government facilities, international airports, large cities, and high-profile landmarks. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. Further, terrorists are capable of spreading fear by sending explosives or chemical and biological agents through the mail.&quot;

====U.S. National Counterterrorism Center====
The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) define terrorism the same as United States Code 22 USC § 2656f(d)(2). The Center also defines a terrorist act as a &quot;premeditated; perpetrated by a sub-national or clandestine agent; politically motivated, potentially including religious, philosophical, or culturally symbolic motivations; violent; and perpetrated against a non-combatant target.&quot;

====U.S. national security strategy====
In September 2002, the U.S. national security strategy defined terrorism as &quot;premeditated, politically motivated violence against innocents.&quot; This definition did not exclude actions by the United States government and it was qualified some months later with &quot;premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents&quot;.

====USA PATRIOT Act of 2001====
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines domestic terrorism as &quot;activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.&quot;

====Terrorism Risk Insurance Act====
Section 102(1)(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act contains a definition of terrorism in order for insurance companies to provide coverage to all prospective policy holders at time of purchase and to all current policyholders at renewal and requires that the federal government pay 90 percent of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage. It reads:
==Insurance coverage==
After the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., many insurers made specific exclusions for terrorism in their policies, after global reinsurers withdrew from covering terrorism. Some governments introduced legislation to provide support for insurers in various ways.

*In Australia, the &quot;Terrorism Insurance Act 2003&quot; created a scheme to administer reinsurance scheme for insurance, relating to commercial properties and enterprises, but excluding residential properties, travel insurance, vehicles, and others. This legislation uses the same definition as specified in the Criminal Code (see above). The act&#x27;s definition has only been applied once, when in 2015 the Federal Treasurer declared the 2014 Lindt Café siege as a &quot;declared terrorist incident&quot; under the act, although there was some debate about the classification of this incident. Twenty insurers made 92 claims, for a total of , for various losses caused by the siege.
*In the U.S., the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (2002) provides a government reinsurance backstop in case of large-scale terrorist attacks, requiring that commercial insurers offer terrorism coverage for the types of insurance included in the act. This Act includes a definition of terrorism (see above).

Some insurance companies exclude terrorism from general property insurance. An insurance company may include a specific definition of terrorism as part of its policy, for the purpose of excluding at least some loss or damage caused by terrorism. For example, RAC Insurance in Western Australia defines terrorism thus:
It is noted the term Stochastic terrorism began as a method to corelate measurements of violent rhetoric to probability of a terrorists attack. While this term is still used in the technical sense in risk management and insurance assessments, a more populist connotation has developed that is used to characterize the nature of certain terrorist acts in the context of social media influence.

==Timeline of political definitions==
Listed below are some of the historically important understandings of terror and terrorism, and enacted but non-universal definitions of the term:

* 1795. &quot;Government intimidation during the Reign of Terror in France.&quot; The general sense of &quot;systematic use of terror as a policy&quot; was first recorded in English in 1798.
* 1916. Gustave LeBon: &quot;Terrorization has always been employed by revolutionaries no less than by kings, as a means of impressing their enemies, and as an example to those who were doubtful about submitting to them...&quot;
* 1937. League of Nations convention language: &quot;All criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public.&quot;
* 1972, after the terrorist attack at the Olympic Games in Munich. UN General Assembly passed a resolution entitiled &quot;Measures to prevent international terrorism which endangers or takes innocent human lives or jeopardises fundamental freedoms, and study of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts ofviolence which lie in misery, frustration, grievance and despair, and which cause some people to sacrifice human lives, including their own, in anattempt to effect radical changes&quot;. No consensus was reached.
* 1987. A definition proposed by Iran at an international Islamic conference on terrorism: &quot;Terrorism is an act carried out to achieve an inhuman and corrupt &quot;(mufsid)&quot; objective, and involving [a] threat to security of any kind, and violation of rights acknowledged by religion and mankind.&quot;
* 1989. United States: premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub-national groups or clandestine agents.
* 1992. A definition proposed by Alex P. Schmid to the United Nations Crime Branch: &quot;Act of Terrorism = Peacetime Equivalent of War Crime.&quot;
* 1994/1996 United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism&quot;, and 1996 Supplement, Paragraph 3:
* 1996. UN General Assembly sets up an Ad Hoc Committee with the responsibility of drafting several conventions condemning various aspects of terrorism, as well as a final Comprehensive Convention to either supplement or replace the series of sectoral conventions.
* 2002. European Union:
* 2003. India: Referencing Schmid&#x27;s 1992 proposal, the Supreme Court of India described terrorist acts as the &quot;peacetime equivalents of war crimes.&quot;
* 2014. Contained in a Saudi Arabia terrorism law taking effect 1 February 2014, the following definition has been criticized by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for being overly broad:
Any act carried out by an offender in furtherance of an individual or collective project, directly or indirectly, intended to disturb the public order of the state, or to shake the security of society, or the stability of the state, or to expose its national unity to danger, or to suspend the basic law of governance or some of its articles, or to insult the reputation of the state or its position, or to inflict damage upon one of its public utilities or its natural resources, or to attempt to force a governmental authority to carry out or prevent it from carrying out an action, or to threaten to carry out acts that lead to the named purposes or incite [these acts].

* 2016. Brazilian anti-terrorism law:
Terrorism consists in the practice, by one or more individuals, of the acts listed in this article for reasons of xenophobia, discrimination or prejudice of race, color, ethnicity and religion, when committed with the objective of provoking social or generalized terror, exposing people, property, the public peace or the public safety.

==Academic definitions by scholars==
Numerous scholars have proposed working definitions of terrorism.

Schmid and Jongman (1988) counted 109 definitions of terrorism that covered a total of 22 different definitional elements, and Walter Laqueur counted over 100 definitions, concluding that the &quot;only general characteristic generally agreed upon is that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence&quot;. This is clearly inadequate, as many other actions involve both elements.

Bruce Hoffman (2006) has thus noted that:
Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:

A common trait that Terrorists often possess is having persistent childhood disobedience.
After surveying the various academic definitions of terrorism, Rhyl Vallis and others (2004) concluded that:
A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette (2008), a German military officer serving at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:
Academics and practitioners may also be categorized by the definitions of terrorism that they use. A distinction can be made between &quot;act-centric&quot; and &quot;actor-centric&quot; definitions. Actor-centric definitions of terrorism emphasize the characteristics of the groups or individuals who use terrorism. Whilst act-centric definitions emphasize the unique aspects of terrorism from other acts of violence. Max Abrahms (2010) introduced the distinction between what he calls &quot;terrorist lumpers&quot; and &quot;terrorist splitters.&quot; Lumpers define terrorism broadly, brooking no distinction between this tactic and guerrilla warfare or civil war. Terrorist splitters, by contrast, define terrorism narrowly, as the select use of violence against civilians for putative political gain. As Abrahms notes, these two definitions yield different policy implications:
In 2011 Alex Schmid published an updated academic consensus definition in &quot;The Routledge Handbook of Terrorism Research&quot;, which includes additional discussion of the UN struggle to find a legal definition, and 260 other definitions. The revised definition includes 12 points, the first of which is:
===Academic vs legal definition===
Schmid returns to the problem of legal definition in an October 2020 article in &quot;Contemporary Voices&quot;, in which he reviews the history of the efforts to arriving at agreement on a common legal definition of terrorism and names six reasons underlying the challenges faced in achieving this. In a new major work edited by Schmid, &quot;Handbook of Terrorism Prevention and Preparedness&quot; (2020–2021), he states:

In contrast to a consensus on the legal definition however, the 2011 academic definition of terrorism, which is social-scientific rather than legal in nature, has gained a fair degree of acceptance among scholars.

<text>The Unité d&#x27;habitation (, &quot;Housing Unit&quot;) is a modernist residential housing typology developed by Le Corbusier, with the collaboration of painter-architect Nadir Afonso. It formed the basis of several housing developments throughout Europe designed by Le Corbusier and sharing the same name.

The most famous of these buildings is located in the southern part of Marseille, France. It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2016 because of its importance to the development of modernist architecture, along with 16 other works by Le Corbusier. It is also designated a historic monument by the French Ministry of Culture. It was damaged by fire on 9 February 2012.

==History==
In 1920, Le Corbusier started to develop the &quot;Unité d&#x27;Habitation&quot; type, which became influential in 20th century modernism and contemporary residential design in Europe.
The first realizations were built in Paris and Marseille in the 1940s as high-rise concrete structures. During the construction of the Marseille building, a few model apartments were built and furnished for visitors as an exhibition. 

In the 1980s, a team from ETH Zurich surveyed several apartments in Marseille and built several full-scale models for exhibitions in Paris, Karlsruhe, Tokyo and New York. In 1986, a full-scale model was constructed at the &quot;Badischer Kunstverein&quot; by Gernot Bayne based on the survey of Ruggero Tropeano. The same model was then on display at Centre Pompidou. A full scale original kitchen, stairs, and other parts of the apartments are stored and displayed in several museum collections around the world. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York acquired a complete kitchen in 2013.
In 2007, students built a structurally correct full-scale model inside the museum &quot;Cité de l&#x27;Architecture et du Patrimoine&quot; in Paris. &quot;Unité d&#x27;habitation&quot; model apartments have been rebuilt in exhibitions or renovated in their historic style.

== &quot;La Cité Radieuse&quot;, Marseille ==
The first and most famous of the &quot;Unité d&#x27;Habitation&quot; buildings is in Marseille, France, and was built between 1947 and 1952. One of Le Corbusier&#x27;s most famous works, it proved enormously influential and is often cited as the initial inspiration for the Brutalist architectural style and philosophy.

The Marseille building, developed with Le Corbusier&#x27;s designers Shadrach Woods and George Candilis, comprises 337 apartments of 23 different layouts across 12 storeys, and all supported by large &quot;pilotis&quot;. The building also incorporates shops including an architectural bookshop, a rooftop gallery, educational facilities, a hotel that is open to the public, and a restaurant, &quot;Le Ventre de l&#x27;Architecte&quot; (&quot;The Belly of the Architect&quot;). The building is constructed in béton brut (rough-cast concrete), as the hoped-for steel frame proved too expensive due to the post-war steel shortage.

Inside, wide corridors (&quot;streets in the sky&quot;) run along the central long axis of every third floor of the building. Each apartment lies on two levels, such that the room on one side of a corridor belongs to the apartment that is mostly below the corridor floor, while that on the opposite side belongs to the apartment above. On those floors without corridors, the apartments stretch from one side of the building to the other, and each has a balcony on the western side. 

The flat roof is designed as a communal terrace with sculptural ventilation stacks, a running track, and a shallow paddling pool for children. There is also a children&#x27;s art school in the atelier. The roof, where a number of theatrical performances have taken place, was renovated in 2010 and 2022, and since 2013 it has hosted an exhibition center headed by designer Ora-Ïto called the MaMo. The roof has unobstructed views of the Mediterranean Sea and Marseille.

According to Peter Blake, members of CIAM held a &quot;great celebration&quot; for the building&#x27;s opening on its roof, on a summer evening in 1953. &quot;Architects from every part of the world attended&quot;, including Walter Gropius, who said at the event: &quot;Any architect who does not find this building beautiful, had better lay down his pencil.&quot;

Le Corbusier&#x27;s design was criticised by US architect Peter Blake for having small children&#x27;s rooms, some without windows. In the 1980 documentary &quot;The Shock of the New&quot;, Robert Hughes argued that it had &quot;one of the great rooves of the world&quot; that conceptually reflected Le Corbusier&#x27;s admiration for the Acropolis, but criticized other aspects of the building, including the unused space underneath and the small dwellings. Unlike many of the blocks it inspired, which lack the original&#x27;s generous proportions, communal facilities and parkland setting, the &quot;Unité&quot; is popular with its residents and is now mainly occupied by upper middle-class professionals.

== Interiors ==
The apartments were equipped with built-in furniture, and specially designed storage walls with various cupboards with sliding doors, which were designed by Charlotte Perriand in collaboration with Atelier Le Corbusier. Additionally Perriand collaborated on the design of the apartment kitchens, 321 of the 337 units were equipped with the Cuisine Atelier Le Corbusier, type 1 kitchens, many of which are still in place due to their efficient use of space. The steel stairs and the aluminium kitchen counters were designed by Jean Prouvé. Unité d&#x27;habitation model apartments have been renovated in the individual historic Unité buildings as well as rebuilt in exhibitions around the world.

== Other buildings and influences ==
In the block&#x27;s planning, the architect drew on his study of a Soviet communal housing project, the Narkomfin Building in Moscow, designed by the architect Moisei Ginzburg and completed in 1932.

Le Corbusier&#x27;s design for utopian high density housing for cities was repeated in four more buildings with the same name and a very similar design:
* Unité d&#x27;Habitation of Nantes-Rezé in 1955, 
* Unité d&#x27;Habitation of Berlin in 1957, 
* Unité d&#x27;Habitation of Briey in 1963, 
* Unité d&#x27;Habitation of Firminy-Vert in 1965.

All were oriented with the building&#x27;s long axis running north–south, so the units face east and west.

The replacement of steel by rough-cast concrete (&quot;béton brut&quot;) was a key element that seeded the Brutalist Movement. The &quot;Unité d&#x27;Habitation&quot; inspired many brutalist housing complexes. In England such buildings include the Alton West estate in Roehampton, London, and Park Hill in Sheffield, both of which have attracted much negative criticism. More successful English incarnations of the &quot;Unité&quot; include Chamberlin, Powell and Bon&#x27;s Barbican Estate (completed 1982), Gordon Tait&#x27;s Samuda Estate, Isle of Dogs (1965), Ernő Goldfinger&#x27;s Balfron Tower (1967), and Trellick Tower (1972), all in London. The triple-level roof garden of Great Arthur House (1957) inspired by Le Corbusier&#x27;s Unité d&#x27;Habitation is a fine vantage point towards St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Barbican Estate and has panoramic views across London. Roof terrace for the tenants was furnished with a decorative pool, seats and plant boxes. The crowning glory is a distinctive concrete canopy and pergola. The estate was popular with professionals such as doctors and is still a self-sufficient &#x27;urban village&#x27;. It is seen as the most successful of England&#x27;s housing developments from the early 1950s. Designed by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. 

The apartment building &quot;Polska Akademia Nauk&quot; (&quot;Polish Academy of Sciences&quot;) in 20 Wiejska Street in Warsaw, Poland was inspired by Le Corbusier&#x27;s principles. The architect was Jerzy Gieysztor and the building was completed in 1964. Among Central European countries, it is unique for its period. It is an abstract sculptural building that floats over anthropomorphic concrete pillars (&quot;pilotis&quot;). All its apartments are spacious, there is an indoor shopping mall, and the roof terrace has a swimming pool. This building was also inspired by the Polish pavilion from the 1937 World Expo in Paris, especially the sandstone wall relief and the entrance roof with round holes. Other Polish buildings inspired by the Unité d&#x27;Habitation include the Za Żelazną Bramą Housing Estate (Behind the Iron Gate) in Warsaw, and Superjednostka in Katowice, built in the 1970s.

In Scotland, the Glasgow College of Building and Printing (1964), and the Charles Oakley Building, (1963), both former buildings of the City of Glasgow College - were designed in the late 1950s by architect Peter Williams of the local firm Walter Underwood &amp; Partners. They are non-residential educational blocks that differ greatly from Le Corbusier&#x27;s Unité d&#x27;Habitation, inside and outside. Yet the roof terrace of the Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseille inspired Peter Williams to design the rooftops of these college buildings with gymnasia. Both buildings are now Grade II listed, with the Building and Printing College (now known as the &#x27;Met Tower&#x27;) is as of 2023 undergoing restoration and conversion into office space


Other examples of buildings that drew inspiration from Le Corbusier&#x27;s Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseille are:
* A building (1954) in Vukovarska street in Zagreb, designed by architect Drago Galić.
* The Super Andrija building (1973) designed by architect Miroslav Cantinelli (Siget, Novi Zagreb, Siget Street 18) and The Mamutica (Mammoth) building (1974) designed by architects Đuro Mirković and Nevenka Postružnik (Travno, Novi Zagreb, Božidara Magovca Street 3-63). 
* The fire-station in the Boulevard Masséna, Paris, designed by architect Jean Willerval and completed in 1971. The roof terrace has a tennis court. There is a swimming pool on the ground floor.
* The Reserve Square Complex in Cleveland, Ohio, built 1969–1973.
* The Riverside Plaza in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which opened in 1973. Its brutalist design and multi-colored panels were influenced by the Unité d&#x27;Habitation.
* The Akbar Hotel in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi was designed by Shiv Nath Prasad and constructed from 1965-69. It shares many elements.

<doc id="531287" wikidata="Q248404" url="?curid=531287" title="Vesna Vulović">
<text>Vesna Vulović (, ; 3 January 195023 December 2016) was a Serbian flight attendant who survived the highest fall without a parachute: or 33,333 feet. She was the sole survivor of JAT Flight 367 after an explosion tore through the baggage compartment on 26 January 1972, causing it to crash near Srbská Kamenice, Czechoslovakia (now part of the Czech Republic). Air safety investigators attributed the explosion to a briefcase bomb. The Yugoslav authorities suspected that émigré Croatian nationalists were to blame, but no one was ever arrested.

Following the bombing, Vulović spent days in a coma and was hospitalized for several months. She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, broken legs, broken ribs, and a fractured pelvis. These injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Vulović made an almost complete recovery but continued to walk with a limp. She had little to no memory of the incident and had no qualms about flying in the aftermath of the crash. Despite her willingness to resume work as a flight attendant, Jat Airways (JAT) gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts, feeling her presence on flights would attract too much publicity. Vulović became a celebrity in Yugoslavia and was deemed a national hero.

Vulović was fired from JAT in the early 1990s after taking part in anti-government protests during the breakup of Yugoslavia, but avoided arrest as the government was concerned about the negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party, advocating Serbia&#x27;s entry into the European Union. Her final years were spent in seclusion, and she struggled with survivor guilt. Having divorced, Vulović lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.

==Early life==
Vesna Vulović was born in Belgrade on 3 January 1950. Her father was a businessman and her mother was a fitness instructor. Driven by her love of the Beatles, Vulović travelled to the United Kingdom after completing her first year of university, hoping to improve her English language skills. &quot;I initially stayed with my parents&#x27; friends in Newbury,&quot; she recalled, &quot;but wanted to move to London. It was there that I met up with a friend who suggested we go to Stockholm. When I told my parents I was living in the Swedish capital, they thought of the drugs and the sex and told me to come home at once.&quot; Upon returning to Belgrade, Vulović decided to become a flight attendant after seeing one of her friends in a flight attendant&#x27;s uniform. &quot;She looked so nice and had just been to London for the day,&quot; Vulović recalled. &quot;I thought, &#x27;Why shouldn&#x27;t I be an air hostess? I could go to London once a month&#x27;.&quot; She joined JAT, the national flag carrier and dominant airline of Yugoslavia, in 1971.

==JAT Flight 367==

The secondary crew of JAT Flight 367, flying from Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark on the morning of 25 January 1972. According to Vulović, she was not scheduled to be on Flight 367, and JAT had confused her for another flight attendant also named Vesna. Nevertheless, Vulović said that she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. &quot;Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family,&quot; she recalled. &quot;So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed to know that they would die. They didn&#x27;t talk about it, but I saw ... I felt for them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours. He didn&#x27;t want to go out at all. In the morning, during breakfast, the co-pilot was talking about his son and daughter as if nobody else had a son or daughter.&quot;

Flight 367 departed from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30 p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30 p.m., whereupon Vulović and her colleagues boarded the plane. &quot;As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park,&quot; Vulović said. &quot;I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight.&quot;

Flight 367 departed from Copenhagen Airport at 3:15 p.m. At 4:01 p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9&#x27;s baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart over the then-Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović was the only survivor of the 28 passengers and crew. She was discovered by villager Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during the Second World War and was able to keep Vulović alive until rescuers arrived.

Air safety investigators attributed Vulović&#x27;s survival to her being trapped by a food trolley in the DC-9&#x27;s fuselage as it broke away from the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were blown out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović&#x27;s physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an excessive amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.

Between 1962 and 1982, émigré Croatian nationalists carried out 128 terrorist attacks against Yugoslav civilian and military targets. Yugoslav authorities suspected that they were to blame for bringing down Flight 367. On the day of the crash, a bomb exploded aboard a train travelling from Vienna to Zagreb, injuring six. A man, describing himself as a Croatian nationalist, called the Swedish newspaper &quot;Kvällsposten&quot; the following day and claimed responsibility for the bombing of Flight 367. No arrests were ever made. The Czechoslovak Civil Aviation Authority later attributed the explosion to a briefcase bomb.

==Paralysis and recovery==
Following the crash, Vulović spent days in a coma, having fractured her skull and suffering a cerebral haemorrhage. She also suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović&#x27;s parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquillized. The last thing that Vulović could remember from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded. The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.

Vulović underwent treatment in a Prague hospital until 12 March 1972, after which she was flown to Belgrade. She was offered a hypnotic injection to help her sleep during the flight back to Yugoslavia, but declined, explaining that she was not afraid of flying because she had no memory of the crash. In Belgrade, Vulović&#x27;s hospital room was placed under 24-hour police protection because authorities feared that the perpetrators of the bombing would wish to kill her. The guards changed shifts every six hours, and no one was allowed in to see her except for her parents and doctors. Vulović&#x27;s hospitalization lasted until June 1972, after which she travelled to Montenegro to recuperate at a seaside resort, where her doctors visited her every two or three days. 

Vulović underwent several operations to restore her movement. At first, she could only move her left leg, and one month thereafter, she was able to move her right. Within ten months of her fall, Vulović had regained the ability to walk, but limped for the rest of her life, her spine permanently twisted. In total, she spent sixteen months recuperating. &quot;Nobody ever expected me to live this long,&quot; she recounted in 2008. Vulović attributed her recovery to her &quot;Serbian stubbornness&quot; and &quot;a childhood diet that included chocolate, spinach, and fish oil&quot;. A year after the accident, she was planning on using insurance payments to help her parents to purchase a car, after they had to sell their old one to cover some debt.

==Fame==

In September 1972, Vulović expressed willingness to resume working as a flight attendant. JAT felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. In Yugoslavia, she was celebrated as a national hero. Her reputation as a &quot;Cold War heroine&quot; also extended to the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. After the crash, Vulović was honoured by Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, and the Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song titled &quot;Vesna stjuardesa&quot; (&quot;Vesna the Stewardess&quot;). She was soon made an honorary citizen of Srbská Kamenice. Honke, the man who found Vulović alive after the crash, had a granddaughter born six weeks after her fall; she was named Vesna in Vulović&#x27;s honour. Vulović continued to fly regularly, stating that other passengers were surprised to see her on flights and wanted to sit next to her.

Vulović&#x27;s parents both died within a few years of the crash. In 1977, she married mechanical engineer Nikola Breka after a year of dating. Although she was advised by physicians that her injuries would not have an adverse effect on her reproductive function, Vulović experienced an ectopic pregnancy that nearly proved fatal and was never able to have children. In 1985, &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; recognized Vulović as the world record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute: . She was thus officially acknowledged as having surpassed the records of other fall survivors, such as Alan Magee, Juliane Koepcke, Nicholas Alkemade, and Ivan Chisov. She received the recognition at a London gala from musician Paul McCartney.

In the early 1990s, Vulović and her husband divorced. She attributed the divorce to her chain smoking, which her husband disapproved of. Around the same time, Vulović was fired from JAT for speaking out against Serbian statesman Slobodan Milošević and taking part in anti-government protests. She avoided arrest because the government was concerned about the negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. In response to her activism, pro-Milošević tabloids launched a smear campaign against her, claiming that Flight 367 had been shot down by a Czechoslovak surface-to-air missile and that she had fallen from a lesser height than previously believed. Vulović continued taking part in anti-government demonstrations throughout the 1990s. When Milošević and his Socialist Party of Serbia were ousted in the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000, Vulović was among several celebrities who took to the balcony of Belgrade&#x27;s city hall to make victory addresses. She later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party and advocated for Serbia&#x27;s entry into the European Union, which she believed would bring economic prosperity.

==Later life and death==
Vulović told reporters that she did not think of her fall every day, but admitted to struggling with survivor&#x27;s guilt. &quot;Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry ... Then I think maybe I should not have survived at all.&quot; Vulović declined therapy to help cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. &quot;If you can survive what I survived,&quot; she said, &quot;you can survive anything.&quot;

In 2009, Peter Hornung and Pavel Theiner, two Prague-based journalists, claimed that Flight 367 had been mistaken for an enemy aircraft and shot down by the Czechoslovak Air Force at an altitude of , far lower than the official altitude of . The two claimed that the Czechoslovak State Security had conjured up Vulović&#x27;s record fall as part of a cover-up. They also hypothesized that the call received by &quot;Kvällsposten&quot;, claiming responsibility for the aircraft&#x27;s downing, was a hoax. The Czech Civil Aviation Authority dismissed the journalists&#x27; claim, calling it a conspiracy theory. Hornung conceded that the pair&#x27;s evidence was only circumstantial. Vulović said that she was aware of the journalists&#x27; claims, but stated that because she had no memory of the event, she could not confirm or deny the allegations. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; continues to list her as the record-holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute.

In the last years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her Belgrade apartment. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say when people say I was lucky,&quot; she remarked. &quot;Life is so hard today.&quot; Vulović lamented that her mother and father might not have died prematurely had she not been aboard Flight 367, stating that the incident not only ruined her life but also those of her parents. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC, saying that she was &quot;tired&quot; of discussing her fall. By the time she had reached her sixties, Vulović&#x27;s deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. 

In December 2016, Vulović&#x27;s friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering telephone calls. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered her body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović&#x27;s friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade&#x27;s New Cemetery on 27 December.

<text>Rostov-Yaroslavsky (until 1904 was known as Rostov) is the passenger railway station in Rostov (Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia) and a stop along the Trans-Siberian Railway.

== History ==
The station was opened in 1870 on the Alexandrov - Yaroslavl section. The first train from Moscow to Rostov ran January 1 (13), 1870.

In 1958, during the electrification of the Alexandrov - Yaroslavl-Glavny section, the station was electrified with 3 kV direct current.

In October 2020, a high-speed train &quot;Lastochka&quot; running from Moscow to Kostroma began to stop at Rostov-Yaroslavsky station, with the travel time of 2 hour 17 minutes from Moscow.

== Terminal ==
The station&#x27;s appearance has changed several times over its long history. Old-timers still remember a small wooden structure with a stone central part - a waiting room and two-storey wings connected by a gallery.

The modern building of the station was built in 1975. The townspeople call it a &quot;ship&quot; for its resemblance to a large ocean liner, miraculously moored near the railroad tracks. Above the station towers a spire with a rook, the symbol of the city. The building is U-shaped and has 2 floors. The average height of the main premises is 3.35 m, the height of the lobby and hall is 8 m. The total area of the building by internal measurement is 1881.8 m2.

== Activities ==
The station is open for cargo operations.

Commercial operations performed at the station:

* sale of passenger tickets
* acceptance and delivery of luggage
* acceptance and delivery of wagonload consignments of cargo (open platforms)
* receipt and delivery of small consignments of goods (covered warehouses)
* receipt and delivery of wagonload and small consignments of cargo (sidings)
* receipt and delivery of wagonload consignments of cargo (covered warehouses)
* receipt and delivery of cargo in general-purpose containers (3 and 5 tons)
* reception and dispatch of cargo in general-purpose containers (20 tons)
* reception and delivery of small consignments (open yards)

<text>On March 16, 2004, an explosion destroyed a corner section of a nine-storey Soviet-era apartment building in Arkhangelsk, Russia. It happened at 3:03 a.m. local time (UTC +3). The explosion occurred in 120 Avenue of the Soviet Cosmonauts in the October district (&quot;Oktyabrskiy rayon&quot;) of Arkhangelsk.

The death toll from the explosion was 58 (33 women, 16 men and 9 children). Two of the dead succumbed to their wounds in a hospital after being rescued.

The explosion came two days after Vladimir Putin won reelection and several weeks after a suicide bombing killed 41 Moscow Metro passengers.

In April 2004, authorities arrested and charged 26-year-old former employee of city gas services Sergey Alekseychik. On December 16, 2005, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. According to the official version, Alekseychik was fired from his natural gas technician job several days prior to the explosion, and to get even with his former employers and the city, he sabotaged the gas system thus causing the tragedy.

<text>Radley College, formally St Peter&#x27;s College, Radley or the College of St. Peter at Radley, is a public school (independent boarding school) for boys near the village of Radley, in Oxfordshire, in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1847. The school covers including playing fields, a golf course, a lake, and farmland. Before the counties of England were re-organised, the school was in Berkshire.

Radley is one of only four public schools to have retained the boys-only, boarding-only tradition, the others being Sherborne, Harrow and Eton. Formerly this group included Winchester, although the latter school is currently undergoing a transition to co-ed status. Of the seven public schools addressed by the Public Schools Act 1868 four have since become co-educational: Rugby (1976), Charterhouse (1971), Westminster (1973), and Shrewsbury (2014). For the academic year 2022/23, Radley charged boarders up to £14,850 per term, or £44,550 per annum. It is a member of the Rugby Group.

== History ==

Radley was founded in 1847 by William Sewell (1804–79) and Robert Corbet Singleton (1810–81). The first pupil was Samuel Reynolds, who in 1897 wrote his reminiscences of school life.

The school was originally housed in Radley Hall, now known as &quot;Mansion&quot;. Radley Hall was built in the 1720s for the Stonehouse family. Later in the 18th century the estate passed to the Bowyer family, who commissioned Capability Brown to re-design the grounds. After the school was founded, extensive building work took place, beginning with Chapel (replaced by the current building in 1895), F Social and Octagon (the earliest living accommodation for the boys), Clock Tower, and in 1910 the dining hall (Hall). Building work has continued throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, with three new Socials, a weights-room/gym, a rowing tank, a theatre, and a real tennis court being completed since 2006. The Science Block was also expanded and refurbished in 2019. The grounds include a lake, a golf course and woodland.

On 31 August 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that a whistleblower had suggested that teachers had helped their students in an art GCSE exam. Investigations by the exam board found no fault beyond a minor technical breach of exam regulations. Radley College issued a statement expressing full support for staff and procedures both within the art department and across the school.

On 6 July 2018, pupils hired a plane to tow a banner reading &quot;Make Radley Great Again&quot; over the school, reportedly in response to changes to the school branding and staff during John Moule&#x27;s time as warden.

== School terms ==
There are three academic terms in the year:

* The Michaelmas term, from early September to mid-December.
* The Lent term, from early January to late March.
* The Summer term, from mid-April to late June or early July.

== Radley formalities ==

Radley College has its own specialised terminology and formalities, similar to the notions of Winchester College. For example, all teachers are referred to as &quot;dons&quot;, and female teachers and members of staff are addressed only as &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;; the headmaster is known as the &quot;warden&quot;; boarding houses are known as &quot;socials&quot;, with their masters being known as &quot;tutors&quot; and their head prefects as &quot;pups&quot;; ties earned by pups, top sportsmen, and other distinguished boys have flat bottoms and are known as &quot;strings&quot; (&quot;social strings&quot; if earned for distinction within the social, &quot;college strings&quot; if earned for distinction within the wider college); and the five year-groups, from first to last, are called &quot;shell&quot;, &quot;remove&quot;, &quot;fifth&quot;, &quot;6.1&quot;, and &quot;6.2&quot;. During the Michaelmas and Lent terms, gowns are worn over uniforms, while during the summer term, shirts are worn without ties, jackets, or gowns (known as &quot;Summer Dress&quot; or, more officially, as &quot;Shirt-Sleeve Order&quot;). A formal house meeting is held once a week, known as &quot;social prayers&quot; (an assembly usually with a talk or presentation); an informal house meeting with food, known as &quot;cocoa&quot;, takes place every evening; a weekend which a boy would usually stay in school for but has been allowed to leave on is known as a &quot;privi&quot; (short for &quot;privilege weekend&quot; as these can be cancelled if a boy is subject to disciplinary proceedings); and the final day of the academic year is known as &quot;gaudy&quot;, from the Latin meaning &quot;rejoice thou&quot;.

== Socials ==
There are 11 socials at Radley, each housing approximately 70 boys and distinguished by the colours of their members&#x27; ties. They are each known by a single letter, although they are formally named after their tutor (e.g., H, formally May&#x27;s Social). When the college opened, most boys were living together in College, but they were under the care of six &quot;social tutors&quot; and the term &quot;social&quot; then referred to all the boys under the care of one tutor. When D Social was built in 1886 all the boys and their tutor were united in their own living quarters and so the word &quot;social&quot; came to mean the building and all of its inhabitants. Similar to Eton&#x27;s houses and their dames, each social at Radley has a matron known as the &quot;PHM&quot; (&quot;pastoral housemistress&quot;), whose role is central.
==Academic aspects==
The school was inspected by the independent schools&#x27; Inspectorate in February 2008. The inspection report rated the school&#x27;s standard of education as &quot;outstanding&quot;, the highest rating. There was a subsequent inspection by ISI in 2013.

In 2012, the Independent review of A level results, based on government issued statistics, ranked Radley 31st in the UK, ahead of Malvern (32nd), Harrow (34th), Winchester (73rd), Tonbridge (74th), Eton (80th) and Wellington (89th) By 2019 they were still in the top 100 but had dropped to 75th place.

==Sports==
Sports played at the College are rugby football in the Michaelmas Term, hockey, rowing and football in the Lent Term and cricket, rowing, lawn tennis, and athletics in the Summer Term.

Other sports played include badminton, basketball, beagling, cross-country, fencing, fives, lacrosse, rackets, real tennis, rugby sevens, squash, water polo and sailing.

===Rugby===
Rugby is the major sport of the Michaelmas term. The school fields 23 rugby teams on most Saturdays of the Michaelmas term and on some Thursdays. The Master in charge of Rugby is Gloucester loose-head prop Nick Wood, OR.

===Rowing===

Radley is recognised for its rowing, having won events at Henley Royal Regatta on 6 occasions. Only Eton, St Paul&#x27;s, Shrewsbury, and St Edward&#x27;s have won more events at the Regatta.

===Cricket===
Cricket is played in the summer term. Some Old Radleians have progressed to play cricket for England or captain county level cricket teams.

===Field hockey===

Eighteen hockey teams are fielded during the Lent term. Teams train on three Astroturf pitches and a full-sized indoor hockey pitch. Radley takes part in the Independent Schools Hockey League.

===Football===

Twelve football teams are fielded in the Lent term. Radley competes in ISFA Southern Independent Schools Lent Term League. There is a yearly pre-season training camp before term starts.

===Other sports===
Sports such as fives, rackets, sailing, badminton, and polo are represented, as well as scuba diving. A real tennis court opened in July 2008, which made Radley the only school in the world to have fives, squash, badminton, tennis, racquets, and real tennis courts all on campus.

==Southern Railway Schools Class==

The school lent its name to a steam locomotive (Engine 930; &quot;Radley&quot;) of Southern Railway&#x27;s Class V (&quot;Schools&quot;), which were named for English public schools. 
Built in 1934 and withdrawn in 1962, the nameplate from 930 is now displayed in the college&#x27;s shop.

===Price-fixing cartel case (2005)===
In 2005 Radley College was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were found guilty by the Office of Fair Trading of running an illegal price-fixing cartel which had allowed them to drive up fees. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £21,360 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a Trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. In their defence, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had previously been exempt from the anti-cartel rules applied to business; they were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with one another and they were unaware of the current law.

<doc id="531340" wikidata="Q1514715" url="?curid=531340" title="Matsubayashi-ryū">
<text>Matsubayashi-Ryū (松林流), is a style of Okinawan karate founded in 1947 by Shōshin Nagamine (1907–1997) (an Okina Sensei). Its curriculum includes 18 kata, seven two-man yakusoku kumite (pre-arranged sparring) routines, and kobudō (weapons) practice.

Nagamine named his style in honor of the two most important masters that his teachings were based upon: Sōkon Matsumura of Shuri-te, and Kosaku Matsumora of Tomari-te. He chose to name the school using the first kanji characters from both master&#x27;s names Matsu (松) and the style is pronounced in Japanese &quot;Matsubayashi&quot;. Matsubayashi-ryū is a style of Shōrin-ryū and the terms Matsubayashi-ryū and Shōrin-ryū can be used interchangeably. Normally, the style is referred to as Shōrin-ryū, but when a definite distinction is required between the other styles of the Shōrin-ryū family (Kobayashi Shōrin-ryū, Shōbayashi Shōrin-ryū and Matsumura Seito Hohan Sōken) then it is called Matsubayashi-ryū. Nagamine also credited Motobu Chōki as the teacher who inspired his seven Yakusoku Kumite Forms.

Matsubayashi-ryū is one of the better-documented traditional karate styles, owing to Nagamine&#x27;s book, &quot;The Essence of Okinawan Karate-dō&quot;. as well as &quot;Tales of Okinawa&#x27;s Great Masters&quot;. Takayoshi Nagamine

After the death of Nagamine O Sensei in 1997, many of his senior students formed their own organisations to teach Matsubayashi-ryū. In the years following Nagamine Soke, continued to lead the organization, but was unable to get unification, due to politics within the organization. Since 2012, Yoshitaka Taira has been the association president. There are now, many other organizations which are continuing the teachings of O Sensei outside of the WMKA.
