<text>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons [1996 ICJ 3] is a landmark international law case, where the International Court of Justice gave an advisory opinion stating that while the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to international humanitarian law, it cannot be concluded whether or not such a threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful in extreme circumstances where the very survival of a state would be at stake. The Court held that there is no source of international law that explicitly authorises or prohibits the threat or use of nuclear weapons but such threat or use must be in conformity with the UN Charter and principles of international humanitarian law. The Court also concluded that there was a general obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament.

The World Health Organization requested the opinion on 3 September 1993, but it was initially refused because the WHO was acting outside its legal capacity (&quot;ultra vires&quot;). So the United Nations General Assembly requested another opinion in December 1994, accepted by the Court in January 1995. As well as determining the illegality of nuclear weapon use, the court discussed the proper role of international judicial bodies, the ICJ&#x27;s advisory function, international humanitarian law (&quot;jus in bello&quot;), and rules governing the use of force (&quot;jus ad bellum&quot;). It explored the status of &quot;&quot;Lotus&quot; approach&quot;, and employed the concept of &quot;non liquet&quot;. There were also strategic questions such as the legality of the practice of nuclear deterrence or the meaning of Article VI of the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

The possibility of threat outlawing use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict was raised on 30 June 1950, by the Dutch representative to the International Law Commission (ILC), , who suggested this &quot;would in itself be an advance&quot;. In addition, the Polish government requested this issue to be examined by the ILC as a crime against the peace of mankind. However, the issue was delayed during the Cold War.

The new Start Treaty is an agreement by both the US and Russian governments to limit the deploying of nuclear ballistic missiles. Being signed in 2010 and started in force back on February 5, 2011, had the Russian government seven years to meet the requirements set by the treaty. The treaty was extended in 2021 for another five years till 2026.

==Request of the World Health Organization==

An advisory opinion on this issue was originally requested by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 3 September 1993:

The ICJ considered the WHO&#x27;s request, in a case known as the &quot;Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict&quot; (General List No. 93), and also known as the &quot;WHO Nuclear Weapons case&quot;, between 1993 and 1996. The ICJ fixed 10 June 1994 as the time limit for written submissions, but after receiving many written and oral submissions, later extended this date to 20 September 1994. After considering the case the Court refused to give an advisory opinion on the WHO question. On 8 July 1996 it held, by 11 votes to three, that the question did not fall within the scope of WHO&#x27;s activities, as is required by Article 96(2) of the UN Charter.

==Request of the UN General Assembly==

On 15 December 1994 the UN General Assembly adopted resolution A/RES/49/75K. This asked the ICJ urgently to render its advisory opinion on the following question:
The resolution, submitted to the Court on 19 December 1994, was adopted by 78 states voting in favour, 43 against, 38 abstaining and 26 not voting.

The General Assembly had considered asking a similar question in the autumn of 1993, at the instigation of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which ultimately did not push its request that year. NAM was more willing the following year, in the face of written statements submitted in the WHO proceedings from a number of nuclear-weapon states indicating strong views to the effect that the WHO lacked competence in the matter. The Court subsequently fixed 20 June 1995 as the filing date for written statements.

Altogether, 42 states participated in the written phase of the pleadings, the largest number ever to join in proceedings before the Court. Of the five declared nuclear weapon states (the P5), only the People&#x27;s Republic of China did not participate. Of the three &quot;threshold&quot; nuclear-weapon states, only India participated. Many of the participants were developing states which had not previously contributed to proceedings before the ICJ, a reflection perhaps of the unparalleled interest in this matter and the growing willingness of developing states to engage in international judicial proceedings in the &quot;post-colonial&quot; period.

Oral hearings were held from 30 October to 15 November 1995. Twenty-two states participated: Australia, Egypt, France, Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, Iran, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Qatar, Russian Federation, San Marino, Samoa, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Costa Rica, United Kingdom, United States, Zimbabwe; as did the WHO. The secretariat of the UN did not appear, but filed with the Court a dossier explaining the history of resolution 49/75K. Each state was allocated 90 minutes to make its statement. On 8 July 1996, nearly eight months after the close of the oral phase, the ICJ rendered its opinion.

== Decision of the International Court of Justice ==

===Composition of the Court===

The ICJ is composed of fifteen judges elected to nine year terms by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. The court&#x27;s &quot;advisory opinion&quot; can be requested only by specific United Nations organisations, and is inherently non-binding under the Statute of the court.

The fifteen judges asked to give their advisory opinion regarding the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons were:

===Court&#x27;s analysis===

====Deterrence and &quot;threat&quot;====
The court considered the matter of deterrence, which involves a &quot;threat&quot; to use nuclear weapons under certain circumstances on a potential enemy or an enemy. Was such a threat illegal? The court decided, with some judges dissenting, that, if a threatened retaliatory strike was consistent with military necessity and proportionality, it would not necessarily be illegal. (Judgement paragraphs 37–50)

====The legality of the possession of nuclear weapons====
The court then considered the legality of the possession, as opposed to actual use, of nuclear weapons. The Court looked at various treaties, including the UN Charter, and found no treaty language that specifically forbade the possession of nuclear weapons in a categorical way.

The UN Charter was examined in paragraphs 37–50 (paragraph 37: &quot;The Court will now address the question of the legality or illegality of recourse to nuclear weapons in the light of the provisions of the Charter relating to the threat or use of force&quot;). Paragraph 39 mentions: &quot;These provisions [i.e. those of the Charter] do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed. The Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon, including nuclear weapons. A weapon that is already unlawful &quot;per se&quot;, whether by treaty or custom, does not become lawful by reason of its being used for a legitimate purpose under the Charter.&quot;

Treaties were examined in paragraphs 53–63 (paragraph 53: &quot;The Court must therefore now examine whether there is any prohibition of recourse to nuclear weapons as such; it will first ascertain whether there is a conventional prescription to this effect&quot;), as part of the law applicable in situations of armed conflict (paragraph 51, first sentence: &quot;Having dealt with the Charter provisions relating to the threat or use of force, the Court will now turn to the law applicable in situations of armed conflict&quot;). In particular, with respect to &quot;the argument [that] has been advanced that nuclear weapons should be treated in the same way as poisoned weapons&quot;, the Court concluded that &quot;it does not seem to the Court that the use of nuclear weapons can be regarded as specifically prohibited on the basis of the [...] provisions of the Second Hague Declaration of 1899, the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention IV of 1907 or the 1925 Protocol&quot; (paragraphs 54 and 56)&quot;. It was also argued by some that the Hague Conventions concerning the use of bacteriological or chemical weapons would also apply to nuclear weapons, but the Court was unable to adopt this argument (&quot;The Court does not find any specific prohibition of recourse to nuclear weapons in treaties expressly prohibiting the use of certain weapons of mass destruction&quot;, paragraph 57 &quot;in fine&quot;).

With respect to treaties that &quot;deal [...] exclusively with acquisition, manufacture, possession, deployment and testing of nuclear weapons, without specifically addressing their threat or use,&quot; the Court notes that those treaties &quot;certainly point to an increasing concern in the international community with these weapons; the Court concludes from this that these treaties could therefore be seen as foreshadowing a future general prohibition of the use of such weapons, but they do not constitute such a prohibition by themselves&quot; (paragraph 62). Also, regarding &quot;regional&quot; treaties prohibiting resource, namely those of Tlatelolco (Latin America) and Rarotonga (South Pacific) the Court notes that while those &quot;testify to a growing awareness of the need to liberate the community of States and the international public from the dangers resulting from the existence of nuclear weapons&quot;, &quot;[i]t [i.e. the Court] does not, however, view these elements as amounting to a comprehensive and universal conventional prohibition on the use, or the threat of use, of those weapons as such.&quot; (paragraph 63).

Customary international law also provided insufficient evidence that the possession of nuclear weapons had come to be universally regarded as illegal.

Ultimately, the court was unable to find an &quot;opinio juris&quot; (that is, legal consensus) that nuclear weapons are illegal to possess. (paragraph 65) However, in practice, nuclear weapons have not been used in war since 1945 and there have been numerous UN resolutions condemning their use (however, such resolutions are not universally supported—most notably, the nuclear powers object to them).(paragraph 68–73) The ICJ did not find that these facts demonstrated a new and clear customary law absolutely forbidding nuclear weapons.

However, there are many universal humanitarian laws applying to war. For instance, it is illegal for a combatant specifically to target civilians and certain types of weapons that cause indiscriminate damage are categorically outlawed. All states seem to observe these rules, making them a part of customary international law, so the court ruled that these laws would also apply to the use of nuclear weapons.(paragraph 86) The Court decided not to pronounce on the matter of whether the use of nuclear weapons might possibly be legal, if exercised as a last resort in extreme circumstances (such as if the very existence of the state was in jeopardy).(paragraph 97)

=== Decision ===
The court undertook seven separate votes, all of which were passed:

#The court decided to comply with the request for an advisory opinion;
#The court replied that &quot;There is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons&quot;;
#The court replied that &quot;There is in neither customary nor conventional international law any comprehensive and universal prohibition of the threat or use of nuclear weapons as such&quot;;
#The court replied that &quot;A threat or use of force by means of nuclear weapons that is contrary to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter and that fails to meet all the requirements of Article 51, is unlawful&quot;;
#The court replied that &quot;A threat or use of nuclear weapons should also be compatible with the requirements of the international law applicable in armed conflict, particularly those of the principles and rules of humanitarian law, as well as with specific obligations under treaties and other undertakings which expressly deal with nuclear weapons&quot;
#The court replied that &quot;the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law; However, in view of the current state of international law, and of the elements of fact at its disposal, the Court cannot conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake&quot;
#The court replied that &quot;There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control&quot;.

The court voted as follows:

====Split decision====
The only significantly split decision was on the matter of whether &quot;the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict&quot;, not including &quot;in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake&quot;. However, three of the seven &quot;dissenting&quot; judges (namely, Judge Shahabuddeen of Guyana, Judge Weeramantry of Sri Lanka, and Judge Koroma of Sierra Leone) wrote separate opinions explaining that the reason they were dissenting was their view that there is no exception under any circumstances (&quot;including&quot; that of ensuring the survival of a State) to the general principle that use of nuclear weapons is illegal. A fourth dissenter, Judge Oda of Japan, dissented largely on the ground that the Court simply should not have taken the case.

Vice President Schwebel remarked in his dissenting opinion that

And Higgins noted that she did not

Nevertheless, the Court&#x27;s opinion did not conclude definitively and categorically, under the existing state of international law at the time, whether in an extreme circumstance of self-defence in which the very survival of a State would be a stake, the threat or use of nuclear weapons would necessarily be unlawful in all possible cases. However, the court&#x27;s opinion unanimously clarified that the world&#x27;s states have a binding duty to negotiate in good faith, and to accomplish, nuclear disarmament.

==International reaction==
===United Kingdom===

The Government of the United Kingdom has announced plans to renew Britain&#x27;s only nuclear weapon, the Trident missile system. They have published a white paper &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Nuclear Deterrent&quot; in which they state that the renewal is fully compatible with the United Kingdom&#x27;s treaty commitments and international law. These arguments are summarised in a question and answer briefing published by UK Permanent Representative to the Conference on Disarmament
The white paper &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Nuclear Deterrent&quot; stands in contrast to two legal opinions. The first, commissioned by Peacerights, was given on 19 December 2005 by Rabinder Singh QC and Professor Christine Chinkin of Matrix Chambers. It addressed
Drawing on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinion, Singh and Chinkin argued that:
The second legal opinion was commissioned by Greenpeace and given by Philippe Sands QC and Helen Law, also of Matrix Chambers, on 13 November 2006. The opinion addressed

With regards to the &quot;jus ad bellum&quot;, Sands and Law found that

The phrase &quot;very survival of the state&quot; is a direct quote from paragraph 97 of the ICJ ruling. With regards to international humanitarian law, they found that

Finally, with reference to the NPT, Sands and Law found that

===Scots law===

In 1999 a legal case was put forward to attempt to use the ICJ&#x27;s Opinion in establishing the illegality of nuclear weapons.

On 27 September 1999, three Trident Ploughshares activists Ulla Røder from Denmark, Angie Zelter from England, and Ellen Moxley from Scotland, were acquitted of charges of malicious damage at Greenock Sheriff Court. The three women had boarded &quot;Maytime&quot;, a barge moored in Loch Goil and involved in scientific work connected with the s berthed in the nearby Gareloch, and caused £80,000 worth of damage. As is often the case in trials relating to such actions, the defendants attempted to establish that their actions were necessary, in that they had prevented what they saw as &quot;nuclear crime&quot;.

The acquittal of the Trident Three resulted in the High Court of Justiciary, the supreme criminal court in Scots law, considering a Lord Advocate&#x27;s Reference, and presenting the first detailed analysis of the ICJ Opinion by another judicial body. The High Court was asked to answer four questions:

#In a trial under Scottish criminal procedure, is it competent to lead evidence as to the content of customary international law as it applies in the United Kingdom?
#Does any rule of customary international law justify a private individual in Scotland in damaging or destroying property in pursuit of his or her objection to the United Kingdom&#x27;s possession of nuclear weapons, its action in placing such weapons at locations within Scotland or its policies in relation to such weapons?
#Does the belief of an accused person that his or her actions are justified in law constitute a defence to a charge of malicious mischief or theft?
#Is it a general defence to a criminal charge that the offence was committed in order to prevent or bring to an end the commission of an offence by another person?

The four collective answers given by Lord Prosser, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Penrose were all negative. This did not have the effect of overturning the acquittals of Roder, Zelter and Moxley (Scots law, like many other jurisdictions, does not allow for an acquittal to be appealed); however, it does have the effect of invalidating the &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; under which the three women were able to argue for their acquittal, and ensures that similar defences cannot be present in Scots Law.

<doc id="512076" wikidata="Q1182593" url="?curid=512076" title="Defender (1981 video game)">
<text>Defender is a 1981 horizontally scrolling shooter video game developed by Williams Electronics for arcades. The game is set on either an unnamed planet or city (depending on platform) where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; &quot;Defender&quot; was Jarvis&#x27;s first video game project and drew inspiration from &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Asteroids&quot;. &quot;Defender&quot; was demonstrated in late 1980 and was released in March 1981. It was distributed in Japan by Taito.

&quot;Defender&quot; was one of the most important titles of the golden age of arcade video games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company&#x27;s best-selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game&#x27;s audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis&#x27;s best contributions to the video game industry and one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of horizontal scrolling shoot &#x27;em ups. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.

Ports were developed for contemporary game systems, most of them by either Atari, Inc. or its software label for non-Atari platforms, Atarisoft. The 1982 Atari 2600 version was one of the best-selling games for the system and sold over 3 million cartridges.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Defender&quot; is a side-view, horizontally scrolling shooter set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a spaceship flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship&#x27;s elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The player starts with three &quot;smart bombs&quot;, which destroy all visible enemies. As a last resort, the &quot;hyperspace&quot; button works as in &quot;Asteroids&quot;: the player&#x27;s ship reappears in a random—possibly unsafe—location. Players are allotted three ships at the start of the game; another ship and smart bomb are awarded every 10,000 points (adjustable per machine). Two players can alternate turns.

The object is to destroy all alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Landers pick up humans and attempt to carry them to the top of the screen at which point they turn into fast-moving mutants. A captured human can be freed by shooting the lander, then catching the human before it falls to its death, and dropping it off on the ground.

Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy or its projectiles, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.

== Development ==
&quot;Defender&quot; was Williams Electronics&#x27; first attempt at developing a new video game; the company&#x27;s earlier game was a &quot;Pong&quot; clone. The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams pinball games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded a large amount of creative freedom.

=== Initial development ===
Space was a popular setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the abstract setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4 months developing color variations of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and Atari, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot;. First inspired by &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot;, but hardware differences between &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;″s proposed specifications were problematic. &quot;Asteroids&quot; displays vector graphics on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics, but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.

Believing their first attempts to be too derivative, the developers held brainstorming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of &quot;Asteroids&quot;″s favorable elements was its wraparound. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game&#x27;s environment was made longer than the screen and scrolled horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; rotated 90 degrees. By changing the orientation of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;″ design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from &quot;Asteroids&quot;, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game should be able to scroll in either direction.

After six months of development, the team felt the game had not made enough progress. They examined other games and concluded that survival was a necessary component to implement. To achieve this, they devised enemies to present a threat, the first of which was the &quot;Lander&quot;. Jarvis enjoyed violent, action entertainment, and wanted the game to have those elements, but felt the action should have a reasonable objective. Inspired by the 1960s television show &quot;The Defenders&quot;, Jarvis titled the game &quot;Defender&quot;, reasoning that the title helped justify the violence. He added astronauts to expand on the space theme and give players something to defend while they shot enemies. The element of flying over a planetscape was added after a brainstorming session between Jarvis and Ritchie. The landscape is depicted as a line only a pixel wide, primarily because the hardware was not powerful enough to generate anything more detailed.

=== Later development ===
By July, development was behind schedule and Jarvis&#x27;s superior began to pressure him to finish the game in time for a then-upcoming trade show, the AMOA, in September. Jarvis spent several weeks creating the astronauts, which his boss felt should be omitted if the process didn&#x27;t speed up. The pressure frustrated him to the point he considered resigning. Around that time, a new programmer named Sam Dicker was hired. He assisted in programming the game and added visual and audio effects. For example, Dicker implemented a particle effect algorithm to generate unique explosions for destroyed enemies. The new elements re-invigorated Jarvis, who felt the project began to show promise.

Development then shifted focus to the enemies. Landers were given the ability to capture humans, and a new enemy was devised from the mechanic: &quot;Mutants&quot;, captured humans that had turned hostile. The Mutants added a rescue element to the game that Jarvis believed made it more interesting to players and encouraged them to continue playing. The element of making a &quot;comeback&quot; from a dire situation was applied to the planet as well. Jarvis felt it mimicked the ups and downs of real life. &quot;Bombers&quot;, enemies which release floating bombs on the screen, were added next. More enemies were added to create different gameplay elements. &quot;Swarmers&quot; and &quot;Pods&quot; were designed to attack the spaceship as opposed to the astronauts. &quot;Baiters&quot; were included to add pressure to the player by preventing them from lingering. The enemies quickly follow the spaceship to collide with it, and were based on a similar enemy in &quot;Asteroids&quot;.

By September, the game was still unfinished, and almost every Williams programmer assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode (an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play) and high score system for the game, and began working on them that night. DeMar coded the attract mode, Dussault and Dicker created the high score table, and Jarvis playtested and fixed bugs. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in a cabinet. The chips were put in backwards, causing an electrical short when the cabinet was turned on, so the team had to quickly burn a new set of EPROMs. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes to prepare for the show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game&#x27;s difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis&#x27;s score of 60,000 points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.

=== Hardware ===
The game features amplified monaural sound and pixel graphics on a CRT monitor. A Motorola 6809 central processing unit handles the graphics and gameplay, while a Motorola 6800 microprocessor handles the audio. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game&#x27;s settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork is stenciled on the wooden frame.

Development started by focusing on the game&#x27;s hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black-and-white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4 colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16 colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than they would ever need for a game. The monitor&#x27;s resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then-industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game&#x27;s presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.

The game&#x27;s control scheme uses a two-way joystick and five buttons. Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Asteroids&quot; simultaneously. The player&#x27;s left hand manipulates the joystick similar to &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and the right hand pushes buttons similar to &quot;Asteroids&quot;. The button functions to shoot projectiles and accelerate use a similar layout to &quot;Asteroids&quot;. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.

== Reception ==
===Commercial performance===
The game was slow to gain popularity, not attracting much attention at the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game was well received in arcades, and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. &quot;Defender&quot; eventually became Williams&#x27; best-selling arcade game, with over 55,000 units sold worldwide, and it became one of the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1 billion. It has sold 70,000 arcade units as of 2020, and grossed over worldwide as of 2000. In Japan, &quot;Defender&quot; was not as highly successful. It tied with &quot;Turbo&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot; as Japan&#x27;s 18th highest-grossing arcade video game of 1981.

Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. On the 1981 arcade game charts, it topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade chart in August, and the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts for most months between April and November. The annual &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts listed &quot;Defender&quot; as the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1981 in the United States, just below &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) later listed &quot;Defender&quot; among America&#x27;s six highest-grossing arcade games of 1982.

Co-designer Larry Demar was surprised by the game&#x27;s popularity. At the time of its release, Stan Jarocki, director of marketing at then-competitor Midway Manufacturing, described the game as &quot;amazing&quot;.

The Atari VCS port sold over copies, becoming the second best-selling Atari home video game of 1982 (just below the Atari version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;). However, at least 68,993 copies of &quot;Defender&quot; were returned in 1983. Across all home platforms, the game has sold over 5 million cartridges worldwide as of 2000.

===Reviews===
&quot;Softline&quot; in 1983 wrote that it &quot;remains one of the hardest arcade games ever developed. Initial attempts lasting less than ten seconds are not uncommon for novices&quot;. In his 1981 video game guide &quot;How to Master the Video Games&quot; Tom Hirschfeld reported &quot;Mastering DEFENDER requires some perserverance, but most players find the effort worthwhile&quot;.

Ed Driscoll reviewed the Atari 2600 version of &quot;Defender&quot; (where, due to its graphical limitations, was reformatted to a city setting, rather than the planet setting of the original arcade version) in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 57. Driscoll commented that &quot;all in all, if you want a good game for your Atari, this qualifies. &quot;Defender&quot; lovers have a few gripes, but I would recommend this one to any VCS owner&quot;. The port won the &quot;Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Videogame&quot; category in the 1983 Arcade Awards. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; later reviewed the game, giving it a 90% rating.

In 1983 &quot;Softline&quot; readers named the port for the Atari 8-bit computers fifth on the magazine&#x27;s Top Thirty list of Atari programs by popularity. The magazine was more critical, stating that &quot;the game&#x27;s appeal does not justify its unreasonable cost&quot; of being shipped on ROM cartridges. David H. Ahl of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; said in 1983 that the Atari 5200 version was &quot;a substantial challenge to the most seasoned space gamers&quot;. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine reviewed the IBM PC conversion, giving it a mixed review. They said the &quot;action is very fast&quot; but &quot;it becomes boring after a short time.&quot;

===Retrospective===
In 1995, Flux magazine rated Defender 34th in its Top 100 Video Games. They lauded the game stating: &quot;the ultimate side scrolling arcade shooter.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked the arcade version as number 13 on their 1996 &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that its balanced difficulty makes gamers keep coming back for more instead of giving up. In 1996, GamesMaster listed the game number 5 in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, they described the game as &quot;One of the greatest shoot-‘em-ups of all time.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Defender&quot; as number 23 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;despite exceptionally complicated controls, gamers fell in love at first sight. The difficulty is high but fair - when you die, it&#x27;s always your fault, and that leaves you wanting one more chance to beat the game&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Defender&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the number six arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. That same year, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; rated the game number ten on their list of &quot;Top 25 Arcade Games&quot;, citing it as a technical achievement and a difficult title with addictive gameplay. Also in 2008, &quot;Edge&quot; ranked &quot;Defender&quot; the sixth best game from the 1980s. The editors described its design as very &quot;elegant&quot; despite a lack of narrative and characters.

GameSpy&#x27;s David Cuciz lauded &quot;Defender&quot;″s challenging gameplay, commenting that it is representative of what other games should be. He described the graphics as &quot;beautiful&quot;, citing the varied sprites and flashing explosions. Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice of &quot;Gamasutra&quot; stated the audio-visuals and gameplay&#x27;s depth balanced the excessive difficulty. They praised the game&#x27;s &quot;catch and rescue&quot; feature, as well as the mini-map. Cuciz also praised the mini-map, stating that the game is impossible without it and that it allows players to plan strategies. Author John Sellers praised the audio-visuals and the connection between the game&#x27;s plot and gameplay.

GameDaily in 2009 rated &quot;Defender&quot; the ninth most difficult game, citing the attack and rescue gameplay. Author Steven L. Kent called it &quot;one of the toughest games in arcade history&quot;. He also stated that novice players typically are able to play only a few seconds, and that enthusiasts saw proficiency at the game as a &quot;badge of honor&quot;. David Cuciz echoed similar comments. Sellers described &quot;Defender&quot;&#x27;s difficulty as &quot;humbling&quot;, saying that few could play it with proficiency. He further stated that players would continue to play despite the difficulty. Author David Ellis attributes the game&#x27;s success to its challenging design. Its difficulty is often attributed to its complex control scheme. &quot;Edge&quot; magazine called &quot;Defender&quot; &quot;one of the most difficult-to-master&quot; games, describing its controls as &quot;daunting&quot;.

== Impact and legacy ==
Players have competed to obtain the highest score at the game and the longest play time on a single credit. Competitive playing for the longest play time was popularized by Mario Suarez from Atlantic City, who played &quot;Defender&quot; for over 21 and a half hours in 1982 at the Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. It was authenticated by the facility and the many witnesses that watched along with the press of Atlantic City; the media attention spurred other players to attempt the same feat. Expert players exploited software bugs to extend the length of their play time. &quot;Defender&quot; was the focus of the first Twin Galaxies video game contest. Players in 32 cities simultaneously competed on the weekend of April 3–4, 1982. Rick Smith was the victor with a score of 33,013,200 which took 38 hours. One bug, related to how the game keeps track of scoring, allows players to earn a large number of &quot;extra lives&quot;. Players can then use the extra lives to leave the game unattended while they rest. Other bugs allow the ship to avoid damage from the enemies, also prolonging the length of play.

&quot;Defender&quot; is considered the first side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up, predating &quot;Scramble&quot; by two months. Professor Jim Whitehead described &quot;Defender&quot; as a breakthrough title for its use of full 2D motion, multiple goals, and complex gameplay that provides players with several methods to play. James Hague of Dadgum Games called &quot;Defender&quot; a landmark title from the 1980s. Stearny said that the game&#x27;s use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen. Cuciz stated that &quot;Defender&quot;″s use of scrolling introduced the &quot;first true &#x27;gaming environment&#x27;&quot;. He further said that though the game&#x27;s mini-map feature had been introduced before, &quot;Defender&quot; integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Stearny described it as the most important space game in the early 1980s. He commented that its realism and technological advances pushed developers to create more popular games, citing &quot;Gorf&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; as examples. Vince listed the game as a classic title that introduced new technology, specifically scrolling. Ellis stated that prior to &quot;Defender&quot;, companies designed video games to have a balanced challenge. They believed games should be easy enough to attract players but difficult enough to limit play time to a few minutes; anything too challenging would dissuade players. Loguidice and Barton commented that &quot;Defender&quot;″s success, along with &quot;&quot;, illustrated that video game enthusiasts were ready for more difficult games, which spurred developers to create more complex game designs.

Jarvis&#x27;s contributions to the game&#x27;s development are often cited among his accolades. Author John Vince considered him one of the originators of &quot;high-action&quot; and &quot;reflex-based&quot; arcade games, citing &quot;Defender&quot;″s gameplay among other games designed by Jarvis. Ellis said that Jarvis established himself as an early &quot;hard-core&quot; designer with &quot;Defender&quot;. In 2007, IGN listed Eugene Jarvis as a top game designer whose titles (&quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Robotron: 2084&quot; and &quot;Smash TV&quot;) have influenced the video game industry. Barton and Loguidice stated that the game helped establish Williams and Jarvis as key figures in the arcade game industry. Sellers echoed similar comments. After the success of &quot;Defender&quot;, Williams expanded their business by building a new facility and hired more employees. Before the expansion, Jarvis could work in isolation. But the influx of people created an environment he was unhappy with. He left Williams along with DeMar to found their own development company, Vid Kidz. The company served as a consulting firm to Williams and developed two games for them.

=== Remakes and sequels ===
The success of &quot;Defender&quot; prompted Williams to approach Vid Kidz, who originally wanted to create a new game. DeMar, however, suggested creating an enhanced version of &quot;Defender&quot; to meet Williams&#x27; four-month deadline. Vid Kidz titled the game &quot;Stargate&quot; and developed it as a sequel to &quot;Defender&quot;. It features new elements and improved the original&#x27;s performance. Some home ports of &quot;Stargate&quot; were released under the title &quot;Defender II&quot;. Williams released a &quot;Defender&quot;-themed pinball machine in 1982. It has many elements from the original game: sound effects, enemies, waves, and weapons. Williams produced fewer than 400 units.

Midway&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Strike Force&quot; is an update and indirect sequel to &quot;Defender&quot;. Jarvis and DeMar assisted with the game. Atari Corporation released &quot;Defender 2000&quot; in 1995 for the Atari Jaguar. It was developed by Jeff Minter, who had previously updated &quot;Tempest&quot; as &quot;Tempest 2000&quot;. A 2002 remake, published simply as &quot;Defender&quot;, uses 3D graphics and a third-person viewpoint. It was released for the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2. The original game is included in the 1996 compilation &quot;Williams Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; and the 2003 compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;. In 1997, Tiger Electronics released a handheld edition of &quot;Defender&quot; with a grayscale LCD screen, which doubles as a keychain ornament.

Home games that copied &quot;Defender&quot;″s design include &quot;Gorgon&quot; (1981) and &quot;Repton&quot; (1983) for the Apple II; &quot;Alien Defense&quot; (1981) for the TRS 80 Model III; &quot;Chopper Command&quot; (1982) for the Atari 2600; &quot;Protector II&quot; (1983) and &quot;Dropzone&quot; (1984) for the Atari 8-bit computers; and, for the BBC Micro, &quot;Defender&quot; (1982) was renamed to &quot;Planetoid&quot; (1984) to avoid litigation. It influenced Jeff Minter&#x27;s &quot;Andes Attack&quot; for the VIC-20 home computer. &quot;StarRay&quot; (1988) was retitled &quot;Revenge of Defender&quot; in the US. Some games, such as &quot;The Tail of Beta Lyrae&quot; (1983) and &quot;R-Type&quot; (1987), were influenced more by &quot;Defender&quot; side-scrolling action than the gameplay itself. Later games influenced by &quot;Defender&quot; include &quot;Datastorm&quot; (1989) for the Amiga and &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; (1986) for arcades and a variety of home consoles.

<doc id="512078" wikidata="Q952823" url="?curid=512078" title="New River (Kanawha River tributary)">
<text>The New River is a river which flows through the U.S. states of North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia before joining with the Gauley River to form the Kanawha River at the town of Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. Part of the Ohio River watershed, it is about long.

The origins of the name are unclear. Possibilities include being a new river that was not on the Fry-Jefferson map of Virginia, an Indian name meaning &quot;new waters&quot;, or the surname of an early settler. It was once called Wood&#x27;s River for Colonel Abraham Wood, an English explorer from Virginia, who explored the river in the mid-17th century. Despite its name, the New River is one of the five oldest rivers in the world geologically. However, a claim that the river is the second oldest in the world is disputed by the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey and the National Park Service.

This low-level crossing of the Appalachians, many millions of years old, has long been a biogeographical corridor allowing numerous species of plants and animals to spread between the lowlands of the American East Coast and those of the Midwest. Unusual kinds of plants occur on the gorge&#x27;s cliffs or rim-top ledges. Portions of this corridor are now also used by various railroads and highways, and some segments of the river have been dammed for hydroelectric power production.

The New River Gorge is not only quite scenic, but also offers numerous opportunities for white-water recreation such as rafting and kayaking. Many open ledges along the rim of the gorge offer popular views, with favorites including Hawks Nest State Park and various overlooks on lands of the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.

The New River Gorge and the U.S. 19 bridge crossing it are shown on the West Virginia State Quarter, minted in 2005.

==Course==
This ancient river begins in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, and its North Fork and South Fork meet near the City of Boone, North Carolina. It flows generally northeastward through the New River Valley portion of the Great Appalachian Valley in western North Carolina and Virginia. It then crosses through the Ridge and Valley Province, cutting between Walker Mountain and Sinking Creek Mountain, and then between East River Mountain and Peters Mountain. It then turns and following a more northwestward course into West Virginia, where it then cuts through the Appalachian Plateau in the New River Gorge. It meets the Gauley River to become the Kanawha River in south-central West Virginia. The Kanawha then flows into the Ohio River at Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Much of the river&#x27;s course is lined with steep cliffs and rock outcrops, particularly in its gorge in West Virginia.
The New River is formed by the confluence of the South Fork New River and the North Fork New River on the Ashe County-Alleghany County line in North Carolina. It then flows through Alleghany County into southwestern Virginia, passing near Galax, Virginia. It is impounded by three small dams between Galax and Ivanhoe: at Fries, by Byllesby Dam, and by Buck Dam. Continuing north, the river enters Pulaski County, Virginia, where it is impounded by Claytor Dam, creating Claytor Lake. North of the dam the New River accepts the Little River, bends around three sides of the city of Radford, Virginia and bends again around the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, marking the boundary between Pulaski and Montgomery County, Virginia, before passing through Walker Mountain via a narrow water gap. After flowing north through Giles County, Virginia and the town of Narrows, the river crosses into West Virginia.

==Dams and bridges==

The New River is impounded by Bluestone Dam, creating Bluestone Lake in Summers County, West Virginia. The Bluestone River tributary joins the New River in Bluestone Lake. Just below the dam the Greenbrier River joins the New River, which continues its northward course into the New River Gorge. Near the end of the gorge the river flows by the town of Fayetteville, West Virginia. A few miles northwest of Fayetteville, much of the New River&#x27;s flow is diverted through the Hawks Nest Tunnel for use in power generation. The water re-enters the river just upstream of Gauley Bridge, where the New merges with the Gauley River to form the Kanawha River. The Kanawha is a tributary of the Ohio River, which in turn is a tributary of the Mississippi River.

Few highways cross the gorge, with the most dramatic bridge by far being the New River Gorge Bridge on U.S. 19, a steel arch bridge spanning , with the roadway above the average level of the river. This structure is the fifth-longest single-arch bridge in the world, and is also the world&#x27;s twenty-third-highest vehicular bridge, and the fourth highest in the Americas. At the time it was built, New River Gorge Bridge was the world&#x27;s highest bridge carrying a regular roadway, a title it held until the 2001 opening of the Liuguanghe Bridge in China.

==Geology==
Ironically, the New River is considered by some geologists to be one of the oldest rivers in the world, and certainly one of the oldest rivers in North America. The New River flows in a generally south-to-north course, at times cutting through the southwest-to-northeast-trending ridges and geological texture of the Appalachian Mountains, and flows directly through the Appalachian Plateau, contrasting with the west-to-east flow of most other major rivers to the east and northeast in Virginia and North Carolina, and on the west side of the Appalachians on the Plateau.

It may have been in its present course for at least 65 million years. In the geologic past, the New River was a much longer stream. Geologists have named it the Teays. The last advance of Pleistocene continental glacial ice buried most of this river. At that time, the waters of the New were diverted into rivers (the present-day Ohio &amp; Kanawha Rivers) created by the glaciers.

==Natural history==

On its journey through the New River Gorge, the New River passes through an extensive geological formation. Emergent rocks and rock outcrops are found to provide diverse habitat producing rich and abundant flora and fauna species. In the gorge, there is typically a 1000 feet difference in elevation between the river bottom and the adjacent plateau. The New River dissects all physiographic provinces of the Appalachian Mountains, and therefore is believed to be a corridor facilitating the movement of southern plant and animal species into West Virginia. In addition to serving as a refuge for some species, New River Gorge provides a geographical barrier that limits the east-west distribution of other species.

Because the New River is so old, its habitats and wildlife have been able to achieve a form of stability. Millions of years of available passage have allowed many species of plants and animals to move in and persist in the area. Since the New River cuts from east to west through the Appalachians, we find species that are typically Atlantic coastal plain and piedmont, such as melic grass, living with northern mountain species. Because time has favored the New River Gorge, certain unique species have been able to carve their own niches here. Several species of fish have evolved that are endemic (found nowhere else) to this river.

===Plants===

New River Gorge lies at the core of the largest remaining block of relatively unfragmented, mid-latitude forest in the world. The gorge section of New River supports the most diverse plant assemblage of any river gorge in the central and southern Appalachians. This is due, in part, to the moisture gradient extremes that exist between the rim and river. This portion of southern West Virginia falls within the Mixed Mesophytic Forest Region. Recognized forest types include oak-hickory, mixed oak, oak-maple, oak-yellow pine, hemlock-hardwoods, northern hardwoods, cove hardwoods, and bottomland and floodplain hardwoods.

Also located in the gorge is the rare Appalachian Flatrock plant community which includes sedges, cedars and pines. This plant assemblage occurs on flat sandstone ledges along the New River and is dependent on the scouring caused by occasional flooding for its long-term integrity.

===Animals===

A wide variety of animals live in and around the New River, the Gorge, and the surrounding forests. The New River has long served as a migration corridor for both plants and animals. For this reason, animals more commonly found much farther south may reach the northern extent of their range in the New River Gorge area. Likewise, animals more commonly associated with the northern forests may reach the southern extent of their range in this area. Other animals are found only in the New River area. These species, called endemics, were isolated from similar populations by the steep, rugged terrain of New River Gorge and/or the tumultuous rapids and waterfalls of New River. Thus isolated, these animals evolved to be adapted to the unique circumstances of New River Gorge.

Approximately 65 species of mammals are known to occur in the New River Gorge area, such as beaver, mink, muskrat, river otter. Continuous forest, abandoned mine portals, rivers and streams provide habitat for a diverse variety of amphibians like hellbenders (large aquatic salamanders). There are nearly 40 species of reptiles like the eastern fence lizard, five-lined skinks, copperhead snake, black rat snake, river cooter, stinkpot turtles (common musk turtle) and snapping turtles. And many benthic macroinvertebrates including worms, crustaceans and immature forms of aquatic insects, such as dragon fly, stonefly and mayfly nymphs.

The New River and the gorge area provides critical habitat for birds such as bald eagles, osprey, great blue herons, kingfishers, numerous ducks and migrating waterfowl like loons, cormorants, hooded mergansers and other migratory birds including the Cerulean warbler, a species in decline elsewhere in its range.

====Fish====

The New River basin has eight endemic species of fish, which are the Appalachia darter, bigmouth chub, bluestone sculpin, candy darter, Kanawha sculpin, Kanawha darter, Kanawha minnow, and New River shiner.

==History==

The fur trading Batts and Fallam expedition of 1671, sent by Colonel Abraham Wood, was the first recorded exploration of the river. Variant names of the New River include &quot;Wood River&quot; and &quot;Wood&#x27;s River&quot;, after Abraham Wood. Mary Draper Ingles traversed the gorge during her 1755 escape from captivity among the Shawnees. Hiking or driving through New River Gorge today will provide glimpses of old stone walls, foundations of homes and buildings, coal mine entrances, and coke ovens decaying alongside the railroad tracks.

The New River and its Gorge and Valley have been turned into protected parks and recreation areas along much of the river. Congress has designated the New River Gorge the &quot;New River Gorge National River&quot;. The choice of national river designation came about through a long series of discussions among interested parties. A grassroots coalition formed and pleaded the case for protection of the area in Congress. The initial goal, however, was not protective designation of the gorge in West Virginia, but stopping an engineering project on the Virginia-North Carolina border. Plans had been proposed in the early 1960s to dam the New River in Virginia, backing up water into North Carolina for pumped storage, the production of hydroelectric power, and the regular flushing of pollution downstream. Proponents called it the Blue Ridge Pumped Storage Project. Many citizens in West Virginia felt that such a dam would negatively affect the gorge. Water flow and quality were major concerns. These West Virginia opponents to the dam joined those in Virginia and North Carolina and helped block the dam before shifting attention toward protection of the New River in West Virginia. The coalition ultimately chose a designation for the New River Gorge that would have a chance of success in Congress. That designation passed Congress in 1978.

==Recreation==
The New River exhibits class II to IV rapids in the summer, making it a popular whitewater rafting and kayaking destination. The spring runoff brings class IV and V rapids. Several commercial outfitters offer guided river trips. New River Gorge National Park and Preserve contains numerous trails for hiking and mountain biking, as well as over 1400 established rock climbs.

The New River is spanned near Fayetteville, West Virginia, by the New River Gorge Bridge (US 19). &quot;Bridge Walk&quot; tours are offered on the wide steel catwalk running under the bridge deck. The bridge is also open for BASE jumping once annually on Bridge Day.

===Fishing===
Multiple West Virginia stage record fish were caught along the New River.

==Environmental factors==

Much of the river&#x27;s course through West Virginia is designated as the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, and the New River is one of the nation&#x27;s American Heritage Rivers. In 1975, North Carolina designated a segment of the river as &quot;New River State Scenic River&quot;, by including it in the state&#x27;s Natural and Scenic Rivers System. The segment was added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System the following year.

The quality of the surface water resources of the New River has been studied in recent years by both the State of West Virginia and New River Gorge Park Resource Management staff. Data from these studies suggest the presence of metals, organic contaminants and influx of raw sewage are common in many tributaries of the New River. Metals contamination, resulting from mining activities and or urban surface flows, are present in most tributaries. Other sources of pollutants within park boundaries include unlined landfills, illegal dumps, pesticide sprayed directly into the New River, agricultural runoff, road salt runoff, direct discharge of residential sewage, inadequate municipal sewage treatment facilities, recreation waste streams, and industrial discharges. Pollution of rural streams by fecal coliform bacteria is a widespread issue. Since fecal coliform bacteria live in the gut of warm-blooded animals, fecal contamination of rural streams can come not only from humans, but also from livestock, pets, and wildlife (including birds). Several research efforts have been made to understand the role of these various potential sources of bacteria. One of these studies was conducted in New River Gorge by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the National Park Service. The results indicate that human-caused wastewater pollution is present in each of the four New River Gorge tributaries sampled. The report also found other sources of contamination in some streams.

Most of the original deciduous forest stands and understory species have been impacted by past and current activities associated with timbering, mining, agriculture, transportation, utilities, and the exclusion of fire. Internal development projects, increasing recreational activities, and expanding commercial and residential influences on the boundary continue to put pressure on a highly fragmented base resource. Power lines and rights-of-way present additional problems. There is currently only limited information on all such areas throughout the park. Right-of-ways are routinely maintained with herbicides application or mechanically treated. There are currently no Special Use Permits in place to regulate this activity. Herbicides are managed through the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program. The park lies directly in the path of the leading edge of spongy moth infestation. Baseline data on the condition of resources, which would be the indicators of the effects of defoliation, does not exist. Critical documents, such as the Environmental Assessment for spongy moth management, require detailed information and hard scientific data in order to justify management actions.

Many areas within New River Gorge have been impacted by either strip or deep mining for coal, as well as by oil and gas operations. The park has completed an Abandoned Mine Lands Inventory (AML Inventory) that identifies 115 sites that are abandoned. Many of these sites were abandoned prior to the 1977 Surface Mining Reclamation Act (SMCRA), and are completely or partially unreclaimed. Since 1987, the National Park Service and the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) have worked together to mitigate the most severe safety hazards identified on this inventory.

Air pollution sources resulting from activities within the park includes windblown soil and dust from construction activities, smoke from residential wood burning, automobile emissions, and forest fires. A significant issue for the park is solid waste management. Hundreds of illegal dumps and roadside trash create both aesthetic and health and safety problems. Hazardous waste is also an issue. 
The area has active rail lines and abandoned mine operations. There is great potential for hazardous material spills to occur within the gorge. Also, some potential development sites within the New River Gorge have been surveyed during preliminary development concept planning. Asbestos has been found in several historic structures within the park, and this has lengthened the time and costs involved in renovation of these buildings.

Over time, the New River Gorge has provided a refuge for plants and animals as habitats have shifted with changing weather patterns. As global climate change progresses, the New River Gorge will provide critical habitat for species displaced from warmer climates.

<text>What Do You Know, Deutschland? is the debut studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released in December 1986 by Z and Skysaw Records.

==Background==
&quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot; was recorded from 1983 to 1986, with some tracks recorded before En Esch had started working with KMFDM founders Sascha Konietzko and Raymond Watts, some even before the band officially formed in 1984.

==Release==
Originally released by Z Records in Germany in 1986 with different artwork, the album was re-released, including songs from the &quot;Kickin&#x27; Ass&quot; single, in 1987 by SkySaw Records in the United Kingdom. In 1991, Wax Trax! Records released &quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot; in the United States without &quot;Zip&quot;. &quot;Zip&quot; was later released on the compilation album Agogo.

A remastered reissue of &quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot; was released September 12, 2006, featuring new liner notes and photos of the band.

A new version of the track &quot;Kickin&#x27; Ass&quot; was released under Watts&#x27; musical project PIG in November 2020, featuring guitarwork by Esch.

==Reception==

Vincent Jeffries of Allmusic said many of the songs lack the &quot;guitar fury&quot; of later releases, but that the album as a whole &quot;has enough industrial grit to keep KMFDM fans interested in, if not awed by its dark intentions&quot;.

==Track listings==
===Z Records release (1986)===
&quot;Me I Funk&quot; is a partial cover of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Ballrooms of Mars&quot; from The Slider.

===SkySaw Records release (1987)===
This version was released by Wax Trax! in 1991 (without the track &quot;Zip&quot;), and remastered by Metropolis in 2006 (with &quot;Zip&quot; reinstated).

<doc id="512093" wikidata="Q3047157" url="?curid=512093" title="Sedimentation equilibrium">
<text>Sedimentation equilibrium in a suspension of different particles, such as molecules, exists when the rate of transport of each material in any one direction due to sedimentation equals the rate of transport in the opposite direction due to diffusion. Sedimentation is due to an external force, such as gravity or centrifugal force in a centrifuge.

It was discovered for colloids by Jean Baptiste Perrin for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926.

== Colloid ==
In a colloid, the colloidal particles are said to be in sedimentation equilibrium if the rate of sedimentation is equal to the rate of movement from Brownian motion. For dilute colloids, this is described using the Laplace-Perrin distribution law:

formula_1

where

formula_2 is the colloidal particle volume fraction as a function of vertical distance formula_3 above reference point formula_4,

formula_5 is the colloidal particle volume fraction at reference point formula_4,

formula_7 is the buoyant mass of the colloidal particles,

formula_8 is the standard acceleration due to gravity,

formula_9 is the Boltzmann constant,

formula_10 is the absolute temperature,

and formula_11 is the sedimentation length.

The buoyant mass is calculated using formula_12

where formula_13 is the difference in mass density between the colloidal particles and the suspension medium, and formula_14 is the colloidal particle volume found using the volume of a sphere (formula_15 is the radius of the colloidal particle).

=== Sedimentation length ===
The Laplace-Perrin distribution law can be rearranged to give the sedimentation length formula_11. The sedimentation length describes the probability of finding a colloidal particle at a height formula_3 above the point of reference formula_4. At the length formula_11 above the reference point, the concentration of colloidal particles decreases by a factor of formula_20.

formula_21

If the sedimentation length is much greater than the diameter formula_22 of the colloidal particles (formula_23), the particles can diffuse a distance greater than this diameter, and the substance remains a suspension. However, if the sedimentation length is less than the diameter (formula_24), the particles can only diffuse by a much shorter length. They will sediment under the influence of gravity and settle to the bottom of the container. The substance can no longer be considered a colloidal suspension. It may become a colloidal suspension again if an action to undertaken to suspend the colloidal particles again, such as stirring the colloid.

==== Example ====
The difference in mass density formula_13 between the colloidal particles of mass density formula_26 and the medium of suspension of mass density formula_27, and the diameter of the particles, have an influence on the value of formula_11. As an example, consider a colloidal suspension of polyethylene particles in water, and three different values for the diameter of the particles: 0.1 μm, 1 μm and 10 μm. The volume of a colloidal particles can be calculated using the volume of a sphere formula_29.

formula_26 is the mass density of polyethylene, which is approximately on average 920 kg/m3 and formula_27 is the mass density of water, which is approximately 1000 kg/m3 at room temperature (293K). Therefore formula_32 is -80 kg/m3.

Generally, formula_11 decreases with formula_34. For the 0.1 μm diameter particle, formula_11 is larger than the diameter, and the particles will be able to diffuse. For the 10 μm diameter particle, formula_11 is much smaller than the diameter. As formula_11 is negative the particles will cream, and the substance will no longer be a colloidal suspension.

In this example, the difference is mass density formula_13 is relatively small. Consider a colloid with particles much denser than polyethylene, for example silicon with a mass density of approximately 2330 kg/m3. If these particles are suspended in water, formula_13 will be 1330 kg/m3. formula_11 will decrease as formula_13 increases. For example, if the particles had a diameter of 10 μm the sedimentation length would be 5.92×10−4 μm, one order of magnitude smaller than for polyethylene particles. Also, because the particles are more dense than water, formula_11 is positive and the particles will sediment.

==Ultracentrifuge==
Modern applications use the analytical ultracentrifuge. The theoretical basis for the measurements is developed from the Mason-Weaver equation. The advantage of using analytical sedimentation equilibrium analysis for Molecular Weight of proteins and their interacting mixtures is the avoidance of need for derivation of a frictional coefficient, otherwise required for interpretation of dynamic sedimentation.

Sedimentation equilibrium can be used to determine molecular mass. It forms the basis for an analytical ultracentrifugation method for measuring molecular masses, such as those of proteins, in solution.

<doc id="512111" wikidata="Q185532" url="?curid=512111" title="Seram Island">
<text>Seram (formerly spelled Ceram; also Seran or Serang) is the largest and main island of Maluku province of Indonesia, despite Ambon Island&#x27;s historical importance. It is located just north of the smaller Ambon Island and a few other adjacent islands, such as Saparua, Haruku, Nusa Laut and the Banda Islands.

== Geography and geology ==
Seram is traversed by a central mountain range, the highest point of which, Mount Binaiya, is covered with dense rain forests. Its remarkably complex geology is because of its location at the meeting of several tectonic microplates, which have been described as &quot;one of the most tectonically complex areas on Earth&quot;. Seram falls on its microplate, which has been twisted around by 80° in the last 8 million years by the relatively faster movement of the Papua microplate. Meanwhile, along with the northward push of the Australian Plate, this has resulted in the uplift that gives north-central Seram peaks of over 3000 m. On the island, there are important karst areas. In the mountains, near Sawai, there is the cave Hatu Saka, currently the deepest cave in Indonesia (-388 m). In Taniwel district, on the north coast, is the underground river Sapalewa, one of the largest underground rivers on the planet.

The population of the island and the neighbouring smaller islands in the 2020 Census was 773,459 people, administered among three regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;), namely Maluku Tengah Regency (which had 204,907 people on Seram Island itself and 218,185 on the lesser islands, the majority on Ambon Island), Seram Bagian Barat Regency and Seram Bagian Timur Regency.

== Ecology==

Seram Island is remarkable for its high degree of localised bird endemism. There are 117 species of birds on the island; 14 species and subspecies are endemic, including the eclectus, great-billed and Moluccan king parrot, purple-naped and red lories, salmon-crested cockatoo, Seram masked owl, collared, sacred and lazuli kingfishers, long-crested myna, elegant imperial-pigeon, Seram oriole, metallic starlings and grey-necked and Seram friarbirds.

The mammals found on Seram include Asian murid rodents as well as Australasian marsupials, including the common spotted cuscus and several species of &quot;Phalanger&quot;. The mountain area of Seram supports the greatest number of endemic mammals of any island in the region. It harbors 38 mammal species and includes nine species that are endemic or near-endemic, several of which are limited to montane habitats. These include the Seram bandicoot, several bat species including Moluccan and Seram flying foxes, Manusela mosaic-tailed rat, spiny Ceram rat and the Ceram rat, all considered threatened.

Herpetiles are highly prevalent on the islands. The largest and most dangerous to humans is the saltwater crocodile, found within the island&#x27;s coastal brackish waters and deltas; some are known to swim inland via freshwater routes, such as the Salawai River. Other reptiles of the island include Amboina sailfin lizards, &quot;Bronchocela&quot; sp., the brown tree snake, emerald tree skinks, green sea turtles, Indonesian blue-tongued skinks, Moluccan flying snakes and the tokay gecko, among numerous other species of gecko and skink. Amphibians include &quot;Fejervarya&quot;, fork-tongued frogs and Horst&#x27;s and white-lipped tree frogs.

In the eastern part of the island, Manusela National Park was established in 1997, covering an area of 1,890 km2 (11% of the island).

== History ==

Most central Moluccans consider Seram to be their original ancestral home and it is still known colloquially as Nusa Ina (Mother Island).
In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Seram was generally within the sphere of influence of Ternate, although it was often ruled more directly by the Ternaten vassal state of Buru. The expedition of António de Abreu (as captain) and Francisco Serrão sighted and explored the entire southern coast of Seram in early 1512, for the first time for Europeans. Portuguese missionaries were active there in the 16th century. Dutch trading posts were opened in the early 17th century, and the island came under nominal Dutch control c. 1650. The Tidore Sultanate made periodical claims on Seram and were accorded suzerainty in the eastern part of the island from 1700 to 1768. In the 1780s, Seram provided a key base of support for Prince Nuku of Tidore&#x27;s long-running rebellion against Dutch rule. From 1954 until 1962 the island&#x27;s mountain terrain was the scene of an armed guerilla struggle against Indonesian rule by the counter revolutionary Republic of South Maluku movement led by Chris Soumokil.
== Administration ==
Seram includes three of the regencies within the province of Maluku, but administratively each of these regencies includes a number of smaller islands adjacent to Seram.
# West Seram Regency (&quot;Kabupaten Seram Bagian Barat&quot;) is mainly located on the island of Seram, but includes various islands lying to the west of Seram – Manipa, Kelang, Boano and the smaller Babi, Pua and Marsegu. It covers a land area of 6,948.40 km2, and had a population of 164,654 at the 2010 Census and 212,393 at the 2020 Census; the estimated total in mid 2023 was 214,979. The principal town lies at Piru.
# Central Maluku Regency (&quot;Kabupaten Maluku Tengah&quot;), with its capital at Masohi, includes the middle part of Seram, as well as much of Ambon Island (apart from the City of Ambon which forms the southern half of that island), the Lease Islands (Saparua, Haruku, Nusa Laut) and some other smaller offshore islands, plus the Banda Islands further to the south. It covers 11,595.57 km2 and had a population of 423,094 at the 2020 Census; this excludes the City of Ambon, which occupies the southern half of Ambon Island but is administratively not part of the regency. The portion of the regency on Seram Island itself covers 10,680.55 km2, and had an estimated 213,694 inhabitants in mid 2023.
# East Seram Regency (&quot;Kabupaten Seram Bagian Timur&quot;) is mainly located on the island of Seram, but also includes smaller islands to the southeast comprising the Gorom and Watubela archipelagoes. The regency covers a land area of 5,779.12 km2, and had a population of 99,065 at the 2010 Census and 137,972 at the 2020 Census. The principal town lies at Bula. Excluding the Gorom and Watubela archipelagoes, the &#x27;mainland&#x27; of East Seram covered 5,577 km2 and had a population of 92,500 in mid 2023.

== Religion ==
Seram has been traditionally associated with the animism of the indigenous Alfur (or Nuaulu), a West Melanesian people who reputedly retained a custom of headhunting until the 1940s. Today, however, most of the population of Seram is either Muslim or Christian due to both conversion and immigration. Seram was affected by the violent inter-religious conflict that swept Maluku province starting in late 1998, resulting in tens of thousands of displaced persons across the province but after the Malino II Accord of 2002 tempers cooled. Seram has been peaceful for many years but towns like Masohi remain informally divided into de facto Christian and Muslim sections.
Around 7,000 people belonging to the Manusela tribe follow Hinduism.

== Economy ==
Copra, resin, sago, and fish are important products. Oil is produced in the northeast near Bula by CITIC Seram Energy who took over from KUFPEC (Indonesia) Limited in 2006. The Oseil oil field is located onshore in the northeast of the island in the Seram Non-Bula Production Sharing Contract area. The discovery well was drilled in 1993. As of end 2010 the Seram Non-Bula Block had estimated proven oil reserves of 9.7 million barrels. Most production comes from the Jurassic Manusela carbonate formation.

<doc id="512121" wikidata="Q1630792" url="?curid=512121" title="Follow focus">
<text>A follow focus is a focus control mechanism used in filmmaking with film cameras and in television production with professional video cameras. It helps the camera operator be more efficient and precise. It is usually operated by a focus puller (often called the 1st assistant camera, or 1st AC), but some camera operators prefer to pull their own focus (the act of changing focus is called &quot;pulling&quot; or racking focus).

==Overview==
Manual focusing is usually a requisite for professional filmmaking, because autofocus systems may focus on undesired objects, or fail to adjust quickly enough to sudden changes. The job of the focus puller then is to adjust the focus onto different subjects as well as maintain focus during movement of the camera relative to the subject.

The mechanism works through a set of gears on the follow focus that are attached to teeth on the focus ring of the lens. These gears feed to a wheel that, when turned by a focus puller, spins the teeth and thus the ring on the lens. Practically, the device is not necessary as the operator can directly turn the ring on the lens. However, this would place the hand in an awkward position perpendicular to the camera rather than parallel, and turning beyond a certain distance (such as 360 degrees) would be impossible. Sometimes, such a &quot;focus pull&quot; would even be difficult with a follow focus, so an L-shaped metal rod called a speed crank can be attached in the provided square hole at the center of the wheel. Thus, the hand merely has to spin the rod, which turns the wheel. If it is necessary for the operator to stand a short distance from the camera, e.g., if the camera is inconveniently high, a short flexible cable called a &quot;focus whip&quot; can be used.

The stationary white disk surrounding the wheel is used by the focus puller to jot down marks, and take care of the focus according to the marks he/she took during rehearsals. A focus puller often uses a tape to correctly measure the distance from the lens to the subject, allowing for accurate marking of the disk.

Some autofocus lenses with a focus ring (such as those on most consumer and camcorders) are not &quot;true&quot; manual focus lenses—meaning that turning the ring does not directly adjust the elements inside the lens, but rather actuates the internal camera electronics that adjust the focus point. Such lenses are sometimes called &quot;focus by wire,&quot; and the behavior then depends upon the software algorithm used by the lens. If the focusing algorithm only considers the &quot;distance&quot; the focusing ring is turned (called &quot;linear&quot; focus-by-wire), then the behavior of the lens is very similar to that of a manual-focus lens. However, certain implementations of such a system also consider the &quot;speed&quot; with which the ring was turned (called &quot;nonlinear&quot; focus-by-wire), which can make precise and repeatable focus pulls difficult, and use of a follow focus impractical.

<doc id="512123" wikidata="Q2302456" url="?curid=512123" title="TWA Flight 847">
<text>TWA Flight 847 was a regularly scheduled Trans World Airlines flight from Cairo to San Diego with en route stops in Athens, Rome, Boston, and Los Angeles. On the morning of June 14, 1985, Flight 847 was hijacked soon after take off from Athens. The Hezbollah hijackers demanded the release of 700 Shia Muslims from Israeli custody and took the plane repeatedly to Beirut and Algiers. Later Western analysis confirmed them members of Hezbollah, an allegation Hezbollah rejects.

The passengers and crew endured a three-day intercontinental ordeal. Some passengers were threatened and some beaten. Passengers with Jewish-sounding names were separated from the others. United States Navy diver Robert Stethem was murdered, and his body was thrown onto the airport apron. Dozens of passengers were kept hostage during the next two weeks until released by their captors after some of their demands were met.

== Hijacking events ==
Flight 847 was operated with a Boeing 727–200, registration The flight originated in Cairo on the morning of June 14. After an uneventful flight from Cairo to Athens, a new crew boarded Flight 847. The new crew in Athens were Captain John Testrake, First Officer Phil Maresca, Flight Engineer Christian Zimmerman, flight service manager Uli Derickson, and flight attendants Judy Cox, Hazel Hesp, Elizabeth Howes, and Helen Sheahan.

At 10:10, Flight 847 departed Athens for Rome. It was hijacked soon after takeoff by two Arabic-speaking Lebanese men who had smuggled a pistol and two grenades through the Athens airport security. One was identified later as Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who was eventually captured and sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany. Hamadi is an alleged member of Hezbollah. 

The hijackers assaulted Derickson, breaching the cockpit and dragging her with them before attacking and pistol-whipping Testrake, Maresca, and Zimmerman.

=== To Beirut, then Algiers ===

With Captain Testrake being held at gunpoint, the airplane was diverted from its original destination of Rome, in airspace over Greece, to the Middle East and made its first stop, for several hours, at the Beirut International Airport in Lebanon, where 19 passengers were allowed to leave in exchange for fuel. Shortly before landing, air traffic control initially refused to let them land in Beirut. Captain Testrake argued with air traffic control until they relented. When Beirut ATC tried to talk to the hijackers, Testrake interrupted, &quot;He has pulled a hand-grenade pin and he is ready to blow up the aircraft if he has to. We must, I repeat, we must land at Beirut. We must land at Beirut. No alternative.&quot;

At the time, Lebanon was in the midst of the Lebanese Civil War, and Beirut was divided into sectors controlled by different Shia Amal militia and Hezbollah. That afternoon, the aircraft continued on across the Mediterranean Sea to Algiers, where 20 passengers were released during a five-hour stop before heading back to Beirut that night.

=== Back to Beirut ===

Beirut International Airport was surrounded by a Shia neighborhood. It had no perimeter security and had been overrun by Islamist militias, and nearby residents could simply drive onto the runway.

The hijackers had systematically and regularly beaten all the military passengers, but during this stop, they selected U.S. Navy diver, Robert Stethem, beat him, shot him in the right temple, and dumped his body out of the plane onto the ramp and shot him again, seeking permission from other Shia Muslims operating the control tower to obtain more fuel. Seven American passengers, alleged to have Jewish-sounding surnames, were taken off the jet and kept captive in a Shia prison in Beirut.

=== Algiers, Beirut again ===
Nearly a dozen heavily armed men joined the hijackers before the airplane returned to Algiers the next day, 15 June, where an additional 65 passengers and all five female cabin crew members were released.

The initial demands of the hijackers included:
* Release of the &quot;Kuwait 17&quot;, those involved in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy in Kuwait 
* Release of all 766 mainly Lebanese Shias transferred to Israel&#x27;s Atleat Prison in conjunction with immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon
* International condemnation of Israel and the United States.

The Greek government released the accomplice, Ali Atwa, and in exchange the hijackers released eight Greek citizens, including Greek popular singer Demis Roussos, to be flown by a Greek government business jet from Algiers back to Athens.

By the afternoon of June 17, the 40 hostages remaining had been taken from the airplane and kept captive throughout Beirut by Hezbollah. Nabih Berri was the chief of the Amal militia and the minister of justice in the fractured Lebanon cabinet. One of the hostages was released on 26 June when he developed heart trouble. The other 39 remained captive until June 30 when they were collected in a local schoolyard after an intervention by U.S. President Ronald Reagan along with Lebanese officials. The released hostages then met with international journalists and were driven to Syria by the International Red Cross to the Sheraton Hotel and a press conference in Damascus.

The hostages then boarded a U.S. Air Force C-141B Starlifter cargo plane and flew to Rhein-Main AB, Hesse, West Germany, where they were met by U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush, debriefed, given medical examinations, then flown to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland and welcomed home by the president. Over the next several weeks, Israel released over 700 Shia prisoners, while maintaining that the prisoners&#x27; release was not related to the hijacking.

== Afterward ==
A famous image of this hijacking was a photograph showing a gun being held near Captain Testrake, sticking out of the cockpit window, while he and the other pilots were being interviewed by ABC News reporter Charles Glass. The scene was interrupted by one of the French-speaking Hezbollah guards left by the hijackers to hold the crew after most passengers and the cabin crew had been released in Algiers, and the remaining men were held in captivity elsewhere in Beirut. The young militiaman may have unloaded the gun before entering the scene, as he primarily wanted to be on television.

Flight attendant Uli Derickson was credited with calming one of the hijackers during a fuel-quantity incident during the first leg to Beirut, because she spoke German, the only European language which either hijacker spoke. Notably, she interrupted an attempt to end the hijacking in Algiers when airport officials refused to refuel the plane without payment by offering her own Shell Oil credit card, which was used to charge about $5,500 for 22,700 L (6,000 gal) of jet fuel, for which she was reimbursed. She also refused to cooperate with the hijackers in identifying for them the passports of any passengers with Jewish-sounding names so they could not be singled out.

, an commissioned in 1995, was named in memory of Robert Stethem. The aircraft involved in the hijacking was put back into service. It remained in service for TWA until the aircraft was retired on September 30, 2000. It ceremoniously operated the airline&#x27;s final revenue flight of their Boeing 727 fleet.

=== Alleged perpetrators ===
Hezbollah specialist Magnus Ranstorp of the University of St Andrews credits &quot;leading&quot; Hezbollah members Hassan Izz-Al-Din (later involved with the Kuwait Airways Flight 422 hijacking in 1988) and Mohammed Ali Hammadi, whose brother was one of the commanders of the Hezbollah Special Security Apparatus, with assisting Hezbollah operatives in the &quot;supervision and planning of the incident itself and as an active participant in the defusion and resolution&quot;.

On October 10, 2001, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, three of the alleged hijackers, Imad Mughniyeh, Ali Atwa, and Hassan Izz-Al-Din, having been indicted earlier in United States district courts for the 1985 skyjacking of the American airliner, were among the original 22 fugitives announced by President George W. Bush to be placed on the newly formed FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. Rewards of $5 million for information resulting in the arrest and conviction of Atwa and Izz-Al-Din are still being offered by the United States.

Mohammed Ali Hammadi was arrested in 1987 in Frankfurt, West Germany, while attempting to smuggle liquid explosives, two years after the TWA Flight 847 attack. In addition to the West German charge of illegal importation of explosives, he was tried and convicted of Stethem&#x27;s 1985 murder and was sentenced to life in prison. However, he was paroled and released by German officials on December 20, 2005, and returned to Lebanon. There has been speculation that his parole was granted as part of a covert prisoner swap, in exchange for the release of Susanne Osthoff. Taken hostage in Iraq a month prior, Osthoff was released the week of Hammadi&#x27;s parole. On February 14, 2006 the United States formally asked the Lebanese government to extradite Mohammed Ali Hammadi for Stethem&#x27;s murder. On February 24, 2006, he appeared as well on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list, with the name Mohammed Ali &quot;Hamadei&quot; (sic). He was among the second group of indicted fugitives to be named by the FBI to the list.

Several news outlets reported the announcement by Hezbollah of the death of Imad Mughniyeh in a car bomb explosion in Syria on February 13, 2008. The remaining three fugitives from TWA Flight 847 remain on the list, and at large.

On September 19, 2019, Greek police arrested a 65-year-old Lebanese man who was accused of involvement in the hijacking. The man was arrested at Mykonos during a passport check for cruise ship passengers. He was aboard a cruise ship that had crossed Rhodes, Santorini and Mykonos. Mykonos was the last stop before returning to Turkey. He was later released after police determined it was a case of mistaken identity.

Hezbollah reportedly denies culpability in the TWA Flight 847 hijacking, among its denials of numerous other attacks that have been attributed to the group.

<doc id="512125" wikidata="Q1189140" url="?curid=512125" title="Jeremy London">
<text>Jeremy Michael London (born November 7, 1972) is an American actor. He is best known for his regular roles on &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;, a starring role in the 1995 comedy film &quot;Mallrats&quot;, as well as a notable supporting role in the Civil War epic &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. London made his directorial debut with the 2013 horror film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dozen&quot;, in which he also appeared.

==Early life==
London was born in San Diego, California, the son of Debbie (née Osborn), a waitress, and Frank London, a sheet metal worker. He was raised mainly in DeSoto, Texas. After having divorced Jeremy&#x27;s father, his mother moved the family 13 times in six years. His identical twin brother, Jason, is older by 27 minutes and is also an actor. Jeremy has worked mostly in television while Jason has opted for a career in feature films. The two have acted alongside each other only once – in the February 3, 2003, episode of the WB&#x27;s &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, entitled &quot;Smoking.&quot; They have also competed for the same role – Jeremy&#x27;s first audition was for a part in the 1991 film &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;, which Jason won, leaving Jeremy the part of his brother&#x27;s stunt double.

The twin boys had a younger sister, Dedra, who was also an actor. Dedra London died in a car accident in 1992 at the age of 16.

==Career==
London&#x27;s first and second major television roles were playing Nathan on the critically acclaimed 1991–1993 drama series &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;. His brother Jason stepped in for Jeremy for the final episode of the show.

In 1995 he played T.S. Quint in Kevin Smith&#x27;s second film, &quot;Mallrats&quot;.

In 1995, he joined the cast of the Fox series &quot;Party of Five&quot;, playing Griffin Holbrook for three seasons, after serving as a recurring guest star. He then went on to play a young minister named Chandler Hampton on &quot;7th Heaven&quot; from 2002 to 2004. His &quot;7th Heaven&quot; character had a father with lung cancer, much like Jeremy&#x27;s real-life family members. He has since acted in many television serials, television films and feature films.

London was a cast member during the fourth season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, which premiered on VH1 in December 2010.

==Personal life==
London and his wife Melissa Cunningham were married in September 2006. They divorced five years later. They have a son named Lyrik. London married Juliet Reeves on June 3, 2014, and they have one son named Wyatt who was born in June 2014.

In June 2010, Jeremy alleged that he was involved in a bizarre kidnapping, approached by a group of men in Palm Springs, Calif., and forced to drive around for 12 hours purchasing alcohol and using drugs. Though he swore the incident was real, his mother and brother made public statements doubting the events. Jeremy filed a restraining order against them, only to have it denied by a judge.

London was a cast member during the fourth season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, which aired on VH1 from December 2010 to January 2011, and depicted his treatment for addiction at the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California. The third episode of that season depicted discussions involving him, Dr. Drew Pinsky and London&#x27;s wife, Melissa Cunningham, who was simultaneously being treated for addiction herself at a separate wing of the Center. His father, Frank, also appeared in Episode 7, which was filmed during Family Day, in which the patients discussed the effect of addiction on their family relationships.

London was charged with spousal battery in 2012 after an incident with his then wife, and in 2018 he was arrested for alleged domestic violence.

<text>Canadian Forces Base Kingston (also CFB Kingston) is a Canadian Forces base in Kingston, Ontario.

==History==

The Barriefield Military Camp, commonly called Camp Barriefield, was established as a military base at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 on the east bank of the Cataraqui River opposite the city of Kingston in the village of Barriefield. Located north of King&#x27;s Highway 2, the name of the military base and village was in honour of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Barrie who served during the War of 1812.

In 1937 the base expanded to the south side of King&#x27;s Highway 2 with the opening of the Vimy Barracks, named in honour of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The Vimy Barracks became home to the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals which relocated to the Barriefield Military Camp from the Borden Military Camp. The Signal Training Centre, later renamed the Royal Canadian School of Signals was also established at the base.

The Barriefield Military Camp continued to expand as one of Canada&#x27;s largest training bases when the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps established a training centre during the Second World War. Following the war, the original part of Barriefield Military Camp on the north side of the King&#x27;s Highway 2 was renamed the McNaughton Barracks in honour of the Canadian Army&#x27;s General A.G.L. McNaughton who served during the First and Second World Wars. From 1945 to 1969 the McNaughton Barracks were host to the Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers School.

The base was renamed to Canadian Forces Base Kingston (CFB Kingston) in 1966 in the lead-up to the February 1968 unification of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force to form the Canadian Armed Forces. CFB Kingston was placed under Training Command and was responsible for providing a training facilities and support services to its integral units and lodger units.

In September 1975, Training Command was disbanded and the base was transferred to Canadian Forces Training System. The Royal Military College of Canada, the National Defence College, the Canadian Land Force Command and Staff College and the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics were some of the units supported by the base and under the authority of the commander of CFB Kingston. On September 1, 1988, the 1st Canadian Division Headquarters was established to serve as a staging base for the deployment of troops and materiel on active operations; in this role it supported Operation Friction which was Canada&#x27;s support to the United Nations for the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

On March 30, 1995, responsibility for CFB Kingston was transferred to Land Force Command, now known as the Canadian Army (since August 2011).

On June 26, 1997, Air Command reorganized by disbanding the 10 Tactical Air Group and replacing this unit with the newly formed 1 Wing. The headquarters for 1 Wing was relocated to CFB Kingston, however, the unit&#x27;s 6 tactical helicopter squadrons flying the CH-146 Griffon were spread out at Canadian Forces bases across the country.

<doc id="512131" wikidata="Q1639269" url="?curid=512131" title="Focus puller">
<text>A focus puller or first assistant camera (1st AC) is a member of a film crew&#x27;s camera department whose primary responsibility is to maintain the camera lens&#x27;s optical focus on whatever subject or action is being filmed.

&quot;Pulling focus&quot; refers to the act of changing the camera lens&#x27;s focus distance to a moving subject&#x27;s distance from the focal plane, or the changing distance between a stationary object and a moving camera. For example, if an actor moves from to away from the focal plane, the focus puller changes the lens&#x27;s distance setting in precise relation to the actor&#x27;s changing position. The focus puller may also shift focus from one subject to another as the shot requires, a process called &quot;rack focusing&quot;.

==Focus pulling==
There is often very little room for error, depending on the parameters of a given shot. The focus puller&#x27;s role is extremely important to a film production. In most circumstances, a &quot;soft&quot; image is considered unusable, as such an error can&#x27;t be corrected in post-productionwhile it is possible to take detail out of a frame, any detail missed due to incorrect focus is lost. An actor may not be able to duplicate their best performance in a subsequent take, so the focus puller is expected to perform flawlessly on every take.

British cinematographer Oliver Stapleton has written:
== Methodology ==
Once a camera position or overall &quot;shot&quot; is established by the director of photography and camera operator, the 1st AC begins to measure the various distances between the actors&#x27; marks and the focal plane of the camera. These distances are recorded in a series of grease pencil or pen marks on the focus barrel of the lens; similar marks may be placed on the marking disc or ring of any follow focus device being used. Traditionally, the focus puller used only their marks and their own well-developed sense of distance estimation to achieve good results. Over the last decade, the increased use of digital cameras, higher-resolution video taps and on-camera monitors have provided focus pullers with additional tools to help maintain proper focus. A high-definition monitor can be particularly useful when a fast-paced production simply does not allow time for the focus puller to set and check all marks that may be needed, or if no rehearsal will be provided. In most modern use cases, wireless video sender technology is employed to send a high definition or 4K signal directly to the focus puller. 

The 1st AC may take surveying measurements of the general environment in order to have a good idea of the distances between reference points, such as patterns on the floor or walls, furniture, and whatever else might be around. These reference measurements can be used to quickly establish rough distances between the camera and the subject in chaotic shooting circumstances.

The 1st AC reports to the director of photography, works alongside the camera operator, and oversees the 2nd assistant camera (also known as the &quot;clapper loader&quot;) and any other members of the camera department.

<text>Bertram Jay Turetzky (born February 14, 1933) is a contemporary American double bass (contrabass) soloist, composer, teacher, and author of &quot;The Contemporary Contrabass&quot; (1974, 1989), a book that looked at a number of new and interesting ways of playing the double bass including featuring it as a solo performance vehicle with no other instrumental accompaniment.

==Career==
Turetzky has performed and recorded more than 300 pieces written by and for him. His interpretations of early music and composers like Domenico Dragonetti have achieved some prominence. Music critic Michael Steinberg has praised his continuo playing. Turetzky has appeared as a featured soloist in the major music centers of the world and is the most widely recorded solo doublebass player with seven albums on Advance, Ars Nova, Nonesuch, Takoma, Desto and Finnadar music labels.

Turetzky is a versatile musician, conversant in chamber music, baroque music, classical, jazz, renaissance music, improvisational music and many different genres of world music. He has also developed a special affinity for klezmer music.

In addition to &quot;The Contemporary Contrabass&quot;, Turetzky has co-edited a book series called &quot;The New Instrumentation&quot;; seven of a planned eight volumes have been finished. Turetzky wrote an introduction to &quot;The Autobiography of Pops Foster: New Orleans Jazz Man&quot; which spoke to the early development of jazz bass playing.

Bernard Jacobson of the Chicago Daily News described Turestzky as &quot;a virtuoso of caliber unsurpassed by any other practitioner of his instrument today.&quot;

== Biography ==
Turetzky was born in Norwich, Connecticut, United States, and grew up there. He received a master&#x27;s degree in music history from the University of Hartford. In his youth, he was drawn to classic jazz music, playing professionally in that style at his first performances. His aspiration to be a jazz player was encouraged by many of the older swing stars. Turetzky continues to play classic jazz, and appears regularly at jazz festivals.

Turetzky first recorded in 1964, featuring the work of American composers George Perle, Edgard Varèse, Donald Martino, Kenneth Gaburo, Ben Johnston, and an early instrument and tape piece by Charles Whittenburg. Recording activities continued with records on labels Nonesuch, Son Nova, Ars Antigua, and Desto. He has worked with Charles Mingus, and has made a series of recent recordings on the Nine Winds label with improvisational musicians George E. Lewis, Vinny Golia, Wadada Leo Smith, Mike Wofford and others.

Turetzky is a Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Music at the University of California, San Diego.
His former students include bass virtuosos Mark Dresser and Karl E. H. Seigfried; Dresser now holds Turetzky&#x27;s former UCSD faculty position, while Seigfried is working with Turetzky on the latter&#x27;s autobiography.

He is married to flutist Nancy Turetzky, and they have two sons and a daughter, and live in Del Mar, California.

He also plays the guitar, piano, and banjo.

<text>Johann Georg Justus Perthes (11 September 1749 – 2 May 1816) was a German publisher and founder of the publishing house that bears his name.

==Life==
He was born in the Thuringian town of Rudolstadt, the son of a Schwarzburg court physician. From 1778 he worked as a bookseller in nearby Gotha, where he founded the cartographic publishing firm &quot;Justus Perthes Geographische Anstalt Gotha&quot; in 1785. In this, he was joined in 1814 by his son Wilhelm Perthes (1793–1853), who had been in the publishing house of Justus&#x27;s nephew Friedrich Christoph Perthes at Hamburg. On Justus&#x27; death in Gotha, Wilhelm took over the firm and laid the foundation of the geographical branch of the business for which it is chiefly famous, by the first publishing of the &quot;Hand-Atlas&quot; from 1817–1823 after Adolf Stieler (1775–1836).

Wilhelm Perthes engaged the collaboration of the most eminent German geographers of the time, including Stieler, Heinrich Berghaus (1797–1884), Christian Gottlieb Reichard (1758–1837), who was associated with Stieler in the compilation of the atlas, Karl Spruner (1803–1892), and Emil von Sydow (1812–1873).

The business passed to his grandson Bernhardt Wilhelm Perthes (1821–1857), who was associated with August Heinrich Petermann under whose direction the well-known periodical &quot;Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen&quot; was first edited in 1855, and Bruno Hassenstein (1839–1902); and in the next generation to his son Bernhard Perthes (1858–1919), who was born after his father Bernhardt Wilhelm had died.

Since 1785 the firm also issued the Almanach de Gotha, a statistical, historical and genealogical annual (in German and French) of the various countries of the world (first published by Carl Wilhelm Ettinger, Gotha, in 1763); and in 1866 the elaborate &quot;Geographisches Jahrbuch&quot; was produced under the editorship of Ernst Behm (1830–1884), on whose death it was continued under that of Professor Hermann Wagner.

<text>Nelson Webster Dewey (December 19, 1813July 21, 1889) was an American lawyer, land speculator, politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He was the first Governor of Wisconsin, and also served in the Wisconsin Senate and served several years in the Wisconsin Territory government before Wisconsin achieved statehood. He was also particularly important in the development of Cassville, Wisconsin, which he had at one time hoped to make the state capitol.

== Early life ==
Dewey was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, on December 19, 1813, to Ebenezer and Lucy (née Webster) Dewey. His father&#x27;s family had lived in New England since 1633, when their ancestor Thomas Due (Dewey) came to America from Kent County, England.

Dewey&#x27;s family moved to Butternuts, New York (now called Morris) the year following his birth and he attended school there and in Louisville, New York. At the age of 16, he began attending the Hamilton Academy in Hamilton, New York. He attended the academy for three years, and then returned to Butternut to teach.

Ebenezer Dewey, Dewey&#x27;s father, was a lawyer, and wished his son to join the same profession. Dewey began studying law in 1833, first with his father, then with the law firm Hanen &amp; Davies, then with Samuel S. Bowne in Cooperstown, New York. He left Bowne in May 1836, and in June of that year arrived in the lead-mining region of Galena, Illinois, working as a clerk for Daniels, Dennison &amp; Co., a firm of land speculators from New York. About a week after he arrived, he moved to Cassville, Wisconsin. He became a citizen of the territory in 1836. Daniels, Dennison &amp; Co. had purchased the land on which Cassville was built, and their plan was to develop and promote the village in the hopes that it grow and eventually be chosen as the capital of the Wisconsin Territory or of a future state.

== Territorial politics ==

On March 4, 1837, Dewey was elected Register of Deeds for the newly formed Grant County; he was appointed the county&#x27;s Justice of the Peace by Territorial Governor Henry Dodge the same year. He was, and continued to be for the rest of his political career, a member of the Democratic Party. When Daniels, Dennison &amp; Co.&#x27;s business plans collapsed in 1838, after Madison was chosen to be the capital, Dewey moved to Lancaster, Wisconsin, where he was admitted to the bar in an examination held by Charles Dunn, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Wisconsin Territory; he was appointed district attorney of Grant County that same year. As a lawyer, he entered into a partnership with J. Allen Barber, which lasted from 1840 until May 1848. Together, they became well known in Wisconsin&#x27;s lead-mining region, acquiring mines and investing in mining companies.

In November 1838, Dewey was elected to the territorial assembly as representative from Grant County; he was reelected in 1840 and became that body&#x27;s speaker for one session. He served as an assemblyman until 1842, when the voters of Grant County elected him to the territorial council; during the 1846 session, during which an upcoming convention which would produce a draft constitution for the State of Wisconsin was discussed, he served as the council&#x27;s president. He failed to be re-elected in 1846, due to a new Whig majority in Grant County.

== Governor of Wisconsin ==

=== 1848 election ===

With the pending ratification of the new Constitution of Wisconsin, and the upcoming election for the new state&#x27;s officers, the Democratic Party held a convention to nominate its candidate for Governor of Wisconsin. During the writing and attempts at ratification of the state&#x27;s constitution in 1847 and 1848, the state party had become divided into two major factions, one centered in the lead-mining regions, and another centered in the eastern portion of the state. Each faction favored its own candidate for governor: Hiram Barber from the lead-region faction and Morgan L. Martin from the eastern faction; after neither candidate could gather enough votes to secure the nomination, the two factions began searching for a compromise candidate. They decided on Nelson Dewey, who was not associated with either faction. The party also hoped that Dewey might attract voters from the then-Whig majority Grant County.

The election was held on May 8, 1848; Dewey defeated Whig candidate John Hubbard Tweedy and the independent Charles Durkee, and thus became the first governor of the State of Wisconsin. John E. Holmes, also a Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor in the same election.

Also in May, Dewey&#x27;s law and business partnership with Barber came to an end; by the time of its dissolution, Dewey was known to be one of the leading men in Wisconsin.

=== First term ===
Dewey&#x27;s first term as governor began on June 7, 1848, and lasted until January 7, 1850. During his time as governor, Dewey oversaw the transition from the territorial to the new state government. He encouraged the development of the state&#x27;s infrastructure, particularly the construction of new roads, railroads, canals, and harbors, as well as the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. During his administration, the State Board of Public Works was organized.

Dewey was known for opposing the spread of slavery into new states and territories and for advocating the popular election of U.S. Senators.

Near the end of his term, he married Catherine Dunn, (or Katherine) the daughter of Charles Dunn, the former chief justice of Wisconsin Territory.

=== 1849 election ===

During Dewey&#x27;s first term as governor, the Wisconsin Legislature passed an act decreeing that the biennial elections for governor would begin in 1849; that year, in an election held in November, Dewey again defeated the Whig candidate, Alexander Collins, and the Free Soiler Warren Chase. Samuel W. Beall, also a Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor in the same election.

Dewey was elected the first president of the Wisconsin Historical Society the same year.

=== Second term ===
Dewey&#x27;s second term began on January 7, 1850 and lasted until January 5, 1852.

Dewey lost much popular support during his terms as governor, due both to his inability to overcome the factionalism within his own party and to his association with Wisconsin&#x27;s lead-mining regions, which were losing power in Wisconsin politics. He chose not to run for a third term.

== Later life ==
After his time as governor, Dewey returned to Lancaster, where he speculated in real estate. He remained active in politics, however: in 1853, Dewey ran against Chief Justice Orasmus Cole for a seat in the Wisconsin State Senate for Wisconsin&#x27;s Sixteenth District; he was elected by a majority of three votes, serving a two-year term. Throughout the remainder of his life, he was a delegate to most of the state conventions of the Democratic Party. From 1854 until 1865, he was regent of the University of Wisconsin. During his time in Lancaster, Dewey served at various times as the chairman of the town board of supervisor and a member of the school board.

In 1854, Dewey and his wife Catherine began to plan to begin anew the development of Cassville, once the goal of Daniels, Dennison &amp; Co. In 1855, he was able to purchase the village under foreclosure; he remodelled the village plot and repaired the Denniston House, a hotel which had been built by the now-defunct firm, at a cost of $15,000; his ultimate hope was that Cassville would be developed into a large city. He also acquired about of land northwest of Cassville, on which he built a three-story Gothic-revival mansion, which he named &quot;Stonefield&quot;, at a cost of about $70,000; he expended another $30,000 on eleven miles (18 km) of stone fence. It was said that to have been the most modern house in Wisconsin at that time. At this time, Dewey employed around forty to fifty men as a means of returning money to Cassville; it is said that this was the origin of the prosperity of several of Cassville&#x27;s residents.

Dewey lived in Cassville for the rest of his life, except the time from 1858 until 1863, when he lived at Platteville, Wisconsin. In 1863, Dewey unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor; he also lost his 1869 and 1871 attempts at re-election to State Senate.

Dewey&#x27;s Cassville project was attracting few people, so he began investing in a railroad line to the village. On January 2, 1873, Dewey&#x27;s mansion was destroyed in a fire, and he was forced to give up the property to pay his creditors. His property passed into the ownership of Walter C. Newberry of Chicago. Also this year, Dewey lost his entire investment in the railroad line during the Panic of 1873. At some time during this period, Dewey was involved in another financial setback involving the estate of the deceased Ben Eastman, a former Congressman, of which he was the executor. Dewey returned to his law practice.

In 1874, Governor William R. Taylor appointed Dewey to the board of directors of the State Prison at Waupun; he served on the board until 1881.

On February 22, 1889, Dewey suffered a stroke while at court in Lancaster. He was paralyzed and was brought home to Cassville the next day. He was not well prior to this, and was apparently aware of the possibility of becoming paralyzed. From the time of his paralysis, he was almost entirely confined to bed. He died in poverty at the Denniston House, which he had helped rebuild, a few minutes past midnight on the morning of July 21, 1889, after being unconscious for the previous forty-eight hours. He was seventy-five years old.

Dewey was at one time considered a wealthy man, but by the time of his death, he had little money. Dewey was buried on July 23, 1889, in the Episcopal cemetery in Lancaster, next to the graves of his brother Orin and his son Charlie.

== Personal life ==
Dewey married Catherine Dunn in 1849 during his first term as governor. The couple had three children: a daughter Katie, whose married name was later Cole, a son, Nelson Jr., who at the time of Dewey&#x27;s death lived in the West, and another son, Charlie, who died in 1869, while still a child.

In 1886, Dewey filed for a divorce from his wife, but the matter never came to trial. Catherine eventually moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where her daughter and son-in-law lived.

Dewey had a brother named William Dewey, who survived him, and another brother, Orin, who died in 1840. He also a third brother, John J. Dewey, who was a physician who lived in Saint Paul, Minnesota and was a member of the Minnesota Territorial Legislature.

Dewey was called a &quot;friend of the poor&quot; and known for his generosity.

== Political views ==
Dewey was a member of the Democratic Party. He opposed the spread of slavery into new states and territories and advocated electing United States senators by popular vote. He was described as one of &quot;the old guard that never surrendered&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Nelson Dewey State Park was created in 1935 using land from Dewey&#x27;s former Stonefield estate.

An 11 mile portion of Wisconsin state highway 81 from Cassville to the intersection of state highway 35 in Grant County was designated Nelson Dewey Memorial Highway by the Wisconsin Legislature.

The former Nelson Dewey Generating Station was named after the governor.

<doc id="512143" wikidata="Q834381" url="?curid=512143" title="Clapper loader">
<text>A clapper loader or second assistant camera (2nd AC) is part of a film crew whose main functions are that of loading the raw film stock into camera magazines, operating the clapperboard (slate) at the beginning of each take, marking the actors as necessary, and maintaining all records and paperwork for the camera department. The name &quot;clapper loader&quot; tends to be used in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, while &quot;second assistant camera&quot; tends to be favored in the United States, but the job is essentially the same whichever title is used. The specific responsibilities and division of labor within the department will almost always vary depending on the circumstances of the shoot.

== Functions ==
Clapper loaders have a very important role as practically the only people on set who directly and physically oversee the state of the undeveloped negative. The loader – the only person who actually handles the negative between the manufacturer and the laboratory – thus can easily render an entire day&#x27;s work useless if the film is handled improperly. Additionally, the loader usually controls all records with regard to the film stock – from when it is received until when it is sent out to the lab; if this information is miscommunicated or missing, this too can destroy an expensive shoot. Furthermore, the loader usually has much more to do in addition to these tasks. Noted director of photography Oliver Stapleton has written on his website:

== Duties ==
A full description of the job duties includes the following (although different shoots may often not always require all of these):
*generally assisting the rest of the camera crew (focus puller, camera operator, director of photography)
*utilizing the camera trainee, film loader, and/or camera runner if one has been brought onto the production
*keeping inventory of all equipment, film, and expendables
*requesting film stock as needed
*securing the equipment
*unloading/loading equipment off/on the camera truck daily if necessary
*checking loading materials and spaces to prevent light leaks
*cleaning and keeping clean the magazines and the loading environment
*organizing and cleaning the equipment space
*maintaining and cleaning the equipment
*loading and unloading of film stock from and to the magazines
*labelling of equipment, boxes, magazines, and storage spaces
*marking actors and props (leaving a marker of their positions as the scene is blocked for the purpose of measuring distance from the camera so that its focus can be adjusted throughout the scene)
*marking and operating the clapperboard properly
*keeping meticulous and accurate camera notes
*writing negative report sheets in detail
*interfacing with continuity in order to note which takes to print
*charging of batteries for camera and accessories
*preparation of film to be sent to the lab
*keeping records of time, per diems, and expenses for the entire camera crew
*liaising regularly with production, rental houses, editing, laboratories, and unions
*recordkeeping of all camera-related paperwork, including negative reports, daily stock reports, film inventory reports, lab orders, rental contracts, and expendable orders
*ensuring that all instructions from the director of photography are passed along properly to labs and post houses
*relaying reports from the lab about the rushes to the director of photography

<doc id="512150" wikidata="Q327106" url="?curid=512150" title="Heracleum (plant)">
<text>Heracleum is a genus of biennial and perennial herbs in the carrot family Apiaceae. They are found throughout the temperate northern hemisphere and in high mountains as far south as Ethiopia. Common names for the genus or its species include hogweed and cow parsnip.

The genus name &quot;Heracleum&quot; was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It derives from the Ancient Greek () &quot;of Heracles&quot;, referring to the mythological hero.

==Species==

Many species of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; are similar in appearance. An outlier is &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot;, the large size of which is exceptional. Common species include:
* &quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot;, giant hogweed, native to the western Caucasus region of Eurasia, a serious invasive species in many areas of Europe and North America
* &quot;Heracleum sosnowskyi&quot;, Sosnowsky&#x27;s hogweed, native to the eastern Caucasus, a common weed throughout Europe and Asia
* &quot;Heracleum persicum&quot;, Persian hogweed, native to Iran, Iraq, and Turkey
* &quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot;, common hogweed, native to Europe and Asia
* &quot;Heracleum maximum&quot;, cow parsnip, native and common in North America

, Plants of the World Online accepts the following 88 species:, it had previously in 2019, up to 148.


==Classification and naming==
Other than size, the related species &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot;, &quot;H. sosnowskyi&quot;, and &quot;H. persicum&quot; have very similar characteristics. The common name giant hogweed usually refers to &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; alone but in some locales that common name refers to all three species as a group. Both &quot;H. maximum&quot; and &quot;H. sphondylium&quot; are often referred to as cow parsnip. To avoid confusion, these species are sometimes referred to as American cow parsnip and European cow parsnip, respectively.

The morphological similarity of species within the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; and the difficulty of botanical identification has led to numerous synonyms and naming issues. For example, the classification of the species now widely known as &quot;H. maximum&quot; has been inconsistent. In the literature, the scientific names &quot;H. lanatum&quot;, &quot;H. maximum&quot;, and others are used interchangeably. Prior to 2000, the former name was most popular, but today the latter name is in vogue.

==Phototoxic effects==
Most species of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; are known to cause phytophotodermatitis. In particular, the public health risks of giant hogweed (&quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot;) are well known.

At least 36 species of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; have been reported to contain furanocoumarin, a chemical compound that sensitizes human skin to sunlight. Of those, at least 25 species contained a psoralen derivative, either bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) or methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen). Three of those species (&quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot;, &quot;H. sosnowskyi&quot;, and &quot;H. sphondylium&quot;) were found to contain both psoralen derivatives.

From 2017 to 2022, he was a regular on the Fox/Hulu sci-fi comedy drama &quot;The Orville&quot; as Gordon Malloy.

As a singer, Grimes is best known for co-writing and performing the soft rock single &quot;Sunset Blvd&quot;, which peaked at number 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;’s Adult Contemporary chart in April 2005. He is also known for being one of the four singers in Russell Crowe&#x27;s band Indoor Garden Party.

==Early life ==
Grimes was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the son of Pam and Rick Grimes. He lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until he was 10, when he moved to Dracut, Massachusetts and attended Dracut Public Schools. His sister, Heather Grimes, is also an actress. He is the uncle of Camryn Grimes, who is known for her roles as Cassie Newman and Mariah Copeland on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

==Career==
Grimes started acting at an early age. In 1984, at the age of 13, he co-starred with Mickey Rooney in a made-for-TV holiday movie titled &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear.&quot; In 1985, he appeared in an episode of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; called &quot;Little Boy Lost.&quot;

Grimes also began singing in childhood, and in March 1986 appeared on a Bob Hope TV special &quot;Bob Hope&#x27;s Royal Command Performance from Sweden&quot;, singing &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow.&quot; The special was taped in Sweden with the King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia in attendance. In 1987, he performed as a guest vocalist on the &quot;Time&quot; album by Richard Carpenter of The Carpenters, where Carpenter thanked the 15-year-old Grimes for his &quot;spirited&quot; performance on the song &quot;That&#x27;s What I Believe&quot;, commenting in the liner notes, &quot;I believe young Scott to have quite a future in music.&quot; Grimes&#x27; first music album, &quot;Scott Grimes&quot; was released by A&amp;M Records in 1989, with the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Even Mind&quot; produced by Carpenter. In 2005, he released his second album, &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Run,&quot; and in 2010 his third, &quot;Drive.&quot;

During the 1986-1987 TV season, Grimes played Jack Randall on the CBS sitcom &quot;Together We Stand&quot;, which was revamped and retitled &quot;Nothing is Easy&quot; during its only season on the air. In 1987, Grimes voiced Pinocchio in the dark animated film &quot;Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night.&quot; In 1988, he appeared with Dwayne Hickman, Connie Stevens, and her daughter Tricia Leigh Fisher in the TV movie &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot;; Grimes, Hickman, Stevens, and Fisher also appeared on the &quot;All-Star Super Password Special&quot; with Bert Convy.

Initially a recurring character on &quot;ER&quot;, he later was upgraded to a main role in season 12. The character initially provided comic relief, but grew over the years, becoming central to several episodes and story lines in the series&#x27; final seasons.

Since 2005, Grimes has voiced Steve Smith in the American animated sitcom &quot;American Dad!&quot; He has also voiced the recurring characters Midget Assassin and Frat Guy, as well as several additional characters, each of whom appear in only one episode.

<text>Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo is a 1977 American sports adventure comedy film directed by Vincent McEveety and written by Arthur Alsberg and Don Nelson. The film is the third installment in the &quot;Herbie&quot; film series and the sequel to &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974). In the film, Dean Jones returns as champion race car driver Jim Douglas (reprising his role from &quot;The Love Bug&quot;, the first film in the series), joined this time by his somewhat cynical and eccentric riding mechanic Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts). The film follows Douglas, Herbie and Applegate as they participate in the fictional Trans-France Race, a road race from Paris, France, to Monte Carlo, Monaco.

&quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot; was followed by &quot;Herbie Goes Bananas&quot; (1980).

==Plot==

Jim Douglas, his partner and mechanic Wheely Applegate, and Herbie arrive in Paris to qualify for and compete in the Trans-France Race (a fictional version of the Monte Carlo Rally), in the hopes of staging a career comeback. The team has three major opponents in the race: Bruno von Stickle (Eric Braeden), a German driver with experience in the &quot;European Racing Circuit&quot;, Claude Gilbert (Mike Kulcsar), a French driver, and Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars), a beautiful young woman and the only female driver in the Trans-France Race.

Herbie falls in love at first sight with Giselle, Diane&#x27;s sentient Lancia Scorpion. Diane initially hates Jim for what was apparently his, but actually was Herbie&#x27;s knee-jerk behavior that ruin her chances of succeeding during the first qualifying rounds, as strong-willed Diane does not appear to believe in any cars that can be alive and have a mind of their own. Herbie and Giselle go on a &#x27;date&#x27; together, and the following day, both cars qualify successfully for the race, Herbie performing donuts across the line in a bid to impress Giselle.

Meanwhile, two diamond thieves, Max (Bernard Fox) and Quincy (Roy Kinnear), steal the famous &quot;Étoile de Joie&quot; (French for &quot;Star of Joy&quot;) diamond and hide it in Herbie&#x27;s fuel tank in order to avoid being captured by a swarm of searching policemen. They attempt to steal Herbie to retrieve the diamond, but Herbie causes them to blow every chance they get. The pair even threaten Jim and Wheely at gunpoint, an encounter from which Herbie manages to escape by driving through a gypsy camp and a building site. Wheely assumes Diane hired the two goons to knock them out of the race, causing a misunderstanding between Jim and Diane. Herbie is also taken into protection by the French police, headed by inspector Bouchet (Jacques Marin) and his eager junior officer Fontenoy (Xavier Saint-Macary), causing them to miss the start of the race the following day. Giselle also refuses to start the race without Herbie, much to Diane&#x27;s exasperation, but does so after Wheely lies to Giselle that Herbie has broken up with her. When Fontenoy eventually arrives with Herbie, Wheely also lies to Herbie that Giselle did the same to persuade Herbie to start the race, albeit from last place.

After numerous setbacks and delays, including another run in with the thieves, Herbie, Jim and Wheely race back into contention. After Diane and Giselle crash into a lake, Herbie turns around and charges back to save them, after Jim reveals Wheely had lied to him. After being rescued by Herbie and Jim, Diane&#x27;s attitude toward Jim softens, and Diane begins to understand that cars can have minds of their own. Herbie refuses to restart because of being determined to stay with Giselle, but Diane encourages Herbie not to relent in the quest for victory in the Trans-France Race, but not before Herbie makes Wheely get down on his knees and apologize for lying to him. With Diane now out of the race, the three pursues Bruno through the streets of Monte Carlo, leading to a thrilling duel for the win. Herbie takes the lead by driving upside down on the tunnel roof of the Monaco Grand Prix circuit, and Jim drives Herbie to victory.
After the race, it is revealed that Bouchet, also known as &quot;Double X&quot; as a code name to the thieves, is the real mastermind behind the museum robbery, though the motive of his scheme is revealed as he also threatens Jim and Wheely at gunpoint, only to be foiled by Herbie rolling onto his foot and knocking the gun out of his hands with his hood. Fontenoy, having himself unraveled the mystery of the &quot;Étoile de Joie&quot;, has Bouchet clapped in handcuffs and arrested.

In the end, Jim and Diane begin to be in love, as so does Wheely and the Monte Carlo trophy girl. Most of all, Herbie and Giselle fall in love again as well and celebrate Herbie&#x27;s victory by watching a brilliant firework display over the Monte Carlo harbor.

Mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley sent a proclamation officially declaring July 11 as &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo Day&quot; and a floral wreath was presented to Herbie by Miss Monte Carlo. The ceremony was preceded by a parade on Hollywood Boulevard featuring a traditional Chinese band, firecrackers, 25 Lancia sports cars, clowns, cheerleaders and the Goodyear Blimp.

<text>Saparua is an island east of Ambon Island in the Indonesian province of Maluku; the island of Haruku lies between Saparua and Ambon. The main port is in the south at Kota Saparua. The small and uninhabited island of Maolana is located near its southwestern side and Nusa Laut off its southeastern tip.

Saparua was administered as a single eponymous district (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) of Central Maluku Regency (&quot;Kabupaten Maluku Tengah&quot;), but in 2012 an additional district of East Saparua was formed from the eastern peninsula of the original district. Kota Saparua (Saparua town) is the administrative centre of the residual (western) district, while Tuhaha is the administrative centre of the new district.

The island (including Maolana island) covers a land area of 168.1 km2, and had a population of 32,312 as of the 2010 census and 36,022 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 34,480. The inhabitants of Saparua speak the Saparua language, as well as Indonesian and Ambonese Malay.

Saparua was the location of Indonesian national hero, Pattimura&#x27;s rebellion against Dutch forces in 1817. It was also the birthplace of Gerrit Augustinus Siwabessy, a prominent politician who was Indonesia&#x27;s Minister of Health during the 1960s and 1970s.

== Villages on Saparua ==
There are 17 administrative villages, listed below with their populations at the 2020 Census; ten comprise the new district of East Saparua, while seven remain with the residual Saparua District in the west of the island.
The areas (in km2) and 2020 Census populations of each of these, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023, are as follows:

<text>Wissahickon Creek is a tributary of the Schuylkill River in Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania.

Wissahickon Creek rises in Montgomery County, runs approximately passing through and dividing Northwest Philadelphia before emptying into the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia. Its watershed covers about .

Much of the creek now runs through or next to parkland, with the last few miles running through a deep gorge. The beauty of this area attracted the attention of literary personages like Edgar Allan Poe and John Greenleaf Whittier. The gorge area is now part of Wissahickon Valley Park in Philadelphia, and the Wissahickon Valley is known as one of 600 National Natural Landmarks of the United States.

The name of the creek comes from the Lenape word wiessahitkonk, for &quot;catfish creek&quot; or &quot;stream of yellowish color&quot;. On the earliest map of this region of Pennsylvania, by Thomas Holme, the stream is called &quot;Whitpaine&#x27;s creek&quot;, after one of the original settlers Richard Whitpaine, who owned several large tracts on the creek. Whitpaine was an early land owner in the days of William Penn.

==Geography and recreation==

Though at first fairly tame, in its last , the Wissahickon stream drops over in altitude. Its dramatic geography and dense forest attract thousands of walkers, riders, and bikers.

Devil&#x27;s Pool is a swimming area on the mouth of Cresheim Creek. As the ravine widens into the Cresheim, the waters gather in a basin surrounded on either side by rocky outcroppings before flowing into the Wissahickon Creek. Legend has it that the Native American Lenape tribes used this as a spiritual area, where local author Phyllis Knapp Thomas writes that &quot;...the Good Spirit is claimed to have banished the Evil Spirit into deep, dark waters&quot;. Although it is not legal due to unsafe levels of pollutants, Devil&#x27;s pool has become a popular area to swim, lounge, and drink. Unfortunately, Devil&#x27;s pool often falls victim to litter and vandalism. However, recent efforts to clean the site by the Friends of the Wissahickon have been moderately successful.

Another outlook in the park is Mom Rinker&#x27;s Rock, on a ridge on the eastern side of the Park just north of the Walnut Lane Bridge.

==Geology==
A tremendous variety of geology is evident along Wissahickon Creek. Three of the geologic regions that the stream passes through are the Newark Basin of Triassic sandstone and shale, the limestone and dolomite of the Chester Valley, and the Wissahickon Formation where the waters of the stream flow into the Schuylkill and eventually the Delaware Rivers.

A unique and very distinctive rock of the Wissahickon Creek valley is Wissahickon schist, the predominant bedrock underlying the Philadelphia region, found over a broad swath of southeastern Pennsylvania from Trenton into Delaware and Maryland. This Precambrian to Cambrian stone, first studied in the Wissahickon gorge, has flecks of glittery mica, small garnets, and many-toned shadings of gray, brown, tan, and blue, and is attractive enough to have become a common building material in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In addition to Wissahickon schist, there are layers of quartzite in the valley. Both schist and quartzite are metamorphic rocks formed from sedimentary deposits of mud and sand that one time were washed from ancient continents into a shallow sea. These sedimentary deposits were over time compressed into shale and sandstone. During long periods of mountain building, the shale and sandstone were slowly transformed into the schist and quartzite found today. In some places, the compression and heat were extreme enough to fuse the schist with emerging igneous rocks into hard-banded gneiss.

Other rocks in the valley are layers of igneous pegmatite and remains of granite plutons, embedded crystals within the schist. A few locations close to Devil&#x27;s Pool and along Bell&#x27;s Mill Road have a talc schist which contains the mineral talc, so soft it can be scratched with a fingernail.

==History==
===Johannes Kelpius===
In 1694, Johannes Kelpius arrived in Philadelphia with a group of like-minded German Pietists to live in the valley of the Wissahickon Creek. They formed a monastic community and became known as the Hermits or Mystics of the Wissahickon. Kelpius was a musician, writer, and occultist. He frequently meditated (some believe in a cave—the &quot;Cave of Kelpius&quot; ) along the banks of the Wissahickon and awaited the end of the world, which was expected in 1694. No sign or revelation accompanied that year, but the faithful continued to live in celibacy by the stream, searching the stars and hoping for the end. Kelpius described the type of meditation he used in his &quot;Method of Prayer.&quot; (See Further Reading below on this book.) Kelpius died in 1708 and the group disbanded some time thereafter. Some members likely gave up on celibacy and married. A few joined the somewhat like-minded religious colony of Ephrata Cloister under Conrad Beissel in Ephrata, Lancaster County, even though no previous connection existed between the two communities. At least two from the original group, Johann Seelig and Konrad Matthaei, continued as hermits along the Wissahickon into the 1740s.

Other religious groups were also associated with the Wissahickon: On Christmas Day in 1723 the first congregation of the Church of the Brethren in America – often called Dunkard Brethren – baptized several new members in the stream. Around 1747, an individual with connections to both the Dunkards and the Ephrata Cloister built a stone house on land previously owned by Dunkards. The structure, used for church retreats, still stands today, and is known as &quot;The Monastery&quot;, a remaining witness to the Wissahickon&#x27;s days as an isolated religious refuge.

===Development===
The same steep slopes and gorge that provided an attractive isolation to religious adherents in the 17th and early 18th centuries provided an efficient source of energy for the development of water mills in later years. One miller had by 1690 already constructed a dam, sawmill, gristmill, and house by the narrow shelf of land at the confluence of the Wissahickon with the Schuylkill River, but the rugged terrain of the valley forestalled further development alongside the stream itself. By 1730, however, eight mills had been constructed, and by 1793, twenty-four, along with many dams. Most of America was still wilderness, but the Wissahickon Valley was a developing industrial center. There were more than fifty watermills by 1850, though the thickly forested region about the stream still retained the character of a wilderness. Access roads were being constructed into the steep valley, but there was still no road that followed the stream itself. The nature of the rugged terrain can be comprehended in an event that had occurred during the Revolutionary War Battle of Germantown, which was fought not too far from the stream. The American General John Armstrong, compelled by the rough terrain to abandon a cannon in the valley, expressed his contempt for the &quot;horrendous hills of the Wissahickon.&quot; Later legends tell of American spies taking advantage of the terrain to retrieve information from an informant named &quot;Mom Rinker&quot;, who allegedly perched atop a rock overlooking the valley to drop balls of yarn which contained messages about British troop movements during the occupation of Philadelphia. This is likely a legend, for other stories speak of a witch named &quot;Mom Rinkle&quot; who had little to do with the Revolution. There is a Mom Rinker&#x27;s Rock in the park today.

Not until 1826 were the cliffs near the creek&#x27;s mouth blasted away to provide access to the cluster of mills at Rittenhousetown, approximately up the creek on Paper Mill Run (also known as Monoshone Creek), a small tributary of the Wissahickon. Here William Rittenhouse (grandfather of the astronomer David Rittenhouse) had in the early 18th century built the first paper mill in America. Gradually this road and other mill access roads were connected, and in 1856 a private toll road, the Wissahickon Turnpike, linked the entire valley. Long gone were the religious mystics; here instead the mills of Wissahickon Creek made paper, cloth, gunpowder, sawed lumber, milled wheat and corn, and pressed oil from flax. A sizable population worked at the mills and lived in the valley in small villages like Rittenhousetown and Pumpkinville. The nation was becoming an industrial nation, and the Wissahickon was leading the way.

Benjamin Franklin already had noted in his will the high elevation and quality of Wissahickon water, proposing that in some future day the stream be dammed to supply a safe and pure water source for Philadelphia&#x27;s water supply, and even allocating funds for this purpose. This did not happen, but the quest for pure water affected the Wissahickon&#x27;s subsequent history. Seeking to prevent the stream&#x27;s industrial discharges from affecting the purity of the water of the Schuylkill River, the Fairmount Park Commission took title of much of the land along the Wissahickon in 1869-1870, and continued to expand its holdings in subsequent decades. The mills were razed; the last active mill was demolished in 1884. Several decades later the Schuylkill River itself became seriously polluted by sources in the coal fields far upstream beyond Philadelphia&#x27;s control, but the waters of the Wissahickon had been restored and the beauty of the Wissahickon Valley had been preserved. Most of America became more industrialized, but the Wissahickon valley quietly returned to its original wilderness character.

The reason the Wissahickon Valley retained its wilderness character, even after its clean waters were no longer essential to the water supply of the city of Philadelphia, was the advent of Romanticism and the changing attitudes which this thought engendered about nature. Before the 19th century, nature had seemed a capricious and ambivalent force, at times a dream, but at times a nightmare. Nature, according to orthodox Christian thought, had fallen with man; though the Renaissance brought about both a new view of mankind and nature, this new attitude took time to grow, but it eventually resulted in a literary and artistic movement known as Romanticism. Romantics valued heroism and chivalry in people, and regarded the wild, free, and untamed nature as the &quot;natural&quot; model of true beauty. Philadelphians finally came to value their Wissahickon valley for its wild character. Even when the mills were still operating, there were remote stretches of wild bluffs and overarching trees; now the old mills had become romantic and picturesque, with mossy stone walls suggesting medieval ruins. In 1924, area residents formed the non-profit group &quot;Friends of the Wissahickon&quot;, which still works to maintain the park&#x27;s unique landscape to this day. Remarks on the Wissahickon in literature by such as Fanny Kemble, Edgar Allan Poe, George Lippard, and others are noted below.

However much the stream and its valley were appreciated, it still divided parts of the city. To help overcome this, in 1906 the Walnut Lane Bridge was built over the stream, which was the world&#x27;s largest concrete arch bridge at the time. The bridge joined the Roxborough and Germantown neighborhoods of Philadelphia, formerly separated by the Wissahickon gorge. The bridge is but long, with a width of , but its center arch spans an impressive , the crown of the arch is above the water, and the sidewalks of the bridge above the Wissahickon.

=== Wissahickon Day ===
In the past, there was an annual parade of horses, riders, and carriage annually in May for Wissahickon Day, a festive Gala popular among Philadelphia&#x27;s Equestrians and social elites.

===Wissahickon Memorial Bridge===

The Wissahickon Memorial Bridge, also known as Henry Avenue Bridge, is a stone and concrete bridge that carries Henry Avenue over Wissahickon Creek, joining Roxborough and the East Falls-Germantown neighborhoods in Philadelphia. It was completed in 1932 and is long, wide, and above water. It was originally designed to carry a planned extension of a subway into Roxborough, but the subway never reached the bridge. The bridge has been known as a suicide bridge since its opening. Beginning in 1941 for an unknown duration of time a policeman patrolled the span, questioning all pedestrians walking the bridge.

===Fairmount Park===

Once the stream enters the city of Philadelphia, the creek valley and its deeply wooded gorge form part of the Fairmount Park system in Philadelphia, a jewel of a park and of nature set in the middle of an urban landscape. The park here is a ruggedly beautiful valley for the naturalists, artists, fishermen, bicyclists, equestrians, and hikers who are drawn to the wooded, steep banks of the stream. Precipitous wooded inclines that rise more than above the water create a feeling of remoteness and mountain vastness. There are two main and many smaller bridle paths crossing the park&#x27;s along the Wissahickon Creek. Thomas Mill Covered Bridge, the only covered bridge in a major US city, spans the creek in the park. The Wissahickon Valley is one of fewer than 600 National Natural Landmarks in America. Recently, interest in reintroducing brook trout to the Wissahickon Valley portion of Fairmount park has been growing.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
Among the earliest references to the valley was by William Cobbett in his book &quot;Rural Rides&quot;, which takes the form of a series of letters. In one dated 1821 he said,

Actress Fanny Kemble, grandmother to novelist Owen Wister, visited the stream in 1832; her writing awakened a more general interest in the stream and its valley. Her description of the gorge&#x27;s dramatic end at the stream&#x27;s confluence with the Schuylkill River and her verse &quot;To the Wissahickon&quot; both sparked a keen interest in this natural treasure often overlooked by its neighbors. She wrote:

The thick, bright, rich-tufted cedars, basking in the warm amber glow, the picturesque mill, the smooth open field, along whose side the river waters, after receiving this child of the mountains into their bosom, wound deep, and bright, and still, the whole radiant with the softest light I ever beheld, formed a most enchanting and serene subject of contemplation.

Edgar Allan Poe alluded to Fanny Kemble&#x27;s writing in his description of a beautiful Wissahickon valley in his 1844 essay &quot;Morning on the Wissahiccon&quot;, in which he wrote:

Now the Wissahiccon is of so remarkable a loveliness that, were it flowing in England, it would be the theme of every bard, and the common topic of every tongue, if, indeed, its banks were not parcelled off in lots, at an exorbitant price, as building-sites for the villas of the opulent. Yet it is only within a very few years that any one has more than heard of the Wissahiccon ... the brook is narrow. Its banks are generally, indeed almost universally, precipitous, and consist of high hills, clothed with noble shrubbery near the water, and crowned at a greater elevation, with some of the most magnificent forest trees of America, among which stands conspicuous the &quot;liriodendron tulipiferum&quot;. The immediate shores, however, are of granite, sharply defined or moss-covered, against which the pellucid water lolls in its gentle flow, as the blue waves of the Mediterranean upon the steps of her palaces of marble.

The erratic and almost forgotten novelist George Lippard frequently wrote about the Wissahickon, and was even married at sunset on or around May 14, 1847, on a rocky crag called Mom Rinker&#x27;s Rock, overlooking the stream. One of his books, &quot;The Rose of Wissahikon; or, The Fourth of July, 1776. A Romance, Embracing the Secret History of the Declaration of Independence&quot; (1847) may refer not only to the Wissahickon, but to his wife, the former Rose Newman. He wrote:

A poem of everlasting beauty and a dream of magnificance – the world-hidden, wood embowered Wissahickon.

Depending on one of Lippard&#x27;s mostly contrived stories, John Greenleaf Whittier wrote about Johannes Kelpius and his followers on the Wissahickon in his 1872 poem &quot;&quot;:

Christopher Morley also portrayed the valley&#x27;s beauty in his writings.

The Wissahickon is mentioned very briefly in &quot;A Biography of the Poet, Sidney Lanier&quot; by Edwin Mims.

Mark Twain mentioned the Wissahickon during the short time he spent in Philadelphia working for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;: &quot;Unlike New York, I like this Philadelphia amazingly, and the people in it ... I saw small steamboats, with their signs up—&quot;For Wissahickon and Manayunk 25 cents&quot;. Geo. Lippard, in his &quot;Legends of Washington and his Generals,&quot; has rendered the Wissahickon sacred in my eyes, and I shall make that trip, as well as one to Germantown, soon ...&quot;

Ron P. Swegman, a fly fishing angler, artist, and author, wrote extensively about Wissahickon Creek in two illustrated essay collections, Philadelphia on the Fly (Frank Amato Publications, 2005) and Small Fry: The Lure of the Little (The Whitefish Press, 2009). Both books describe the Wissahickon Valley and the experience of fly fishing along Wissahickon Creek in the early twenty-first century.

<text>The University of Wisconsin–Whitewater (UW–Whitewater or UWW) is a public university in Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the University of Wisconsin System. As of Fall 2024, the university offers 47 undergraduate majors and 13 graduate programs and enrolls approximately 11,000 students. Approximately 1,400 faculty and staff are employed by the university, and the student body consists of individuals from about 40 US states and 30 countries. After the 2018 UW System Restructuring, the University of Wisconsin-Rock County began operating as the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater at Rock County, a 2-year branch campus located in Janesville, Wisconsin.

==History==
On April 21, 1868, the school was named Whitewater Normal School and graduated its first class of teachers in June 1870.

A unique tradition of the school was known as &quot;Students&#x27; Day.&quot; One day during the term, faculty would, unannounced, be entirely absent. Once students recognized that the day must be &quot;Students&#x27; Day&quot;, they would elect a President and Faculty from amongst themselves who would take up the regular duties of the day. The annual catalogue stated the purpose of &quot;Students&#x27; Day&quot; as the following: &quot;The object of thus putting the institution under the care of the students is to test their moral culture, their executive ability, and their devotion to their work.&quot;

In 1927, the school received authority to grant baccalaureate degrees in education and its name was changed to Whitewater Teachers College. With the addition of the liberal arts programs in 1951 it became Wisconsin State College–Whitewater, and was later designated a Wisconsin State University in 1964, the Wisconsin State University–Whitewater.

In 1971, after the merger of the former University of Wisconsin and the former Wisconsin State Universities, the school became part of the University of Wisconsin System and has been called the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater since.

==Campus==

The University of Wisconsin–Whitewater encompasses in southeastern Wisconsin. The landmark of the university&#x27;s campus, Old Main, was destroyed by fire on February 7, 1970. The school&#x27;s oldest building, it was the only one that had been part of the original campus. The east wing of Old Main, now called Hyer Hall, is all that remains of the building. It houses many of the university&#x27;s administrative offices, in addition to classrooms and lecture halls. After the fire that destroyed Old Main, the building&#x27;s carillon bell was removed and installed in front of the Alumni Center. Now, an electronic carillon bell rings regularly throughout the day.

The James R. Connor University Center occupies the heart of campus. The &quot;UC&quot; contains a bowling alley, an art gallery, a stage for live music, a coffee shop, and several dining options. Young Auditorium, the largest performing arts venue on campus, hosts dance, music, theatre, comedy, and other university events. The UW-Whitewater Nature Preserve is located in the northeast corner of campus and consists of 110 acres of various ecosystems such as woodlands, wetlands, and prairie. In addition to serving as an outdoor classroom and laboratory, the preserve includes recreational trails for running, hiking, cross-country skiing, or biking.

==Student life==
The University of Wisconsin–Whitewater has over 180 recognized student clubs and organizations.

=== Student Government ===
Whitewater Student Government (WSG) is the students&#x27; governing body. WSG is split into two branches of government, the Executive Branch headed by the President and the Legislative Branch, also known as the Senate, headed by the Speaker of the Senate. The WSG Senate will recommend the annual Allocable Segregated Fee every fall semester to be presented to the Chancellor of the institution, pending final approval from the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. The power to determine a recommended allocation to WSG is vested in the Segregated University Fee Allocation Committee(SUFAC).

===Greek life===
As of Fall 2024, there are 24 Greek organizations recognized by the university. They fall under 4 different Greek Councils, the Interfraternity Council(IFC), the Intercultural Greek Council(IGC), National PanHellenic Council(NPHC), and the PanHellenic Council(PHC).

===Media===
&quot;The Royal Purple&quot; is the university&#x27;s independent student newspaper; its first issue was printed in 1901.

UWW-TV is the university&#x27;s student-run television channel. It is located on channel 100.1 in high definition. It is also available around the city of Whitewater on Spectrum cable channel 989.

91.7 The Edge is the campus&#x27;s student-run radio station, broadcasting out of Andersen Library since 1966.

== Academics ==
The University of Wisconsin–Whitewater is split into four undergraduate colleges at the Whitewater Campus and one at the Rock County Campus and a graduate school. These include the:

* College of Arts and Communication
* College of Business and Economics
* College of Education and Professional Studies
* College of Integrated Studies

UW–Whitewater is a member of NCAA Division III for athletics. It is a part of the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC). The university&#x27;s athletics teams are nicknamed the &quot;Warhawks&quot; and are represented by the colors purple and white.

In the 2013–14 academic year, the Warhawks won the men&#x27;s football, basketball, and baseball championships. UW-Whitewater is the first school in NCAA history in any division to attain such a three-sport sweep in the same academic year.

One of UW-Whitewater&#x27;s programs for students with disabilities, Cornerstones for Success, provides athletes with disabilities the opportunity to share their experiences in sports and everyday life. UW-Whitewater also has wheelchair basketball programs for men and women; both teams have won national championships.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1885, the Wisconsin State Normal School opened for classes at 18th and Wells in downtown Milwaukee. The first president was John Mapel, an alumnus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison who had previously been the superintendent of schools in Iowa. His ideas for the curriculum were largely influenced by a tour he took through Europe prior to his job in Iowa. Over the next 42 years, the Milwaukee State Normal School saw seven different presidents, the addition of music and liberal arts programs and rapid growth from an initial enrollment of 76. In 1919, the school moved from downtown to the current location near the lakefront when a new building, now Mitchell Hall, was completed. In 1927, the Milwaukee normal school changed its name to Wisconsin State Teachers College-Milwaukee in an effort by the State Normal School Regents to refocus on the instruction of teachers. The college became one of the nation&#x27;s top teacher&#x27;s training colleges in the 1940s. In 1951, the Legislature empowered all state colleges to offer liberal arts programs. The Milwaukee State Teachers College subsequently became Wisconsin State College–Milwaukee, but was still casually referred to as &quot;Milwaukee State,&quot; as it had been throughout its previous incarnations; also retaining the green and white school colors and Green Gulls mascot.

===University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee===
University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was founded with the belief that Milwaukee needed a great public university to become a great city. In 1955, the Wisconsin state legislature passed a bill to create a large public university that offered graduate programs in Wisconsin&#x27;s largest city. In 1956, Wisconsin State College-Milwaukee merged with the University of Wisconsin–Extension&#x27;s Milwaukee division (a graduate branch of the University of Wisconsin–Madison) to form the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The new university consisted of the WSC campus near the lakefront and the University of Wisconsin extension building in downtown Milwaukee. The first commencement of the new University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was held on June 16, 1957. On June 13, 1958, Socialist mayor Frank P. Zeidler was the first person to receive an honorary doctorate from the university.

In 1964, the campus of the neighboring private women&#x27;s institution, Milwaukee-Downer College, was purchased by the state to expand the UWM campus; Milwaukee-Downer College had previously merged with Lawrence College to form the present Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. The university had already purchased the former campuses and buildings of the former Milwaukee-Downer Seminary and Milwaukee University School along Hartford Avenue.

From 1956 to 1971, UW–Milwaukee, UW–Madison, and the latter&#x27;s affiliated 10 freshman-sophomore centers and statewide extensions (University of Wisconsin–Extension) were part of the original University of Wisconsin System. In 1971, the state legislature merged this entity with the Wisconsin State Universities to form a united University of Wisconsin System under a single board of regents. In 1988, the UW System designated eight Centers of Excellence at UWM. In 1994, UWM was designated a Research II University (now a Doctoral/Research University-Extensive) by the Carnegie Foundation.

UWM has expanded to 12 schools and colleges and now offers 88 undergraduate programs and 48 graduate programs, including 22 doctoral degree programs, with a university-wide focus on academic research, teaching and community service. In 2005, UW–Milwaukee surpassed UW–Madison in the number of Wisconsin resident students and became the university with the largest enrollment of Wisconsin residents.

In 2006, UW–Milwaukee was ranked as the ninth best &quot;Saviors of Our Cities&quot; by the New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE), because of its strong positive contribution of careful strategic planning and thoughtful use of resources that have dramatically strengthened the economy and quality of life of Milwaukee, and was voted by the public as one of the top ten &quot;Gems of Milwaukee&quot;.

In 2008 and 2009, the school saw the establishments of the School of Public Health and the School of Freshwater Sciences. In 2010, UW–Milwaukee purchased its neighboring Columbia St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital complex. In the early 2011, UW-Milwaukee closed the land purchase for its Innovation Park in Wauwatosa.

==Campus==

The UWM campus is located in a residential area on Milwaukee’s upper East Side. The campus is five blocks from the shoreline of Lake Michigan, and is less than a ten-minute drive from downtown Milwaukee. The Milwaukee County Transit System provides the campus with access to public bus transportation in Milwaukee. The campus is divided into central, north, west, and northwest quads. In addition to the campus proper, UWM incorporates a large number of other sites throughout the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

===Central Quad===
The north end of the Central Quad is the UWM Golda Meir Library, a major library of the country. The library consists of three parts: the West Wing, East Wing and the conference center on the top level of the East Wing. The West Wing and the East Wing were completed in 1967 and 1974 separately. The two structures are joined by passageways in the basement and on the second and third floors. The northern extensions of the East and West Wings and a fourth floor conference center facility were completed in 1987. In 1979, the Library was named for Golda Meir, the fourth Prime Minister of Israel, who attended Milwaukee State Normal School, a UWM predecessor institution.

The south end of the Central Quad is anchored by the UWM Student Union, the center of student and campus life for UWM. At , the Student Union is one of the largest student centers in the nation, and its 26,000 plus visitors a day during the spring and fall academic terms makes the Union one of the busiest buildings in Wisconsin on a daily basis. Golda Meir Library on the north and the Student Union on the south are connected by the Ernest Spaights Plaza, the central commons for UWM and the roof level of the 480 vehicle Union parking structure. Overtowering the Ernest Spaights Plaza to the west is Bolton Hall which houses the Departments of Sociology, Anthropology, Political Science, Economics, Urban Studies, and Geography, as well as many student support centers including the Student Success Center and the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR).

West of Bolton Hall is Lubar Hall, home of Sheldon B. Lubar School of Business. This four-story facility consists of of classroom, computer labs and office space and can accommodate 2,000 students in its instructional facilities at one time. Originally constructed in 1995 as the Business Administration Building, it was renamed in 2006, Lubar Hall in honor of Sheldon B. Lubar, a prominent Milwaukee businessman, civic leader and philanthropist. Lubar is founder and chairman of Lubar &amp; Company, Inc., a private investment firm. His commitment to UWM and higher education spans more than three decades including service as a past president of the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents. Lubar&#x27;s distinguished career of public service also includes his work as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration. The building&#x27;s original automated light and temperature controls featured a system called The Lighting Showcase by the Wisconsin Electric Power Company. It was designed to provide maximum energy efficiency for the most highly utilized academic building on the UWM campus. In addition to providing nearly 200 offices, there are three lecture halls, with a total of 785 seats; seven arc-shaped classrooms; ten U-shaped classrooms; an Executive MBA classroom; three computer labs; and two levels of underground parking. In 2023, Jeff Yabuki was named the Sheldon B. Lubar executive-in-residence.

On the east side of the Ernest Spaights Plaza are the Art building, Music building, and the Theatre building which are all indirectly connected through a series of basement hallways, and on the second floor. These buildings make up what is part of the Peck School of the Arts. Main buildings on the east side of the central quad include Mitchell Hall, sometimes known as &quot;Old Main,&quot; which was the home of the original Milwaukee State Teachers College; Garland and Pearse Halls (which formerly housed Milwaukee-Downer Seminary); Curtin Hall; etc.

===North Quad===
The north side of the North Quad contains the Downer Woods, a wooded area and conservation center. On the west side of North Quad are the Sandburg Residence Halls, a complex comprising four high-rise dormitories. Sandburg Residence Hall houses about 2,700 students.

In the central part of North Quad, there are the school&#x27;s indoor sports facilities the Klotsche Center and its new addition the Pavilion. Next to the indoor sports facilities is Chapman Hall and the 11-story Enderis Hall, which houses the College of Health Sciences, School of Education, and the Helen Bader School of Social Welfare.

The east side of the North Quad is a group of old red buildings, including Holton Hall, Merrill Hall, Johnston Hall, Sabin Hall, and others. These older buildings were acquired by the university in the Milwaukee-Downer College campus purchase. The Milwaukee-Downer &quot;Quad&quot; (Holton, Johnston, Merrill and Greene Halls) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

===West Quad===
The West Quad is the location for the College of Engineering and Applied Science, the College of Nursing, the School of Architecture and Urban Planning, and the natural science departments. The College of Engineering and Applied Science is housed in the EMS building. The Physics Building is to the south, and the Chemistry Building and Lapham Hall (housing the Biology and Geosciences Departments, as well as the Thomas A. Greene Memorial Museum) are to the east. Cunningham Hall on the northwest side houses the College of Nursing.

The award-winning Architecture and Urban Planning Building on the east side of the West Quad was completed in 1993. With more than , it is one of the largest school of architecture buildings built in the U.S. in the last forty years. The exterior of the L-shaped building has brick walls accented by metal panels and large windows. Full glass walls facing onto the central courtyard afford a view of that area from almost every room in the building. Inside, the air ducts, light fixtures and structural system have been left exposed, providing a unique architectural teaching environment. The building includes student design studios, classrooms, a lecture hall, exhibition areas, computer labs, offices, a media and photography center, and research centers.

In October 2015, the university unveiled the Kenwood Interdisciplinary Research Complex, a distinctive 141,000 square-foot building at a cost of $80 million.

In May 2019, UWM opened the UWM Lubar Entrepreneurship Center and UWM Welcome Center in a new $8.3 million building, sitting just south of the Kenwood Interdisciplinary Research Complex.

Surrounded by the buildings in the West Quad is Engelmann Stadium, home to the Milwaukee Panthers men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams. Built in 1973, the 2,000-capacity stadium is tucked between buildings in the middle of the West Quad, making it a unique stadium among American sports venues. Engelmann Stadium is home to the longest-running in-season tournament in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s soccer, the Panther Invitational. UWM has hosted the event annually since the program&#x27;s inception in 1973, save for the 1990 season. The tournament entered its 38th year in 2012.

===Northwest Quad===
The former Columbia-St.Mary&#x27;s hospital was acquired in 2010. It contains a seven-building complex, with over and a parking structure, expanding the campus by 20 percent. Currently, the building houses the School of Information Studies, UWM&#x27;s child care center, the Biological Sciences Greenhouse, and numerous departments&#x27; offices. The uses of the remaining portions of the complex are yet to be determined, although the university said in 2020 that it would raze Building A, the former Columbia Hospital building. The demolition began in spring 2022 after the covid-19 pandemic delayed the project. The former east wing is currently called Building A, west wing as Building B, Clinical Building as Building C, and the Medical Arts Building as Building D.

==Academics==

The university consists of 15 colleges and schools, 70 academic centers, institutes and laboratory facilities and offers a total of 191 degree programs, including 94 bachelor&#x27;s, 64 master&#x27;s and 33 doctorate degrees. The School of Freshwater Sciences is the only graduate school of freshwater science in the U.S. and the third in the world. The Joseph J. Zilber School of Public Health is the first CEPH accredited dedicated school of public health in Wisconsin. The School of Architecture and Urban Planning, the College of Nursing and the College of Health Sciences are the largest in Wisconsin.

===Libraries===
Golda Meir Library is the university&#x27;s main library. The 379,000 square foot library has more than 5.2 million cataloged items, many of which are available electronically through electronic reserve, web-based online catalog, searchable databases and indexes. The building was first constructed in 1967 and then expanded with the addition of the East Wing in 1974 and conference center in 1982. In 2007, Golda Meir Library Renovation Project was launched, which contributed to create the Daniel M. Soref Learning Commons, completed in 2009. This place, located on the first floor of West Wing, provides students learning spaces to study and work together. The library is named for Golda Meir, the fourth Prime Minister of Israel, who graduated in 1917 from the Milwaukee State Normal School, a predecessor institution of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The Golda Meir Library is also home to the American Geographical Society Library (AGSL), which &quot;consists of nearly 2 million items including maps, atlases, globes, photographs, monographs, serials and digital geospatial data&quot; according to the UWM Libraries website.

==Student life==

===Housing===
There are five university-managed student housing facilities: Cambridge Commons, Kenilworth Square Apartments, RiverView Residence Hall, and Sandburg Halls.

Sandburg Halls is the largest student residence hall on campus. It is a four-tower complex with a capacity of 2,700 students, arranged in three- and four-room suites. The North, South, and West towers were built in 1970, with the East tower opening in 2000. All East tower suites have full-size kitchens and a dining area. Sandburg Hall went through a renovation in the summer of 2008 with the installation of an environmentally friendly roof. Following a design by associate professor Jim Walsey, this change was intended to prevent overflows and backups into neighboring homes. Facilities inside the building include a cafeteria, fitness center, convenience store, coffee shop, computer lab and a second-run movie theater for residents. Sandburg Halls also has space for recreational activities, including grass space, a patio, tennis courts, basketball courts, and sand volleyball.

Kenilworth Square is located a mile south of the main campus and has a capacity of about 330 upper-class, graduate, and older students in one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments in a converted Ford factory that also houses classrooms, galleries, and studios of the Peck School of the Arts.

RiverView Residence Hall, opened to first year students in 2008, is located several blocks west of Kenilworth Square and has a capacity of 470 students. There are a 24-hour University Housing shuttle, MCTS, and BOSS (Be On the Safe Side, the university shuttle service) running between the residence hall and the main campus. First year students can also attend some classes within the residence hall.

Cambridge Commons is the newest residence hall project, which opened in 2010 and houses 700 residents. Approximately 140 spaces are available for returning residents in apartment-style suites to include living rooms and kitchens. The remaining spaces are two-room suites with a shared bathroom and refrigerator. The lobby features a fireplace lounge, music practice rooms equipped with recording technology, and a computer lab. Cambridge is a LEED Gold certified building, with two green roofs, solar panels, and a green courtyard that reduces rain runoff using a 20,000 gallon holding tank.

All of housing with the exception of Kenilworth Square students are serviced by the Student Housing Administrative Council (SHAC) which is Milwaukee&#x27;s version of a RHA and is student run.

In addition to these university-managed residence halls, students also occupy apartments and rental houses in the surrounding neighborhood. The Neighborhood Housing Office is available to help students seeking off-campus housing.

===Media===
The &quot;UWM Post&quot; is an online newspaper independently run by the students. Journalism students used to run &quot;Frontpage Milwaukee&quot;, another online newspaper. The UWM Journalism, Advertising and Media Studies department also publishes student work on Media Milwaukee, an online news publication.

Journalism &amp; Mass Communication students used to run PantherVision, a weekly, news program distributed via the Higher Education Cable Consortium to approximately 300,000 households in southeastern Wisconsin.

The College of Letters and Science runs WUWM, a Milwaukee public radio station serving southeastern Wisconsin with news, public affairs and entertainment programming.

PantherU.com is a non-affiliated sports news media website that covers Milwaukee Panthers athletics in specific.

In October 2022, a student-run internet radio station was started on campus called Prowl Radio.

===Student organizations===

There are over 300 student organizations on campus. The governing body is the Student Association of UWM, which under Wisconsin&#x27;s &quot;shared governance&quot; system (statute 36.09(5)) interacts with the university administration and the student body to insure students rights and interests. Other student organizations in the university vary greatly in nature, ranging from political (College Democrats, College Republicans), academic, cultural, to sports clubs.

UWM is home to a number of Greek organizations, including 6 IFC Council Fraternities and 3 Panhellenic Council Sororities, along with 7 Multicultural Greek Council and 6 NPHC organizations. The number of fraternity and sorority houses remains extremely limited due to Milwaukee&#x27;s housing ordinance that restricts occupancy to no more than three unrelated individuals.

===Pantherfest===

At the beginning or end of each academic year, the university stages Pantherfest at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater area on the south end of Milwaukee&#x27;s lakefront Summerfest Grounds. It is the largest and culminating event of the university&#x27;s two-week Fall Welcome festivities; celebrating the start of the academic year with various campus events and activities.

This service is funded through students segregated fees.

==Athletics==
UWM has had three mascots and nicknames: Green Gulls (1910–1956), Cardinals (1956–1964) and Panthers (1964–present).

A total of 15 Panthers athletic teams compete at the NCAA level for Milwaukee in the ten-member Horizon League, which it joined for the 1994 season. Prior to moving to the Division I level for all NCAA sports in the 1990–91 season, the Panthers competed in Division I, Division II, Division III and the NAIA.

===Men&#x27;s Basketball===

Under the tutelage of Bruce Pearl, the Panthers won their first ever Horizon League Tournament in 2003, leading to their first appearance in the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship. They would return to the tournament in 2005 where they gained national attention when they defeated Boston College for a trip to the Sweet Sixteen. The Panthers pulled off one more upset in the 2006 NCAA Tournament over Oklahoma under new head coach Rob Jeter.

===Football===

Milwaukee disbanded its football program after the 1974 season, its 75th at the varsity level. Although it was considered a small program throughout its existence, it produced six players who went on to play in the National Football League including Houston Oilers All-Pro safety Mike Reinfeldt. Other notable Milwaukee football alums include Bill Carollo, the Panthers&#x27; starting quarterback from 1970 to 1973; and University of Illinois head coach Robert Zuppke.

In 2011, then-athletic director Rick Costello hired a consulting firm to look into the feasibility of reinstating football at the university.

Since 2003, Milwaukee has had a successful club football program. From 2003 to 2010, they competed against the club football team from Marquette University in an annual tilt known as the Brew City Classic. The Panthers held on to the Golden Keg (the games&#x27; trophy) for the duration of the series until Marquette disbanded its program in 2011. In 2012, they finished the season ranked No. 7 nationally by the Intercollegiate Club Football Federation.

<text>The Appomattox Court House National Historical Park is the preserved 19th-century village named Appomattox Court House in Appomattox County, Virginia. The village was named for the presence nearby of what is now preserved as the Old Appomattox Court House. The village is the site of the Battle of Appomattox Court House, and contains the McLean House, where the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee to Union commander Ulysses S. Grant took place on April 9, 1865, an event widely symbolic of the end of the American Civil War. The village itself began as the community of Clover Hill, which was made the county seat of Appomattox County in the 1840s. The village of Appomattox Court House entered a stage of decline after it was bypassed by a railroad in 1854. In 1930, the United States War Department was authorized to erect a monument at the site, and in 1933 the War Department&#x27;s holdings there was transferred to the National Park Service. The site was greatly enlarged in 1935, and a restoration of the McLean House was planned but was delayed by World War II. In 1949, the restored McLean House was reopened to the public. Several restored buildings (including the McLean House and the courthouse), as well as a number of original 19th-century structures are situated at the site.

== Antebellum history ==

The antebellum village started out as &quot;Clover Hill&quot;. The village was a stop along the Richmond–Lynchburg stagecoach road. It was also the site of organizational meetings, so when Appomattox County was established by an Act on February 8, 1845, Clover Hill village became the county seat. Appomattox County was formed from parts of Buckingham, Prince Edward, Charlotte, and Campbell counties. The jurisdiction took its name from the headwaters that emanate there, the Appomattox River; the name Appomattox was believed to originate with the Apumetec tribe of Native Americans.

From about 1842, Hugh Raine owned most of the Clover Hill area. He obtained it from his brother John Raine who defaulted on his loans. Following the establishment of Appomattox County, it became the county seat and of the hamlet were divided into town lots. The state designated to be taken as a location for county government buildings. The courthouse was to be built across the Stage Road from the Clover Hill Tavern&#x27;s stable, with the jail behind the courthouse. In late 1845, Hugh Raine and another of his brothers sold the Clover Hill area to Samuel D. McDearmon. McDearmon attempted to sell the lots in Clover Hill, but with little success. While the village did grow, in 1854, the decision to route a railroad through nearby Appomattox Depot led to many businesses leaving Appomattox Court House for the Appomattox Depot area. Around the same time, the stage route into Appomattox Court House was discontinued, and the village entered a decline.

== Civil War and further decline ==
In early April 1865, during the end of the American Civil War, Confederate States Army forces commanded by General Robert E. Lee were being pursued by Union Army troops commanded by Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. Trapped at Appomattox Court House, Lee&#x27;s troops attacked on April 9 in the Battle of Appomattox Court House, but were unsuccessful. That day, Lee met with Grant to discuss terms of surrender at the McLean House. After discussion, Lee signed surrender terms that day, and on April 12, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia laid down its arms and marched away. While the war continued after the surrender of Lee&#x27;s army, the surrender at Appomattox Court House has become widely symbolic of the defeat of the Confederacy. The war&#x27;s end did not stop the decline of the village, and when the county&#x27;s records were destroyed in an 1892 courthouse fire, it was decided to move the county seat to the railroad community at Appomattox Depot, which became the town of Appomattox.

== Park development history ==
In 1892, after the courthouse had burned and the McLean House had been dismantled, George B. Davis learned of the deteriorating state of the village and received permission to have metal tablets placed at the locations of important historic sites at the village. In 1930, the United States Congress passed legislation to have the United States War Department acquire a site at the village for a monument relating to the 1865 surrender, and three years later, the War Department&#x27;s holdings at Appomattox Court House were transferred to the National Park Service. The site&#x27;s name was changed from the &quot;Appomattox Battlefield Site&quot; to &quot;Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument&quot; in 1935 as part of legislation that authorized the park to be increased in size and for the McLean House to be reconstructed; the name change to &quot;Appomattox Court House National Historical Park&quot; occurred in 1954. In 1940, the park was increased to , and a plan to rebuild both the courthouse and the McLean House was formalized. World War II delayed reconstruction at the site, but in 1949, the restored McLean House was opened to the public. On October 15, 1966, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The village itself has since been restored by the National Park Service, with a number of original 19th-century structures remaining, including the Clover Hill Tavern.

Besides the surviving original structures, the roughly park contains reconstructed historic buildings as well, including the McLean House. Both a driving tour path and hiking trails are present in the park. Points of interest along the trails include interpretive signage, the location of Lee&#x27;s headquarters, and an artillery park including cannons. The park&#x27;s visitor center is located in the rebuilt courthouse.

<doc id="512200" wikidata="Q2894583" url="?curid=512200" title="Bell CH-146 Griffon">
<text>The Bell CH-146 Griffon is a multi-role utility helicopter designed by Bell Helicopter Textron as a variant of the Bell 412EP for the Canadian Armed Forces. It is used in a wide variety of roles, including aerial firepower, reconnaissance, search and rescue and aero-mobility tasks. The CH-146 has a crew of three, can carry up to ten troops and has a cruising speed of .

The CH-146 is a continuation of decades long use of the Huey family by Canadian military, starting with the UH-1H model in 1968, and expanded by use of the UH-1N Twin Huey; known as the CH-118 and CH-135 respectively. Both were retired in the 1990s and replaced by the CH-146; it also replaced early model CH-147 Chinook and CH-136 Kiowa helicopters, although in the 2010s additional Chinooks were acquired of the latest type. The CH-146 has served in missions internationally and domestically. They were built in Canada. The fleet is currently being modernized for service into the 2030s.

==Design and development==

The CH-146 is the Canadian military designation for the Bell 412CF, a modified Bell 412, ordered by Canada in 1992. The CH-146 was built at Mirabel, Quebec, at the Bell Canadian plant. It was delivered between 1995 and 1997 in one of two configurations, the Combat Support Squadron (CSS) version for search and rescue missions, and the Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter (UTTH), which carries a crew of three and an eight-man section.

The Bell 412 family is popular with military operators globally, and was also produced under license in Italy by Augusta;the 412 and its variants was further modernization of the Bell 212.
The Griffon can be equipped with various specialized bolt-on mission kits which can enhance its performance, from increasing range to improving protection against enemy fire, etc.

While the CH-146 can be equipped with a total of 13 seats in the cargo area in addition to the two in front for the aircrew, weight restrictions usually result in a normal combat load of eight equipped troops or fewer depending on armament and fuel carried. The aircraft can also be configured for up to six stretchers.

Minor disassembly permits transport of the Griffon by CC-130 Hercules or CC-177 Globemaster III aircraft for long-distance deployment.

===Maintenance and upgrades===
The CH-146 was forecast to be retired as early as 2021, but with an option to extend. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Inc. was awarded a C$640 million contract to overhaul and repair the CH-146 fleet until retirement in 2021. The contract includes options to extend the contract up to 2025 if necessary.

In January 2019, Canada announced plans to modernize and extend the life of the existing 85 CH-146s to 2031. In May 2022, the contract was signed. The contract with Bell Canada will allow the type to be in service until the 2030s. The maintenance work is done in Canada and sustains over 1100 jobs there.

In April 2024, the Government of Canada announced plans to spend C$18.4 billion over 20 years to acquire additional helicopters that are more &quot;modern, mobile, and effective&quot; to increase the speed and airlift capacity in responding to natural disasters, emergencies, and assertions of sovereignty. It is not clear if implication is to supplement or replace the CH-146 fleet. The CH-146 is one of several assets in Canada&#x27;s vertical lift portfolio which, by the 2020s, includes the CH-149 Cormorant (Medium-lift Search and Rescue (EH101)), CH-147 Chinook (twin-rotor heavy-lift), CH-148 Cyclone (maritime medium lift transport and ASW (S-92)), among others.

In 2024, the Canadian Government announced a service contract to sustain the CH-146 Griffon fleet.

==Operational history==



The Canadian Forces purchased 100 aircraft and received them in 1995–1997. In 2005, nine CH-146s were sold to the Allied Wings consortium to be used as trainers at 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School. By the 2020s, over 80 were still in service in 11 squadrons, and Canada planned to operate them into the 2030s.

Some of the task the helicopters are used for are training, utility, tactical transport, search and rescue, armed escort for Chinooks.

===Canada===
The CH-146 Griffon have been deployed in various operations in Canada since their introduction in 1995. They have been deployed during the Operation Saguenay in 1996 and Operation Assistance in 1997. The CH-146 have also played a major role during the great ice storm of 1998. They were deployed during the 28th G8 summit and 36th G8 summit. They were also deployed to secure the 2010 Winter Olympics during the Operation Podium. In May 2016, four Griffons were deployed as part of Operation LENTUS 16-01, to provide emergency services for victims of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire.

===Haiti and Balkans===
CH-146s have been deployed in Haiti. They were deployed during Operation Standard and Operation Constable between 1996 and 1997. They were deployed more recently during Operation Halo in 2004 and Operation Hestia in 2010.

Griffons have been deployed in Bosnia and Kosovo during Operation Kinetic between 1999 and 2000 and Operation Paladium between 1998 and 2004.

===Afghanistan===

In 2007, the Canadian American Strategic Review suggested that the Canadian Forces consider deploying Griffons to Afghanistan, because they were comparable to the UH-1 Hueys deployed by the United States Marine Corps. The USMC used both the Bell UH-1N Twin Huey (also used by Canada) and the newer Bell UH-1Y Venom.

On 26 November 2008, the Canadian Forces announced in a statement that eight Griffons would be modified to act as armed escorts for CH-147 Chinook helicopters in Afghanistan. Equipped with a M134D Minigun, the helicopters were employed in a defensive and support role, including the evacuation of battlefield casualties. The eight CH-146s arrived at Kandahar International Airport on 20 December 2008.

===Suitability for role===
The CH-146 was purchased by the CF to replace four existing helicopters, the CH-136 Kiowa in the observation role, the CH-135 Twin Huey in the army tactical role, the CH-118 Iroquois in the base rescue role and the heavy lift CH-147 Chinook. From the time of its purchase defence analysts have been critical of the aircraft pointing to its procurement as politically motivated and that the aircraft cannot adequately fill any of its intended roles. It has been termed &quot;a civilian designed and built aircraft, with only a coat of green paint.&quot;

Writing in 2006 defence analyst Sharon Hobson said:
The CH-146 was ruled out for the Afghan mission by General Rick Hillier when he was Chief of Defence Staff in 2008 due to being underpowered. It has also been criticised for being underpowered by Martin Shadwick, a defence analyst and professor at York University. Shadwick stated in July 2009:

At the inquest into the death of Capt Ben Babington-Browne (killed on 6 July 2009 in the crash of aircraft #146434), Lt Cdr William Robley of the UK Defence Helicopter Flying School confirmed that operating the aircraft at that altitude, temperature and weight meant that it was not the correct helicopter for that mission. When asked by the coroner: &quot;Had you been there, would it have been obvious to you of the risks attached to using the Griffon helicopter in these conditions?&quot; Lt Cdr Robley replied: &quot;Yes.&quot; When asked: &quot;Would you expect a competent pilot to have understood that this was not the correct helicopter for the mission?&quot;, Lt Cdr Robley replied: &quot;It depended on the pilot&#x27;s training; unless they have been trained, they are on a voyage of discovery.&quot;

Retired Lieutenant General Lou Cuppens defended the aircraft&#x27;s performance:
Defence Minister Peter MacKay also defended the aircraft:
=== Latvia ===
Starting in 2025, Canada is planning to send 4 Griffon&#x27;s to Latvia, as part of a NATO mission there, specifically Operation REASSURANCE.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 July 2002, #146420 operated by 444 Sqn crashed north of CFB Goose Bay while returning from a search and rescue mission that had been called off. Both pilots were killed on impact and the SAR Technician and Flight Engineer were both seriously injured. The cause of the crash was the loss of the aircraft tail rotor after a tail rotor blade failed from fatigue.
*On 6 July 2009, #146434 crashed about northeast of Kandahar city in Afghanistan, killing two Canadian soldiers, along with a captain from the British Royal Engineers. Three other Canadians were hurt. The crash was reportedly an accident due to the pilot&#x27;s loss of visual reference in recirculating dust and not due to enemy action, but an inquest into the death of Capt Ben Babington-Browne was told that the helicopter was unsuitable for hot and high operations in Afghanistan. In April 2016, it was revealed that a military police investigation of senior air force officers was underway for negligence for not providing adequate training for aircrew in dealing with takeoffs in dusty conditions and also for raising the operational gross weight of the aircraft above that safe for operation.

<doc id="512217" wikidata="Q1426529" url="?curid=512217" title="Bisexual flag">
<text>The bisexual flag, also called the bisexual pride flag, is a pride flag representing bisexuality, bisexual individuals and the bisexual community. According to Michael Page, the activist who created the flag based on a color palette designed by Liz Nania, the pink stripe represents attraction to the same sex, while the blue stripe represents attraction to the opposite sex. The purple stripe, the resulting &quot;overlap&quot; of the blue and pink stripes, represents attraction to both sexes.

Page designed the flag to increase the visibility of bisexuals among society as a whole and within the LGBT community. He aimed to give the bisexual community a symbol that is comparable to the rainbow flag for the greater LGBT community. The first bisexual pride flag was unveiled at the BiCafe&#x27;s first anniversary party on December 5, 1998.

==Design and colors==
Page stated that he took the colors and overlap for the flag from the biangles, symbol of bisexuality. The biangles symbol of bisexuality was designed by artist Liz Nania as she co-organized a bisexual contingent for the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987. The design of the biangles began with the pink triangle, a Nazi concentration camp badge that later became a symbol of gay liberation representing homosexuality. The addition of a blue triangle contrasts the pink and represents heterosexuality. The two triangles overlap and form lavender, which represents the &quot;queerness of bisexuality&quot;, referencing the Lavender Menace and 1980s and 1990s associations of lavender with queerness.

Page described the meaning of the pink, purple, and blue colors:
 
Since the original design, the purple overlap has been reinterpreted and is now widely understood to represent attraction regardless of sex or gender.

The flag is used in different aspect ratios; 2:3 and 3:5 are often used, in common with many other flags.

In vexillological terms, the bisexual pride flag is a simple horizontal tricolor.

The exact colors given by Page are PMS 226 for the pink, 258 for the purple, and 286 for the blue: 
:

The pink stripe takes up two fifths of the flag, the purple stripe takes up the middle fifth, and the blue stripe takes up the other two fifths. The flag has been most commonly oriented with the pink stripe at the top, but both orientations are acceptable. The flag is not patented, trademarked, or service marked.

In 1999, Michael Page established the use of the trillium flower as a symbol of bisexuality, and in 2001, Francisco Javier Lagunes Gaitán and Miguel Angel Corona designed a Mexican variant of the bisexual pride flag, which is emblazoned with an emblem of a trillium flower.

==Licensing controversy==

In 1998, Page stated that the bisexual pride flag was &quot;for free public and commercial use&quot; and that it was &quot;not patented, trademarked or service marked&quot;. In April 2020, BiNet USA falsely claimed that it was the sole copyright owner of the flag and flag colors, and said organizations and individuals who wished to use the flag for commercial purposes would be required to obtain a license from the organization, despite having nothing to do with the flag&#x27;s design or creation. BiNet&#x27;s claim and the resulting controversy were covered by &quot;Out&quot; and &quot;LGBTQ Nation&quot;, which cast doubt on BiNet&#x27;s claim and noted that the flag is not eligible for copyright.

BiNet USA ultimately ceased to use the flag on May 8, 2020, opting instead to use a different design.

==Other symbols representing bisexuality==

=== Double Moon ===

Because many bisexuals objected to the use of a symbol based on the pink triangle, Vivian Wagner designed the double moon as an alternative way to symbolize bisexuality.

<doc id="512222" wikidata="Q615997" url="?curid=512222" title="Bill Emmott">
<text>William John Emmott (born 6 August 1956) is an English journalist, author, and consultant best known as the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Economist&quot; newspaper from 1993 to 2006. Emmott has written fourteen books and worked on two documentary feature films. He is now chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the Japan Society of the UK in London, and of the International Trade Institute, an Irish educational body. He is also Senior Adviser, Geopolitics, for Montrose Associates, a strategic intelligence consultancy, a trustee of the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, and an Ushioda Fellow at Tokyo College, University of Tokyo.

==Life and work==
Emmott was born on 6 August 1956 to Richard Anthony and Audrey Mary Emmott. His father was an accountant. Emmott was educated at Latymer Upper School in London and Magdalen College, Oxford. He graduated from Oxford with first-class honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. Emmott first married Charlotte Crowther in 1982. After they divorced he married Carol Barbara Mawer in 1992. After graduation and after an uncompleted D-Phil on French politics at Nuffield College, Oxford, he worked for &quot;The Economist&quot; newspaper in Brussels, Tokyo, and London, and became the fifteenth editor of the publication in March 1993. Emmott resigned thirteen years later on 20 February 2006. During his tenure, &quot;The Economist&quot; editorialised in favour of the Iraq War, of legalising gay marriage, of abolishing the British monarchy, and of opposing Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister of Italy. In 2009, Emmott received the Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award for excellence in business journalism.

Emmott served as chairman of the London Library from 2009 to 2015. He worked as a group economic adviser for Fleming Family &amp; Partners from 2011 to 2015. He is currently an Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo&#x27;s Tokyo College and is a member of UTokyo&#x27;s Global Advisory Board. He has been a visiting professor at Shujitsu University in Okayama, Japan, a visiting fellow at the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford, and a visiting fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. From 2006 to 2019 Emmott was also an adviser to Swiss Re and served as the chairman of the content board at Ofcom from January to July 2016 when the organisation&#x27;s executive decided that the Brexit referendum result made it too uncomfortable to have a working journalist in that role.

Emmott wrote the best-selling book &quot;The Sun Also Sets: The Limits to Japan&#x27;s Economic Power&quot; (1989), as well as &quot;20:21 Vision: Twentieth-Century Lessons for the Twenty-First Century&quot; (2003), &quot;Japanophobia: The Myth of the Invincible Japanese&quot; (1993), and &quot;Rivals: How the Power Struggle Between China, India and Japan Will Shape our Next Decade&quot; (2008).

His book about Italy, (Come on Italy: How to Restart after Berlusconi) was translated to Italian and published in 2010. Initially there was no English language version of this book. Emmott then updated, revised, and expanded the content for an English language version called &quot;Good Italy, Bad Italy&quot;, which was published in 2012.

In April 2016, the government of Japan awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon.

Emmott writes columns on current affairs for &quot;La Stampa&quot; in Italy, for Nikkei Business and the Mainichi Shimbun in Japan, and for Project Syndicate worldwide. His book &quot;The Fate of the West: The Battle to Save the World&#x27;s Most Successful Political Idea&quot;, was published in April 2017. Next, &quot;Japan&#x27;s Far More Female Future&quot; was published in Japanese by Nikkei in July 2019 and in English by Oxford University Press in 2020. His latest book is &quot;Deterrence, Diplomacy and the Risk of Conflict over Taiwan&quot;, published by IISS/Routledge in its Adelphi series in July 2024; a Japanese translation has been published by Fusosha in the same month, under the title &quot;How To Stop World War Three&quot;.

He currently lives with his wife Carol in Oxford and Dublin with their 2 dogs.

==Film work==
=== &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; ===
Emmott co-wrote and narrated a documentary film entitled &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot;, which depicts Italy in a 20-year-long crisis. It was made in 2012 by Springshot Productions under the direction and co-authorship of Annalisa Piras. It was broadcast on BBC Four, Sky Italia and La7 TV channels early in 2013, and subsequently on other channels worldwide, as well as more than 46 independently organised public screenings in Italy and abroad. During the six months following its release, the film was watched by more than one and a half million viewers.

=== &quot;The Great European Disaster Movie&quot; ===
Emmott and Piras again worked together on &quot;The Great European Disaster Movie&quot; which was aired in Britain, France, Germany and many other European countries in early 2015. The movie has been seen by 2,500,000 people in twelve countries and been translated into ten languages. In October 2015, Emmott and Piras made the film freely available for public screenings and debates about the future of the European Union. In May 2016, it was awarded the German CIVIS Media Prize in the category TV-Information.

==Wake Up Foundation==
Emmott and Piras set up the Wake Up Foundation to use film, text, and data for public education about the decline of Western countries. The first projects of the foundation were the Wake Up Europe! initiative, &quot;The Great European Disaster Movie&quot;, and a statistical indicator of the long-term health of western societies called 2050 Index. In May 2019, the foundation held its inaugural Wake Up Europe Film Festival for social impact documentaries in Turin.

<text>Pinus pumila, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf pine, dwarf Siberian pine, dwarf stone pine, Japanese stone pine, or creeping pine, is a tree in the family Pinaceae native to northeastern Asia and the Japanese isles. It shares the common name &quot;creeping pine&quot; with several other plants.

==Description==

The Siberian dwarf pine is a coniferous evergreen shrub ranging from in height, exceptionally up to , but may have individual branches that extend further along the ground in length. In the mountains of northern Japan, it sometimes hybridizes with the related Japanese white pine (&quot;Pinus parviflora&quot;); these hybrids (&quot;Pinus&quot; × &quot;hakkodensis&quot;) are larger than &quot;P. pumila&quot;, reaching tall on occasion.
The leaves are needle-like, formed in bundles of five and are 4–6 centimeters long. The cones are 2.5–4.5cm long, with large nut-like seeds (pine nuts).

==Distribution==
The range covers the Far East, Eastern Siberia, north-east of Mongolia, north-east of China, northern Japan and Korea. Siberian dwarf pine can be found along mountain chains, above the tree line, where it forms dense, uninterrupted thickets; it also grows on the headlands above the Okhotsk and Bering Seas, Tatarsk and Pacific coast (the Kurils).

&quot;P. pumila&quot; grows very slowly. It can live up to 300 and, in some instances, 1,000 years. In the colder conditions of Siberia, there are specimens which are 250 years old and older.

== Ecology ==
The seeds are harvested and dispersed by the spotted nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga caryocatactes&quot;).

&quot;P. pumila&quot; has highly flammable needles, branches, and cones and readily carries crown fires, especially where it grows continuously across local landscapes. It has serotinous cones that release seeds following fire facilitating its recovery following severe fires caused by lightning strikes and other causes.

== Cultivation ==
This plant is grown as an ornamental shrub in parks and gardens. The cultivar &quot;P. pumila&quot; &#x27;Glauca&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Etihad Airways is the national airline of the United Arab Emirates. Its head office is in Khalifa City, Abu Dhabi, near Zayed International Airport. The airline commenced operations in November 2003, and is the second-largest airline in the UAE after Emirates.

The airline operates more than 1,000 flights per week to over 120 passenger and cargo destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America, with a fleet of 97 Airbus and Boeing aircraft Its main base is at Zayed International Airport. In addition to its main activity of passenger transportation, Etihad also operates Etihad Holidays and Etihad Cargo.

==History==
=== Background ===
The Emirate of Abu Dhabi was a joint-owner of Gulf Air along with Bahrain, Qatar, and the Sultanate of Oman. Zayed International Airport was one of Gulf Air&#x27;s bases and hubs from the 1970s until 2005, when the UAE withdrew from the airline. Gulf Air would remain as a two-state carrier until Oman&#x27;s exit in 2007 to focus on Oman Air and today, Gulf Air is solely owned by Bahrain.
=== Name===
&quot;Etihad&quot; means &quot;union&quot; or &quot;unity&quot; in Arabic, and represents the unity of the seven Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah).

=== Foundation ===
In July 2003, future UAE president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who wanted an airline for Abu Dhabi, issued an Amiri decree that established Etihad Airways as a national airline of the United Arab Emirates. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saif Al Nahyan founded the airline and utilized AED500 million of start-up capital. Services were launched with a ceremonial flight to Al Ain on 5 November 2003. On 12 November 2003, Etihad commenced commercial operations by launching services to Beirut, Lebanon.

In June 2004, the airline placed a US$8 billion aircraft order for six Boeing 777-200 and 24 Airbus aircraft, including 10 Airbus A380s. Etihad&#x27;s first A380 was delivered in December 2014.

In June 2008, at the Farnborough Airshow, the airline announced an order for 35 Boeing 787s and 10 777s, options for 25 787s and 10 777s, and purchase rights for 10 787s and 5 777s. Etihad reported its first full-year net profit in 2011, of US$14 million, in line with the strategic plan announced by CEO James Hogan in 2006.

===Equity Alliance===
In December 2011, Etihad announced it had acquired a 29.21% stake in Air Berlin, Europe&#x27;s sixth-largest airline, and Hogan was appointed Vice Chairman. It followed this up with minority stakes in other airlines—Air Seychelles (40%), Aer Lingus (2.987%), Virgin Australia (10%).

On 1 August 2013, the president of the company, Hogan, signed a deal with Aleksandar Vučić, the First Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, in Belgrade, granting Etihad a 49% stake in the Serbian national carrier Jat Airways. The Serbian government retained 51% of the shares, with the company was rebranded as Air Serbia. In September 2012, the Indian government announced that foreign airlines could hold up to 49% stake in Indian carriers. On 24 April 2013, Jet Airways announced it was ready to sell a 24% stake to Etihad for US$379 million. The deal was completed on 12 November 2013.

At the 2013 Dubai Airshow, Etihad announced it was acquiring a 33.3% stake in the Swiss carrier Darwin Airline, which was rebranded as Etihad Regional in March 2014. Etihad sold its stake in Darwin in 2017.

On 1 August 2014, Etihad agreed to acquire a 49% stake in the Italian flag carrier Alitalia for an estimated €560 million. The deal was finalized on 8 August 2014. On 1 January 2015, Alitalia-CAI formally transferred its operations to Alitalia-SAI, a new entity owned 49% by Etihad and 51% by the Alitalia-CAI shareholders.

The airline established its airline alliance, Etihad Airways Partners, in October 2015. It ceased operations in 2018 after several of its members fell into financial difficulties. Etihad held minority investments in the participating airlines and previously had a stake in Virgin Australia until its insolvency in April 2020 with no return on investment. In May 2016, the management structure was reshuffled, as Hogan became CEO of the airline&#x27;s parent company, Etihad Aviation Group. Peter Baumgartner, formerly the airline&#x27;s Chief Commercial Officer, became chief executive officer of the airline, reporting to Hogan. In December 2016 &quot;Handelsblatt Global&quot; reported that Hogan was expected to be dismissed after a &quot;failed spree of acquisitions in Europe.&quot;

On 24 January 2017, the Etihad Aviation Group Board of Directors announced that Hogan (along with Group CFO James Rigney) would be stepping down &quot;in the second half of 2017&quot;. Peter Baumgartner, (former CEO of the airline), became the acting CEO as it faced mounting losses from its investments in Air Berlin and Alitalia. On 2 May 2017, Alitalia filed for bankruptcy. Hogan and Rigney left Etihad later that month. On 27 July, Etihad reported a loss of US$1.873 billion for 2016. On 15 August, Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy after Etihad withdrew its financial support.

As an interim measure, the board appointed Ray Gammell as CEO (previously Chief People and Performance Officer) while searching for a permanent replacement. On 9 January 2018, Etihad Airways appointed Mark Powers as Group CFO, replacing interim Group CFO Ricky Thirion. On 2 July 2017, the United States Department of Homeland Security lifted the electronics ban on Etihad Airways after the airline enhanced its passenger screening processes.

In June 2018, Etihad reported a net loss of US$1.52 billion for 2017.

In February 2019, Etihad announced large order cancellations for both Airbus and Boeing aircraft. The airline terminated contracts for all 42 Airbus A350-900s, two A350-1000s and 19 of 24 ordered Boeing 777X.

On 1 May 2021, it was announced Etihad Airways sold its 40% stake in Air Seychelles back to the Government of Seychelles.

On 13 May 2023, the Serbian Government announced it had finished acquiring 100% equity in Air Serbia, after several years of buying back stakes from Etihad.

=== Impact of COVID-19 ===
In May 2020, shortly after Air France retired its entire Airbus A380 fleet due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were rumors that Etihad Airways was considering canceling all its remaining Airbus A350 orders and retiring its entire Airbus A380 fleet due to more financial losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Etihad&#x27;s CEO Tony Douglas said that Etihad&#x27;s A380 fleet was very likely not to fly again in passenger service, and therefore likely to be withdrawn after only seven years in service. This move would make Etihad the third Airbus A380 operator to retire its Airbus A380 fleet, following Air France-KLM and Hi Fly Malta. However, by 26 May 2020, Etihad confirmed that the airline will not cancel its remaining Airbus A350 orders and plans to proceed with them. The airline also confirmed that it had no plans to ditch its Airbus A380 fleet into early retirement, unlike Air France, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, as of October 2020, some sources stated that the Etihad Airbus A380 still had a potential possibility of early retirement due to the aircraft market changes and demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as Douglas referred to the Airbus A380 as a heavily inefficient handicapped behemoth by two engines too many. Douglas also said that smaller long-range twin-jet aircraft such as the Boeing 777X, 787, and Airbus A350 can do the job far more efficiently and sustainably than that of the A380.

In February 2021, Etihad Airways vaccinated all its operating pilots and cabin crew against COVID-19, the first airline to vaccinate all its operating pilots and cabin crew. Since most of Etihad&#x27;s flights were grounded between March and June 2020, the airline&#x27;s passenger traffic dropped by 76% to 4.2 million in 2020. Throughout 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Etihad Airways laid off over 1,000 cabin crew and pilots. Etihad had reported significant losses even before the pandemic; since 2016, it lost over $5.62 billion and in 2019 losses amounted to $870 million. The airline&#x27;s full-year losses amounted to $1.7 billion in 2020, and $476 million in 2021.

=== Return to profitability ===
In July 2022, Etihad announced a record-breaking first-half profitability of $296 million. This was achieved due to the increased passenger travel demand. Etihad carried 3 million more passengers in the first half of 2022, compared to the first half of 2021. In October 2022 Etihad Airways was transferred ownership over to Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ. Etihad, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Airports, Etihad Holidays, and more were all brought into common ownership. Although the airline had grounded its fleet of 10 A380-800 aircraft with no initial plans to redeploy the aircraft, it was decided that they would return to service. In 2023, Etihad redeployed four of their 10 jumbo jets onto their London Heathrow service, with later decisions that an additional A380 would return to the fleet.

The airline later announced the redeployment of their A380 to their New York JFK route in April 2024 as well as to Paris Charles de Gaulle from November 2024 as well as Singapore Changi from February 2025. During the [Gaza war]], many airlines interrupted their flights to Tel Aviv airport; but Etihad Airways and Flydubai kept up multiple flights daily, helping Israel remain connected to the wider world. This was a symbol of &quot;UAE’s commitment&quot; to maintaining strong ties with Israel.

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office===
Etihad has its head office in Khalifa City, Abu Dhabi, near Abu Dhabi International Airport. Etihad spent 183.6 million UAE dirhams (US$50 million) in 2007 to have its new head office and training center built. The new head office was completed in 2007.

===Structure===

Etihad is governed by a board of directors chaired by Mohamed Mubarak Al Mazrouei and operates in terms of its founding legislation and the Articles of Association of the company. The board consists of seven independent non-executive members and has two sub-committees, an executive committee and an Audit Committee, each with its charter and chairman. Other members of the board include Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, H. E. Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Mohamed Hareb Sultan Al Yousef, Hamad Abdulla Al Shamsi, Khalifa Sultan Al Suwaidi, and Ahmed Ali Matar Al Romaithi.

The airline was led previously by James Hogan (formerly CEO of Gulf Air) who was appointed as president and chief executive officer from 10 September 2006 until January 2018. He was succeeded by Tony Douglas, who held the post until October 2022. The current CEO of Etihad Group is Antonoaldo Neves.

===Etihad Airways equity alliance===

Etihad&#x27;s equity alliance was composed of airlines in which Etihad had minority shareholdings. These consisted of stakes in Air Berlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, and Virgin Australia. As of year-end 2023, Etihad has exited all of these holdings. With Virgin Australia&#x27;s bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring, the company&#x27;s shareholding in the airline ended in its entirety. In late December 2020, the government of Serbia recapitalized Air Serbia, increasing its stake to 82%, thus decreasing Etihad&#x27;s stake to 18%. The airline company was also a part of the now-disbanded Etihad Airways Partners alliance between 2015 and 2018.

===Cargo===
Etihad Cargo, formerly &quot;Etihad Crystal Cargo&quot;, is the dedicated freight operations branch of Etihad. The carrier refreshed its brand image in June 2012 dropping the &quot;Crystal&quot; part, with full Etihad Cargo titles now applied billboard-style in line with the airline&#x27;s current corporate design. Etihad Cargo operates six Boeing 777Fs. It has previously operated a Boeing 747-400F and Boeing 747-8F, both leased from Atlas Air but operated in full Etihad Cargo colors. In January 2018, Etihad announced it would retire and either sell or lease out its five relatively new Airbus A330-200F freighters due to a change in strategy and reduction of freight capacity. In August 2018, it was announced that all five A330 freighters had been sold to DHL Aviation.

Etihad Cargo delivered 368,000 tonnes of cargo in 2012, a tonnage growth of 19 percent on the back of a capacity increase of 14 percent in available tonnage kilometers. Etihad&#x27;s new facility at Zayed International Airport is equipped to handle more than 500,000 tonnes annually. In September 2018, Etihad Cargo announced a revised and heavily downsized network of cargo destinations to reflect the reduced fleet and a focus on core freight operations.
==Destinations==

As of June 2023, Etihad serves 81 passenger and cargo destinations across Africa, Europe, North America, Asia and Australia from its hub at Zayed International Airport. Until terminating the São Paulo service in late March 2017, Etihad Airways was one of the few carriers to have passenger services to all six inhabited continents.

As 2021 began, the airline suspended its flights to South Africa as a part of its ongoing review of network performance. Etihad opened a twice-weekly route to Tel Aviv, Israel, in April 2021. Later in June 2023, the airline announced expansions of some routes such as expanding the frequency of flights to Rome from Abu Dhabi from seven to eleven times per week.

On 25 November 2024, Etihad made a public announcement of the 10 new destinations of the national airline of UAE as part of their rapid expansion program. The destinations are Algiers, Atlanta, Chiang Mai, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Krabi, Medan, Phnom Penh, Taipei and Tunis.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Etihad Airways grounded all 10 Airbus A380-800 aircraft and initially had no plans to return them to service after the pandemic. However, since 2023, four Airbus A380-800s returned to services, flying on the route to London–Heathrow; in 2024, A380 service resumed to New York–JFK and Paris–Charles de Gaulle. Although Etihad placed an order for 25 Boeing 777X aircraft in 2013, by May 2024, CEO Antonoaldo Neves confirmed that the contracts with Boeing had been restructured. As a result, Etihad now holds an option to purchase the 777X planes but also has the option to acquire more 787s. Neves further clarified that the 777X is not part of Etihad&#x27;s five-year plan.

== Livery ==

=== Present livery ===

The present livery – named &quot;Facets of Abu Dhabi&quot; – was unveiled in September 2014 on the first of the airline&#x27;s new A380s. It features a golden and silver triangular tessellation on the vertical stabilizer and rear fuselage. A golden Etihad logo and a UAE emblem over the windows, with the UAE flag painted on the front door. The background was painted in light beige and the wingtip also has a UAE emblem. The golden color was inspired by the color of the Arabian desert.

=== Former livery (2003–2017) ===

The former livery features a UAE flag and the national falcon emblem on the vertical stabilizer and a golden Etihad logo on the windows. Red and golden stripes were painted on the fuselage. This livery is still present on a few Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A320s.

Similar partnership exists for the Scandinavian Airlines loyalty program Eurobonus, where members can earn and spend bonus points on selected flights. &quot;Etihad guest&quot; loyalty members are rewarded with Etihad miles when they book accommodations through booking.com as a result of a deal signed between booking.com and Etihad Airways in 2019.

==Accidents and incidents==
, Etihad Airways has not suffered any fatal accidents during passenger operations.
*15 November 2007 – A new A340-600, registration A6-EHG, due for delivery to Etihad Airways was damaged beyond repair during ground testing at Airbus&#x27; facilities at Toulouse Blagnac International Airport in France. During a pre-delivery engine test, multiple safety systems had been disabled by engineers, leading to the non-chocked aircraft accelerating to 31 knots (57 km/h) and colliding with a concrete blast deflection wall. Severe damage was inflicted on the aircraft and nine people on board were injured, four of them seriously. The right-wing, tail and left engines made contact with the ground or wall, leaving the forward section of the aircraft elevated several meters and the cockpit broke off.

<text>is a 1993 Japanese animated &quot;jidaigeki&quot;-&quot;chanbara&quot; film written and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, starring the voices of Kōichi Yamadera, Emi Shinohara, Takeshi Aono, Daisuke Gōri, Toshihiko Seki and Shūichirō Moriyama. The film was produced by Animate Film and distributed by Tokyo Theatres Company. &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; was theatrically released in Japan on June 5, 1993, and received an English-dubbed release through Manga Entertainment in 1995.

The film takes place in feudal Japan and follows Kibagami Jubei, a mercenary swordsman who battles the Eight Devils of Kimon, a team of ninjas with supernatural powers who are intent on overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate. During his quest, he is aided by Dakuan, an elderly but crafty government spy, and Kagero, a Kōga kunoichi whose body is infused with toxins.

Praised for its animation and action scenes, &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; is regarded by many as one of the most influential anime films ever made. Alongside &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, it was responsible for increasing the popularity of adult-oriented anime outside of Japan. The film has been cited by The Wachowskis as an influence on the &quot;Matrix&quot; franchise, and resulted in Kawajiri later contributing to two segments of the anthology film &quot;The Animatrix&quot;.

A televised sequel, &quot;Ninja Scroll: The Series&quot;, was aired in Japan in 2003.

==Plot==

In Edo period-Japan, the mines gold in secret, and sends a shipment to the Toyotomi as payment for his protection. The Shogun of the Dark intends to use the gold to buy advanced Spanish weaponry and overthrow the current government, the Tokugawa Shogunate. The ship runs aground onto in a storm, and the , a ninja team with supernatural powers in the employ of the Yamashiro, kill the people of the nearby to keep the gold shipment a secret.

While investigating the deaths, a Mochizuki Kōga ninja team is massacred by the Devils. The sole survivor, the kunoichi , is captured by a Devil, , who attempts to rape her. She is rescued by , a mercenary ex-Yamashiro ninja, who fights and eventually kills Tessai. , a Tokugawa spy, blackmails Jubei into helping him kill the remaining Devils. To ensure his compliance, Dakuan stabs Jubei with a poisoned shuriken, and promises to give him an antidote once the mission is complete. Jubei learns from Dakuan that the leader of the Devils is , the former Yamashiro ninja leader, who had ordered his team&#x27;s members to kill each other to cover up the location of the goldmine five years earlier. Jubei, who had been forced to kill his comrades to survive, decapitated Gemma in revenge; Gemma survived due to his immortality.
Jubei is attacked by another Devil, , but he is saved by Kagero; before she can be questioned, Benisato is killed from afar by , Gemma&#x27;s right-hand man, for failing her mission. Kagero agrees to work alongside Jubei and Dakuan, who informs Jubei that her body is infused with such deadly toxins that anyone who kisses or sleeps with her dies, which was why Jubei could kill Tessai.

The trio arrive in Shimoda, where they discover that the villagers died due to their water supply being poisoned, making it appear that they were killed by a plague. Jubei and Kagero fend off attacks from three of the Devils – , , and ; Jubei succeeds in killing Mushizo and Utsutsu. After finding the beached ship, Kagero deduces that the gold has been taken to Kashima Harbor, where it will be transported to the Shogun of the Dark in another ship.

Jubei, Kagero, and Dakuan arrive at Kashima, which has been evacuated due to the townspeople&#x27;s fear of the plague. While Jubei battles another Devil, , Kagero sends a message to , the Mochizuki chamberlain, to bring his army to the harbor. She also learns from Dakuan that Jubei&#x27;s poisoning will only be cured if he copulates with her – the poisons in her body will counteract his. Kagero is captured by Shijima, and Jubei kills him, rescuing her once more. Kagero asks Jubei to sleep with her to cure himself. He decides against it, and upon the arrival of the Shogun of the Dark&#x27;s envoy in a ship, he leaves to prevent the gold reaching its destination.

Kagero arrives to meet Sakaki, but he stabs her, revealing himself to be Gemma in disguise as he had murdered the real one days before. Enraged, Jubei fights through waves of ninjas, but is nearly killed by Yurimaru. A gunpowder-rigged rat, left as a trap by Zakuro for Yurimaru for rejecting her advances, kills him, allowing Jubei to escape. He finds Kagero; mortally wounded, she admits her love for him and they kiss, curing Jubei&#x27;s poisoning. Before dying, Kagero gives Jubei her headband.

Jubei and Dakuan board the departing ship. On board, Gemma reveals his true intentions – to use the gold to raise a ninja army to terrorize Japan rather than serve as an ally to the Toyotomi – to a masked samurai who serves as the Shogun of the Dark&#x27;s envoy, and proceeds to kill him. During an altercation with Zakuro, Jubei and Dakuan set the ship ablaze. As Jubei and Gemma engage in a brutal fight, the gold becomes molten and engulfs Gemma, who sinks to the bottom of the sea. Afterwards, Dakuan thanks Jubei, and expresses admiration for his and Kagero&#x27;s humanity. Jubei resumes his vagabond lifestyle, with Kagero&#x27;s headband tied around his sword&#x27;s hilt.

==Cast==
==Development==
&quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;&#x27;s story and style was influenced by the works of novelist Futaro Yamada and Western spy fiction, with Jubei&#x27;s character being loosely based on the historical figure Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi. Kawajiri considered it difficult to adapt Yamada&#x27;s works into animation, and opted for a simple depiction. He stated that he found simplifying the storyline to be the most challenging aspect. The choice to contain lots of expository dialogue was considered necessary, due to younger audiences not being familiar with the culture of historical dramas.

The film was originally meant to consist of two films, being 45 minutes each. The storyboard was written this way, which is why there are climax scenes in the first and second half of the film.

==Release==
The film was licensed by Manga Entertainment in Australia and North America until 2012 while its UK subsidiary kept the license and released the movie in a Blu-ray steelbook format in October 2012. The film has since been re-licensed in North America to Sentai Filmworks who re-released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in December 2012.

In 1995, the BBFC cut the UK version by approximately 52 seconds, removing the sexual assault scene and images of throwing stars. These cuts were waived for the 2004 10th Anniversary release. &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; was released in Australia by Manga UK in 1995 uncut with the MA15+ classification. In 1997 after it was screened on SBS, former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock controversially appealed the film&#x27;s original classification and successfully had the classification upgraded to R18+ with no cuts. In January 1998 it broadcast twice on midnights on the new Teletoon station in Canada along with episodes of the Macross Plus OVA series.

GKIDS later announced that it would distribute the film within North America, with a theatrical release scheduled for April 2018.

In 2000 when Manga and Madman Entertainment released &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; on DVD, Madman mistakenly used the UK cut of the film instead of using the uncut Australian version. This was rectified in 2004 when Manga Entertainment released the &quot;10th Anniversary Special Edition of Ninja Scroll&quot; into western countries, and both Australia and the UK received &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; uncut and remastered from a PAL VHS source. In Canada the film was given an 18A rating, while it was released Unrated in the United States. The film was released on Blu-ray in Japan on May 23, 2012.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s score was composed by Kaoru Wada. In the United States, the soundtrack was originally released on CD in 2003 by ADV Music under licence from Toho with the title &quot;Jubei Ninpucho Ninja Scroll (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)&quot;. Following ADV&#x27;s closure, Milan Records re-released the album in 2015 on CD and digital music formats. In 2016, Milan also released the album on LP with a slightly different track listing and cover art by &quot;Godzilla&quot; artist Yuji Kaida; this release was limited to 500 copies.

==Reception==
&quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; won the Citizen&#x27;s Award at the 1993 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 89%, based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

During the 1990s, &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; was among the most popular anime movies outside Japan, along with such movies as &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. The North American video release of &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; had sold more than 70,000 copies by May 1996, becoming Manga Entertainment&#x27;s best-selling title at the time. In February 2004, &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; listed the anime as one of the &quot;10 Essential Animations&quot;.

Theron Martin from &quot;Anime News Network&quot; stated that the &quot;action scenes sizzle with energy and powerful maneuvers unencumbered by tiresome dramatics&quot; and further stated that the plot &quot;mostly exists just to set up conflicts between the protagonists and the Devils of Kimon and allow various characters to show off their colorful ninja techniques&quot;. He concluded that &quot;&quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;″s story is too thin for it to ever legitimately be considered one of the all-time great anime movies&quot; but considers it to be a classic. He stated that the dubbed English version, which he stated has &quot;slightly more attitude and some distinctive vocal styling mixed in with an occasional awkward emphasis&quot;, is &quot;very faithful&quot; script-wise to the original Japanese version and that it still &quot;holds its own&quot; in 2012.

In 2012, Robbie Collin of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; ranked it three of five stars, explaining that &quot;Its baroque sadism and sexism hasn&#x27;t aged well, but it still packs a visceral kick.&quot;

==Legacy==

===Anime series===

A Japanese animated television series named &quot;Ninja Scroll: The Series&quot; aired in Japan in 2003 and ran for 13 episodes. The series is a stand-alone sequel to the film; however, many references suggest that it is indeed a continuation. In the series, Jubei gets caught in the middle of a battle between the Kimon clan and the Hiruko clan. He meets up with the Light Maiden Shigure, a young lady whose village was destroyed by the Kimon clan and whom Jubei was charged with delivering a Dragon Stone to. The duo are joined by Tsubute (a young thief) and Dakuan (Tokugawa shogunate spy), and together they try to find out why both the Kimon and the Hiruko clan are after her and why the Dragon Stone she carries is so important to them. The show was directed by Tatsuo Sato (&quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot;), with character design done by Takahiro Yoshimatsu (&quot;Trigun&quot;).

===Sequel===
In August 2008, Madhouse announced that an official sequel was in the works with Kawajiri returning to write and direct. In July 2012, the studio released a teaser trailer for a &quot;three-episode short animation&quot; titled &quot;Ninja Scroll Burst&quot;, intended to attract investors to the project. In February 2014, Madhouse CEO Hiroyuki Okada confirmed that Kawajiri had a finished script, tentatively titled , and that production would move ahead as soon as financing had been secured. He also divulged that the studio was experiencing difficulty finding investors due to the fact that the original film was &quot;not a big hit in Japan&quot;. As of 2019, the project remains in limbo.

In North America, the &quot;Ninja Resurrection&quot; original video animation was marketed as a sequel to &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, but was actually based on an unrelated story and created by a different animation studio. The only similarity is a lead character with the given name &quot;Jubei&quot;.

===Comics===
In September 2006, WildStorm launched a 12-issue &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; comic-book series written by J. Torres, which follows the further adventures of Jubei.

==== Live-action adaptation ====
In October 2008, it was reported that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to develop a live-action adaptation of &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, with Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s Appian Way Productions, Madhouse, and Japanese producer Jungo Maruta also involved in the project. Screenwriter Alex Tse, who co-wrote the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, was hired to write the screenplay. In April 2009, it was reported that DiCaprio would act as producer, and was considering casting the Japanese boy band SMAP in the lead roles. In October 2015, &quot;Dracula Untold&quot; director Gary Shore revealed he had once been attached to direct the film, releasing a proof of concept trailer he had produced with motion capture by 87Eleven and animation by The Third Floor. As of 2018, the production remains in development hell.

<text>New Zealand has over 2,500 primary and secondary schools.

State schools and state integrated schools are primarily funded by the central government. Private schools receive a lower level of state funding (about 25% of their costs). See Secondary education in New Zealand for more details.

Population decline in rural and some urban areas has led to school closures in recent decades. This was a much debated topic in 2003–2004.

<text>The Governor Alfred E. Driscoll Bridge, (colloquially referred to as the Driscoll Bridge) is a bridge on the Garden State Parkway in the U.S. state of New Jersey, spanning the Raritan River near its mouth in Raritan Bay. The bridge connects the Middlesex County communities of Woodbridge Township on the north with Sayreville on the south. With a total of 15 travel lanes and 6 shoulder lanes, it is one of the world&#x27;s widest and busiest motor vehicle bridges. Only 30 feet east of the Driscoll Bridge is the Edison Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 9. The bridge offers views of some of the taller buildings in the Lower Manhattan skyline, the New Brunswick skyline, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and the Outerbridge Crossing.

==History==
The northbound lanes of the bridge were opened to the public without fanfare on July 30, 1954.

In 1955, a new pier was built to allow for potential expansion.

The span was originally built with two lanes in each direction, however this quickly proved to be inadequate, and in an attempt to reduce congestion, the bridge was restriped with six 10&#x27; foot lanes in 1957.

In 1970, an expansion project began. The bridge was closed for reconstruction, to allow for the installation of a third column built on the 1955 piers in addition to a fully divided roadway deck. Work was completed in 1972, at which point the bridge was converted to serving ten lanes of traffic total.

The bridge was formally renamed in 1974 for former Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, who advocated for and oversaw the construction of the Garden State Parkway and New Jersey Turnpike.

In 1984, the timber medians were replaced with concrete barriers, allowing for the addition of one lane in each direction.

By the 2000s, the bridge were inadequate, as its narrowness and lack of emergency lanes created bottlenecks in each direction. Because of this, the bridge was later restriped to have twelve ten foot lanes, six in each direction.
Construction on a new southbound bridge started on September 25, 2002, and the new bridge opened to traffic on May 3, 2006. The existing span was then closed for rehabilitation, and it reopened on May 20, 2009, with eight lanes and two shoulders. The new configuration has seven southbound lanes on the newly constructed span on Parkway South, and the existing span was reduced from twelve lanes to eight lanes, with the other two converted into shoulders. The northbound span is also divided, with four lanes on each side. There are a total of five lanes of Parkway North traffic and three right lanes at Exit 127 meaning that the west side contains four lanes for through traffic on the Parkway, and the east side contains three right lanes for Exit 127 and one lane for through traffic on the Parkway. For a time, the bridge&#x27;s 15 travel lanes and 6 shoulder lanes made it &quot;the widest motor-vehicle bridge in the world by number of lanes&quot;, according to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

A project to repaint the original bridge began in 2012.

The speed limit on the Garden State Parkway was approaching and traversing the Driscoll Bridge. However, in February 2020, the speed limit was raised to .

==Tolls==
All southbound traffic crossing the Driscoll Bridge pays a toll at either the Raritan Toll Plaza or at exit 125 on the Garden State Parkway, which is just north of the toll plaza. As of January 1, 2023, the toll for passenger cars at the Raritan Toll Plaza is $2.10 with cash and $2.02 with E-ZPass. Southbound exit 125 is for E-ZPass users only and also has a toll of $2.02.

==Murder on the bridge==
On February 17, 2010, Shamshiddin Abdur-Raheem was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his daughter by throwing her off the bridge. The body of an infant matching the girl&#x27;s description was found on the south bank of the Raritan River on April 24 and was later identified as the missing girl through DNA testing.

<text>Sir Patrick Geddes (2 October 1854 – 17 April 1932) was a Scottish biologist, sociologist, Comtean positivist, geographer, philanthropist and pioneering town planner. He is known for his innovative thinking in the fields of urban planning and sociology. His works contain one of the earliest examples of the &#x27;think globally, act locally&#x27; concept in social science. 

Following the philosophies of Auguste Comte and Frederic LePlay, he introduced the concept of &quot;region&quot; to architecture and planning and coined the term &quot;conurbation&quot;. Later, he elaborated &quot;neotechnics&quot; as the way of remaking a world apart from over-commercialization and money dominance.

An energetic Francophile, Geddes was the founder in 1924 of the Collège des Écossais (Scots College), an international teaching establishment in Montpellier, France, and in the 1920s he bought the Château d&#x27;Assas to set up a centre for urban studies.

== Biography ==
The son of Janet Stevenson and soldier Alexander Geddes, Patrick Geddes was born in Ballater and the Old Parish Register for baptisms in the parish of Glenmuick Tullich and Glengairn recorded his first name as &#x27;Peter&#x27;. He was educated in Aberdeenshire, and at Perth Academy.

He studied at the Royal College of Mines in London under Thomas Henry Huxley between 1874 and 1877, never finishing any degree and he then spent the year 1877-1878 as a demonstrator in the Department of Physiology in University College London where he met Charles Darwin in Burdon-Sanderson&#x27;s laboratory. While in London, he became acquainted with Comtean Positivism, as promoted by Richard Congreve, and he converted to the Religion of Humanity. He was elected as a member of the London Positivist Society. Later he raised his children to worship &#x27;Humanity&#x27; following the Positivist system of belief. He lectured in Zoology at Edinburgh University from 1880 to 1888.

From 1888 to 1918, Geddes worked as a Professor of Botany at the University of Dundee.

He married Anna Morton (1857–1917), who was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, in 1886 when he was 32 years old. They had three children: Norah, Alasdair and Arthur. During a visit to India in 1917, Anna fell ill with typhoid fever and died, not knowing that their son Alasdair had been killed in action in France. Their daughter was the landscape designer Norah Geddes, who was active in Geddes&#x27;s Open Spaces projects; she married the architect and planner Frank Charles Mears.

In 1890, he assisted John Wilson in laying out a teaching garden at Morgan Academy in Dundee.

Between 1894 and 1914, he served as an active member of the ruling Council of the Cockburn Association, a campaigning conservation organisation founded in Edinburgh in 1875.

In 1895, Geddes published an edition of &quot;The Evergreen&quot; magazine, with articles on nature, biology and poetics. Artists Robert Burns and John Duncan provided illustrations for the magazine.

Geddes wrote with J. Arthur Thomson an early book on &quot;The Evolution of Sex&quot; (1889). He held the Chair of Botany at University College Dundee from 1888 to 1919, and the Chair of Sociology at the University of Bombay from 1919 to 1924. He inspired Victor Branford to form the Sociological Society in 1903 to promote his sociological views.

While he thought of himself primarily as a sociologist, it was his commitment to close social observation and ability to turn these into practical solutions for city design and improvement that earned him a &quot;revered place amongst the founding fathers of the British town planning movement&quot;. He was a major influence on the American urban theorist Lewis Mumford.

He was knighted in 1932, shortly before his death at the Scots College in Montpellier, France on 17 April 1932.

==Town planning career==

Patrick Geddes was influenced by social theorists such as Auguste Comte (1798–1857), Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), and French theorist Frederic Le Play (1806–1882) and expanded upon earlier theoretical developments that led to the concept of regional planning.

He was a proponent of the Comte-LePlay view of the interconnectedness of city region as a potentially autonomous unit. He adopted Spencer&#x27;s theory that the concept of biological evolution could be applied to explain the evolution of society, and drew on Le Play&#x27;s analysis of the key units of society as constituting &quot;Lieu, Travail, Famille&quot; (&quot;Place, Work, Family&quot;), but changing the last from &quot;family&quot; to &quot;folk&quot;. In this theory, the family is viewed as the central &quot;biological unit of human society&quot; from which all else develops. According to Geddes, it is from &quot;stable, healthy homes&quot; providing the necessary conditions for mental and moral development that come beautiful and healthy children who are able &quot;to fully participate in life&quot;.

Geddes drew on Le Play&#x27;s circular theory of geographical locations presenting environmental limitations and opportunities that in turn determine the nature of work. His central argument was that physical geography, market economics and anthropology were related, yielding a &quot;single chord of social life [of] all three combined&quot;. Thus the interdisciplinary subject of sociology was developed into the science of &quot;man’s interaction with a natural environment: the basic technique was the regional survey, and the improvement of town planning the chief practical application of sociology&quot;.

Geddes&#x27; writing demonstrates the influence of these ideas on his theories of the city. He saw the city as a series of common interlocking patterns, &quot;an inseparably interwoven structure&quot;, akin to a flower. He criticised the tendency of modern scientific thinking to specialisation. In his &quot;Report to the H.H. the Maharaja of Kapurthala&quot; in 1917 he wrote: 
&quot;Each of the various specialists remains too closely concentrated upon his single specialism, too little awake to those of the others. Each sees clearly and seizes firmly upon one petal of the six-lobed flower of life and tears it apart from the whole.&quot;

These ideas can also be traced back to Geddes&#x27; abiding interest in Eastern philosophy which he believed more readily conceived of &quot;life as a whole&quot;: &quot;as a result, civic beauty in India has existed at all levels, from humble homes and simple shrines to palaces magnificent and temples sublime.&quot;

Geddes distinguished two forms of human social life: ‘paleotechnic’ and ‘neotechnic.’ He viewed the former as self-destructive but the latter as self-supporting. In the context of cities, paleotechnic cities are those characterized by competition while neotechnic is characterized by interaction. Additionally, this is followed by the paleotechnic city’s desire for expansion as compared to the neotechnic city’s ability to form communities and conurbations. Geddes attributed the destruction of cities via World War I not to the invasion of imperialist powers but the prevalence of paleotechnic forms of life in European society.

Against a backdrop of extraordinary development of new technologies, industrialisation and urbanism, Geddes witnessed the substantial social consequences of crime, illness and poverty that developed as a result of modernisation. From Geddes&#x27; perspective, the purpose of his theory and understanding of relationships among the units of society was to find an equilibrium among people and the environment to improve such conditions.

== Key ideas ==
=== &quot;Conservative surgery&quot; versus the gridiron plan ===
Geddes championed a mode of planning that sought to consider &quot;primary human needs&quot; in every intervention, engaging in &quot;constructive and conservative surgery&quot; rather than the &quot;heroic, all of a piece schemes&quot; popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He continued to use and advocate for this approach throughout his career.

Very early on in his career Geddes demonstrated the practicality of his ideas and approach. In 1886 Geddes and his wife, Anna Geddes, purchased a row of slum tenements in James Court, Edinburgh, making it into a single dwelling. In and around this area Geddes commenced upon a project of &quot;conservative surgery&quot;: &quot;weeding out the worst of the houses that surrounded them…widening the narrow closes into courtyards&quot; and thus improving sunlight and airflow. The best of the houses were kept and restored. Geddes believed that this approach was both more economical and more humane.

In this way Geddes consciously worked against the tradition of the &quot;gridiron plan&quot;, resurgent in colonial town design in the 19th century:
&quot;The heritage of the gridiron plans goes back at least to the Roman camps. The basis for the grid as an enduring and appealing urban form rests on five main characteristics: order and regulatory, orientation in space and to elements, simplicity and ease of navigation, speed of layout, and adaptability to circumstance&quot;. 
However, he wished this policy of &quot;sweeping clearances&quot; to be recognised for what he believed it was: &quot;one of the most disastrous and pernicious blunders in the chequered history of sanitation&quot;.

Geddes criticised this tradition as much for its &quot;dreary conventionality&quot; as for its failure to address in the long term the very problems it purport to solve. According to Geddes&#x27; analysis, this approach was not only &quot;unsparing to the old homes and to the neighbourhood life of the area&quot; but also, in &quot;leaving fewer housing sites and these mostly narrower than before&quot; expelling a large population that would &quot;again as usual, be driven to create worse congestion in other quarters&quot;.

== The &quot;observational technique&quot; ==

Drawing on the scientific method, Geddes encouraged close observation as the way to discover and work with the relationships among place, work and folk. In 1892, to allow the general public an opportunity to observe these relationships, Geddes opened a &quot;sociological laboratory&quot; called the Outlook Tower that documented and visualized the regional landscape. In keeping with scientific process and using new technologies, Geddes developed an Index Museum to categorise his physical observations and maintained Encyclopedia Graphicato, which used a camera obscura to provide an opportunity for the general public to observe their own landscape to witness the relationships among units of society. Geddes would host tours throughout the tower and boast its maps, photographs, and projection via ‘camera obscura’ in order to present the sociological dimensions of cities, urban problems, and town planning. During his tours he would use the camera obscura on the top floor to demonstrate the outlook of an artist then take visitors to the balcony to show the outlook of technical professionals like geologists, geographers, etc. He used specific instruments and tools to better convey the outlook different people had of the region. The Outlook Tower is a physical assertion of Geddes belief in the importance of all areas of knowledge; all arts, all sciences, all, religions, all cultures, etc. The Outlook Tower embodies the integration of local, the regional, and the global aspects of knowledge. Geddes used it as a tool for cultural and regional analysis and provided space for many thinkers to explore the idea of &#x27;regions&#x27; which he later introduced to the field of planning. The Outlook Tower is located in Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town and still exists today as Camera Obscura &amp; World of Illusions.

=== The &quot;civic survey&quot; ===
Geddes advocated the civic survey as indispensable to urban planning: his motto was &quot;diagnosis before treatment&quot;. Such a survey should include, at a minimum, the geology, the geography, the climate, the economic life, and the social institutions of the city and region. His early work surveying the city of Edinburgh became a model for later surveys.

He was particularly critical of that form of planning which relied overmuch on design and effect, neglecting to consider &quot;the surrounding quarter and constructed without reference to local needs or potentialities&quot;. Geddes encouraged instead exploration and consideration of the &quot;whole set of existing conditions&quot;, studying the &quot;place as it stands, seeking out how it has grown to be what it is, and recognising alike its advantages, its difficulties and its defects&quot;:
&quot;This school strives to adapt itself to meet the wants and needs, the ideas and ideals of the place and persons concerned. It seeks to undo as little as possible, while planning to increase the well-being of the people at all levels, from the humblest to the highest.&quot;

In this sense he can be viewed as prefiguring the work of seminal urban thinkers such as Jane Jacobs, and region-specific planning movements such as New Urbanism, encouraging the planner to consider the situation, inherent virtue and potential in a given site, rather than &quot;an abstract ideal that could be imposed by authority or force from the outside&quot;.

=== The regional plan ===

In 1909, Geddes assisted in the early planning of the southern aspect of the Zoological Gardens in Edinburgh. This work was formative in his development of a regional planning model called the &quot;Valley Section&quot;.This model illustrated the complex interactions among biogeography, geomorphology and human systems and attempted to demonstrate how &quot;natural occupations&quot; such as hunting, mining, or fishing are supported by physical geographies that in turn determine patterns of human settlement. The point of this model was to make clear the complex and interrelated relationships between humans and their environment, and to encourage regional planning models that would be responsive to these conditions.

== Civic pageant ==
Geddes developed a means for engaging with the populace of a city through a civic pageant. One such was the &quot;Masque of Learning&quot;, a pageant he organised in the Poole&#x27;s Synod Hall, Edinburgh in 1912. He also organised a pageant in Indore, India when he arrived in 1917.

== Work in India ==
Geddes&#x27; work in improving the slums of Edinburgh led to an invitation from Lord Pentland (then Governor of Madras) to travel to India to advise on emerging urban planning issues, in particular, how to mediate &quot;between the need for public improvement and respect for existing social standards&quot;. For this, Geddes prepared an exhibition on &quot;City and Town Planning&quot;. The materials for the first exhibit were sent to India on a ship that was sunk near Madras by the German ship Emden, however new materials were collected and an exhibit prepared for the Senate hall of Madras University by 1915.

Once arriving in India, Geddes toured multiple Indian cities and was overwhelmed by Indian architecture and planning. Geddes was impressed by the historical piety valued in Indian planning displayed by the seamless merger of traditional temples within the urban fabric of Indian cities. Geddes believed that this was indicative of a city&#x27;s genius loci which is often established by a visually dominant building in a city like a medieval cathedral or an antique temple in the urban fabric. Geddes was outspoken in his town-planning reports about the “insensitivity of British colonial administration towards the historic Indian architecture and urban environment” and denounced their methods of planning which included drastic and destructive changes to the urban fabric.

According to some reports, this was near the time of the meeting of the Indian National Congress and Pentland hoped the exhibit would demonstrate the benefits of British rule. Geddes lectured and worked with Indian surveyors and travelled to Bombay and Bengal where Pentland&#x27;s political allies Lord Willingdon and Lord Carmichael were Governors. He held a position in Sociology and Civics at Bombay University from 1919 to 1925.

Between 1915 and 1919 Geddes wrote a series of &quot;exhaustive town planning reports&quot; on at least eighteen Indian cities, a selection of which has been collected together in Jacqueline Tyrwhitt’s &quot;Patrick Geddes in India&quot; (1947).

Through these reports, Geddes was concerned to create a &quot;working system in India&quot;, righting the wrongs of the past by making interventions in and plans for the urban fabric that were both considerate of local context and tradition and awake to the need for development. According to Lewis Mumford, writing in introduction to Tyrwhitt’s collected reports:
&quot;Few observers have shown more sympathy…with the religious and social practices of the Hindus than Geddes did; yet no one could have written more scathingly of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s attempt to conserve the past by reverting to the spinning wheel, at a moment when the fundamental poverty of the masses in India called for the most resourceful application of the machine both to agricultural and industrial life.&quot;

His principles for town planning in Bombay demonstrate his views on the relationship between social processes and spatial form, and the intimate and causal connections between the social development of the individual and the cultural and physical environment. They included: (&quot;What town planning means under the Bombay Town Planning Act of 1915&quot;)
* Preservation of human life and energy, rather than superficial beautification.
* Conformity to an orderly development plan carried out in stages.
* Purchasing land suitable for building.
* Promoting trade and commerce.
* Preserving historic buildings and buildings of religious significance.
* Developing a city worthy of civic pride, not an imitation of European cities.
* Promoting the happiness, health and comfort of all residents, rather than focusing on roads and parks available only to the rich.
* Control over future growth with adequate provision for future requirements.

Geddes&#x27; exhortation to pay attention to the social and particular when attempting city renewal or resettlement remains relevant, particularly in light of the plans for slum resettlement and redevelopment ongoing in many Indian cities (see, e.g. Dharavi redevelopment program):
&quot;Town Planning is not mere place-planning, nor even work planning. If it is to be successful it must be folk planning. This means that its task is not to coerce people into new places against their associations, wishes, and interest, as we find bad schemes trying to do. Instead its task is to find the right places for each sort of people; place where they will really flourish. To give people in fact the same care that we give when transplanting flowers, instead of harsh evictions and arbitrary instructions to &#x27;move on&#x27;, delivered in the manner of an officious policeman.&quot;

== Work in Palestine ==

Geddes worked with his son-in-law, the architect Frank Mears, on a number of projects in Palestine. In 1919, he designed a plan for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem at the request of the psychoanalyst, Dr. David Eder, who headed the World Zionist Organization&#x27;s London Branch. He also submitted a report on &quot;Jerusalem Actual and Possible&quot; to the Military Governor of Jerusalem in November 1919. In 1925 he submitted a report on town planning in Jaffa and Tel Aviv to the Municipality of Tel Aviv, then led by Meir Dizengoff. The municipality adopted his proposals and Tel Aviv is the only city whose core is entirely laid out according to a plan by Geddes.

==Recognition and legacy==
Geddes&#x27; ideas had worldwide circulation: his most famous admirer was the American urban theorist Lewis Mumford who claimed that &quot;Geddes was a global thinker in practice, a whole generation or more before the Western democracies fought a global war&quot;.

Geddes also influenced several British urban planners (notably Raymond Unwin and Frank Mears), the Indian social scientist Radhakamal Mukerjee and the Catalan architect Cebrià de Montoliu (1873–1923) as well as many other 20th-century thinkers.

Geddes was keenly interested in the science of ecology, an advocate of nature conservation and strongly opposed to environmental pollution. Because of this, some historians have claimed he was a forerunner of modern Green politics.

In August 1982, during the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh College of Art mounted an exhibition entitled &quot;On the Side of Life: Patrick Geddes 1854 - 1932&quot;, designed by John L. Paterson.

In 2000, a Patrick Geddes Heritage Trail was created on Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile by the Patrick Geddes Memorial Trust.

Researchers at the Geddes Institute for Urban Research at the University of Dundee continue to develop Geddesian approaches to questions of city and regional planning and questions of social and psychical well-being in the built environment. In late 2015 the University staged an exhibition of Geddes&#x27; work in the Lamb Gallery, drawn from the Archives of the Universities of Dundee, Strathclyde, and Edinburgh, to mark the centenary of the publication of &quot;Cities in Evolution&quot;.

In 2008, the Scottish Historic Building Trust (SHBT) was approached to imagine a future for Riddle&#x27;s Court in Edinburgh&#x27;s Lawnmarket, which Geddes had restored for use as a university hall of residence in 1890. Between 2015 and 2017, the Trust undertook a major conservation and regeneration project at the building to create a venue for conferences, meetings and weddings. Riddle&#x27;s Court now houses the Patrick Geddes Centre for Learning, an educational arm of SHBT.

<doc id="512242" wikidata="Q7441770" url="?curid=512242" title="Searoad Ferries">
<text>Searoad Ferries (formerly known as Peninsula Searoad Transport) is an Australian company that operates a roll-on/roll-off vehicle and passenger ferry service between the heads of Port Phillip, near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

The route operates between terminals at Queenscliff on the Bellarine Peninsula and Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula. It is serviced by two ships, currently the MV &quot;Queenscliff&quot; and the MV &quot;Sorrento&quot;. Dolphins are often seen following the ferries during their crossing.

The ferry service runs every hour during the day, and makes a crossing in approximately 40 minutes (plus an additional 40 minute check in time for vehicles and 20 minutes for passengers). The alternative drive from Queenscliff to Sorrento via road is approximately three hours during non-peak traffic conditions.

==History==
Three sea pilots, Paul Ringe, Keith Finnemore and Maurie Cobal founded Peninsula Searoad Transport Pty Ltd (PST) in 1983. They believed that a vehicular ferry should run between Queenscliff and Sorrento. There were mixed opinions about this from the public. Some people thought that the novelty would wear off and then business would fail. However, the various tourism boards in Victoria were excited about the prospect of having a vehicular ferry, linking the two peninsulas and would also create tourism jobs.

===Peninsula Princess===
After various planning, on 19 June 1987 the &quot;Peninsula Princess&quot; was launched in Carrington, New South Wales. She underwent sea trials before moving to Port Phillip Bay. Her crew boarded her in Geelong, Victoria to get a feel for the vessel. She had to wait there for the Queenscliff berth to be completed.

The first sailing was intended to be on 7 September 1987, but the berths specially designed for this vessel at Queenscliff and Sorrento were not yet complete.

On 13 September 1987, she entered service. On the first arrival at Sorrento, the skipper encountered a problem with the ahead/astern controls. She hit the concrete wharf and whilst tyres around the wharf buffered the impact there was still considerable damage done to the transom. Commercial operations started on the weekend commencing 19 September 1987.

A few weeks later, during low tide at Queenscliff the crew encountered problems because of the depth of the water and the strong winds. As one of the deckhands attempted to take control by winching the boat in to its berth, the rope slipped and jumped and he was thrown to the deck. By the time he attempted to regain his footing the &quot;Peninsula Princess&quot; had been taken hold of by the wind. She was thrown against the edge of the creek and broke a propeller and had a bent shaft. The ferry had to be dry docked for repairs. The business had financial issues and could not afford for this to happen again.

After the new ferry was introduced, the &quot;Peninsula Princess&quot; was frequently docked at the former Queenscliff ferry berth. In 2004 the ferry was sighted docked in the Tamar River in Launceston, Tasmania.

===MV &quot;Queenscliff&quot;===
By the early 1990s, traffic using the ferry had increased, and an increase in capacity was required to cope. A new and much larger ferry, the MV &quot;Queenscliff&quot; was purchased, and work commenced on the ferry berths to enable them to handle the new ferry. At Sorrento the existing berth was altered, while at Queenscliff a new berth was built to the south.

These works were not without controversy, and Peninsula Searoad Transport was required to attend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to resolve the issues. The new ferry cost $5 million, and was put into service on 22 December 1993.

On 12 October 2005, the Australian Defence Force staged an anti-terrorism exercise on the MV &quot;Queenscliff&quot;. Two Black Hawk helicopters were used to fast rope members of the Tactical Assault Group onto the roof of the ferry, and members of the Boat Assault Force boarded the ferry from inflatable dinghies.

===MV &quot;Sorrento&quot;===

Traffic using the ferry service continued to grow though the 1990s, carrying about 110,000 cars/trucks/coaches/motorcycles and 600,000 passengers each year. As a result, in 2000 it was decided to purchase a second ferry, enabling a doubling in the service frequency.

The &quot;MV Sorrento&quot; was built in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia at a cost of $12 million, and was similar in size and appearance to the existing ferry. Minor differences between the two include an elevator from the car deck to the top deck, a new lounge at the front called the &#x27;Portsea Lounge&#x27;, and the number of exterior windows at the top would be in groups of three, not in fours.

The increased frequency resulted in the closure of the Queenscliff - Portsea - Sorrento passenger ferry service in the early 2000s.

<text>Lakshmi Niwas Mittal (; born 15 June 1950 in Sadulpur, Rajasthan, India) is an Indian steel magnate, based in the United Kingdom. He is the executive chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world&#x27;s second largest steelmaking company, as well as chairman of stainless steel manufacturer Aperam. Mittal owns 38% of ArcelorMittal and holds a 3% stake in EFL Championship side Queens Park Rangers.

In 2005, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Mittal as the third-richest person in the world, making him the first Indian citizen to be ranked in the top ten in the publication&#x27;s annual list of the world&#x27;s richest people. He was ranked the sixth-richest person in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2011, but dropped to 82nd place in March 2015, and only to 130th by October 2024. He is also the &quot;57th-most powerful person&quot; of the 72 individuals named in &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; &quot;Most Powerful People&quot; list for 2015. His daughter Vanisha Mittal&#x27;s wedding (in 2005) was the second-most expensive in recorded history.

Mittal has been a member of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs since 2008. He sits on the World Steel Association&#x27;s executive committee, and is a member of the Global CEO Council of the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Foreign Investment Council in Kazakhstan, the World Economic Forum&#x27;s International Business Council, and the European Round Table of Industrialists. He is also a member of the board of trustees of the Cleveland Clinic.

In 2005, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; named him &quot;Business Person of 2006&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; named him &quot;Person of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him &quot;International Newsmaker of the Year 2006&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included him in their &quot;Time 100&quot; list.

==Early life and career==
Mittal was born in a Marwari Hindu family. He studied at Shri Daulatram Nopany Vidyalaya, Calcutta from 1957 to 1964. He graduated from St. Xavier&#x27;s College, affiliated to the University of Calcutta, with a B.Com degree in the first class.

Lakshmi&#x27;s father, Mohanlal Mittal, ran a steel business, Nippon Denro Ispat. In 1976, because of the curb of steel production by the Indian government, the 26-year-old Mittal opened his first steel factory PT Ispat Indo in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia.

In 1989 Mittal purchased the state-owned steel works in Trinidad and Tobago, which were operating at an enormous loss. He turned them into profitable ventures in a year.

Until the 1990s, the family&#x27;s main assets in India were a cold-rolling mill for sheet steels in Nagpur and an alloy steels plant near Pune. Today, the family business, including a large integrated steel plant near Mumbai, is run by his younger brothers Pramod Mittal and Vinod Mittal, but Lakshmi has no connection with it.

In 1995 Mittal purchased the Irish Steel plant based in Cork, Ireland, from the government for a nominal fee of IR£1. Only six years later in 2001 it was closed, leaving over 400 people redundant. Subsequent environmental issues at the site have been a cause for criticism. The Irish government sought a High Court judgement that Mittal&#x27;s company should contribute to the cost of the clean-up of Cork Harbour, but failed. The clean up was expected to cost €70 million.

Prior to December 2001, Mittal had acquired assets which he renamed Ispat Mexicana and his Kazakhstani operation Ispat Karmet. That month he renamed Sidex Galati to Ispat Sidex, which he had acquired in November 2001.

In October 2003, the LNM Group succeeded in concluding the $155 million transaction to pry loose the Romanian government from the control of steel assets Siderurgica Hunedoara and Petrotub Roman, the day after it took over the PHS Steel Group which include Huta Sendzimira, Huta Katowice, Huta Florian and Huta Cedler from the Polish government.

Petrotub Roman was renamed Ispat Tepro in the sequel.

Mittal successfully employed Marek Dochnal&#x27;s consultancy to influence Polish officials in the 2003 privatisation of PHS steel group, which was then Poland&#x27;s largest. Dochnal was later arrested for bribing Polish officials on behalf of Russian agents in a separate affair.

Employees of Mittal have accused him of allowing &quot;slave labour&quot; conditions after multiple fatalities in his mines. For example, during December 2004, 23 miners died in explosions in his mines in Kazakhstan caused by faulty gas detectors.

In 2006–07, Mittal succeeded in a hostile takeover bid for Arcelor, which he renamed Arcelor Mittal. In so doing he obtained control of amongst others the Usinor steel assets of France, the Arbed steel assets of Luxembourg, and the Aceralia steel assets of Spain.

==Controversies==
===The Mittal Affair: &quot;Cash for Influence&quot;===
In 2002, Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price obtained a letter written by Tony Blair to the Romanian Government in support of Mittal&#x27;s LNM Group steel company, which was in the process of bidding to buy Romania&#x27;s state-owned industry. This revelation caused controversy, because Mittal had given £125,000 to the British Labour Party the previous year. Although Blair defended his letter as simply &quot;celebrating the success&quot; of a British company, he was criticised because LNM was registered in the Dutch Antilles and employed less than 1% of its workforce in the UK. LNM was a &quot;major global competitor of Britain&#x27;s own struggling steel industry&quot;.

Blair&#x27;s letter hinted that the privatisation of the firm and sale to Mittal might help smooth the way for Romania&#x27;s entry into the European Union. It also had a passage, removed just prior to Blair&#x27;s signing of it, describing Mittal as &quot;a friend&quot;.

In October 2003, the LNM Group succeeded in concluding the transaction to pry loose the Romanian government from the control of steel assets.

==Social work==

===Sports===
After witnessing India win only one medal, bronze, in the 2000 Summer Olympics, and one medal, silver, at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Mittal decided to set up the Mittal Champions Trust with $9 million to support ten Indian athletes with world-beating potential. In 2008, Mittal awarded Abhinav Bindra with Rs. 1.5 Crore (Rs. 15 million), for getting India its first individual Olympic gold medal in shooting. ArcelorMittal also provided steel for the construction of the ArcelorMittal Orbit for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

For Comic Relief he matched the money raised (~£1 million) on the celebrity special BBC programme, &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

Mittal had emerged as a leading contender to buy and sell Barclays Premiership clubs Wigan and Everton. However, on 20 December 2007, it was announced that the Mittal family had purchased a 20 per cent shareholding in Queens Park Rangers football club joining Flavio Briatore and Mittal&#x27;s friend Bernie Ecclestone. As part of the investment Mittal&#x27;s son-in-law, Amit Bhatia, took a place on the board of directors. The combined investment in the struggling club sparked suggestions that Mittal might be looking to join the growing ranks of wealthy individuals investing heavily in English football and emulating similar benefactors such as Roman Abramovich. On 19 February 2010, Briatore resigned as QPR chairman, and sold further shares in the club to Ecclestone, making Ecclestone the single largest shareholder.

===Education===
In 2003, the Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, Usha Mittal Foundation and the Government of Rajasthan partnered together to establish a university, the LNM Institute of Information Technology (LNMIIT) in Jaipur as an autonomous non-profit organisation.

In 2009, the Foundation along with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan founded the Usha Lakshmi Mittal Institute of Management in New Delhi.

SNDT Women&#x27;s University renamed the Institute of Technology for Women (ITW) as Usha Mittal Institute of Technology after a large donation from the Lakshmi Niwas Mittal Foundation.

He completed his primary and secondary school from Nopany High formerly known as Shri Daulatram Nopany Vidyalaya.

===Medical===
In 2008, the Mittals made a donation of £15 million to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, the largest private contribution the hospital had ever received. The donation was used to help fund their new facility, the Mittal Children&#x27;s Medical Centre.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
He made a donation of ₹100 crores to PM cares fund during the COVID-19 pandemic in India in 2020.

==Personal life==

Mittal is married to Usha Dalmia. They have a son Aditya Mittal and a daughter Vanisha Mittal.

Lakshmi Mittal has two brothers, Pramod Mittal and Vinod Mittal, and a sister, Seema Lohia, who married Indonesian businessman, Sri Prakash Lohia. His residence at 18–19 Kensington Palace Gardens—which was purchased from Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2004 for £67 million (US$128 million)—made it the world&#x27;s most expensive house at the time. The house is decorated with marble taken from the same quarry that supplied the Taj Mahal. The extravagant show of wealth has been referred to as the &quot;Taj Mittal&quot;. It has 12 bedrooms, an indoor pool, Turkish baths and parking for 20 cars. He is a lacto-vegetarian.

Mittal bought No. 9A Palace Greens, Kensington Gardens, formerly the Philippines Embassy, for £70 million in 2008 for his daughter Vanisha Mittal who is married to Amit Bhatia, a businessman and philanthropist. Mittal threw a lavish &quot;vegetarian reception&quot; for Vanisha in the Palace of Versailles, France.

In 2005, he also bought a colonial bungalow for $30 million at No. 22, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road, New Delhi, one of the most exclusive streets in India, occupied by embassies and billionaires, and rebuilt it as a house.

===Personal wealth===
According to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2016&quot;, Mittal and his family had an estimated personal net worth of 7.12 billion, a decrease of $2.08 billion on the previous year. Meanwhile, in 2016 &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual billionaires list assessed estimated Mittal&#x27;s wealth in 2016 at as the 135th-wealthiest billionaire with a net worth of 8.4 billion. Mittal&#x27;s net worth peaked in 2008, assessed by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; at £27.70 billion, and by &quot;Forbes&quot; at 45.0 billion, and rated as the fourth-wealthiest individual in the world. As of 2022, he was ranked as the 15th richest man in India by &quot;Forbes&quot; with a net-worth of US$17.8 billion. According to Forbes, Lakshmi Mittal’s net worth is currently estimated at US$16.4 billion as of 2024. He holds the position of the 113th richest individual globally and ranks as the 13th wealthiest person in India.

In October 2024, Mittal was ranked 15th on Forbes list of India’s 100 richest tycoons, with a net worth of $16.7 billion.

<text>Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko (; ; 9 March 1814 – 10 March 1861) was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, folklorist and ethnographer. He was a fellow of the Imperial Academy of Arts and a member of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius. He wrote poetry in Ukrainian and prose (nine novellas, a diary, and his autobiography) in Russian.

His literary heritage, in particular the poetry collection &quot;Kobzar&quot;, is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and to some degree, the modern Ukrainian language.

==Life==
===Childhood and youth===

Taras Shevchenko was born on in the village of Moryntsi, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire, about 20 years after the third partition of Poland wherein the territory of Ukraine where Shevchenko was born was annexed by Imperial Russia. He was the third child after his sister Kateryna and brother Mykyta; his younger siblings were a brother, Yosyp, and a sister, Maria, who was born blind. His parents were Kateryna Shevchenko (née Boiko) and Hryhoriy Ivanovych Shevchenko, former subjects of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth who became serf peasants, working the land owned by , a nephew of the Russian statesman Grigory Potemkin.

In 1816, the family moved to Kyrylivka (modern ), another village owned by Engelhardt, where Taras&#x27;s father and grandfather had been born. The boy grew up in the village. Once, he went looking for &quot;the pillars that prop up the sky&quot; and got lost. Chumaks (travelling merchants) who met the boy took him back to the village. From 1822, Shevchenko was sent to a school, where he was taught to read and write. His teacher was the precentor of the village church, whose nickname was &quot;Sovhyr&quot;. He was a harsh disciplinarian, who had a tradition of birching the children in his class every Saturday. 

On Kateryna Shevchenko died. The widowed Hryhoriy, left to look after six children aged from thirteen to four, had little choice but to remarry. He was married to Oksana Tereshchenko, a widow from Moryntsi, who had three children of her own. 

When Hryhoriy Shevchenko became a chumak, Taras travelled twice with his father and his older brother away from his neighbourhood and, for the first time in his life, on to the open steppe. Hryhoriy died from a chill on , and for a period the children&#x27;s stepmother ruled the family, treating Taras and those siblings still at the family home with great cruelty, until she was expelled by their grandfather, Ivan Shevchenko. For a period Taras lived with his grandfather and his father&#x27;s brother Pavlo, and was made to work as a swineherd and a groom&#x27;s assistant. At the age of 12, he left home to work as a student assistant and a servant for a drunkard named Bohorsky, who had replaced Sovhyr as the village precentor and teacher and was even more violent than his predecessor. One of Shevenko&#x27;s duties was to read psalms over the dead. He was treated still more violently by Bohorsky once the boy&#x27;s stepmother became his mistress.

In February 1827, the 13-year-old Shevchenko escaped from the village and worked for a few days for a deacon in Lysianka, before moving on to Tarasivka. Frustrated in his attempts to become an artist, he returned to his home village. At around this time, Shevchenko experienced his first love, , as confirmed by a dedication he later wrote in the poem &quot;&quot;:

There is evidence that during this period of his life, Shevchenko was trained by his older brother Mykola to become a wheelwright, and that he also lived with and worked for the family of Hryhoriy Koshytsia, the Kyrylivka priest, who treated Taras well. His duties included driving the priest&#x27;s son to school, and transporting fruit to markets in Burty and Shpola.

===Life as a servant of Pavel Engelhardt===

In 1828, Engelhardt died, and one of his sons, , became the Shevchenko family&#x27;s new landlord. Taras Shevchenko, then aged 14, was trained to become a kitchen servant and the (court servant) of his new master at the Vilshana estates. There he saw for the first time the luxuries of the Russian nobility.

In 1829, Shevchenko was part of Engelhardt&#x27;s retinue that travelled to Warsaw, where his regiment was based. By the end of 1829 they had reached Vilno (modern Vilnius). On , Engelhardt caught Shevchenko at night painting a portrait of the Cossack general Matvei Platov. He boxed the boy&#x27;s ears and ordered him to be whipped. When the party reached Warsaw, Engelhardt arranged for his servant to be apprenticed to a painter-decorator, who, recognising the boy&#x27;s artistic talents, recommended he receive lessons from the Polish painter and professional artist, Franciszek Ksawery Lampi. 

When the November Uprising broke out in 1830, Engelhardt and his regiment were forced to leave Warsaw. His servants, including Shevchenko, were later expelled from the city, forced to leave Polish territory under armed guard, and then made their way to St. Petersburg. Upon arriving there, Shevchenko returned to the life of being a page-boy. His artistic training was delayed for a year, after which he was permitted to study for four years with the painter , a man who proved to be much more cruel and controlling than his master in Warsaw. The summer nights were light enough for Shevchenko to visit the city&#x27;s Summer Garden, where he drew the statues. 
In his novel &quot;Artist&quot;, Shevchenko described that during the pre-academical period he painted such works as &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot;, &quot;Fraklete&quot;, &quot;Heraclitus&quot;, &quot;Architectural barelief&quot;, and &quot;Mask of Fortune.&quot; He participated in the painting of the Bolshoi Theatre as an apprentice. The composition &quot;Alexander of Macedon shows trust towards his doctor Philip&quot; was created for a contest of the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1830.

===Liberation from serfdom===

During one of his copying sessions in the city&#x27;s Summer Gardens, Shevchenko made the acquaintance of a young Ukrainian artist, Ivan Soshenko, a painter and a student of the Imperial Academy of Arts, who came from Bohuslav, close to Shevchenko&#x27;s home village. Soshenko showed in an interest in Shevchenko&#x27;s drawings, and recognised the young man&#x27;s talent. He was allowed to receive drawing and watercolour painting lessons from Soshenko on weekends, and when he had spare time during the week. Shevchenko made such progress as a portraitist that Engelhardt asked him to portray several of his mistresses. 

Soshenko took Shevchenko to Saint Petersburg&#x27;s art galleries, including the Hermitage. He introduced him to other compatriots, such as the writer and poet Yevhen Hrebinka, the art historian , and the Russian painter Alexey Venetsianov. Through these men, around June 1832, Shevchenko was introduced to the most fashionable painter of the day, the artist Karl Briullov. Briullov took an interest in Shevchenko, praising his work and indicating a willingness to take him on as a student. However, as a serf, Shevchenko was ineligible to study under Briullov at the Academy, who requested his freedom from Engelhardt. The request was met with a refusal, which enraged Briullov. 

Engelhardt was persuaded to release his servant on condition that a fee of 2500 rubles was paid. To raise this sum, Briullov painted a portrait of the Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky as a lottery prize for the imperial family; the winning lottery ticket was drawn by the tsarina. Engelhardt signed the paperwork that released Shevchenko from serfdom on .

===Initial success (1838–1846)===

====Paintings and drawings====
After he became a student of the Imperial Academy of Arts, with Briullov as his mentor, Shevchenko spent most of his time at the academy and in Briullov&#x27;s studio. Together they attended literary and musical evenings, and visited writers and artists. Shevchenko&#x27;s social life enriched and expanded his horizons and stimulated his creativity. His friends during this period included , a writer and officer of the Black Sea Cossack Host who was to become his friend for life, and the artist ,

From June to November 1838, Shevchenko&#x27;s examination marks improved enough to allow him to join a compositional drawings class. An early drawing from this class, &quot;&quot;, was completed in December that year. The following month his work was recognised by the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, who agreed to pay him a monthly maintenance fee of 30 rubles a month.

In April 1839, Shevchenko was awarded a silver medal by the Council of the Academy. He began to master the technique of oil painting, with &#x27; being among his earliest attempts. From November, he became seriously ill with typhus. That year, he received another silver medal, this time for his oil painting &quot;The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog&quot;. In September 1841, the Academy of Arts awarded Shevchenko his third silver medal, for the painting &#x27;. The following May, continual absenteeism from classes forced the Society for the Encouragement of Artists to exclude him from among its free boarders. To earn an income he produced book illustrations, such as for Nikolai Nadezhdin&#x27;s story &quot;The Power of Will&quot;, &#x27;s publication &quot;Ours, written off from nature by the Russians&quot;, an edition of Wolfgang Franz von Kobell&#x27;s &quot;Galvanography&quot; (1843), and a book by Nikolai Polevoy, &quot;Russian Generals&quot; (1845).

====Poetry====

At the end of 1839, Shevchenko met the sculptor and art teacher Ivan Martos, who showed great interest in his poems. He offered to publish them, but Shevchenko did not immediately agree. Hrebinka took an active and direct part in the publication of &quot;Kobzar&quot; (1840); it was he who submitted the manuscript to the . &quot;Kobzar&quot; sold out. It did not openly call for revolutionary actions, but it expressed a protest against social injustice and a desire for a free life. 

In March 1840, Hrebinka submitted the manuscript of the almanac &quot;Lastivka&quot; to the censors, which also included Shevchenko&#x27;s &quot;Prychynna&quot; and the poems &quot; and &quot;. 
In 1841, Shevchenko paid for his epic poem &quot;Haidamaky&quot;. The poem was met with sharp criticism by the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky; in the magazine &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; he criticized Shevchenko&#x27;s &quot;inclination to romantic pompous ingenuity&quot;. Other poems produced by Shevchenko during this period include &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

While residing in Saint Petersburg, Shevchenko made three trips to Ukraine: in 1843, 1845, and 1846. The difficult conditions Ukrainians endured had a profound impact on the poet-painter. Shevchenko visited his siblings, still enserfed, and other relatives. He met with prominent Ukrainian writers and intellectuals Yevhen Hrebinka, Panteleimon Kulish, and Mykhaylo Maksymovych, and was befriended by the princely Repnin family, especially Varvara.

In 1844, distressed by the condition of Ukrainian regions in the Russian Empire, Shevchenko decided to capture some of his homeland&#x27;s historical ruins and cultural monuments in an album of etchings, which he called &quot;Picturesque Ukraine&quot;. Only the first six etchings were printed because of the lack of means to continue. An album of watercolors from historical places and pencil drawings was compiled in 1845.

====Plays====
Shevchenko&#x27;s play &quot;Blind Beauty&quot;, written , has not survived. In 1842, he released a part of the tragedy and, in 1843 he completed the drama &quot;&quot;.

In the autumn of 1842, Shevchenko planned a sea trip to Sweden and Denmark, but due to illness, he returned home after reaching Revel (modern Tallinn).

===First trip to Ukraine===

In May 1843, Shevchenko travelled to Ukraine, where he met as many intellectuals, poets, and artists as possible, including the future Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius member Vasyl Bilozersky. During his stay in Kyiv, Shevchenko sketched the city&#x27;s historical sights and landscapes. After a month he went to Yahotyn, where he befriended the wealthy Repnin family. In October 1843, he wrote his poem &quot;&quot;, after visiting recent excavations of burial mounds that many Ukrainians considered to be symbolic of the heroic past of the Cossacks.

Shevchenko planned to publish an album, &quot;Picturesque Ukraine&quot;, to consist of his annotated etchings of places and events connected with Ukraine and its past, and use the proceeds to buy his family their freedom. The Society for the Encouragement of Artists gave him 300 rubles to help produce &quot;Picturesque Ukraine&quot;, but due to his poor planning and lack of business skills, few of the intended etchings with their accompanying text were published, and not enough money was generated from sales to fulfill his dream of buying his siblings&#x27; freedom.

===Exile===
On 22 March 1845, the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title of a non-classed artist. He again traveled to Ukraine where he met with historian Mykola Kostomarov and other members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, a clandestine society also known as &quot;Ukrainian-Slavic society&quot; and dedicated to the political liberalization of the Empire and its transformation into a federation-like polity of Slavic nations.

In 1844, Shevchenko wrote the poem &quot;&quot; that described the social and national oppression of the Ukrainians by the Russian upper classes. In February, he arrived back in Saint Petersburg from Ukraine. Copies of the poem were confiscated from the society&#x27;s members and became one of the major issues of the scandal.

Shevchenko was arrested together with the members of the society on 5 April 1847. Tsar Nicholas I read Shevchenko&#x27;s poem, &quot;Dream&quot;. Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy appearance and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist uprising and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated &quot;I suppose he had reasons not to be on terms with me, but what has she done to deserve this?&quot; 
In the official report of Orlov Shevchenko was accused of composing poetry in &quot;Little-Russian language&quot; (an archaic Russian name for the Ukrainian language) of outrageous content, instead of being grateful to be redeemed out of serfdom. In the report, Orlov listed the crimes as advocating and inspiring Ukrainian nationalists, alleging enslavement and misfortune of Ukraine, glorifying the Hetman Administration (Cossack Hetmanate) and Cossack liberties and that he &quot;with incredible audacity poured slander and bile on persons of Imperial House&quot;.

While under investigation, Shevchenko was imprisoned in Saint Petersburg in casemates of the 3rd Department of Imperial Chancellery on Panteleimonovskaya Street (today Pestelia str., 9). After being convicted, he was exiled as a private to the Russian military garrison in Orenburg at Orsk, near the Ural Mountains. Tsar Nicholas I personally confirmed his sentence, added to it, &quot;Under the strictest surveillance, without the right to write or paint.&quot; He was subsequently sent on a forced march from Saint Petersburg to Orenburg and Orsk.

The following year, 1848, he was assigned to undertake the first Russian naval expedition of the Aral Sea on the ship &quot;Konstantin&quot;, under the command of Lieutenant Butakov. Although officially a common private, Shevchenko was effectively treated as an equal by the other members of the expedition. He was tasked to sketch various landscapes around the coast of the Aral Sea. After an 18-month voyage (1848–49), Shevchenko returned with his album of drawings and paintings to Orenburg. Most of those drawings were created for a detailed account of the expedition. Nevertheless, he created many unique works of art about the Aral Sea nature and Kazakhstan people at a time when Russian conquest of Central Asia had begun in the middle of the nineteenth century.
He was then sent to one of the worst penal settlements, the remote fortress of Novopetrovsk at Mangyshlak Peninsula, where he spent seven terrible years. In 1851, at the suggestion of fellow serviceman Bronisław Zaleski, lieutenant colonel Mayevsky assigned him to the Mangyshlak (Karatau) geological expedition. In 1857, Shevchenko finally returned from exile after receiving amnesty from a new emperor, though he was not permitted to return to St. Petersburg and was forced to stay in Nizhniy Novgorod.

Shevchenko was eventually allowed to return to St. Petersburg. In the winter of 1858, he saw African-American Shakespearean actor Ira Aldridge perform with his troupe. Using translators, the two became good friends over discussions of art and music and their shared experiences of oppression. Shevchenko drew Aldridge&#x27;s portrait. Aldridge was later gifted a portrait of Shevchenko by Mikhail Mikeshin.

In May 1859, Shevchenko got permission to return to Ukraine. He intended to buy a plot of land close to the village of Pekari. In July, he was again arrested on a charge of blasphemy, but then released and ordered to return to St. Petersburg.
===Death===
Taras Shevchenko spent the last years of his life working on new poetry, paintings, and engravings, as well as editing his older works. He also created and financed the publication of a . After difficult years in exile, however, illnesses took their toll upon him. Shevchenko died in Saint Petersburg on 10 March 1861, the day after his 47th birthday.

He was first buried at the Smolensk Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. His funeral in Saint Petersburg was attended by such greats of Russian literature as Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Saltykov-Shchedrin and Leskov. However, fulfilling Shevchenko&#x27;s wish, expressed in his poem &quot;Testament&quot; (&quot;Zapovit&quot;), to be buried in Ukraine, his friends arranged the transfer of his remains by train to Moscow and then by horse-drawn wagon to his homeland. Shevchenko was re-buried on 8 May on the &quot;Chernecha hora&quot; (Monk&#x27;s Hill; today Taras Hill) near the Dnipro River in Kaniv. A tall mound was erected over his grave, now a memorial part of the Kaniv Museum-Preserve.

Dogged by terrible misfortune in love and life, the poet died seven days before the 1861 emancipation of serfs was announced. His works and life are revered by Ukrainians throughout the world and his impact on Ukrainian literature is immense.

==Poetic works==
237 poems were written by Shevchenko but only 28 of these were published in the Russian Empire. Six others were published in the Austrian Empire over his lifetime.

===Example of poetry: &quot;Testament&quot; (&quot;Zapovit&quot;)===
Shevchenko&#x27;s 1845 &quot;Testament&quot; (&quot;Zapovit&quot;) has been translated into more than 150 languages and set to music in the 1870s by H. Hladky.

&lt;/poem&gt;


==Political, philosophical and aesthetic views==

Shevchenko is considered to be &quot;the founder of the revolutionary democratic trend in the history of Ukrainian social thought&quot; and a utopian socialist. His political, aesthetic and philosophical worldview was formed under the influence of the ideas of Russian revolutionary democrats such as Herzen, Belinsky, Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky; his views reflected the interests of the Ukrainian peasantry of the mid-19th century, the era of the crisis of the feudal-serf system in Imperial Russia. Shevchenko was also strongly influenced by ideas of the Polish revolutionary movement contained in the works of authors such as Adam Mickiewicz. Critical of the historical Polish attitude to Ukrainians in his early poems, later in his life Shevchenko started calling his compatriots for solidarity with Poles in their fight against the Tsarist regime.

While he tirelessly exposed the oppression of the Russian landowners and the Tsar, Shevchenko also shared pan-Slavist views and maintained contacts with Russian intelligentsia. His attitude can be demonstrated by his views of 17th-century Ukrainian Cossack leader Bohdan Khmelnitsky, whom he praised as the &quot;glorious of the glorious&quot;, but simultaneously criticized for paving the way for the liquidation of Ukrainian autonomy by Moscow. Shevchenko advocated for the unification of the Slavic peoples on a democratic basis. 

A serf peasant, ransomed from captivity, Shevchenko was in the words of Russian critic Nikolai Dobrolyubov, &quot;a poet of the people ... He came out of the people, lived with the people, and not only by thought, but by the circumstances of life, was closely and bloodily connected with the people.&quot; 

Shevchenko was one of the most active participants in a secret political organization in Ukraine, the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius and headed the revolutionary nucleus in it. He was associated with a group of Petrashevists (the Petrashevsky Circle was a Russian literary discussion group of progressive-minded intellectuals in St. Petersburg in the 1840s, which also included a young Fyodor Dostoyevsky and radical utopian socialists) who, in their plans for a peasant uprising, hoped to use his revolutionary activities in Ukraine. After his exile, Shevchenko became close to the members of the &quot;Sovremennik&quot; literary, social and political magazine and its editors, Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Nikolai Dobrolyubov.

Shevchenko did not consider the existing social system to be unshakable, he was convinced that the serf system would be destroyed everywhere due to the development of the steam engine, a technique that would &quot;devour the landlord-inquisitors&quot;, and that the most important role in a radical change in social life would be played by the masses. Although he argued that the strength of the spirit cannot manifest itself without matter, he did not call his philosophical position &quot;materialism&quot;, understanding by this word the vulgar materialism of contemporary thinkers such as Büchner, Moleschott and Vogt, which he rejected. In his poem, &quot;The Heretic&quot;, Shevchenko praised the struggle of Jan Hus (an early 15th-century Bohemian religious reformer) for the interests of ordinary people and the unity of the Slavs.

According to Shevchenko&#x27;s aesthetic views, which the poet expressed in his &quot;Diary&quot;, the source of beauty is nature; any attempts to deviate from the eternal beauty of nature make the artist &quot;a moral monster&quot;. Shevchenko strove for art that is both national (folkloric) and realistic, and for that he earned the praise of Chernyshevsky and the Russian itinerant painter Ivan Kramskoi, who drew the poet&#x27;s famous portrait after his death.

In the 1840s and then in the 1850s, in the era of the political struggle within the Empire&#x27;s intelligentsia between the revolutionary-minded radical wing and the more moderate liberal wing, Shevchenko stood on the side of the Russian revolutionary democrats. His battle poetry, which spread underground, was a sharp weapon in the fight against serfdom. Shevchenko had a great influence on the further development of revolutionary social thought in Ukraine and on Ukrainian culture in general (Ivan Franko, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Lesya Ukrainka, etc.).

==Artwork==
Of Shevchenko&#x27;s known paintings and drawings, generally related to Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan, 835 works have survived as original works or as prints or copies made during his lifetime; 270 other works are lost. Shevchenko produced portraits, compositions on mythological, historical, and household themes, architectural drawings, and landscapes, using oils on canvas, watercolour, sepia, ink, and pencil, as well as etchings. Sketches and studies are known, which are of use in understanding Shevchenko&#x27;s artistic style and methods. Few of his works are signed and even fewer are dated.

==Heritage and legacy==
A great number of his pictures, drawings, and etchings preserved to this day testify to his unique artistic talent. He also experimented with photography and it is little known that Shevchenko may be considered to have pioneered the art of etching in the Russian Empire (in 1860 he was awarded the title of Academician in the Imperial Academy of Arts specifically for his achievements in etching.)
He inspired some of the protesters during the Euromaidan. The context of his poem &quot;Testament&quot; (Zapovit) was given credit for &quot;resonating&quot; with Ukraine&#x27;s ongoing struggle during the invasion from Russia in 2022.

===Monuments and memorials===

The first statue of Shevchenko, unveiled in Romny in October 1918, was constructed in the waning days of the Hetmanate, but many such statues were built in the Soviet Union. Statues erected in Moscow in November 1918 and Petrograd in December 1918 were later demolished because they were made from inferior materials, and needed to be rebuilt. The monument erected in his name in Saint Petersburg was remade in 2000. There are monuments to Shevchenko throughout Ukraine, such as at his memorials in Kaniv, in the centre of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, and Luhansk. After Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union, some statues of Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine were replaced by statues of Shevchenko.

Monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in other countries. These include the granite Taras Shevchenko Memorial in Washington, D.C., a monument in Rome, Italy (next to the Basilica of St. Sophia), a monument in Soyuzivka, New York, statues in the Brazilian cities of Curitiba and Prudentópolis, and in the Croatian capital Zagreb. A bust of Shevchenko was unveiled at Shevchenko School in Vita, Manitoba, Canada in 1987 and another on 24 September 2010 in the Østre Anlæg Park in Copenhagen.

===Other commemorations===
In 1957, the Ukrainian-American composer wrote the cantata &quot;Poslaniie&quot;, based on Shevchenko&#x27;s poem of the same name.

From 1966 to 1968 artist Hanna Veres made a series of ornamental textiles that she dedicated to Shevchenko. They were used to illustrate the 1971 edition of &quot;Kobzar&quot;.

<text>The 6th Golden Raspberry Awards were held on March 23, 1986, at the Morgan-Wixon Theatre in Santa Monica, California, to recognize the worst the movie industry had to offer in 1985. Though &quot;&quot; won Worst Picture, &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (also starring Sylvester Stallone) received the greatest number of nominations (9) and &quot;wins&quot; (5). This is the only year in which one movie won worst picture and another movie had the most nominations and wins.

Godzilla, nominated for Worst New Star (as &quot;The New Computerized Godzilla&quot;) was the first fictional character to be nominated without mentioning or referencing the actor who plays him.

<doc id="512246" wikidata="Q747652" url="?curid=512246" title="Pinus wallichiana">
<text>Pinus wallichiana is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountains, from eastern Afghanistan east across northern Pakistan and north west India to Yunnan in southwest China. It grows in mountain valleys at altitudes of 1800–4300 m (rarely as low as 1200 m), reaching in height. It favours a temperate climate with dry winters and wet summers. In Pashto, it is known as &quot;Nishtar&quot;.

This tree is often known as Bhutan pine, (not to be confused with the recently described Bhutan white pine, &quot;Pinus bhutanica&quot;, a closely related species). Other names include blue pine, Himalayan pine and Himalayan white pine.

==Description==
The leaves (&quot;needles&quot;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five and are 12–18 cm long. They are noted for being flexible along their length, and often droop gracefully. The cones are long and slender, 16–32 cm, yellow-buff when mature, with thin scales; the seeds are 5–6 mm long with a 20–30 mm wing.

Typical habitats are mountain screes and glacier forelands, but it will also form old-growth forests as the primary species or in mixed forests with deodar, birch, spruce, and fir. In some places it reaches the tree line.

&quot;P. wallichiana&quot; is the primary host for Himalayan dwarf mistletoe.

==Uses==
The wood is moderately hard, durable and highly resinous. It is a good firewood but gives off a pungent resinous smoke. It is a commercial source of turpentine which is superior quality than that of &quot;P. roxburghii&quot; but is not produced so freely.

The tree became available through the European nursery trade in 1836, nine years after the Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich first introduced seeds to England. It is a popular tree for planting in parks and large gardens, grown for its attractive foliage and large, decorative cones. It is also valued for its relatively high resistance to air pollution, tolerating this better than some other conifers.

This plant and its slow-growing cultivar &#x27;Nana&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="512247" wikidata="Q740832" url="?curid=512247" title="Jezkazgan">
<text>Zhezkazgan, or Jezkazgan ( ) is a city and the administrative centre of Ulytau Region, Kazakhstan. Population: Its urban area includes the neighbouring mining town of Satpayev, for a total city population of 148,700.

55% of Jezkazgan&#x27;s population are Kazakhs and 30% Russians, with smaller minorities of Ukrainians, Germans, Chechens and Koreans.

==Geography and climate==
Jezkazgan is situated by river Karakengir, in the heart of the Kazakh Uplands. A reservoir was built on the river at the time of the Kazakh SSR. The city is near the geographic center of Kazakhstan. It has an extremely continental cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;); rain is frequent but never heavy and monthly rainfall has never reached . The average temperature ranges from in July to in January, whilst extremes ranges from in June 1988 to in February 1951.

==History==
The city was created in 1938 in connection with the exploitation of the rich copper deposits. In 1973, a large mining and metallurgical complex was constructed to the southeast to smelt the copper that until then had been sent elsewhere for processing. Other metal ores mined and processed locally are manganese and iron. Also in 1973, the city became the administrative center of the newly formed Dzhezkazgan Oblast, created out of Karaganda Oblast. In 1997, Dzhezkazgan (at this point Jezkazgan) Oblast was liquidated and the city became part of Karaganda Oblast once again. On 16 March 2022, It was announced by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev that Jezkazgan would become the administrative center of the new Ulytau Region. His decree came into force on 8 June 2022, thus making Jezkazgan the administrative center of a Region once again.

During the Soviet era, Jezkazgan was the site of a Gulag labor camp, Kengir, mentioned in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, and Alexander Dolgun&#x27;s &quot;An American In The Gulag&quot;, and the period of forced resettlement of Koreans from the Russian Far East.

==Industry==
Today the city is the headquarters of the copper conglomerate Kazakhmys, the city&#x27;s main employer. The company has subsidiaries in China, Russia and the United Kingdom and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. There is a power station, Kazakhmys Power Plant, with generation capacity of 207 MW and a 220-meter-tall main chimney.

==Transport==
Jezkazgan has a rail line to the regional capital city Karaganda.

Jezkazgan is connected by road to Karaganda via European route E018 and Kyzylorda and Arkalyk via European route E123. The city is accessible by air via the Zhezkazgan Airport.

==Soyuz emergency landings==
The Soyuz 33 spacecraft returning cosmonauts from outer space landed in the remote flat countryside surrounding Jezkazgan in 1979. The Baikonur Cosmodrome lies to the southwest and, by tradition, every cosmonaut plants a tree on Jezkazgan&#x27;s Seyfullin-Boulevard to mark his or her safe return from space.

Again on 11 October 2018 the Soyuz MS-10/56S landed near Jezkazgan when a booster failed during launch.

Luna 16&#x27;s samples from the Moon returned close to here on 24 September 1970.

==Economical and ecological challenges==
Zhezkazgan is a monocity. The city is economically unstable since the city functions only because of one enterprise (resource), which constrains its development. Zhezkazgan has a great potential to become the logistics center of Kazakhstan, as it connects North and South, West, and East. Raw materials and people can be transported more efficiently through the Zhezkazgan via transit. But infrastructure and roads do not allow it. The profit of Zhezkazgan is mainly spent on the development of such large cities as Nur-Sultan, Almaty, Karaganda, etc. And a small percentage is used by Zhezkazgan itself. Monotowns are very dependent on their enterprise and price fluctuations in the world market. Changes in these aspects can lead to severe economic problems in the city. 
Civil servants have understood this and are trying to create and develop different sources of income. For example, “Zhezkazgan-Beyneu” was built to link Europe and the Persian Gulf and export products. The railway line connects West and East, North and South, creating an opportunity for tourists to visit Zhezkazgan. Investments must also be made in green technologies and methods to meet international standards.

In Zhezkazgan, falling water levels, poor drinking water quality, and air pollution damage the health of urban residents and the environment. According to KAZHYDROMET RMK, air pollution in Zhezkazgan is very high. And the Kengir reservoir has class 5 pollution, which is the highest indicator. Sulfurous anhydride, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide in a gaseous and liquid state can be found in huge quantities in the atmosphere. But the amount of these harmful gases is becoming less and less every year. For example, the emission of these gases decreased by 33.7% in the period 2012-2016. The factories in Zhezkazgan are located in the South, West, and East of the city. In the area of these plants, you can find a high concentration of inorganic dust (which contains sulfuric copper, lead sulfide), nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, coal dust, parts of zinc, lead, copper and aluminum, wood dust, hydrogen sulfide, carbon-sulfur, etc. 
Mostly people from the eastern and southern parts of the city suffer from this the most. The factories are located very close to the town, which violates international sanitary and environmental standards. The farthest factory is located 4900 meters, and the closest one is 500 meters from the city. This pollutes the water, air, soil of the earth and causes disease among residents.

<doc id="512253" wikidata="Q11020382" url="?curid=512253" title="Ken Masters">
<text>is a character in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game series. The character was first introduced in the 1987 title &quot;Street Fighter&quot; as an alternate fighter to Ryu. While Ken and Ryu are devoted to testing their power, Ken instead focuses on developing a family with his spouse Elisa. Ken becomes a mainstay in the following &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games. An alternate brainwashed version of him, , has also been featured in a few of his appearances. Ken&#x27;s presence is in several sequels to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series in addition to its related media. He has also made crossover appearances in &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;

Capcom designer Takashi Nishiyama created Ken when developing the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game. However, due to budget problems, Ken could only use Ryu&#x27;s moves, which later resulted in their characterization as friendly rivals and fellow students of Gouken. Shoei Okano eventually redesigned the character in later games. Seeking to make the character more unique, Capcom redesigned Ken&#x27;s red gi in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, though the latter resulted in changing his entire character depicting his life as less stable.

Despite being recognized as a clone of Ryu, Ken develops a more social life rather than devoting his life to his training like Ryu. Their similarities inspired the term Shotokans in other fighting games besides &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. The evolution of his gameplay and design has been popular among gamers for becoming more unique. However, some critics were critical of his role in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, which was significantly changed due to the sudden increase in depression resulting from losing his family.

==Creation==
Capcom designer Takashi Nishiyama created Ken&#x27;s character as he became &quot;Street Fighter&quot; director when coming up ideas with a project. Inspired by &quot;Spartan X&quot;, Nishiyama took notes about the needs of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Planner Hiroshi Matsumoto was influenced by martial arts which led to the usage of multiple styles. Nishiyama thinks the most regrettable experience of the game was the fact that, they had all these ideas for coming up with different playable characters that they wanted to put into the game, but due to budget concerns, scheduling concerns, among others, eventually that got reduced to only Ken and Ryu. Nishiyama would have loved to have more playable characters, but Capcom were only able to put in just the two of them. In the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, Ken fought barefoot and wore yellow arm bands without gloves. Ken and Ryu shared the same moves despite their different races as a symbol of being rivals and fellow students but was given a more competitive personality than Ryu. The special technique energy wave attack was based on the wave motion gun from the titular spacecraft in the sci-fi anime series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, which Nishiyama watched during the seventies. Ken and Ryu&#x27;s other two techniques from the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, and were inspired by actual martial arts moves, which were exaggerated for the character. These three moves were reused in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; by master Gouken but stronger based on Kamei&#x27;s desire to make the master more skilled in comparison. Ken and develop Ryu stronger versions of the Hadoken due to a desire of Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda in regards to the size of the move in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Shoei Okano animated the new Hadoken.

===Development===

In &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Ken and Ryu were originally going to be Y.S.&#x27;s characters; however, he ended up taking over in the early stages. Okano remembers making the dot patterns for the Shoryuken and the Hadoken special moves first. After that, he moved away from game design and created a design room for the illustrations and manuals. Akiman recalls having drafts for most characters except Ken and Ryu. Y.S. eventually finished the characters. From there, the first move he made was the Hadoken. Ryu and Ken &quot;are the so-called standard characters in the&quot; game, and since they were coming from the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, they could have the other characters be &quot;weirdos&quot;. He gave them a stoic feel. Numerous spinoff products were made as well during the game&#x27;s popularity: when Capcom licensed Hasbro to produce a line of action figures, Ken was given the surname &quot;Masters&quot; to avoid trademark conflict with Mattel&#x27;s Ken dolls. The full name Ken Masters was used in the animated &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; movie and in the &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot; series before being canonized in the video games with &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;.

Producer Yoshiki Okamoto noted that Ken ended up being far more powerful than Ryu in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; despite having the same special moves. During testing locations, Capcom noticed the North American player had more victories. Although the staff had to say in interviews that the duo were equals, there was a cheat that made Ken stronger. This was due to a mechanic called Core. The way special moves were performed in 1991 gave characters a fragment of time they were more vulnerable. Because Capcom realized the mistake cause by Core, they removed it from the video game except Ryu. This was caused by a difference in the formation of the Shoryuken that left Ryu altered whereas Ken kept strong enough to perform two special moves in a row. This resulted in Ken being the stronger of the Karate duo. Despite being an aggressive character, Ken is unnotable for aerial combat, making him weaker to Dhalsim, Sagat and Guile in this occasion. He becomes more offensive with the &quot;Alpha&quot; series.

The first decision when making the prequel &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; was keeping Ken, Ryu and Chun-Li. Capcom did not want to end up with just Japanese and Asian characters. As much as we could, they wanted to think in terms of creating a good balance, with all sorts of different skin colors. The secret of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; is the Ryu and Ken vs. Bison team up mode, where if word did not get out, we figured we would just stay silent. However, the staff spoiled it. While they found such idea fun, it eventually became a troublesome mode. This eventually inspired more team up fights involving characters who wear opposing colors like Ryu and Ken. Yasuda disliked the handling of Ryu and Ken as old characters, resulting in the creation of Sakura Kasugano as a response to a younger, cooler fighter that contrast the others especially in outfits. Though Ken did not undergo several changes in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, he and Ryu Rufus were meant to be have an acrobatic bald slender black male wearing a &quot;gi&quot; named &quot;King Cobra&quot;, meant to be a more, the character became Rufus. Reuben Langdon voiced Ken in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;. David Matranga took over in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, feeling responsibility for it as a result of the series&#x27; popularity. He also regarded Ken as iconic based on how he gets the chance to yell his attack&#x27;s names which required lessons of screaming and grunting.

===Designs===

In the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, Ken fought barefoot and wore yellow arm bands without gloves. Ken and Ryu were designed to be nearly identical and share the same moves despite their different races. Y.S. was in charge of Ken and Ryu in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Ken has neck-length dyed-blonde hair, black eyebrows, and wears a red sleeveless keikogi with a black belt.

The Karate duo which coined the term Shotocon for sharing the same moves and similar designs. Shotocons were created in other franchises and more in &quot;Street Fighter&quot; follow ups. This includes the antagonistic Akuma, the young Sakura Kasugano and the parody character Dan Hibiki. In the prequel &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; Capcom did not want to end up with just Japanese and Asian characters. As much as we could, they wanted to think in terms of creating a good balance, with all sorts of different skin colors. The secret of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; is the Ryu and Ken vs. Bison team up mode, where if word did not get out, we figured we would just stay silent.

For &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, Capcom, had planned to add more moves for Ken, but his special was already qualified as Shoryuken so strong, he kind of became a &quot;one-trick pony character&quot;. Even if players had problems with him, he was still strong enough to defeat several other characters. Capcom noted Ken and Ryu have a more American style of Karate, so they created fellow fighter Makoto to have a more Japanese style. They tried to make her moveset and controls reflect that, too. Ken remained as one of the most requested characters in location tests of the games.

By the time of &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, Ken&#x27;s appearance underwent a design change. Ken&#x27;s gi top now hangs around his waist and he wears a black v-neck training shirt with several red linings in its place. He sports black sparring gloves and has his hair tied back in a topknot instead of hanging loose which it was grown into medium length after the events of &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series and now wears black ankle wraps with red linings instead of barefoot. For this game, Capcom wanted to differentiate Ken and Ryu&#x27;s moves since they have been seen as &quot;clones&quot;. According to &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; Senior Manager Matt Dahlgren, &quot;Ken&#x27;s more of the hothead. He&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s gonna rush you down and be in your face, so his V-Skill is a run move that can be used to constantly pressure your opponent.&quot; In &quot;Undisputed Street Fighter: A 30th Anniversary Retrospective&quot;, it was noted that while Ken was already a popular character in previous games, his redesign in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; helped to improve it thanks to its more original take. This also was helped by the fact that Ken&#x27;s special moves have flames in contrast to Ryu&#x27;s electric Denjin Hadoken. After 30 years in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, the moves and new designs help Ken look his own.

While still performing similar moves in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Ken and Ryu were designed to play different; Ken became more aggressive and dynamic whereas Ryu was more defensive and strategic. By this game, Capcom decided to alter Ken&#x27;s design far more than in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; dropping his red gi. Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka addressed this change in the character claimed that with every installment Ken&#x27;s life became more stable and wanted to create a reason. When comparing the two heroes in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Fujioka says &quot;Ken as a fiery and explosive character&quot; when compared to the serious Ryu. In the &quot;Alpha&quot; series, he was a little more playful and lighthearted in a way. Capcom wanted to contrast Ken to the new lead Luke. As a result, Capcom decided to give Ken a more serious situation in the story compared to his previous appearances as he can no longer see his family. In writing this, Capcom closely worked with Udon Entertainment to write Ken&#x27;s decay. Fujioka believes the team were successful at changing Ken&#x27;s character.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
====&quot;Street Fighter&quot; games====
Ken made his first appearance in 1987 in the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. He is characterized as the best friend, and rival of the main character, Ryu, who trained under the same master, Gouken. The single-player tournament can only be played with Ken after the second player defeats the first player in a two-player match. Ken is one of the three characters from the original game to return in the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, in 1991—here, Ken is invited to participate in the World Warrior tournament by Ryu, having already moved away from Japan to live in America. In Ken&#x27;s ending, he ends up marrying his girlfriend Eliza. As revealed in the spin-off &quot;Street Fighter EX2&quot;, this makes him brothers-in-law with fellow fighter Guile, who married Eliza&#x27;s older sister, Julia. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was a breakaway hit for Capcom, leading to the production of revised editions of the same game which included &quot;Champion Edition&quot; and &quot;Hyper Fighting&quot; in 1992, &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Super Turbo&quot; in 1994, which all follow the same plot. The 2017 update &quot;Ultra Street Fighter II&quot; adds a stronger labeled &quot;Violent Ken&quot; in Japan-as an alternate playable character.

&quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; features a younger Ken who is searching for Ryu, having recently won the first &quot;World Warrior&quot; tournament in the events of the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. In Ken&#x27;s ending in the original &quot;Alpha&quot;, he defeats Ryu and heads back to America, where he meets Eliza, telling her his objective is to defeat a certain man. &quot;Alpha&quot; was followed by its own line of sequels: &quot;Alpha 2&quot;, which follows the same plot as in the original &quot;Alpha&quot; where Ken decides to fight Ryu after realizing something happened to his mind after defeating Sagat in the first game. &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; takes place after the events in the first two games has Ken becoming a brainwashed boss controlled by the villain M. Bison should the player use Ryu and then be saved. In Ken&#x27;s story mode, the fighter starts suffering an inferiority complex over Ryu but after fighting his fan Sakura Kasugano he gets over it thanks to her spirit. Afterwards, Ken defeats Bison in his route.

Ken&#x27;s following appearance is in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;. The storyline reveals that he is still friendly with Ryu and has a student named Sean. In his ending from the first two installment, it is revealed that Ken has a son named Mel who is already a child. In the sequel &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot;, Ken&#x27;s ending involves him winning a fighting tournament and celebrating it with his family and Sean. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Ken enters into the world tournament while waiting for the birth of Mel worried about being able to become a proper family man while worrying about his competition. In his ending, Ken reunites with his wife and his newborn child Mel happily. Ken also appears in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;; Ken and Ryu&#x27;s younger ages are also explored in the tutorial similar to the &quot;Alpha&quot; trilogy. His adult years as a family man are also given their own stage where the Masters family remember their previous years with Ryu and fights Birdie in the present. He later goes to a party from Sakura&#x27;s friend Karin who challenges to another fight. In the end, Ken and Eliza makes it to the party properly where the former worries about Ryu&#x27;s fight with his inner darkness. Ken also appears playable in the larger &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; story mode where he is recruited by Chun-Li&#x27;s forces to take down Bison&#x27;s group when Mel was two years old.

In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, set years after the events of &quot;III&quot;, where Mel is now a teenager, Ken originally planned to form partnerships with JP and the young King of Nayshall to build the country&#x27;s first coliseum martial arts tournament while hiring Luke as Mel&#x27;s bodyguard. However, Ken learns that JP is a leader of terrorist group known as Amnesia, having manipulated Ken into unknowingly funding his criminal activities instead of opening the tournament. Then, Deepfake footage of Ken frames him for taking part in the conspiracy. As his situation is dire, Ken goes into hiding to protect his family while hunting JP, ever since the latter briefly kidnapped Mel during the incident. In the game&#x27;s World Tour mode, the player can find Ken working at a construction site while keeping a low profile. Though his name has been cleared at this point, he begins to question what he is fighting for.

====Other games====
In 1990, Capcom produced an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled &quot;Street Fighter 2010: The Final Fight&quot;. The Japanese version of the game starred an original character named Kevin Straker, a cyborg policeman who fought against alien creatures in the future. When Capcom released &quot;2010&quot; in North America, the main character&#x27;s identity was changed from Kevin to Ken, with the game&#x27;s story rewritten to imply that he was the same Ken from the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Other than that, the game has little or no plot ties to the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and its part in the canonical &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series is disputed. Beased on the first animated movies, Ken appears playable in its game adaptation.

Outside the mainstream &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games, Ken appears in the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; games and in the mobile game &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot;. He also appears in crossover titles like &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;, the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series, and &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. (In the game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, Ryu is able to access Ken&#x27;s moveset when the player enters a certain command.) He also appears in the Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie and arcade versions of &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;. In SNK Playmore&#x27;s fighting game &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; he has an alter-ego named Violent Ken, who later made his full &quot;Street Fighter&quot; debut in &quot;Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers&quot;. Ken is featured in the tactical role-playing games &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, and &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;. Ken also makes a cameo as a Trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, as part of the Ryu DLC. He is playable in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as an &quot;echo fighter&quot; or clone of Ryu. Ken is set to appear in &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; as part of the first season of downloadable content. For the game &quot;Tekken X Street Fighter&quot; producer Katsuhiro Harada commented that while Ryu and Ken might be able to perform his classic moves like the Hadouken reassuring his fans, most of his normal moves would be changed to play more like a &quot;Tekken&quot; character and fit the cast.

===In other media===

He was voiced by Scott McNeil in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series. In &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, he was voiced by Jimmy Theodore in the Animaze dub and Jason Douglas in the ADV Films dub. In the series, Ken and Ryu travel across the world to become stronger, learning to use the Hado energy while training with Dhalsim which attracts Bison in this portrayal. and in &quot;Street Fighter II: The Movie&quot;, he was voiced by Eddie Frierson. Known as the worst&#x27;s strongest warrior after Ryu, Ken is kidnapped and brainwashed by M. Bison to defeat his best friend. In their eventual fight, Ken regains his senses and joins Ryu into defeating Bison together. He was voiced by Kazuya Ichijo in Japanese and Steven Blum in the dub for the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; movie. The 1999 OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot; focuses on Ken and Ryu meeting Shun, a young boy who claims to be Ryu&#x27;s brother. Shun&#x27;s existence brings conflict with Professor Sadler and Rosanov whom Ken and Ryu fight; Sadler and Bison both seek out powerful fighters to absorb their abilities, particularly Ryu&#x27;s Dark Hadou. Ryu searches for Shun after he is kidnapped by Rosanov, confronting Akuma in the process. The 2005 OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Generations&quot; features a similar storyline but Ken plays a minor role in comparison.

Damian Chapa portrayed Ken in the 1994 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; movie, where he and Ryu (played by Byron Mann) are traveling con artists who steal money from wealthy crime bosses/lords and drug kingpins though various schemes such as selling modified toy guns.

British actor Christian Howard portrayed Ken in the live-action short film &quot;Street Fighter: Legacy&quot;, and reprised his role in the follow-up series &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter: Resurrection&quot;. Taking place to a time similar to Street Fighter Alpha, the younger Ken is shown to be arrogant and impatient, and was brought to Japan at a young age by his father (a friend of Gouken&#x27;s) to Gouken&#x27;s dojo following the death of his mother. He finds a book showing the techniques of the Satsui no Hado and is warned by Gouken not to use them. During a bout with Ryu, Ryu is taken over by the Satsui No Hado, forcing Ken to nearly kill him with a flaming Shoryuken. As Gouken sends his two students off, he trusts Ken to look after Ryu. Ken has also appeared in printed adaptations that retell his role in the games.

==Reception==
Ken artwork was featured on an officially licensed NubyTech/UDON joypad for the PlayStation 2, which was announced on September 27, 2004; and a Mad Catz joypad for the PlayStation 3. &quot;GamePro&quot; said Ken and Ryu were the most notable palette swapped characters, with GamesRadar writer Tyler Wilde noted they have their own development. However, IGN&#x27;s Jesse Schedeen stated that Ken could &quot;easily suffer from Luigi Syndrome&quot; for his resemblance with Ryu, but thanks to the sequels, Ken gained his own fighting style separated from Ryu&#x27;s. Comic Book Resources specifically mentioned how Capcom made Ken more on his social life than Ryu that made his character more unpredictable to see what would happen to see him in every installment. His marriage is noted for changing his personality as the character decided to choose his wife over life competitions despite still being a playable character in every installment. In &quot;“You Must Defeat Shen Long To Stand A Chance”: Street Fighter, Race, Play, and Player&quot;, Nicholas R. Ware from Bowling Green State University said Ken was Ryu&#x27;s American counterpart due to their mulitple similarities with Akuma instead being the darker one. However, both Ryu and Ken were noted by the writer to be nearly identical when it comes to gameplay in early installments of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise and only stand out due to their visual differences. The narrativge of &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; would however explain this as the new character Gouken is revealed to be their mentor and he also uses variations of their three common special moves. Benjamin Wai-ming Ng from the University of Hong Kong further added that while characters like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-li may have been popular in Japan and other parts of the world, in China, they were overshadowed by the main characters from SNK&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series. In the book &quot;Japanese Culture Through Video Games&quot;, Ken is seen to be used to reinforce &quot;national-cultural fantasy&quot; as done with Ryu&#x27;s characterization of a Japanese fighter with supernatural powers. After the first game, Ryu kept overshadowing Ken and newcomer Chun-Li as Ryu kept being used as the main figure of &quot;Street Figher II&quot;. Moreover, the original duo eventually came across as &quot;dull&quot; in sequels when compared to the rest of the cast.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; recommended Ken alongside Ryu for beginners in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; with Ken being better at close-up fights as a result of his powerful uppercuts. In a humor article by GameSpy, the &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; version of Ken was mentioned to have become unbalanced to the point he was the strongest character from the cast. In &quot;Street Fighter III: Third Strike&quot;, Ken was also noted to be one of the three more powerful characters from the game alongside Chun-Li and Yun. Similarly, Dave Cook from Now Gamer called him and &quot;Tekken&quot;″s Eddy Gordo one of the most hated characters from their franchises due to their overpowered moves. Jeremy Parish of Polygon said Ken went in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; &quot;from garbage to glorious&quot;.

In, &quot;Os reis da luta: representações do karate nos jogos digitais&quot; Tiago Oviedo Frosi from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul wrote that Gichin Funakoshi&#x27;s &quot;Shōtōkan&quot; is the most practiced style of Karate in the world, this was the style chosen to characterize most of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters including Ken. The Kyokugenryu Ryo uses in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; instead comes across as a fantasy version of the &quot;knockout&quot; Kyokushinkaikan created by Mas Oyama who serves as an influence for both Ryu&#x27;s and Takuma Sakazaki&#x27;s characters, leading to the similarities between two characters from different franchices. The crossovers with SNK games though became popular as Terry Bogard from &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; was also created by Ken&#x27;s creator. In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Terry was included as a guest since Nishiyama had created the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; during his time at Capcom Terry and Ken have had past dialogue between them; They were very conscious of their relationship when they created them. GamerFocus was pleased with Ken&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; due to how SNK chose to represent Capcom and become another spiritual sequel to the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series.

Before the release of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, fans were confused about Ken&#x27;s new design as discussed by &quot;GamesRadar&quot;. They noted that &quot;he&#x27;s been tossed out of the house by his wife and left in the gutter&quot; leading to several speculations. The miserable design was also noted to contrast Ryu&#x27;s better received new look. The resulted in gags where Ryu prioritized his free time into helping his best friend and that Ken was in so poor shape that he could barely perform his own techniques according to the media. With the reveal of Ken&#x27;s narrative in the installment, &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted Ken&#x27;s portrayal was hilarious as he has become &quot;crypto-bro&quot;. The commentaries involving Ken going on a divorce and losing custody of his children led to internet memes involving pictures of the depressed fighter. Capcom&#x27;s reveal that Ken&#x27;s divorce was true resulted in &quot;Kotaku&quot; noting that fans were correct with the action of making so many memes. Polygon comically claimed that while Ken was not divorced in response to the fandom&#x27;s takes, Capcom had to explain well what disaster forced Ken to split from his family and that his new designed made him across as miserable when compared to his previous incarnations.

Ken has also been popular thanks to Evo Moment 37. With 26 seconds remaining, Justin Wong had the option to run out the clock, but he was eager to end the match. Daigo Umehara&#x27;s Ken parried Chun-Li&#x27;s multihit Super Art II move, within six of sixty frames of the impact animation – about a tenth of a second. Umehara had to predict when his opponent would start his Super Art Move, essentially making the first parry before the move even started, and then perform the same split-second timing on all 14 of the remaining hits. Umehara did so, and went on to counter a final kick of Chun-Li in mid-air before launching a 12-hit combo, capped by Ken&#x27;s Super Art III.

<text>ATLAS is the largest general-purpose particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The experiment is designed to take advantage of the unprecedented energy available at the LHC and observe phenomena that involve highly massive particles which were not observable using earlier lower-energy accelerators. ATLAS was one of the two LHC experiments involved in the discovery of the Higgs boson in July 2012. It was also designed to search for evidence of theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.

The experiment is a collaboration involving 6,003 members, out of which 3,822 are physicists (last update: June 26, 2022) from 257 institutions in 42 countries.
==History==

===Particle accelerator growth===
The first cyclotron, an early type of particle accelerator, was built by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1931, with a radius of just a few centimetres and a particle energy of 1 megaelectronvolt (MeV). Since then, accelerators have grown enormously in the quest to produce new particles of greater and greater mass. As accelerators have grown, so too has the list of known particles that they might be used to investigate.

===ATLAS Collaboration===

The ATLAS Collaboration, the international group of physicists belonging to different universities and research centres who built and run the detector, was formed in 1992 when the proposed EAGLE (Experiment for Accurate Gamma, Lepton and Energy Measurements) and ASCOT (Apparatus with Super Conducting Toroids) collaborations merged their efforts to build a single, general-purpose particle detector for a new particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider. At present, the ATLAS Collaboration involves 6,003 members, out of which 3,822 are physicists (last update: June 26, 2022) from 257 institutions in 42 countries.

===Detector design and construction===
The design was a combination of two previous projects for LHC, EAGLE and ASCOT, and also benefitted from the detector research and development that had been done for the Superconducting Super Collider, a US project interrupted in 1993. The ATLAS experiment was proposed in its current form in 1994, and officially funded by the CERN member countries in 1995. Additional countries, universities, and laboratories have joined in subsequent years. Construction work began at individual institutions, with detector components then being shipped to CERN and assembled in the ATLAS experiment pit starting in 2003.

===Detector operation===
Construction was completed in 2008 and the experiment detected its first single proton beam events on 10 September of that year.

Data-taking was then interrupted for over a year due to an LHC magnet quench incident. On 23 November 2009, the first proton–proton collisions occurred at the LHC and were recorded by ATLAS, at a relatively low injection energy of 900 GeV in the center of mass of the collision. Since then, the LHC energy has been increasing: 1.8 TeV at the end of 2009, 7 TeV for the whole of 2010 and 2011, then 8 TeV in 2012. 
The first data-taking period performed between 2010 and 2012 is referred to as Run I. After a long shutdown (LS1) in 2013 and 2014, in 2015 ATLAS saw 13 TeV collisions.
The second data-taking period, Run II, was completed, always at 13 TeV energy, at the end of 2018 with a recorded integrated luminosity of nearly 140 fb−1 (inverse femtobarn). 
A second long shutdown (LS2) in 2019-22 with upgrades to the ATLAS detector was followed by Run III, which started in July 2022.

=== Leadership ===
The ATLAS Collaboration is currently led by Spokesperson Andreas Hoecker and Deputy Spokespersons Stephane Willocq and Manuella Vincter. Former Spokespersons have been:
==Experimental program==
In the field of particle physics, ATLAS studies different types of processes detected or detectable in energetic collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For the processes already known, it is a matter of measuring more and more accurately the properties of known particles or finding quantitative confirmations of the Standard model. Processes not observed so far would allow, if detected, to discover new particles or to have confirmation of physical theories that go beyond the Standard model.

===Standard Model===

The Standard model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, while omitting gravity) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.

Although the Standard model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the universe as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.

====Precision measurements====
With the important exception of the Higgs boson, detected by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments in 2012, all of the particles predicted by the Standard Model had been observed by previous experiments. In this field, in addition to the discovery of the Higgs boson, the experimental work of ATLAS has focused on precision measurements, aimed at determining with ever greater accuracy the many physical parameters of theory.
In particular for
* the Higgs boson;
* W and Z bosons;
* the top and bottom quarks
ATLAS measures:
* masses;
* channels of production, decay and mean lifetimes;
* interaction mechanisms and coupling constants for electroweak and strong interactions.

For example, the data collected by ATLAS made it possible in 2018 to measure the mass [(80,370±19) MeV] of the W boson, one of the two mediators of the weak interaction, with a measurement uncertainty of ±2.4‰.

====Higgs boson====
One of the most important goals of ATLAS was to investigate a missing piece of the Standard Model, the Higgs boson. The Higgs mechanism, which includes the Higgs boson, gives mass to elementary particles, leading to differences between the weak force and electromagnetism by giving the W and Z bosons mass while leaving the photon massless.

On July 4, 2012, ATLAS — together with CMS, its sister experiment at the LHC — reported evidence for the existence of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson at a confidence level of 5 sigma, with a mass around 125 GeV, or 133 times the proton mass. This new &quot;Higgs-like&quot; particle was detected by its decay into two photons (formula_1) and its decay to four leptons (formula_2 and formula_3).

In March 2013, in the light of the updated ATLAS and CMS results, CERN announced that the new particle was indeed a Higgs boson. The experiments were also able to show that the properties of the particle as well as the ways it interacts with other particles were well-matched with those of a Higgs boson, which is expected to have spin 0 and positive parity. Analysis of more properties of the particle and data collected in 2015 and 2016 confirmed this further.

In October 2013, two of the theoretical physicists who predicted the existence of the Standard Model Higgs boson, Peter Higgs and François Englert, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

====Top quark properties====
The properties of the top quark, discovered at Fermilab in 1995, had been measured approximately. With much greater energy and greater collision rates, the LHC produces a tremendous number of top quarks, allowing ATLAS to make much more precise measurements of its mass and interactions with other particles. These measurements provide indirect information on the details of the Standard Model, with the possibility of revealing inconsistencies that point to new physics.

===Beyond the Standard model===
While the Standard Model predicts that quarks, leptons and neutrinos should exist, it does not explain why the masses of these particles are so different (they differ by orders of magnitude). Furthermore, the mass of the neutrinos should be, according to the Standard Model, exactly zero as that of the photon. Instead, neutrinos have mass. In 1998 research results at detector Super-Kamiokande determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, which dictates that they have a mass other than zero. For these and other reasons, many particle physicists believe it is possible that the Standard Model will break down at energies at the teraelectronvolt (TeV) scale or higher. Most alternative theories, the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) including Supersymmetry (SUSY), predicts the existence of new particles with masses greater than those of Standard Model.

====Supersymmetry====
Most of the currently proposed theories predict new higher-mass particles, some of which may be light enough to be observed by ATLAS. Models of supersymmetry involve new, highly massive particles. In many cases these decay into high-energy quarks and stable heavy particles that are very unlikely to interact with ordinary matter. The stable particles would escape the detector, leaving as a signal one or more high-energy quark jets and a large amount of &quot;missing&quot; momentum. Other hypothetical massive particles, like those in the Kaluza–Klein theory, might leave a similar signature. 
The data collected up to the end of LHC Run II do not show evidence of supersymmetric or unexpected particles, the research of which will continue in the data that will be collected from Run III onwards.

====CP violation====
The asymmetry between the behavior of matter and antimatter, known as CP violation, is also being investigated. Recent experiments dedicated to measurements of CP violation, such as BaBar and Belle, have not detected sufficient CP violation in the Standard Model to explain the lack of detectable antimatter in the universe. It is possible that new models of physics will introduce additional CP violation, shedding light on this problem. Evidence supporting these models might either be detected directly by the production of new particles, or indirectly by measurements of the properties of B- and D-mesons. LHCb, an LHC experiment dedicated to B-mesons, is likely to be better suited to the latter.

====Microscopic black holes====
Some hypotheses, based on the ADD model, involve large extra dimensions and predict that micro black holes could be formed by the LHC. These would decay immediately by means of Hawking radiation, producing all particles in the Standard Model in equal numbers and leaving an unequivocal signature in the ATLAS detector.

==ATLAS detector==
The ATLAS detector is 46 metres long, 25 metres in diameter, and weighs about 7,000 tonnes; it contains some 3,000 km of cable.

At 27 km in circumference, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN collides two beams of protons together, with each proton carrying up to 6.8 TeV of energy – enough to produce particles with masses significantly greater than any particles currently known, if these particles exist. When the proton beams produced by the Large Hadron Collider interact in the center of the detector, a variety of different particles with a broad range of energies are produced.

===General-purpose requirements===
The ATLAS detector is designed to be general-purpose. Rather than focusing on a particular physical process, ATLAS is designed to measure the broadest possible range of signals. This is intended to ensure that whatever form any new physical processes or particles might take, ATLAS will be able to detect them and measure their properties. ATLAS is designed to detect these particles, namely their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins.

Experiments at earlier colliders, such as the Tevatron and Large Electron–Positron Collider, were also designed for general-purpose detection. However, the beam energy and extremely high rate of collisions require ATLAS to be significantly larger and more complex than previous experiments, presenting unique challenges of the Large Hadron Collider.

===Layered design===
In order to identify all particles produced at the interaction point where the particle beams collide, the detector is designed in layers made up of detectors of different types, each of which is designed to observe specific types of particles. The different traces that particles leave in each layer of the detector allow for effective particle identification and accurate measurements of energy and momentum. (The role of each layer in the detector is discussed below.) As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure and stop higher-energy particles. As of 2022, the ATLAS detector is the largest ever built at a particle collider.

===Detector systems===
The ATLAS detector consists of a series of ever-larger concentric cylinders around the interaction point where the proton beams from the LHC collide. Maintaining detector performance in the high radiation areas immediately surrounding the proton beams is a significant engineering challenge. The detector can be divided into four major systems: 
# Inner Detector; 
# Calorimeters; 
# Muon Spectrometer; 
# Magnet system. 
Each of these is in turn made of multiple layers. The detectors are complementary: the Inner Detector tracks particles precisely, the calorimeters measure the energy of easily stopped particles, and the muon system makes additional measurements of highly penetrating muons. The two magnet systems bend charged particles in the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer, allowing their electric charges and momenta to be measured.
The only established stable particles that cannot be detected directly are neutrinos; their presence is inferred by measuring a momentum imbalance among detected particles. For this to work, the detector must be &quot;hermetic&quot;, meaning it must detect all non-neutrinos produced, with no blind spots.

The installation of all the above detector systems was finished in August 2008. The detectors collected millions of cosmic rays during the magnet repairs which took place between fall 2008 and fall 2009, prior to the first proton collisions. The detector operated with close to 100% efficiency and provided performance characteristics very close to its design values.

===Inner Detector===
The Inner Detector begins a few centimetres from the proton beam axis, extends to a radius of 1.2 metres, and is 6.2 metres in length along the beam pipe. Its basic function is to track charged particles by detecting their interaction with material at discrete points, revealing detailed information about the types of particles and their momentum. 
The Inner Detector has three parts, which are explained below.

The magnetic field surrounding the entire inner detector causes charged particles to curve; the direction of the curve reveals a particle&#x27;s charge and the degree of curvature reveals its momentum. The starting points of the tracks yield useful information for identifying particles; for example, if a group of tracks seem to originate from a point other than the original proton–proton collision, this may be a sign that the particles came from the decay of a hadron with a bottom quark (see b-tagging).

====Pixel Detector====
The Pixel Detector, the innermost part of the detector, contains four concentric layers and three disks on each end-cap, with a total of 1,744 &quot;modules&quot;, each measuring 2 centimetres by 6 centimetres. The detecting material is 250 μm thick silicon. Each module contains 16 readout chips and other electronic components. The smallest unit that can be read out is a pixel (50 by 400 micrometres); there are roughly 47,000 pixels per module.

The minute pixel size is designed for extremely precise tracking very close to the interaction point. In total, the Pixel Detector has over 92 million readout channels, which is about 50% of the total readout channels of the whole detector. Having such a large count created a considerable design and engineering challenge. Another challenge was the radiation to which the Pixel Detector is exposed because of its proximity to the interaction point, requiring that all components be radiation hardened in order to continue operating after significant exposures.

====Semi-Conductor Tracker====
The Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) is the middle component of the inner detector. It is similar in concept and function to the Pixel Detector but with long, narrow strips rather than small pixels, making coverage of a larger area practical. Each strip measures 80 micrometres by 12 centimetres. The SCT is the most critical part of the inner detector for basic tracking in the plane perpendicular to the beam, since it measures particles over a much larger area than the Pixel Detector, with more sampled points and roughly equal (albeit one-dimensional) accuracy. It is composed of four double layers of silicon strips, and has 6.3 million readout channels and a total area of 61 square meters.

====Transition Radiation Tracker====
The Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), the outermost component of the inner detector, is a combination of a straw tracker and a transition radiation detector. The detecting elements are drift tubes (straws), each four millimetres in diameter and up to 144 centimetres long. The uncertainty of track position measurements (position resolution) is about 200 micrometres. This is not as precise as those for the other two detectors, but it was necessary to reduce the cost of covering a larger volume and to have transition radiation detection capability. Each straw is filled with gas that becomes ionized when a charged particle passes through. The straws are held at about −1,500 V, driving the negative ions to a fine wire down the centre of each straw, producing a current pulse (signal) in the wire. The wires with signals create a pattern of &#x27;hit&#x27; straws that allow the path of the particle to be determined. Between the straws, materials with widely varying indices of refraction cause ultra-relativistic charged particles to produce transition radiation and leave much stronger signals in some straws. Xenon and argon gas is used to increase the number of straws with strong signals. Since the amount of transition radiation is greatest for highly relativistic particles (those with a speed very near the speed of light), and because particles of a particular energy have a higher speed the lighter they are, particle paths with many very strong signals can be identified as belonging to the lightest charged particles: electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The TRT has about 298,000 straws in total.

===Calorimeters===


The calorimeters are situated outside the solenoidal magnet that surrounds the Inner Detector. Their purpose is to measure the energy from particles by absorbing it. There are two basic calorimeter systems: an inner electromagnetic calorimeter and an outer hadronic calorimeter. Both are &quot;sampling calorimeters&quot;; that is, they absorb energy in high-density metal and periodically sample the shape of the resulting particle shower, inferring the energy of the original particle from this measurement.

====Electromagnetic calorimeter====
The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter absorbs energy from particles that interact electromagnetically, which include charged particles and photons. It has high precision, both in the amount of energy absorbed and in the precise location of the energy deposited. The angle between the particle&#x27;s trajectory and the detector&#x27;s beam axis (or more precisely the pseudorapidity) and its angle within the perpendicular plane are both measured to within roughly 0.025 radians. The barrel EM calorimeter has accordion shaped electrodes and the energy-absorbing materials are lead and stainless steel, with liquid argon as the sampling material, and a cryostat is required around the EM calorimeter to keep it sufficiently cool.

====Hadron calorimeter====
The hadron calorimeter absorbs energy from particles that pass through the EM calorimeter, but do interact via the strong force; these particles are primarily hadrons. It is less precise, both in energy magnitude and in the localization (within about 0.1 radians only). The energy-absorbing material is steel, with scintillating tiles that sample the energy deposited. Many of the features of the calorimeter are chosen for their cost-effectiveness; the instrument is large and comprises a huge amount of construction material: the main part of the calorimeter – the tile calorimeter – is 8 metres in diameter and covers 12 metres along the beam axis. The far-forward sections of the hadronic calorimeter are contained within the forward EM calorimeter&#x27;s cryostat, and use liquid argon as well, while copper and tungsten are used as absorbers.

===Muon Spectrometer===
The Muon Spectrometer is an extremely large tracking system, consisting of three parts: 
# A magnetic field provided by three toroidal magnets; 
# A set of 1200 chambers measuring with high spatial precision the tracks of the outgoing muons; 
# A set of triggering chambers with accurate time-resolution. 
The extent of this sub-detector starts at a radius of 4.25 m close to the calorimeters out to the full radius of the detector (11 m). Its tremendous size is required to accurately measure the momentum of muons, which first go through all the other elements of the detector before reaching the muon spectrometer. It was designed to measure, standalone, the momentum of 100 GeV muons with 3% accuracy and of 1 TeV muons with 10% accuracy. It was vital to go to the lengths of putting together such a large piece of equipment because a number of interesting physical processes can only be observed if one or more muons are detected, and because the total energy of particles in an event could not be measured if the muons were ignored. It functions similarly to the Inner Detector, with muons curving so that their momentum can be measured, albeit with a different magnetic field configuration, lower spatial precision, and a much larger volume. It also serves the function of simply identifying muons – very few particles of other types are expected to pass through the calorimeters and subsequently leave signals in the Muon Spectrometer. It has roughly one million readout channels, and its layers of detectors have a total area of 12,000 square meters.

===Magnet System===


The ATLAS detector uses two large superconducting magnet systems to bend the trajectory of charged particles, so that their momenta can be measured. This bending is due to the Lorentz force, whose modulus is proportional to the electric charge formula_4 of the particle, to its speed formula_5 and to the intensity formula_6 of the magnetic field:
:formula_7
Since all particles produced in the LHC&#x27;s proton collisions are traveling at very close to the speed of light in vacuum formula_8, the Lorentz force is about the same for all the particles with same electric charge formula_4:
:formula_10
The radius of curvature formula_11 due to the Lorentz force is equal to
:formula_12
where formula_13 is the relativistic momentum of the particle. As a result, high-momentum particles curve very little (large formula_11), while low-momentum particles curve significantly (small formula_11). The amount of curvature can be quantified and the particle momentum can be determined from this value.

====Solenoid Magnet====
The inner solenoid produces a two tesla magnetic field surrounding the Inner Detector. This high magnetic field allows even very energetic particles to curve enough for their momentum to be determined, and its nearly uniform direction and strength allow measurements to be made very precisely. Particles with momenta below roughly 400 MeV will be curved so strongly that they will loop repeatedly in the field and most likely not be measured; however, this energy is very small compared to the several TeV of energy released in each proton collision.

====Toroid Magnets====
The outer toroidal magnetic field is produced by eight very large air-core superconducting barrel loops and two smaller end-caps air toroidal magnets, for a total of 24 barrel loops all situated outside the calorimeters and within the muon system. This magnetic field extends in an area 26 metres long and 20 metres in diameter, and it stores 1.6 gigajoules of energy. Its magnetic field is not uniform, because a solenoid magnet of sufficient size would be prohibitively expensive to build. It varies between 2 and 8 Teslameters.

===Forward detectors===

The ATLAS detector is complemented by a set of four sub-detectors in the forward region to measure particles at very small angles. 
# LUCID (LUminosity Cherenkov Integrating Detector) &lt;br&gt; is the first of these detectors designed to measure luminosity, and located in the ATLAS cavern at 17 m from the interaction point between the two muon endcaps; 
# ZDC (Zero Degree Calorimeter) &lt;br&gt; is designed to measure neutral particles on-axis to the beam, and located at 140 m from the IP in the LHC tunnel where the two beams are split back into separate beam pipes; 
# AFP (Atlas Forward Proton) &lt;br&gt; is designed to tag diffractive events, and located at 204 m and 217 m; 
# ALFA (Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS) &lt;br&gt; is designed to measure elastic proton scattering located at 240 m just before the bending magnets of the LHC arc.

===Data systems===

====Data generation====
Earlier particle detector read-out and event detection systems were based on parallel shared buses such as VMEbus or FASTBUS. Since such a bus architecture cannot keep up with the data requirements of the LHC detectors, all the ATLAS data acquisition systems rely on high-speed point-to-point links and switching networks. Even with advanced electronics for data reading and storage, the ATLAS detector generates too much raw data to read out or store everything: about 25 MB per raw event, multiplied by 40 million beam crossings per second (40 MHz) in the center of the detector. This produces a total of 1 petabyte of raw data per second. By avoiding to write empty segments of each event (zero suppression), which do not contain physical information, the average size of an event is reduced to 1.6 MB, for a total of 64 terabyte of data per second.

====Trigger system====
The trigger system uses fast event reconstruction to identify, in real time, the most interesting events to retain for detailed analysis. In the second data-taking period of the LHC, Run-2, there were two distinct trigger levels:

# The Level 1 trigger (L1), implemented in custom hardware at the detector site. The decision to save or reject an event data is made in less than 2.5 μs. It uses reduced granularity information from the calorimeters and the muon spectrometer, and reduces the rate of events in the read-out from 40 MHz to 100 kHz. The L1 rejection factor in therefore equal to 400.
# The High Level Trigger trigger (HLT), implemented in software, uses a computer battery consisting of approximately 40,000 CPUs. In order to decide which of the 100,000 events per second coming from L1 to save, specific analyses of each collision are carried out in 200 μs. The HLT uses limited regions of the detector, so-called Regions of Interest (RoI), to be reconstructed with the full detector granularity, including tracking, and allows matching of energy deposits to tracks. The HLT rejection factor is 100: after this step, the rate of events is reduced from 100 to 1 kHz. The remaining data, corresponding to about 1,000 events per second, are stored for further analyses.

====Analysis process====
ATLAS permanently records more than 10 petabytes of data per year.
Offline event reconstruction is performed on all permanently stored events, turning the pattern of signals from the detector into physics objects, such as jets, photons, and leptons. Grid computing is being used extensively for event reconstruction, allowing the parallel use of university and laboratory computer networks throughout the world for the CPU-intensive task of reducing large quantities of raw data into a form suitable for physics analysis. 
The software for these tasks has been under development for many years, and refinements are ongoing, even after data collection has begun.
Individuals and groups within the collaboration are continuously writing their own code to perform further analyses of these objects, searching the patterns of detected particles for particular physical models or hypothetical particles. This activity requires processing 25 petabytes of data every week.

==Trivia==
The researcher pictured for scale in the famous ATLAS detector image is Roger Ruber, a researcher from Uppsala University, Sweden. Ruber, one of the researchers responsible for the ATLAS detector&#x27;s central cryostat magnet, was inspecting the magnets in the LHC tunnel at the same time Maximilien Brice, the photographer, was setting up to photograph the ATLAS detector. Brice asked Ruber to stand at the base of the detector to illustrate the scale of the ATLAS detector. This was revealed by Maximilien Brice, and confirmed by Roger Ruber during interviews in 2020 with Rebecca Smethurst of the University of Oxford.

<text>The Asia Cup officially known as Men&#x27;s Asia Cup, is the biennial Cricket tournament organised by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). The competition is contested by Asian members&#x27; senior men&#x27;s national cricket teams, determining the continental champion of Asia. It was established in 1983 when the Asian Cricket Council was founded as a measure to promote goodwill between Asian countries being the only continental championship in cricket where the winning team becomes the champion of Asia. India are the defending champions after winning the 2023 edition.

The first edition was held in 1984 in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where the council&#x27;s offices were based until 1995. India boycotted the 1986 tournament due to strained cricketing relations with Sri Lanka. Pakistan boycotted the 1990–91 tournament due to strained political relations with India and the 1993 tournament was cancelled for the same reason. The ACC announced that the tournament would be held biennially from 2009 onwards. The ICC has ruled that all games played in the Asia Cup have official ODI status.

After downsizing the Asian Cricket Council in 2015, it was announced by the ICC that Asia Cup events from 2016 would be played on a rotation basis between One Day International and Twenty20 International format, on the basis of the format of upcoming world events. As a result, the 2016 event was the first event played in the T20I format and functioned as a preparatory tournament ahead of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20.

India, with eight titles (seven ODI and one T20I), is the most successful team in the tournament. Sri Lanka is the second most successful team, with six, while Pakistan have won two titles. Sri Lanka has played the most Asia Cups (16) followed by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (15 each). India has been considered the best Asian team while Sri Lanka has historically been the second best.

==History==

===1980s===
The first edition of the Rothmans Asia Cup was held in 1984 in Sharjah, UAE, the location of the headquarters of the newly formed Asian Cricket Council. The tournament was a round-robin tournament among India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The first match was between Pakistan and the new ICC member Sri Lanka. India won this tournament with two victories, Sri Lanka were the runners up in the tournament with a single victory over Pakistan, while Pakistan went home without winning either of its two games.

Sri Lanka was the host for the second edition in 1986. India pulled out of the tournament due to soured cricketing relations with Sri Lanka after a controversial series in Sri Lanka the previous year. Bangladesh was included for the first time. Sri Lanka won the tournament beating Pakistan in the final.

The third edition, in 1988, was held in Bangladesh, the first time a multi-national cricket tournament was held there. In the final, India beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets to win their second Asia Cup.

===1990s===
The fourth edition of the tournament was held in India in 1990–91. Pakistan had pulled out of the tournament due to strained political relations with India. India retained the Asia Cup defeating Sri Lanka in the final.
In 1993, the tournament was cancelled due to strained political relations between India and Pakistan.

The 8th edition took place in Sri Lanka in 2004. There was a change in the tournament format as UAE and Hong Kong were also included for the first time and the tournament was now divided into three stages – the &quot;Group Stage&quot;, &quot;Super Fours&quot; and the final. The group stage was divided into two groups of 3 teams, each playing each other once. The top two teams from each group qualified for the Super Four stage where they played each other again once. The top two teams in the Super Four stage then qualified for the final. Hosts Sri Lanka, India and UAE were placed in Group A while the then defending champions Pakistan, Bangladesh and Hong Kong were placed in Group B. UAE and Hong Kong were knocked out in the group stage. Bangladesh had the distinction of reaching the second stage in a major tournament for the first time, but played poorly in the Super Fours and got eliminated. India and Sri Lanka topped the Super Four stage and reached the final. In the final, Sri Lanka defeated India by 25 runs to win the Asia Cup. Sanath Jayasuriya was the player of the Tournament.

The ninth edition of the Asia Cup was held in Pakistan. Once again, the 2004 format was retained. The tournament started on 24 June 2008 and the Final was held on 6 July 2008.

On 29 October 2015, following the Asian Cricket Council meeting in Singapore, BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur stated that the 2018 edition of the tournament would be held in India. It will follow the ODI format. However, in April 2018, the tournament was moved to the United Arab Emirates, due to political tensions between India and Pakistan.

India started the tournament as hot favourites defeating Pakistan; however, they could not win against them and Sri Lanka in the super 4 and got knocked out of the tournament. Afghanistan was the only team in the tournament to defeat the eventual winners Sri Lanka.

Pakistan was awarded to host the tournament. However, Indian cricket team was reluctant to visit Pakistan to participate in the tournament. So, after a lot of deliberation, India agreed to play in a hybrid model where India will play all their matches in another country and few other matches will be hosted in Pakistan. Thus, it was the first Asia Cup to be co-hosted by multiple countries; four matches were played in Pakistan, and the remaining nine matches were played in Sri Lanka. The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council were joined by Nepal, who made their ACC Asia Cup debut having qualified for the first time in qualifying the 2023 ACC Men&#x27;s Premier Cup.

<doc id="512270" wikidata="Q936382" url="?curid=512270" title="Hypocalcemia">
<text>Hypocalcemia is a medical condition characterized by low calcium levels in the blood serum. The normal range of blood calcium is typically between 2.1–2.6 mmol/L (8.8–10.7 mg/dL, 4.3–5.2 mEq/L), while levels less than 2.1 mmol/L are defined as hypocalcemic. Mildly low levels that develop slowly often have no symptoms. Otherwise symptoms may include numbness, muscle spasms, seizures, confusion, or in extreme cases cardiac arrest.
The most common cause for hypocalcemia is iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism. Other causes include other forms of hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, kidney failure, pancreatitis, calcium channel blocker overdose, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, and medications such as bisphosphonates or denosumab. Diagnosis should generally be confirmed by determining the corrected calcium or ionized calcium level. Specific changes may also be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Initial treatment for severe disease is with intravenous calcium chloride and possibly magnesium sulfate. Other treatments may include vitamin D, magnesium, and calcium supplements. If due to hypoparathyroidism, hydrochlorothiazide, phosphate binders, and a low salt diet may also be recommended. About 18% of people who are being treated in hospital have hypocalcemia.

==Signs and symptoms==

The neuromuscular symptoms of hypocalcemia are caused by a positive bathmotropic effect (i.e. increased responsiveness) due to the decreased interaction of calcium with sodium channels. Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers, reduced calcium lowers the threshold for depolarization. The symptoms can be recalled by the mnemonic &quot;CATs go numb&quot; - convulsions, arrhythmias, tetany, and numbness in the hands and feet and around the mouth.
==Causes==
Hypoparathyroidism is a common cause of hypocalcemia. Calcium is tightly regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH). In response to low calcium levels, PTH levels rise, and conversely, if there are high calcium levels then PTH secretion declines. However, in the setting of absent, decreased, or ineffective PTH hormone, the body loses this regulatory function, and hypocalcemia ensues. Hypoparathyroidism is commonly due to surgical destruction of the parathyroid glands. Hypoparathyroidism may also be due to an autoimmune problem. Some causes of hypocalcaemia are as follows:

==Mechanism==

Physiologically, blood calcium is tightly regulated within a narrow range for proper cellular processes. Calcium in the blood exists in three primary states: bound to proteins (mainly albumin), bound to anions such as phosphate and citrate, and as free (unbound) ionized calcium. Only the unbound ionized calcium is physiologically active. Normal blood calcium level is between 8.5 and 10.5 mg/dL (2.12 to 2.62 mmol/L) and that of unbound calcium is 4.65 to 5.25 mg/dL (1.16 to 1.31 mmol/L).

==Diagnosis==
Because a significant portion of calcium is bound to albumin, any alteration in the level of albumin will affect the measured level of calcium. A corrected calcium level based on the albumin level is: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 * (4.0 - serum albumin [g/dL]).
Since calcium is also bound to small anions, it may be more useful to correct total calcium for both albumin and the anion gap.

==Management==
Management of this condition includes:
* Intravenous calcium gluconate 10% can be administered, or if the hypocalcaemia is severe, calcium chloride is given instead. This is only appropriate if the hypocalcemia is acute and has occurred over a relatively short time frame. But if the hypocalcemia has been severe and chronic, then this regimen can be fatal, because there is a degree of acclimatization that occurs. The neuromuscular excitability, cardiac electrical instability, and associated symptoms are then not cured or relieved by prompt administration of corrective doses of calcium but rather exacerbated. Such rapid administration of calcium would result in effective over-correction – symptoms of hypercalcemia would follow.
* However, in either circumstance, maintenance doses of both calcium and vitamin-D (often as 1,25-(OH)2-D3, i.e. calcitriol) are often necessary to prevent further decline.

<text>Hypercalcemia, also spelled hypercalcaemia, is a high calcium (Ca2+) level in the blood serum. The normal range for total calcium is 2.1–2.6 mmol/L (8.8–10.7 mg/dL, 4.3–5.2 mEq/L), with levels greater than 2.6 mmol/L defined as hypercalcemia. Those with a mild increase that has developed slowly typically have no symptoms. In those with greater levels or rapid onset, symptoms may include abdominal pain, bone pain, confusion, depression, weakness, kidney stones or an abnormal heart rhythm including cardiac arrest.
Most outpatient cases are due to primary hyperparathyroidism and inpatient cases due to cancer. Other causes of hypercalcemia include sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, Paget disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), vitamin D toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia and certain medications such as lithium and hydrochlorothiazide. Diagnosis should generally include either a corrected calcium or ionized calcium level and be confirmed after a week. Specific changes, such as a shortened QT interval and prolonged PR interval, may be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Treatment may include intravenous fluids, furosemide, calcitonin, intravenous bisphosphonate, in addition to treating the underlying cause. The evidence for furosemide use, however, is poor. In those with very high levels, hospitalization may be required. Haemodialysis may be used in those who do not respond to other treatments. In those with vitamin D toxicity, steroids may be useful. Hypercalcemia is relatively common. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in 1–7 per 1,000 people, and hypercalcaemia occurs in about 2.7% of those with cancer.

==Signs and symptoms==
The neuromuscular symptoms of hypercalcaemia are caused by a negative bathmotropic effect due to the increased interaction of calcium with sodium channels. Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers, increased calcium raises the threshold for depolarization. This results in decreased deep tendon reflexes (hyporeflexia), and skeletal muscle weakness.

Other symptoms include cardiac arrhythmias (especially in those taking digoxin), fatigue, nausea, vomiting (emesis), loss of appetite, abdominal pain, &amp; paralytic ileus. If kidney impairment occurs as a result, manifestations can include increased urination, urination at night, and increased thirst. Psychiatric manifestation can include emotional instability, confusion, delirium, psychosis, and stupor. Calcium deposits known as limbus sign may be visible in the eyes.

Symptoms are more common at high calcium blood values (12.0 mg/dL or 3 mmol/L). Severe hypercalcaemia (above 15–16 mg/dL or 3.75–4 mmol/L) is considered a medical emergency: at these levels, coma and cardiac arrest can result. The high levels of calcium ions decrease the neuron membrane permeability to sodium ions, thus decreasing excitability, which leads to hypotonicity of smooth and striated muscle. This explains the fatigue, muscle weakness, low tone and sluggish reflexes in muscle groups. The sluggish nerves also explain drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, stupor or coma. In the gut this causes constipation. Hypocalcaemia causes the opposite by the same mechanism.

===Hypercalcaemic crisis ===
A hypercalcaemic crisis is an emergency situation with a severe hypercalcaemia, generally above approximately 14 mg/dL (or 3.5 mmol/L).

The main symptoms of a hypercalcaemic crisis are oliguria or anuria, as well as somnolence or coma. After recognition, primary hyperparathyroidism should be proved or excluded.

In extreme cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, removal of the parathyroid gland after surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid death. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours, in parallel with measures to lower serum calcium. Treatment of choice for acutely lowering calcium is extensive hydration and calcitonin, as well as bisphosphonates (which have effect on calcium levels after one or two days).

==Causes==
Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy account for about 90% of cases of hypercalcaemia.

Causes of hypercalcemia can be divided into those that are PTH dependent or PTH independent.

===Parathyroid function===
* Primary hyperparathyroidism
** Solitary parathyroid adenoma
** Primary parathyroid hyperplasia
** Parathyroid carcinoma
** Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1 &amp; MEN2A)
** Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism
* Lithium use
* Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia/familial benign hypercalcemia

===Cancer===
Hypercalcemia of malignancy (cancer) is due to a variety of mechanisms. The two most common are humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and local osteolytic hypercalcemia due to bony metastasis. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy involves the tumor releasing a hormone which increases calcium mobilization (most commonly parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)) into the circulation. PTHrP acts similarly to parathyroid hormone in that it binds to the parathyroid hormone 1 receptors on the kidneys and bones and causes an increased tubular reabsorption of calcium and activation of osteoclast activity, respectively. Osteoclasts are a type of bone cell which cause bone resorption, releasing calcium into the bloodstream. PTHrP also acts by activating rank ligand and inhibiting osteoprotegerin which activates nuclear factor kappa B, which causes further activation of osteoclast activity. The combination of PTHrP driven osteoclast activation and calcium reabsorption by the kidneys causes hypercalcemia associated with malignancy (humoral type).

Another mechanism in which cancer causes hypercalcemia is via local osteolysis due to metastasis to bone. Tumor bone metastasis releases local cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, interleukin-1 beta, TNF alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein. These cytokines activate osteoclasts and inhibit osteoblasts (the cell type responsible for laying down new bone) via the rank ligand pathway leading to bone resorption and calcium release into the bloodstream. The massive release of calcium from bone metastasis and osteoclast activation usually overwhelms the kidney&#x27;s ability to secrete calcium, thus leading to hypercalcemia.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy may also occur due to tumor production of vitamin D or parathyroid hormone. These causes are rare and constitute about 1% of all causes of hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy usually portends a poor prognosis, and the medial survival is 25–52 days of its development. It has an incidence of 30% in those with cancer, and the prevalence is estimated to be about 2-3% in the United States.

Common cancer types that are associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy include:
* Solid tumor with metastasis via local osteolytic hypercalcemia: which can be due to any tumor that metastasizes to the bone. But common causes include breast cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and myeloma or lymphoma of the bone
* Solid tumor with humoral mediation of hypercalcemia: lung cancer (especially squamous cell tumors, a type of non-small cell lung cancer), squamous cell cancers of the head and neck, kidney cancer or other urothelial cancers, and breast cancer.
* Hematologic cancers: including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia
* Ovarian small cell carcinoma of the hypercalcemic type

===Vitamin-D disorders===
* Hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D intoxication)
* Elevated 1,25(OH)2D (see calcitriol under Vitamin D) levels (e.g., sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis, berylliosis, histoplasmosis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
* Idiopathic hypercalcaemia of infancy
* Rebound hypercalcaemia after rhabdomyolysis

===High bone-turnover===
* Hyperthyroidism
* Multiple myeloma
* Prolonged immobilization
* Paget&#x27;s disease
* Thiazide use
* Vitamin A intoxication

===Kidney failure===
* Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
* Aluminium intoxication
* Milk-alkali syndrome

===Other===
* Acromegaly
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
* Williams Syndrome
* Excessive calcium consumption

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis should generally include either a calculation of corrected calcium or direct measurement of ionized calcium level and be confirmed after a week. This is because either high or low serum albumin levels does not show the true levels of ionised calcium. There is, however, controversy around the usefulness of corrected calcium as it may be no better than total calcium.

Once calcium is confirmed to be elevated, a detailed history taken from the subject, including review of medications, any vitamin supplementations, herbal preparations, and previous calcium values. Chronic elevation of calcium with absent or mild symptoms often points to primary hyperparathyroidism or Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. For those who has underlying malignancy, the cancers may be sufficiently severe to show up in history and examination to point towards the diagnosis with little laboratory investigations.

If detailed history and examination does not narrow down the differential diagnoses, further laboratory investigations are performed. Intact PTH (iPTH, biologically active parathyroid hormone molecules) is measured with immunoradiometric or immunochemoluminescent assay. Elevated (or high-normal) iPTH with high urine calcium/creatinine ratio (more than 0.03) is suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism, usually accompanied by low serum phosphate. High iPTH with low urine calcium/creatinine ratio is suggestive of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Low iPTH should be followed up with Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) measurements (though not available in all labs). Elevated PTHrP is suggestive of malignancy. Normal PTHrP is suggestive of multiple myeloma, vitamin A excess, milk-alkali syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, and immobilisation. Elevated Calcitriol is suggestive of lymphoma, sarcoidosis, granulomatous disorders, and excessive calcitriol intake. Elevated calcifediol is suggestive of vitamin D or excessive calcifediol intake.

The normal range is 2.1–2.6 mmol/L (8.8–10.7 mg/dL, 4.3–5.2 mEq/L), with levels greater than 2.6 mmol/L defined as hypercalcaemia. Moderate hypercalcaemia is a level of 2.88–3.5 mmol/L (11.5–14 mg/dL) while severe hypercalcaemia is &gt; 3.5 mmol/L (&gt;14 mg/dL).

===ECG===

Abnormal heart rhythms can also result, and ECG findings of a short QT interval suggest hypercalcaemia. Significant hypercalcaemia can cause ECG changes mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. Hypercalcaemia has also been known to cause an ECG finding mimicking hypothermia, known as an Osborn wave.

==Treatments==
The goal of therapy is to treat the hypercalcaemia first and subsequently effort is directed to treat the underlying cause. In those with a calcium level above 13 mg/dL, calcium level that is rising rapidly or those with altered mental status, urgent treatment is required.

===Fluids and diuretics===
Initial therapy:
** IV fluids is the initial therapy. Hypercalcemia usually causes symptoms that lead to chronic dehydration, such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (inability of the kidney to concentrate the urine). IV fluid rehydration allows the kidneys to excrete more calcium, and usually lowers the calcium level by 1–2 mg/dL.
** increased salt intake also can increase body fluid volume as well as increasing urine sodium excretion, which further increases urinary calcium excretion.
** after rehydration, a loop diuretic such as furosemide can be given to permit continued large volume intravenous salt and water replacement while minimizing the risk of blood volume overload and pulmonary oedema. In addition, loop diuretics tend to depress calcium reabsorption by the kidney thereby helping to lower blood calcium levels
** caution must be taken to prevent potassium or magnesium depletion

===Bisphosphonates and calcitonin===
Additional therapy:
* bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogues with high affinity for bone, especially areas of high bone-turnover.
** they are taken up by osteoclasts and inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, therefore inhibiting calcium release from osteoclasts
** current available drugs include: (1st generation) etidronate, (2nd generation) tiludronate, IV pamidronate, alendronate (3rd generation) zoledronate and risedronate
** Bisphosphonates are used as a first line therapy for those with hypercalcemia of malignancy. They are used as both an acute therapy and are usually continued long term to prevent hypercalcemia.
** Bisphosphonates are not recommended in those with chronic kidney disease or those who are severely dehydrated as they may worsen or cause kidney disease.
** Bisphosphonates caused normalization of calcium levels in 60-90% of patients who were treated for hypercalcemia of malignancy.
* Denosumab is a bone anti-resorptive agent that can be used to treat hypercalcemia in patients with a contraindication to bisphosphonates such as severe kidney failure or allergy.
** Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclasts. It acts by binding RANK ligand preventing it from activating osteoclasts via NFKB.
** Denosumab caused normalization of calcium levels in 70% in those with hypercalcemia of malignancy.
* Calcitonin blocks bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclasts and also increases urinary calcium excretion by the kidneys.
** Usually used in life-threatening hypercalcaemia along with rehydration, diuresis, and bisphosphonates
** Due to its limited duration of action (it works for 48–96 hours, then efficacy decreases as the calcitonin receptors are downregulated) its use is limited to acute hypercalcemia as a bridge therapy until more long-term treatments can be initiated.

===Other therapies===
* rarely used, or used in special circumstances:
** plicamycin inhibits bone resorption (rarely used)
** gallium nitrate inhibits bone resorption and changes structure of bone crystals (rarely used)
** glucocorticoids increase urinary calcium excretion and decrease intestinal calcium absorption
*** no effect on calcium level in normal or primary hyperparathyroidism
*** effective in hypercalcemia due to malignancy with elevated vitamin D levels (many types of malignancies raise the vitamin D level).
*** also effective in hypervitaminosis D and sarcoidosis
** dialysis usually used in severe hypercalcaemia complicated by kidney failure. Supplemental phosphate should be monitored and added if necessary
** phosphate therapy can correct the hypophosphataemia in the face of hypercalcaemia and lower serum calcium, but this can further increase the risk for kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis

==Other animals==
Research has led to a better understanding of hypercalcemia in non-human animals. Often the causes of hypercalcemia have a correlation to the environment in which the organisms live. Hypercalcemia in house pets is typically due to disease, but other cases can be due to accidental ingestion of plants or chemicals in the home. Outdoor animals commonly develop hypercalcemia through vitamin D toxicity from wild plants within their environments.

===Household pets===
Household pets such as dogs and cats are found to develop hypercalcemia. It is less common in cats, and many feline cases are idiopathic. In dogs, lymphosarcoma, Addison&#x27;s disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and chronic kidney failure are the main causes of hypercalcemia, but there are also environmental causes usually unique to indoor pets. Ingestion of small amounts of calcipotriene found in psoriasis cream can be fatal to a pet. Calcipotriene causes a rapid rise in calcium ion levels. Calcium ion levels can remain high for weeks if untreated and lead to an array of medical issues. There are also cases of hypercalcemia reported due to dogs ingesting rodenticides containing a chemical similar to calcipotriene found in psoriasis cream. Additionally, ingestion of household plants is a cause of hypercalcemia. Plants such as &quot;Cestrum diurnum&quot;, and &quot;Solanum malacoxylon&quot; contain ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol which cause the onset of hypercalcemia. Consuming small amounts of these plants can be fatal to pets. Observable symptoms may develop such as polydipsia, polyuria, extreme fatigue, or constipation.

===Outdoor animals===

In certain outdoor environments, animals such as horses, pigs, cattle, and sheep experience hypercalcemia commonly. In southern Brazil and Mattewara India, approximately 17 per cent of sheep are affected, with 60 per cent of these cases being fatal. Many cases are also documented in Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Jamaica, Hawaii, and Bavaria. These cases of hypercalcemeia are usually caused by ingesting &quot;Trisetum flavescens&quot; before it has dried out. Once &quot;Trisetum flavescens&quot; is dried out, the toxicity of it is diminished. Other plants causing hypercalcemia are &quot;Cestrum diurnum&quot;, &quot;Nierembergia veitchii&quot;, &quot;Solanum esuriale&quot;, &quot;Solanum torvum&quot;, and &quot;Solanum malacoxylon&quot;. These plants contain calcitriol or similar substances that cause rises in calcium ion levels. Hypercalcemia is most common in grazing lands at altitudes above 1500 meters where growth of plants like &quot;Trisetum flavescens&quot; is favorable. Even if small amounts are ingested over long periods of time, the prolonged high levels of calcium ions have large negative effects on the animals. The issues these animals experience are muscle weakness, and calcification of blood vessels, heart valves, liver, kidneys, and other soft tissues, which eventually can lead to death.

<doc id="512276" wikidata="Q4864956" url="?curid=512276" title="Barré Studio">
<text>Barré Studio was among the first film studios dedicated to animation and founded by Raoul Barré and William Nolan in 1914. The studio pioneered some early animation processes, including mechanical perforation of cels and animating special effects on glass.

The studio began with advertising films (among the first animated films used to sell something), then got a series with Edison called the &quot;Animated Grouch Chaser&quot;. The series was mostly live-action with a few animated inserts. The studio also put out the &quot;Phables&quot; and &quot;The Boob Weekly&quot; cartoons. Animators included Frank Moser, Gregory La Cava, George Stallings, Tom Norton and Pat Sullivan, all of whom got their starts here. Rube Goldberg was the writer for &quot;The Boob Weekly&quot;.

In 1916, William Randolph Hearst founded International Film Service, and hired all of Barré&#x27;s animators to work for him, including Bill Nolan. Soon afterward, Barré was contacted by Charles Bowers, who had been animating &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; for a year. The series was doing so well that it had outgrown Bowers&#x27; studio. A partnership was formed: Bowers&#x27; animators and series worked on in Barré&#x27;s studio. The result was the Bud Fisher Film Corporation, named for the originator Bud Fisher of the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; comic strip. It was known in the industry as the Barré-Bowers Studio. 

Fisher took all public credit for the cartoons, while Barré supervised the animators and Bowers handled the books. He &quot;handled&quot; the books so well, in fact, that he ruined the company: Barré quit in 1918 to avoid getting charged as an accomplice; Bowers was fired in 1919 &quot;and&quot; 1921. This left Fisher in charge. Barré-Bowers went bankrupt in 1923.

Besides Barré and Bowers, directors at their studio included Manny Gould and Dick Friel. Animators included C. T. Anderson, Clarence Rigby, George Stallings, Ted Sears, Mannie Davis, Burt Gillett, Dick Huemer, Tom Palmer, Ben Sharpsteen, Bill Tytla, Albert Hurter, Carl Lederer, F. M. Follett, Isadore Klein, Milt Gross, Walter Lantz and George Ruffle.

<text>LeRoy Robert Ripley (February 22, 1890 – May 27, 1949) was an American cartoonist, entrepreneur, and amateur anthropologist, who is known for creating the &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; newspaper panel series, television show, and radio show, which feature odd facts from around the world.

Subjects covered in Ripley&#x27;s cartoons and text ranged from sports feats to little-known facts about unusual and exotic sites. He also included items submitted by readers, who supplied photographs of a wide variety of small-town American trivia ranging from unusually shaped vegetables to oddly marked domestic animals, all documented by photographs and then depicted by his drawings.

==Biography==
LeRoy Robert Ripley was born on February 22, 1890, in Santa Rosa, California, although his exact birthdate is disputed. He dropped out of high school after his father&#x27;s death to help his family, and at age 16, he began working as a sports cartoonist for various newspapers. In 1913, he moved to New York City. While drawing cartoons for &quot;The New York Globe&quot; newspaper, he created his first &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; cartoon, published in the December 19, 1918, issue. With a positive response from readers, the cartoon began appearing weekly.

In 1919, Ripley married fourteen-year-old film actress Beatrice Roberts, a child 15 years his junior. He made his first trip around the world in 1922, publishing his travel journal in the newspapers. He became fascinated with unusual and exotic foreign locales and cultures. Because he took the veracity of his claims quite seriously, in 1923, he hired a researcher and polyglot named Norbert Pearlroth as a full-time assistant. In 1926, Ripley&#x27;s cartoons moved from the &quot;New York Globe&quot; to the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

Throughout the 1920s, Ripley continued to broaden the scope of his work and his popularity increased greatly. He published a guide to the game of American handball in 1925. In 1926, he became the New York State handball champion and also wrote a book on boxing. With a proven track record as a versatile writer and artist, he attracted the attention of publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst, who managed the King Features Syndicate. In 1929, Hearst was responsible for &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; making its syndicated debut in 360 newspapers and 17 languages worldwide. With the success of this series assured, Ripley capitalized on his fame by getting the first book collection of his newspaper panel series published.

On November 3, 1929, he drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon saying &quot;Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem.&quot; Despite the widespread belief that &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, with its lyrics by Francis Scott Key set to the music of the English drinking song &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;, was the United States national anthem, Congress had never officially made it so. In 1931, John Philip Sousa published his opinion in favor of giving the song official status, stating, &quot;it is the spirit of the music that inspires&quot; as much as it is Key&#x27;s &quot;soul-stirring&quot; words. By a law signed on March 3, 1931, by President Herbert Hoover, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was adopted as the national anthem of the United States.

Ripley prospered during the Great Depression, netting $500,000 a year by the end of the 1930s. He employed a large staff of researchers, artists, translators, and secretaries to handle a deluge of suggestions for new oddities to report – and he traveled the world in search of curiosities and expanded his media to include radio and Hollywood. He started building museums in major cities. Funding for Ripley&#x27;s highly publicized global travels were provided by the Hearst organization. Always in search of the bizarre, he recorded live radio shows underwater and from the sky, the Carlsbad Caverns, the bottom of the Grand Canyon, snake pits, and other exotic locales. The next year, he hosted the first of a series of two dozen &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; theatrical short films for Warner Bros. and Vitaphone, and King Features published a second collected volume of &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; panels. He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, &quot;Seasons Greetings&quot; (1931), with Ruth Etting, Joe Penner, Ted Husing, Thelma White, Ray Collins, and others. After a trip to Asia in 1932, he opened his first museum, the Odditorium, in Chicago in 1933. The concept was a success, and at one point, Odditoriums were in San Diego, Dallas, Cleveland, San Francisco, and New York City. By this point in his life, Ripley had been voted the most popular man in America by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Dartmouth College awarded him an honorary degree.

World travel became impossible during World War II, so Ripley concentrated on charity pursuit. In 1948, the year of the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; cartoon series, the &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; radio show drew to a close and was replaced with a &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; television series. This was a rather bold move on Ripley&#x27;s part, because of the small number of Americans with access to television at this early time in the medium&#x27;s development. He completed only 13 episodes of the series before he became incapacitated by severe health problems. On May 27, 1949, at age 59, he died from a heart attack in New York City. He was buried in his home town of Santa Rosa in the Oddfellows Lawn Cemetery, which is adjacent to the Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery.

==The comic strip==

Ripley&#x27;s cartoon series was estimated to have 80 million readers worldwide, and he is said to have received more mail than the President of the United States. He became a wealthy man, with homes in New York and Florida, but he always retained close ties to his home town of Santa Rosa, California, and he made a point of bringing attention to the Church of One Tree, a church built entirely from the wood of a single 300-ft (91.4-m)-tall redwood tree, which stands on the north side of Juilliard Park in downtown Santa Rosa.

Ripley claimed to be able to &quot;prove every statement he made&quot; because he worked with professional fact researcher Norbert Pearlroth, who assembled &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; array of odd facts and also verified the small-town claims submitted by readers. Pearlroth spent 52 years as the feature&#x27;s researcher, finding and verifying unusual facts for Ripley, and after Ripley&#x27;s death, for the King Features syndicate editors who took over management of the &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; panel.
Another employee who edited the newspaper cartoon series over the years was Lester Byck. Others who drew the series after Ripley&#x27;s death include Don Wimmer, Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Slogg, Clem Gretter (1941–1949), Carl Dorese, Bob Clarke (1943–1944), Stan Randall, Paul Frehm (1938–1975), who became the panel&#x27;s full-time artist in 1949, and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989).

==Legacy==
Ripley&#x27;s ideas and legacy live on in Ripley Entertainment, a company bearing his name and owned since 1985 by the Jim Pattison Group, a privately held company based in Canada. Ripley Entertainment airs national television shows, features publications of oddities, and has holdings in a variety of public attractions, including Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium, Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not! Museums, Ripley&#x27;s Haunted Adventure, Ripley&#x27;s Mini-Golf and Arcade, Ripley&#x27;s Moving Theater, Ripley&#x27;s Sightseeing Trains, Guinness World Records Attractions, and Louis Tussaud&#x27;s Wax Museums.

<text>The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) (also nicknamed the &quot;Desertron&quot;) was a particle accelerator complex under construction in the vicinity of Waxahachie, Texas, United States.

Its planned ring circumference was with an energy of 20 TeV per proton and was designed to be the world&#x27;s largest and most energetic particle accelerator. The laboratory director was Roy Schwitters, a physicist at the University of Texas at Austin. Department of Energy administrator Louis Ianniello served as its first project director, followed by Joe Cipriano, who came to the SSC Project from the Pentagon in May 1990. After 22.5 km (14 mi) of tunnel had been bored and about US$2 billion spent, the project was canceled by the US Congress in 1993.

== Proposal and development ==

The supercollider was formally discussed in the 1984 National Reference Designs Study, which examined the technical and economic feasibility of a machine with the design energy of 20 TeV per proton.

Early in 1983, HEPAP (High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel) formed the New Facilities for the US High-Energy Physics Program subpanel. Led by Stanford University physicist Stanley Wojcicki, and charged with making recommendations “for a forefront United States High Energy Physics Program in the next five to ten years.” the HEPAP subpanel recommended that the US build the Superconducting Super Collider.

Fermilab director and subsequent Nobel Prize in Physics winner Leon Lederman was a very prominent early supporter – some sources say the architect or proposer – of the Superconducting Super Collider project, as well as a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime. 

A Central Design Group (CDG) was organized in California at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which became the gathering place for physicists to come and support the SSC design effort. In the mid-1980s, many leading high-energy physicists, including theorist J. David Jackson of Berkeley, Chris Quigg of Fermilab, Maury Tigner of Cornell, Stanley Wojcicki, as well as Lederman, Chicago’s James Cronin, Harvard theorist Sheldon Glashow, and Roy Schwitters, continued their efforts to promote the Super Collider.

An extensive U.S. Department of Energy review was also done during the mid-1980s. Seventeen shafts were sunk and of tunnel were bored by late 1993.

==Partial construction and financial issues==
During the design and the first construction stage, a heated debate ensued about the high cost of the project. In 1987, Congress was told the project could be completed for $4.4 billion, and it gained the enthusiastic support of Speaker Jim Wright of nearby Fort Worth, Texas. A recurring argument was the contrast with NASA&#x27;s contribution to the International Space Station (ISS), a similar dollar amount. Critics of the project (Congressmen representing other US states and scientists working in non-SSC fields who felt the money would be better spent on their own fields) argued that the US could not afford both of them.

Estimates of the additional cost caused by not using existing physical and human infrastructure at Fermilab in Illinois range from $495 million to $3.28 billion.

Leaders hoped to get financial support from Europe, Canada, Japan, Russia, and India. This was hindered by promotion of the project as promoting American superiority. European funding remained at CERN, which was already working on the Large Hadron Collider. India pledged $50 million, but talks with Japan floundered over trade tensions in the automobile industry. A US-Japanese trade mission where SSC funding was supposed to be discussed ended in the George H. W. Bush vomiting incident.

Congress began appropriating annual funding for the project. In 1992, it was opposed by the majority of the House of Representatives (231-181), but was included in the final reconciled budget due to support in the Senate (62-32).
Early in 1993, a group supported by funds from project contractors organized a public relations campaign to lobby Congress directly in support of the project.
In February, the General Accounting Office reported a $630 million overrun in the $1.25 billion construction budget. By March, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the estimated total cost had grown to $8.4 billion. In June, the non-profit Project on Government Oversight released a draft audit report by the Department of Energy&#x27;s Inspector General heavily criticizing the Super Collider for its high costs and poor management by officials in charge of it.
The Inspector General investigated $500,000 in questionable expenses over three years, including $12,000 for Christmas parties, $25,000 for catered lunches, and $21,000 for the purchase and maintenance of office plants. The report also concluded that there was inadequate documentation for $203 million in project spending, or 40% of the money spent up to that point.

In 1993 U.S. President Bill Clinton tried to prevent the cancellation by asking Congress to continue &quot;to support this important and challenging effort&quot; through completion because &quot;abandoning the SSC at this point would signal that the United States is compromising its position of leadership in basic science&quot;.

==Cancellation==

After $2 billion had been spent ($400 million by the host state of Texas, the rest by the Department of Energy), the House of Representatives rejected funding on October 19, 1993, and Senate negotiators failed to restore it.
Following Rep. Jim Slattery&#x27;s successful orchestration in the House, President Clinton signed the bill that finally canceled the project on October 30, 1993, stating regret at the &quot;serious loss&quot; for science.

Many factors contributed to the cancellation: rising cost estimates (to $12bn); poor management by physicists and Department of Energy officials; the end of the need to prove the supremacy of American science with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War; belief that many smaller scientific experiments of equal merit could be funded for the same cost; Congress&#x27;s desire to generally reduce spending (the United States was running a $255bn budget deficit); the reluctance of Texas Governor Ann Richards; and President Bill Clinton&#x27;s initial lack of support for the project began during the administrations of Richards&#x27;s predecessor, Bill Clements, and Clinton&#x27;s predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. The project&#x27;s cancellation was also eased by opposition from within the scientific community. Prominent condensed matter physicists, such as Philip W. Anderson and Nicolaas Bloembergen, testified before Congress opposing the project. They argued that, although the SSC would certainly conduct high-quality research, it was not the only way to acquire new fundamental knowledge, as some of its supporters claimed, and so was unreasonably expensive. Scientific critics of the SSC pointed out that basic research in other areas, such as condensed matter physics and materials science, was underfunded compared to high energy physics, despite the fact that those fields were more likely to produce applications with technological and economic benefits.

===Reactions to the cancellation===
Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in Physics, placed the cancellation of the SSC in the context of a bigger national and global socio-economic crisis, including a general crisis in funding for science research and for the provision of adequate education, healthcare, transportation and communication infrastructure, and criminal justice and law enforcement.

Leon Lederman, a leading promoter and advocate of the SSC, wrote a popular science book in the context of the project&#x27;s last years and loss of congressional support. Published in 1993, &quot;The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?&quot; sought to promote awareness of the significance of the scientific work which the SSC would have supported. The book popularized the nickname &quot;the God particle&quot; for the Higgs boson.

The closing of the SSC had adverse consequences for the southern part of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, contributing to a mild recession especially in those parts of Dallas which lay south of the Trinity River. When the project was canceled, of tunnel and 17 shafts to the surface were already dug, and nearly two billion dollars had already been spent on the massive facility.

== Comparison with the Large Hadron Collider ==

The SSC&#x27;s planned collision energy of 2 x 20 = 40 TeV was roughly three times that of the 2 x 6.8 = 13.6 TeV (as of 2023) of its European counterpart, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. However, the planned luminosity was only one tenth of the design luminosity of the LHC.

Although some claimed that the SSC cost was largely due to the massive civil engineering project of digging a huge tunnel, that was somewhat of a distortion. The tunneling and conventional facility buildout budget was only about ten percent of the total budgeted cost (1.1 billion dollars out of a total cost of 10 billion). The major cost item was the magnets, still in laboratory development phase, consequently with a higher level of uncertainty attached to the final cost. The ring circumference of the LHC is , compared to the planned of the SSC.

The LHC&#x27;s advantage in terms of cost was the use of the pre-existing engineering infrastructure and 27 km long cavern of the Large Electron–Positron Collider, and its use of a different, innovative magnet design to bend the higher energy particles into the available tunnel. The LHC eventually cost the equivalent of about 5 billion US dollars to build. The total operating budget of CERN runs to about $1 billion per year. The Large Hadron Collider became operational in August 2008.

In a 2021 interview, Schwitters speculated that, had the project been completed, it would have led to the discovery of the Higgs boson particle 10 years before its eventual discovery in Switzerland and attracted an equivalent number of visitors to North Texas as CERN&#x27;s 120,000 per year.

==Fate of the site==
After the project was canceled, the main site was deeded to Ellis County, Texas, and the county tried numerous times to sell the property. The property was sold in August 2006 to an investment group, Collider Data Center, LLC, led by the late J.B. Hunt.

In 2009, Collider Data Center had contracted with GVA Cawley to market the site as a data center. In 2012, chemical company Magnablend bought the property and facilities in the face of some opposition from the local community. The buildings in the facility, which had become prime spots for thieves and drug parties, were renovated and were re-opened in 2013 by Magnablend. The facility makes a range of oil field products for the energy service industry.

==In popular culture==
In Season 3, Episode 15 of Beavis and Butt-Head, titled &quot;Citizen Butt-Head,&quot; which aired on October 18, 1993, the day before Congress cancelled the funding for the Super Collider, an honor student of Highland Highschool is overheard rehearsing his question for President Bill Clinton in which he asks: &quot;Given the budget deficit, do you think the Super Collider is really necessary at this time?&quot;

&quot;Supercollider,&quot; a 1993 song by the Boston-based alternative band Tribe, describes the point of view of a scientist hired to help build the (then-uncancelled) project.

John G. Cramer&#x27;s 1997 hard science fiction novel &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Bridge&quot; centers around a fictional version of the Superconducting Super Collider.

On the February 25, 2001, episode of Futurama, entitled “That’s Lobstertainment!,” a robot comedian makes a Super Collider pun and, in tongue-in-cheek fashion, states that a Super Collider was built.

On the March 6, 2002, episode of The West Wing, the supercollider is discussed when Sam Seaborn is helping an old college physics professor get funding to complete the project.

&quot;A Hole In Texas&quot; is a 2004 novel by Herman Wouk, which describes the adventures of a high-energy physicist following the surprise announcement that a Chinese physicist had discovered the long-sought Higgs boson. Parts of the plot are based on the aborted Superconducting Super Collider project.

On the January 21, 2021, episode of &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; the supercollider is mentioned when Sheldon Cooper&#x27;s (Iain Armitage) mentor Dr. John Sturgis (Wallace Shawn) gets a new job there. A subsequent episode on the April 1, 2021, episode shows an exterior shot of the facility with Dr. Sturgis receiving a phone call from Sheldon&#x27;s grandmother (Annie Potts).

In 2021, the project was cited as a case study of the hypothetical demon of Bureaucratic Chaos, which &quot;blocks good things from happening&quot; at the United States Department of Energy.

<doc id="512291" wikidata="Q1043057" url="?curid=512291" title="Carlos Mastronardi">
<text>Carlos Mastronardi (1901 – June 5, 1976) was an Argentine journalist, poet, and translator. His works included &quot;Luz de provincia&quot;, &quot;Tierra amanecida&quot; (1926), &quot;Conocimiento de la noche&quot; (1937), and &quot;Tratado de la pena&quot;. His non-fiction &quot;Valéry o la infinitud del método&quot; (&quot;Valéry, or the infinitude of method&quot;) won the Buenos Aires Municipal Prize for Literature (1955). Other important works of non-fiction included &quot;Formas de la realidad nacional&quot; (&quot;Forms of the National Reality&quot;, 1961) and &quot;Memorias de un Provinciano&quot; (&quot;Memoirs of a Man from the Provinces&quot;, 1967). Some of his journalism was published posthumously as &quot;Cuadernos de vivir y pensar&quot; (&quot;Notebooks of Living and Thinking&quot;, 1984).

As a translator, Mastronardi was mainly known for translating the French Symbolist poets into Spanish. As a poet, although identified personally with the &quot;avant-garde&quot; of his time, he wrote largely in traditional forms rather than free verse, and rejected what he viewed as his contemporaries&#x27; excessive use of metaphor.

Born in Gualeguay, Entre Ríos Province, Mastronardi came to Buenos Aires at the age of 19. There he became a member of the Martín Fierro group (also known as the Florida group) and an intimate of Jorge Luis Borges, although they disagreed strongly about questions about aesthetics and poetry. Mastronardi figures as a minor character in Borges&#x27;s short story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;.

Mastronardi led a notoriously nocturnal existence. Writing of Mastronardi in 1986 in the newspaper &quot;El País&quot; (Madrid), Borges said of Mastronardi that &quot;Like Auguste Dupin ... [the detective character created by Edgar Allan Poe] ... at night he went about the streets of Buenos Aires looking for that intellectual stimulus that only can be given by nighttime in a great city.&quot;

After a long period in which his work fell into obscurity, Mastronardi&#x27;s works are () being re-published by Argentina&#x27;s Universidad Nacional del Litoral.

== Quotation ==
&quot;Lyric poetry, for many of its ... [Argentine] ... practitioners, lacks all plan and requires no sacrifice. It allows the writer to follow the path of least resistance: everything consists of letting things be. In contrast, narrative, criticism, and essays (almost uncultivated among us), demand preparatory work and organic development.&quot;

<text>Richard Ravon Mears (born December 3, 1951) is an American former race car driver. He is one of four men to win the Indianapolis 500 four times (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991) and is the current record-holder for pole positions in the race with six (1979, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991). Mears is also a three-time Indycar series/World Series champion (1979, 1981 and 1982).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Mears was born in Wichita, Kansas and raised in Bakersfield, California. He began his racing career in off-road racing. In 1976, he was recommended by a representative of Bill Simpson&#x27;s helmet company, and Simpson gave him a ride at the USAC Champ Car&#x27;s California 500 on an old Eagle-Offenhauser, finishing 8th. Simpson then sold the car to Art Sugai, on condition that Mears would continue driving it. In mid 1977 he switched to Theodore Racing.

His speed attracted the attention of Roger Penske. Although at the time Penske Racing had the services of Mario Andretti and Tom Sneva, Andretti was also racing in Formula One with Lotus, and Penske wanted another young driver who would focus exclusively on American racing. For 1978, Mears was offered a part-time ride in nine of the 18 championship races, filling in when Andretti was overseas. The arrangement also included a ride at the Indianapolis 500.

In his rookie appearance at Indy, Mears qualified on the front row and was the first rookie to qualify over 200 mph. When the race began, Mears discovered his helmet was not strapped on tight enough and he had to pit to get it safely secured. He did not lead a lap and retired at 104 laps with a blown engine. He ended up sharing &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; honors with Larry Rice. Two weeks later, the Rex Mays Classic at Milwaukee, he won his first race. He added another win a month later at Atlanta and rounded off the year with his first road course win at Brands Hatch. Because of his terrific showing as a rookie, Mears was elevated to full-time status for 1979 after teammate and series champion Tom Sneva and Penske parted company.

===1979===

In 1979 the National Championship sanction changed from the USAC to CART. At Indianapolis he won his first &quot;500&quot;, staying at the front of the field, taking advantage when Bobby Unser fell out of contention with mechanical trouble. Three wins and four second places in the eleven CART-eligible races won Mears his first championship. His worst finish in the season was seventh in Trenton&#x27;s second heat.

===1980===
In 1980 the ground effect Chaparral was technologically more advanced than the other chassis, and Johnny Rutherford drove it to his 3rd Indianapolis 500 win, going on to dominate the season. Mears finished in fourth place in the points with one win, scored at Mexico City.

In 1980 Mears was offered a Formula One test with Brabham by then team boss Bernie Eccelstone. Mears took interest in the test largely because of the ongoing split between CART and USAC and wanted other options in case CART fell apart. Mears tested with Brabham twice, once at Paul Ricard and once at Riverside. After adjusting his driving style to the Brabham BT49 Mears posted lap times within half a second of future three time Formula One champion and then Brabham driver Nelson Piquet at the first test. During the second test Mears posted lap times faster than Piquet&#x27;s. Piquet was so impressed with Mears&#x27; driving and enjoyed their time spent together so much that he endorsed bringing Mears on as a second driver. Eccelstone offered Mears a contract with Brabham that Mears ultimately declined. Mears would later say in his memoir that although he felt that Brabham was a strong team and that he had the skill to compete for wins in Formula One he was unsure about moving to Europe and was still interested in oval racing as the main reasons for declining Eccelstone&#x27;s offer.

===1981–1982===
The 1981 and 1982 seasons saw two more championships for Mears. Despite facial burns during a pit fire in the 1981 Indianapolis 500, Mears&#x27; ten race victories in the two-year span were enough for another two Indycar championship titles. At the 1982 Indianapolis 500 he came within 0.16 of a second of adding a second Indy win. With less than 20 laps to go, during Mears&#x27; final pit stop, the crew filled the entire tank rather than giving him only the amount he needed to finish. The delay left him more than 11 seconds behind Gordon Johncock. Mears made up the difference when Johncock suffered handling problems, but failed to secure the win. The photo finish stood for 10 years as the closest finish to an Indy 500. The photo-finish also muffled out the controversial pace-lap crash with teammate Kevin Cogan who appeared to have spun out for no apparent reason; fellow drivers such as Gordon Johncock, Johnny Rutherford, and Bobby Unser, charged Mears with causing the crash by bringing the field down at a slow pace.

===1983–1984===

For 1983 the Penske team acquired the Pennzoil sponsorship with its yellow paint scheme. Teammate Al Unser took that year&#x27;s title. The team switched to the March chassis for the 1984 Indianapolis 500 after the Penske chassis proved unsuccessful in the first two races of the year. Mears scored his second Indy win that May but suffered severe leg injuries later in the year in a crash at Sanair Super Speedway. The March chassis, like most contemporary open-wheel racing cars, sat the driver far forward in the nose, with little protection for the legs and feet.

===1985–1987===

After the Sanair crash, Mears was slowed by the injuries to his right foot that affected him throughout the remainder of his career. Over the next three seasons, he won only two races. He completed a comeback from his injuries by winning the 1985 Pocono 500. In 1986, he won the pole position for the Indianapolis 500, but finished 3rd. He also won the 1987 Pocono 500.

===1988–1990===

In 1988, after several years using the March chassis, the Penske team utilized a new car, the PC-17, with a Chevrolet racing engine. Mears used the new car to win the Indianapolis 500. A year later, he took a record-setting fifth pole position at Indy, but retired from the race with mechanical problems. Emerson Fittipaldi took the 500 and also beat Mears to the Championship in the last race at Laguna Seca Raceway, despite Mears winning that race. Also, that last race of 1989 set Mears apart from all other Indycar racers as he broke a tie with Bobby Rahal for race wins and became the most successful Indycar racer of the 1980s. In his winner&#x27;s circle interview, when asked about breaking his road course dry spell when his specialty has been ovals through the years, he replied to Jack Arute, &quot;Well, I guess there is hope for us old circle track drivers after all.&quot;

Fittipaldi joined Mears at Penske for 1990, but the year belonged to Al Unser Jr., who scored six wins. 1990 was Mears&#x27; last in the Pennzoil paint scheme as Marlboro took over as sponsor of the team, and Jim Hall re-entered Indycar.

===1991–1992===

In 1991 during a practice session Mears hit the wall at Indianapolis for the first time in his career. The next day, he climbed into his backup car and claimed his record 6th career pole position. Twenty laps from the end of the 500, it looked like Mears was set to be the runner-up behind Michael Andretti. However, when a subsequent yellow flag period erased Andretti&#x27;s 15-second lead, Mears gained the lead as Andretti opted to pit for fuel. It was a short-lived lead, as Andretti passed Mears around the outside into the first turn. A lap later Mears regained the lead, using the same move Andretti had. Turning up his turbocharger, he then pulled away to win a fourth Indy 500, becoming the third driver to do so. In August 1991, in the Michigan 500, he won his last race. 

At the 1992 Indianapolis 500 Mears broke a wrist in a crash during practice and then crashed out of the race for the first time in his career as he could not avoid Jim Crawford&#x27;s spinning car in turn 1. He raced only four more times in 1992 and then announced his retirement from racing at the Penske team&#x27;s Christmas party. No one except Penske himself and Rick&#x27;s wife, Chris, knew of his plans to retire. He had just turned 41 years old.

As of 2023, Rick Mears continues to work as a consultant and spotter for Penske Racing, the team with which he won all of his Indycar races. He has acted as a mentor for Penske drivers Helio Castroneves, Will Power, and Scott McLaughlin.

==Personal life==
Mears is the brother of Roger Mears, father of off-road and open-wheel racer Clint Mears, and the uncle of former NASCAR Cup Series driver Casey Mears. His marriage to his first wife Dina ended in divorce in 1983. He married Chris Bowen in 1986 whom he divorced in 2002.

<doc id="512301" wikidata="Q708593" url="?curid=512301" title="Karl Davydov">
<text>Karl Yulievich Davydov (; ) was a Russian cellist, described by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as the &quot;czar of cellists&quot;. He was also a composer, mainly for the cello. His name also appears in various different spellings: Davydov, Davidoff, Davidov, and more, with his first name sometimes written as Charles or Carl.

==Biography==
Davydov was the son of a Jewish physician and amateur violinist, Yuly Petrovich Davidhoff from Courland Governorate. His elder brother August Davidov was a noted mathematician and educator, and his nephew Alexei Davidov also became cellist and composer and also a businessman.

In his youth Davydov studied mathematics at St. Petersburg University, and then pursued a career as a composer, studying with Moritz Hauptmann at the Leipzig Conservatory. He became a full-time cello soloist in 1850 while continuing to compose. He took a post as a professor of cello at the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1863, and subsequently became director in 1878. In 1886 scandal forced him from his position, and Anton Rubinstein took the helm. He had many students, including Aleksandr Verzhbilovich.

He intended to write an opera on the subject of &quot;Mazeppa&quot;. Viktor Burenin wrote a libretto for this purpose in 1880, but when Davydov proved unable to find the time to compose, Burenin offered the libretto to Tchaikovsky. Although closely associated with Tchaikovsky, Karl Davydov was not related to the Princes Davydov, Russian Orthodox, into which Tchaikovsky&#x27;s sister Alexandra married.

Davydov was well-connected with a great number of the top-tier composers, musicians and nobility. In 1870 Count Wilhorsky, a patron of the arts, presented Davydov with a Stradivarius cello constructed in 1712. This cello, now known as the &quot;Davidov Stradivarius&quot;, was owned by Jacqueline du Pré until her death and is currently on loan to cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Several composers dedicated works to him, notably Tchaikovsy&#x27;s Cappricio Italien and Anton Arensky&#x27;s first piano trio.

Davydov went on to write his still-popular &quot;cello school&quot; book of etudes and technique, completed in 1888, taking the physical limitations into considerations for advancing the possibilities in both the bow hand and playing in the high registers. Davydov died in Moscow on 26 February 1889.

In 2019 a Moscow regional cello competition was established in his name.

==Cello transcriptions==
Davydov transcribed and arranged Chopin&#x27;s solo piano works for violoncello and piano accompaniment. Transcription albums of Walzer and Mazurkas published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. Another transcription album is a selection of Nocturnes and others solo piano works published by Edition Peters.

<doc id="512302" wikidata="Q234734" url="?curid=512302" title="Faustina the Elder">
<text>Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder, sometimes referred to as Faustina I or Faustina Major ( 100 – late October 140), was a Roman empress and wife of the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius. The emperor Marcus Aurelius was her nephew and later became her adopted son, along with Emperor Lucius Verus. She died early in the principate of Antoninus Pius, but continued to be prominently commemorated as a &quot;diva&quot;, posthumously playing a prominent symbolic role during his reign.

==Early life==
Faustina was the only known daughter of consul and prefect Marcus Annius Verus and Rupilia Faustina. Her brothers were consul Marcus Annius Libo and praetor Marcus Annius Verus. Her maternal aunts were Roman Empress Vibia Sabina and Matidia Minor. Her paternal grandfather was named Marcus Annius Verus, like her father, while her maternal grandparents were suffect consul Lucius Scribonius Libo Rupilius Frugi Bonus and possibly Vitellia. Faustina was born and raised in Rome.

While a private citizen, she married Antoninus Pius between 110 and 115. Faustina bore four children with Pius: two sons and two daughters. These were:
* Marcus Aurelius Fulvius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome. He is commemorated by a high-quality series of bronze coins, possibly struck at Rome, though their language is Greek.
* Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Aelius Lamia Silvanus or Syllanus. She appears to have had no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in Italy.
* Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or Faustina the Younger (between 125–130 to 175), a future Roman Empress; she married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. She was the only child who survived to see Antoninus and Faustina elevated to the imperial rank.

According to the unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, there were rumours while Antoninus was proconsul of Asia that Faustina conducted herself with &quot;excessive frankness and levity&quot;.

==Empress==
On July 10, 138, her uncle, the emperor Hadrian, died and her husband became the new emperor, as Antoninus was Hadrian&#x27;s adopted son and heir. Faustina became Roman Empress and the Senate accorded her the title of &quot;Augusta&quot;. As empress, Faustina was well respected and was renowned for her beauty and wisdom. Throughout her life, as a private citizen and as empress, Faustina was involved in assisting charities for the poor and sponsoring and assisting in the education of Roman children, particularly girls. A letter between Fronto and Antoninus Pius has sometimes been taken as an index of the latter&#x27;s devotion to her.

After Antoninus Pius&#x27; accession to the principate, the couple never left Italy; instead, they divided their time between Rome, Antoninus&#x27; favourite estate at Lorium, and other properties at Lanuvium, Tusculum, and Signia.

Faustina&#x27;s personal style was evidently much admired and emulated. Her distinctive hairstyle, consisting of braids pulled back in a bun behind or on top of her head, was imitated for two or three generations in the Roman world.

Several provincial groups chose to honour her while she was empress: a company of couriers in Ephesus named themselves after her, while a company of clapper-players in Puteoli dedicated an altar to her in her lifetime.

== Death and legacy ==
Faustina died near Rome in 140, perhaps at Antoninus Pius&#x27;s estate at Lorium. Antoninus was devastated at Faustina&#x27;s death and took several steps to honor her memory. He had the Senate deify her (her &quot;apotheosis&quot; was portrayed on an honorary column) and dedicate the Temple of Faustina to her in the Roman Forum. Because of this, Faustina was the first Roman empress with a permanent presence in the Forum Romanum. The Senate authorized gold and silver statues of her, including an image to appear in the circus, where it might be displayed in a &quot;carpentum&quot; (a kind of covered wagon) or &quot;currus elephantorum&quot; (a cart drawn by elephants). Antoninus also ordered various coins with her portrait struck, inscribed (&quot;Divine Faustina&quot;) and elaborately decorated. He also established a charity called &quot;Puellae Faustinianae&quot; (&quot;Girls of Faustina&quot;) to assist orphaned Roman girls and created a new &quot;alimenta&quot; (see Grain supply to the city of Rome). Her remains were interred in the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Certain cities struck coin issues in honour of the &quot;divine Faustina&quot; (); the most notable such cities were Delphi, Alexandria, Bostra, and Nicopolis. Martin Beckmann suggests that the coins of Nicopolis might have been minted at Rome and given out as imperial largesse at the Actian Games. The coins issued in the wake of Faustina&#x27;s funeral illustrate her elaborate funeral pyre, which may have influenced the design of later private mausolea; the deities Pietas and Aeternitas, among others; and an eagle (or less often a winged genius) bearing a figure aloft, with the legend (i.e. Faustina&#x27;s ascension into heaven). Coins of Faustina were sometimes incorporated into jewellery and worn as amulets.


The posthumous cult of Faustina was exceptionally widespread, and Faustina&#x27;s image continued to be omnipresent throughout Antoninus Pius&#x27; principate. A colossal marble head, believed to be that of Faustina and discovered in 2008, figured as one of several monumental imperial statues at the ancient site of Sagalassos in today&#x27;s Turkey. In Olympia, Herodes Atticus dedicated a nymphaeum that displayed statues of Faustina and other Antonines as well as his own ancestors. Faustina also appears on the Parthian Monument at Ephesus commemorating members of the imperial family. Bergmann and Watson have characterized the commemoration of Faustina as central to Antoninus Pius&#x27; political persona. One larger-than-life statue, discovered &quot;in situ&quot; near the Termini railway station at Rome, appears to depict Faustina as Concordia, with a patera and cornucopia; it would have been displayed alongside statues of Diana Lucifera and Apollo-Sol in baths privately owned but available to the public.

Antoninus and Faustina were officially held up as such exemplars of conjugal harmony that newlyweds were directed to pray at an altar of Antoninus and Faustina that they might live up to their example. This was evidently the case in Ostia, and probably so in Rome.

The Temple of Faustina is thought to have been dedicated in 144. It is a grand hexastyle structure with Corinthian columns, possibly designed originally to be a temple of Ceres. Depictions on coins appear to show a cult image of Faustina seated on a throne and holding a tall staff in her left hand. Faustina&#x27;s portrait on coins from this period is often crowned as well as veiled, which may also recall a feature of Faustina&#x27;s cult image from the temple.
The deified Faustina was associated particularly closely with Ceres, who featured prominently on coins of Faustina; for some years, the torch-bearing Ceres was the dominant motif in her gold coinage. Herodes Atticus venerated Faustina as the “new Demeter” (the Greek equivalent of Ceres) at a private sanctuary he established outside Rome, now the church of Sant&#x27;Urbano. In addition to Ceres, Vesta and Juno feature prominently in Faustina&#x27;s coinage. She was also associated with the Magna Mater and at Cyrene with Isis; at Sardis she was worshipped conjointly with Artemis.

Ten years after Faustina&#x27;s death, a new commemorative coinage was introduced, featuring the legend Aeternitas (&#x27;eternity&#x27;); such coins may have been introduced to be distributed at a public ceremony in her memory.

After Antoninus Pius&#x27; death, his adoptive sons and successors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus erected the Column of Antoninus Pius, which dramatically depicted Antoninus and Faustina being elevated heavenward together on the back of a winged figure.

Marcus Aurelius also built a Temple of Faustina at Elefsina in Greece.

Faustina continued to be commemorated in certain Renaissance depictions as a “model wife”.

<text>Linaria is a genus of almost 200 species of flowering plants, one of several related groups commonly called toadflax. They are annuals and herbaceous perennials, and the largest genus in the Antirrhineae tribe of the plantain family Plantaginaceae.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Linaria&quot; was traditionally placed in the family Scrophulariaceae. Phylogenetic analysis has now placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae.

Closely related genera include &quot;Nuttallanthus&quot; (American toadflaxes, recently split from &quot;Linaria&quot;), &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; (snapdragons) and &quot;Cymbalaria&quot; (ivy-leaved toadflaxes).

==Cultivation==
Several &quot;Linaria&quot; species are cultivated as garden plants, and some are regarded as having a weedy habit.

*Common toadflax or butter-and-eggs (&quot;Linaria vulgaris&quot;), a European species which is widely introduced elsewhere and grows as a common weed in some areas. 
*Broomleaf toadflax or Dalmatian toadflax (&quot;Linaria genistifolia&quot;, syn. &quot;L. dalmatica&quot;), a native of southeast Europe that has become a weed in parts of North America.
*Purple toadflax (&quot;Linaria purpurea&quot;), a species native to the Mediterranean region grown as a garden plant for its dark purple or pink flowers. The version with purple flowers can be mistaken for lavender. Spreads readily.
*Pale toadflax (&quot;Linaria repens&quot;), a species from western Europe similar to &quot;L. purpurea&quot;, but with paler flowers.
*Alpine toadflax (&quot;Linaria alpina&quot;), purple flowers with orange (or purple) lobes in the center. 
*Moroccan toadflax (&quot;Linaria maroccana&quot;), the flower has five lobes arranged into two lips with a spur at the end, often purple with white.

==Etymology==
The members of this genus are known in English as toadflax, a name shared with several related genera. The &#x27;toad&#x27; in toadflax may relate to the plants having historically been used to treat bubonic plague, a false link having been drawn between the words &#x27;bubo&#x27; and &#x27;Bufo&#x27;. The scientific name &quot;Linaria&quot; means &quot;resembling &quot;linum&quot;&quot; (flax), which the foliage of some species superficially resembles.

==Distribution and habitat==
The genus is native to temperate regions of Europe, northern Africa and Asia, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean region.

==Ecology==
Some &quot;Linaria&quot; are regarded as noxious weeds. They are likely toxic to livestock, but ruminants generally avoid them.

==Chemical composition==

&quot;Linaria&quot; species are rich in alkaloids, iridoids, terpenes, phenolic acids and flavonoids.

Vasicine, vasicinone, 7-hyrdoxyvasicine, linarinic acid, choline, linavuline, luteolin, acacetin, apigenin, chrysin, quercetin, myricetin, linarioside, aucubin, linaride, iridolinaroside A-D, and iridolinarin A-C are some compounds found in plants of this genus.

==Uses==
Toadflaxes are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the mouse moth (&quot;Amphipyra tragopoginis&quot;) and the common buckeye (&quot;Junonia coenia&quot;).

===Traditional medicine===
&quot;Linaria vulgaris&quot; has been used as a medicinal herb.

<doc id="512306" wikidata="Q1626979" url="?curid=512306" title="Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference">
<text>The Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) is a regional political party in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir union territory and Ladakh. Founded as the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference by Sheikh Abdullah and Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas in 1932 in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the organisation renamed itself to National Conference in 1939 in order to represent all the people of the state. It supported the accession of the princely state to India in 1947. Prior to that, in 1941, a group led by Ghulam Abbas broke off from the National Conference and revived the old Muslim Conference. The revived Muslim Conference supported the accession of the princely state to Pakistan and led the movement for Azad Kashmir.

Since 1947, the National Conference was in power in Jammu and Kashmir in one form or another till 2002, and again between 2009 and 2015. It implemented land reforms in the state, ensured the state&#x27;s autonomy under the Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, and formulated a separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir in 1957. Sheikh Abdullah&#x27;s son Farooq Abdullah (1981–2002, 2009–present) and grandson Omar Abdullah (2002–2009) have led the party after Sheikh Abdullah&#x27;s death as the president. The party is a member of the People&#x27;s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration electoral alliance.

==History==

=== The pre-independence period ===
In October 1932, Sheikh Abdullah founded the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference in collaboration with Mirwaiz Yusuf Shah and Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas. On 11 June 1939 it was renamed as the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference. This prompted a section of the leadership to break away and re-establish the Muslim Conference, with links to the All-India Muslim League. The National Conference was affiliated to the All India States Peoples Conference. Sheikh Abdullah was elected its president in 1947. In 1946, the National Conference launched an intensive agitation against the state government. It was directed against the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh. The slogan of the agitation was &quot;Quit Kashmir&quot;.

===The post-independence period===
In the elections held in September 1951, National Conference won all 75 seats of the Constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir. Sheikh Abdullah remained prime minister until his dismissal in August 1953 on the grounds of conspiracy against the state of India. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad became prime minister of the state, and Sheikh Abdullah was arrested on 9 August 1953.

In 1965, the National Conference merged with the Indian National Congress (INC) and became the Jammu and Kashmir branch of the Indian National Congress. Sheikh Abdullah was again arrested in 1965 until 1968 for conspiracy against the state. Sheikh Abdullah&#x27;s splinter Plebiscite Front faction later appropriated the name of the original party when Abdullah was allowed to return to power in February 1975 after striking a deal with the central government. In 1977, the National Conference he led won the state assembly elections, and Sheikh Abdullah became chief minister. His son Farooq Abdullah succeeded him as the chief minister on his death on 8 September 1982. In June 1983 elections, the JKNC, led by Farooq Abdullah, again won a comfortable majority.

In July 1984, Farooq&#x27;s brother-in-law Ghulam Mohammad Shah split the party. Acting on the behest of the central government, the governor dismissed Farooq as chief minister and replaced him with Ghulam Mohammad Shah. His government was dismissed in March 1986 and presidential rule was imposed. In the contested state assembly elections of 1987, the JKNC formed an alliance with the INC, and was declared to have won a majority. Farooq Abdullah again became chief minister and on Abdullah&#x27;s watch an insurgency against the state government and India began. Abdullah was dismissed again in 1990 by the union government and presidential rule was imposed in the state. In 1991, the state elections were cancelled due to a revolt by the people.

===1996 onwards===
In the Jammu and Kashmir state assembly elections in 1996, the JKNC led by Abdullah was awarded the election yet again winning 57 seats out of a total 87. Like its predecessors, this election has been deemed to be rigged and Abdullah stepped down in 2000. His son, Omar Abdullah then took up the reins of power in the state. But in 2002 state assembly elections, the JKNC won only 28 seats, with the Jammu and Kashmir People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) emerging in the Kashmir Valley as a contender for power. In the December 2008 state assembly elections, no single party was able to get the majority. The JKNC led by Farooq&#x27;s son Omar Abdullah emerged as a single largest party, winning 28 seats. After the elections, on 30 December 2008 the JKNC formed an alliance with the INC which had won 17 seats. Omar Abdullah became the chief minister of this coalition government on 5 January 2009.

JKNC and INC contested 2009 general election in alliance. INC won all the two seats of Jammu region but lost Ladakh seat to NC rebel who contested as an independent candidate. NC won all the three seats of the Kashmir Valley in 2009.

During this period, the JKNC has experienced increasing controversies over the Accession of Kashmir to India. Protests against the government in 2010 when approximately 100 protesters (one as young as 11) were killed as the result of live ammunition being fired by state paramilitary forces. A torture scandal was exposed by the WikiLeaks, revelations which were subsequently aired on Channel 4.

In the 2014 general election, the NC contested the election in an alliance with Indian National Congress but did not win a single seat. Out of six seats in the state, PDP and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won three each.

During the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, INC broke its alliance with JKNC. JKNC contested all the assembly seats but won only 15 seats, a decrease of 13 seats. PDP won 28 seats and became the largest party in the assembly followed by BJP winning 25 seats. Omar Abdullah resigned as a chief minister on 24 December 2014.
In 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, J&amp;K National Conference won 42 seats in total, while BJP came second with 29 seats won and Omar Abdullah became the chief minister of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
== Party flag ==
The flag of Jammu and Kashmir National Conference had its origin in events on 13 July 1931 in Srinagar, when Kashmiri Muslims were protesting outside the Srinagar Central Jail premises at Srinagar where Abdul Qadeer was arrested on the charge of inciting public against the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir by Dogra state forces. The blood-tainted shirt of one of the victims was then hoisted by the crowd as the new flag of Kashmir.
On 11 July 1939, the flag was adopted by the JKNC as it&#x27;s official flag.

==Article 370 and after ==
After the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, which revoked Jammu and Kashmir&#x27;s special status, the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has been advocating for its restoration. In their 2024 election manifesto, the party pledged to fight for the reinstatement of Article 370 and the region&#x27;s statehood. They also proposed repealing post-2019 laws that they argue adversely impact the region&#x27;s autonomy. Additionally, the JKNC aims to encourage dialogue between India and Pakistan to address the Kashmir issue

The revocation of Article 370 was part of the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s (BJP) efforts to fully integrate Jammu and Kashmir into India, a move that has faced significant opposition from local political parties like the JKNC. The National Conference&#x27;s current leadership, including Omar Abdullah, has reiterated their determination to pursue statehood and autonomy through legal and political channels.

2024 Jammu and Kashmir elections

The 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections were scheduled to be held in three phases: September 18, September 25, and October 1, 2024. This was the first election since the revocation of the special status in 2019. The election decided 90 seats in the assembly.

The results were announced on October 8, 2024. Key parties contesting include: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (NC), Indian National Congress (INC), and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)

After Jammu and Kashmir elections

the party secured record seats 42 to be exact being the single largest party in j and k even beating the bjp leader by decisive 7,819 votes the party has also passed the 2024 Jammu and Kashmir autonomy resolution in the assembly.

<doc id="512310" wikidata="Q5282519" url="?curid=512310" title="Disorders of calcium metabolism">
<text>Disorders of calcium metabolism occur when the body has too little or too much calcium. The serum level of calcium is closely regulated within a fairly limited range in the human body. In a healthy physiology, extracellular calcium levels are maintained within a tight range through the actions of parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and the calcium sensing receptor. Disorders in calcium metabolism can lead to hypocalcemia, decreased plasma levels of calcium or hypercalcemia, elevated plasma calcium levels.

==Hypocalcemia==

Hypocalcemia is common and can occur unnoticed with no symptoms or, in severe cases, can have dramatic symptoms and be life-threatening. Hypocalcemia can be parathyroid related or vitamin D related. Parathyroid related hypocalcemia includes post-surgical hypoparathyroidism, inherited hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism. Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism is the most common form, and can be temporary (due to suppression of tissue after removal of a malfunctioning gland) or permanent, if all parathyroid tissue has been removed. Inherited hypoparathyroidism is rare and is due to a mutation in the calcium sensing receptor. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is maternally inherited and is categorized by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Finally, pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism is paternally inherited. Patients display normal parathyroid hormone action in the kidney, but exhibit altered parathyroid hormone action in the bone.
Vitamin D related hypocalcemia may be associated with a lack of vitamin D in the diet, a lack of sufficient UV exposure, or disturbances in renal function. Low vitamin D in the body can lead to a lack of calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism (hypocalcemia and raised parathyroid hormone). Symptoms of hypocalcemia include numbness in fingers and toes, muscle cramps, irritability, impaired mental capacity and muscle twitching.

==Hypercalcemia==

Hypercalcemia is suspected to occur in approximately 1 in 500 adults in the general adult population. Like hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia can be non-severe and present with no symptoms, or it may be severe, with life-threatening symptoms. Hypercalcemia is most commonly caused by hyperparathyroidism and by malignancy, and less commonly by vitamin D intoxication, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and by sarcoidosis. Hyperparathyroidism occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women. Hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a tumor, or adenoma, in the parathyroid gland or by increased levels of parathyroid hormone due to hypocalcemia. Approximately 10% of individuals with cancer experience hypercalcemia due to malignancy. Hypercalcemia occurs most commonly in breast cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, myeloma, and colon cancer. It may be caused by secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide by the tumor (which has the same action as parathyroid hormone), or may be a result of direct invasion of the bone, causing calcium release.
Symptoms of hypercalcemia include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, lethargy, depression, confusion, polyuria, polydipsia and generalized aches and pains.

==Plasma Calcium==

The amount of biologically active calcium varies with the level of serum albumin, a protein to which calcium is bound, and therefore levels of &quot;ionized calcium&quot; are better measures than a &quot;total calcium&quot;; however, one can correct a &quot;total calcium&quot; if the albumin level is known.
* A normal &quot;ionized calcium&quot; is 1.12-1.45 mmol/L (4.54-5.61 mg/dL).
* A normal &quot;total calcium&quot; is 2.2-2.6 mmol/L (9-10.5 mg/dl).
** &quot;Total calcium&quot; of less than 8.0 mg/dL is hypocalcaemia, with levels below 1.59 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) generally fatal.
** &quot;Total calcium&quot; of more than 10.6 mg/dL is hypercalcaemia, with levels over 3.753 mmol/L (15.12 mg/dL) generally fatal.

<text>State University of New York Brockport (also known as SUNY Brockport or Brockport State, and previously The College at Brockport) is a public university in Brockport, New York, United States. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY).

== History ==
SUNY Brockport was originally founded in 1835 as an institution of higher learning as the Brockport Collegiate Institute.

Over thirty years later, the school, through the leadership of principal Malcolm MacVicar, was absorbed into a New York-wide system of state-run normal schools in 1867 and changed its name to the Brockport State Normal School. For the next seven decades, the new institution would be primarily dedicated to training teachers, although other academic programs were maintained. 

In 1942, the school gained the right to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees and was renamed as the Brockport State Teachers College. Six years later, the college joined the newly-established State University of New York system, becoming the State University of New York at Brockport. Only two years later, Brockport State began to grant graduate degrees, with the first master&#x27;s degrees awarded in 1950.

Later name changes occurred in 2005, becoming the College at Brockport, State University of New York, and 2020, when it adopted a name similar to its 1948 original one, the State University of New York Brockport.

==Clubs and organizations==

===Greek life===

In 1869, with the assistance of Professor Charles Donald McLean, the principal of the school, Gamma Sigma fraternity was established at The Brockport Normal School. Gamma Sigma was the first fraternity to be formed at the high school level in the United States. On October 11 of that year, eighteen young men gathered in the chemistry room with the aim of enhancing their skills in debate, original composition, and other literary exercises. The founding members were: Edward L. Adams, John D. Burns, Charles Cunningham, William K. Dean, Martin L. Deyo, John Norris Drake, A. James Knox, S. E. Loomis, John M. Milne, A. Judson Osborn, Frederick Palmer, George T. Quinby, George Hebert Raymond, William H. Sybrandt, James W. White, Stephen D. Wilbur, Ara Wilkinson, and George F. Yeoman. Mr. Yeoman was elected as the first President, and James Knox served as the chairman of the constitution committee.

On a side note, in later years Mr. Yeoman took the oath of office as a justice of the Supreme Court for the Seventh Judicial District of the State on November 15, 1893. In the book &quot;Notable Men of Rochester&quot; published in 1902 by Dwight J. Stoddard, there is a mention of Mr. Yeoman&#x27;s high level of respect and admiration.

<doc id="512316" wikidata="Q1502470" url="?curid=512316" title="Bray Productions">
<text>Bray Productions was a pioneering American animation studio that produced several popular cartoons during the years of World War I and the early interwar era, becoming a springboard for several key animators of the 20th century, including the Fleischer brothers, Walter Lantz, Paul Terry, Shamus Culhane and Grim Natwick among others.

== History ==
The studio was founded sometime before 1912 by John Randolph Bray. It was perhaps one of the first studios entirely devoted to serial animation at the time instead of one-off experiments. Its first series was Bray&#x27;s &quot;Colonel Heeza Liar&quot;, but from the beginning, the studio brought in outsiders to direct promising new series. Carl Anderson, later known for the comic strip &quot;Henry&quot;, directed &quot;The Police Dog&quot; from the beginning of the company.

The year 1915 brought Earl Hurd and Paul Terry; the former became J. R. Bray&#x27;s business partner and directed &quot;Bobby Bumps&quot;, the latter was employed under duress and directed &quot;Farmer Al Falfa&quot;. The brothers Max and Dave Fleischer joined in 1916. In 1918, the rival International Film Service studio folded and owner William Randolph Hearst licensed Bray to continue the IFS series, which included &quot;Jerry on the Job&quot; films adapted from Walter Hoban&#x27;s comic strip. Many staff members of the former studio transferred to Bray, and most of the new cartoons were directed by the same man who directed them for IFS, Gregory La Cava.

Bray&#x27;s goal was to have four units working on four cartoons at any one time; since it took a month to complete a film, four units with staggered schedules produced one cartoon a week for use of the &quot;screen magazines&quot; (a one-reel collection of live-action didactic pieces and travelogs in addition to the cartoon, that was played before the feature). Bray started with Pathé as his distributor, switched to Paramount in 1916, and then switched to Goldwyn Pictures in 1919.

Of the units, one produced his &quot;Colonel Heeza Liar&quot;, one produced Hurd&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Bumps&quot;, and one produced non-series cartoons, usually topical commentaries on the news directed by Leighton Budd, J. D. Leventhal, and others. The fourth unit was the one that kept changing hands. It produced Terry&#x27;s &quot;Farmer Al Falfa&quot; in 1916, until Terry left a year later, and the Farmer went with him. It then produced Max Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; until 1921, when Fleischer left, taking Koko the Clown with him. The influx of IFS series at the same time broke up the four-unit system — in 1920 there were ten series going simultaneously, with &quot;Heeza Liar&quot; in hiatus from 1917.

Bray was constantly looking to expand his studio. He financed the semi-independent studio of C. Allen Gilbert to create a series of serious &quot;Silhouette Fantasies&quot; on classical themes (he actually did some of the animation work for this series). In 1917 he bought out his distributor&#x27;s screen magazine to produce one of his own, moving him into the realm of live-action shorts producer. During World War I, he assigned Leventhal and Max Fleischer&#x27;s units to create training and educational cartoons for the U.S. Army. These did so well that after the war, Bray was swamped with orders from the government and big business to make films for them.

Over a period of years, Bray moved the focus of his company from entertainment to education, putting Leventhal and E. Dean Parmelee in charge of the technical department. Dr. Rowland Rogers became educational director, while Jamison &quot;Jam&quot; Handy was put in charge of a Chicago–Detroit branch for creating films for the auto industry, Bray&#x27;s largest private client.

The 1919 move from Paramount to Goldwyn also included a re-incorporation of the studio, now called Bray Pictures Corporation. The studio was putting out more than three reels of screen magazines per week, as well as educational and training films. Bray Pictures also made the first cartoon made in color, &quot;The Debut of Thomas Cat&quot;, shot in Brewster Color and released on February 8, 1920 (although some claim the first animated short was the British &quot;In Gollywog Land&quot;, a stop motion/live-action hybrid shot in Kinemacolor and made in 1912 or the animation/live-action hybrid &quot;Pinto&#x27;s Prizma Comedy Revue&quot; made by Pinto Colvig in 1919 and shot in the Prizma process) and was apparently involved in an unnamed sound-on-film cartoon by Walt Lantz (co-producer/director) and Hugo Riesenfeld (composer) in 1927 for Movietone, in between the releases of &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and coincidentally shortly before Bray Pictures&#x27; demise.

The expenses quickly outweighed the revenue, and in January 1920, Samuel Goldwyn bought a controlling interest in Bray Pictures and ordered a massive reorganization. Max Fleischer and J. D. Leventhal became supervising directors of the entertainment and technical branches of the studio respectively, and the company was streamlined to work more like Goldwyn Picture Corporation, with two cartoons released a week, which meant a much bigger workload than most were willing to take.

The result was a massive exodus of talent, including Max Fleischer and even Earl Hurd, which also led to an increasingly poor output which led Goldwyn to drop Bray Pictures. In the wake of this setback, Vernon Stallings took over as Bray&#x27;s entertainment production supervisor, being replaced by Walter Lantz by 1924. Stallings directed &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and the revival of &quot;Heeza Liar&quot;, while Lantz directed &quot;Dinky Doodle&quot;. Among the big names who passed through the studio were Wallace Carlson, Milt Gross, Frank Moser, Burt Gillett, Grim Natwick, Raoul Barré, Pat Sullivan, Jack King, David Hand, Clyde Geronimi and Shamus Culhane.

J.R. Bray paid little attention to the animation side of things during the 1920s, focusing instead on beating Hal Roach as the king of two-reel comedy, with the disastrous series &quot;The McDougall Alley Kids&quot;. When this adventure failed, he slipped out of the business. Meanwhile, Walter Lantz practically became a full-fledged producer as head of the cartoon division, with some trade publications referring to the studio as &quot;Lantz-Bray&quot; by the time the entertainment branch of Bray Pictures Corporation closed in 1928. The educational/commercial branch, Brayco, made mostly filmstrips from the 1920s until it closed in 1963. The Jam Handy Organization began life as a subsidiary of Bray Studios to fulfill its business contracts, making several thousand industrial and sponsored films and tens of thousands of filmstrips, mostly for the automobile industry, as an independent entity from 1928 until 1983. Max Fleischer, after being ousted from his own studio in the early 1940s, worked for Handy and later on Brayco in the 1940s and 1950s.

<text>The State University of New York at Fredonia (alternatively SUNY Fredonia, Fredonia State, or Fredonia) is a public university in Fredonia, New York. It is the westernmost member of the State University of New York. Founded in 1826, it is the sixty-sixth-oldest institute of higher education in the United States, seventh-oldest college in New York, and second-oldest public school in New York (SUNY and CUNY) after SUNY Potsdam (1816).

Fredonia was one of the state teachers&#x27; colleges traditionally specializing in music education, but now offers programs in other areas, including a graduate division. Areas of study include science, communication, music, education, and the social sciences. There are over 80 majors and over 50 minors.

==History==

===Fredonia Academy (1826–1867)===
Opened in 1826 as Fredonia Academy under its first principal Austin Smith, the academy enrolled eight students. The first classes began on October 4, 1826. Within one year the academy had 136 students, 81 boys and 55 girls. In 1827 it was a state normal school.

The academy reached peak enrollment in 1856 with 217 students. The school was plagued by financial shortages and was forced to close its doors in 1867.

===Normal School (1867–1948)===
In 1867, the college re-emerged for its second phase of existence, as a New York State Normal School. On December 2, 1867, the Fredonia Normal School (as it became commonly known) began classes with 147 students, 62 boys and 85 girls. For students preparing to be teachers, no tuition was charged, books were supplied, and travel costs were reimbursed; in return, students had to promise to teach after graduation. Those students not studying for the teaching profession paid tuition and provided their own textbooks.

During its 82 years, Fredonia Normal had a tumultuous existence. With a fluctuating student enrollment and threats of state funding reductions, the school seemed to be in constant jeopardy of closing. Nonetheless, gradually the school was upgraded. In 1930, of land west of Central Avenue in the Village of Fredonia were bought to house a future campus. In 1938, music building (Mason Hall) was the first to be constructed on the Central Avenue site. New York State Governor Herbert Lehman signed the Feinberg Law in 1942 that changed all state Normal Schools into Teacher Colleges. With this new law, the school officially became the Fredonia State Teachers College.

===State University System (1948–present)===
With the formation of the State University of New York on March 13, 1948, the school&#x27;s name changed again, becoming the State University of New York College at Fredonia. The college created a Division of the Humanities in 1958, and, in 1960, Fredonia was selected by State University to grant the A.B. degree. Previously, Fredonia&#x27;s curriculum was restricted for teacher training only.

From the 1940s through the early 1960s, additional buildings were erected: Fenton Hall (administration), Jewett Hall (sciences), Dods Hall (physical education and athletics), an addition to Mason Hall, and residence halls Gregory, Alumni, McGinnies, Chautauqua, and Nixon.

In 1968, the master plan for the modern Central Avenue campus was drafted by the architectural firm of I. M. Pei &amp; Partners of New York at the request of then-president Oscar E. Lanford. A complex came into being that consisted of the Rockefeller Arts Center (building for fine arts), Maytum Hall (administration), Daniel A. Reed Library, McEwen Hall, Campus Center student union (now Williams Center), Houghton Hall (sciences), and LoGrasso Medical Center (infirmary). Maytum Hall, McEwen Hall (lecture rooms), Reed Library, and the Williams Center were all inter-connected, including an elevated walkway connecting McEwen Hall and the Williams Center. Also included in the plan were the suite-style residence halls Kasling, Disney, Grissom, Eisenhower, and Erie Dining Hall (now closed); In 1970, Pei and Cobb returned to Fredonia to construct the second suite-style residence halls of Hemingway, Schulz, Igoe, and Hendrix.

In the early 1970s a second addition was made to Mason Hall (including practice rooms), science building Houghton Hall, and multi-discipline Thompson Hall. In 1981, construction was finally begun on the long-awaited major indoor sports facility, Steele Hall, which had been delayed for nearly nine years due to state funding difficulties throughout much of the 1970s. More recent campus buildings and additions have been the University Commons residence and dining hall, additions to Steele and Mason Halls, and another long-awaited project—the new science building adjoining Houghton Hall. A stadium for athletics—mainly soccer and lacrosse—which included an upgraded, lighted playing field, was recently built over the existing playing fields.

Between 1981 and 1999, the school was an official training camp site of Buffalo Bills.

In 2023, the college received university designation from the state of New York, thus changing its name to its current State University of New York at Fredonia. Because of the university&#x27;s multiple graduate level programs, SUNY Fredonia met the requirement for this change, that a state college have at least three.

===Presidents===

*Note: Earlier Presidents were Principals of Fredonia Academy and are not included list.

==Buildings==

===Architectures===
Architects I. M. Pei and Henry N. Cobb designed the master plan for the modernized campus in 1968. Many of the buildings are listed in architectural guides as examples of exceptional modern architecture. Some are described in architectural history books. The National Building Museum listed the SUNY Fredonia campus as one of I. M. Pei&#x27;s ideal places to visit in its 1991 journal &quot;Blueprints&quot;.

Pei is credited with designing Maytum Hall, Williams Center, Reed Library, Rockefeller Arts Center, and McEwen Hall, as well as its characteristic circular perimeter road, aptly named Ring Road. The design of Daniel Reed Library earned Henry Cobb and I. M. Pei the 1969 Prestressed Concrete Institute Award.
===Academic and administrative buildings===
*Reed Library was constructed in 1969. It is approximately the size of a regulation football field, provides seating for over 850 readers, and houses over 250,000 books. It is named for Daniel A. Reed (1875–1959), U.S. Representative from the Fredonia area for over 40 years. A four-story addition to Reed Library, known as the Carnahan-Jackson Center, was constructed in 1992; it includes several study areas, a scholarship center, atrium, elevators, tower study lounge which leads to a fifth story, the Tutoring Center, and the Special Collections &amp; Archives Division of Reed Library.
*Michael C. Rockefeller Arts Center, constructed in 1968, is named after the youngest son of former Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, who disappeared in 1961 during an anthropological expedition in New Guinea. Designed by I. M. Pei and Partners, Rockefeller Arts Center includes King Concert Hall (a 1,200-seat concert hall), Marvel Theatre (a 400-seat proscenium theatre), Alice E. Bartlett Theatre (a 200-seat maximum black box theatre), an art gallery, and 24 classrooms. This building houses the Department of Theatre and Dance, and the Department of Visual Arts and New Media. The arts center was opened in 1968 by Clint Norton as its first managing director. He was followed by Robert B. D&#x27;Angelo who served from 1970 to 1974 while he also served as a speech writer and adviser to then Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Following D&#x27;Angelo in the directorship were Ted Dede, Nancy Palmer, Katherine Rushworth and Radford Thomas. Jefferson Westwood has served as director since 1982.
*Fenton Hall was named for Reuben Fenton (1819–1885), U.S. Senator, and Governor, who was born in Carroll, Chautauqua County. Fenton Hall houses the office of the University President, the Graduate Studies office, as well as classrooms, academic departments and Sprout Café. Computer Science, Modern Languages, English, and Philosophy are some of the departments located in Fenton.
*Mason Hall is home to the School of Music and was named after American music education pioneer Lowell Mason. This hall is actually three buildings, &quot;Old Mason&quot; (the oldest building on the present-day campus site), &quot;New Mason,&quot; and the recent addition of two rehearsal rooms, which are all connected together. Mason Hall includes over 100 personal practice rooms, several small ensemble practice rooms, and large ensemble rooms. Both Juliet J. Rosch Recital Hall and Diers Recital Hall are located here, as well as two MIDI technology labs, and a Studio Recording Department.
*Maytum Hall is an eight-story, semi-circular office building and computer center, and was named after Arthur Maytum (1866–1953). He served as chairman of the Board of Visitors of the Fredonia Normal School and Teachers college from 1928 to 1953. He also served as supervisor of the Town of Pomfret from 1931 to 1938. 
*Steele Hall is mainly used as a sports center with a basketball court, indoor track, and an ice rink which are used for both campus and community events. It also contains classrooms, a newly constructed natatorium, racquetball courts, dancing practice rooms, and many other facilities.
*Thompson Hall is the largest academic building at SUNY Fredonia. It houses the departments of Multicultural Affairs, Psychology, Political Science, Speech Pathology, Sociology, Business Administration, History, plus the College of Education. The building, planned during the period of nationwide campus upheavals in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was designed to be riot-proof, with its narrow stairwells, dimly lighted hallways, and no operable windows.
*Houghton Hall, Jewett Hall, and the Science Center are the three science buildings at SUNY Fredonia. They house the departments of Geology, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Biochemistry, and the 3-2 Cooperative Engineering Program. The Science Center features an observatory, a greenhouse, and an herbarium.
*LoGrasso Hall On campus medical services, along with counseling, and the office of international education.
*McEwen Hall Four-level building, Contains lecture halls, Sheldon Media Labs, and Fredonia Radio Systems (WCVF-FM).
*The College Lodge, located in Brocton, NY and operated by the Faculty Student Association at SUNY Fredonia, is a nature reserve and a certified experiential training facility and conference and events center that offers workforce development, employee training, meetings and other services for businesses and organizations. 
*The Center for Innovation &amp; Economic Development (CIED), located in Dunkirk, NY, is a facility that encourages and instructs the development of small businesses and entrepreneurship skills. The CIED was formerly called the Fredonia Technology Incubator.

===Residence halls===
SUNY Fredonia has 15 residence halls. Students have a choice of building style: corridor, suite, kitchen suite, or independent living. Corridor-style residence halls are long, staggered hallways with no sections, whereas suites are short corridors with either staggered hallways extending from the main corridor or doors leading into the individual suites.

==Student life==

===On campus student media===
WCVF-FM is a public FM radio station located in McEwen Hall, broadcasting from the top of Maytum Hall on campus. Licensed to the State University of New York at Fredonia, the station broadcasts on 88.9 MHz on the FM dial. &quot;CVF&quot; stands for &quot;Campus and Community Voice of Fredonia,&quot; the station&#x27;s slogan. The station primarily features &quot;alternative&quot; rock, but includes an eclectic mix of genres at consistent times throughout the week. Listeners can catch blocks of Polka, Spanish, Blues, Jazz, Folk, Reggae, Hip Hop and anything in between. Live programs hosted by student and community jocks can be of any format/genre from talk, music, to radio drama. WCVF also covers local sports and includes live broadcasts/commentary for several Blue Devil teams. WCVF broadcasts National Public Radio (NPR) Monday through Friday: Morning Edition (7–9 am) and All Things Considered (4–6 pm). These broadcasts are achieved through a partnership with NPR member station WQLN-FM in Erie, Pennsylvania. WCVF-FM has a sister station WDVL which broadcasts via internet streaming and a local cable channel.

&quot;The Normal Leader&quot; was created in May 1892 by the Agonian Society, an all-male literary organization, and later the Zetesian Society, an all-female organization. The first issues were entirely handwritten, and printed issues began with a renumbered Volume 1, Issue 1 in February 1893. &quot;The Normal Leader&quot; was a monthly newspaper, costing ten cents a copy or fifty cents for a yearly subscription. On September 28, 1936 &quot;The Normal Leader&quot; became &quot;The Leader&quot; on its Vol. XXXVI article No. 3 even though the school would not change its name to SUNY Fredonia until 1948. &quot;The Leader&quot; is produced by a team of Fredonia students, some of whom receive stipends from the Student Association. &quot;The Leader&quot; is printed by the &quot;Corry Journal&quot; in Corry, Pennsylvania and is distributed free on campus and in the surrounding community. Today, The Leader features mainly news which is pertinent to the SUNY Fredonia campus and community. This weekly publication comes out every Wednesday during the academic year and can be found around the SUNY Fredonia Campus.

&quot;WNYF&quot; is the Student television station of the university. WNYF is sponsored by the Student Association, and was founded in 1979 by two communications students. WNYF&#x27;s programming includes student-produced programs ranging from entertainment, music, educational television and even a student-written soap opera. In the station&#x27;s first few months of existence, it began televising the annual dance marathon that raised funds for muscular dystrophy. WNYF maintains an archive of every show produced by the students since 1979. The station was relocated several times, and WNYF settled into its current location in Hendrix Hall in 1997. WNYF broadcasts to the campus on cable TV Channel 8, and to the Public-access television on Channels 17 in Fredonia and 19 in Dunkirk.

The Blue Devils are a member of the State University of New York Athletic Conference (SUNYAC). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, ice hockey, soccer, swimming &amp; diving and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

When SUNY Fredonia was first known as the Fredonia Normal School, the athletics teams were known as the &quot;Normalites&quot;. On January 27, 1936, &quot;The Leader&quot; issued an article which publicized a contest to come up with a new name for the teams. There were two names the committee had chosen, Blue Jackets and Blue Devils. The name Blue Devils seemed to be used more than Blue Jackets. In the issue of &quot;The Leader&quot; on September 30, 1952; the name Blue Devils was used officially for the first time.
